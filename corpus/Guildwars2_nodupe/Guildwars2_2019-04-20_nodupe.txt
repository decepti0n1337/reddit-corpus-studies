It's OK not to like RPGs, there  are plenty of other games you can play.
---
---
---
An example of different functionality is winds of disenchantment will now reflect projectiles when traited with shield mastery
---
All accounts get wiped and you have to pay another 50 bucks to start playing again.
---
What the hell.
---

---
I mean, not saying that stuff doesn't sound great - I'd kill to have all of it. But, at the rate we see new content and the amount we see in expansions? 
---
Yeah, no. 
---
I don't see it ever happening, and that's not just me being negative about ArenaNet's development pace or otherwise - this sort of thing is a massive undertaking that we don't see the likes of in any game, with the exception of maybe FFXIV going into A Realm Reborn and essentially relaunching the entire game (that was a much bigger project that might as well have equated to another game, though, which is why the stuff Teapot talks about here makes more sense for a GW3.)
---
yeah, Deadeye D/D is pretty good, but it's too dependent on conditions on foes and boons on you, so I was wanted D/D daredevil to be a thing, do you think that now with more general traits that might become reality?
---
Honestly, Scourge. Sure, Reaper comes ahead a bit in open world but Scourge is good pretty much anywhere else so might as well stick to that. Also condi gear is way cheaper anyway.
---
I mean you can still gather people and do most early parts of the metas with a small party if you have a tag. So casuals can still experience the smaller stages of the meta without reliance on a full map the entire time. This allows the maps to age well after people have completed achievements and collections they need, because no one is trying to spend 1 hour in the map for no reason.
---
Honestly all of underwater should automatically be a water combo field.
---
OMG Berserker changes ! I cant wait for that new arc divider, its finally the spin I've always wanted on warriors
---
The financial cushion is there *because* of Hearthstone. The engine overhauls occurred during financial declines of WoW *before the subsequent games were released*. Sometimes you have to spend money to make money, and that's where a company like ANet tends to falter (disregarding the engine overhaul discussion, this goes beyond that). Most game companies are businesses first. ANet has tried to break that trend (which it ironically didn't, because Blizzard originally wasn't a business first but when it became one, the ANet founders split off. ANet is not trying to be a business first, but NCSoft has been pushing them since before GW2 launched).
---
Additionally, a game that has been successful for 10 years and is no longer successful doesn't have that big of a cushion. Most of the money from the success goes back towards development. The development needs to be driven towards profit unless the company truly has a big enough cushion they don't care (see: Google). The remaining money doesn't stay as a "cushion", it goes to the executives as bonuses or raises.
---
Now you might say that, well, the money going back into development **is** the cushion. Sure, but when you're tasked with a subsystem and given a certain amount of money, that means you're given fairly strict constraints. Sure, most of the employees are salaried, so that means the money given isn't necessarily in terms of money, but in terms of work hours. So you have X amount of hours to complete this task. You will have a team of Y size, and yif you go over that, the money just isn't there and you're pulling into other project funds.
---
This happens in Blizzard, this happens in FFXIV, this happens in GW2. 
---
Now to your other point...  
---
&gt; GW2 has undergone minor engine re-works such as the removal of culling, but somehow, that's not really what people have in mind when they talk about an "engine re-work,"
---
Except, minor sub-systems, like culling, are natural in a game's progression. Technically any and all changes to the game are changes to the game's engine. Do we consider balance patches as important game engine changes? Not really. While they are necessary for the future of the game, they aren't improving how the game plays on machines. Additionally, specifically for culling, that doesn't end up helping optimization. It generally just means tweaking a few values in the back-end and then updating the way draw calls works (which, ironically, ends up slowing certain parts down). When a character gets loaded, it now loads the "base model" first, then it loads the specific items. Sure, adding one base model is not that heavy on your RAM, but the client now has to process when to make the switch, as well as it still suffering from not loading models when there are too many (ie culling) and the GPU (or, in this case, CPU, thanks DX9) chugging away to monitor, update, and output all the draw calls.
---
I'm going to switch to a more technical analysis here, as I do have a background in programming. DX9 has a fairly large overhead when ran. You can't really reduce this. It also shoves many of the calls to the CPU before the GPU, which defeats the point. The GPU is capable of handling many more calls than the CPU because it's just a sweatshop churning out what the foreman (CPU) tells it to. Ideally a game will send as many calls as possible to the GPU, specifically draw calls, to make use of it. The simplest way of doing that is to have multiple foremen each shouting at the GPU (it makes stuff really fast, many times faster than a foreman can shout). However, DX9 tends to be single core, as it was created before duocore, quadcore, and other multi-core solutions were fully adopted. This means that you generally have one foreman, but you can add more it's just more work and the original foreman has to yell at the other foremen, making it a bit redundant in most cases (and sometimes slower than just not running in parallel). The largest issues in terms of client performance with GW2 are it using CPU more than GPU (which can be fine, we have CPUs that are vastly powerful, but it isn't because...) and mainly one thread (running on a single core, which means that your sweet i9-9900K [this is a real processor] is only using **one** of it's 8 cores).
---
I'm metting the welcome back to gw2 event will lead up to the next episode.
---
Fuck no.
---
They aren't randomly picking those runes or traits or anything about build, ya know?
---
Reaper will definitely like it
---
Did I say that?
---
All I am saying is: use your braincells and find out why something is used, and what option you should use in your case.
---
it only took them 6 months after HoT released to implement that patch
---
meanwhile, PoF is a year and 7 months old....
---
I think the argument could be made that having video games as a hobby isn't exactly a healthy way to spend your time since you're immersing yourself in a 'phantasy' environment, and what's really going on here is that you're getting unreasonably steamed over something that has literally zero impact on you to the point where you feel it's necessary to claim that OP has some kind of mental illness (i mean, what?).
---
Bunker builds do laughable damage so that's an obvious downside.
---
And also Unblockable
---
&gt; It feels so great to fly around in HoT maps because they were already made for gliding.
---
And now we can dismount in verdant brink and use updrafts, lul
---
heal rev has always been good
---
Seriously it’s so great with the dismount.
---
I live in Algeria (Africa). Can I buy this? if no is there any other way I could buy it?
---
Let's not get crazy here dude.  Ask for things that actually have a chance of happening.
---
Yeah you are right, no reason to improve old content when you can pump out a new empty map every few month. :(
---
I'm not sure why you bring up GW2 Raidar because it clearly shows thief being very strong on most bosses, usually at the top for power classes. Power Chrono loses dps when it takes Feedback.
---
Read the patch notes again. 7% to weakened foes. That 1.5k you took out of your ass means nothing, the patch may actually result in dps buff at the cost of endurance. For a class that's already at the top of raid benchmarks I'd say it's pretty good.
---
I'm going to sleep. I'm sure you'd direct me to more stats that prove my point but I won't bother. Replies off.
---
I've been seeing GW2 ads for years because I view GW2 content. This isn't anything new. I was looking at guitars for the past week and all I see now is ads for guitars. A lot of people don't know how targeted ads work.
---
And two projects that are so slow to come to market that the company you're a wholly owned subsidiary of cancels them to make you focus on the project people actually want to play.
---
The camera can't go fully vertical up or down. There's always a small angle indicating your direction. And that keeps you from being able to swim straight up, even in first person mode.  
---
I doubt there's any way to fix that, except requesting it to devs ad hoping they decide yo do it, and have time to do it.  
---
I highly recommend everyone to go to the Controls settings and check the Swim up and Swim down keys.  
---
If they have no keys bound to them, bind them. Underwater combat is **HORRID** without them.  
---
I recommend Space for Swim Up, and Right Shift for Swim Down.  
---
If you use swim up while swimming upwards, you'll go a tin bit faster than if you only swam upwards or used swim up alone.
---
Oh boy, if power berserker actually becomes a thing then I will be very mildly upset actually cause I can't use Incinerator as berserker.
---
Aiming manually takes just as long, and this means you can put the sword where the enemy is going, not where they currently are (same reason you shouldnt use snap aoes to target)
---
Everything seems fine ! Nice Work Anet Team !
---
They really ought list Break Bar type damage for all skills that apply and list value and duration like they do for boons and condis.
---
I would be happy enough if Junundu Wars got a "Choice chest" reward with nice options inside if all 6 wurms survived. 
---
I haven't found anyone doing that event for AGES.
---
I would say no because im used to free gw2 updates, but then I pay sub trash like ESO where you get 2 dungeons after 3 months and then 3 months of nothing and endless grind shit game fantasy 14 online
---
I am. :)
---
&gt; This change does very little from a functional perspective.
---
So explain Stavemaster Adryn's [Dimensional Blast](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/d/d4/Legendary_Stavemaster_Adryn_portal_attack.jpg). It can be destroyed via projectile destruction (e.g. Zealot's Defense, Winds of Disenchantment, etc. It can be reflected via projectile reflection (e.g. Feedback, Wall of Reflection, etc.) It can be blocked via normal block-over-time effects (e.g. Shield Stance). However, blocking it doesn't destroy it; blocking simply prevents the damage and pulls. So I don't understand how the removal of projectile destruction “does very little from a functional perspective.”
---
Scrappers still OP.  Bleh.
---
I think you could just run Kick/Bolas, and Outrage, leaving the third for a Signet still.
---
Will definitely have to play with it once it comes out, but theres a couple possibilities: if used instead of the Charged Mists trait, it allows you to use one of the other traits and have 75 energy for upkeep and weapon skills. So it would be an extra small packet of damage with Song of the Mists, or some extra crit chance from fury with Roiling Mists. Other possibility is to use it with Charged Mists, have 100 energy for each legend swap, and spam weapon skills more. It might even make it worth it to have an axe offhand weapon set in addition to the dual swords for some extra damage. Again, have to play with it, but it might not be bad.
---
Just to add to that. I get the same message on all my 5 accounts and, besides all of them having 2-way authentication, my network is already remembered. If you need any additional info, just say it.
---
Rip reduced range.
---
lol.
---
I think in some way hindsight is tricky for HoT.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
On first run, the HoT maps at launch were a slog because they tried something really innovative which didn't work very well. In your average MMO experience, GW2 vanilla included, you "progress" through the world itself by leveling to become strong enough to fight it out in more areas. This forms a path you can/should take in the world, though GW2 Vanilla has multiple of these they still exist. By choosing to keep the level cap at 80, Arenanet had to think of a way to still have some form of directed progression in HoT that wasn't level. They did so in masteries.
---
The key advantage to level-based gating is that if a player is either good+brave enough, or cooperative enough with the help of friends, they can break the progression at will and feel like they have some amount of control over their situation. They're \*guided\* as well, attacking a monster a couple levels too high is not the end of the world, but will be reliably more difficult for loot they normally can't use yet, and thus can \*choose\* to stick to their designed path(s), or...to not and take that harder road. Masteries don't really give this choice. Either you have the bullshit poison mastery, or you don't. You have the mushroom mastery, or you don't. There's no real choice, just a wall that says "you must be this tall to ride". MMOs are an exercise in fantasy, where you can engage your inner child at times, look right at that "this tall to ride" sign in front of the roller coaster, and set the damn thing on fire before strolling right past it. Wise perhaps no, but your decision. And a decision that video games can let you make at your own peril, since respawning is part of the experience rather than an end.
---
This is not to say HoT is, or was, bad. More that the progression design has a really key fault in its conceptual design. Now that we can look at HoT in retrospect, with the tweaks for new players to lessen those hard-walls and also with all the masteries on our accounts, HoT is a wonderful place to be. The maps are wonderfully three-dimensional, with the unlocked masteries allowing for deep map design and twisting paths that have multiple answers to traverse, interwoven and dense with content. This is a huge step up in map design on that level and is really fantastic. And this was designed this way to try and make sure every map had multiple run-throughs, where after you progressed through the map, you could go \*back\* through and have a different experience. But in retrospect, just means the maps have that many more options.  
---
PoF was made in the exact opposite method, because Anet learned the wrong lesson. PoF is sparse, because mounts are fast. If everything was close together why even bother mounting except to immediately dismount for the rabbit cc or w/e. But the maps were \*still\* made with hard-lines in mind, albeit less from the lack of density. There's still stuff around which just can't be done without having reached specific (mount) masteries. And if you get around that through brave, creative, or cooperative play, you are punished more heavily for it. The later mounts not being accessible even if you make it to their ranches if you don't have what Anet thinks you needed to get there, is that same stuff that made HoT feel really weird the first time around. It doesn't feel natural, nor does it feel empowering or reasonable. It feels like a wall saying you have to be taller to ride that coaster.
---
Personally, I generally find desert maps boring, and it's because designers tend to make them sparse anyway, as that's what a desert is "supposed" to feel like in our heads. Brown, flat-ish, more brown, empty. There's some space in PoF where we see some water &amp; oasis work, but not enough to make the overall expack feel multi-toned in a big way. Desert theme though makes them a really good fit when your springboard for design is largely based off mounts where vertically could break the space if meant to be a real hurdle (griffon/rabbit) or just go fast enough to make density a problem anyway (all sans rabbit).
---
tl;dr - I agree, HoT aged better than PoF, but would anyway perhaps without the changes, because we all have masteries now.
---
Great work.  I really like the artwork on the wyvern.  Looks like a badass Canadian Soul Beast on the prowl.
---
nice ramblings and strong fanboy-ing from you OP
---
so make a high risk huge investment decision for..what? the fundamentals of the game are amazing, it really doesn't need any sort of extreme overhaul
---
what's even the point to relaunch it when all the vague suggestions(more content yea great) could be built on the current iteration?
---
do we really need another wildstar? i believe not!
---
Can it auto-update and run  arcdps?
---
&gt;Magnetic Leap: This skill has been renamed Earthen Rush and reworked.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Earthen Rush: Quickly dash along the ground, summoning damaging spikes along the way and then delivering an area attack, immobilizing any enemy struck.
---
Uggghhh. RIP delicious long range jump that can avoid in combat movement? RIP some easy fractal skips, now I have to aim LH 2... :/.  
---
&gt;Evasive Arcana: The base healing value of this trait has been increased by approximately 20%.  
---
&gt;Arcane Abatement: Cleansing Wave: The base healing value of this trait has been increased by approximately 20%.
---
Lol. 
---
&gt;The weaver's sword is intended to be a single-target, high-DPS weapon that relies on direct hits to deal damage. In this update, we're leaning into the dagger's close-range area-of-effect damage and burst attacks. 
---
Lol. Close range damage. I guess that's a pretty cool idea for dagger, but I feel like more needs to change for "burst attacks" to every happen lmao.
---
&gt; Skills that destroy missiles will now block missiles instead. This change affects the following skills:  
---
&gt;Elementalist: Swirling Winds  
---
&gt;...  
---
Necromancer: Corrosive Poison Cloud
---
I think it was fine but now it's a bit funny a corrosive poison cloud that blocks. Lol.
---
&gt; This is a clear trade-off. In the case of elite specializations like druid, herald, chronomancer, berserker, or scrapper, this type of trade-off isn't possible because the specialization adds a completely new ability. With this update, we're targeting **a few** elite specializations to receive trade-offs, and we expect to **continue doing this in future updates**. 
---
Chrono is still base mesmer with an extra f5, Scrapper is still base engi with... uhhh, function gyro.
---
This means that either core mesmer is going to get something in the F5 slot (since the tradeoff for mirage is losing traditional dodge rolls, an extra core shatter would only make Chrono a tradeoff) down the line, or Chrono will lose something that core mesmer has. 
---
I can't really see what they'd add to base engi since Scrapper's "new stuff" is literally all passive though. New skill type, Function Gyro is just kinda *there*, and a new weapon type... not much that would "overwrite" a core engi thing and also not much they could take away while still leaving it a complete elite spec.
---
You look very cute! Are you there often?
---
Honestly I love the greatsword berserk right now... Sigh. I guess it's an interesting change but hey, it will be missed.
---
I think they may have brought it up so we at least know they are looking into it. Dont know why they didnt just say what they intended to do though.
---
And it's not like they have a problem with desolate subcategories on LFG, with *every living story map having its own section*.
---
The whole weapon needs its power coefficients doubled to be just okay in PvE
---
Exactly.

I'm playing with my friend that comes back to the game every 5 months and we get to this HP. I told him to be careful and that this HP was infamous. My super gear condition fireband clears the area and melts the HP and we move on but his comment of "that's not bad" bugged me a bit. Obviously, I'm carrying this berserk thief so when we were on our way out of the camp someone had attempted it on their own and their death corpse was chilling near HP (because who releases these days) so my friend runs to the rescue. I say watch the mobs around but he's scoffs at me and continues. I watch, quietly, as the hydra, blinding lions and that random forged pat murder his ass. Because friends let friends learn.
---
Lol I don't do raids because I don't like them. I find more challenge in T4/CM Fractals anyway.
---
Sword = sustained single target/cleave DPS
---
Dagger = bigger AoE burst damage
---
I recommend editing the post to put a space between numbered paragraphs. Its hard to see where point 1 ends and point 2 begins. It would improve readability.
---
I miss being called Boss honestly.
---
Eh I really liked Unity Glyph when dealing with trash mobs in fractals. Plus, there’s the free seed aftercast too. 
---
That being said, I’m glad it’s a regular utility now so it’ll definitely see more use in my case. Eager to see the true potential of the new elite glyph.
---
How long did it take für you till u finished?
---
Why'd you post this old ass news? Noooo Up Vote for yoooou BAD!
---
This is not going to be a popular opinion and I fully expect to be downvoted... but I'm not a fan of arbitrary changes like this that break more things than it fixes. This game's class design is a flawed system and will unfortunately be in "balance hell" until they completely redesign it.
---
Atleast it would be my choice!
---
Nah tho. The reason Fractals are so accessible is the easy numbers and anything-goes LFG, people are allowed to make mistakes, fumble the mechanics over and over until they click. In raids, if you fail to notice a mechanic you risk wiping the party or worse, downing only yourself while your party fights the boss for the next ten minutes, giving you no chance to re-try the mechanic. Training raids take HOURS where daily fractals on T1 take no more than one hour even with beginners. Any discussion of an easy mode in any game has to keep in mind the limitations on building reflexes for a failed mechanic, and if the downtime is more than a minute, it's hard to come away learning anything.
---
I used to run daily T4s as a boon/support chrono about 6 months ago, and I'm looking to get back into T4 fractals. I main a mesmer, and I currently have a light ascended armour set, with Berserker helm/shoulders/gloves/chest and Commanders boots/leggings, all with Leadership runes with Berserker/Commander trinkets and Berserker  weapons (with a concentration sigil). What is the easiest way to change my gear into something easy to use in PUGs -  I only play with PUGs and LFG, so I need to play something in high demand. I know boon chrono was pretty heavily nerfed, so is it still worth it to play boon chrono?  I could change to power chrono DPS instead, is that in demand? Or should I play mirage instead? I also have a level 80 guardian, but I don't yet have the ascended armour for T4 fractals on her yet. Sorry for all the questions, but I appreciate the help!
---
Approximately a 1.935% dps increase while using a 1h set. Not huge but should be worth a couple hundred dps.
---
These changes sound fantastic. Really well-designed. I run Daredevil exclusively in WvW and a 600 range unblockable steal makes so much more sense. Plus, now I don't have to chew an aegis first.
---
Berserker sounds like it'll be a blast to play.
---
ok but like f'real Orr was HoTv0.8 zombies everywhere and they ignore your safewords
---
Man, it's shocking how much better that format is
---
&gt;downing only yourself while your party fights
---
Have you ever been in a training run? Typical procedure is to /gg the group when someone dies because, like you said, the dead trainee will have no chance to practice while on his ass. Training runs aren't for getting kills, so wiping a run that *could* scrape its way to a kill isn't a problem.
---
T1 fractals don't give you the skills to play 99/100cm or even basic t4s. If you exclusively practice at t1 in fractals, that practice is ultimately worthless in t4 because things you could safely ignore/fail suddenly become lethal. Raids are content balanced at the level of the CM fractals, so any sort of practice mode *can't* just be an easy mode if it's going to provide any meaningful practice.
---
Is there a good WvW condo scourge build out there?
---
Ok.
---
I'm a filthy pve casual, I just want Scrapper to be welcome in literally any endgame pve content. I'm glad they're giving Scrapper some attention, but Idk if this is going to make people start running power Scrapper or anything.
---
Like I said, power damage is 15% of your damage as FB. Losing 11% crit is more of a dps loss than gaining 80 power and 8 condi damage is a gain. That's why you care about crit chance as condi Firebrand.
---
&gt;"any sort of practice mode can't just be an easy mode if it's going to provide any meaningful practice."
---
Your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that death is the only consequence that actually teaches mechanics. I disagree.
---
Right, dodges. However if you are using dodges to avoid damage, is one a dps loss and two, the class is no longer that easy to play. Yes you die if you stand in one spot and press one even with 100+ essence groups with quickbrand and renegades. I know because I had the unfortunate experience of playing with DDs who does exactly this. Don't try to exaggerate. Sure reaper shroud is an issue with healing/scholar but guess what. Locust swarm heal in shroud next patch and we are likely to swap to thief runes. 
---
As for power reaper buffs, I don't really understand your point here. The biggest issue by far at the first iterations with power reaper has been with it's rotation. Namely there was 0 reason to use gs3 other than life force. There was 0 reason to go in reaper shroud which is your main mechanic. That and gs54 was a combo which barely provided a damage increase which resulted in one of the most boring rotations. I wrote probably at least 3 thread on this. So of course they should buff the parts that are weak instead of focusing on the strong part of the rotation. Because if all they are targeting GS1 and 2, then we are going to end up with the same snoozefest of a playstyle even if the numbers are right. I doubt many people want that.
---
Sure, but power reaper has boon corrupt, aoe blind and innate tankiness which again I argue has much greater value than most people realize. Now I would never say DH is worse than reaper, because it is better. However the damage between the two is simply not large enough for this to be an issue. Also why didn't you talk about holo? Isn't it because power holosmith is a pretty decent class but the gap is simply not there for you to talk about?
---
My virus scanner and firewall flipped out at it since it doesn't have a digital signature. Odd.
---
I'm going to say what I normally rant in discords. Just because wing one is the first wing does not make it the best for teaching. I'd argue in a lot of cases it's one of the worst bar the obvious wing 5 example. 
---
Just to vacuum, the following text is based on not having a group full of trainee's but maybe 1-3 4 tops.
---
Vale guardian is a great example of my hundreds of rants that my discord buddies wish I'd shut up about for the following reason. It is awful to teach. Greens if actually doing the mechanic and not out healing separates people. You end up with several people just range auto attacking a boss.  If you wipe in stage 5 you now have to spend the 30 seconds running back for them who don't have the rift to shave a few seconds.  You end up spending 3-5 mins in average groups just getting there due to how long VG itself takes to phase not including the 3 "HERES HOW TO FIGHT HIS SIDE FORMS". VG itself is a loooot of time taken up.   I'm not going to get into spirit run because  it's still a slog just to get to another several minute run that's super hard to fail and until it gave an LI just sucked to do.
---
My perspective is w4 is initiate a better training wing.    Cairn sucks but it teachs the principal sticking with group, yes it has  the 2 main VG mechanics, but it never punishes you away from a group and veterans can nuke him hard due to being a single phase fight.  Mursaat is also a very simple  you might have to dodge fight with very basic roles.  The first two fights of w4 are basically dps golems. Easy to give them that sweet victory tase. Now we go to ye olde Samarog. The  yeet mister, the i'm cutting you up into sushi, go hug a friend".  Introduces further  easy to understand mechanics that vets can do without new players being impacted by"idk whats going on, oh, if im green go to a friend sure np".
---
The disconnect from w1 being overall a not bad time to w2 being"Hello I am sloth, i don't need a title I may still have the title for most player kills as a raid boss", was quite large.     Keep construct is another great simple one that teaches harder mechanics for those ready to learn.   I feel overall we do a massive diservice by"I WANT TO DO IT, LIKE I DID IN  insert game here, WITH  PROPER PROGRESSION".  Sure just don't go into w5 first. Amgal isnt really that hard to  learn since it boils down to roughly 2 or 4 people doing the mechanic and its just a dps and cleave with minor CC fight.   Most power damage generic fights are less punishing to learn than w1 is what i'm trying to say from my personal history of training.
---
You don't have a pet to tank for you or res or do anything else
---
druid
---
Tempest has always been used as a pure healer, so not sure what you are getting at. It's very common to see it on some of the more heal intensive raid bosses, and has been for years. 
---
But druid isnt the support meta, and hasn't been for a while now. And with this upcoming patch, rev will be the far superior support class, without many viable alternatives.
---
Then they can address that in future balance updates.
---
Meanwhile, did you see what's happening to Berserker?
---
&gt; , but for someone wanting more out of the maps, a larger map-wide effort to keep them engaged,
---
We have that on some of the PoF maps and nobody does those metas.

I loved last repeater change. Use pistol + dagger and spam it. The only issue I had was that you spent too much initiative too quickly. They seem to want to address it so... Yay!
---
I feel like your drawings are improving.
---
No idea why they felt the need for more druid nerf AND more support rev buffs?? We've had actual build and come diversity these past few months and now that'll all be gone and we'll be back to having a rigid group comp. Speaking of which, it's crazy how much attention warrior is getting, even though it has a guaranteed spot in every 5 and 10 man group. Not that there is anything wrong with warrior having multiple viable options, but let's at least make all the classes usuable and desirable in group content before giving the one single essential class more options to run.
---
15% crit to skills 1-3 while using a 1h
---
vs.
---
4% crit to everything and ~2% power damage when using a 1h
---
Pretty close in overall output depending on where your damage was coming from.
---
Oh I see! It's been such a long time since I tried p/d that I forgot about that. Still pretty cool to see it working better.
---
For daze, stun, and knockdown (any hard cc with a duration), the breakbar damage scales directly with duration (1s = 100 damage, 2s = 200, etc). Exception is certain things like the 0.25s daze on Headshot, which does 100 damage to ensure it's not pointless as an "interrupt" on enemies with breakbars. For stuff without a duration, like launch or pulls, it's a little inconsistent as to how much damage they do.
---
Rev was designed alongside herald with HoT.
---
It was the only one that never existed as a core-only profession.  I'd imagine that they built it around the assumption that you'd always have an elite spec equipped.
---
Alrighty, that makes sense.  Ty for explaining :D.

First off know that they just announced a new [balance patch for the 23rd](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/74076/balance-changes-upcoming). Chrono's utility and boon output was nerfed but the trade off was that you can focus more on damage now with the new diviner gear set. Here is [dT's optimized damage build](https://discretize.eu/builds/mesmer/hybrid-chronomancer), [snowcrow's raid support build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/support/), and [metabattle's fractal chrono build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Chronomancer_-_Utility_Boon_Support_\(Fractal\)) just for comparison. Note that you'll be expecting a free 15% boon duration from running potions and having 150 AR which SC doesn't take into account along with having low boon duration since there is a second chrono in 10 man content. So it depends on how much effort you want to put into swapping gear over and what boon duration you're aiming for. For pug groups I'd suggest trying to go for higher boon duration and capping out at 100% (after taking into account food/utility, 15% from potion, runes, sigil, etc). So I would need to know what your exact trinket setup is but I'll assume you have mostly commander with only 2 berserker that you can swap out for [something like this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQNAs+cnsIClfi9fCGoBUrhlVjqeZj2ptcDGhAAdLOjqA-jRSfQBPSFmPpsiQ7PkQlKb6BA4kTCArUCCA9CcQ9BSBs7wN-e). The rings can be bought from [season 4 episode 2](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ethall) or some of the [all stat options in this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character).
---
As for your other questions, chronos especially in pugs are in high demand. An organised good group can run power firebrand + power renegade to have alacrity and quickness while getting better overall dps but again, it's not see often in pugs since it needs two specialized roles done well. Power DPS chrono is pretty good though you might get confused as boon and there are better DPS options. Mirage is not as good as power chrono in fractals since you want high power damage burst not sustained condition damage. Power DPS dragonhunter and hybrid firebrand are both great builds for fractals if you decide to switch later.
---
What is the benefit in selecting which authentication server you connect through?
---
The pre events in AB are for keys. Still worth doing.
---
It's almost as if they used their braincells to ask the community and find out that way...
---
Is is too much just to ask for a story mode?  I think that would skip a lot of the Git Gud Bullshit and the geargrind for a 5% boost to stats. 
---
I don't even care about the rewards, I just don't have the time to ~~herd a bunch of cats~~ rely on a raid group's worth of people in order to see a large fraction of the recent content.

---
I'm excited to start missing my spirit hammer stuns
---
It's been a while since we've had that, actually. It's kind of upsetting me.
---
yeah d912pxy is even better than installing dx9, but I see a lot of people having trouble setting it up or dont want to use 3-party programs.
---
I don't talk holo because holo's point is the massive amount of CC and burst it brings. Reaper fails against those 2.
---
Guardian also brings aoe blind, btw.
---
Doding is as much a DPS loss for daredevil as it is for any other class, and even on reaper if you're not dodging artsariv stomp/MAMA jumps/ensolyss stomps/siax cones/summon circles orany other CM boss's orange you are either dying or getting CC'd off which is a DPS loss anyways.
---
And buffing GS1&amp;2 does not compete with the other skills so long as they have greater damage of activation per cast. Greatsword in general does atrocious damage and needs buffing, that simple.
---
That, between that and dodging you can avoid combat at most every node
---
Could just cut the cooldown of the function gyro in half, but make them unable to revive or stomp normally.
---
I imagine instakill moves (Warbanner/Thief elite) would still work.
---
You also can push downed enemy away from the druid.
---
me irl
---
I don't think that an "easy mode" would solve that problem. I also think that the problem you're describing is covered in the OP:
---
When a new raid wing comes out, everyone is fresh on it and experiences it together. They go through an encounter by trial and error to figure out any mechanics that aren't obvious and adapt to them as quickly as they can. W6 was the first raid wing I was active for when it was brand new and I got to experience that first hand.
---
However, if you're just jumping into raids now you might feel like you're the only one who doesn't understand what's going on and that might be holding back the group. You want to be able to experience and learn some of the mechanics without being a burden to the rest of the squad, right?
---
&gt;4\. **Players have anxiety about being a burden on a group, and believe they are not "good enough" to join raids.**
---
Sometimes the only way you're going to learn a mechanic is to just jump in and try it. In a setting like the AB meta, it's not as intimidating because you can just hop into a larger group of people and try to go through the motions until it clicks, but a raid is a much more intimate encounter by design and you are much more accountable.
---
Granted there are a few encounters that are much less forgiving and thus make it harder to make progress to different phases to learn those mechanics. If you join a Dhuum training group and never make it out of prephase because of failed greens or being blown up by other players, then you personally might not be learning anything in those runs because you haven't had a chance to experience the mechanics in the fight you're going to be dealing with.
---
The last thing I want to say is that I think it's difficult to assess what would work well for an "Easy Mode" without subverting the encounter, especially from the perspective of someone who hasn't gotten in to try the raids yet. In that case, maybe more of an incentive to get people in for the first time would help encourage getting past that hurdle?
---
&gt; The best example of truly engaging content the Silverwastes. 
---
Not this shit again
---
The timezone thing is what I struggle with too, I was able to pug my way to t4 fractals playing at 3 am server time but have only been able to do a few training raids with the single small guild I found that does them sometimes at a time other than 8pm server time on wednesdays
---
Care to explain?
---
To be fair, might stacking on 10 people is still a fairly exclusive club. Only a handful of classes can even give might to 10 at all, and the ones that do struggle immensely to maintain 25 stacks on all 10 without SoI support which is either reduced or outright absent in Firebrand/Renegade comps (depending on 1 or 0 Chronos).
---
You can piece together 25 might on 10 across multiple classes, but that requires a lot of overall game knowledge while being extremely hard to LFG for. Not really practical outside full statics in my opinion.
---
I could be wrong, but I don't see Druid going anywhere for the majority of the playerbase until ANet gives us more plug-and-play might options.
---
I just hate 10 man content in a game that was designed for 5. Herding cats it's the least fun videogame mechanic in history.  Just give me raids balanced for 5.
---
&gt;  if the downtime is more than a minute, it's hard to come away learning anything.
---
Good game design, especially for 'difficult' content, follows Fail Faster.   
---
It follows design that punishment is intended to alert the player to incorrect behavior. If the punishment is too severe, the game doesn't teach the mechanic effectively.
---
He does really great work :)
---
Every class is crying evenly, looks like promising balance patch :-P
---
Not sure why this got downvoted, gave me a good chuckle :)
---
I dont know why an Elite spec needs a "trade-off" when picked. This balance patch is ridiculous.
---
I want to become a risen
---
Not against it, but its good to not see it in every outfit/armour they release.
---
&gt; the visual appeal of wanting personal art
---
Is this seriously not good enough for you?
---
Daredevil receives extra dodge charges. Reducing the range on steal to swipe to make it unblockable actually creates something more flavourful than not. You're daringly going out to mug someone instead of from range. You want to gap close? Then maybe you have to burn some initiative or some additional movement ie: a dodge charge to bring you into swipe range.
---
Let's do that instead of a new valuable expansion and Ascalon pre-Searing and I will meet again right after.

---
Hear hear, that was a very thorough post! Honestly I didn't realise people still called for easy mode raids, but if they do, after this, they shouldn't.
---
Holo burst is definitely higher than Reaper but the CC is very much comparable. Regardless again the point is that the difference barely matters. Yes Guardian has a blind but I think I already made my point about guardians.
---
I mentioned about dodging because it brings up 2 points. One is that while DD rotation is simple, playing it in a dangerous environment is not. Getting punished while missing a dodge is much worse as a DD than other classes. As a Reaper you can tank many of those mechanics and in fact part of minmaxing is knowing how much you can tank while squeezing out damage while others have to back off.
---
The issue with buffing GS1 and 2 is not an issue no. However you original point was that the past reaper buffs were not on point when they absolutely were. I mentioned the reason why they cannot buff JUST GS 1 and 2 in my previous post so please refer to it.
---
Lastly I really have to say, you do realize soul eater is an universal modifier correct. That means is a buff to greatsword as well. Yes I know is not 10% considering there will probably be rune changes and assassin pieces, but is likely to be a buff. We are not in some universe where greatsword is not used in the rotation at all, in fact it is a very important part of the rotation so I am not understanding where is this great urgency to buffing greatsword. We originally wanted shroud buffs because it was literally not used in the rotation, at all. We don't need just GS buffs because currently is used in the rotation. Simple modifier is fine. If there is ever a day where GS is just not used like warrior GS then sure, I can see your point. But that is definitely not the case.
---
I mean like 50%? or more? are all story related, just from Living World Season 1, which is more in the future, but still absolutely tied to the story just like the dungeons. And only story mode is tied to actual story, the rest is just as grindy as fractals. Rewards are handled different i'll grant yoi but the rest not so much :/
---
I'm sure there's a very strong chance that there's a lewd version of this floating around
---
What screen shots did you send him? Just curious to see what he worked with vs what he created.
---
op is making a lot of far-fetched assumption about what casual players will and won't do, to the point where it's a bit condescending. His reasons for fewer mechanics story mode is that it not an adequate introduction to "REAL RAIDING", which is bonker because the whole point is of the story mode suggestion is to be something for casual players to enjoy INSTEAD of normal node, not as a "training instance".
---
This is cool, but I feel like if the original was created as a .png instead of a .jpg, the quality would be slightly better.
---
Well written.
---
Nobody is talking about? This is main complain about PoF events, you just used more letters to say the same.
---
I don't know. I am extremely excited, because this unblockable daze will be worth gold (especially looking at you, Full Counter)...but I am just a WvW roamer, I don't know/care about sPvP.
---
assuming (and it's a shaky assumption) that at some point these skins will be buyable, I'd take a free two-hander if it were something that I used.
---
Stopped reading at the vale guardian damage part to give some input: your training group seemed to be somewhat experienced as well. I joined training groups for vale guardian twice so far. The first time was a wiping fest and we focused on surviving first of all. Managed to kill it after a few attempts. But even in the second group where no one died, we hit the enrage timer 2 times before finally succeding the third run.
---
I think skilled people don't have the slightest idea of how large the skill gap between a casual and a pro is.
---
Well H.O.P.E. Is the best legendary. With the pew pew and stuff.
---
Nobody pinpoints what's wrong about the events. "PoF needs better rewards" and "PoF has metas, just increase the rewards to make them worth doing" are the common points players make, but both miss the larger problem.  
---
With better meta rewards, players will only do the few metas which make up a small portion of the map. With better rewards in general, the standard events are designed in a way that leads to a tedious playstyle.  
---
And nobody is talking about that.  
---
They say "New maps need meta events"  
---
Great, now we have 1 event that players will visit every few hours, while the rest of the map is dead.  
---
See what I'm getting at here?  
---
It is the structure of the events. The the flow, the direction, that needs to be addressed. And I don't see anyone talking about this.

---
I agree that Easy Mode is kind of a cop-out. I love the solutions you've proposed, and they actually got me thinking - particularly #2 and #3. 
---
So, I've been playing a lot of Hollow Knight lately, and the past DLC for it was a take on the "Boss rush" mode -- no particular spoilers, you fight predetermined groups of 10 bosses in a row, and unlock the next tier -- until finally, you're thrown into the final gauntlet, which is a battle against every boss in the game (some with reworks) until you reach the final boss's final form.
---
This mode also added a "Boss hall" feature, where you could go and practice specific bosses to git gud, with 3 scales of difficulty. There's very little reward for beating the T3 of a boss, but it allows you to try your luck at a specific boss without any of the leadup. 
---
I'd rather like to see an implementation of something like this training mode -- having players do content they could be getting a reward for, but aren't, is normally a hard ask, but i kind of imagine it as a pre-game tool built into the Special Forces training area to assist with explaining the boss mechanics.
---
The way I kind of see it is uhm, an arena with an observation deck and a control panel. From the observation deck, you can watch the patterns of the boss, and on the panel you can force phasing by setting the boss's HP%. You could head down to the ground level to demonstrate how the tank is going to position, where everyone else should, how to respond to mechanics, etc. And, from the control panel, you can modify the damage scaling of the boss attacks - either massively reduce them so people can understand how the fight will flow, or set them so anyone who gets hit by a Seeker or a Portal in Vale Guardian is instagibbed -- just to build the association that you should never, ever touch those.
---
So what does this update means for core specs?
---
I loved my attunement-dancing dagger Ele back in the day, but I've heard it's been mostly dead for some time.
---
In theory you are right. Problem is that you need the content to "train". If - and that's a big if - IF Anet would release ~ 12 new dungeons each year your described form of progress would work. They don't.
---
People did dungeons back in 2012-2013. They made slight progress, maybe started to switch their fullsoldier equip to berserk. After they were finished with dungeons/got bored they returned to story/open world. And switched their equip back to soldiers. They forgot what their learned.
---
Fractals got a similar problem: same rewards, similar design, 2012 content. People do a new fractal a couple of times. Not often enough to become better players. There is simply not enough instanced teamcontent to improve, if you aren't willing to repeat the same content hundreds of times.
---
Open world/story is very different designed. You don't play in a team there, your build doesn't matter that much. If you run fullnomand at tequatl it might be a better experience (less deaths) than in fullzerk. 
---
GW2 is very slow at adding new content. And especially instanced teamcontent is severly lacking. Many players, guilds and communities complain since ~ release about a lack of content to play together. Open world is fine as it is. But there is not enough instanced teamcontent. Dungeons are abandoned. And there is ~ 1-2 new fractals each year. So roughly 50% of all new instanced content is raids. That's bad design, too.
---
Usually "hardcore content" is a small percentage, like 5-10%. Ideally there would be 10 new dungeons for each new raid. This would be a good stepping stone into raids. Players could do this easy content, slowly become better without getting bored to death - and then are maybe able to do some easier raids. 
---
If players are doing a new 15 min fractal 5 times and then play only open world for a year they won't get "trained", they won't progress. They have forgotten everything a year later.
---
It boils down to: GW2 is an extremly casual singleplayer open world game. Which is needed, because many players actually want that. GW2 also has a hardcore teamplayer niche with raids. Now good luck getting new players into raids when your recruiting pool isn't guild- or teamplayers, but "open world only" players. More casual teamcontent than raids is severly lacking. Players which are interested in such content left GW2. There is nothing to do for them in GW2 - and in consequence they can't be recruited for raids.
---
Maybe I'm totally missing the point, but Dragon's Claw doesn't pierce currently. Adding piercing increases both AoE (hits more enemies) and burst (more damage going out because you are hitting more enemies) while the short range aspect is retained.
---
I totally get that it might not be a big amazing buff that all elementalists want, but Anet are pretty much doing as stated.
---
1. Install MSI afterburner, post screenshot of the system usage (processor, ram, gpu, vram) after you ran gw2 with it for several minutes.
---
2. What resolution are you running?
---
3. Is it full screen/windowed?
---
4. Is the game client completely downloaded and NOT streaming in the background?
---
Depending on your answer, there are a lot of things that could be wrong here, but your performance shouldn't be that low with that setting.
---
While you are right about boss mechanics, you are wrong about game mechanics. In fractals players learn how to play their own class. An experienced fractal player won't show up with his staff-soldier-fullsignet guardian as "dps class" for raids. That's something you learn in fractals. For experienced fractal runners or dungeonspeedrunners it was/is a lot easier to get into raids. You can focus on the boss and don't need to read skill descriptions mid combat.
---
Incentives are definitely something the game needs to work on. Players will literally do anything if it is rewarding.  Heck, in a game like RuneScape players literally just sit back and watch their character repeat the same action for thousands of hours because it's rewarding.  
---
But at the same time, how enjoyable content is plays some part in it as well. Players are willing to take a loss if something is enjoyable to them. It's the reason not every player in the game is running the most profitable content 100% of the time.  
---
My hope is that that maybe even if the content isn't the most rewarding in the game, players will still find it worth doing if it is made more enjoyable. Because currently, I don't think many people enjoy repeating hearts or dynamic events in their current form.

I've recently came back to the game after a 2 year hiatus. I've never been on top of the meta, but is there an engineer build that deals decent damage without using more then 1 weapon kits? Are turrets viable at all?
---
&gt;, static groups prefer to do every wings in one go, taking about 3 hours or so?
---
Well, this is mmo, after all. What do you expect to get out of, not being able to have 3 free hours once a week? How low can our standarts go in 2019?
---
congratz, your whole post made no single argument about why we would not need an easymode :)
---
As i said imao commiting to a legendary should be a commitment and not an investment you can always just dump and buy the new version.
---
My training group had three experienced players, two on healers and one on off-chrono. We also had someone playing full magi Renegade, a world vs world minstrel Firebrand tanking, etc. I'm not linking the log because I don't want to embarrass any of the players involved. With voice commands calling out the teleport circles, we eventually got it with all players standing up.
---
Honestly, I think sidestepping mechanics punishes inventiveness. In GW1, lifesteal ignored shields and invulnerability because that was part of its definition, and using it in situations that bypassed those defenses wasn't considered cheesing. If a boss throws out a ton of projectiles, reflection SHOULD be the go-to counterplay. A long windup should encourage an interrupt. Turning an enemy into an HP sponge/lump of iron with no counters - so you're forced to sit through its 10 minutes of attacks - does not make for fun encounters.
---
so necro wells work underwater, gyros aka wells now also work underwater... why the fuck are my chrono wells not working underwater still?!
---
Especially in training, properly geared off-meta builds are more than welcome. Off-healers especially being a *ton* more to a group than a second Druid.
---
how exactly is 10man different from 5man?
---
kinda the cart before the horse here ;D
---
I do see why they are "subpar" on end-game content but even when I played with my heal guardian people kept telling me to go meta, even though my character was fully spec as a support/buffer. (Dragonhunter wasn't a thing when this happened, was pre-HOT).
---
And no, I dont pick a weapon because its "cool", I pick it because I like the skillset it provides to me. I'm usually a tank player or more off-support/cc oriented player, picking those weapons that provide me with defensive tools and so on benefits my playstyle. A truly offensive weapon such as the sword or the scepter won't benefit me at all like the Hammer or Mace does.
---
I don't let others "finish the job" on Open World events, I do my best and help when required, my hammer saved many lives, even those who complained to me in dungeons were saved by its movement-restraining skill.
---
So no, the main problem is that more than half of the playerbase is too reliant on the meta builds on whatever webpage they refer to (my experience, even in "for fun" or "casual" groups). I do understand that some groups just want to be effective (while others want to turn the game into a job), but I'm here to have fun, and using a weapon and skills that I don't find fun would mean me not having fun at all, thankfully im fine with using all skills (that aren't engineer's bomb/nade kit).
---
Why give the players choices in weapons if we're not able to take them with us when we require them? Each player plays the game differently. I think the "meta" of this game should be more open but ANet keeps making DPS-reliant content, hurting anyone who doesn't want to go DPS or full-spec healer, and anything that's not meta people complain about.
---
This is my experience, and it has been hurt a lot of times due to those people, I never did a raid a single time, due to my already bad experience in open world and dungeons. Maybe the situation changed now, I do not know. I've recently come back to the game and I'm just enjoying it on the open without hurting anyone else's experience.
---
I am a bit sad about soul eater. I took it in pvp for the reduced greatsword recharge, and extra life force and healing while kiting.
---
Decimate defences already was a a dps trait, I don't think it needed changing into a dps trait. I liked that there was different options.
---
5% life steal is much worse than what it was before. Now you have to be doing damage to get healing and the amount of healing will be lower. You get 250 healing on doing 5k damage for example. In spvp you probably aren't doing 5k damage every sec so healing will be lower.
---
Its bugs me you go into huge wall of text and never touch on one of the main reasons a lot of us avoid raids: The time commitment.  I've raided in every MMO I've played and the biggest hurdle to raiding is managing players which is a nightmare. That is why fractals is so immensely popular. Its much easier to organize and handle 5 players than 10.
---
I see the point he has. It's totally arbitrary which builds are allowed to buff a *squad* versus a subsquad (even on the same build it's awkward, look at Druid with ten man spirits and might but only a couple sources of ten man Fury and five man Spotter). Healing Renegade can do most things a druid can (healing, CC, unique damage buff) but its might is limited to five people.
---
Time commitment *is* an inherent issue with raids, but is somewhat overstated. You don't have to clear a full wing in one sitting, and you can just kill one boss and come back to another boss later in the week. Remember that raid reset is once per *week* not once per *day* like five man content. 
---
Raids being ten man allows for a much more interesting design space. For example, at Slothasor you will require four separate players to learn and execute the "become a slubling and eat the mushrooms" mechanic. Ten man compositions also allows for tighter flexibility in team skill: a fractal group with two support players and a banners means there's a lot of pressure on the two full DPS players to perform *perfectly* while having a very good player in a semi-exp raid group can cover well for multiple not-great players.
---
&gt; ...bonker because the whole point of the story mode suggestion is  for it to be something casual players can enjoy INSTEAD of normal mode.
---
That is exactly OPs point. Adding an easy mode wouldn't grow the raiding community and rather cut the flow of new players.
---
&gt; I don't let others "finish the job" on Open World events, I do my best and help when required, my hammer saved many lives, even those who complained to me in dungeons were saved by its movement-restraining skill.  
---
that is highly subjective. from your standpoint of view, you helped a lot.  
---
i had it many times when i trained people back in the dungeon days or even when the raid came out, that i told them that their playstyle is not benefical and they do not add much to the group. didn't say this in a harsh way, but some even raged at me for this, hurt feelings and so. but half a year later they came to me and said: holy shit, you where right and now i can see what you meant.  
---
in the end, you shouldn't be blinded by the words meta and hate it. try new stuff, don't be too focused to totally play off meta and so one.  
---
maybe you will experience the game in a new way.  
---
just to pump out one example: bomb kit is a really strong engi kit. you could have saved lifes in a dungeon or at any content at a veteran / elite mob just by putting down a blind field which disables literally any hardcore hitting foe into a not damaging white critter for the duration. also the CC from the f-skill is really hard and breaks blue bars like nothing.  
---
once in a while, its good to play outside of your safe space, just to get new experience.
---
&gt; asy mode EVERYTHING is what killed WOW for millions of us.
---
I know you're trying to make a point but you're wrong. LFR is one of the biggest and best additions WoW ever did. It got so many people into raiding and made all that content accessible. Just because *you* didn't like it doesn't mean millions of others also didn't.
---
If you were on NA, I'd personally schedule a raid training around your schedule but alas, you're EU. No idea why anet insists on splitting the two communities.
---
That said, I'm sure if you asked on crossroads inn / RTI for someone to host a training at a specific time, a trainer would volunteer to do so.
---
Let's say we get a season 5 which has 'expansion like content'.
---
If the season itself is free, which means not locked behind an expansion, there might be 'extras' which 
---
* A Season 5 preparation package (with character slot and bag expansions,  level 80 tickets or a total makeover kit and maybe an unique outfit)
---
* Access to a lounge (like the Lily of the Elon)
---
* Access to a new player race, or, at least, cosmetic options like all the elonian options that came with PoF
---
Additionaly, I can think of something that gives no real advantage to the player himself, but to many - like the commander tags for example. Maybe a multi-passanger mount, or access to ships / airships within the new maps that function like home instances etc.
---
It would not be your choice, because half the player base using the feature would complain to ArenaNet that it should load faster REGARDLESS of the amount of decorations.
---
Your right on useless traits, there are quite a few of them.
---
There are also a number of utility skills that will just never see use so long as other options exist, a perfect example being hollowed ground &amp; stand your ground (the later is just always better so the former really needs to do something different)
---
As far as sword main hand goes however the problem is that FB axe not only scales better with physical damage but the pull is more often then not better then a teleport as it brings them to you and your friends.
---
Its nice to see them making hammer &amp; mace faster though (granted they didn't go far enough. They could literally take 1 pulse off of the hammer's symbol then speed it up grately to make it feel allot better)
---
Yes but now generic ranger pays the price with all the previous pet nerfs that weren't druid-only.
---
If Anet would put half as much effort into additional raid modi than people put effort into posts telling other people that additional modi won't change anything (they would), we would've three difficulties and a story mode so even the single dad can check it out between his kid sleeping and him having an hour to himself.
---
You need to do the portal before that zone, so if you need brisban you have to do the iron marches portal. You can read[ Dulfy's guide on it](http://dulfy.net/2019/04/09/gw2-helpful-hero-current-events-and-riftstalker-weapons-guide/) or check [the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Helpful_Hero) for the current time and location.
---
Don't worry, i am happyily raiding 4 times a week with my guild, i wrote this from my observations.
---
Communication is the intended way to do raids, not necessarily the easy mode. It is content designed for dedicated guild groups, but the way the game evolved the public view of raids comes from the lfg.
---
Make this a thing but with the sound effects of a heavily glitched Bowser
---
But then the game would be flooded by legendary skins which defeats the purpose of having the skin
---
No, roleplaying is using *any* build you enjoy, regardless of how good it is. It could be meta banner warrior, it could be double longbow core ranger; if the *only* reason you play it is because you like it, that's roleplaying.
---
Something like dungeons we have now,but y'know. More epic
---
What did OP mean by this?
---
I've had a few commissions done, one physical and a couple of digital. For me, aside from being a cool artwork in a style I enjoy looking at, it captures the spirit of my character better than a screenshot so even if I'm not playing the game I can still have a connection to it. I use them as wallpaper on my PC, or a screen unlock pic on my tablet.
---
It would be the guild leader(s) choice. The majority of people aren’t that high in their guilds so most people wouldn’t have a choice in the matter
---
For me, as a non-raider who missed the boat when raiding was introduced, a *lot* would be fixed by having an interface category or filter for raid LFGs that are "no requirements, no bar to entry".
---
I know you can *write* this in your description but that's just not good enough; the LFG tool could really do with some more love.
---
I know these groups will just wipe. It doesn't matter to me. I've literally never *stepped into a raid instance* because I feel like I'm going to be ruining other peoples' fun, and I don't want to join a guild and have to meet at a certain time a week just to try the content.
---
Fractals don't have this problem not *just* because of the difficulty scaling - it's because they're short, so groups are frequent, and very often there are groups that post "no reqs" or similar where they're just playing for fun, and don't really care if things go badly. Raids are longer so in my experience this doesn't happen as much.
---
Last time I created my own group, with it written in the title that it was "no reqs, for fun", I waited over an hour at peak time, and couldn't fill the group.
---
I think if the LFG had better support and filtering, you might see a bit more of this. It would also benefit the core raiding community by keeping new people who don't know better out of their groups.
---
Regarding "Again, digital commissioned artwork, it's of a different age without needing Oil &amp; Water based paints or Char Coal to create illusion on a flat surface."  
---
It's exactly the same familia, it's still a 2D surface where your trying to create a 3D image. It's no different to traditional media and many people find digital more appealing than traditional. So in other words, same shit as trad.
---
Chrono is on the lower end but yea, not quite healer level. But quite a bit below the BS,in my experience. Power quickbrand essentially just sacrifices DH skills and traits (the boon skills are all 0 cast time excrpt feel my wrath) so it still keeps up fairly good damage, similar to BS.
---
Most of utility skills won't be used as long as meditations exist. Meditation trait makes them too OP compared to other skills: healing, AoE fury, physical damage, burning and condition cleanse in 1 skill. If you don't play support then meditations are the way to go no matter if you want to deal physical or condition damage. 
---
I would like to see some changes to traits which improve skill types for guardian. Slight nerfs to meditation trait. Changes to spririt weapon trait since only sword benefits from burning. And buffs to consecration &amp; shout traits. 
---
[Smither's Boon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Smiter%27s_Boon) Could also be completly reworked to tune down meditation and introduce some variety. It's quite OP.
---
Easy mode in fractals work imo. And there is reason why. I can play through mechanics and learn on the go. I absolutely despise that you basically have to watch fight/read about it several times before even attempt. I want to game, not watch and read :/
---
Its fantastic that you can in Observatory fractal explode on everyones head and make a mental note - oke, dont do that again. That would mean wipe in t4.
---
You didn't get what i'm saying. If you account bound you unlock the skin for your pgs, if you don't account bound you don't get the skin. You couldn't sell the skin, obv
---
No but you’re saying that I can give my friends my legendary weapon and they can give theirs to me and suddenly I’ve got a heap of legendary skins that I did nothing to deserve - which defeats the purpose of having **legendary** skins
---
Happy cake day
---
\&gt;pronounced as fuck abs

\&gt;thuft of hair coming over belt
---
Most subtlest drawing around here since that pic of Aurene branding an eggplant with her breath.
---
I only cross them out once people confirm in-person! A person did confirm Warrior in person, though, so it's taken :\\
---
Anyone has a link to an image or video in which I can clearly see how the yellow outline around the screen looks like when one stands on the blue teleport circles during Vale Guardian fight?
---
ANet have expressed their regret about Gen1 being tradeable. It was likely a push by people from monetization.
---
It's never too late to fix that problem.  
---
They should give a 3 month warning with regular reminders, then make any new crafted gen1 account bound on craft, while keeping old ones tradeable for another year, then after that year cancel all trade offers and make the remaining ones account bound too.
---
Yes
---
OP doesn't understand how much extra damage that is against smaller groups like 3 enemies close together in PvP.
---
What ? Another legendary *Short bow* ? Where is the promised greatsword !
---
I can't vouch for any other region, but in NA you can play at basically any time of the day or night and almost basically every single map will have enough people around to do the highest level events. Sometimes even at really off-peak hours there will be enough people on some of the more popular maps to have multiple instances of them.
---
No.
---
Maybe.
---
Would it be better to delete my Ranger or grind 300g to get enough gems to buy a character slot?  
---
I don't really play on my Ranger at all anymore, but it's the first character I created and got to lvl80 with so he has a bit of sentimental value to him. But I'm really lazy to farm gold and don't know the best spots, so advice on that would be appreciated anyway.
---
Cheers!
---
like you can be done with HoT metas in one hour and you have nothing to do in PvE except t4 fractals, witch is like 35 min run. And then you left to do Palawadan and SW. Do not see how 3 PoF metas a day can kill HoT.
---
&gt;We believe that elite specializations are a more meaningful choice when they have some trade-off or change some core part of a profession's mechanics.
---
To me this seems more like they're simply going to neuter elite specs going forward in the name of bland balance.
---
Balance is a false idol, I'd much rather have elite specs that are fun and stand above the base profession than ones that are watered down to try and incentivise the bland base prof.
---
&gt; content: 9-man raids, small-scale WvW (on 
---
oke will deside tonight than:P
---
everything else then engineer is fine with me:)
---
Hell yeah it's active.
---
It's a good time to jump back in, although a few weeks ago would have been better.
---
They had the full expansion pack on sale and have been giving away Living World Season 4 releases for free to promote returning players.
---
It's sad that the only thing you want for metas to improve is to boost the rewards. How about improve the actual meta? Treasure hunting and coin collection is simply boring.
---
Trade-offs allow making changes to core professions that won't be inherited by elite specializations.
---
Without them, any change you make to skills and traits of the core profession will also be made to the elite specialization, and so you can't improve the core profession separately. 
---
Take necromancer. When core necromancer feels underwhelming, you can go to their Death Shroud skills and give some extra "oomph" there, while reaper and scourge won't get that because they have Reaper Shroud and Shades instead.
---
Now look at mesmer. Since they do not have an unique F5 and Chronomancer and Mirage have the same shatters, you can't give core mesmer a little more power to compete with Chrono and Mirage, because any change you do to any of their traits and skills will also go to Chrono and Mirage. 
---
One can argue about what the trade-off could be, but trade-offs are indubitably necessary.
---
In GW2 release version and for a year or two (or was it three? Cant remember), legendaries was soulbound and unique. So if you wanted say a thief with double legendary daggers... you had to build two of them. On that character. If you then wanted to wield two legandary daggers on your ele, you had to build 2 more of them. On that second character.
---
So yeah if you want to know the point of that? It was to improve the system a thousand fold.
---
I've had him since I created my account, so roughly 2-3 years now.  
---
Also, I didn't even think of the birthday gifts, definitely keeping him now!
---
However I would like some recommendations on where to use him since it does feel like a shame to just let him sit there.  
---
I currently only have Druid on him as I was into healing a while back, but have grown tired of it.  
---
How is Soulbeast doing?
---
Thanks again!
---
Start with Reaper, gear is easier to get.
---
  
---
Then work towards gearing scourge. Once you have both, you don't have to choose anymore, switching is immediate.
---
So you can play what you feel like at that time.
---
I don't know.
---
They wont do anything tbh. Maybe 500 more dps for power reaper. Not a big deal
---
yeah definitely. now in FFXIV the bonus for vets is mostly xp, which of course is irrelevant in gw2, but bonus mag shards (above the weekly limit), higher chance for the rare items (like the portal device), more kp (which shouldn't exist as kp anyway, but rather for the guild stuff), some gold or raid food etc would certainly help getting vets to join newbie groups.
---
in addition, the duty finder most certainly is another huge difference, though unless gw2 starts to declare roles per build, which is already somewhat unrealistic, I don't see how they could to that easily. but then again, that's the Devs jobs to figure out.
---
ultimately, gw2 sucks at getting players to get into new content (beside ls), and it certainly wouldn't be a 1-2 week job to fix it, but it's far from impossible if they just dedicated some resources towards that goal instead of sitting around designing gem store skins and designing content that few people see more than once in their lifetime
---
&gt;"WoW used to be hardcore"
---
hah
---
Can you repeat the question?
---
Nah, the way he says it, there would be the same amount of legendary skins in the game.
---
If you saw a legendary it would be one of two possibilites:
---
* He unlocked the legendary skin, by making the legendary account bound (same as today)
---
* He bought / made the legendary, but didn't bind it. Thus, if he sold it on, he won't have the item and thus, wouldn't have any character with that legendary.
---
I don't have an opinion on the matter, just making it clearer what he meant.
---
Oh I see, well I'll give it a shot! Thanks for the answer!
---
I know, that's why the twice told Legend was created
---
I see, thanks!
---
Game is doing fine. Enough people playing to do all the content I want. Obviously older zones are less populated than the newest zones, but that's true in every MMO. 
---
Due to the way mega servers are handled, and the way Anet controls traffic with things like dailies and collections and achievements, there are always people around doing stuff...even older content.
---
After experiencing the climb to T4 fractals and then CM's, and getting into raiding... I'd definitely say that death is the only consequence that actually teaches mechanics.
---
If it's not something that kills them, a surprising amount of players won't even notice that they did anything wrong. 
---
Take the Mai Trin fight in fractals as an example. I've had multiple groups in the lower tier fractals where they'd just fail the mechanic to remove her damage resistance over and over and over and over again, even when you explain it to them repeatedly. It's not something that's hurting them, so they just don't pay attention to it during the fight.
---
I don’t understand how that is diggetent from the system we have right now? So either A) Account bind it or B) Sell it?
---
If you wear the legendary today, you bind it iirc. Haven't made one in ages.
---
Op is complaining because this buff is 100% useless for a condi tempest and also 90% useless for raids because its not increasing the DPS it only increases the cleave. And thats nice to have but not mendatory.
---
You are not the boss of me, now! ♪
---
i still dont understand,why there cant be,easy,normal,hard,legendary difficulty,with extreme differences in rewards ofc.
---
kinda
---
In other words, he wants to equip the legendary and be able to sell it on later. Without unlocking the skin.
---
Soulbeast is great, works well in [fractals](https://discretize.eu/builds/ranger/power-soulbeast) and is easy to gear as power. Can also go the [condition build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/soulbeast/condition/) in raids though its harder to [gear](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character). If you're into PvP or WvW soulbeast has great burst damage and movement options for 1v1 fights and [roaming](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Soulbeast_-_Sic_%27Em_Roamer).
---
For endgame like raids it means nothing. There the „buff“ is plain useless. For open world bois its nice but for DPS potential its just useless. Not a DPS buff only a QoL buff for farmin in open world.
---
Are you alive? Hmm
---
&gt; Berserk is a level 3 burst, while primal bursts are probably level 1 bursts, as theyve been for a long time now.
---
incorrect. berserk is currently a rage skill, while primal bursts are currently level 1 bursts. berserk will **become** a level 3 burst, and we don't actually know if primal bursts will remain level 1 bursts or not.
---
&gt; And did you completely miss the trait changes and buffs to primal bursts that reward you for staying in berserk?
---
i didn't miss them. they, like the changes to daredevil, are terrible.
---
berserker currently already fits its theme. these simply aren't the changes that should be made.
---
Warrior: always needed due to banners and has a good condi and power build. 
---
Guardian: versatile dps and support builds. 
---
•Dragonhunter is top tier for burst damage so it is amazing in fractals and power phase bosses in raids. You have very good sustain. 
---
•firebrand, amazing healer and power/condi quickness buff.  
---
Ranger: versitile dps and support builds for both raids and fractals. Druids are always needed and top tier fractals there is always a slot for either a druid or a soulbeast. 
---
Mesmer: mirage is best in slot on most condi bosses. Power chrono is good on power bosses. Only do this to yourself if you have a big hard on to play support chrono in fractals.
---
&gt; A daredevil is not a brawler, they jump into battle, do stuff, and evade out when people switch their attention to them. A brawler would stay in the middle of the fray, a daredevil would try to be on the edge and move closer to finish off lower health enemies, and away when targeted.
---
then there's no need to change anything, because that's what daredevils (and thieves) currently are. these changes are supposed to give daredevils a different role (brawler), but they aren't enough. instead, they simply made it weaker with no new gameplay opportunities.
---
&gt; The argument I've advanced here is that adding an easy mode will not help the raiding community in the slightest
---
Well duh. It's not a request by or for the "raiding community" in the first place.
---
&gt;and for casuals the only meaningful benefit would be the ability to consume raid story.
---
Which is precisely why people want an "easy" mode. It's not a matter of difficulty.
---
People like myself would like to consume the story content that is contained within the raids, but for whatever reason doing so within the raid framework is either unfeasible or uncompelling.
---
The real "content" of raids is the encounters and associated rewards, not the story. So stripping out the rewards along with the difficulty would allow people to enjoy the growing sum of narrative content without diminishing raids themselves.
---
Heeeeere's Kralky!
---
From the beginning I always kind of felt as if Heart of Thorns was better...Yea, the PvE content and mounts in Path of Fire are phenomenal. But the overall play style and map metas from Heart of Thorns felt like some of the best "End Game content" to replay and enjoy - Living, breathing, almost raid/dungeon like content where the setup and cool fights / mechanics all meshed together...Unfortunately I feel like that's greatly lacking in Path of Fire. Heart of Thorns felt more like an "expansion" to me - whereas Path of Fire felt more like a large content packed Living World Episode + extra cool mechanics and content. Personally, I feel like if they took 50% of the Heart of Thorns style content and 50% of Path of Fire style content and meshed them together - We'd have an amazing expansion with the perfect balance of story / PvE content and end game longevity.
---
Raids in Guild Wars 2 are in an absolutely terrible spot for the majority of players while WoW at least offers different difficulties and progression through them if you wish. The issues you mention with a limited player pool simply don't happen in WoW since there are a plethora of guilds and groups out there and far more active players than in Guild Wars 2. 
---
Guild Wars 2 raids are too challenging for the majority of players (otherwise people wouldn't feel the need to bring up easy modes for any reason) but quickly grow dull and stale for those that can complete them. There is nothing novel about killing VG every week for 3 and a half years and nothing to progress when you can do the bosses comfortably.
---
It is a shame because the content is, generally, pretty fun but is in a really bad spot of losing experienced players to burnout and boredom while making it difficult for new people to get into raids.
---
If it relaunches can we start with old lions arch again and fight scarlet again and all that. Updates every two weeks changing what’s going on in the story. I miss that that’s what kept me playing. Now i’ve come back solely for wvw cuz dungeons are dead
---
Mace is better healing and if you have a druid in squad you don't need might from staff.
---
You mean, "Made in Cantha".
---
If you join raid training servers, OCX / SEA time is actually covered really well on both NA raid training servers. I know this because i almost exclusively host training runs during OCX / SEA time and I do multiple per day.
---
Mace has really weak healing (literally just autoattack, and symbol if u run that trait) since regen is already covered in a heal fb build, and staff 2 &amp; 4 have HUGE healing.
---
&gt; Thing is, nobody will ever run Core death shroud later into the game. No base class but Warrior and Guardian will ever be good.
---
EXACTLY.
---
You cannot make them good if you do not have a difference that will affect core without affecting specializations.  
---
People have gotten into the mentality that they should be upgrades, when they are not meant to be that. They are meant to change the profession, not merely improve it.  
---
&gt; The class mechanic should not have a trade-off because you chose another Traitline. It should always be an upgrade if you choose an elite spec.
---
Nope. That's not the idea behind specializations, otherwise core players would never stand a chance in PvP.  
---
What put people in that mindset is years of balance that was not able to convey properly the intended design they kept communicating.  
---
These changes are a great step in the right direction. Whether you agree on the specific tradeoffs or not, tradeoffs themselves are a necessity.
---
but outside of raids, druid doesn't need to be unplayable
---
Well great for them! I'm happy they have all the time to play a game. I do not. 
---
Exactly what it sounds like, I mean, I'd settle for a cutscene heavy instance, but I imagine for most, just a really dumbed down encounter would do. Still have the mechanics that make raids special but reduce the health &amp; damage done. 
---
As I said, I don't need rewards, just having the story in full context is rewarding enough for me. I'd treat it like a LS episode. I'd do it once, tick it off my list and never go back. No harm to the "hardcore git gud" crowd, best solution for everyone.
---
Honestly Anet needs to go further and normalize (spread the effect around even if it has a different name) some of the unique boons/effects provided by specs.
---
Then they could adjust numbers so classes wouldn't be balanced around being the only one that provides that one thing everyone has to have.
---
The ideal setup is   
---
Boon Chrono, Healing Druid, Banner Warrior, 2 DPS
---
As far as composition goes, you can expect that to not change. What does change with balance patches is the build itself though. Boon Chrono tends to have some gear changes patch to patch, while Healing Druid may also but is less likely to. Someone mentioned snowcrows in another reply here, you can go there to check out detailed builds.
---
Banner Warrior is fairly stable, people prefer that you go power, so usually there is no gear change from patch to patch. Though certain weapons may become more desirable than others. That said, the gear is usually full Berserker stat gear with Scholar Runes. 
---
Finally DPS. Most groups will take 3 DPS if they can't find a banner warrior. Banner Warrior is usually like the cherry on top. Most DPS work, though the problem is that between balance patches the DPS class that you play may very well be nerfed into the ground so there is a risk there if I were to recommend which DPS classes are the best :  
---
1) Dragon Hunter : This is hands down the best at the moment. It has wonderful cleave, wonderful CC, can pull enemies together, great burst, good sustain, awesome utility, and it's easy to play. It requires the typical power set of gear, Berserkers with Scholars, Scepter, Focus, Greatsword. 
---
2) Holosmith : This is almost as good as Dragon Hunter. It has comparable if not superior CC for Breakbars but worse for dealing with groups. It can pull enemies together, but that requires sacrificing a DPS utility which Dragon Hunter doesn't have to do. The burst is almost as good as DH, the sustain is better. It's a bit harder to play than Dragon Hunter and the rotation is more static where as DH's rotation can be adjusted easier. The one place where Holosmith really excels is the Aquatic Fractal. Holosmith by far can dish out the most underwater DPS of any class, I often find myself doing 2 to 3 times as much damage as any other class when underwater.
---
3) Soulbeast or Reaper : I actually don't know much about these classes, but I do see them occasionally in Fractal Groups and they do decent DPS, that said, they are definitely not as useful as the above two.
---
4) Weaver and Daredevil : Both classes are usable, and both have much higher sustain DPS than any above, however both have some problems that I would say make them significantly less desirable. Neither have a good pull or any really good cleave, this makes them significantly less useful during trash packs. The skills in their rotations have long animation locks which means you will often get hit with a knockback in the middle of a powerful attack. At any rate, these feel clunky to play in Fractals, they are primarily classes that are good DPS on certain raid bosses.
---
This will always happen.
---
People get used to stuff that should not have been there in the first place because it's left untouched for way too long, then they think can't live without it when it gets fixed.  
---
And in a month or so the meta change and people adapt and they forget about it.
---
put a mask on kralk and he's really not that far off of the evil guy in SAB.
---
Oversimplified comment that mocks players in a picture format? TO THE TOP WITH YOU!
---
They have lots of dodges, but no real damage mitigation otherwise.
---
Honestly what the game needs is trade off traits.
---
By that I mean traits that greatly increase how effective one thing is or add something completely new but also decrease how effective something else is.
---
This would give them the option to give completely new roles to elite specs but balance them out in other ways
---
Druid is more than playable outside Raids.
---
and then add glyph of industry into it
---
Not useless, just bad. Rifle obviously doesnt work since its, well, Rifle, D/D doesnt do enough damage, and staffs movement interacts poorly with several bosses.
---
Because druid hasn't actually been mandatory for a very long time. The meta is just the meta, it's what people are comfortable with, what they enjoy, what people have practised with and are used to, there's so much inertia there that they could delete druid and people would still be asking for 2 druids for their raids for the next 6 months. 
---
And yeah if you enjoy playing a class and spend most of your time with a class maybe it does actually make the game less fun for you if your class is constantly getting all its stuff totally reworked and or nerfed. Maybe there was stuff you really liked about those classes that's now gone. Obviously that's not fun, clearly that'd make you upset. Stacking nerfs on nerfs on nerfs isn't actually a good way to change how people play, it's just a good way to upset people. 
---
Anet clearly have a deep desire to change the meta for some reason (change isn't inherently good, and doesn't necessarily breathe new life into things, it has to actually be good change to do that) so what they really need to do is a find some people who are actually good at raids and fractals to consult and take a deep look in to what is actually good about the classes and compositions (the perfect jigsaw of boon uptime is a big one) that are meta, look at the mechanics in boss fights and what things are good and bad at dealing with them, look at why people don't play certain classes no matter how many numerical buffs you give them or nerfs you apply to competing classes (hint: it's usually because their mechanics are inherently clunky, looking at you healing rev) and then they need to do the work to find a way to make less used classes more suitable for the content that they want to see them in without compromising any of the class's core class identities.
---
I've actually been a strong advocate of this for a long time now! Homogenize all the dumb unique \*passive\* effects in generic ones available in multiple ways, and keep the class identity through gameplay and active abilities.
---
Yeah, they might need to just add separate class of buffs called *Auras* or something and just standardize them.  So there is a power aura, healing aura, etc.
---
Every class doesn't need access to all of them right now but each elite spec could bring in new ones.  So for warriors, banners would provide the same aura as spirits would for rangers.
---
As much as I love Condi Reaper, it's difficult to call it better than Power Reaper or Condi Scourge due to a number of factors (each does well in different categories, play styles, difficulties, etc.)
---
Aside from the learning curve of Condi being higher due to needing to understand combo field shenanigans, Power Reaper is less reliant on allies nowadays due to the boons it gives itself and Condi Scourge is a more stable output of condition damage.
---
Condi Reaper is most definitely fun, but a subjective opinion does not a better build make.
---
Thank you!
---
This next episode should be interesting. 
---
Enjoy it.
---
You don't need more than 4 people to finish (most) raids, either.
---
Doesn't mean that that's what everyone should strive for, or what the game should be balanced around.
---
Same with unique buffs.
---
You don't need them to clear the content, but having a sensible mix/balance of them certainly makes the content more manageable and allows non-perfectionists to have a shot at clearing it, too.
---
Nope. Everyone in this sub are figments of your imagination.
---
Boon chrono is the easiest its ever been and ironically the same gameplay as HoT launch, you just dump all your wells and press SOI.
---
I must not let fear poison my heart, not even in this forsaken wasteland.
---
Thank you so much for your help! Your Build Editor guide is exactly what I'm looking for, since I have a commander amulet, ring, earring and backpiece (as per the old meta boon chrono set up). I don't necessarily trust my own boon duration, and I'm running with PUGs so as high as possible is better. I haven't managed to get into raiding, so a set for fractals will do. Eventually I'll gear up my guardian; while I would prefer to play mesmer, constantly re-gearing is irritating...
---
It's also a MMO - not a single player game that can throw balance to the wind - and has to keep balance in mind and pretending that removing admittedly overpowered aspects of classes is "removing all class flavor and uniqueness" is disingenuous AF. Removing Glyph of Empowerment isn't removing pets or CA from druid, and those things actually define it.
---
Druid is also an extremely easy source of 10-man might. Are we all forgetting that suddenly? 
---
Its heals also aren't that strong but extremely easy to heal with, compared to something like the current state of a Renegade/Herald where healing with the tablet isn't always the most co-operative affair.
---
Warrior is still irreplacable.
---
Yes it does. By making a game that everyone *can* play we are getting the game that very few people will *want* to play. Setting some standards might lock some edge case players out of some parts of the game (I'm pretty sure that not all gw2 players are single parents with a litter or &gt;1year babies, so please, don't try to play this bullshit), but will provide more engagement for others.
---
that approach would actually provide less diversity in used classes. 
---
Without unique buffs or abilities some classes would not see play.
---
Adding more unique but equally strong buffs would further diversify the optimal group compositions as you would want to stack less classes.
---
Try joining training/practice runs! LFG is terrible. Go in with groups that are willing to teach/be patient with new players and you'll get the skills needed to enjoy your time in hard content.
---
True! There's no link between the two. which was my point.
---
From a PvP/WvW standpoint:
---
Berserker's burst potential sounds terrifying, but the loss of the insta-taunt should keep it from getting too out of hand.  Looking forward to trying it out.
---
Mesmer changes seem like a good step towards addressing how difficult they've been to balance.  The blind duration on Cry of Frustration seems short relative to similar abilities, but I'm okay with it as it provides less passive safety.
---
Core Revenant has some potential which will depend on the cooldown of the F2 skill, but I'm excited to see how it plays.  The new Salvation traits seem intriguing as well if the numbers add up.
---
Daredevil losing 600 range on steal is *rough*, but it certainly fits their stated goal of introducing a trade-off for the specialization.  The rest of the trait changes seem like a functional wash but improvements in terms of distinct choices.
---
Thanks for your reply. I know the meta is diviners with rune of the pack - but what I currently have is  berserker/commander with runes of leadership. How much difference does diviners and rune of the pack really make? Is it really worth grinding for the mats for diviner runes and the money for runes of the pack, given what I already have and with another balance patch on the way...
---
But if you do replace Druid, you need to make some changes to ensure the whole group has 25 might, whether that's by having the warrior take something like Phalanx Strength and having a Renegade use Heroic Command and using stuff like guardian scepter 2 and &gt;50% portion of vulture stance to stack might. Stuff that's probably a bit more effort than a lot of pug groups want to think about. Or a Tempest, Tempest can do that do I believe, but relies on blast finishers which isn't the greatest.
---
Not sure how many people who are posting here actually play this game or understand the meta. Druid hasnt been meta for awhile now, but we've got people saying "its about time we have other visble alternatives." Druid WAS that viable alternative to support meta, and after this upcoming change, it will even be less viable. 
---
The reason this balance patch is so insane, is that its buffing two of the meta classes pretty substantially! Warrior already has a guaranteed spot in every 5 or 10 man group, and rev was already the one of the best support options. Both of these classes also have their own powerful unique buffs, but everyone is just, "druid shouldn't be allowed to have a unique buff".
---
I totally agree. But that's not what you said before; " And in a month or so the meta change and people adapt and they forget about it." That's a bad mentality to have. If they remove an entire class, people will complain, the meta will change and eventually people will move on. Does that mean criticizing is to be dismissed? I ofc exaggerated the point as to show the flow in your statement
---
Tempest just has to overload fire and use warhorn 4. Ez 25 might on targets.
---
I've seen a fair share of pugs ask for FB/Ren in fractals, but I've yet to really see any raid pugs ask for quickness firebrands and alacrity renegades over Chronos and they still almost always have at least one druid.
---
Yes, the two he gave in the OP...
---
Under normal circumstances I might've done that, but I'm not sinning *yet*
---
Anet did do some nerfs last balance patch, but it definitely wasn't really enough. Soulbeast with spirits is similar for any hypothetical non-druid compositions.
---
I'd imagine at the moment right now you could probably get a workable composition with 2x FB, 1 Ren, and 1 heal Tempest that would work well. But of course, the Warrior remains.
---
i fucking love this. the one on daredevil and rev too. 
---
it's how all elite specs shouldve been from the start. not just free shit on top of your class, but some actual tradeoffs.
---
I have to correct you on a few things here.
---
Druid and Chrono aren't part of the ideal (meta) comp.
---
That would be Diviner Renegade and a Quickbrand instead. Now I understand that PUGs generally run with a healer and to have the highest dps you'd run with a Healrenegade. For smoother runs you'd take a Healbrand (because Firebrand's healing kit is better than Renegade's). 
---
Ideally for dps you would take a Soulbeast (for frost spirit) and a Weaver (for skips). 
---
The most flexible profession to play in fractals and raids is Guardian. You need different gear sets but you can play T4 fractals as Quickbrand+Dragonhunter with full Berserker armour. You also have the option to be condi dps and condi Quickbrand for raids (you need full Viper gear) and with a different gear set you can be a Healbrand. 
---
And in general power dps is meta for fractals because condi dps has some "starting time"--&gt;random mobs take longer to die. For raids it depends on the boss. There is no universal pdps or cdps (that I know of) thats good for all bosses. 
---
Lastly raids usually want a condi BS while fractals want a power BS. A power BS doesn't run full Berserker either. It's a mix between Assassin and Berserker. With pure Berserker you'd lack precision for 100% crit chance.
---
Then the gear also depends on if you run with a druid or a Firebrand/Renegade. If you don't run with a Druid you lose [Spotter (100 Precision)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spotter).
---
To see the difference in gear check [here.](https://discretize.eu/builds/warrior/banner-warrior)
---
ppl still dont play fb+rene?
---
Kinda what it was for
---
You're saying that as if you've found my Twitter /)w(\
---
the icon that shows up is the increased critical damage when you attune to air. when you get a sacrificial hit, you should see that the recharge on your air attainment gets completed instantly instead - there is no icon
---
Good thing we have mounts to get back to fights sooner after Pepega
---
We're all furry inside ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
It doesn't matter because condi necro minionmancer doesn't do anything useful other than aggroing mobs and facetanking.
---
If you picked a build that only looks good, might as well take an elite skill that looks appealing as well.
---
25 man might and access to utility like glyph of tides / entangle is just too much to give up, and even without Glyph of Empowerment they still have the unique buffs Spotter and Frost/Sun Spirit.
---
I'm not on the eggplant territory yet. And certainly I'm not tainting reddit with my sin ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
My three spell bois are charr (ash legion mesmer) sylvari (dusk bloom elementalist) and asura (synergetics necromancer). This comment makes me feel SO validated right now.
---
Based on how they worded it, they aren't even nerfing it, just moving it to normal utility.  That alone should speak to how weak for an elite that it was.
---
I'm just saying for an elite it should have been stronger.
---
Yeah, but atm feels really old, game changed a lot and it shoud definitely evolve like everything else kinda did
---
" The meta is just the meta, it's what people are comfortable with, what they enjoy, what people have practised with and are used to, "
---
A META is not what people are happy with our used to. It is the MOST EFFECTIVE way to play. 
---
If it wasn't most effective, it was never Meta. Perhaps there is another abbreviation that needs to be quoted, but it certainly is not meta.
---
flash golem for sustain dps + strong cc skill
---
lich form for more burst dmg
---
Others can give boons, no one else gives banners.
---
flash golem for more sustain dps + strong cc skill
---
lich form should have more upfront dmg with the minions you can summon i guess
---
Coincidence for the asura and sylvari lol. The charr just felt best in ash legion. I can’t imagine one from the other two legions relying as much on deception and trickery in a fight.
---
Plus, that revenant can't do full might stacks to the entire squad. You'd need *two* might-stackers in the squad (or a dedicated healer and a dedicated might stacker) in which case... why not just use druid as the might class while retaining its utility, Spotter, spirits, and such? Also, the new Glyph of Unity might be worth taking now to patch up the "druid isn't actually that good at healing". Druid is already a really strong healer if you take Lingering Light anyway!
---
What about when I can’t go through a portal or everyone in squad is hitting lord and I’m still looking at them standing at the gate that on my screen isn’t down? How long can I expect until I can play again
---
If they would just get around to normalizing special effects this wouldn't be nearly as much of an issue.
---
As for ele, that is one way they could normalize the effect.
---
Give tempest some trait that says when you grant an ally an aura they also do +5% damage for the next X seconds. Then make it so it won't stack with similar effects like the spirit.
---
Meta is not an abbreviation.
---
The meta doesn't imply that it is the best setup.  It only implies that it is a commonly acknowledged and recognized way to play by the community at large.
---
As an example, druid + condi necro groups were meta in fractals for quite a while despite being significantly less effective than the popular power groups at the time (in the hands of top tier groups).  The necro groups were nearly foolproof however, which is why they dominated the pug scene for months.
---
🐮🍺！
---
META = Most Effective Tactic Available
---
Only place minion master is any good is small scale PvP and even there it is outdone by other necro specs.
---
Honestly I'm hoping we get a redesign at some point that makes the minions act like mobile boon/buff bots so at least it will be useful.
---
Ok then enjoy your 7 minute vg runs.
---
The problem is you have so few gap closer to let you land P/D 3. It is just steal and infiltrator signet.
---
An easier difficulty literally doesn't remove any mode that other players *want* to play so your argument has very little basis. It adds something for some people - who will likely still support the game through gem store and expansion sales - and takes nothing away from anyone else.
---
That is the main downside of necro.
---
Other classes have lots of damage mitigation that works in % amounts so it stays good no matter who or how many are attacking you.
---
Shroud don't scale that way so it gets progressively worse the more people decide to beat on you.
---
If they're normalizing effects though... Isn't that what the boon system is for? So if "empowered" becomes a generic effect applicable by multiple support classes, why not just make it a dang boon?
---
Also, unique effects *do* allow for some build diversity. For example, life leech effects like Soulcleave's Summit are usually weaker than raw damage up effects, but the leech helps a lot in certain situations like Gorseval's tantrum.
---
If people refuse to take 30 minutes of their time to get at least get 25k dps then I don't see it them spending 30 minutes of time trying to get a boss kill. Knowing a basic rotation also helps in open world.
---
Yes, police? I'd like to report a murder.
---
My windows defender always detect it as unsafe! D: what to do?
---
It’s shopped. In actuality it is your character’s name if you’re Asura.
---
Soulbeast&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Druid in PvP/WvW.
---
We have a mandatory profession, but the form of it at least shifts situationally -- power warrior vs condi warrior play quite differently from each other and have different strengths, and the upcoming change to berserker is probably going to shift that even more.  Druid is just druid, no matter where it shows up.
---
Man, I would consider that pubic tuft a bit more explicit that any implications a literal eggplant might have.
---
Doesn't change the fact that losing boons hurts a lot more than losing banners.
---
&gt; I come from math
---
This isn't math. Don't treat it like this is math.
---
I'm just going to drop this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Za8HggalY).  Thanks for the morning laugh y'all.
---
I where responding to your comment, not the OP. Ofc the pet nerf does factor in there too.
---
Where did i mention glyph of empowerement?
---
Shake the game like shake-n-bake.  The only thing I saw that I thought was heavy handed was the Druid pet thing, but even then I can see where they're coming from.  It'll just cause Druid to be played much less, cause there's such limited areas of the game that require dedicated healing; that and other specs are going to heal better.
---
in FFXIV you can learn all jobs on the same character. so in gw2 terms, you can start as a necro and level warrior on the same character. however, leveling is kinda grindy, so whenever you wanna level a new job, your best bet is to do dungeons, trials (single boss fights) or raids with that job. there's a lfg roulette where you can daily join for example a trial and get increased xp rewards. you may be leveling the class, but you already did it a few times on your main class so you do know mechanics etc. in return you gain a large amount of xp for the class you're currently playing. so even if you have a job at max level, you may very well like to level a few others, and the roulettes, which tend to favour filling groups with new players, will give you great xp while also helping someone newer to complete whatever they need. 
---
in addition, whenever you do an instance with people who never did it before, you gain increased currency. these tomestones can be used to buy the best gear except max level. so while leveling another job you gain a lot of this currency to immediately deck yourself in the best gear at level 50/60. at 70 you'll need another currency I think, but I'm not there yet (locked behind story progression), so I can't say anything about max level gearing yet. 
---
the game came out initially in 2011 I think, and now early 2019 I joined and never had trouble finding groups, often with endgame geared players. and many times I do a roulette myself, there's a player who never did it before, so even me as a newbie gets the increased rewards. all in all it's very noob friendly and actively encourages players to do stuff that helps new players. like wiping a bit isn't so bad when you know you gain double currency rewards at the end :)
---
In pve you just want be allowed anywhere, where you would be able to compete with others. Raids and expansion-only, high fractals are locked behind expansions indirectly (with a *great* effort you might be able to get there, but it sn't worth it), all new content is released withing expansions. 
---
Spvp and wvw sometimes happen to have a very few competetive builds that don't use elite specializations, however.
---
death
---
good!
---
I contacted him through Instagram initially! [victor ](https://instagram.com/victortandesign?utm_source=ig_profile_share&amp;igshid=1nljf3jvnqgsx)
---
So because it swaps stats, that's alright? Druid swaps utilities and weapon sets on just about every fight, does that count too?
---
Of course not, that's why I'm saying I'm not against doing *different* changes. But the changes have to be done in a way that won't encourage using some things over others.
---
Often when people see their profession getting something replaced will suggest instead to give other professions something similar, but that will result in power creep.
---
Any changes that won't result in power creep will always feel like a nerf, unfortunately.
---
Good balance with variable builds is very hard to get, because it is often done trough 'incomparables'. Mechanics that can't be compared numeraically. 
---
As players all we can do is giving our opinions when we see the changes, and hoping they'll have time to do something else if one of us suggest something they think would be better than what they got.
---
Thief can run without elite specs to just about the same effect as well.
---
I don't think I've seen it in *any*.
---
Because it entirely swaps its strengths and playstyle, it makes it less of an issue.  I'd still love to see something done about banners, but the class currently is basically doing the dps role and you just need _any_ warrior along to use them.  You can't grab any ranger and they'll fill druid for you.
---
Meta is not an acronym, it's an abbreviation for metagame and a prefix meaning outside of or beyond, see for instance metaphysics which I assure you doesn't mean "Most effective tactic available physics".
---
Check the most recent patch bites. The intent for elite specializations were for players to have tradeoffs.  A Weaver versus an Elementalist has slower full atunes.  A Scourge gains some great contions and buffs, but loses their second health bar.  A berserker loses some of the adrenaline meter in exchange for more powerful adrenaline skills.
---
However per the patch notes they acknowledge that isn't always the case.  Some classes like druid don't have a huge tradeoff, you just get a lot of new strengths with minimal weaknesses.  They're working on adjusting them so that they are more clearly defined tradeoffs, but it'll take a few more patches to get there.
---
So short version, yes you're at a disadvantage right now, no you shouldn't always be at a disadvantage.
---
I sent him a few close up shots of her from the front, side and back. Then a shot with her bow drawn. Separate shot of the pet, he looked up the animation for that himself. I don’t have them uploaded anywhere or I would just send you a link :)
---
What exactly do you want to do? What do you mean with "compete with others"?
---
You mention PvE, so open world? There is no competition there, base specs work fine Dungeons, fractals (low/high level?)? 
---
Raids are an expansion feature so you can't even join them.
---
Competitive content as in PvP&amp;WvW is a different topic.
---
To add onto that, maybe try playing through a VPN.  
---
There are a few out there that give you a free trial month/money back if you dont like it after a month.  
---
I used to be unable to browse reddit for quite some time (everything loading extremly slowly), as well as having issues in various online games.  
---
Getting a VPN fixed that issue 100%.
---
You do have to take in a ping loss of roughly 10-XXXMS depending on your connection and your location (i.e. my LoL ping went from 27 to 38MS)
---
Oh well, I was planning to main mesmer, and have an alt ele. that sucks
---
If you go to the GW1 wiki, and check the [charr](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charr) page, you can see that there's some types with 'ash' or 'ashen' and 'chaos' or 'mind' in their names.
---
When you look at their models, their fur is grey. I always considered those to be the ancient Ash legion because of the 'ash' names, and ash-named ones sharing models with he chaos/mind ones.
---
That's quite the long game ANet had there, if that was ever intended.
---
&gt;3 hours in a row
---
Exactly this. This is why I only do DS meta a few times *a year*. I'm no longer a uni student that can put in hours upon hours of uninterrupted gaming.
---
So, what's the "trade-off" for straight adding Continuum Split, or straight buffing an instant cast Evade, which also lets you continue your normal actions?
---
Can I just ask what you're trying to compete with exactly? Like what aspect of the game are you looking at that you feel this competitive edge is given to others with elite specs?  Core PvE has nothing in it that should feel like you're competing for anything. There are no raids, and fractals/dungeons can be done with core classes, its much more a group effort than a solo effort, so while you might feel like you are competing with the party, you need to see it more as assisting one another and helping the group get through the content
---
Are the new Druid changes a nerf? With glyph of empowerment gone, you think druids will be replaced by better healers?
---
Are the new Druid changes a nerf? With glyph of empowerment gone, do you think druids will be replaced by better healers?
---
I cannot believe that the eggplant is less explicit than a tiny bit of fur there &gt;:U !
---
Not sure if you know but this site is an official retailer of ANET and has the expansions discounted quite a lot https://www.nuuvem.com/catalog/search/guild%20wars
---
First of all, the answer "it's server lag and you can't fix it" that some people will offer is bullshit. When every member of your group is experiencing identical symptoms, then you can blame the server. Your video and your descriptions indicate that other members of your group aren't having the problem.
---
&gt; What about when I can’t go through a portal or everyone in squad is hitting lord and I’m still looking at them standing at the gate that on my screen isn’t down?
---
This indicates a communication problem between your computer and the server as explained by /u/Wistworn_RXA.
---
For me, these problems were caused 100% by my ISP. You may have different results, but it's at least worth trying the solution. Go to the Guild Wars 2 wiki and read about [Command Line Arguments](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments). The specific argument you want to use is */clientport 80* or *-clientport 80*. They both work the same way and tell the GW2 client to use port 80 to connect to the server rather than port 6112. Many ISPs, mine included, deprioritize traffic on port 6112 because that's a port commonly used by games and the ISPs have decided that your gaming experience is less important than the web surfing done by other people. It may or may not fix the problem, but it's a very easy place to start.
---
[$30 for both.](https://www.nuuvem.com/catalog/search/guild%20wars) Or get them separately, just look up which elite specs you want. If you want to raid, start with HoT.
---
It’s really not but okay.
---
If I'm in a guild, and there's my core mesmer and a chrono, same level, same gear, same skill. I will never be chosen to play in a group with them, because the chrono is arguably better. I dont have space in groups without the expansions. Thats competition.
---
If im playing in a dungeon and I'm never able to surpass some elite spec DPS, thats also competition. I dont want to play knowing I will never reach the level of someone no matter how much I try. You see my point? at least thats what Im getting from this comment section.
---
And here is a reason why it might work. RIFT is a game which is dying hard, but regardless of that they have a few things that are really nice and one of those are adventures. What you do is you join a squad, the game port you to the area where that squad is for now and you do tasks together. Sort of like what small events are in GW2 but they are made for this purpose and goes from anything from killing 50 fairies too bosses or defend points. 
---
BUT here is what it also is. RIFT had an old raid that involved a lot of bosses. When it came out it was a long raid that took a loong time to break down for all guilds. Either way many expansions later they decide to make a easy version of it and add it to the adventure. You will be in the same area as the real raid, you will fight the same bosses with the same mechanics but they are dumbed down to a point were a adventure of level cap players and low level players that are only lvl 10 can manage. You wont get raid rewards but you get better rewards then the blues and the greens we have. Sometimes you get rewards as good as our exotic bur for the level you are. This is a very good way to find people to level up with and to learn game mechanics. The game teach you this by adding this mechanics to easy bosses and new players get interested to see more and start to look for raiding guilds and so on. 
---
Again the game bairly have a radining comunity it is very dead, but that does not change the fact that they done the thing people asking for. They made sort of a raid out of the old raids and left new, old, any levels (ofc they are upscaled to survive) and people go there to farm xp or other things. 
---
This adventures also move in to expansions area. So as a lvl 10 you get to level up in expansion area if this is were the next port goes. Again ofc upscaled and only in that specific area that are made for the adventure and if you pass it as a normal player you will not be a part of the adventure unless you join it. 
---
Anyway. This give a entrance to educate players about breakbars, showing boss mechanics or other mechanics the game offer but sucks at explaining. It train new players but on the level they are in and also give peaks on what to expect. I would say this works well and i wish GW2 would adapt to such thing as well. We really need a better new player experience and we really need a better way for players to enter raids without the preassure they have on them today. What RIFT done offer players exactly that. A raid enviroment that show what it could look like and what they could expect from raids if they want to try the real thing.
---
I pay money and get advantage agaisnt others, even if thats not my intention. If the expansions only gave more things to do, It would be okay. but elite specs are quite broken.
---
FYI since Arenanet changed to using AmazonAWS servers, you can't ping the GW2 servers any more. AmazonAWS servers don't respond to ping requests.
---
Do people not practice to get good at the other things they do for fun? Sports, art, music, crafts, cooking, other hobbies?
---
I get that not everyone wants to do that for every facet of their life, and video games may very well not be the focus so much as a diversion for lots of people (especially in a "casual" game like GW2) but to say that people don't want to practice for things they do for fun seems like a strange argument.
---
Nope definatley not. We post on here for fun and nostalgia purposes only.
---
All the Living World stuff would rank pretty highly; probably above PoF but not sure which seasons would beat HoT. Off the top of my head, I'd probably rank best to worst something like this: S3, HoT, S4, S2, PoF, Core.
---
I would agree that the S3 Maps are the best of the three seasons both in variety, events, and rewards. But while the S4 Maps do lack variety (mostly desert), they do still have some nice events and rewards, even if the ascended trinkets aren't as much as S3. And S2 is really just Silverwastes for me, but Silverwastes is a pretty fun map so... That said, while I did focus a bit on the maps, I was talking about the expansions as a whole and in terms of Story and Masteries, I think S4 ranks much higher than its overall ranking; it is mainly the rewards dragging it down.

“In the world of gaming, meta is used in two ways. Meta can be used as an acronym for “most effective tactics available,” and calling something “meta” means that it’s an effective way to achieve the goal of the game, whether it’s to beat other players or beat the game itself. Meta can also be short for metagame, which is using information about the game, derived from the world beyond the game or its rules, to influence the outcome of the game or gain a competitive edge.”
---
Druid hasn't been meta for fractals, but raids I'm pretty sure it absolutely has been (and will probably remain to be) meta as one of the easiest sources of 10-man might that also brings spotter and spirits along with it.
---
Same, I pugged all the way to CMs.  I have better luck with pugging fractals though, the runs are usually smoother than pugging at NA peak time.
---
As for training raid, there's a guild I'm in that doing training that's suitable to my timezone. But it doesn't always happen. Interesting enough, during training raids I'm often top 2 dps and last one standing. IMO some fractals can be harder than raids, sucks that I can't play raids as much.
---
Saying chrono is arguably better than base mesmer is giving the base mesmer too much credit tbh
---
&gt; there was a little tiny third best selling japanese game on steam that was released few weeks ago, that had all this "easy mode" crap around it. 
---
dont be daft. an optional easy mode in that game would have literally zero impact on the ~super duper hard mode~ all the hardcore gamers with infinite free time drool over. widening the audience would mean more people are able to play and enjoy the game.
---

Yes but you would be missing tons of fun with new content, new skills etc.

That's a backronym.

Tell me that boon chrono isn't much, *much* less fun or satisfying to play now than it used to be.
---
I get that a lot of people are just very opposed to any changes, but that point has a lot of merit.
---
Owning the game isn't pay to win
---
Oh wow I did not know about that. Thanks!!
---
Right now, there's a few builds that do fine, but elite specializations as their name says specialize professions in roles, allowing them to be better at those specific roles.  
---
So in high tier instanced content it's a bit harder for core-only to keep up, and the number builds that can compete with specialized ones is lower.
---
In the rest of the game it doesn't really matter, as the only role you need is DPS, and core professions can do that just fine thanks to Berserker and Marauder stats. Not in any spectacular way, but fine.
---
If they continue balance on these elite specialization 'trade-offs', if they do it right, that'll allow giving core a lit more competitiveness, as specializations would not inherit the changes if they are done in the mechanics that are traded to specialize. But that'll likely take quite some time down the road.
---
More violets, less violence
---
Anet is definitely not against [cleavage](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Inquest_armor_\(light\)). Anet is just one of the few companies that doesn't think it is needed 24/7.
---
So p2w is extremely tough to actually pin down and in the most liberal of definition (a free player should be as effective as a paying player) then almost every game is p2w.
---
What we have here is actually pretty complex. This is due to design being that elites are optional (and they are working on balancing them so) but right now balance has them better than their non-elite counterparts. So yes it does mean that spending money is required to be most effective. Most people do not consider it p2w because the cost is small ($50 for both, less than a new game or a new expansion for many games) for years of content (both years in past and years in the future), it is a one time cost, and past that no amount of money is going to make you more powerful.
---
This is compared to many of the p2w titles out there where people are more powerful (or skip 100s of hour grinds) by spending money so people out of $1ks and you cannot compete without paying.
---
this is good work!
---
This is an excellent idea, much better than my reduced damage one.
---
Open world is just staff AOE spam and hoping the zerg doesn't abandon you to die during your cast animation.
---
Tbf, if he's playing in t5 EU, anything could probably work lol
---
I like this armor, it lets his body breath, but some other places could use less armor like his legs OwO
---
You're welcome^^
---
That's one of the problems you see in raids. When there's weak adds spawning, they can be easily pulled and stacked to get cleaved. 
---
One or two encounters would be more interesting if they had adds that stay in place and can't be pulled or scatter back to farther positions after being stacked, so players have to bring medium range attacks and position themsleves to hit both the boss and adds.  
---
Imagine if warriors got a medium range polearm that worked with that idea in mind. Stab through the enemy and hit what's behind. That's be nice for PvP, but who would need that in raids? Or take flamethrower engineer, even after the improvements it's better to drop napalm and switch to something else that attacking a bit with Flame Jet to hit some adds.   
---
It's an encounter design problem more than a balance issue.  We didn't even need healing in instances until raids and fractal CMs, and even for those it isn't needed that much if people do their job right.
---
I'd say it depends. In the upcoming balance patch, they are pushing Elite Specs as trade-offs from the Core professions, but the Elite Specs are generally stronger than Core.
---
But it also depends on what you mean by Strong Meta. If you don't have HoT or PoF, you can't access Raids so that isn't a concern. In WvW, it would help but since it is generally team focused you should be able to get away with a Core profession. I'm not sure about PvP, but there probably are some good core builds that can compete. And for Open World and Dungeons, the Core professions should be fine; same for most Fractals but that may change at higher tiers.
---
Chances are, you'd want the Expansions for the content (new maps, raids, masteries, etc) before or just as much as you'd need them for the specialization. That said, if your account is Free instead of Core, buying an Expansion to unlock the rest of the Core features would probably be a bigger priority.
---
That is not a problem with raids however, that is your **choice**.
---
Just like you choose to do other things rather than raid. It's not a problem with how raids are built or anything.
---
Onto your other paragraph. I started with crossroads inn around the lake doric patch. I had a geared reaper but it wasnt a good class at all at the time. That didn't matter, I was welcomed into the group and if it was one thing I quickly noticed, it was that people have to leave mid run, and that is completely normal. But since so many extras sign up they usually only had like 6 groups going each raid night and a ton of other people who could sub in when someone left. Only putting in an hour isn't a bad thing. You might feel like it's not worth it to even bother for an hour, but again that's your choice.
---
I had connection problems all night
---
Waking up is the second hardest thing in the morning
---
I don't see why we should have to take orders from mice and talking cabbages!
---
I raid with my guild, We don’t usually pug for supports, preferring to ask for DPS because those slots are easier to fill and we can have our core members handle the support roles. We’ve been trying to pull off the hybrid comp (1 Chrono, 1 Quickbrand, 1 Alacrigade) but it’s difficult when our only Alacrity Renegade players are also our main Chronos. Asking for a pug to bring Alacrity Renegade seems like a tall order, but we’ll never turn away someone that volunteers to bring one, since it makes things easier for our core support crew.
---
Why? If i want to spend My life farming the sw i should be allowed to buy a Legendary with my gold
---
&gt; It was nice, but I did the story, learned what I could and didn't need anymore than that.
---
I'm sure you could find an hour or two sometime in the future to join a training raid and partake in the story as well. Even if you have to leave in the middle of a run people usually don't care. There tends to be more trainee's than mentors. So whenever a slot opens up someone **will** sub.
---
Other than that, yeah things do change. You have become a dad since gw1, but that doesn't really mean anything for the raids does it. The underworld would still be the underworld in gw1 if you were a dad back then.
---
It's basically your choice not to partake in raids. And you shouldn't blame the raids for it. I'm sure you can find some hour here or there where you do raids instead of your usual daily farm. I'm sorry if I sound harsh, I dont want to discourage you or take away from any of your real world duties, but yeah. Not playing raids is a choice you make.
---
Tbh I hope they buff base ranger then too. Still my favorite way to play them but they fall short in quite a few things compared to Soulbeast.
---
everyone
---
come!
---
Sounds awesome. When do I get one? Level 80 when I reach a dessert?
---
Fractals have a different composition, sure, but it is absolutely a great place to learn your profession/role and build the muscle memory to be able to focus on just the mechanics in other settings. Fractals also do offer a good chunk of mechanics to learn, but thanks to power creep over the years man of them we can kind of just blow through and ignore or phase faster than they happen :p whenever I pick up a new class I like testing it out in T4s or Recs before taking it to raids, but maybe that's just me.
---
Sometimes a new mechanic is just a new mechanic. I've seen posts about people getting stuck in story instances because they didn't grasp how an encounter worked. I'm not trying to say that to be dismissive of their effort, but just to point out that the perception of what's "easy" is different for many people. If you're not willing to go through trial and error to learn, or to reach out to others for assistance, I'm not sure what options are left. There's a threshold the devs have to cross which determines the difficulty of an encounter. Finding a way to compromise between a challenge and accessibility can be difficult in itself.
---
Figuring out that you have to send a person to do greens on Dhuum and that they're on a timer (and cool down per player) is a trial and error process for a completely new group. It is by no means an easy fight because a lot of it is just figuring out the mechanics on the go. How would you envision an easy mode of that fight which players could train in for the real thing?
---
Do you remove the big orbs to make collection easier?
---
Do the reapers get more/invulnerable HP to remove that consequence of failure?
---
Does failing a green deal damage to the reaper rather than killing it and the player?
---
Come to think of it... The game already has that kind of training mode! The Soul Eater, part of the three statue bosses required to access Dhuum, has a much more lax version of running greens. No big orbs to worry about, no reapers to babysit, and you can pick a player back up after failure. 
---
There are a few more things Dhuum introduces such as the Soul Split, Affliction (bomb), and Soul Link, but those are fairly more intuitive after a quick trial and error if you've already made it that far. 
---
Raiding is meant to be difficult. Pretty much every game with this kind of endgame content knows that it's something less than 25% of their player base is likely to interact with. While I understand and appreciate the empathy for the players who do not have the time to go through the paces to learn them, I'm just not sure how much you can trivialize an encounter yet still be challenging enough to warrant such coordination in a small group.
---
I'm not saying there shouldn't be an easy mode flat out. I'm questioning if such a thing would actually bring in more players and if it would be valuable enough to translate as training for the real thing. Is this a value-added bonus for Anet to work on, or would it be a frivolous effort to appeal to an uninterested audience? Looking at user stats for other games with similar content, as well as their own tracked stats for GW2 specifically, they have to ascertain if it's worth taking on the development of such a feature. After all, it's not like raids are generating direct revenue.
---
I know this is not how they feel, and it again sounds dismissive, buuuut if they're just worried they won't ever get to experience the lore aspect of the raids, there's always the option to look up videos for it. Just like there is to look up video guides for mechanics in a fight. 
---
Maybe the true easy mode would to make 1 raid wing per week open up as a world boss event thing for 40-50 people to zerg :p Could be a fun and silly way to do it
---
Perfect balance to me is there's a meta build that if you pull everything right then you'll be doing the highest damage/heal/support whatever it is. Then there's a little more forgiving build that does like 95% of what the meta build can do. It will be accepted by PUG because it can still do the job and some PUGs will actually prefer little bit more forgiving build since the output is more predictable rather than the meta build that requires no mess up. And then there's a build that's more forgiving but does 90% of what the meta build can do, and so on. Balance is broken when there's a build that no other builds can match when it comes down to complicity and value output ratio.
---
Give the text a 1px drop shadow and that'd actually be pretty damn convincing.
---
I can’t use any skills earlier I was standing outside a gate staring at team mates while on their screens they were in a lords room fighting I can’t go through portals pick up loot open bags in inventory
---
Meanwhile I am sitting here, really looking forward to the new Berserker.
---
The function of the trait is to reset air attunement CD on a crit. The "proc", extra fero, is when you attune Air.
---
Why the hell can I not get a mount until the end game? I might stop playing because of that. 80 levels of running. Who’s brilliant idea is that?
---
Now with WebRTC you can test for packet loss on your connection in your browser too with something like https://packetlosstest.com/
---
Chosen class and balancing for the viability of a great variety of classes have nothing to do with each other.
---
Also not entirely true. Core Mesmer is still a swiss army knife of utility, and useful utility. The problem is simple that everything is being measured by DPS/killspeed for T4 fractals and raids, and there quickness and alacrity reign supreme.
---
You can still deal damage AND have a full set of highly useful utility, you just can't compete with over-specialized niche builds like fractal and raid meta builds.
---
Core mesmer is more than fine everywhere else.
---
Yes actually. Maybe it was an update? O_o
---
From the POV of a casual: blah blah blah man, I can jump on whenever I want and pug T4s in an hour. I ain't committing to a specific time and timeframe to do raid content. Easy mode raids would mean I could pug a training group instead whenever I felt like it and work my way up to normal mode the way I did T1 T2 T3 fractals before T4.
---
The truth for a lot of us is that until we can learn to raid whenever we feel like it instead of set times we aren't going to. Criticise us for this all you want but in the end it means a lower raiding playerbase.
---
If you like to face tank like a boss you are going to love chrono.
---
While that's a nice sentiment to try and shake things up to make more space for different builds, the reason metas form is because content which requires a time investment which does not reward failure can be very taxing. 
---
Metas form up because people are looking for some assurance of a reliable experience. Is 100% 25x might necessary to clear an encounter? Nope. Does it help improve your chances to the point it's worth dropping another DPS for a dedicated might not? Yup! A meta is not a good or bad thing; it's just a thing. It's the result of working out a math problem.
---
So, shake things up as you will. A new meta will form up again. It's just the natural way players gravitate towards the path of least resistance. In a game like GW2 which does very little gatekeeping (in regards to built-in systems like gear scores or unlocking access), that meta becomes a valuable social tool for pugging.
---
&gt; I'm sure you think the "changes that should be made" are "revert berserker to summer 2017 state" but that's dumb as shit.
---
here's some advice: don't make too many assumptions about others, because if you end up being wrong, you'd end up looking dumb. you are wrong here, btw.
---
&gt; Current Berserker has barely anything distinguishing it from Core Warrior. You build them the exact same way and play them the exact same way: hit enemy until max adrenaline, hit F1, repeat ad nauseam.
---
you are also wrong here.
---
the strength of the current berserker is its unpredictability (in WvW. don't know and don't care about other modes). unlike base warriors, they have the ability to rapidly gain adrenaline, so quickly that opponents can't accurately predict when they are ready to burst.
---
in effect, berserkers trade some of their warrior sustain for unpredictability (or at least the potential to be unpredictable, depending on your slot skills) as well as some extra damage. its greatest strength is being able to unpredictably weave in and out of berserk mode, forcing opponents to second guess when and how to use their defensive cooldowns to counter.
---
&gt; hit enemy until max adrenaline, hit F1, repeat ad nauseam.
---
funnily enough, the upcoming berserker changes forces them to be exactly that: hit until max adrenaline, hit F1, repeat.
---
&gt; This new update actually does give Berserker its theme: unparalleled damage at the expense of survivability
---
berserkers are already that. the upcoming changes simply takes it to the extreme in the most unhelpful manner.
---
I bet they are going to come out with a sigil that increases range of skill by X.
---
What distinguishes it from other professions equipped with snb?
---
Ok, you can surely look the skins up. But here are some:
---
 
---
- Winter Monarch Outfit
---
- White mantle Outfit
---
- Light Inquest Vest
---
- Light Carapace Vestments
---
- Medium Krytan Jerkin
---
- Light (Human) Sorcerer's Coat
---
- Light Apprentice Coat
---
- Light Tribal Vestments
---
- Light Bladed Vestments
---
- Light Feathered Vestments
---
- Heavy Barbaric Coat
---
- Heavy Scallywag Chest
---
I'm sure there are many more that can be considered Cleavage. But I am grateful the Gw2 cleavage isn't the Hyper unrealistic No-Armor seen in Asian MMO's
---
It's a bit weird that they are doing this after saying they want daggers to be more 'mid-range aoe', but I almost must admit that you could hit people way far from the visible range of the whip, specially on smaller models.
---
I wish they had time to adjust all these combat animations that scale with the model to keep their proper range. There's nothing I hate more in combat than visuals that lie.
---
Yea that is what I thought as well, but I am not a necro main so I don't know how to quantify the crit chance in terms of shroud stay time and dps. I presume that reapers do the majority of their damage inside the shroud though, so the crit chance outside of it may be less important. Whether the loss of crit chance outside the shroud can be offset by the 10% damage I don't know for certain, but on first glance it may have some promise in Fractals due to extra crit.
---
Ah! :D I will wonder how you would present the edges of the art on canvas, paintbrush like fade or just make it go from edge to edge... So many ideas! O.o... I hope it turns out amazing for you. :)
---
Imao exactly not, maybe a precursor or the components but you would still have to add an account bound grind related/story/lore/achievement/earned through at legendary item directed gameplay component to craft "YOUR LEGENDARY". Its for me a flavoe thing and sad that leggies are only money and not skill/commitment gated. You can always buy gems, exchange for gold and buy a leggy off the tp and that for me is the main reason i hate leggies not being accountbound on acquire. Its Borderline pay to win.
---
GoE is GonE
---
I'm a returned player (last time was 2012 i think) only have basic game for now.   
---
is there a details guide on how to play the game using a ps4 controller? really details because i don't play much on pc.     
---
also i try reading on inventory system but it mostly it look paid. I get many gifts mails on my old characters that i can't open because of limit inventory.    
---
   
---
I want to try the game for a few days before buying the rest that i miss , so is there a complete version that have everything?
---
You still didn't mention what content. It sounds more like a problem with your guild than a general problem tbh. If your group is not going for speed records then power mesmer can be valuable. Dungeons are bursty content where you don't profit that much from chrono alacrity, power mesmer can have ok burst, you can help your group with invisibility, quickness on timewarp, skips, reflects and portals. What build are you using on your mesmer? You can't use the same gear as chrono as far i know, you need more assassin's pieces to cap crit chance, especially if you don't have ascended gear, most likely full assassin's. Some base specs are really not too bad for regular content. And anet is releasing a patch next Tuesday with the aim of bringing base and elite specs closer together.
---
Try to find some ppl who accept that you don't have the expansions.
---
It is the Idea of Elite specs, but you maybe haven't been there when they reworked the Trait system and when they introduced Elite specs in the first place. 
---
I don't blame you for your lack of knowledge, but you should inform yourself before Typing.
---
The company has the chat logs and OP casually didn't respond to the employee asking for his account name. I wonder why that is
---
I've also played around a fair bit with daze druid and don't really see why it's "rip".
---
You do not get a legendary (or an ascended weapon ala HoT) for completing POF, simply get closer to finishing a ascended backpack/unlocking more skins.
---
There's less traffic in the POF zones in general as they do not have as profitable an event structure, though there is still some traffic and also trains for bounties or HPs.
---
Funerary Incense bundle or something would be rad
---
If that’s the issue will other games also have connection problems? Will problems continue on other games on my PS4 as well? I haven’t tried any others yet
---
The thing about GoE is, that it was a Unique buff which made the class more interesting to bring, same with Renegade's Soulcleave S and Razorclaw R, it gives something to Squad members, that no other class can. Not this exact Buff.
---
sometimes but not always. gw2 might be a bit more sensitive for packet loss.
---
It's our equivalent of the druid pet damage nerf I guess :V
---
Ultimately it won't really change the way I play d/x builds, but I'll still feel it more than not at all
---
Ahh sorry was on the phone and didn’t really look at it
---
Ahh I actually think I know about that lol whoops
---
yeah, but not the choice of your guild mates.
---
&gt;the main difference is that pugging via lfg in gw2 was never the point to balance around and that it was made for static groups as they said on release.
---
Firstly, this is a mistake. It's not only possible, but easy to balance for both.
---
Secondly, static groups often need to fill a couple slots. 
---
Thirdly, While there are a few diehard healers / tanks who love that role with all of their hearts, I've also had to talk priests / rangers down from the ledge after asking them to heal for the billionth time when they just want to DPS. More viable specs / lower gearing burden to perform non-DPS roles helps spread the burden around.
---
&gt; the bosses itself already create different  dps scenarios, so you will never ever balance all classes at the same  level. its simply not possible. certain classes will always be better  then others even with streamlined dps where all have the same  theoretical dps.
---
This is fine as long as it very approximately shakes out. If DPS is balanced, but there are slightly better fights for melee vs. ranged  vs. power vs. condi that is perfectly acceptable.
---
Yeah it's that guild that was in the arp
---
My issue is that the XP needed is through the metas, mostly. I can't quite care to bother with another laggy round of DS or bothering to wait for another gate to get it's shit together in Tarir. Sure, it's fun a few times. God, 20 metas to get a mastery is silly as shit. Otherwise, I have to do the story. Guess what, the story only provides enough XP to level up about one mastery line completely (Hint: it's going to be gliding because of it's utility). Since LS3, the mastery point thing isn't an issue. I can just get the gold adventure rewards mindlessly with TacO, do LS3, and I have enough mastery points from all the content for HoT.
---
Well that settles it. We need a lineup of these ASAP
---
Glad to hear that gravity well and moa wouldn't be affects, since op's post scared me with flashbacks to some Samarog pugs. Hopefully the small changes will making Matthias just a bit easier since mirages sometimes had a bit of trouble with CC in the first phase.
---
5 man raids is Fractals.
---
You have the core game, so you have the whole base game, such as it is, sans expacs and Living Story 2-4. LS1, being temporary in game events, is no longer directly accessible, though there are videos you can watch. You can buy HoT and PoF bundled together, but you will have to buy the LS from the store in game.
---
You may wish to use /wiki and shift click the items in your inventory so you can assess what you need to keep, what you can bank, toss because it's no longer in use, etc. You will also probably want to make sure you have decent bags, to max out what space you have, and 18 slot bags can be bought off the TP for roughly 2g per.
---
If you want to get started on the stuff you missed with what you have access to, you should try out things like world bosses (teq and triple trouble come to mind), poke your head into Silverwastes (popular farming map) and perhaps try t1 fractals.
---
Kek
---
I love this! what's your twitter?? &gt;u&gt;
---
The holosmith specifically loses their f5, so that seems like the most plausible thing for the scrapper to lose.
---
How did anet nerf silverwastes? Was it relatively recent or old news? I personally dislike when they, not just nerf, but KILL very grindy methods to earn gold. Its as if they cater to casual playtimes.
---
Curious if necro WH5 actually got a nerf. It was changed from damage to lifesteal. Currently, pretty sure lifesteal doesnt get modified with ferocity, meaning it does its own damage with slight modification based on power/heal power. If this is true, it would mean casting the new version and going into shroud wouldnt actually increase dps.
---
If it heals through shroud, it might be nice still, even with lower dps. Would mean you can actually try topping up a bit/getting scholar without wasting time outside of shroud.
---
Interpreted it as "Another necro post meh " like necros are still hated literarily everywhere.
---
easy as ist you weird dude.
---
Fantastic job, love this artstyle! Keep up the good work!
---
"prevents downed allies from losing health while being revived"
---
Power chrono has crazy good burst for pve open world.
---
So how do you envision a "training" version of Dhuum then?
---
The way I see it, Eater of Souls is great because:
---
1. It establishes the importance of the orbs; You have to generate them *and collect* them.
---
2. It establishes there is a vital part to the encounter which is not oriented around direct combat.
---
3. It establishes how the "greens" are associated with friendly NPCs/ghosts which are present in the encounter and that you need to pay attention to their timers/spawning. There is a consequence for missing them (shockwave) and there is a cooldown preventing the same player from doing each one.
---
4. Orb collection is vital to the encounter. Failing to collect enough in time has a consequence, flying in the wrong spot has a consequence (out of bounds or into his suck/pull), and enough orbs must be collected in order to render EoS vulnerable to kill. Your movement while collecting orbs is important.
---
While, yes, there are added movement controls for up+down, it's more the same principle applied in Dhuum. The orbs are moving more than you are. And yes, in Dhuum you are not generating the orbs either so technically that makes Dhuum easier, right? :p
---
The purpose of a "training mode" would be to introduce core concepts that might otherwise seem alien in a more relaxed setting. I think EoS does a great job at teaching how to handle greens specifically without undermining the content itself *and* still being a recognizably different encounter.
---
What do you think would be a better way to handle a "training mode" for Dhuum?
---
You can still do those ones, though Palawadan is now a "one a day" affair rather than an "all day" affair.  Defending Tarir in Auric Basin is still worth doing, and you should try to camp an extra character out on the Matriarch platform to get a daily Amalgamated Gemstone from that fight.
---
Beyond that, it would depend on your personal goals.  If you're going for Dragonsblood weapons, do some Thunderhead Peaks metas.  If you want Elegy/Requiem Armour, roam around Jahai Bluffs and fight the Death-Branded Shatterer.  Gerent for Chak weapons, Dry Top for Ambrite weapons, Dragon's Stand if you want an hour-long brawl, the core world boss train if you just want to relax and turn your brain off, and so on.
---
And while it's not a meta, if you can gear up and dive into Fractals, those will be more rewarding gold-wise than anything else you can do at the highest ends.
---
Bruh you don't get a mount in WoW till 20, and not till 40 is it a decent speed. And you don't get the flying version till 60, much less upgrading *that*.
---
Do you want the game handed to you on a fucking silver platter or something?
---
Pof content is still more polished, just less of it. Reward structures would obviously change a lot of things, but content to content I enjoyed Pof a lot more, just there was more of it.
---
I hate repetitive tasks. 
---
I use different builds whose purpose is not be having a battle per node. 
---
I just take a minion mancer, walk node to node or mount and jump. The minions entertain the enemy I just attack upon arrival or leaving. 
---
The other build is a tough warrior, same purpose, arrive attack, farm nodes, attack leave, if someone else attacks the enemy dies, sometimes my attack kills, the main purpose is he won’t die easily.
---
Make raids 5 man.
---
r/whoooosh
---
As the other post mentioned, we were without mounts for five years.  On beyond waypoints, most classes have easy access to increased movement speed, either via a Signet that gives a 25% boost or the Swiftness boon that gives a 33% boost.  Both of those effects are comparable to the effect of mounts in other games, so just use one of those and pretend that you're sitting on top of some kind of animal.
---
The actual mounts that you'll get from the expansion are more than just movement boosts, they change how you move, letting you climb or float over water or teleport.  They aren't the mounts you're used to from other games.
---
You swing your melee weapon and it hits enemies that are really far.
---
No projectiles involved.
---
A ranger longbow buff/rework would be great...
---
Expected that answer and thats why i said borderline ;)
---
This is why people need to multiclass and not be one trick ponies. So they can actually have something else that's fun to fall back on and not endlessly complain when their favorite class gets the nerfhammer.
---
It's pay to flex, which is the main marketing strategy of every new modern game
---
So if you don't account bind the weapon, you don't get the weapon skin. OK.
---
The natural extention of this idea is why not have it so if you don't account bind the weapon, you can't select/change the stats?  And from there, if you don't account bind the weapon, why let you equip the weapon at all?
---
Why are you drawing a line right here at skins, but not at stat changing or equipping?  Is this actually the most sensible solution, or the one that suits you best?
---
GS4 burst is insane, especially if you pre-stack Might with stuff like Sword 5 and Mantra of Pain.
---
Agree with the other poster who replied, give it a week for a few people to stand in front of the dummy and declare the new meta comp, then everyone will only allow THAT instead and we'll be right back here.
---
I don't think there's a good solution, the game just doesn't teach people how to play in a group effectively and you don't NEED that until T3 fractals or raids - and by that point you have to force yourself to un-learn what you've been doing. I'm as guilty as anyone else, but the "meta" is a response to that because it offers the most padding to un-learn all those awful habits people picked up from 1-80.
---
Unique buffs should either: A. Not exist, or B. Be available on core classes as well as not be gamebreaking.
---
10% dps budfs available to one elite spec means that elite spec will be meta no matter what.
---
GotL was first and I was wondering why they didn't also kill GoE back then. Now it is finally kill.
---
Dagger weaver has a lot of stuns/dazes and slow cc’s so I don’t think being close to enemies will be an issue
---
I'd be willing to agree with you on some kind of partial refund system for those who end up in a situation like owning Nevermore and Bifrost, where they litterally can't use both.
---
But instead of skin changes or full resale, let me propose an alternative.  You use an Ascended salvage kit and get back Gift of Mastery and Gift of Fortune, while losing the legendary specific materials (The Legend and Gift of the Bifrost in this case).  Now you've recovered (roughly) half the cost, keep the skin, and can build a new (gen 1) legendary weapon.
---
Would that work for you?
---
This is so wrong Fractals T4 lack the amount of mechanics and coordination that Raids [require.](https://require.you)
---
I know right? I even went from the painful transition to Condi from Power. And dealing with the Headbutt and Arc Divider nerfs hurt, too. Finally some exciting changes!
---
Being in every modern game makes it a good phylosophy? Sry mate i think we have different ideas where pay to win starts and apparently my view of leggies in gw2 is more appealing to reddit hence the upvotes :/ lets see what anet will do, but im pretty sure they wont go back to s1 leggies and very sure they will not make leggies act like most cosmetic infusions.
---
The shaaadeeeee
---
I somewhat agree, but we are talking about *normalization* here, and how it mixes into *optimization*. If there are no unique buffs, that class which gives the most buffs for the longest amount of time while also bringing minimum anything else (be it damage or healing) is necessarily going to be the *only* class played by the majority, with "play what you want" only taking you so far, i.e, as far as you can go without giving up so that you can be allowed in groups as quick as possible without needing 9 other friends all the time.
---
So while boons have unique ways of being triggered by classes, truly *normalized* boons across the board would mean that anyone can fully stack said boons to more or less the same capacity (without getting into the skill involved - this could remain largely diverse). If that happens, we'll just move onto the next thing such as DPS or amount of healing, and if *everything* is equal, then even the gameplay itself has been reduced to some form of fashion wars.
---
I'm not necessarily arguing that normalizing unique effects is heresy and that by doing it to one or two skills is a slippery slope into doing it to everything, but on other hand, it does seem like Anet is intending to somewhat remove class uniqueness (actual, mechanical uniqueness and not merely getting the same results by pressing different buttons) up to the point where...I don't know, maybe they want people to be able to finally play what they want. I just wonder whether or not is there *even* a way of achieving such equality without completely butchering the mechanics they have designed, and that apparently have been working so well before Raids (even looking at more competitive modes like sPvP and WvW).
---
r/TheyFuckedUpTheMath/
---
Wait, I thought [Unyielding Anguish](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Unyielding_Anguish) was a leap finisher... Well I guess not! The description even has leap in it :
---
&gt; Leap toward the targeted area, creating a demonic field that torments and chills foes.
---
Maybe they could change that?
---
LOL - poor ele... they really out here trying their best ' = '
---
You can already do that
---
The ONLY Fluff post I have time for XD
---
This is correct.  You can make it and let it sit in your inventory indefinitely, still tradable.  When trying to equip/stat select, you're prompted to account bind it before you're allowed to continue.
---
This is exactly the problem we're having. The only people with any interest in pushing for the new comp are the Chronos. Both of our Chronos have fully kitted Guardians ready for healing, power, and condi quickness Firebrand variants, and one of our Chronos has a healing alacrity Renegade (me). 
---
But nobody else has (or at least, is willing to play) any of this. If we drop a Chrono, nobody can fill the Chrono spot. Nobody can step in with a Firebrand or Renegade. Our healers only want to play Druid or Scourge. There's one guy with a diviner Renegade, but he's busy during our static raid nights. Sometimes we mention it in our LFG posts if we're rounding out a spot or two with pugs, but not once has someone joined for the role.
---
We've been able to run Firebrigade maybe two or three times, and they've been some of our smoothest nights despite almost zero practice.
---
Why does this make you exciting? Don't you mean excited lol
---
I can't wait to see how it looks in game. &lt;3
---
I donno man, Dhuum is very much an encounter where the inaction or failure of one player holds significant consequence. Throwing more people at that specific encounter might have a more adverse effect than just lowering his hp and the damage in the encounter if that's your goal.
---
Doesn't matter if you bring 11-20 if a bomb blows up in the squad. Or if someone misses their greens. Or if he's tanked in a spot that makes it harder to safely get to a green. Or if the kiter fails to pull messengers / spiders aren't cleared.
---
It might compensate for a few other mechanical failures like losing people to dips, links, or even lines... Though arguably it could be a problem with splits because you'll have to make sure to comp for some more condi cleanse to deal with increased numbers. It could also help with clearing extra enforcers spawning from missing big orb I suppose.
---
You would also have to factor in the lag of having more people in a given encounter too — I know people who have a hard enough time with Dhuum with just 10 players due to older hardware :V
---
I you really feel that strongly about EoS not introducing mechanics which are used on Dhuum, I don't know what else there is to say on the matter.
---
There's also PS banner warrior as an option for might generation but I think raid pugs will keep one druid as it's so simple and stable to supply might as druid and there's still the spirits and spotter.
---
Come through education!!
---
Not even a mention of herald. I
---
Wish they would bring it back as it seems so support oriented, but unused outside of niche roles. It actually stacks booms really nicely if you are to use alacrigade
---
I'd say PoF was better quality, but lower replayability. I enjoyed exploring maps and playing through the story more in PoF than HoT, but after the first playthrough, I'd say HoT is better.
---
Like I rushed the PoF Story on release and by the time I finished, I had like 80% of all the Masteries done. Then when I finished last few things I missed in the maps on my way through, I was pretty much done the Masteries, making desert exp less valuable than HoT and Core where I still had Masteries to train. I spent a while working on the Griffon and some collections like the Banner. Then I later went back to hunt Bounties for Funerary and finish the Specialization Weapon collections, but now that I've done that it is hard to find things to work on in PoF. Meanwhile, I have caught up with most in HoT, but I'm still down to defend Tarir, fight the Mouth of Mordremoth, or help with some HPs for fun/loot.
---
Don't know why you're getting downvoted. That is the vernacular now.
---
" bUt iT's a BaCkRoNyM! " You mean like, a made up word that evolved from a commonly agreed usage and understanding? D: Like... all words?
---
I don't even get why everyone so adamantly highhorse-s that it's only short for metagame. Metagame doesn't mean what's popular either. It would mean, either, as a verb, to game with an awareness of the popular trends and mechanics, or as a noun, the awareness of the trend within that game. None of those definitions mean the trends themselves. So, used correctly, meta or metagame would never *have* meant "what is popular." Just playing or strategizing with the awareness of what's popular.
---
A lot of people USE the abbreviation meta to mean "What's popular in the game right now." (Which is an incorrect useage if you wanna be pedantic about the "metagame" origin.) And in the context of that abbreviation, spoiler alert, the tactics abbreviation is more suitable.
---
Also, because I keep seeing it other places, the idea that the pros can do something better doesn't prove that that's not what meta means. It means that casuals can't execute the highest level of the meta. It's the same reason training raids would run healing druids, not condi. Technically condi is more performant and you can squeeze more out of it. But if the players and the druid are learning, it's NOT the most effective tactic available for that group. The meta depends on the level you play the game at.
---
So yeah. In a gaming context, meta usually means Most Effective Tactics Available.
---
sorry english is not my native language
---
ISPs also deny all allegations of deprioritization, even when you come to them with proof
---
The fact that I'm forced to play support on my **Berserker** is one of the biggest gripes I have with Warrior Banners in GW2. 
---
I will thoroughly avoid using banners at all costs, which helps now that I don't raid anymore. In Fractals, people are usually ok with me playing DPS berserker.
---
Then there is mesmer
---
my only problem with the istan nerf is that it didn't touch the main problem, which is most of the metas being worth nothing because they dont give you anything of value
---
Some traits and stuff proc off of blocks so I think they're just removing the use of the "destroyed" condition to make the combat system more coherent in general.
---
Hard, you say?
---
Yeah. Among all of their attacks with a leaping animation none are leaps, all of them are blasts or combo fields.
---
And their remaining gap-closers are shadowsteps. Maybe they could give one or two leap finishers on those.
---
Well, I mentioned the other movement speed boosts in my post.  If a mount gives a 25% movement boost at level 20 in other games, then the Elementalist's Signet of Air or the Thief's Signet of Shadows are mounts that you can get at level 20.  Except they keep working in combat and have other effects too beyond mere movement.
---
To give some historical backstory, the Guild Wars franchise has always been very anti-mount, to the point of making jokes about it in the game lore.  The Hallowe'en festival adversary Mad King Thorn is the one notable character in the game who actually has a horse, that being Gum Drops, the Noble Steed.  Gum Drops is a fabled invisible pony.  That was the response of Arenanet to the players who complained that other online games had mounts but Guild Wars didn't, to make light of the situation by setting up quests surrounding an invisible horse.  Well, in fairness, they also made a lot of My Little Pony jokes around the quest too.
---
But yeah, in the meantime, equip the proper Signet for your class, or for classes without a movement Signet like Warrior, find the trait that gives a similar effect.  Warrior's Sprint is the trait in question for Warrior.  If you're playing a different class, let me know and I can tell you where your movement speed boost is.
---
Last time this happened I was on my selfish reaper build and actually swapped to meta scourge during the pre match. Only to get demolished on first push and have to ask two fights in to find out they were playing dps...
---
&gt;80 levels on foot is not a good feature.
---
It absolutely is, since the intent is to force new players to poke into caves or search for ways to climb up to a Vista.  They're meant to explore the "living world" and participate in active meta events instead of just sprinting through everything.
---
On your second or third character that can be a bit repetitive, which is why mounts transfer to subsequent characters once unlocked.  But forcing you to get to 80 *once* on foot is very sensible.
---
&gt;Mounts at 20
---
I think you're forgetting how fast the leveling curve is in GW2.  Level 20 is about 2-3 hours of casual play, and you're unlikely to have visited even a fraction of the maps by that point.
---
 &gt;less fast travel makes for a more immersive game.
---
I'm not sure which you're asking for here.  You want to get rid of waypoints because it's not immersive, even though it would reduce speed and convenience.  But you also want to have earlier access to mounts because it's faster/more convenient?
---
OP used to link to drive with the previous posts. Check their post history to see if it's still there.

Dang girl what kinda makeup you use I'm jealous 😍
---
Can I reedem these in Canada?
---
Quite often when you’re right you get downvoted on these subs 😄 
---
I used to think the downvote was for opinions that were off topic or abusive , not that people just didn’t agree with . At least that’s how I use downvote. I even upvote points I don’t agree with if it’s well written and well explained and adds to the discussion 🤷🏾‍♂️. 
---
but yeah, I agree with your analysis. Upvote to the moon !
---
Addressing things people aren't really talking about and missing many points here. I don't care about getting invested into "raids proper" I just want to experience the story connected to the raid and move on. If I wanted the gear or loot I would have already done that.
---
How is the pet dmg nerf on Druid random when one of the biggest complains about druid is that druid can just goes "trolololo you cant kill me ever" while the pet alone is enough to kill people?
---
If this is a reason to nerf Pets is debatable but random is not a word i would use here.
---
What you're proposing is that someone can just keep flipping legendaries depending on what they feel like at that time. Basically you're renting or leasing the skins for the price of one without investing the time it takes to acquire multiple so you can swap to something else with gold rather than a transmutation charge. Nah fam.
---
Geez... you're right. Christ I'm dumb. For some reason I just assumed it couldn't be because they changed it like all the others.
---
Because choosing the stats it's the main feature that make a Legendary weapon different from the ascended ones. It shouldn't come with a draw off (the account bound). Having multiple copies of a Legendary weapon by using its skin it's a plus, so it may come with a draw off (the impossibility to sell it back).
---
GS4 is my fav skill, no contest
---
&gt; Thing is even after nerfs both specs are still incredibly strong in most forms of PvE, but people are still gonna overreact ¯_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
Well yea. They were beyond busted when they were released, like a lot of stuff in both expansions. But no one likes having their class be nerfed over, and over, and over, and then again, and just add another nerf on the end, and finally one more nerf just to be sure. This is indicative of a huge failure on the balance team to identify these issues as the specs were designed, waiting far too long to actually address anything (if its fine for over a year like distortion sharing in raids, then **why** nerf it out of nowhere?), and then taking multiple balance patches to address anything fully.
---
That's why people are "overreacting", because this form of balancing is the least fun to play with.
---
Well, it could be ok for that specific case, but it's not what i was talking about. I'm just asking why we can't simply use a weapon and sell it back when we don't want it anymore. The answer is probably because of the skin System
---
Well of course. The idea of an easier difficulty isn't to trivialise the raids - it is to allow more space for players to learn and make mistakes but the absolute *basic* mechanics shouldn't change in either their lethality or manner in which they are dealt. If you aim to go down that route, then it is a "story" mode that is being sought.
---
&gt; It might compensate for a few other mechanical failures like losing people to dips, links, or even lines... Though arguably it could be a problem with splits because you'll have to make sure to comp for some more condi cleanse to deal with increased numbers. It could also help with clearing extra enforcers spawning from missing big orb I suppose. 
---
Yeah, that is pretty much why more numbers work and why the easier difficulties of raids in FFXIV and WoW have a higher number of players. If someone dies to their green, it allows for someone else to attempt the next one before the loss of players leads to a wipe.
---
&gt; You would also have to factor in the lag of having more people in a given encounter too — I know people who have a hard enough time with Dhuum with just 10 players due to older hardware :V 
---
I disagree with this statement for a huge number of issues, primarily that the main game mode of open world already has far more players involved so designing an easy mode around someone's old hardware that can't handle 10 man raids just feels like an arbitrary moving of the goal posts - seeking another reason why easier difficulties shouldn't be implemented rather than conceding that they might just be pretty useful for the entire community. Of course, if it is easier for health and damage to be lowered, then that may work too. I'm only throwing an additional idea out there instead of falling in with the negative crowd that don't want to see positives in letting the content be seen by more people.
---
&gt; I you really feel that strongly about EoS not introducing mechanics which are used on Dhuum, I don't know what else there is to say on the matter. 
---
That is kind of the issue with EoS being put forward as a "training" mechanism for Dhuum. For every similarity, I can point to a difference that makes it less useful as a learning mechanic. It isn't like the example of the trash before VG - each of those adds shows a mechanic that is replicated almost exactly in the VG fight and serves as a good way to introduce what the boss will do.
---
Maybe it's not good, but it works for doing money, so it's good for them
---
Everytime you list a Legendary the trading post eats a nice chunk of your gold. More, not all the leges have the same price.
---
= you can't flip without loosing money
---
Use ShareX instead
---
Incredibly grateful to you for recommending that. I have heard of Wooden Potats before and believe it or not, have watched a few of his shorter videos. The reason I specify "short" (a relative term when an average is 40 minutes) is because I can't stand his voice. I'm sure he's a lovely guy and he has a real passion for the lore, which I love, but I just can't listen to him for a prolonged length of time. 
---
That was a while ago though, maybe I'll go back and see if anything's changed. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
Exactly. If you're against easy mode, you're either:
---
* Living in a bubble, unable to realize different people have different experience in the game. If I don't need an easy mode, then no one else does either!
---
* An elitist who doesn't want "peasants" in their exclusive game mode, and still has the nerves to complain raids don't get enough developer attention.
---
* A raid seller who benefits from the current situation. You'd be surprised by how much money they make off people who can't get into raiding.
---
i would not make one right now just in case the new berserker build requires gear changes

well... [r/TyriaAfterDark](https://www.reddit.com/r/TyriaAfterDark/) is the place incase you ever start sinning ;)
---
for what it's worth, just tacking on minstrel accessories onto harriers armor/weapon is enough to get one started for wvw.
---
Yes, but the entire point of the dagger changes was to make it more viable and give it its own identity separate from sword mainhand. They made a bunch of changes to make dagger mainhand mid-range aoe, then... nerfed the range on air's primary attack.
---
It just seems like a weird choice to make. 
---
(And, aside from that, why does it matter how short sword's range is? We're not talking about sword. You could literally use "but sword's range is shorter!" for *any* argument about weapon range nerfs, and it would still have about as much to do with the conversation as the price of tea in China.)

And risk getting banned?

Very nice presentation. I wish I had a decent pc to play with this quality. Thanks for sharing.

Hey! Is the Necro slot still open? This sounds fun.

Sure, but in these situations no one knows or can even prove it’s a bad change.

Oh shit I missed or forgot that. My bad :(

One entire person said "server lag".
---
Good info in your post, it's just funny to read whenever someone thinks they have a minority opinion and it's really the majority.
---
Whips usually reach a distance of 15-20 ft from the person wielding it, so giving the Lightning Whip a range of 240 is one of the more ridiculous things I have read in a while from Arenanet.
---
&gt; You didn't Read My answers.
---
I don't care about your answers. You asked a specific question. I gave a specific answer.
---
Aren't ascended weapons account bound as well?  And exotics are soul bound?
---
Maybe legendaries should be different, but it's not really a drawback of legendary weapons if it's the same system every other piece of gear follows, is it?
---
So ah, I find myself in trouble.
---
You probably heard this story many times – haven't played for years, decided to return, forgot the password. Normally, not a problem. Except, I bought a different PC since. So NOW I need a serial code and a character name. Serial code, fortunately is in the mail letter from six years ago (Ye gads, SIX). The character name eludes me, though.
---
Is there no way for my friend to see the name of my character through their game? I did submit a support ticket but y'know... *Saturday*.
---
As long as you don't use words like bad or not good you should be fine when praising something.
---
Really nice fashion wars. Thanks for sharing &lt;3
---
*coughs in Mesmer*
---
That's only true if you merge. If you don't merge, you still maintain everything from core except that one trait line must be devoted to soulbeast, which is still a pretty decent trait line for general builds.
---
Not really. They don't offer anything that druid+chrono doesn't. We will have options.
---
If anything, I think optimal will be healer Renegade+Chrono+healer Firebrand with the option of going dpa on Firebrand or Renegade and taking other healers.
---
Open meta.
---
Woho we have a menstruated braindead here!
---
who are you to tell them the best way to design accessibility? we're all just randos in a discussion on an internet forum sharing from our points of view :V
---
and to be fair I did say *sometimes*. Some encounters are pretty straightforward and you can jump right in and piece together what's going on. Some encounters you're probably going to fail multiple times just trying to establish what's wiping the group. Some encounters you'll probably learn the "wrong" way as you clear it the first time and then only after weeks/months you discover a significantly better way of handling the encounter.
---
I'm of the opinion that it's an individual choice if you want to participate in raids or not. By design they are a heftier time investment than the rest of the game. By design they are a much more challenging experience which demand more out of you than the rest of the game. If the argument is that they take up too much time and are too difficult, it's a matter of what the developers want it to be vs. what the expectation is and any adjustments made will stem from that.
---
That's not to discount the desire of "I want to do raids!" and then feeling as if you cannot *because* of the time/difficulty constraints. It's just an objective assessment of what they are. Some people simply won't have the time. Some people simply have a much lower skill ceiling. If raids are a crucial part of player retention models, then the developers would be wise to adjust to accommodate to their audience to reach acceptable engagement rates.
---
I'm not going to tell you to go do training runs if you think you lack the time to participate in them. They're just another option that exists for approaching this content. If you want, you can study the mechanics through video or written guides to become familiar with them and then just try to jump into a normal group. There really isn't much in the way of stopping you from doing so.
---
If you'd rather not go through the struggle of failing or learning through trial by error, I suppose you could always pay for raid clears as well. There are plenty of guilds which offer pretty quick/reliable clears while carrying through one or two individuals who just want to experience them once or work on collections for their legendary armor. There's a bit of a stigma to it I suppose, but it's just another option to achieve your goal within your RL restraints.
---
Luckily for newcomers to the raids, there are people who have been running this content for literally years and they can offer a great deal of insight. When I first started raiding (about a year ago) I was relatively worried/anxious because I felt like I was going to hold the group back. I was more than experienced with multiple roles in the scope of fractals, but I felt like I just didn't have the time to go through the steps of learning them (or the desire for that matter). Eventually, I decided that I wanted to work on the legendary armor and that's what compelled me to finally dive in.
---
From my experience as someone who taught others in another game, I looked around for training services and then one weekend when I had nothing else going on, I joined. I asked questions about mechanics or things going on that were ambiguous and people answered in kind. Again, I'm not going to tell you that training is the answer because for some people they'll never know it exists or just lack the desire, time, or reason to do it. It's just one of the resources available and I took advantage of.
---
What I'm getting at here (tl;dr:) is that I think that the anxiety factor plays a pretty big role for people. They overhype the difficulty and time investment required for these kinds of things and there are plenty of resources available to brush up on the encounters at this point.
---
Not really try to praise them. I'm just excited for the upcoming patch.
---
I dunno, I've been running mine through LS4 and it's rather challenging in places. Druid just isn't tailored for non-group content, which is a shame because they're so cool thematically.
---
I think you're confusing "meta" with "minmax"
---
A "meta" is more about a guideline to work off of. Not sure about what build or composition to use? Why not see what other people have had success with! The idea is that by following a template of sorts, you better improve your chances at success. 
---
By your definition of having people with perfect DPS rotations, positioning, not dying, and throw in phasing bosses quickly enough to bypass mechanics (which should be the case with perfect dps), you'd be kicking a whole lot of people and swapping players out per boss. I have yet to see any pug group do something like this. The only time something like it has come up is when a W4 pug starts without recruiting a HK and has to replace someone in the squad to pick it up.
---
A bad player using a meta build is still a bad player. What makes you think they're going to be guaranteed a spot over a good player on a less popular build?
---
Though there's also the people who *think* they're good at their class but really are not. I had a 4k DPS Slb show up to MO CM who swore they were being persecuted because they were on a dps ranger and that if they were a healer then people would have left the alone. We were probably 4 pulls deep at this point and they seemed to be having trouble with blues on top of their dps. The other Slb in the group said "they seem okay with me though" and then the 4k one left without getting kicked :V
---
Meanwhile, fellow male diva band Charz 2 Men are still struggling to find an audience
---
I'd be more interested in a Story Mode than an Easy Mode. Recently I've been doing a story playthrough with some friends from Zhitan to current. To recap some of S1, we did the S1 Fractals and that was a bit of a struggle for them. I know there is a good bit of White Mantle Story in the earlier Raids and I'd like to have included them, but I know they wouldn't be able to do them unless we got carried super hard. My only raiding experience was when my Guild did Gorseval; that took us like 4 hours and it probably would have been longer if some guild mates didn't have to leave and got swapped out for Raiders from out of our Guild. One of my friends doesn’t even play with a mouse (don't ask me why...); there is no way he is going to find any success in Raids. And the worst part is there aren’t really good recaps of what happens in the Raids; I've read the story off the wiki and such, but I've yet to find a quick video that sums up the important plot stuff that would have been relevant to S3.
---
That said, I do agree that an Easy Mode may not be needed and that it can be difficult to scale it back to make it easier. But I think there could still be value to a Story Mode for players who aren’t as interested in doing Normal Raids and just want to try the content.
---
&gt;What sort of easy mode do you think would help "teach mechanics" though? If the mechanics are succeed or wipe but the rest of the run is trivial damage, that's already available by stacking healers. 
---
Then we deal with the problem directly, healers.
---
To encourage playing the wiping mechanics, the mechanics that would wipe the entire squad, would inflict something like [agony](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Agony). This will reduce the healing so you have more time to survive mechanics but you can't ignore mechanics by stacking healers.
---
* Raid-agony will also be a way to convey information clearly to the players that this mechanic will wipe you in hard mode if you ignore it. 
---
* For Damage over time mechanics, it would inflict only Raid-Agony until whatever mechanic is finished. For example, Standing on VG's damage fields will do Raid-agony + less damage until you get off of it. You have more time to survive running back to the group, but you cannot stand on the VG's damage fields forever and survive even with healing. 
---
* For one-shot ko attacks that player has to dodge/avoid, Bosses will instead deal damage equal to 50-75% of the player's hp and then continuously inflicts Raid-Agony + DoTs until the player dodges or goes downed. This will convey information to the player that this attack will hurt you if you do not dodge it. Players are encouraged to dodge before the one-shot ko attack to avoid having 25-50% less hp and raid-agony. For example, Sabetha's flame wall will not kill you, but you will learn quickly that you don't want to touch it. 
---
* As for learning about mechanics that squads has to succeed or wipe, it will differ. For easier/easiest difficulty there is no wipe or timer. But instead, bosses is invulnerable until the players figure out the mechanics. For example, Sabetha cannot be damage until the bomb is thrown at the right direction. For the harder-mid difficulties, if the squad fails, every raiders will get huge damage + temporary raid-agony and has to deal with it. 
---
Easiest mode would not have raid-agony and should be wipe-resistant. Anyone can join with any build and ignore almost every mechanics. Its there to get the player's feet wet in raids even if they are not ready to swim. It is there to reduce their anxiety about being a burden to the group. It is also there to learn what the boss looks like and what the aoe spams and attacks he can do even if you don't know what attacks hurts. 
---
Raid-Agony will only appear between Easiest and Hard mode difficulty.
---
The true sin is taking away the hover on Magnetic Leap. Yeah D/D ele is still mobile as heck, but I'll surely miss the ability to raptor jump in Fractals and JPs.
---
But they are doing some changes and so far i believe everyone is welcoming to the changes. Hopefully there are more to come to fix old traits and utility skills.
---
Like someone already said, projectile destroy fields didn't destroy unblockable ones before anyways.
---
I understand that but thats no reason to make a new post on reddit about it. If you want to express your excitement here, use the existing thread about the balance patch on the front page.
---
I mean, regular raiders should have it easy as they can just pick up the mangetite gear. And fractal runners can pick up trinkets for integrated matrices + relics, and diviners rings only cost laurels :p.
---
But yea, newer players (or ppl that are otherwise cramped on these resources) will have to farm quite a bit indeed.
---
&gt; Charr. They distrust spellcasters. There's still plenty of magic users within the legions, but they will have a hard time living there and finding people who will trust them, particularly elementalists. Most mesmers and necromancer back in the day of the Shaman caste were part of the Ash legion, so they are likely to be more lenient with spellcasters, but most elementalists were part of the shaman caste of the Flame legion, so they are often seen with suspicion until they prove themselves.
---
note that a lot of olmahkans seem to be elementalists; if you go off headcanon over personal story
---
I'll just delete it then
---
I don't normally do this, but it doesn't seem like a bad idea. New fractal explorers can't access those sections of LFG.
---
So you dont post on the forums out of fear of being banned and consequently not being able to post?
---
3 hours only if you have a very experienced and good group.
---
For instance, my guild group runs two days, three hours each, we get about 4 wings done in that time, and we are by no means horrible. Average, maybe. To be fair, we can't kill Dhuum no matter how hard we try and same for Twins, so even at our very fastest we could only get 19 kills, including stuff like Escort, River or Twisted Castle.
---
Quickbrand can easily be condi, me and friends have been theorycrafting condi alacgade but it would have such high energy usage that we're unsure (power really only needs to autoattack and throw a skill here or there). Regardless alacgade doesn't contribute super much dps, so it's fine if it doesnt perform optimally damage-wise on certain bosses.
---
Yes, you are right.
---
Or even easier: [http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/hardlinkshellext.html](http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/hardlinkshellext.html)
---
yeah, otherwise mods here will probably do it
---
But that's just the thing: it's a guideline, but it isn't treated as one. People bring a meta role and EXPECT everyone else to do the same.
---
The whole gameplay revolves around the idea of a raid being done in a specific way. Healer scourge was unthinkable until it hit metabattle, and that's the same for basically any builds that later found their way into that content.
---
Yaaas. Gonna make my 5th necro this week. A reaper Woot woot
---
We traded half epidemic for it =[ lol
---
&gt; if its worth the buy? 
---
&gt; I've really enjoyed 
---
Isn't that enough as an answer?
---
Healer scourge was seen as non-optimal because you're trading boons for safety nets on failing (or ignoring) certain mechanics. It's built around. If I'm remembering right, the reason it got popularized was because a content creator put out a video showing how easy it was to patch up mistakes with it and paired that with a reminder that you don't *need* 100% alac/quick/25might/fury uptime to clear a boss.
---
It's still considered non-optimal for several encounters, but at the same time it's definitely gotten a bit more popular for things like healing VG, hybrid MO (epi), healing (+stripping) Largos, and general sup on Qadim. It's still not recommended to run more than 1x of them, but yeah.
---
The meta is more about setting up a template to work with. x many dps, y many support, z many utility. DPS tends to have the most flexibility in regards to comping (aside from power vs condi fights), but support roles generally require more planning because the rest of the comp is based around that. Building a framework around 2x chrono 2x druid and 1x BS was just an easier way to solve the problem of finding players with the right builds to start a run. Flexing out the second druid was always an option, though they were definitely the most sought after.
---
It’s definitely off topic but the sword range can be very annoying, if you don’t use fire/air 2 or ride the lightning before using other skills you can burn them needlessly.  Especially sword air 3 which goes onto cooldown even if it doesn’t proc on an enemy.  Or if you are on sword/dagger and use air 5... you knock the enemies out of range, and they are like 2 feet in front of you.
---
You’re right though, just chimes in to vent :)
---
So did mine! Then I picked it up and popped that sucker right back into place.
---
I encounter those people 9 in 10 times when pugging.
---
I believe they should be blocked. Unblockable projectiles still go through. 
---
A lot of traits proc when blocking an attack so this sounds more useful and coherent than just destroy them.
---
gw3 is as likely too happen any time soon as HL3
---
Literally any boss if you use 2 healers or can make a soulbeast take spirits.
---
https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/hybrid-firebrand  
---
Yes.   
---
There's also a healer Firebrand build (where FB provides the healing instead of the REN) but that's a net dps loss, and less popular as well.
---
I list recs in t4 because I just want it done smooth and fast.
---
An advantage of easy mode raids is that when more people play the content, it's easier to justify development time. ANet's reason for de-prioritizing development on plenty of the game's content (instanced content, guild missions, guild halls, pvp) is that "not enough people do them to justify the resources".
---
I'm Living.
---
I think OP is asking why they are waiting for someone if they can easily finish it with 4.
---
PoF was nowhere near the same in terms of shittiness though. PoF has less lasting power, but that was to be expected when you go from an expansion full of map-wide metas (pretty harsh at first, but really have a long tail) to one that barely has them.
---
If you're in a guild with your friend they can see your last character's profession and level but no names. Your best bet is to just wait for support to reply, they should have other options besides character name.
---
*pinch your cheek*
---
F u klaw :D
---
If GW1 is still canon, ears are [Secondary Sex](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Oggy) traits for Asura
---
To throw my hat in the ring - YES! Life is short, enjoy the games &lt;3
---
Honestly, the game is so much fun. There's so many different things to do in the paid version and most all of them are incredibly fun.
---
I'd say go for it!
---
Yep! :)
---
I think you need to account for the marked differences in the community's attitude. From what I've heard, FF14 is less casual so the harder content would still get played even with easier options. Also GW2 raid rewards are mostly a quantity and not quality system. The best value is doing all the bosses you can do easily, not doing the hardest ones for rolls on the best stuff
---
IF you check metabattles, both [mesmer](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Mesmer) and [ele](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Elementalist) have viable core builds for most game content.
---
You won't have the versatility of someone with the elite specs available to them, but you won't be completely useless by any means - particularly in PvE content. You can do just about any build you want for open world stuff, and the same goes for dungeons or low level fractals.
---
You can't do raids without the expansions, so no need to worry about those. So the only things you'd need to worry about your build in would be T4 fractals and PvP/WvW. Even then, playing well with a mediocre build will take you much further than playing badly with a "meta" build.
---
So as long as you put in the time to learn you should be fine even with those core builds and no elite spec in the content that's available to you. Unless you're really worried about performing the best you absolutely can, then you're going to need the elite specs.
---
Those ran away.
---
OP asks for "lorewise", and in lore characters are always the commander, and have fixedbackstories.
---
It'd be neat if we could make an Olmakhan, or a non-legion charr born in LA, but we can't. The most players can do is saying it they are that, like when people RP.
---
I agree. I love PoF maps, they're unique and beautiful. But as far as the first months of PoF, I haven't stepped foot in again. It's lacking compared to HoT when it comes to meta events chain.
---
Till this day, scribe is not for everyone.
---
Steve said so
---
I primarily play it for the exploration. GW2 has some really, really excellent maps. Even the core maps are really fun to navigate for me. Everything from the design to the events to the enemies makes it really enjoyable to me.
---
Generally speaking, I'm a big fan of the larger and more dynamic maps. This includes Draconis Mons (probably my favorite), Verdant Brink, Crystal Oasis, Siren's Landing, Jahai Bluffs, and Elon Riverlands. I find these to be the most enjoyable ones.
---
Now if only griffon and the new mount can use updraft too. Lol
---
Rip druid.
---
Too many people suffer from tunnel vision. :/
---
I personally love the story and living world model. I enjoy games that make you feel like part of a world that consistantly progress and change. The beautiful maps also help with that. That's probably unusual though considering how many ppl on this sub hate the story...
---
No official comments regarding GW2, but consistent comments saying that there is a lot more to come for GW2. I'd say we're maybe roughly halfway with the game. Many years ahead, so come and join the ride!
---
Me spending any amount of time practicing my rotation doesn't guarantee that the rest of the group would have done the same.
---
And even if it did, wipes are caused by failed mechanics, and pretty much never by bad rotations.
---
i wish the would take a deeper look for combo mechanics, currently the are just abandoned, but they could do so much more with it
---
yeah, caring for Hitler
---
The black-redacted marks form the shape of an F. I’m assuming to pay respects. Smart.
---
Sincerely doubt there will be a GW3, maybe ever.
---
They shut down their side projects to focus on GW2 for the time being, sure a company can't be a one horse show. But for me it makes no sense to force people away from GW2 into GW3 when GW2 still has a lot to stand on. It's literally getting better by the moment. Creating competition for themselves = stupid beyond belief.
---
Anet starts to give every Elite Spec a downside.
---
This is the downside for Druid.
---
thanks, im just here for the roleplay
---
Thank you for your very well written &amp; courteous reply. I totally get what you're saying. They were designed to be hard, they were designed to be tough and perfect for guild content.  
---
Totally understand everything you said and I completely agree. 
---
I don't think I articulated myself as well as you did but I'm glad you understood my points.
---
I don't want a story mode to take away from anyone or the development time, raids were advertised as end game and they need to stay that way. I just want all the story content and lore I can get!
---
Meanwhile as a Necro main I'm still here wondering when I'll stop getting told to stop playing Necro in PvE, much less when they will be meta.
---
Heck, with GoE removed, you probably don't need spirits for a power comp. Sun is still nice for condi teams, but otherwise there's very little reason to not take Ele over Druid as a single healer in 10-man content.
---
GIVE US THE TWITTER!
---
I play for exploration of Tyria, easily the most artistically beautiful and believable MMO world out there, fun massive meta events and fractals, and for the story, which, in combination with the lore, is pretty interesting to me. I enjoy levelling new classes, playing with friends, joining in on the multiple ingame festivities, and completing the occasional achievement.
---
You can be sure Druid will still be able to get the job done. Simply because how little challenge fractals actually have to offer. Taking some more healing might not be the minmax way, but it can actually save time on groups that aren't "90th percentile". Which, by definition, are 90% of the groups.
---
Unblockable steal means nothing, you already strip aegis, and if you need to go throught true blocks, you had Basi venom. 
---
The 600 range means Daredevil is dead for sPvP. Simple as that.
---
Nah it is is currently perfectly aligned with the principle of consistent inconsistency.
---
It's like all the skills where you get hit with the negatives of being a projectile but get none of the positives.
---
Adding an easy mode would hardly hurt the release schedule when it can be as simple as a global incoming damage reduction and lower boss health.
---
Forced into 600 range steal is a deal breaker for how Thief is played
---
Omg. I'm glad they tweaked the designs. Those look awful especially the shield. Lol. I just spent all my ascended shards for the new shield skin. Wish they were less pricey though.
---
Idk what to tell you man, the best possible comp on almost every boss was firebrand renegade soul beast chrono. That’s just a fact l.
---
I hope that you check it out sometime, there is a lot of trainings hiding everywhere, wether it be discord communities or guilds doing impromptu runs.
---
I do think you should treasure your family before gaming. But if you just have an urge one day I do urge you to try it. Or atleast look at YouTube videos who pick apart at the more (woodenpotatoes for example). Because while it isn't essential it still is well written and I do like the raid narrative myself. And if it's one thing I've learned it's that people watch let's plays etc all the time, and it's not really any different from me handing the controller to my older brother as a child when I got stuck in a game. I. E. You don't have to play it just to get the story. But I would recommend that you try it some time in the future.
---
Just remember there is no rush to do any of it. Since we don't have gear threadmills etc the raids will forever stay viable.
---
I’m not so sure scribing is for everyone yet lol.
---
Thanks! I’m maining an engineer currently and love it.
---
[removed]
---
so I see they are taking the Massive route, instead of making the unviable viable, make the viable unviable.
---
𝓦𝓸𝔀, 𝓽𝓱𝓪𝓽'𝓼 𝓺𝓾𝓪𝓵𝓲𝓽𝔂 𝓪𝓻𝓶𝓸𝓻!
---
There are two ways to answer that questions:
---
The "yes" answer states that having more specializations means more possibility, and more possibility is indeed an advantage to those who purchased the expansions. On some classes specializations almost plays in a different way than the core and its a different gameplay experience.
---
Plus, META will always be META. The best builds will always take the endgame player with every expansion available. unless ANET decides to create some sort of Raid that restricts specializations, no one will make a Core build meta.
---
In the "No" answer is that specializations and core classes are more than often balanced equally. It's indeed common for ANET to nerf core traits but that usually happens when they want to tone down a class as a whole.
---
In ALL game modes there are still Core classes that are viable, as well as Core classes that are just slight weaker than their specialization version of the build. Not META, but still GREAT.
---
So its pretty common to find Core builds even among META and Great builds.
---
Keep in mind tough, even tough the affirmation above is valid for all game modes, including SPvP and PvE, you have to take in consideration that PvE-wise the only place that people really care about your build is Raids. And raids are not available to players without expansions.   
---
So the only real PvE content that you have to worry about is Fractals T4. That was initially devised for Core Builds.
---
SPvP is simpler since there is no grind involved. Just research the core builds that are meta or great and create a char from that class and use then. It's NATURAL that not every Core class is viable, but since we are talking about a competitive mode it SHOULD make sense for a player without expansions to create char with classes that do work, right?
---
Core Builds come left and right on PvP tough. Core Thief is still strong, as well as Core Guardian, Core Ranger and Core Warrior. Core Engie and Core Necro, sadly, are two core classes that you probably don't want to even try outside study and practice.
---
their fault for missing the big red text that says team comps haven't been updated yet, i guess.
---
inertia is a powerful thing and you'll get downvoted for daring to imply 2x chrono 1x druid is no longer the meta everywhere.
---
It just feels so "wrong"!
---
They are not worth it. I would recommend glue sniffing or cocaine instead, you'll get a lot more playtime out of that
---
I personally always go laurels as there is no other way to get them other than from dalies.  Everything else can be obtained some other way.  Plus if they keep adding skins that require laurels to buy the recipes (i.e. the thunderhead keep ascended set) you will always need them for something if you want them.
---
I'm just happy that I can logically use Soul Eater over Decimate Defenses in Pve when the patch comes.
---
I'm torn on whether or not that should be the case, but either way I think that ship sailed years ago. If I was to design the class over again but still include pets as a part of it, I would move the bulk of the damage to the ranger itself and leave pets as utility with the player in better control over both their skills and the class' overall damage. As a result of that the pet pool would also have been slimmed down. A beastmaster build with emphasis on pet damage will never happen anyway, so killing the potential of running that is irrelevant. Druid would benefit from it, while soulbeast could still function somewhat the same. 
---
But, given we're almost 7 years into the game's lifespan and pets are still.. problematic, I think I would prefer a different class mechanic entirely.
---
Really sorry about that man. In one of my now dead I guess fair to say guilds, we had one asshole who didnt even raid sit in raid lfg and recruit people. 40 people in two days once.   How do I work with that? After a month of not even being able to try  people more than once I just kinda broke. I got a few more hour stories from that guild but damn man, being a raid trainer is a thankless headache nightmare and it sucks we can't really help the people that actually want to step up because there's so many people we'll see for maybe 12 hours of failure "last long in november 2017."  Really sorry you had to go through that
---
I loved the thief dagger/dagger skill 3 slow mo part, I have been trying to take a screen of mine doing that exact movement but I can't manage to capture the character in the middle of it, it always ends up out f frame or somethin, seeing this in your video has made my day XD
---
I played with my friends due to good pve 5 man content. But because anet cant deliver anything but open world, we dont really play anymore
---
I feel this pain. I got locked into playing chrono for raids early. Im at the point that i make mistakes because im falling asleep from the tedium. I want to do something new, i want the chance to play something stupid.
---
No, because VG trash doesn't mislead you with *incorrect* ways to do things, unlike EoS where you normally send up multiple people (you don't on Dhuum), your group forces orb spawns (not on Dhuum) and the movement is entirely different.
---
Absence of mechanics doesn't instil incorrect ways of doing things. If you wanted trash that did *every* mechanic together, well, that is what the boss is for and your specific argument is poor - getting teleported on VG doesn't necessarily send you into a field of damage either. However, yes, VG trash could be thought of as simplified VG mechanics.
---
I'm not sure why this is coming back to EoS again and again when it really isn't a good surrogate for learning Dhuum. That I can keep pointing out such numerous differences and keep finding others should be a sign of that.
---
I agree that increasing the number of players may not be the best solution but it is something that is a quick and easy alteration to implement. No need to scale boss health, to change how many people need to do particular mechanics, no need to change damage or tone down certain abilities. There are probably better ways but for something that is quick and effective to implement, and backed with evidence from other games, it would work fine.
---
World vs World!!
---
first of all, I don't think ffxiv is less casual - on the contrary, it's incredibly welcoming for new players, at least for the normal (story) mode encounters. and that's the main difference, as players don't feel scared to join a raid, it simply has some mechanics that might kill them, but even in the rare event that I completely fucked up a mechanic with the result of wiping the raid, nobody berated me, they just wrote a 1-liner of how I should avoid the mechanic next time. obviously I didn't test them by failing another 20 times, but anyone with half a brain can join ffxiv raids and succeed, whereas the same can't be said about gw2.
---
I don't think ffxiv did anything revolutionary, they simply learned from old mmos and made what they thought the best possible game. gw2 has, by miles/kilometers, the best combat system I've ever seen, but they don't make use of it. the solo player instances are fun once, but then they are irrelevant. ffxiv seems to have made everything with the goal of connecting veterans to newbies, and it certainly shows.
---
*Cries in Mallyx*
---
roul is part of SC so i'd imagine he's a lot more updated on the actual meta than you and i.
---
you're telling me you know better than him, even though he's been in actual meta runs? i mean, i wouldn't be surprised if your comment ended up screenshotted and posted to a discord to be laughed at.
---
Oh god, I'm too ghey to go there.
---
What drew in at the very beginning was exploration, and the ease with which I could jump into the middle of an event with other random players, and then leave on my own solo journey right after. I felt like I had a lot of freedom.
---
After leveling a few characters to 80 and having explored most of the core maps I got an invite to a guild. Really friendly group that introduced me to discord, to guild missions, to the expansion map metas, and to other group content. They’ve kept me engaged and interested thereafter.
---
I also started setting personal goals, like having every elite spec unlocked, having 9 fully ascended characters, clearing raids with my guild, completing every map, unlocking as many skins as possible, fully furnishing my home instance, and so on and so forth.
---
I don't know how to mark a post as \[Fluff\]
---
This is a screenshot from my mesmer.  He *really* doesn't like helping people.
---
probably not optimal, but assuming stacking renegades on dhuum,
---
what about having two renegades take righteous rebel. one in each subgroup; and replacing the chronos with condi quickbrands?
---
MY guess: We get a middle range weapon next elite spec,  i am hoping for GREATSWORD baby!!!!
---
Heres what I want. To be a nigh immortal destroyer of the pve. Make me become a god in guild wars 2. Make me feel powerful in the end game.
---
I like the open world. Achievements, explorations, random chats with other players. This game helps me relax after an exhausting day. I never have to worry about falling behind if I can’t play for a month. And I love the story, looking forward to the living world episodes.
---
Thank you!  I was absolutely dedicated to not helping the locals with their spider problems or lighting their signal torches or whatever.  I’m the commander of the Pact, and far too important for such trivial tasks.
---
But you can put necro wells underwater!
---
If it's not meta in T4/raids, it doesn't exist. Goddamn tunnel vision indeed.
---
Reason I play changes almost every year. There is so much to do that even if I exhaust my current goal, then I can find another.
---
Fist I played for exploration, then for story. Some time later I played to max out all classes. After that I spent a year on endgame dungeons and raids. Later I focused seriously on pvp. Another year and I came back to exploration and legendary crafting.
---
Can't wait to see what's there next for me
---
This is problematic since there is a Balance update coming Tues Apr 30. However currently: https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Spellbreaker_-_Strength_Dagger
---
Each person have their own reason and choice of what they play in this game. And that is the whole point. You choose exactly what you want to play for the day. There is no must around it. There is nothing you have to do. There are not raids that are must to get bis gear you can craft it or do WvW or PvP or fractals. You don't have to do PvE if you are a WvW player and want to open up your elite specs. You wont be able to gank people in PvP because your gear is better, you gank them because you are better then they are. Skills matters. Or you can do story or jumping puzzles or adventures every day. Or only play WvW. Or everything. 
---
It is your choice. And that is why GW2 is good, you play what you want to play with your time limits and even if you take long breaks your bis gear will still be op when you come back. You might have to stat swap but it will still be the op gear because we do not have the gear tread mill, nor 5 more levels on each expansion.
---
Or instead of giving the person more attention here on reddit you could like sent it to exploits@arena.net and asked them if they feel this is ok. 
---
But i guess giving trolls more attention was a better choice, heh?
---
Thank you so much, take a look.
---
To me that is the truly sad part. People treating/playing GW2 like every other game. One of  the game's selling point for me was the more ad hoc approach to tackling group content. Instead people have gone largely in the complete opposite direction. :/
---
Fortunately for me I play mostly with friends and we just bring whatever we feel like.
---
"Thanks"
---
I totally agree with, but heal scourge is not out of meta; it's a hard carry if u have the right composition ( firebrand,...) and the barriers do their job
---
I play almost only heal scourge in fractals and raids
---
That's what training runs are for though.
---
If you like the game, IMO you should support it.
---
Is there any other type of Asura?
---
Sounds like you're mostly doing overworld PvE. Condi Mirage is aimed at PvP and bosses, boon Chrono is aimed at raids. Regardless, Mesmer can solo all PvE content because clones tank, so to get the most bang for your buck, Power Chrono is the correct choice here.
---
Nevertheless, Mirage is more fun by far. While gearing for boon Chrono, I ran stock 'zerkers, dumped WvW Testimonies into Mirage line, and had a freaking *BLAST*. I cannot in good faith recommend [this build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQNAsaRnELDlphFoBmoBMMjFVDrsDUCGA+FwFYEkMAMCKOA-jhCHQBhRHwaVCiW1KGwhAgfPAgWs/AAODAAR5HIUVJCaDAA-e) for hardcore play, but it's easily the most fun I've had with GW2 in a long time. Exotic Zerker and Diviners puts crit chance abysmally low, so slot in Sigils of Vision and play around Mantra of Pain &gt; weapon swap &gt; Mind Wrack. You have unreal mobility in Mirage Thrust, Blink, and SoI, plus CC, stunbreak, and condi cleanse respectively.
---
To tryhard you can take Mirror Images and Signet of Illusions: with two clones out charge Mantra &gt; p4 &gt; p5 &gt; dodge &gt; s1 ambush (lunge) &gt; swap &gt; signet &gt; buffer shatter &gt; mirror images &gt; gs5 &gt; shatter &gt; gs4...3... etc. etc.
---
This combo gives you two full 3-clone shatters with 12-17 might, 100% crit, plus 50% damage from Mental Anguish trait, 25% from Superiority Complex, and potentially more from Fragility. It also hits up to five targets in a small radius! That said, the warmup required is too long, and the damage output too great for most mobs. And the DPS for bosses is ATROCIOUS. God forbid you take it to WvW...
---
This person knows what's up ;)
---
I relate to this
---
Just to add to this, I recently came back to the game and decided to do some older world bosses. I usually play late into the night (around 3am est) and there was a staggering amount of people doing these events. Pretty good memes in map chat too ~
---
It is. You’re not.
---
Laurels
---
Story stuff every 3 months or so. There's no subscription fee, so I don't have to feel like time not spent playing is wasted time.
---
That... Looks painful...
---
FUCK! I'm from brazil too and i bought the PoF with 33% off on other site 3~ days ago --' F
---
Just attempted to do the PvP win guild mission (win 1 conquest game) with four other guild members. We all represented the guild. We won (it was definitely conquest) but didn't get credit for it nor did we succeed in the guild mission. The only thing we can think of is that a) it's because we weren't registered as a guild team or b) we didn't start from Heart of the Mists. The only other possibility is that it is bugged (which is certainly viable). Any of you guys know anything?

In my opinion, the biggest problem with raids is not that they are difficult; rather, the horrible looking for group system. 
---
I pug all my raids, and my largest issue is actually finding a group. Once you learn mechanics the encounters are extremely simple, the time investment comes from finding groups.
---
I wish that they would implement a LFG that is akin to WoW or FF14. This could even go on a boss per boss queue. That way the encounters shouldn’t take very long, and there is an adequate way to get through them.
---
You could also find groups to just get through the entire wing normally as well.
---
That’s my two cents
---
I love everything about this.
---
Drunk engineers are the best.
---
Most impressive. 🙂
---
 Was excited for what they wanted to do to dagger till I saw the changes welp.
---
They nerfed it because it was hitting through terrain (gates in wvw) and it was kinda too op of a lootstick. New autoattack rework just confirmed its design as a ranged weapon instead of a weird hybrid.
---
I will understand if they make ele greatsword as the next elite spec as it nakes sense yet I'm biased cos I dislike GS so it's like welp lol.
---
It's not a big deal, it's just unnecessary because dagger on ele is nowhere near strong or competitive.
---
Still garbage compared to range, accessibility and ease of use of mag leap right now though.
---
Ah I see, kinda wish the game clarified it a bit more. Thanks.

If you realize you can't kill the druid, and yet stay long enough to get killed by an AI, that's on you. Druid anno 2019 is nothing compared to what it was a couple of years ago. It fell down the ladder in the pvp meta a long time ago, damage output is one of those reasons, along with worse self sustain compared to pre-nerf avatar healing that got replaced by a trait that only affect outgoing healing.
---
The pet nerf isn't random. But it surely is stupid. Druid has little damage potential to begin with. Pet damage is mostly less reliable than player damage, base ranger is already taxed on its own damage for having a pet in the first place, and has already picked one out of three traitlines (druid) that gives it no damage whatsoever other than potentially selfbuffing with might. The pet change is just another nail to the coffin, druid is shoehorned into a pve 10 man content spec, aka raids, and second tier at best in everything else. 
---
They could at least have given the pet a trade off in stats in exchange for healing power and concentration, so it could contribute to the sole role druid has as a healer and buffer. The pet always kinda felt like an afterthought to the entire druid spec, and this only solidifies that. What other class has an elite spec that doesn't involve their base mechanic at all outside one single adept trait? 
---
The fact is, the trade off was already there. Picking a traitline aimed towards healing lessens your own damage potential. Base ranger already does more damage than druid. This change doesn't just lower pet damage, it lowers pet surviveability aswell. They already melt fast enough as is in pvp modes when you don't have the soulbeast merge around to instant revive it.
---
I feel you. I always thought heart quests where uninspired and a massive chore.
---
Aurene Aura that's all that's left.
---
I agree with second phrase, but disagree about Scepter.
---
That's how fashion wars work.
---
Other way around actually, the drunk one is the thief, but easy enough mistake to make XD
---
I hear it so clearly in my mind...
---
with the fire auto piercing now, it will do plenty of aoe damage to make up for it.
---
I started playing the game just to explore the world (and cause my friends bullied me into it). Now I play the game because I really enjoy fractals and open world events, because creating new characters is a lot of fun, because I enjoy the story and want to know what will happen next, and because it's given me consistent goals to work for (trying raids, learning and gearing new classes, crafting a legendary, etc).
---
Also, fashion wars.
---
Or you could just not use them if you dont want to. Dont mess with other people's enjoyment of something
---
I actually think the Core Game was the best part of the whole experience.  So If you absolutely love GW2 go for it.  If you just enjoy it, then it isn't a must to me.
---
Honestly hearts are maybe the worst part of GW2. I started playing the game at beta/launch, but didn't really start playing seriously for years because they initially put me off of the game so much
---
I understand if you were playing druid purely as a dps spec, but no one was doing that. Druid is a healer. Healers shouldn't do damage. Makes sense to me. Is it gonna change anything? No .. people weren't picking druid for dps anyway. It hurts them in pvp and wvw tho where he wasn't really strong either so from that perspective yes it was a nerf. But maybe it will get buffed in the future.
---
you forgot dodging and you can also bring a staff if your group doesn't cap might(empower also heals)
---
enough is debatable and a healer is not required for fractals at all..fb has so much aegis spam anyway your group has to try to get hit by stuff and die(especially paired with a rev with soulcleave)
---
the tomes have a long cooldown but remember in fractals you can precast your entire skillbar and reset on the mistlocks(which are like after every fight anyway)
---
yes, you can take the condition removal mantra for certain instabilities or other situational stuff like wall(remember you have a reflect on your tome as well), stability etc.
---
don't remove the quickness mantra, feel my wrath, and the heal mantra as those are extremely strong..blind mantra is situational at best, mostly useless and you provide protection via virtues already
---
bow heals an absurd amount and rez signet is worth sometimes
---
as for diviner rev yes..you only autoattack and use all the energy for utility(in optimal groups that's 90% soulcleave summit only)
---
if you somehow have energy to spare sword2 is a dps gain but it's really minmaxing and you shouldn't worry
---
NPNG occurs every 20s so you totally can play around it, no reason to camp mallyx
---
kalla is your strongest legend so you should almost never drop it and ventari is kinda wasteful outside of the reflect which a bunch of other classes can provide(so it's more of a last resort)
---
you shouldn't auto in staff, upkeep skills can be canceled so you ensure you have the proper energy for cc..you want to be in staff as little as possible(you usually open with it then swap)
---
I really enjoyed GW2 when I bought HoT (PoF is still meh in my opinion) so I would say yes if the base game already brought you enjoyment!
---
I think it's random which procs at that point but could be wrong
---
Saving the world?
---
I don't use them for open world exploration anymore, but as said it is tempting. Especially newer players that dont know what GW2's maps have to offer may fall victim to this and miss out on all the stuff that the open world has to offer. This also results in less and less player interaction.  
---
And this also doesn't really provide any solution for the problem of HoT masteries beeing made obsolete.  
---
But thank you anyways for the suggestion!
---
Youre honestly right, nothing is really changing though, probably just the T4 meta to like Chrono/Ren instead.
---
Those same bosses that needed druid probably still will, I don't see druid getting pushed out of largos at least until mirage is nerfed or given vuln.
---
Heart quests were revolutionary back when they released GW2. That was one of their selling points. That they weren't like ordinary quests...
---
I mean to get where he did he had to atleast complete part of Path of fire. If you go there it assumes you have killed atleast 2 dragons.
---
&gt; only in three way fights with all three servers having 40-60 players
---
Unfortunately, that's not true.
---
Yeah you are staring at MOP, when the game already sucked :)  They lost 7 million players between Wrath and Cata.
---
I’m with others in saying if it’s a feature that you feel takes away from exploring as an experience then don’t use it. However, your post makes me feel that someone should organize in-game tours of maps, not for map completion’s sake but just as a deep dive into the nooks of each map since the map design in this game is top notch. I’m on like my 8th toon and I swear each time I start one up I find new things on old maps I thought I exhausted (and that’s with a mount!)
---
Just wasn't what I was looking forward to doing, I know a lot of people enjoy them but I didn't really like them all that much.
---
Oh, I see.
---
Well, drunk charr in general are something I enjoy
---
Nah and IM not just talking LFR.  Everything in the game has been dumbed down heavily over the years.  Calssic will be coming soon i believe.  I hope they end up doing Vanilla thru the end of Wrath as they go.
---
They should be
---
But also on the flipside if he wants to still do 100% later now it's an unprecedented amount of work to do even though it only seems like he needs 17% he still needs to do like 50%-75% of the actual work.
---
Assumes. OP might be a fraud pretending to have killed 2 dragons. For all we know, they're still alive. Or OP is taking credit for someone else achievements (which might be even worse)
---
the thing is a large number of the people that want more dungeons want instanced content that resembles the actual dungeons(a focus on avoiding certain attacks by looking at the enemy not with a bright orange circle, different routes you can take, frequent choices between how to approach a pack of mobs that actually had damage etc..)..
---
not the dance-around-aoes-while-mobs-tickle-you-with-conditions from fractals nowadays
---
it's not about depth only, currently fractals are a curated/tailored experience and they simply don't have the same feel as old school dungeons have
---
Honestly to me it's always been the core of the game, other things are nice too. But world completion is what made the game special to me, that combined with the events
---
Mythic + keys were a great addition for 5 man content for sure.  The only thing I dont like about it is the time limit.  I hate the gogogogo in them.  I like hard content but dont want to have to rush either.   The best example of difficulty in 5 mans that I could give is back in vanilla.  UBRS was a 10 man, but could be run by a good 5 man group.  That was perfect imo.
---
I always liked the idea but they could've been executed better.
