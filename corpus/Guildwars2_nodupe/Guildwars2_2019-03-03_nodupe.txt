&gt; I wonder how big the LWS content updates will be. Because if they won't add anything significant then I don't really see a bright future ahead for GW2.
---

---
 + we dont know when season 5 will start. maybe the gap between season 4 and 5 will be bigger
---
+ but we know that they already worked on some episodes of season 5 before the lay offs and the reshuffeling of teams
---
+ that means *if* all focus is now on gw2 again (and that is a big if), we will see that influence maybe later in season 5
---
---
---
Get the 9700k, single core performance is important in gw2.
---
You can, yes, though it will likely take a while, unless you find a benefactor to throw a lot of minis at you.  It will take some time of playing Prophecies just to get to a point where you can travel to Eye of the North and get access to the Hall of Monuments, and then more playing will be needed to earn further Tapestries and to actually perform the deeds/acquire the items needed to gain points.
---
But ten points isn't fifty points.  It's very doable if you're willing to put the time and effort in.  The max fifty points is impossible without all the games.
---
I'm sorry, this is a stupid question, but how do I download the .ini file? When I click the link at the website it opens up a page that looks like it came from a .txt file.
---
Having the item in your inventory isn't necessary.  If you have multiple weapon collections progressed to that point, the Heroic Font will give you a choice of which weapon you want progressed when you interact with it.
---
This one is obviously written for clicks only. Talking (again) about the JPrice gate is a nonsense here. For example. A bad one. mmorpg's linked in another post is better in my opinion.
---
Right click the link and pick "save link as..."
---
\*UPDATE\* - All is well, once I entered Kessex from the northeast as suggested.  TY!
---
That statement was made before they had their big shakeup, shut down their other projects, and brought people working on those other projects back to GW2 development. It doesn't tell us much about the current situation -- their plans may be very different now... or they may not. Who knows? Until they say something new on the subject, we really have no clue...
---
"Righfully fired" two words, all is said
---
And... Oh wait talking about JP again. rps are good at this it seems. -___-"
---
looks like they're just talking about season 4 going straight into season 5.
---
this is old news at this point
---
Honestly, I'd rather they poor that extra dev time into better stories.
---
Less childish, more gritty and dark like gw1 used to be.
---
These BS childish level of shallow stories is NOT what the guild wars franchise was built upon.
---
Don't forget that this interview happened when Anet's unannounced projects were still in the works. Now that those projects are dead, Anet could refocus their efforts on an expansion for GW2.
---
"not any time soon" said at august 2018. 
---
I mean if we keep LS5 in mind (wich is content until august-october 2020 -&gt; 2 years from his statement) "not any time soon" is realistic, even if an expansion comes right after LS5.
---
Given how big the expansion team was I highly doubt they have enough numbers for an expansion team and 3 LS teams now.
---
I can't believe this is true tbh. Like how crazy would you have to be, when you saw your biggest incomes were coming from expansions, that people are getting bored of LWS content updates especially when they're so long to come... to not do a third expansion. Especially when you have so many employees working on unannounced projects. I don't think it's true, this would be a suicidal move. I already found it to be a bad move to release mounts outside of expansions, if they're actually just throwing stuff for free while not doing an expansion to make some cash, then I don't understand anything at their plan. They would be so crazy to think LWS content updates and the gemshop would be enough to sustain 400 employees. This is too insane to be true tbh, I'm gonna go ahead and say this is not true. 
---
This statement seems to be taken out of context. ANET said no third expansion anytime soon. Which is true. We still have S5 ahead.
---
LMAO that asura
---
This is entrapment.
---
None of the Legends that aren't Elite spec legends mesh with each other. This is pretty much why ES legends are mandatory because they the only legends with multiple roles they can fit with. Example,  Glint has Support/Condition/Power/CC/Defense. It matches the role of each stock legend. Other legends have their own roles and switching legends change your role altogether. If I am built for healing I have to run Ventari with Glint otherwise my gear becomes useless since other legends dont fit my role. Same for conditions in Demon, etc etc.
---
Sylvari zones and Orr make me want to commit die.
---
Orr mostly due to the mass amounts of underwater HP‚Äôs and HP‚Äôs who are unintentionally guarded by randomly occurring OP champion events. Sylvari zones because every leaf has clipping apparently and there are lots of little nooks and crannies.
---
My favorite is probably Ascalon
---
If no expansion is coming in the next year then it wil be really bad for the game. There is a chance revenue falls below Aion next quarter, and if all there is no expansion on the horiozon I can see it falling much firther.
---
Log into GW1 and select the character with the GWAMM title
---
It probably won't be for the short term from everyone going to get their new mount. It will also be easier to get into as larger than normal queues are expected for the main maps.
---
I started playing Revenant about a 6 weeks ago and it‚Äôs hands down my favorite class, I feel like you‚Äôre basing the build on like metabattle or SC standards, which isn‚Äôt a bad thing IMO but the game can be played with a mixture of custom stat sets, that‚Äôs what has worked for me. I haven‚Äôt even made the attempt to play renegade, I‚Äôve only played Herald (zerkers+marauders mix) and it‚Äôs extremely effective in WvW, T4s+CMs, raids, open world and pvp. I realize Rev is the end all be all class but it has plenty of customization options depending on your play style. Like, during T4s and raids I tend to switch my stances on the fly to adapt to what‚Äôs happening. 
---
Go to - Assassin/Dwarf
---
Failed a couple pulls in T4s/CMs = Dwarf/Dragon
---
Need a little support = swap one out for Centaur
---
Etc etc 
---
I‚Äôm no expert and I don‚Äôt make an attempt to be NUMBA 1 DPS, I just focus on my mechanics and being useful to the team since I know people can be hesitant about non-meta classes. Wish you the best of luck and remember to have fun with it üòÅ
---
They have or had 3 teams, 1 for each episode. 1+4 for 1st team, 2+5 for 2nd and 3+6 for 3rd.
---
&gt;Any design decision you can explain reasonably should be fine.
---
That's exactly what I was talking about: this is a unicorn.
---
What a shame thiefs actually use medium armor.. ;) 
---
For starters I'd say 9700K, just because it's the newest one ... and since Intel (or at least sellers) doesn't lower the price of old generation CPUs when a new one is out, they're at the same price. So better get 9700K rather than buy a brand new ... old one. Usually the reason to get a CPU from an old generation despite it being priced close to the new one, is if you have to upgrade an existing PC ... but it doesn't apply here, because those 2 have the same socket.
---
It's a bit of a shame Intel removed HT from 9700K, until now the whole point of iX names was that 7=HT. But whatever. You don't need HT for GW2, tbh it would even be the opposite : better keep as much power as possible for the main thread, so not "cut" cores in half. Also for the same price, you get 2 additional actual cores, which should counterweight the lack of HT for most thread-incentive applications.
---
Lastly, despite having 2 additional cores (more cores often come with lower frequency), the 9700K has a better boost frequency than the 8700K, which is also better for GW2.
---
Conclusion : get 9700k.
---
True if those assumptions are good, but in that case, the statement still doesn't tell us anything, since it doesn't say anything we don't already know. And if the studio does decide to shift priorities, those assumptions could end up being off, with season five's number of episodes, amount of content, or timing being different in order to accommodate whatever they decide to do differently. We can assume, but we don't really know...
---
"this person tried to unlock your phone"
---
If they do not work on next expansion, they work on sequel, that makes me pretty happy.
---
Can you post a pic of your chars, especially your Mesmer, cause "sandy" got me really curios tbh! :D Maybe of your Daredevil, also? :) 
---
And thanks for the on point reply - you got a point there that I do get bored mostly when I concentrate on map completion, should try to play it more naturally I guess. 
---
All references I've seen are 3 teams ie. the team that did LS4.4 will be doing LS5.1
---
Fine, you detectived me, yet in stead of me deciding to call it quits 100% I came here for other people's perspectives as, at least with me, that can be a factor. Remember the researchers touching different parts of the elephant and thinking it's a rope/wall/etc.? If me trying not to see GW2 just as a rope, but an actual elephant is obnoxious, then be my guest and just don't answer, you're no customer service, so why bother?
---
They're bringing back devs to the game, so while we may not get one soon, I think we might get one eventually.
---
Yeah should have checked the username first the "cz" at the end is an even heavier indicator, but now I'll leave the German version for tge giggles about the "forest runner" (run forest runner, run!) 
---
best wvw translation:
---
IF U DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS DON'T TOUCH IT!
---
I mean actually works as a life lesson as well.
---
That's because power warrior does significantly less DPS than condi berserker. You take power warrior mostly for the CC, and for encounters with phases too short for berserker to build up its damage.
---
Awww that's really nice she put so much effort into it!
---
In an unrelated note, not bothering to read the title from the thumbnail I thought this was a really thick slab of beef, I was very surprised when it loaded in.
---
Er, no, it's pretty common in some developers. Path of Exile and Warframe explain themselves a lot. StarCraft II back in the day did as well, giving extensive reasons behind every balance patch.
---
You only need to be sincere on why you did something, so that people stop believing you don't care and balance randomly.
---
It's quite F'n simple. Give the players what they want not what you *think* they want.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If GW2 maintained it's PvE content with expansions but actually focused on WvW &amp; PvP listening to players with realistic patches &amp; content then this game would be thriving beyond what we could believe. 
---
But nope they refuse to do whats logical and a good.
---
Expansions are good for a myriad of reasons but the biggest one is publicity. An expansion means reviews in games magazines and blogs and that spreads the word about the game and brings in new players. Living story is great but it simply can't have the impact of an announced expansion.
---
And I think it's becoming a lot more obvious that "putting things into living story that would normally come with expansions" is probably just fluff talk for new mounts. I was desperately hoping for elite specs, as I feel, despite complaints about power-creep, they are a very solid way of keeping player interest and creating new ways for players to enjoy the content that's already there. I think if they planned on keeping the living story teams as the main sources of content delivery, creating things worthy of expansions i.e. Elite Specs, Player Housing, new races, etc... would be far beyond the scope and capability of those teams individually. I guess maybe they were just hoping that the current model would last long enough for them to continue beating away at those other projects veteran players are content just getting a new map and another super-dramatic cliffhanger every 4 months 2 fractals and 1 raid a year and balance changes at about the same pace. I can't imagine how small the team must have been working on the WvW alliance system.
---
Tag Wars is something annoying for a long time. Not only in WvW but also in PvE IMO. I'm sure they don't want to change the whole system to avoid "afk" farmers or some other ways to abuse the system but some changes to WvW and some PvE events should be made.
---
In WvW being close to a dying enemy should be enough "proof" that you aren't afk or anything. So any enemy dying to a teammate (let's say a person in your group) while you are close should give you loot.
---
In PvE they should add a new system where a group of (weak) enemies gets combined into one "loot drop". Damage (tag) one enemy of the group and if you participated enough (done enough damage or supported your group) you get the "loot drop" of the whole enemy group.
---
Pretty stupid if players can't play certain builds because the loot system doesn't support it.
---
This was said before the layoffs when they still have other projects who would be the income bringer. Now this is not the case so i would guess there will be a rethink and we might get a expac faster or at least a smaller one.
---
Sadly not. If you're going for power damage you're pretty much locked into Strength and Discipline, and dropping tactics for more damage means you don't have Empower Allies.
---
Strength-Discipline-Berserker *would* be more damage, but less damage than spellbreaker.
---
I did LWS2 maps, HoT, LWS3, PoF and LWS4 maps before I started core on my current main. In that exact order.
---
I need a follow up comment from you saying "Great, now do core pls" :^)
---
No one deserves it more than Gaile Gray. Many of you might be shocked I say this but there are MANY people who've had interactions with her are celebrating right now.
---
this is amazing
---
It's kinda sad honestly. I stopped into EotM yesterday evening because every other map had huge queues/wait times, and came across what I'd assume are new-to-WvW players. I've only been doing WvW with regularity for a few weeks now but when six of us take out a Zerg of 20+ of them and only lose 1 person...yikes.
---
This interview was in 2018 and about LS5 coming straight after LS4 which would put Expansion 3 somewhere at the mid/end of 2020.
---
So the statement "a third expansion won¬¥t come anytime soon" isn¬¥t a " we don¬¥t do a next expansion" but just a honest  statement that is is VERY FAR away. over 2 years from that statement.
---
This dosn¬¥t mean/never ment that no expansion is in work. Just that it probably is VERY FAR away, and like saied won¬¥t come anytime soon.
---
That meta is done constantly, at all times of day. I‚Äôve done it on a full map, during off hours, in the last week. Have you checked LFG?
---
I forgot to include this link. Lots and lots and lots of detail about how XP is earned.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experience
---
A good tip for leveling up is to look for "yellow" creatures that are slightly above your current level. If a creature's name is yellow, that means it will not automatically agro you, but you can attack it and kill it for XP. You can generally find that sort of creature in groups and the fact that it's a yellow-tag makes it safer because that means the whole group won't agro you all at once unless you mess up and damage them all. So groups of yellow-tag creatures that are slightly above your level will yield a lot of XP without much risk of ending up dead.
---
are they confirmed to be mammals though?
---
Expansions didn't give anet anywhere near the return-on-investment that living story does. It just isn't a good business move for them to do expansion 3. Instead, I expect them to roll out expansion-level content very slowly over time, bundled with LS releases.
---
Another game gonna earn them more money.In fact resurecting Gw1 would give them more money then this.Every1 in Gw2 already have favorite mount,armor,weapon skin etc and dont see reason to spand money on it anymore.
---
Try [this site](https://www.gw2style.com) and search based on race and armor weight.  You can see all sorts of different ideas, and any profession within that armor weight can achieve it.
---
The moment they announced that season 4 will lead into season 5 and that living world updates can do what people usually expect from expansions i knew that they dont want to release an expansion. Since then, not even once did they speak about expansions outside of saying that LW updates can do what expansions do. In theory it would be great news, they have double the time to make a much bigger and more impactfull expansion, but they never said something like this. It was just that LW updates can do everything an expansion can.
---
Even now when they told us they are still working on everything which was planed, they never mentioned expansions. It was future PvP and WvW stuff. Future quality of life and LW, but no future expansion.
---
Until they say something about future expansions, im prepared for no new expansions.
---
&gt; is a reaction to them comprising 90% of the porn about this game
---
Yeah, no, you've looked the wrong way. Surely there is some asura porn arong, but we all know who takes 80+%
---
SAB will be back in April since it's  festival now. You'll surely earn enough bauble bubbles during that to buy the node.
---
me2
---
not sure what condition in glint but eh, it doesn't matter
---
i don't think you realize that revenant has the strongest legends as elite because..this is the case for most classes?
---
is core mesmer good anywhere? no! core necro? not really.. core ranger? nothing!
---
exceptions exist obviously so please don't bring up core guard in pvp or core war in pve..most of the elite specs are simply far stronger than any other traitline
---
this is one of the reasons you can't pick 2 elites at the same time or the powercreep would be much worse
---
if you are built for healing rev you actually wanna run ventari/kalla in like 80% of the cases btw
---
**tl;dr** elite specs strong, not core legends weak
---
Oh boy, that‚Äôs 13 hours. You know roughly when he talks about this during the stream?
---
I never knew I needed this until now. 
---
And tbh I don't really want to be seen playing VR games in public. Furthermore how the hell would that work in overcrowded trains or to not been overrun by cars.
---
Another point why I don't like mobil games is their hunger for battery. They drain it so fast and I don't want to have a powerbank, charger with me all the time. I like small creativity games (stuff like tetris) because you can play it quickly anytime and stop without any problem as well. I tried out that runescape mobile game years ago and it was horrible. That kind of games got better of course, but campared to the complexity a pc game offers, they simple don't get my attention. 
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
Asura babies are challenged to make their own formula
---
I think it would fit an 'executioner' styled spec very good, maybe for the warrior. 
---
From the feeling a greataxe would be slower, than a greatsword, but with more powerfull hits. But since even Reaper with GS feels very slow, I don't think this would be the best way to go. 
---
But tbh, all in all I think other weapons would bring more variety to the game. It's only my opinion ofcourse, but I think a greataxe is too close to the greatsword, to make a big difference. I mean, yes, the skills would be more "axe styled", but in the end, it would be very similar to a greatsword, not? Maybe someone can help to convince me at this point. 
---
Expansions. 
---
Thanks for sharing, but i dont spend money on a game just cuz the game deserve tips for creating a good game. I "invest" money for fun i get in return, im fortunate to say i can throw a dollar for every actual fun hours i felt while playing, then again if the game doesnt have anything worthwhile, i dont just go buy and stack gems.. thats too ridiculous. I'd get myself a proper meal and reward myself irl
---
Expansion.
---
Totally make sense as a guardian or warrior weapon, so naturally it‚Äôd get instituted as the new engineer elite spec XD
---
&gt; None of the Legends that aren't Elite spec legends mesh with each other. This is pretty much why ES legends are mandatory because they the only legends with multiple roles they can fit with.
---
I think we should seperate Rev from other classes, because the Rev has no "past". 
---
All other classes had an evolution in their traits, skills etc. over years and had to be good without an elite spec (because there were no). Elite specs then came on top of this. 
---
But the Revenant were released with an elite spec included. No matter how you get the Rev (Hot, PoF or both) you will always have access to one or both elite specs. Unlike other classes there is no way to have *only* the core classes. 
---
So while all other classes need a decent core build, because of the F2P and heroic edition players, the Rev don't. That's why they can build an elite spec that fits perfectly to one (or more) core legend; or other way round, making each core legend fit an elite spec. There is no need to make good core builds, because you always be able to use an elite spec. 
---
The greatsword is a very "light" feeling weapon in the hands of a warrior. I don't think the axe would have to be.
---
I mean, you have a very fast-hitting multiattack on no.2, mobility skills on 3 &amp; 5, and you literally throw it like a boomerang for your no. 4.
---
My thought was to make it a hybrid condi-power weapon, with a 'weight' feeling somewhere between hammer &amp; GS. Short range movement, lots of bleed application, and a bit of CC. I also thought the melee chain could somewhat mimic 1h axe, with the 1-2-3 pattern, but more area effect - 1 hit in 135deg, 2 hits in 270deg, then a triple hit whirlwind attack to finish the chain. It'd look cool if nothing else.
---
Also, I think it should be added to Rev as a baseline weapon. It's always felt like they should have a 2h melee weapon (i don't really count staff - i mean, it counts, but it just doesn't have the feeling of a dps weapon).
---
Whats the worry?
---
S3 was rocky but s4 had decent story telling. Story wise they got a handle. Health of the game esp for gw2 is about legacy leaving not about expac fa√ßade for money making schemes.
---
I know the game has the talents to milk money the right way and expac is not the right time now. Also their competitors in 2019 are catering for very different playerbase so at least this year they can finalize restructuring and catch up.
---
Yup first gift of explo feeels really good.
---
The wiki does say they're mammals  "In matters of childbirth and early development, little is known outside of the knowledge that asura give birth to live young in the same manner as humans (that is, they are placental mammals)"
---
Should have been a pic of toe beans instead of the claws, lol
---
I think warrior would have to get it - What even is the class for, if they can't use all martial melee weapons - but i'd be worried about it edging out reaper greatsword as a necro weapon, unless it were the focus of the next elite spec, in which case what's reaper even for? lol.  
---
I personally want to see a baseline ele 2h weapon. I don't know if a greataxe would fit that ideal, but hell, mesmers get greatswords, and they made that work.
---
I can't speak for PvP, but in PvE Ventari is pretty good the way it is. 
---
Also there actually is no reason to make the core legends usefull without an elite spec. Because (unlike other classes) you will always have one or both elite specs unlocked, when you have the Rev unlocked. There is no need to make the core Rev decent, because there is no reasen to play core Rev.
---
A 3-5 man team is hardly on the same scale as LW teams or the unannounced projects. It's like comparing a teacup to a boiler. Removing this team and moving them into the others will barely, if at all, improve whatever "the others" would be.
---
Am I missing something here? Won't the spirits *never* get healing in a raid, since you generally will have five (or more) players in your healing AoEs? And if you move the spirits out to heal them, your group won't be getting the effects...
---
Highly depended on the class it was given to, and what other weapons it has access to...
---
for example a mesmer should get it as a melee 2-handed weapon; since Greatsword and Staff are both ranged weapons for them.
---
Warrior on the other hand; they have 2-handed melee power &amp; CC weapons in GS and Hammer; so Greataxe would have to be a melee condi weapon. probably through slower slices and spinning. maybe taking some inspiration from *[Axemaster Hareth](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_Axemaster_Hareth)*.
---
Well this is good to hear because as much as I enjoy the class I was worried the numbers just weren‚Äôt going to be there. 
---
I'm reminded of the old Domination mode in SMITE where you had sand djinn you had to defeat to capture the nodes.
---
"Beware the punching sands!"
---
This helps a lot thanks! I can just transpose these for low brass. 
---
My thoughts.. Is to give Warrior a 'War Monger' elite spec.   
---
Utility Skill: *Conjure or Kit*  
---
Have them conjure up weapons/bundles to use. I've always imagined Greataxe to be the elite skill in this case. 
---
That‚Äôs awesome 
---
NOW GET TO DA COOOOAAAWWWW
---
Yeah ty for saying this. I buy gems cause I have a job and no time. I enjoy the living world stories and unbreakable tools and extra slots. I don't play other video games, so to put some extra $ here means very little to me.
---
I don't give a crap about the games health or paying developers, that's weird to consider before buying virtual garbage
---
wow thank you mate for doing this! looks just like the one one :)
---
Ascalon and Orr are my fav zones by far.
---
&gt; Understandable as a pure player pov, but expansions bring players.
---
Nobody I know has ever heard of GW2 unless I tell them about it myself.
---
I picked up the 9700k last month for my new build. I've had no issues with it and it runs great with GW2 the posts above cover why I choose this one. 
---
A true avid rev fan will talk in numbers. Unless youre complaining about how it looks.
---
Youre not wrong ventari revs are underwhelming but ventari renegade is great
---
Ah yes because all birds of paradise have an actual use for their adornments beyond sexual attraction.
---
Collection unlocked first
---
If they can't dev features for the game, they can't sell xpac since it would only be like 5 episodes of LS at 1 time.  
---
Elite spec are good, but they can't balance with 2, so imagine with 3...  
---
As for potential housing or fishing, is this enough to sell xpac ? don't think so.
---
Since my interests are kind of the opposite of yours (I buy gems with each Living World Episode Release because it is new PvE content, though I have trouble spending it on anything that isn't accessible account-wide )
---
**QoL Improvements:** 
---
- More Guild Slots; I'd buy a bunch more if it meant I could keep in touch with more people. currently I don't have space for a PvE Raid guild
---
- Custom(izable) Home Instance; combine Mistlock Sanctuary + Home Instance, so I can mine my nodes, craft and do my banking/trading in, away from the mapchat spam of the shared instances; and away from having to run around long loading screens Lion's Arch)
---
the ones I think it's too late for now, or at least would be a tough sell for me at this point...
---
- Gear Templates
---
- Build Templates
---
after 6+ years of keeping multiple sets of gear in my inventory to swap around between builds without quick-loading/saving features sucked, memorizing which exact traits each of my class builds needed sucked. So the solution for me was to buy more character slots. I've got one slot for each elite spec right now, and I'll probably continue that for the next set, whenever that comes out. getting for each Legendary Armor is out of reach for me due to the time commitment required to get good at the content that is required for it. Ascended gear for 18 classes was easier; and now I just need to buy the mats required to change stats &amp; buy new runes whenever the meta changes.
---
I purchased both expansions, all of the living world episodes, most of the quality of life upgrades when they were on sale (copper-fed, shared slots, character slots, bank tabs), and any fashion (skins, outfits) that catch my eye. If it helps me enjoy the game I‚Äôm ready to open the wallet for it. I won‚Äôt buy everything of course, and I always ask myself if what I want is worth the cost. However, I‚Äôm grateful for the option. I won‚Äôt pay a subscription, because I don‚Äôt like the implication that if I suddenly decide not to spend more money I‚Äôll be locked out of the content I love.
---
Thief is really too much of a glass cannon and relies on good perks to be continuously effective. For a beginner, I would choise warrior. Good 1v1 damage, can soak up a considerable amount of damage and has low recharge on skills.
---
Ranger isn't bad either, with a shortbow.
---
Dude... there's loads of AI, it's just that it's modular so you see a lot of commonality in the design.
---
Here's a very non-exhaustive list: Animals run at a certain health point, karka function differently depending on your range from them, some ranged mobs dodge away, some dungeon enemies draw you into traps or refuse to move from/past certain points, bosses regularly have entirely unique AIs, pocket raptors have unique swarming AI, wurms and mordrem vines seem to share their AI, the Deepstone fractal spiders have a flag that tells them to move in a uniquely creepy way, a lot of the Forged and Mordrem soldiers have AI changes, raids are full of specialised AI both on bosses and the trash enemies...
---
And there are loads more of these little quirks in enemy behaviour, all depending on probably a set of flags applied to each creature and a set of circumstances like player position and movement, health total, etc.. You'll notice unique AI functioning all over the place if you actively look for it.
---
You seem to not understand what a good company does. Hey, that is okay.
---
Istan requires proper coordination too. You need to efficiently break the bar to activate the Great Hall meta, have enough DPS to finish events quickly, and have duo commanders that are able to time/generate maps with sufficient squad sizes to pull off 7+ GH metas per Pala cycle. This can pull your istan gold per hour way up. 
---
This concept applies to SW as well. 
---
An adult adulting right.
---
That seems easy but it's likely difficult to code
---
I do raids with a power banner warrior, and my DPS went up significantly when I started paying attention to stowing my autoattack axe... hit, stow, hit again with 'triple-chop.' I'm still trying to get it up a little more, but that definitely did a lot.
---
If that was the case NCsoft wouldn't have pointed the eye of sauron at Anet. 
---
Buff bitch war in dungeons/ old fractals was illogically fun for me.  Drop banners, hundred blades,  auto attack
---
Yeah, I was figuring the LFG would be a bit of a mess. It usually is.
---
I'll shop around for a raiding guild. I'm so used to playing with my small group of friends that dipping my toes in the water elsewhere is difficult. But I can do it.
---
Thanks again for the advice man.
---
So were the sequels.
---
To counter, I've met plenty of people who play the game or who know of it. It's gonna depends heavily on the crowd you're with, like with most things. 
---
Nobody cares. It's not even out yet and you have no idea how it's actually going to play.
---
i don't care it's not out yet. this is how i want the warclaw to play.
---
Absolutely awesome! Congrats!!!
---
Ha!  I imagine you on your mount running in like that would look pretty funny. 
---
It seems like what you really want is "No mount" Or "Aesthetic only mount". Change is good. It will be tweaked as needed likely. I have been playing WvW 6 years now, change is very welcome. Less chance of you ganking me on your thief or Mirage while I am trying to run back to the fight on my zerg built healing guardian is a great plus lol. 
---
They are trying to shake things up a little. Not add a mount that doesn't change anything. 
---
sounds like you didn't read the list.
---
the changes i propose DOES change gameplay (quite substantially, in fact), in ways that i believe are better than the changes introduced as shown in the livestream.
---
the changes i propose to the gate pull by itself is enough to greatly impact small scale havoc and roaming, nevermind the rest.
---
&gt; based of what, exactly? a livestream where the mounted dev purposely went "oh no, you're attacking me!" instead of escaping?
---
Yes, it showed perfectly, that 90% of the mounts health was gone only by the stealth attack.
---
&gt;nowhere have i said that anet "only fix gemshop stuff / they never listen to players".
---
And **I** never said, that **you** said exactly that. Read my comment and don't twist my words. However, you actually said something similar.
---
&gt;the only time they would drop everything to fix is if gems and money becomes involved.
---
This past season was not a good example of the argument. "At the end of the day expansions are basically a large bundled set of Living World Seasons and if what they say is true (that Living World Seasons will feature more expansion-like content)"
---
3 or 4 hours every 4 months isnt really cutting it for me. 
---
Some other pics/gifs of the glitch. Happened with my other weapons as well!

---
Had you started out as norn it might have actually guided you to a lvl 80 area
---
Axe has less healing than mace right?
---
that's fair, but keep in mind that not all changes are equal, and not all changes are good.
---
things like the 10 player stomp and CC immunity are not good changes. it too heavily favor one playstyle over others, and will lead to a decline in player populations that won't be noticed until it's too late.
---
Ok, my own track record below, but I'll cut to the chase, I don't feel like spending money on anything that I don't feel is a fair deal. If I feel something is priced too high, I won't buy it, even if I want it, even if I want to support the game as a whole. I have to feel that the item itself is worth the list price. 
---
I will never buy a loot box, which is why the mount loot boxes offended me, and the "spend three times as much to get any specific one" offended me even more. There are plenty  of lootbox mount skins that I would have bought for 200-600 gems, but not for 1200. The sooner lootboxes are gone from the game, the better. 
---
I also will NEVER buy an Outfit, even if I think it looks cool, because I want to mix and match armor pieces. If there was one structural change they could make that would revolutionize the game, it would be to unify the three armor types so that they could all be mixed and matched, and all Outfits could be broken up into their constituent parts. There are dozens of Outfits that I would have bought over the years if they had been armor sets, doubly so if they had the option of only buying specific pieces of them.
---
So, my track record is this: I preordered the game and all expansions, with the $90 versions of the latter two, I bought that big $40 gem deal they had early on, and then $20 worth here or there over the years. I've bought the Mistlock Sanctuary  pass, the molten pick, the nightmare axe, a few clothing pieces like glasses, horns, antlers, etc., the katana weapon skin, a handful of glider skins, the Manticore Griffon skin, Kyubi Jackal skin, and the Lunatic mount bundle. 
---
Actually I‚Äôm glad to hear this! Just got an ascended axe but have no clue where to get the mace lol... 
---
I have an opinion too. 
---
I think it will change dynamics. It might make zergs keep a couple of players mounted in the back for securing downs. It certainly is not going to cause more of a decline in player population than the past 6 years of virtually no change and poor matchmaking. 
---
WvW is already heavily slanted to one style of play over another and has been a long long time. 
---
WvW has leaked players in large numbers over the years. This is why we had to do server pairings to start with. 
---
The fact here is this is a game going into year 7 of its life cycle, its gonna lose more players than it gains unless they take drastic measures and make drastic mechanics changes. 
---
Ah, in my guild this is know as the "Ice Cream Pose" because one guildie [got her asura stuck like this](https://imgur.com/VlP2Fja) some years ago, and another guildie commented that her character was just very excited about a cone of ice cream. We were killing ourselves laughing. The animation [even stays if you do /sleep](https://imgur.com/H5tTtmk) and if you hop on your mount.

"Trust me guys mobiles have no soul and aren't even fun so they'll die soon!"
---
Basic bitch critique. I bet you haven't legitimately played a mobile game in you life, you can't disregard an entire platform just because you can't comprehend how a phone could run something more complex than Candy Crush.
---
I‚Äôd want it to feel significantly different from a hammer with a great axe skin and quickness. 
---
Just want to clarify, chrono has very few options for healing their teammates - you‚Äôre essentially limited to your wells, which have long cooldowns and low healing power multipliers even if you try to trait for them. The hybrid heal/boon build for fractals is intended for high-end CM+T4 players who can dodge all the attacks and burst down the bosses before they take damage. If you‚Äôre doing casual daily T4s with unorganized comps, you‚Äôll likely find it very hard to sustain your teammates even if you gear a full healer chrono. I just want to point this out so you know what to expect before you try to get all minstrels gear (which is incidentally very expensive, even compared to other ascended gear). Good healing is as much about the class skills and traits as it is about the stat distribution. My suggestion is to stick to the normal diviners/zerks setup for chrono, and perhaps gear up a healer class separately or LFG for one explicitly.
---
That‚Äôs cool. Is it as big as tyria?
---
I suspect there won't be any until post-episode 6, I don't think they want too much time passing in between them, chronologically.
---
With video editing it depends on the program. With Davinci resolve I get better performance out of the extra threads on the 8700k over the extra cores on the 9700k. 
---
This is only relevant if your not OC‚Äôing, which you should if your buying a K model. 
---
I'll start spending again when the game feels healthy and properly cared about, when we see the return of current events/side stories, hear about an expansion in the works, get more faces, hairstyles, emotes.. The more I type, the less I believe that I'll ever have a reason/motivation to spend again. :'D
---
I joined GW2 in 2016 and it just happened to be the year when we got LS3 with its amazing, exciting current events, and a rare addition of new emotes. That period set my expectation bar pretty high. Those expectations never were met again, since 2018 or so I felt more and more disappointed because let's be honest, you could *feel* the game being silently abandoned. I stopped buying gems with cash mid-2018.
---
Because they were using the cash for other 2 projects and their mistake was to take the playerbase for granted: they thought spoon feeding the veterans with story maps and shiny masteries you use once or twice would be enough to keep enough money being pumped into the game without having to worry about bringing new blood.
---
Well that's six with more experience against them.  I mean take a 20 man squad like them, and put them against another 20 man squad as equally inexperienced and put them against each other.
---
Honestly, I find the sudden detail in the mesh and texture, while the rest is kinda low-res, to be far more jarring than her tids.
---
It‚Äôs time for part III
---
So your comparing your numbers to sc benchmarks right?  power warrior doesn't have the sustained golem dps that condi warrior has, but that doesn't matter, power warrior is meta at several bosses for a reason.  Because power warrior has higher burst, which allows it to have more damage at bosses such as keep construct and conjured amalgamate.  Which means that as long as your know how to burst your damage, and when to burst, you will do well enough for most groups.  
---
Core professions should never be better than Elite specs. The whole point of having to earn them is because they drastically change your class and either rework or add on to the existing core class. 
---
Revenent by itself sucks because it never existed in the game before elite specs, so they never had to balance around it not having one equipped. 
---
I don‚Äôt think a great axe would make a good new weapon, BUT it would be fantastic if they introduced a bunch of great axe skins for great sword/hammer.
---
This is hands down, my favorite game screenshot I have ever seen.
---
Bonus clip from that flight: [I'm sure this is how updrafts are supposed to work.](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/389559492)
---
In game development, you rather don't want to render what the player can't see so that you have the performance available for things the player can see. [Here](https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-uses-all-sorts-of-clever-tricks-to-lo-1794385026) is a link to a kotaku article about how Horizon Zero Dawn does this which illustrates what I described.
---
This could or is probably also happening in GW2.
---
But even if they don't do it that way the amount of detail isn't that high either that it would make much of a difference.
---
This is our beloved /u/GaileGray for sure &lt;3
---
So I don't know where you got that directional guide for your character, but all it's making me think of is watching I Am Bread being played by Markiplier.
---
Sorry to be off-topic. I just don't think I can unsee it now.
---
Also, beautiful art!
---
Any class can get a group. Necro has a VERY old stigma against it from the pre hot days that it still hasn't fully shaken.
---
I main guardian and love it. Sick dps and great for wvw support.  I recommend guard to everyone, even tho we only have about 52 hp....
---
Well,I started playing the game since it launched,reached 80,played for 1 2 more months after that,then I realized the game didn't have the end game content I wished for since I was an avid wow player at the time,and I was comparing the games. As time got by,I also had less time to invest into gaming and started playing gw2 again a couple of months ago and I m having a great time, bought myself both xpansions plus the living stories and now and then if I like sth on the store I ll get it. It s the perfect game if you only got a couple of hours/weekend gaming in a week. It s worth the money for me and buying gems now and then it's worth it.
---
What is the directional overlay? 
---
You are right, im from Czech republic.
---
A WoW clone? This has to be bait haha
---
Old news, in 2018 were 2 products in development aside GW2, now they have only GW2 to make money. So a new expansion is a must. The only question is how much time they have until they have to release one. I think in max 6 months they have or players will leave and sales will go down furthermore. Its a race for Anet and GW2, they must earn their money, NC Soft will not spend a dime for Anet anymore.
---
"...and will die anytime soon" what are you even on about pal, do you even log in and see how many people play it daily? Why do you keep coming to this sub then? 
---
To answer OP, I would suggest you try all GW1 expansions if you have them, its a classic game that is really unique that you can put hundred of hours into without getting bored. Also, you can try GW2 for free and see if you like it too, just download and go at it and see for yourself why this game is special in its own way. :)
---
Soon, never, sometime.  
---
Now go trolling somewhere else
---
GW2 isn't a WoW clone beyond both being MMORPGs. The former is substantially more casual a game than the latter -- less gear grind, for starters. The real endgame is about obtaining fancy skins rather than BiS gear.
---
GW1 and GW2 are different however. Some GW1 players did not like GW2, some do -- it's something only you can decide. 
---
Also, please ignore the other comment in the thread about GW2 dying. Due to layoffs and restructuring by Anet very recently, there have been a fair few fearmongerers and disgruntled ex-players with a grudge looking to convince everyone else to panic and wave pitchforks; this is not true as Anet have said they intend to proceed forward with their plans for GW2, and future content is coming out, although the restructuring might cause some delays.
---
well, just my impression. havnt played GW2. 
---
I think it's taco, might be wrong 
---
GW2 doesn't play like GW1. I wouldn't call it a WoW clone, but it is barely relatable to GW1 at all tbh. Just shared setting really.
---
But GW2's core game is free to play now, so you can always try it out for yourself.
---
Let‚Äôs pull Warclaw‚Äôs tail...!?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh7B6FA4OYY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh7B6FA4OYY) couldn't help but think this hahahahaah
---
Thanks, that was a good explanation. There are a lot of things that it's just assumed you know, like that rangers are not welcomed in zergs and tactivators are Not For You so for a new player it just comes across as impenetrably unwelcoming. 
---
The You Should Know This bar for WvW is set quite high, I think. 
---
I'm so glad someone put this site back up. It's my go to site when I need to see characters and inventory overviews. I was lost without it. Thanks so much!
---
You are quite welcome.
---
I wouldn't put too much into this statement. And even if, I think they will know that LWS4 was good but not enough. I think S5 will be another step up. 
---
i've the same problem ...
---
i have a RX580 with i7 3770 3.40ghz and 16gb ram .....in pvp or fractal i stay on 50-60 fps ....with zergh in PVE with +25 players i have 15/20 fps......my old card GTX 750ti i havent any problem :!
---
I think people woiuld just need to report you. You can swear and stuff as there is a filter, but if you are asbusive or threatening you could potentially be reported
---
Nice! Couldn't resist tinkering a bit with the midi to see how it sounds :p https://clyp.it/xg4dg5mo?token=1484e370c749ede8152c3f3ccdcd57b9
---
nothing serious, just slapped some VSTs to it and added the backing "chords" which are probably all wrong
---
Yep, it's GW2 TacO
---
I am trying guardian right now, so far love it! thanks for all advices!
---
People just want more defense buffs to WvW I guess, going to be really fun trying to take anything in the enemy territory vs a server with a good population.
---
Latency in wvw is very strong factor. IF you have over 200 ping. Meleeattack wil almost never hit and slow speed projectiles will just reportas obstructed on moving target.
---
I'm not a musician but it sounds damn impressive
---
I'm a player who only keeps playing because GW2 is free, secondly for the story. Obviously, this also means that I consider most gemstore options as uninteresting and can count the number of gemstore purchases on a hand. There are a handful of nice-to-have items, but again due to my non-MMO-conform playing habit, they would end up collecting virtual dust figuratively.
---
I'd still pay the full price for an x-pack because I like toying around on a bad-player-skill level with new elite specs while strolling through new zones. Gemstore elite specs, I would consider. That is ignoring the possible weirdness (and imbalance?) if they were released one by one, and players with one profession-of-choice had to wait longer if their spec were available as the last.
---
It's like cooking. Some people enjoy experimenting and creating their own dish, trying different things until they make it perfect.
---
Other people copy a recipe off the net. Or cooking shows.
---
Both kinds of people are perfectly valid and having a good time.
---
yeah I wish they would bring it back as we fought for it in LS1 either as fractal or raid
---
someone still remeber the big scarlet fight in LA?
---
Only MMO I've crafted in was FF14 just because the money you make from furniture is so damn good.
---
Your character just got done playing Skyward Sword and is really excited about telling everyone about it.
---
That would be nice. In my opinion the story of GW2 is its weakest point and one of the main reasons I can never really stick to it. I have all the LS and expansions but I've only played LS up until PoF and it was more of a chore than a game.
---
My plan is to aggressively roleplay about the Ascalonians haunting my artisan patisserie until all the hardcode players go to EoTM leaving us free to do as we please. 
---
Why are you constantly going up and down?
---
Thank you SO SO MUCH for this! I was really missing the old website. Having an overview of your inventories and equipment is so useful!
---
This begs the question, who would they be aiming such an expansion at? If they continue with just the glacial-pace LS updates, they'd be looking at a tiny playerbase to sell it to by end of 2020. üò±
---
I feel like I have seen this here before.
---
Your aa consists of 3 attacks: chop, double chop ans triple chop. So 3 attacks with 6 hits in total. You have to stow the third hit (second hit of double chop) so that you can move straight to triple chop.
---
In short hit hit stow hit hit hit
---
Did you manually come up with these or do you have a script for it?
---
For me Ascalon is the most boring place in the whole world. Every map feels the same. Branded and Flame Legion. + The environment: Brown rocks -&gt; purple rocks -&gt;brown rocks ... 
---
Orr is not that annoying since you can unlock all HP playing WvW and there are no Hearts.
---
The point is that you run Accuracy on GS and Right Hand Strength for the Scepter.
---
Cringe 
---
You get any of the collection pieces from Mordremoth's chest. I 'be never gotten any from Noxious Pods.

The topic starts at 7:27:40
---
Don't we already know this?
---
r/missedconnections
---
&gt; - I'm afraid I'll regret having 2 guardians, OR that I'll regret NOT rolling guardian instead of warrior
---
Having 2 of the same class is not unusual for some players as it could allow you to have more "specialized" characters (for example you have 1 guard for PvE and 1 guard for WvW) and helps with inventory management.
---
But if you don't have 1 of each class yet I would personally go for the class you don't already have.
---
&gt;- I enjoy the prospect of healing others with guardian. However, as we all know, it's not really asked anywhere lol.
---
It is very well loved in WvW and is pretty good/decent as a 2nd healer in raids.
---
&gt;- I HATE that warriors have a half condi half power weapon set. Guardians get to build pure power basically and still access all weapons optimally.
---
I mean idk what there  is to say on this one, it just is :p Some weapons work better with power build some more with condi builds and it's kinda the case for a big chunk of classes/weapons.
---
Tbf not all weapons on power guard/DH are optimal, some are close-ish to optimal but have a different burst potential for example. Guard mostly has weapons that do power damage (with the exception of Axe and Torch) and traits/elite spec/utilities can make it go condi, but even for the condi build you end up using a Scepter in your rotation which is a very power weapon because you don't have any other decent condi choice. Warrior, for example, can have some more dedicated condi weapons to pick from.
---
&gt;- But again I do have a guardian already, BUT she's a bank character now since I had been playing Ranger before I left.
---
If it's your only bank character so far then you can totally say that your human guard is now your official bank character (it's always nice to have 1 at least) and that you will now go create the Norn guard that will be your playable/active Guardian.
---
Enlighten me? Because I can turn off name badges in a *party* but in a squad, there is no option for it.
---
I have never had any of this ever happen to me. I'm not saying this can't happen but never on my server.
---
people like you , are one of the main reasons why the anet layoffs happened , you people cover all the ugly facts with a beautiful sweet mask , absolutely delusional , you are submerged in a sea of delusions and you brought down the devs with you aswell , thinking everything is alright.. keep dreaming &amp; masking off the facts so everything appears beautiful for you &amp; people like you.

Greetings!

I initially quit GW2 around the first raid. My girlfriend suddenly sparked some interest into the game and community, so I thought I‚Äôd make a post asking for a bit of help for the both of us. 
---
1) I‚Äôm looking for advice which profession to pick, since my main goals are to play with my gf, pvp and raiding to unlock the legendary armor eventually. 
---
2) Gold tips to support the cost of crafting legendaries. 
---
3) Any new content or changed content that I could explore with my girlfriend. 
---
4) General tips or head‚Äôs up since the first raid. 
---
Thanks in advance. 
---
I used to play support Chrono.  Then they removed lesser signet of inspiration.  The mimic rotation was such incredible cancer that I quit playing altogether.
---
You can get boosters from achievement rewards, they might be for daily rewards as well (if you have full account game), can be got with laurels (login reward), few are as levelup reward. There are like two endgame "gobblers" that you can feed with excess of some items and they can produce them as well.
---
The cash shop is usually a part of Black Lion Chest, you will get keys from completing maps and some certain story steps, or as super rare drop from monsters.
---
Just a graphic bug that gave the Great Hall a techno/celebratory feel lol

ATM gems are a very little bit cheaper than before sales. 
---
Just missing Warclaw for finishing touches :P
---
&gt;  LWS4 maps
---
Not a fan of Thunderhead Peaks?
---
Yeah, but the same is true of supply, which is a fundamental part of the game. Better to explain what things are than give blanket "don't touch anything" statements. 
---
Spam Aegis dodges and blocks. Dont stop auto attacking on Mace. This should be enough for low pressure fights. If you see your teams healthbars drop go in F2 Tome and press 5 and then spam those buttons. Also try to place F3-&gt;4 down when you have a lot of condis on your team. There is no specific rotation for Healers it all depends on the situation 
---
I would advise saving the money for your utilities bill until something you like comes along. The price of gems for cash doesn‚Äôt change.
---
Mate, the game will literally die if they stick to the current release schedule. I don't know about you, but speaking for myself and all of my friends that played the game: two hours of non-repeatable singleplayer content once every four months isn't enough to keep us interested for more than 10 hours a year. Meanwhile, raids, fractals, WvW and PvP (you know, the content that actually retains players) are either rolled out at a snail's pace or practically abandoned. No, the game needs a substantial content injection to revitalize interest, not drip feeding. LS is OK as the glue between expansions, not as the main course.
---
I scrolled past this so many times and never saw that. Then a moment ago, I looked at it and thought it was like... someone grabbing at it from the bottom. Glad I'm not the only one seeing fingers...
---
Map meta events like the maw of torment and serpent's ire are probably your best bet.
---
I would double-check that it isn't unlocked in Hero Panel&gt;Story Journal&gt; LWS4, then contact support to see if they can unlock it for you.  Good luck, I hope this gets fixed for you quickly.
---
I am very sceptical towards mounts in WvW. But i have accepted that they will come on Tuesday regardless how i feel about it and there for i simply have to wait and see what effect it have, what is bad and what is ok and then suggest things to be change. 
---
My only issue so far is that even our WvW mount have more basic hp then i do as a Elementalist. This tells me and should tell A-Net that it is time to give ele a bit more base hp. The rest of my thought i will apply in a few weeks when i know and seen my self what effect the mount will have on WvW. 
---
And with that i want to say give it a chance to play out before you ask for changes. We have not yet seen the effects of it and wont until all the players who are there to get the mount but wont stay for the WvW have left and the WvW players will have a chance to try ot out to see what it can do and what it should not do and then ask for changes.
---
&gt;i just don't see how MMOs (because we are talking about MMOs here), can be compared to PC MMOs.
---
Now that I sit and think about it, I guess you're right. Most mobile MMO attempts are probably doomed simply because they're all just trying to miniturize the standardized list of "MMO features" like 3D graphics, level grind and raids instead of trying to actually make an MMO designed *for* mobile. I guess you could call that having no soul.
---
But you can see the individual parts making progress. A lot of non-MMO mobile games actually take a lot of inspiration from MMO mechanics, so it's a little difficult to say that mobile games can't have cool gameplay when Dragalia Lost lifted so many combat mechanics from FFXIV and then arguably used them better than FFXIV has.
---
I don't think mobile MMOs are a doomed genre, but I think when they finally get good we might have trouble recognizing them as MMOs. Just making an extremely diet version of a PC MMO isn't doing it. I just get a bit testy when I see people dismissing mobile as a platform, even though there's fundamentally nothing stopping anyone from putting a good game on the platform.
---
Probably depends on how good LS5 will be.
---
Why would they want to nix a game that has in total generated over a billion dollars of revenue? Really?
---
There's a misunderstanding. I'm not new in WvW. But my interest for it is small. That's why I don't know some points yet. I just wanted to target a good post in my opinion. Thanks for the ranger explanations anyway. :-)
---
duh duh duuh duuuuuuh
---
... if you have have such excessive amount of money donate to a proper charity or do some good to your locals instead.
---
What the fuck.
---
Have you done personal story yet? It gives tremendous amount of xp and great gear
---
Considering most stands are named after bands or songs, I think something like "Mr. Sandman" would be more appropriate.
---
Necro: *"You walked in range of my stand, MISTAH SANDO-MAN!"*
---
Others: *"Ohhhhhh my gawddddd!"*
---
Fire shield also procs on the pulsing damage aura that raid bosses have. You don't have to get hit by the boss itself exactly to get the burn effect off. Here is a [log](https://dps.report/G3Js-20190303-141044_cairn) of me burning Cairn with just fire auras.
---
I've considered air traitline but in my opinion fire is the stronger choice because it's minor trait Sunspot grants additional fire aura when attuning to fire (~1,100 healing when granting an aura), and for the superior condition cleansing on top of the extended fire auras.

The rotation does not camp water or overload it often, so most of the condition cleansing comes from fire auras and from attuning to water. Here is a [log](https://dps.report/7aqO-20190217-211443_xera) of condition cleansing on Xera. During this fight I overloaded water only once and cast Phoenix 8 times, thats ~80 conditions cleansed at most. However, the total amount of conditions cleansed was 762, which means that majority of the cleanses came from either fire auras or water attunement.
---
I have some example logs [here](https://dps.report/1UoS-20190301-234832_matt) and [here](https://dps.report/xlW9-20181210-221349_sab) of the build in action. The blast finishers aren't entirely reliable but since there are many of the blasts, some will go through and the results can be seen in those logs in terms of fury generation.
---
WTF are you even talking about? They moved away from gw2, left us with very, very little to do, that backfired, and now i'm supposed to throw money at them? FUCK IT, i will gladly buy expansion, some good armor skin (not outfits, don't really like attack of clones), some QoL item, sure, but atm there is nothing, and it doesn't look like there will be.
---
I would love if someone could re-upload the gw2 patch notes searcher as well, Was so useful.
---
No. ArenaNet is family. Not company. Please, do not mislead people... :/ https://images.mmorpg.com/features/13464/images/GW2%20Mar1%203.jpg

Inside the tomb are six treasure chests that contain trade contracts, unidentified gear and rare elonian weapons.

No jumping puzzle or anything like that.
---
&gt;Edge of the Mists is sort of seen as easy mode and 'serious' WvW players don't go there due to the fact that it lacks certain rewards. The map itself is very cool, though. If you're unsure, go there first (but two Warclaw collection parts need you to go to the other maps).
---
&gt; If you want to do WvW dailies to get potions to help boost your rank, EoTM is a quieter place to do it. Some people say it's dead, but it's fine if you just want to run around in a small group to get to grips before you go onto the main maps. I expect it to perk up over the next week or so.
---
Don't use Edge of the Mists if you need skirmish tickets. Skirmish tickets are exclusive to regular WvW maps and you will need 50 to get the mount. It's time gated and new WvW players will take longer than veterans to earn the pips (because veterans have bonus pips from playing previous weeks as well as WvW rank).
---
Honestly, don't use EotM at all. Guild Wars 2 is largely about rewards, and pips are the best rewards from WvW. For as long as EotM doesn't award equal pips to regular WvW, you are foolish to play there.

I usually do. I even had two ways of doing so set up for it. But habitually, I'm a CTRL-A, CTRL-C guy when working on long posts. This time however I had to copy lots of links and couldn't do that. And one thoughtless CTRL-W later, it was all gone, even after I Shift-CTRL-Ted it.
---
I posted last week about trying to enjoy ranger, but despite my best efforts it just feels uninteresting. I've got limited joint mobility in my hands, so I'm trying to find builds that are fairly simple but I'm a terrible altoholic so I'm constantly swapping characters. My plan is to set them all up with simple builds so I can still enjoy them - what are everyone's favourite easy builds?
---
I'm not a raider or PVP/WvW, nothing competitive, I just like exploring and doing the story.

They are a family and in reality their last name is Arenanet.

Blocked in My country because of copyright issues

I am beginning an investigation in this matter.

You have to be kidding here.

You might need a better hobby

I am pretty sure that working in a friendly environment is more productive than being a "slave" for a big company...

I've been playing Guild Wars since 2005, I will still be playing Guild Wars at the end of 2020.
---
The first expansion killed of my guild. We'd basically been running them over and over and wanted new content. We played through the expansion together and then the guild died off. We all came back for a month though for PoF, but it wasn't for us. With no new content coming out that fit us, we migrated to other mmos/games and eventually fell apart.
---
Thank you. I'm going to check it. 
---
So let's compare Amazon to ArenaNet. Who's doing better? 
---
Why?

you are not the one who decides whats content and what not.

Most importantly, the cuteness factor gives the biggest dps gains.

How'd you get that far? You have to press f to start Glenna at Escort?

Thanks

And that living world signet thing.
---
All classes can be built tanky or full damage, it depends on the stats on the gear and the traits, utility skills and weapons you choose to use. The only class in the game that is naturally more tanky than the rest is maybe necromancer, due to it having a separate health bar in its death shroud mechanic that you can use as a survivability tool.
---
Warrior will likely always be almost a must-have in most organized group content due to the banner utility skills that provide unique buffs, but guardians are also just as wanted due to their very high damage, easy to use dragonhunter elite spec. All this is subject to change, both banners and the meta dragonhunter build are getting tweaked in the next balance patch, but it's unlikely too much will change from what we've seen so far.
---
i've mained a guardian for the past 5 years and i think they're fun as heck. they have a lot of build diversity and firebrand is probably my favourite elite specialization out of all the classes
---
Yea, ofc, I wasn't clear at all with cores/HT maybe, HT acts like "fake core count", so having it gives better performance always at same clocks etc.   
---
Tbh, the new gen of Intel is as dissapointing as the lastest... 4 Gens maybe? They need to renew their brands, and stop cutting HT to get "better core perf", is not the right move to do.
---
Nowadays my choice is Ryzen, even if it lacks some performance for its IPC on games, I do more than gaming, and fits better for me.
---
Please read the italicized notes below the table.
---
It really depends on the content you play. My view is through end game PvE where guardian plays as dps and has very fluid and easy gameplay while the warrior has a weird "support" role using their banners which the next balance patch will make it a bit more active and more interesting in my eyes. In pvp right now guardian (firebrand elite spec) is the dominant class on the support role while warrior is one of the not extremely strong classes. in wvw guardian has always been a must due to defensive buff application while warrior has a more kamikaze fast paced gameplay. 
---
You're almost outside of Divinity's Reach
---
from what I've been looking through, firebrand looks cool. but I also have enjoyed most things in games called "Berserker" so I'm torn lol
---
I spend when I have budget for it, and of course expansions.
---
I do not spend when I do not have budget for it.
---
I can spend about 50-100 in games. Since I have a huge steam library  I'll probably never complete, and I keep getting free games, I kind of stopped paying for more of those and spend all of the budget in GW2.
---
You have some weird fixation with Anet and nepotism, don't you
---
The most sure-fire thing that would part me from my money is an expansion, I've gone for the most expensive option both times so far.
---
Account upgrades like extra storage, shared inventory slots and character slots also convince me to buy gems from time to time.
---
Occasionally I'll find a cosmetic I really like, I believe I purchased the red moth wings for microtransaction'd gems and I certainly spent some of my HoT expansion gems on a glider skin that I've used for about 90% of my characters since.
---
Condi-Firebrand with axe/torch scepter/torch. Good damage and usefull quickness support.
---
What does orchestral mean in this context?
---
If you do what OP did and jump on to the top of DR palace it is really easy to get out of bounds. There are so many holes in the floor above that building with all the altars inside.
---
In addition, with the Keep objectives, if they get defended long enough they eventually will "level up" and get access to additional features. One of the things they get once they get to level 3 is a Waypoint.
---
Im not sure if the EotM keeps get them however
---
I seriously don't care, PoF was announced two months before it was released. Stop the panic, all we can do is to trust Mike Z that said that there is " still a lot coming for GW2". I trust him. 
---
Or, you know, it could have no purpose at all other than showing off to the opposite sex.
---
Stuff like deer antlers and peacock feathers exist in real life too
---
[I know that feeling](https://i.imgur.com/ySuXR4I.png)
---
Nice, in the beginning after PoF launched I kinda disliked how the mounts can easily break immersion, but and the end of the day. I also kinda like how you can park your characters outside of LA Aerodrome to get 1 second loadscreen, and find new places to chill when afk. This is kinda nice as well, as you can see DR in all of its glory. 
---
The size is a trick architect use to make things look bigger than they are. Disney is well known for using it in their parks. Most notably on the Disney castle at the center of the park in Orlando. 
---
Still better than Twilight.
---
Actually I think Twilight might have taken this one for once, on 2nd thought.
---
This is cringe.
---
I can understand the frustration with bad support since I used the steam support a lot, even though I don't agree with your reaction I can understand it, thanks for the tool and thanks for being thoughtful enough to give the code out for others to host.
---
Honestly wait for both expansion to be on sale and buy them.
---
Buy hot. I bought pof first and you cant even do raids pof provides because those wings have high li requirements and people dont do many training runs for them.
---
Don't do same mistake as me. 
---
I swear to god
---
Well, I need something fairly workable. I've looked at metabattle but it doesn't give much insight into complexity of builds. I was just hoping to hear what others might recommend/enjoy as a laid-back playstyle. I tried bearbow ranger but it takes so long to kill anything that it's not enjoyable. 
---
You can look a little at my post history to see some of what I tried. My end diagnosis was that my 580 was never using all available PCIe lanes and thus throttling performance. I picked up an rx570 and it‚Äôs worked no problems, I have an RMA available for my 580 and still haven‚Äôt sent it back yet
---
lol k
---
Both of them and especially if you want to do instanced content like raids, fractals, wvw, pvp since they are very depending on meta builds and both expacs do still have valid elite specs. We use both gliding and mounts so that is also a reason. If you want to raid you can only raid in the wings that the expac have. So again both expansions. Both for 50 dollar/euro is not that much either. 
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **9th Cakeday** FlintStriker! ^(hug)
---
Double shortbow Condi Soulbeast is one of the easiest builds.
---
Guardian or rather Firebrand works great in both S-PvP and WvW. I would go for that.
---
by the gods
---
I'd recommend this review of GW2 that explains the innovative design differences compared to traditional MMO:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax-_06Acj8Y
---
The expansion just add more innovation, especially the  mounts.  You can search videos for the expansions on youtube. 
---
Baseless speculation that is unhelpful and does us no good.   
---
Also getting the expac in Sept 2020 seems crazy soon to me, unless they had already been working on it (and we know they haven't).
---
Burn tempest is one of the strongest builds for unorganized group content (open world events, casual fractal runs and even solo play) since it provides a lot of might, has extremely easy rotation and does very high damage.
---
&gt;  I tried bearbow ranger but it takes so long to kill anything that it's not enjoyable.
---
O'rly?! Can't understand. BearBow is the best build I ever heard off /s
---
Thank you too, i'll check everything later
---
The difference is you can't just mount a rabbit and get up and look at it.
---
did someone say mount a rabbit? uwu
---
I wasn't refering to the layloffs. Can't remember what it was but something happened in early December and therefore they delayed it to after the holidays.
---
Looks like a UV checker map lol
---
It keeps getting better and better! :D
---
I care, and WvW players care. Yes it is not out yet but it does not mean we cannot speculate and discuss. 
---
And quite apparently you care enough to call out OP for having "no idea" on the matter. 
---
&gt;I want a melee class, I want decent suitability and decent dps... but what one is more universally enjoyable
---
Guardian.
---
&gt;Naturally warrior is more dps and guardian is more tanky,
---
Other way around, actually. Guardian has low HP and is more reliant on active blocks. In this way, they can bunker better in active game modes like PvP. But in PvE, where passive damage is frequent, Warrior has more base HP and is more tanky.
---
Warrior is used to give passive buffs to allies, like banners. They are also masters of CC (breakbar) damage, which can stun foes and bosses. Warrior can access the elite specializations Berserker, which is a high condi damage spec with lots of CC, as well as Spellbreaker, which focuses on stripping boons from foes.
---
Guardian is more about active buffs, such as setting up blocks. They can also grant allies powerful boons such as Fury, Might, and Quickness. Some builds also heal quite well too. Guadians can elite specialize into Dragonhunter, an extremely strong frontliner with power damage and traps, as well as Firebrand, which is a very support-y .
---
One is more focused on passive gameplay, one is more active.
---
Personally, I recommend Guardian. Not only is it higher damage, but it has more build options for PvE.
---
Two or six?
---
and I am refering to your "next episode inmay... would be annoying".
---
Yeaaah... I've got the same problem with like 20% of all npcs in cutscenes from the base game. Not a single one from the expansions looks like that though. 
---
ANet pls
---
ooooh, nipple clamps
---
Try both and if you're able (got either of 2 expansions) check out revenant for full comparison of all 3 soldiers professions. Try all weapons in different encounters and then make a choice. If game clicks for you already, there's a high chance that despite of your choice you'll have more than one or two characters in future and not necessary of soldier pofession
---
I assume your arc is up to date? Otherwise, probably your only option is to wait until the next arc update and hope it's fixed.
---
There are no dialogue cutscenes in expanions.
---
The dev said on stream they split it (between pve and wvw) and you wouldn't want to speculate and should wait until Tuesday and see. 
---
Inb4 the developers make the tower into a jumping puzzle.

Hm this is way overcomplicated. 
---
If you're on EU, keep an eye out for training pugs. They are many that open up on weekends for W1, W4 and Escort (maybe sloth and CA if you're lucky) that have no requirements to join. Start there. 
---
If you can commit to a schedule, just join the EU/NA training discords. 
---
As for classes, read [this](https://snowcrows.com/). I recommend Thief as a starting class. Very sustainy, easy to play and meta in almost all bosses. Can carry hard with cc in fights like Samarog, condi cleanse in fights like Sloth, and boons in fights like KC. 
---
There are more options, but generally speaking dps classes are easier as their role usually isn't anything too dificult. 
---
So read the linked site, pick your favorite class, read the specific encounter guides build and rotation, spend 10m on golem learning, then join training group/pug. 
---
I tried to do it on a fresh account so that shouldn't be the issue.
---
Didn‚Äôt think you could make things any better than they already were, but here you are proving me wrong for the second time
---
Don't post the key public, anyone can use it to steal the account through support that way.  Remove it as soon as you can.
---
I pray we get episode 6 in March. 
---
No time to invest a few hours? Maybe MMOs are not for you.
---
Well.. one is free to invest time in.. the other one isn't.  
---
But if you have no time to invest, why are you looking into end-content for MMO's?
---
But they have boobs
---
I have been switching back and forth between GW2 and WoW over the past 6 years and while WoW was a personal favorite of mine for a long time, GW2 has come out on top.
---
I personally find that GW2 has more in-depth things to do, apart from leveling and grinding the same raid over and over before the next ones release, then rinse and repeat. GW2s gearing system is built in a way that even when new content (Expansion or living story) launches, your old stuff doesn't immidiately become obsolete, but you can still find new gear and items to work towards.
---
Endgame-content in GW2 is also very vast, as the game has kept the same levelcap of 80 since the release. Beyond that you level with "masteries", which give you small advantages in certain aspects or are even required to progress through the story, but once you hit 80, your journey isn't over.
---
Speaking of story, the way GW2 handles story is also a lot more interesting to me than WoWs ever was. I find myself actually caring about what I do rather than rinse and repeat questing without reading questtexts and so on.
---
I would highly recommend GW2 to anyone to try, especially since it's free - it doesn't have that cumpolsory feeling of WoW where I feel like I need to play to get my moneys worth. I can easily ignore the game for a few months and then pick it back up without being majorly handcapped or losing money.
---
gold traded in is someone else selling gems, at the end money is made.
---
I happily pay for an expansion, which I did and would still be doing, as it is content I will be playing for days.
---
LW is great, it makes me come back every few months, but that is it, it's not a great incentive to actually pay.
---
No expansions basically means less money from me.
---
*Hi human!* It's your **8th Cakeday** jdaar! ^(hug)
---
That cat looks like it's mentally challenged. Probably Bloodlegion.
---
They made base GW2 with less than 200 people iirc.

---
I think Disney uses it at other parks. Orlando's is actually big.
---
Depends on what you want in a MMO. You want gear progression and a smooth power curve? GW2 probably isn't for you as its pretty fast and easy to get endgame gear. Some Ascended and Legendary gear can take some time, but its not enough of an improvement over Exotic to matter 90% of the time. If you don't mind your grind being for aesthetics though, I think GW2 has the second best combat system in a MMO (Black Desert being the best) and a wide variety of repeatable endgame content to grind for currencies and crafting materials for the shiniest new skins.
---
I think there was more pressure on GW2 than 1, what makes you think otherwise?
---
GW2 was too long in its dev cycle, pressured for release towards initial release, GW1 had less of these issues.
---
What actual influence do you think NCsoft had on GW1?
---
MonkaS
---
In addition to EA on yourself, it is on average up on *more than* 4 other teammates. Assuming it only adds 500 DPS per affected teammate (which is probably on the lower end according to your estimate even when considering chronos and druids) and assuming it would apply to exactly 4 teammates (which is lower than the actual average value), this would still be 2k DPS which is around the DPS increase you get from playing power Berserker - not considering the advantages of Powerful Synergy and other perks of core warrior.
---
So yes, this emphasizes the point you made: DPS increase would be very minor (if any). Power Berserker would need to add more than ~3k DPS on top of core warrior to be noticeably better.
---
One *could* argue that EA actually gives much less than 500 DPS per person on average, that Powerful Synergy is 0 DPS and someone could come up with an awesome Power Berserker rotation. I doubt all three even though I'd love to see it happen.
---
GW2, Assassin's Creed style. Kudos to you!

I just want to say I love your work!

Dulfy would get even more visits.

How do you determine what to do for your daily routines? I don't mean what mode do you play the most. I'm asking about daily achievements, farm routes, etc. There are so many things that I want to do for my characters, that I find that I only have time daily routines and nothing else. I'm wanting to know how you prioritize which daily routines are important enough to actually do.
---
yes it has less healing but still more than enough for fractals
---
Scrapper is a very, very good support in WvW.  In large groups, you can do a lot of healing and condition cleanse.  The thing that sets you apart from firebrands is that when you cleanse a condition, you replace it with a certain boon.  It's going to get even better after the balance patch as well.
---
Please make this a series
---
Yes, I just started my second story module now that I hit 20.  The story is actually good.  I chose the "never found her real parents" story and it's entertaining.  Most games have these (IMO) unbearably long cut scenes.  This is the first MMORPG where I'm actually excited to see the story unfold.  Other games I played I just wanted end game raid content.

My second character down the road will be a norn warrior.  They just look amazing to me.  That race really satisfies my class fantasy of the warrior.

Rather have realistic armor than the absurdly dumb female armors we have now but I realize I'm in the minority. Though it seems most video games are like this for obvious reasons. 
---
It's the artwork used and made especially for the cover here, sorry for the lack of detail ^^'
---
People say Dulfy, but tbh there would be a lot more "GW2 guru sites" where they claim they know where certain item drops are or where certain events are and provide evidence or even YouTube videos for them. I think RuneScape was like this in its older days--not sure it had a wiki so a ton of secrets and other hidden/side content was added to YouTube.
---
Cosmetic or convenience items inside cash-shop and ability of exchange earned in-game Gold currency into cash-shop currency and other way around if spending real money isn't a problem for you.
---
Game is set to be cooperative in PvE - by helping others you help yourself; you get your own loot, experience, gathered materials so there's no rat race for stupid onions, copper ore or exp from bandit riding cattle farm.
---
Dynamic events instead of *classic* "kill 10 rats for me and return for reward, kill 20 rats and return for another reward, kill 10 wolves instead of rats and move to different npc".
---
Active combat and environment that works for you - your placement matters and may affect outcome in fight. You can hide behind tree to avoid being hit, you can lure giant shark onto shore and kill it if you forgot to wear/buy/keep your underwater helmet and weapons. And yes, there's underwater combat - not something great but there are skills that were made for fighting below the surface.
---
Great mounts that doesn't just run ahead; raptor that does big leaps and tail-swipes, rabbit that helps you reach high spots or roll down on group of enemies, jackal with nice teleport-jumps and protective barrier upon landing on allies, skimmer for running over water surfaces and healing upon impact, griffon for flying and beetle for races and fastest travel across the maps. New mount build mainly for WvW game mode comes on March 5th.
---
Vast pool of weapon and armor skins and dyes; there are also cash-shop outfits if you like unified look across your characters or less hassle with style.
---
Game is multicharacter (alt) friendly - especially with ascended/legendary weapons and armor
---
Nowhere where you'd need more than 1 or 2 skills/traits that removes/corrupts boons.
---
I use gw2efficiency not that wiki.
---
PvE/PvP/WvW?
---
Figured someone else would give OP that kind of advice, so I went for something people don't always cover :)
---
I think OP can find a static though, assuming everyone is a beginner!
---
But now they have the entire company working on the game, it‚Äôll be better this time!!
---
Daredevil is the least interactive class in the game. The classic raid build requires like 4 buttons and dodge and the rotation is incredibly simple. You also put out near top dps while doing so and have a ton of evasion windows. 
---
If you removed wiki and all the Dulfy-type sites then Anet would be forced to implement actual clues and information in the game and that in my opinion is way more fun than doing achievements with guides every time
---
significantly? 
---
I don't remember specifics, if you do  do tell, but I think even in a rotation purely consisting of autoattacks the stowing is under 2k gain (extreme safe guess), most likely clear under 1k. And any fuck ups with bring you back to +-0 fast. In a actual fight and all skills this has to be under 500.
---
The stow is cream on top of benchmarks not something I would recommend or call significant in a practical scenario for someone who has things going wrong. Stow after everything else is already optimized.

I've played guardian since release-they're amazing. However, it is often stated that Warriors are new player friendly. Both are viable for all content.
---
Does anyone know if any guilds still run Serpent's Ire and if so when it is scheduled? I missed out on getting the recording early. (NA btw)
---
If you have a guild slot open, why not just make a temporary guild with the name you want?
---
For Fractals/Raids: Thief
---
For solo play: Reaper
---
For PvP: Reaper
---
For WvW: Power Hammer Revenant
---
While you are right, I personally find the thief gameplay very, very twitchy.
---
Yeah, if I have the info off the top of my head I will always try to answer or help first.
---
Would you like it to awaken something in you?  
---
Because I know where you can go for that...
---
Well it's a necessary evil since so many Spanish players refuse to default to English (and same for many French and German speaking folks).
---
The following opinions are obviously subjective to my experience, but I do like to think I can keep things fairly objective.
---
About a year ago I casually played through the entire SWTOR story (and dabbled into raiding), their wiki is half empty and finding info on specific things is hellish.
---
I'm currently playing through TESO similarly. In their case you generally find the info you're looking for, but the way their pages are written and organized (especially for quest chains) is really hard to follow. Not confusing, just god damned hard to read with very little/bad formatting, no images to help you pictures things/people places, etc.
---
Then you take a look at GW2's wiki and everything has very concise directions, images on the side of both the map and the place (hell even that interactive map last I checked), an inlore description, its dialogue at the bottom, etc. It's so neat and utterly complete.
---
I personally really took that for granted, and assumed that any major MMO would have the same thing available to them. I was wrong. Whether your experience was more or less okay with one of these wiki, it's delusional to argue that they reach the quality of GW2's.

Positioning is the single most important skill in WvW.
---
  
---
If you work on this single aspect alone you will improve much more than any other way really, the aim is to never die in fights, no matter what it takes.  
---
Because if they won't add anything significant then I don't really see a bright future ahead for GW2.
---
What is your opinion?
---
This is more than fair to have as a viewpoint but its also possible they want to release something bigger than previous x-packs and need more time to work on it. 
---
For instance, what if living world is going to finish off the story of the dragons and we finally got to go back to cantha? Imagine Gw2 trying to tell more stories than just the big bad dragons and having side stories that matter instead of the one narrative we've always had when living world became a thing.
---
I'm definitely interested in contributing to this.
---
Yeeaaahhhh. It's an MMO. It's okay to have interactions with people, even if it's just sharing information that is available elsewhere.
---
Thunder Thunder Thunder Bears hooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
I never really followed on what the big deal was about her, outside of anet not working with the community that much as it could maybe (compared to warframe, path of exile etc.).
---
Also never really used the offical forums since there are pretty much unusable outside of fluff posts.
---
For what does  she getitng the hate?
---
I guess mystic forge? Haven't tried it out yet xD
---
You f@&amp;$ers got me wondering what an Asuran brothel would look like. Is it like what we normally think or is there a ton of big eared girls doing research with a suggestive look on their face?
---
If you think that core story is good (like me) then you will be amazed by every story chapter from HoT onward. They improved them a lot! Just living story 2 is imo worst of all.
---
You did yourself a favor. Trust me. 
---
To me, a consistent length LS season is only valuable if the intent is to preemptively build up excitement for an expansion without actually announcing it. A good example of this is Nintendo Directs, which almost always have exciting news. The most recent announcement of gen 8 exploited this even more so; there were several days teaser videos/images leading up to the 27 of feb, which was also the 23th anniversary of pokemon Red/blue's release. Even before the announcement, the hype was already there. 
---
I doubt people would complain about season 5 being too short if it was half the length of Season 4, especially not if it meant that we'd get a new expansion even sooner. 
---
lol dude calm down. I agree with you. I'm not saying it's a release schedule I like. In fact, I dislike it quite a bit. I'd personally much prefer expansions where a large portion of the game receives updates and polish. I was merely relaying anet's reasons for their choice to abandon the expansion model; I was not trying to argue in favor of it on their behalf.

Wvw
---
1. Ja lohnt es sich da die maximal Stufe immer auf 80 bleiben wird und niemals von den Werten her bessere R√ºstung dazu kommen wird. Das hei√üt du kannst ohne Probleme aufholen.
---
2. Nein, du kannst im Gem Shop nur Kosmetische Sachen kaufen oder kleine Hilfsmittel. Du kannst aber auch Gold gegen die Shop W√§hrung tauschen so kannst du alles durchs spielen erhalten 
---
3. Was PvE angeht findest du immer Spieler, bei den anderen kann ich leider nichts sagen
---
4. Kann ich auch nicht genau beantworten
---
5. Zur Leistung kann ich sagen dass es bei niemanden optimal l√§uft aber bei kleinen Spieleranzahlen wie in Raids oder PvP sollte es gut laufen.
---
Was die Frage angeht ab wann du PvP machen kannst:  
---
Du kannst mit jeder Stufe in PvP einsteigen da du solange du dort bist auf Stufe 80 gesetzt wirst. Im WvW benutzt du deine normale PvE Ausr√ºstung, im normalen PvP hat jeder die gleichen R√ºstungswerte und die Art der Werte die dir deine R√ºstung kannst du in der PvP-Lobby mit einem Klick oben auf das Helm-Symbol √§ndern.
---
Fighting veterans, or doing events with high mob spawns, soloing a champ.
---
All these let you learn more about your class.
---
Zur wichtigsten Frage: pvp braucht kein spezielles Equipment, alle im pvp haben die selbe Auswahl aus Amuletten mit stat-Kombination. Das hei√üt du kannst ab lvl 2 schon im pvp ohne Equipment nachteile spielen 
---
Wanting to fuck talking rats or furry animals is weird. This community sometimes, yikes.
---
Wenn du haupts√§chlich pvp spielen willst musst du weder Leveln noch gear grinden, das ist im pvp normalisiert. Ansonsten kann das Leveln im pve an einem Tag fertig sein, eine Woche wenn du es ganz traditionell mit Karten Erforschung machst. Im pvp kannst du dir aber auch Level up B√ºcher erspielen 
---
Metabattle.com f√ºr Open world builds 
---
Und godsofpvp.net sollte den pvp Kram haben 
---
Hey!
---
Zu Anfang, das Grundspiel ist Free to Play, du hast dann ein paar Einschr√§nkungen und kannst nicht auf die Maps/Content der Erweiterungen zugreifen. Das hei√üt, du kannst das spiel schon mal austesten bevor du es kaufst.
---
Um auf deine Fragen einzugehen:
---
1. Ich w√ºrde sagen ja. Vor allem als Neuling gibt es viel zu entdecken.
---
2. N√∂. Das einzige was du im Gemshop kaufen kannst, sind Skins und kleine Gimmicks. (Es gibt auch ein paar Items die Ingame etwas "erleichtern", auf die man aber auch ohne Gemshop Zugriff hat. Zudem, kannst du Gems mit der Ingame W√§hrung Gold kaufen, also musst du da nichtmal geld reinstecken.
---
3. Raids sind ziemlich aktiv, es sind eigentlich immer Gruppen im LookingForGroup-Tool. Das Problem da, als Anf√§nger findest du wenige Gruppen, da viele Leute Killproofs und sonstiges verlangen. Such dir da am besten eine Gilde/Gruppe f√ºr Anf√§nger-Raids.
---
4. Ich kenne mich mit dem PvP leider nicht wirklich aus. Aber zurzeit gibt es laut Wiki 3 Spielmodi. Punkte einnehmen, Team Death Matches und Festungen erobern.  
---
Es gibt auch Turniere, wo man sich mit Gruppen anmelden kann, aber das ist nicht wirklich ein Modi.
---
5. Es kann bei Raids (kann nicht wirklich was zum PvP sagen) dazu kommen, dass es ruckelt. Du kannst da einfach deine Grafikeinstellungen runterstellen, das sollte helfen. Diese Ruckler kommen aber auch h√§ufig bei Events mit vielen Spielern vor, auf normalen Karten. Wie zum Beispiel ein gro√ües Boss Event.
---
Und zur letzten Frage: F√ºrs PvP brauchst du grunds√§tzlich erstmal kein extra Gear. Du kannst Runen und weiters im PvP direkt einstellen und musst nichts besitzen. (F√ºr die Skills aus den Expansions musst du aber daf√ºr die Expansions besitzen wenn mich nicht alles t√§uscht, also hast du erstmal zugriff auf Grundspiel Skills). Das Gear hat nur im PvE was zu tun (ich glaube auch im WvW). PvP kannst du frisch mit Level 2 spielen, da PvP einen automatisch hochstuft und alles zur Verf√ºgung stellt.  
---
Und f√ºrs PvE w√ºrde ich sagen dauert High Gear mittel-lang w√ºrde ich sagen, es ist auch nicht wirklich schwer dranzukommen. Beim ersten Mal bauen k√∂nnte es etwas dauern, aber alles annehmbare Zeiten.
---
Keep an eye on this [Boss Timer](http://gw2timer.com/?mode=Tile) and show up early as others have said. Join squad in LFG and right-click port to the commander. You should have no trouble getting the meta done.
---
Fighting? More like clicking
---
Khajiit has breasts, yes. Why not Charrrr?
---
I would not enjoy it wihout wiki. A lot of times I just use it as a reference about things i should have known and forgot. 
---
 Wiki sometimes saves a lot of gold and precious effort and lessens grind times.
---
Fills in lore bits i skipped somehow.
---
Sometimes achievments just need more clear explanation. Wiki speaks about possible bugs as well. 
---
I know what you mean... Josh Foreman was the man behind Chalice of Tears wasn't he? I did it once and I was so salty with frustration, I'll never go back, lol! (This is not a knock against Josh. I will definitely miss him.)
---
Those are the players who complain that the game is too difficult..
---
come to say this.... what leveling? :D
---
It's a Choya now.
---
All of my friends are waiting for an expansion to come back, something for the down voters to mull over.
---
Main story, map completion and dynamic events. Then any mob that gets in the way of any of those 3 things. 
---
Wikis are really all over the place. Probably my best experience in that regard was the souls series. I got dark souls 3 on launch and seeing how the community banded together to flesh out information so fast is incredible.
---
Meanwhile you can't figure out what half of traits and skills do in total warhammer 2 on their wiki.
---
Im not saing its to difficult, im just not intrested on focusing on pressing keyboard right. I prefer gameplay like teemo in lol, no skill mechanic, but you have to think when you play.
---
I would say PoF because I feel that mounts made a huge difference in exploring open world. 
---
One of the very first battle royale game-modes in the gaming industry. I was there and it was incredibly fun. Just imagine if they developed this further and implemented it as an actual game-mode (well, they did, but not to such a degree).
---
Anything but risen brutes. I hate it when they stun you, but because of their slow swing timer, they just stay still waiting for you to get up. 
---
Your pathetic healer offers no reflection, puglings. :P
---
Frankly this fractal makes so little sense dialog-wise. It's like Mars Attacks. "We are not your enemy!" babble pre-boss sunspears while effectively trying to kill the whole party. Yep, totally not my enemy, just trying to kill me (except already dead by unblockable can't-do-anything-you-have-to-die Amala, disgusting ) :P
---
Hm... "Moas break-dancing like on fire"?
---
1. Ja
---
2. Nein, der Shop ist nur kosmetisch + QoL.
---
3. Es sind immer gen√ºgend Spieler da, allerdings w√ºrde ich bei Raids gerade bei Anf√§ngern vom LFG abraten, da ist die Erwartung i.d.R., dass du weist was du tust. 
---
4. Im [sPvP](https://wiki-de.guildwars2.com/wiki/Strukturiertes_PvP) (engl. Structured PvP) gibt es 3 Modi: Bezwingung, Team-Deathmatch und Festung. Die Meisten d√ºrften Bezwingung spielen, Team-Deathmatch weis ich nicht und Festung ist eher unbeliebt.
---
Au√üerdem gibt es noch das [Welt gegen Welt](https://wiki-de.guildwars2.com/wiki/Welt_gegen_Welt) (WvW), in dem gro√üe Gruppen von Spielern gegeneinander antreten. (Das ist auch der einzige Modus, in dem die Serverauswahl abgesehen von der Region (EU/NA) eine Rolle spielt.)
---
5. Allgemein steigt der Anspruch an die Hardware in den Erweiterungsinhalten (u.A. Raids) schon, aber wenn die Offene Welt klappt sollten Raids und sPvP kein Problem sein. Die Einstellungen zu den Charaktermodellen haben meiner Erfahrung nach den gr√∂√üten Einfluss auf die Performance, da kannst du ja mal ein bisschen rumprobieren.
---
6. Exotische Ausr√ºstung (die Zweitbeste) hat man relativ schnell, aufgestiegen dauert da schon l√§nger. Ich hab' damals f√ºr meine erste Aufgestiegene R√ºstung drei Monate gebraucht, aber viele schaffen das auch in ca. einem, kommt halt drauf an wie viel du farmst ;)
---
F√ºr sPvP ist die Ausr√ºstung aber auch (fast) egal, solange du Brust-, Bein-, und Fu√ür√ºstung tr√§gst (egal welche) hast du im sPvP die gleichen Grundwerte wie alle Anderen. (Mehr steht auch im Wiki, das ich oben verlinkt habe.)
---
Zuletzt noch ein paar Tipps: Das Wiki ist eine sehr gute Quelle f√ºr Informationen √ºber das Spiel (das [Englische](https://wiki.guildwars2.com) ist meistens aktueller und ausf√ºhrlicher als das [Deutsche](https://wiki-de.guildwars2.com)). Wenn du im in-game Chat "\wiki *Suchbegriff*" eingibst √∂ffnet sich die entsprechende Wiki-Seite im Standardbroswer.
---
F√ºr aktuelle Builds sind diese Seiten recht n√ºtzlich:

- Allgemein: http://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki
---
- Raids: https://snowcrows.com/
---
&gt; lol dude calm down
---
I am calm and I don't know why you'd think otherwise. 
---
&gt; I was merely relaying anet's reasons for their choice to abandon the expansion model; I was not trying to argue in favor of it on their behalf.
---
Source? I find it interesting that you somehow know their reasons for "abandoning the expansion model" when they haven't even stated that they *are* abandoning it.
---
Waiting for him to jump, fade to black, and then Skyrim intro plays.
---
I like how the asura lost the boobs but kept wearing the fancier outfit anyways.
---
Swimsuits when?
---
When I level a character, I use map completion to do the bulk of my leveling (unless I'm just using tomes for whatever reason). Killing mobs usually isn't that lucrative unless it's progressing a heart, really. IF you have to do that, I would recommend killing yellow-named creatures since they are usually left alive by others and therefore get a huge bonus XP added onto them.
---
I'm actually glad Anet prioritized freedom of exploration over artistic integrity. Clearly 30% of Divinity Reach was not meant to ever be accessible and instead of limiting our movements with tons of invisible walls, they... just opened the door.
---
Granted there are still tons of pointless obstacles and walls all over the place, but it could have been so much worse.

I quite love power SpB myself; between daggers &amp; axes I found melee power damage just _fine_ for that class but then again I was never a big fan of GS as a weapon; and I only use greatsword in WvW now for finishing off downs (100blades locking me in place is *fine* when the corpse can't move :P)
---
2 extra large ones, 4 large ones.
---
&gt; We'll never have 1:1 in any game like this.
---
This is depressing :(
---
It's the same thing with GTA 5. On the same island we have like three different ecosystem and we can go from one extremity to another in five minutes.
---
Characters also mention taking "hours" to drive to certain locations... though in retrospection, hours are sped up compared to real time so I guess "it makes sense", but still.
---
I've always dreamed of a game that truly makes me feel like I embark on a journey or on an actual trip, taking really a long time to reach certain places... Just like it took Frodo a year to reach the Mordor. It's unrealistic, it will never happen like you say, but one can dream.
---
If your friends can only be appeased by an expansion, though, what are they going to do once the shiny new expansion content has been conquered? They'll just quit again and wait for another expansion.
---
The temporary sales boost from releasing an expansion is good, yes, and I'd like the game to have that, but the idea that people can't appreciate slow and steady totally FREE updates just boggles my mind. I *like* having an update to the story and a new zone every few months. An expansion is just four or five zones and story updates dropped all at once... and for what? So you can blow through the content as fast as possible?
---
Literally the only thing that an expansion gives us that regular updates does not is elite specs, and those *are* a big deal... but there's no law that says we can't get those (or other major new features) as part of a regular update, too. And maybe we will.
---
Everyone has their own preferences, and I understand that, I just don't get why so many adults have never learned to appreciate steadiness over instant-then-done gratification.
---
Or we support them by paying for an expansion, not by writting love letters a year later.
---
Was not fun yesterday but managed first try in my pug group luckily. 
---
My screenshot folders would be way less full of dialogues screens.
---
Thanks a lot for giving your opinion! :)
---
Thanks for your opinion! :)
---
I honestly found it fairly tame. We bleed fire reduces damage from the bleeds, torment and burning you otherwise take in the fight, birds need a dodge to disarm but you have the action skill so you're never stuck unable to evade attacks, and last laugh is only murder on the Grenth phase which is probably the easiest phase by itself.
---
Filed under "irritating, but also kinda fun" so far as mixes of fractals and instabilities go.
---
I don't know why they're downvoting you, this is a very reasonable statement.
---
If you don't have an overabundance of free time GW2 might be a better fit for you than WoW.  With WoW there is extra pressure to keep up with level and gear caps, and to feel like you're getting your monthly subscription's worth of play.
---
In GW2 the only pressure besides your own desire to play is social "obligations" to guilds you might join, but that is obviously completely optional.  Twice I've had to take multiple months off from playing due to real-life obligations and was able to come back with out feeling like I was left behind.
---
Thanks for the input! :)
---
Also, AngryJoe made a great review back in the day. And the amount of content and features they added since release is simply overwhelming.
---
Yeah, once I figured out the first two tiers of one crafting discipline, I was set for everything but cooking. Artificer at least had those potions you could work on too. Cooking was fun to figure out though, as one of the last I did.
---
&gt; 
---
Instabilities: We Bleed Fire, Last Laugh &amp; Birds.  
---
I think Twilight Oasis is the most poorly understood Fractal in the entire game only second to Shattered Observatory.   In order to do Twilight Oasis smoothly you really need to have a good understanding of what to dodge, when and why.  You also need to do your best to sync up your dodges to deal with multiple instabilities simultaneously such as a We Bleed Fire Proc from Amala + Birds. 
---
Any class that can bring group-wide stun-breaks, stability, condition-cleanses or rezzing power comes in really handy here.  It's probably the most dangerous Fractal to do without a full set of Fractal Pots or an omni-potion.  It's a huge difference, unfortunately. 
---
/r/guildwarsgonewild
---
Like Mes GS would fit more on ele.
---
Great swords even with their size depending on the make could be quite elegant weapons.
---
Great axes have always been about sheer power and brute force.
---
Yeah I really enjoy Oasis because it's one of those boss fights where you can get into the rhythm of dodging, moving, and attacking You're not just playing dps golem&gt;avoid&gt;golem. That said, birds add an extra dimension of difficulty and annoyance that I find really annoying. If dodging turned them friendly instead of just delaying their return, I'd have much less of an issue.
---
And you should also see this if you wanna something more recent:-)

Not really sure, for my first character I only explored and fought world bosses, and for the rest I did nothing but consume tomes
---
wvw IS a toxic place. Don't try to negate it.  
---
I've blocked over 60 players from my own server because they were non stop flaming each others.   
---
Flaming is the most common speech that happen in team chat. In fact, the scouts are mostly ignored due text burying.   
---
(This while not counting the people that angrily whisper you when you kill them. I remember one desolation player that never ever stopped to whisper flame me for over 3 hours straight)
---
Ah just load up Daggerfall and take a walk. That‚Äôll do ya. 
---
Not that there‚Äôs anything to see.
---
it talks, its of age and it consents. yep. we can fuck it.
---
Mostly carpal tunnel, cause the tomes don't have consume all option. 
---
Trash anet and their shitty mechanics. 
---
It is a great idea, having community events is fantastic and it fits with the #Friendships that Anet does for the month of February.
---
[removed]
---
Pfft, no one goes there anymore. It's all at r/TyriaAfterDark.
---
Going trailblazer armour condi mirage is pretty braindead. That is also a good option if you want to get on people's nerves.
---
I can't decide if you like engineer or not, because you've said a lot of really negative stuff about it here, but you seem to be interested in playing it anyway?
---
I love playing engineer. Holo is absolutely a meta DPS class in PVE, and it does fine in sPVP and as a WvW roamer. Scrapper is a great support in WvW (Firebrand is generally considered better, yes, but that doesn't make Scrapper *bad*). You have multiple builds you can run, with as many or as few kits as you like. You have some cool meme-value setups that you can run just for fun if you get bored. You can run either power or condition DPS and still be very effective. You can run straight support. You can go tanky if you want. Not all of these builds are "meta", but you can still certainly run them in various situations and enjoy yourself.
---
Engineer is absolutely one of the most versatile classes, it's a ton of fun to play, and I really like the aesthetic. Yes, engineer is "good". As for what builds you should go to, that depends entirely on what game mode you're most interested in playing. I personally play sword/pistol (swapping out for sword/shield when more CC is needed) static discharge holo in PVE (I use pretty much the same build for Open World, Fractals, and Raids) as my main. The rotation is simple, the damage is great, and it cleaves groups of trash mobs into ribbons. I've heard other people call it squishy, and I suppose it can be, but I've been playing engi for so long that it just feels normal to me so your mileage may vary.
---
idk....in other games as For Honor, State of Decay2 , i play at Full hd with texture ultra high and i haven't problem of fps...only with gw2 :( 
---
Yes, one of those 3 will have to tank. Both builds work as great healers so they can survive practically anything.
---
There's too many "random pvp / wvw updates" to follow the trend. 
---
Sorry to burst the bubble, but felines don't have engorged breasts like humans do.
---
They'd be flat unless the charr in question was lactating to nurse young. Which may or may not be a bonus for you.
---
Me and some guildies were all shitfaced one night and climbed up there. It was good fun and good bonding.
---
I dont know what you did but those flags surely having a hard time
---
No development for high-end gameplay. Raids are too slow. WvW and PvP development is focussed on low end and baiting in PVE players to patch the issues with the gamemode. Fractals are also focussed on easy faceroll lately. 
---
Hmm, you make a good point.
---
It sounds awesome in theory, but it'd quickly get old when it takes you 2 months just to get from Divinity's Reach to Lion's Arch.
---
haha, is that a hamster or guinea pig?
---
3/4 disconnects per game, every patch coming out with more bugs than the last, ignoring some bugs for almost a year at a time and removal of the battle pass for an obvious cash grab, only solo que ranked, and forced roll que on casuals. 
---
Like I said the game is balanced and still can be fun. But there are ALOT of underlying issues and Titan signing exclusive rights over to a streaming company that isn‚Äôt twitch? Cmon... that‚Äôs a surefire way to kill your competitive viewership. 
---
Smite is a great and balanced casual moba. But the company is holding itself back. 
---
Oh alright. We only looked through the playble classes and since there was a guardian, we thought that might be a tank class but I couldn't see a supporter class. My friend wants to play the guardian actually, is there at least any class that fits well with him?
---
Yep it was really tense today :-D
---
You think too highly of me haha!!! Is it really possible too read attack animations of all enemy types? I mean sure, I pick up on their animations as I fight them, but I can't say I can see a mob from afar and know that it fits a similar pattern to another mob straightaway...
---
GW2 is not even comparable to WoW.  It basically went against everything WoW was at the time of launch.  Now, WoW has actually copied elements from GW2.  As to whether or not you'd enjoy GW2, that really depends on the kind of gameplay you want.  1 and 2 are vastly different games.  I'm glad for that, as they've managed to keep GW1 relevant and enjoyable still.  No harm in trying 2 and seeing how you like it; it's free to play, after all.  
---
Where do they get the funds to make that content? Does it come from words of support?
---
I'm a former WoW hardcore raider who quit at the very end of Mists of Pandaria content and haven't been back and haven't missed it at all. Things I enjoy more about GW2:
---
\-No subscription was a huge one for me. I just couldn't justify forking over a payment every month anymore. Now I have the luxury of using that money in the gemstore when/if I *want* to and can afford to.
---
\-No gear grind! On those very rare occasions when I am tempted to go back to WoW, I remember how long and hard I'll have to work in order to just meet the bare minimum in gear (let alone be raid-ready again, if I choose to do that). If I take a break from GW2, I can come back and still be pretty much geared for anything I want, no matter what I miss.
---
\-Lots of stuff to do in endgame. It's not just raids or nothing.
---
\-Leveling new toons is enjoyable and not grindy. I genuinely like leveling up naturally without using tomes or scrolls or crafting (though I do sometimes). You can still go from 1-80 in a single weekend if you want to, but you don't have to. GW2 is very alt-friendly.
---
\-I don't know if WoW has overhauled the way they handle transmogs since I last played, but ugh it used to be awful compared to how GW2 handles it. I really like dressing up my characters. GW2 characters feel much easier to customize.
---
\-And, on that note... GW2 is WAY prettier. The entire world, the color palettes they use, *everything*. WoW always looks a bare step above Minecraft to me, by comparison.
---
\-The story. WoW does have a pretty good story going overall, but the last real gut-punch I got from it was in WotLK. GW2 punches me in the gut at least every other episode.
---
\-A lot of my friends are too casual to ever play WoW, but they do still log into GW2 occasionally... and GW2 supports that just fine. So, because GW2 is so casual-friendly, I still get to play with my friends even though they aren't as into the game as I am. That's a big plus.
---
There is PLENTY of mesmers doing this for free, just ask in map chat 
---
Well, leveling is nothing more than a long tutorial to get to know the class, experimenting with weapon skills and what specializing to pick and how they work.
---
So personally I enjoy how easy and fast the leveling can be in early maps, 
---
The real test start with HoT if you can solo mobs their you are doing great ^^ 
---
Then define WvWer
---
CS = custom support
---
Typically a SoulsBorne gamer, but my friends had me get this game to play with them. I played WoW in the past but never got into it as there were too many abilities and was super grindy.
---
Anyways, so far I am really enjoying the game, the combat is the most immersive I‚Äôve ever seen an mmo get. I am currently playing warrior, as it wasn‚Äôt a caster and I didn‚Äôt have to worry about buffs and spells as much. I may be overthinking things, but as a dark souls player I like to min-max and make builds, do I need to worry about that in GW2? What stats should I prioritize? Are certain weapon combos better, or am I mostly free to choose the ones I like?
---
Not quite like that! The Discovery interface only highlights items that would work with ones you'v already selected, and it tells you if it would make an iem that you haven't already discovered. A lot of recipes also a straightforward formula, like a pistol requiring a Pistol Frame and Pistol Barrel of the same tier (e.g. Orichalcum and Ancient), and an inscription (e.g. Stat's Orichalchum Imbued Inscription). That's only three items. Sometimes it tells you if there are still other options, like adding Branded Mass to make it a Dragonsblood weapon (though those are recipes you learn). 
---
There would still be the list of recipes you've already discovered, learned through recipes, and unlocked automatically.
---
I played ele and engi at launch and it *did* make me quit the game. I thought the other classes would have too few abilities to keep me engaged but those two just ended up being too many abilities.
---
I came back a month ago, played around with everything, and I've mostly settled on Necro for now. But I'm having a blast this time. Shame I can't get any of my friends to come back and play with me.
---
as someone who left warrior year ago,im just smiling with these changes, 13251515 nerf for war in the row. im smart i picked chrono.
---
My god, that's a great find! I must say that choyas are my favorite addition to come from PoF, they are soo cute and quirky :D 
---
If we're just talking aesthetics, I think the Incinerator has a dramatic draw effect compared to the other two and the flaming-arm thing it does while drawn is very cool. For a thief it would be my top choice, since you'll be able to keep using it even if you decide to switch your elite spec.
---
The Bifrost is a bit more subtle in its effect, the footfalls and aura are more translucent than the other two. If you want to be able to pass the weapon around to your different alts, you'll probably get a lot of use out of it.
---
The Predator has a lot of flame-centric effects similar to Incinerator, if you're thinking of crafting multiple legendaries and you like Deadeye I've always thought Predator and Incinerator make a very nice set together. 
---
If you're thinking more in terms of QoL rather than the look, I think my choice stands with Incinerator. I'm not super informed on the thief meta builds, but I think it's going to be a pretty good constant down the line when more elite specs get added, so you don't feel trapped in a particular one. That said, if there's an elite spec you're really in love with, getting the legendary weapon for it isn't necessarily a bad thing. I did it for Reaper, no regrets. :P
---
I actually wanted to play a character that mainly focuses on healing, but if that's not possible, maybe something that can buff others and myself to a point where it has a real impact on the group. For example a really good atk/ def buff or lowering cooldowns for others (if that's even possible)
---
I'd want to say "I'm in o/" or "Pick me, pick me, pick me!" But first, our different languages could be a problem and then, unfortunately, i'm not at all a musician. 
---
So i'll just wish you good luck. May this project be awesome! Can't wait for the trailer &lt;3
---
I agree that season 5 will take the story in a new direction, but my point is that it isn't clear to me why they'd abandon the LS season-as-prep for the expansion model, especially when they could clearly keep that model and continue on. This strikes me as particularly true in the modern era of television where it is not uncommon for there to be a 'mid season finale' is particularly common and well understood. Aurene's death (or whatever happens next episode) could easily be the mid season finale of season 4, and in a few months the second half of season 4 would start dropping, leading up to the expansion. This preserves the structure of LS season and expansion, while still allowing for a change in story direction.
---
And to be honest, it isn't like we haven't *already* had a midseason change in direction of story, what with the side story of Joko occupying the first presumed half of this season (if, indeed, we're only getting 6). 
---
I mean, if anything, the fact that the story goes out of its way to resolve Joko's storyline, then seemly resolves Aurene's storyline, seems to indicate to me that they're moving toward wrapping the story of this game up, and not leaving any dangling threads for GW3. 
---
ok so in fact a dmg dealer who can block or survive more hits than other classes?
---
Core Guardian is more close to what you might consider a support, sort of? Out of all the heavy armor classes, it has the lowest actual health. It gets its "tankiness" by having a lot of skills it can use to try to heal, buff, and protect allies, along its DPS role. But it's very much a triage kind of role where you need to choose wisely when to use those abilities and you can't expect to carry the party.
---
For a second class, really any two classes who work well together will be fine. Just about all classes are simultaneously support and DPS. The two I would be hesitant to play (if you're set on a "support" feel) are Thief or Necromancer; While Necro has good support builds at expansion endgame, it's a very selfish playstyle during leveling without many buffs to offer; and Thief, while it has some utility with 10-second bursts of stealth, and can stun or daze enemies pretty well, is also pretty short on party support options.
---
If you want to be support/utility during leveling, give Mesmer a try. Although some find it difficult to level. It has a bard/illusionist theme and works with portals, clones, and illusions and is light-armor, medium-health. Mesmer is also technically the community's default "tank"; not for reasons related to traditional tanking, but because its low-dps, high-support role in Raids and decent ability to dodge lends itself nicely to sacrifice DPS gear for tanking gear for the handful of bosses in the game with consistent gear-based aggro mechanics.
---
As for the other classes, Warrior, Revenant, Engineer, Elementalist, and Ranger, they're all fine and have support build options of varying quality at endgame. Any one of those will work fine with Guardian.
---
Here's an obligatory link drop if you want to read up on how the classes play some more:
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:What_Profession_Should_I_Play
---
Wow that's actually amazing for a mmorpg but does a warrior also work as a support? (not that I would consider that)
---
I'm pretty sure I type "/wiki et" more than anything else in this game.
---
nice
---
Why, do they run competing bakeries?
---
GoM just got linked with YB and find themselves in Tier 1 against BG. Once YB drops down to T2, the action should pick up.
---
Oh man, I'm crossing my fingers and taking your post as a good sign. I haven't played since about six months after release and am trying to get my account recovered as we speak. I have the serial code and character name, but I no longer have access to the uni email I made the account on and can't remember any of my old addresses from back then.
---
Nothing will realy change, warrior could be better after the patch and mirage could be replaced by chrono.
---
Not anecdotal, it‚Äôs a common occurrence. No, new one is objectively worse than their previous battle passes. Solo que doesn‚Äôt make it more competitive... in any way. No forced roll que just forces people into rolls they aren‚Äôt comfortable with more often. That‚Äôs not a good thing. 
---
And sure maybe, but not necessarily in the sense of growing the game. 
---
I‚Äôve spent hundreds of dollars supporting that game. I actually know of of the developers in real life, the game is fun and the best value I‚Äôve ever had in a game personally. But hirez just doesn‚Äôt make the best decisions for their game 
---
Yeah i don't understand why he didn't put score:&gt;30 or order:score
---
They don't, the one caveat is that each class has its own starting health, but you can add more onto that with vitality. So say (these numbers are in no way accurate but) 500 extra vitality stat on my necro would get my up to 30,000 because it has a base health of 20k, but would only take a guardian to 20k because it has 11k base health. Again, these numbers aren't accurate at all, its just a way to explain how base health works.
---
&gt;Well, leveling is nothing more than a long tutorial to get to know the class, experimenting with weapon skills and what specializing to pick and how they work.
---
I died my way through HoT with my Ele/Weaver... But I didn't take the time to really learn my skills like I'm doing now... 
---
Good guy Snowskau at the top, but you may want to put order:score or score:&gt;30 at your both link.
---
I really don't know what I was expecting from those
---
Why is anyone bothered about one rune?
---
I wouldnt pay for any of these. But anet gives them to me for free so why should I refuse? If they were smart they would release expansion every 12-18 months. But we already know there werent enough man power to make expansions.
---
A lot of the PVP guides are going to be invalid next week with the coming nerf. Core DPS guard and Dragonhunter are effectively removed from PVP with a 25% crit change drop. Support firebrand will be as good or better than ever though. 
---
in my experience the ESO wiki is incredibly barebones and usually lacks most of the information, just a sentence or 2 seems to suffice for them. In contrast the skyrim wiki is quite detailed and I've never had an issue with it (I just read it for the lore)
---
Boobs are the one thing that separates Khajit from Charr 
---
Man I never thought I'd say this but, the old fractal instabilities were better.
---
Like at least I didn't wanna rip my hair out after playing them.
---
 Hey all
---
Newbie player here, lots of experience in multiplayer games going back 27 years maybe (muds then wow then lotro then back to wow a bit before gw2). Ive been playing for about a week and a half very casually and hit level 32 tonight.
---
A few questions have popped up however and im hoping someone can help me out?
---
1) Game play open world... at the moment if i see an enemy at long range i just pew pew from range, use sic em if its a tough opponent and switch pets just before pet dies. If i have multiple enemies close to me i switch to greatsword and try to keep maul active as long as possible... is there anything fundamental i am missing?
---
2) After finishing my level 30 section of storyline i joined the vigil, where they said i would get missions from centrehouse, but it is just a room with no npcs to converse with, was it just meaningless dialogue?
---
3) Finally, also after finishing my level 30 storyline i got an extra toolbar option, i selected hounds of balthazar--- but these seem to spawn as soon as cooldown runs out? Any idea why?.
---
I know they are all dumb questions, but any help appreciated, thanks.
---
hey there everyone, was curious if people noticed that Superior rune of radiance isn't working? I'm trying to get my tempest geared for Tuesday patch and wanted to run radiance but it seems the duration isn't increasing at all. I know it doesn't show on the tool tip ofc but was wondering if it was bugged or something, thanks
---
Since you felt you want to to throw off numbers and somehow felt liket his would make your statement more true then i have over 15.000 hours only on my main account. I play around 3-8 hours of WvW every day AND i have an account on all EU servers that are not national and several on NA. 
---
Am i better then you now, and are what i said more valid, or?
---
First of all i never said there was no toxic in WvW. I am uncertain how you got that out from what i wrote but this is incorrect read from you.
---
Second of all, if you let someone flame you for 3 hours straight, then i would say you have a problem. If someone flame me for a longer period and i realise that the person have no intentions of listening to what i have to say as well, then i block. I don't let anyone flame me for 3 hours. Wtf man?
---
And third i would say it also depends on server. Some servers have no comunity left and for those servers there will be more toxic involved. But what you described as if WvW was a ever on going toxic place spewing out toxic then sorry that is not true.
---
You can google. I don't need to do your research for you.  You seem to be arguing against yourself here. We agree on everything here yet still you feel the need to argue. That's why I think you aren't calm. Bye.
---
Joined a group that were at boss. Finished it with no issue. Come on guys... I'm awful. Is this really worth a whole thread 
---
So now we will have WvW calvary. Once the enemy has been engaged and downs are being generated they can swerp in and try to get quick rallies for the main zerg.
---
I feel like "players should never need external direction to complete in game task" should be a design mantra. It's more interesting to figure out clues in game than looking up everything because it's obtuse in implementation. 
---
So you don't have a source, that's what I thought.
---
It do have value though. If you have a core account you wont have the restrictions that f2p account have and you also get log in rewards. So it is more worth then a f2p account. 
---
It is great to see they were able to give you the account back thugh, make sure to not delete any of the old characgers because each character have their own birthday so you will get really awsome gifts for them each year.
---
Welcome back and i hope you enjoy HoT :)
---
I have Eagle runes on my weaver and they give me nearly 100% chance to crit with fury. Been told I need to run scholar runes because the eagle runes are bad by comparison, still manage to hang out at the top of the dps charts in WvW sometimes overshadowing everyone else by 100-200k depending on how well placed my meteors are.  
---
I don't miss the extra power, the constant crit damage and 6th slot buff makes up for it,
---
why would dungeons have a different lfg system than everything else?
---
dungeons have a currency to buy gear with
---
Yeah probably, digging the downvoted for giving out a neutral position. 
---
What's the source of these pics again? 
---
&gt;Automatically Dungeon Matchmaking
---
Without trinity there is no need for matchmaking
---
&gt;A reward currency similar to the one in Fractal completion rewards you can use to buy high-end gear (not just skins)
---
You get actual good gear for dungeon tokens. In other games you also dont get raid equip from dungeons
---
&gt;A random Dungeon queue that gives you some extra rewards (Like the Duty Roulette in FFXIV)
---
The extra 5 gold + 250 token is a pretty decent additional reward for 8 random dungeons
---
dungeon finder, fractal finder &amp; raid finder (like wow lfr) system is a must to do for gw2. also dungeon rewards are not worth.
---
experienced gw2 players refuse this requirement (u can see that comments above) but its kinda selfish, coz they they do not care newbie players at all and finder system is always newbie friendly.
---
for example, in wow u do raid lfr and getting in to easy mod raids. but in gw2, u cant get in easy to raids without a guild boost. thats bullsht.
---
and i just say, please stop that elitsm. when you dont need something, it doesnt mean other wont need too. u can still find groups manually. but let others to join content easier.
---
new players, casual players will get in content easier and this will bring you more players at all.
---
just for myself. i never did a raid after 6 months playtime. 1100 hours passed. coz i dont want to be boosted on raids and im a solo player.
---
if there were an lfr system like wow, i could join to raids easy and after that when i got some experience i could go for lfg. is it bad?
---
pls dont tell me to join training guilds, i dont want to be boosted as said. as a solo player i played wow and did every raid &amp; dungeon content. but in gw2, i cant get in raid because of this.
---
Various Forged and Awakened enemies apply boons, so Path of Fire would be a good place to start.  Consider the Maws of Torment or Junundu Rising metas in the Desolation, or various bounty targets scattered through PoF maps.
---
Nope, it reveals that Arena net hasn't been very successful on other projects and pretty much bad management.
---
And now they are taken away some of their freedom because they can't deliver. 
---
I loved final fantasy 14,   Until I got to max level and spent most of my time sitting in queues. Easier just ask friends or guild mates
---
That is not true. Game development simply doesn‚Äôt work that way. 
---
And here I thought it meant Continuum Split. Damn Chronos manipulating time, NERF TIME!
---
That was quite beautiful, thank you.
---
My main dps toon is an engi and it kills it in fractals and most raids. I use the snow crows rifle holo build and it is a ton of fun 
---
Where can I read up on the rework they are planning for this year? 
---
I've read through your entire post here, and carefully considered it before replying, so please don't just dismiss what I have to say out of hand because you don't like to hear it:
---
You really need to be willing to extend the same courtesy to others that you have demanded of them. You came here with a long list of demands (some of which were quite worded quite passive-aggressively), but you're doing *exactly* what you asked others not to do to you -- namely, not really listening to them. At all.
---
I understand that you're looking for answers here, but please understand that when people say they think this game may not really be for you, they're not saying that because they're stupid or because they didn't listen. They are legitimately replying to your concerns, based on the knowledge they have of the game (that you, remember, do not have, because you *asked*). Nobody wants you to just leave because they hate you. They are simply reading what you've written here, considered it in relation to their own game experience, and concluded that maybe GW2 isn't going to be the game to deliver what you seem to want. 
---
I came to the same conclusion, and as I said, I considered this response very carefully before deciding to post it. I have nothing against you, and I would ideally hope that *everyone* would love GW2 for what it is, but I am unable to tell you what I'm doing that makes this game work for me, because your post has already dismissed every single positive that I would share with you. So what else am I supposed to say? Clearly your interests and values -- in a game, anyway -- are different than mine. And that's totally fine.  My way isn't better than your way, your way isn't better than mine -- we're just different, that's all. But it *does* mean that I can't come to any conclusion, personally, except that what works for me clearly isn't going to work for you (as I said, you already dismissed everything helpful that I might say), and so maybe GW2 isn't going to be the game that makes you happy.
---
Just because it isn't the answer you probably wanted to hear doesn't mean that those who have proposed it are being mean or are out to get you. You've just left us with nothing else to say.
---
&gt; pls dont tell me to join training guilds, i dont want to be boosted as said. as a solo player i played wow and did every raid &amp; dungeon content. but in gw2, i cant get in raid because of this.
---
...how is learning your way up from the bottom boosting? Don't you think a LFR system would be far more boosty? One lucky draw and you get 9 experienced raiders with you, you learn nothing beyond being carried. How is that not boosting?
---
Yeah i figured. It wouldnt affect players that prefer manual search in any way yet they refuse it for whatever the fu*k reason. 
---
lfr system is easier than normal content. and you can always complete it with pug, newbie groups. and u just make the first step to raids.
---
thats all and easy. no1 boost you in lfr, because its easy at all. low rewards, easier but first experience.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_Radiance
---
Wiki says that the tool-tips are wrong, but the actual duration should be increasing as it should.
---
yeah thats all i meant. trash rewards but ppl can see some basics. withour worrying to find groups / guilds etc.
---
Ctrl+right click the skill icon. You can turn auto attack on and off for different weapons too :).
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE8PTMSFMUg
---
Good job, that's quite a few of them.  0/10 for no timewarp at end.
---
Just a note to those who don't play chrono, you can still do many of these with other classes such as elementalist or guardian but you need a white mantle portal device, E.G the thauma button room (window of opportunity is much shorter), uncategorised skips etc
---
If you're doing T4s fine, then you can absolutely go dip your feet in raids with a training guild. What's the worst that can happen? You'll die?
---
They can implement easy mode -- but the ship has sailed. If they had implemented it back at launch, yes, maybe. But right now it would be a nightmare to balance all the bosses so that they aren't a faceroll even on a lower difficulty. One common complaint about fractals is that T3 is hell to progress past, because everyone there didn't learn mechanics well enough in T1/2 and now are struggling. Same thing here. A Vale Guardian without punishing greens or Cairn without damaging agony isn't a very hard challenge that can teach anyone anything at all.
---
The day Anet lets me buy more guild slots is the day I go broke. I feel like mine filled up way too soon.
---
And people say raids are difficult. I do a fullrun on monday but get absolutley destroyed in fractals.
---
Yup just worked it out, thanks...god i am clueless! :)
---
the FBI is having a field day
---
Counter-Strike
---
The other comments talked about PvE and pve instanced content, but if you're looking to get into WvW, (mass pvp mode) then you're going to primarily use metabattle.com.
---
Warrior is a great beginner class with excellent solo survivability and good damage. In PvE you'll have 2 meta choices, condi or power. Condi will be through the HoT spec (Berserker) while Power is generally through the PoF spec. (Spellbreaker)
---
Spellbreaker is the organized group meta in WvW and raiding, though Condi warrior is still used in roaming in WvW and in fractals/fun instances.
---
In WvW, as a warrior, you provide damage, crowd control, and boon-strip. 
---
In PvE, as a warrior, you provide banner buffs, moderate cc, and moderate damage. 
---
Your weapons depend on your damage type, gamemode, and build.
---
Note that the banner stuff might change or might not after Tuesday's patch. #balancepatch
---
&gt;edit
---
Ok i see why this game is falling apart, its the delusional community that refuses changes that would safe the game. Too bad. 
---
Always love these temper tantrum edits when things do not go your way
---
Oh for fucks sake join a training discord and learn the fights.  Step out of your comfort zone for once and try something different. People like to teach people how to do raids so there are more players to fill spots. Once you learn the fights join a static group and you‚Äôll clear fairly fast as well.
---
Relying on others to carry you is more of a ‚Äúboost‚Äù imo 
---
Jesus, some of the people in this thread are just assholes. Anyway, thanks again for organizing the even BluJasmine. Hopefully, we will see many future community based events like this. 
---
I let him do that because i was recording all his angry whisper. He was so mad that it was actually amusing.  
---
The issue is that wvw have more toxic conversations than normal ones. I guess that my accounts are all in the worst servers, however i can't even remotely think of wvw as a normal/friendly place at all. 
---
This is why i wanted to correct your statement. If you ever played that many hours, you would have noticed that already.
---
Agreed - confusion is becoming less of a signature condition of the mesmer every patch between f2 nerf round 2 + axe 3.
---
Dungeons are some of the best gold per hour in the game, only being beaten by Flipping, Raidselling, and Fractal 96 farming with T3/T4 fractal titles. There are a couple bugs that hinder your gold per hour too, being DR from going too fast, and certain [Dungeon Recipes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Category:Dungeon_trinkets) not dropping.
---
A "simple" fix to these two bugs could help the dungeon scene grow and more people to find static tour groups. **The key to have the dungeon scene grow without Arenanet needing to help is to stop spreading misinformation about dungeons.**
---
Dungeons aren't very rewarding when you pug them, I get it. I don't think people will try to say they are rewarding. Don't get focused on that, its just like comparing fractal farming with pugs as opposed to statics or other organized groups, but no one does that comparison.
---
its the problem. why should i join a traning discord? isnt it easier to create a finder? join discord, fill form, wait a week if u can find a place, get ready to raid.
---
what about click instantly to "find" button and get you in raid in minutes &amp; seconds? u guys can keep go on with normal &amp; cm raids. finder system wont touch you.
---
why you are acting like this is gonna burn your raiding?
---
its okey, there is a same system on wow. newbies always do lfr,  others if have some experience do heroics &amp; mythic raids.
---
simple as hell man. whats the problem here? asking an lfr system is %100  faultless .
---
it wont hurt you, it wont hurt your raiding, it wont hurt your loots. its just some more work for anet, thats all.
---
Personally, I feel like they marked dungeons as "complete." Due to scaling issues with mobs, rebalancing them to raise difficulty is probably off the table. General drops  from dungeons really aren't that bad. There's already the gold reward from doing 8 random dungeon paths. I do like the idea of a universal currency for dungeons like fractals but I don't see it happening. As far as party issues, I haven't noticed any issues with forming parties. It's true that you never see parties forming in LFG to join. However, any time I've ever added a group, it fills up in a heartbeat. Especially if you mark it with little to no requirements (ie Experienced or Speed Clear vs all welcome). I doubt they'd add a a queue for bonus rewards as they reward players for the content played and not just "to be played."
---
Oh shit, you mean you can still hear us all the way down there?
---
Thanks, i already can tell there is going to have a lot of different music style in it =)
---
People play HoT for the loot and nothing else, the metas have been worked out to a science nowadays so it sure isn't for any kind of challenge, and nothings fun the 100+ time you do it. Anet could release content that is literally walking down a featureless hallway for 5 irl minutes with a chest at the end with a 0.0001% chance of dropping some really shiny infusion and there'll be more players standing in that hallway than in the PoF maps.
---
Kids are kids ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
you don't need x class but you need y support which pretty much every class can provide
---
just because people are lazy and let the condition removal to the druid, the reflects to mesmer and the cc to warrior means nothing..
---
while certain things like boonstrips aren't as easily available to every class they all can chip in some team support to get through in another way
---
Unplayable.
---
While I am all for more dungeon support from the official side, the changes you propose are not necessary and the "problems" you state are just not true.
---
Dungeons are really lucrative if done right!! There are two ways:
---
1. Skip basically everything you can and finish the path as fast as you can (more effective if premade 5man).
---
2. Kill everything on the way. Since dungeons released power creep and rising skill level make dungeons a breeze for meta builds and the mobs give good loot (especially t3/t4 mats are worth a lot).
---
Dungeon LFGs fill reasonably fast (within 5min) for every dungeon except Arah maybe. No need to develop a dev time expensive system that may or may not get used anyway.
---
What is needed is to bugfix existing dungeons. Make condis work on structures like in fractals and make explorable paths for the epic story dungeons they are releasing recently for living world episodes.
---
It's not even out Yet. Play with it for an hour and see. Christ 
---
Still trying to get to the point where I can casually enjoy PVP, but still almost every game [looks like this.](http://puu.sh/CUHDE/1c549b9701.jpg)
---
Is PVP just this inaccessible at this point? I'm not sure I want it to be a focus but it would be kind of fun to dabble in if it weren't always like this.
---
I have set up a PVP build and read a guide, but still we just get demolished, I do no damage, the enemies just explode me, I'm constantly losing 1v2s, 1v3s, etc.
---
10/10
---
u cant complete raid in normal mod with a whole newbie players. so it's why i asking an easier mod.
---
also, i respect to traning guilds and their leaders to try teach. i mean like the people of this reddit thread. u just refuse anything which helps to newbies.
---
its interesting, you are against for an lfr system with no reason. you just keep say "join traning guild" thats all.
---
its not the solution sir. and its not an answer at all. lfr system is helpful and its why i always support the idea of this. thats all \^\^
---
if anet would do this i would be happy. its just a wish.
---
