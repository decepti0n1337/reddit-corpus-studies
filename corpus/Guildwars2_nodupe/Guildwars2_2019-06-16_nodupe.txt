Difference is that the MF removes the need to pay in order to ”gamble” in it. If I want to ”gamble” for mystic clovers I can grind my way to buy the mats that require it. When it comes to BL it’s buy or farm weekly with a *ridiculous* chance of getting any value. If I want to craft Dusk, I can do a collection to earn it. If I want a specific BL exclusive item I need to pay money for it.
---

---
No one here is shitting on RNG, that’s a big part of what MF is. Difference is I don’t have to cough up money in order to use it, which is why it’s an rng mechanic compared to gambling.
---
---
---
Yes, though English is preferred, communication might happen if one part does not speak English but French or German instead.
---
But most of the time, English or grabbing a translator is most common for communicating between different member states in unofficial capacity
---
Axe mirage, by a good margin.
---
It’s not the same. People aren’t killing mobs as a method of farming precursors.
---
Yes it those 20% are the most likely to utilize a language other than their mother tongue to travel, business, or education
---
I've seen these numbers before with 80% average uptime on quickness and alac, 20 average stacks of might, and perma fury.
---
Because they want you to be to able to feel like you can play with friends and so content doesn't feel super obsolete as you progress.
---
Your gear should still be better than it was at level 18 though, so you shouldn't have any major problems dealing with mobs at that level
---
You can't go to school in Germany without also learning English. (That goes for all people who are &lt;54 years old)
---
It wouldn't be as unberable if the animations weren't so absurdly uninspired honestly.
---
Yeah on NA I often have to be speaking both English and Spanish as well as at least trying in Portuguese.
---
Kind of funny to see EU, which is typically thought to be more multicultural, terrified at the prospects of having to use more than just their national language.
---
.. Honey we know the names?
---
And less spiders.
---
This so silly. On NA we pretty much always have to be using both English and Spanish. It’s not hard to use two languages even if you aren’t great in one of them.
---
[removed]
---
Also, we can ride flying things and use gliders _out of our asses_ but yet a rope and a grappling hook to climb is still unheard of.
---
That's actually genuinely interesting; thanks for the info!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I used to speak to a friend (via Steam) from Germany, and I remember him complaining about certain games only having German as the language option (when he would have preferred English due to the usual crappy dubs and voices). Thought it would have changed since then (\~2009) but I guess not.
---
Buy it on the gemstore with money or convert ingame gold
---
Ok. And does the logging in during the release happen yearly or is that only when it was first released?
---
It's not a matter of language, its the server cultures that come with it. Ever since beta, the germans, spanish and french have been separate from the international servers in WvW and they very much have their own identities. These are (partially) centered around them being from the same countries, and so their server identity has a nationalist aspect to it. Many players who have stayed in national servers did so because to them it feels like they are playing for their country. So even though there will be a massive issue with language barriers, there is more to it than just that. This has never existed on NA, so the situations are not comparable.
---
Exactly! I picked leather for my first envoy set because I NEEDED those heels. They're just about the only pair of shoes I use on any medium class now.
---
each new episode is free to unlock account wide from the day it goes live right up until the minute the episode following it goes live.
---
Only within the month the episode was initially released.
---
Gotcha. Thx!
---
Thanks for the math! :) Guess I'll stick to the tools I have, I assume unbound magic is still profitable even if not as much as volatile.
---
Your gear should be in the 20s and try to dodge at the right times. Have you equiped your traits?
---
The hierachy of gears are pink&gt;orange&gt;yellow&gt;green&gt;blue gear of the same levels.
---
Do you have the expacs? Is yes, the elite specs changes the core class drastically, but you won't be able to play then until lv80 and having 250HPs. 
---
Either way, you should try the pvp lobby. Classes play very differently depending on the traits you have equipped. (Eg. Many classes can do support, power or condition depending on the needs, thereby playing very differently)
---
Ok. That makes some sense but i still think it's silly lol
---
And some of my gear was still under level now that i looked. I was not getting any drops or decent rewards, even from the story missions.
---
Get unique hairstyles on each of your characters?

pulling shit out their asses constantly when they're technically a post-apocalypse civilization.
---
I believe gw2 is fine.
---
What the layoffs messaged me is that they want faster releases and better image so they got rid of some outdated rubble that couldnt keep up.
---
Like the top 3 issues in the game are how slow they release and fix stuff.
---
On mmorpg subreddit it is meme how slow gw2 releases stuff and then they just log out after doing new content..
---
They really need to add some longterm goals and harder PvE group content in the game. Like lvl 80 dungeon rework adding bunch of new Dungeons would be cool. Don't even need many people working on that. Raids just aint cutting it mostly due to requiring lot of teamwork and 10 man groups, fractals are also too daily grindy.
---
Its as simple as releasing some stuff that 1-guy can make work like some simple 5-man PvE survival mode that gets progressively harder with already existing PvE mobs instead of always rushing ahead and creating new ones.
---
True, but they also need to demonstrate that they've learned by either actually doing things better or at least making an effort to keep us informed as to what they want for the game's future.  
---
It's fair to give them some time to dust themselves off but it's also fair for people to stay in *"fool me once, shame on you, fool me 687 times, shame on me"* mode as well.  
---
Especially when Anet seem to very much be taking a *"business as usual"* approach to pvp and whatever's left of WvW
---
Nope, **no change needed, except how you approach it.**  If you don't like getting a gift in 5 hours, then break it down in smaller time increments.  If you just do the easy dailies, you minimize your time spent while maximizing your progress toward the gift on a per minute basis.   Once I have 2-3 gifts in the bank, I can relax the routine for a little while.  
---
I have acquired 13 legendary weapons this way, along with 4 trinkets. 
---
**Legendaries should not be easy to acquire**, and if any change is made, ANET should add a PvP element into them.
---
There, there, friend. :( Please don't fret. 
---
We can't all be so lucky.
---
As if language was the main problem with this change..national servers are notorious for prefering the ppt playstyle while most international servers tend to go for fights..
---
Yeah sure, understanding might be a bit problematic at the start but I'd say the majority of people in Europe have atleast some basic understanding of English. The difference in skill level however is gonna be an issue. Linking fighting and ppt servers has already cause issues before and this change won't make this issue any better.

Gift of Prosperity:
---
- 1 Gift of Craftsmanship
---
- 15 Mystic Clover
---
- 1 Gift of Condensed Magic
---
- 1 Gift of Condensed Might
---
Gift of War Prosperity:
---
- 1 Gift of Battle
---
The icons for Gift of Craftsmanship and Gift of Battle are identical, so the recipes look exactly the same when just looking at icons.
---
How you know it will never work? it allrdy works pretty well having a public a 1-2 guilds on the same map.
---
I also play on a german server and dont really understand the hate for french servers.
---
Toughness only matters when you stack in onto already ludicrously overpowered sustain from skill/traits.  
---
On it's own, it maybe grants you another 1-2k of effective hit points and that's about it. And that's assuming you're fighting a power build and not condi where it will do nothing at all.
---
That's cool! Be so awkward if you didn't. I think i just git the generic human line, something about statues.  Also a little disappointed by char eng didnt get to yell "this is bullshit!" Or have any reaction at all to finding out gods are real
---
As a russian player I have to say that I've seen far more french and german speaking people who either didn't know english or didn't want to switch to using it. I would assume it has something to do with the fact that there is no russian version of the game, so those who don't speak english simply don't play GW2.
---
I keep forgetting about externals, but this is going to make me download it right now.
---
Gotcha. Thanks for sharing!
---
You could’ve just watched a video on it first.  I got it first try after rewatching a clip for 5 minutes.
---
I think im on egg #8.  I feel the biggest issue for me is the 3rd now lap around a map, i'm not a huge fan of. Get skyscale, go 4 mins away, repeat 40ish times.
---
You can have slightly easier to get legendary's when I don't have to bust my balls to outfit a class I'll only ever play in WvW with full best in slot ascended gear

Also good to know

And then there are folks who will toss personal insults and kick because you're not doing 90%+ of Snow Crows golem maximums at all times.  Then come here and justify it with stories like this.

Welcome to the greatest bestest gaming community ever.
---
it must've been a matter of time until someone brought it up! 
---
it really does get to you sometimes. i really enjoy the game, probably more than a lot of people. (most if not all in this subreddit probably enjoy the game more than most.)
---
i just wonder what ArenaNet is doing with all this because i know the noise is not lost on them. 
---
with all the complaints of the timegate, they swiftly took an axe to that so we know they have an eagle eye on the voice of their players.
---
there are a lot of areas they could add on, personally i'd just love to see more lore that doesn't feel mandatory. more call-backs to our home cities, mentors, parts of the world non-corrupted, etc. but i also know that there are other developments they're probably working on that take precedence.
---
Anet let all the best parts of their game die on the vine because these people are the ones who spend the most time in game, idling around waiting for the next meta/boss farm to start.
---
There are 3 German servers in T5, who rotate in and out of that tier, as they aren't linked to anyone, as they want to keep the EU to five tiers.
---
While keeping these servers are kept 'alive', they are stuck in those tiers until, one of them gets relinked, while the others to through the same process anyway.
---
So are we seriously keeping five Tiers on the EU side? Alliances can't come sooner enough, even though I don't expect it for a long while yet, while we have this bandaid solution for population.
---
I was able to get a lot of new guys with the 22 dollars for both expansions with 2 level 80 boosts.
---
That's the thing, having him materialise in front of you and talk smack was good for the few episodes we had it, but it's not a gag (nor a personality, for that matter) that has a lot of staying power. You don't want it to end up like Borderlands 2, history's worst videogame, where Handsome Jack just keeps blowing up your phone to deliver Gearbox's trademark side-splitting 'jokes'
---
We shouldn't be mean towards one another when discussing these things.
---
We should be informing people as to why certain things aren't good, and counteract their arguments with proper ones.
---
Being reductive to other people will not get us anywhere.
---
&gt; Arial combat
---
Everything changed when Times New Roman attacked.
---
From the short time I’ve been in GW2 (and even shorter time I’ve been playing WvW) there’s always someone saying something about any given server, “little of it good.” I take it with a grain of salt. Like, for example, Dragonbrand being called “Dragonbags” or Gandara being called “Gankdara.”
---
We had a bit of drama in the discord over it, but I never really see any of that in-game, no. I kind of run at weird times and often only do dailies, though. 
---
The only thing I usually see is someone pulling EWP and calling for help to defend something, or letting team/mapchat know they’re trying to take something.  That seems like pretty standard play to me? I wouldn’t view something like that as “ordering the pugs around.”  If someone’s gonna be rude about that kind of stuff, though, yeah, there’s bound to be some backlash. 
---
I can completely understand and sympathize with a commander wanting people in comms and running a meta class—it’s their tag, their squad, and you should play by their rules. If the tag doesn’t want me, I’d leave and do my best to stay out of their way—trying to impose yourself to that extent just makes things unpleasant for both sides involved. Perhaps I’m the weird one though, for wanting to make the effort to follow the commander’s vision of how to play. 
---
So tl;dr—I don’t really see that, but I might not be the best source for that since I play at strange hours and usually not for very long each day.
---
Now, Kralkatorrik is dead, he did not fear even once and he had foreseen everything before his death. Glints surely lied in some parts. Your theory proved to be true.
---
I really wish this post could be brought to discussion again after those 4 months.
---
I got this and used it, the gold was tempting, but never having to worry about storage is amazing. Inventory full? just open the bank and drop it in. never had anything good drop since though :P
---
Yeah norn could really use some love. They just feel like big humans right now imo.
---
Lmao yes they do.. they also do meta events for chances at infusions.  These all take time and are a game of chance just like black lion keys.  Are you dense lol?
---
I'd say thieves currently are strong options in raids dps-wise, and in different modes in top of that. Plus they got specific roles where most of the people use them (kiting qadim, kiting qadim2). The main problems are either they have to move (dodging as DD) or they need to backstab (DE) which may be problematic in fractal in particular.
---
Also in open world PvE, there are alternatives like 7malice mode where you generates a lot of self boons, plus great traits sustain available (Invigorating Precision). Definitely not as bad as it used to be. This plus one of the best abilities to move in meta maps too (DD)
---
I don't think there is that much classes that can say they are under perma alac and quickness in solo play btw. Like no one, even chrono currently
---
They could do new mounts with unique aspects that compliment current ones. Heck, they could be machines ( like cars, subs, airplanes) or tools instead ( pogo sticks, rockets, grappling hooks, etc).
---
Boy are you late to this circle jerk. Good luck finding someone to hold your hand.
---
The only way to fix that is if they give everyone including non-PoF players, a basic mount. This way, they can just normalize new zones to be mount-friendly even if players don't have PoF.
---
only the training UI, the actual skills do show the change.
---
They quit because he game was boring and garbage. Or they were just a bunch of casuals.
---
It's also probably bots.
---
This video brings up perfectly valid points.
---
The Dislikes to your video are an example of GW2's completely in-denial community, which overwhelmingly shuts down any criticism of the game.
---
I apologize on their behalf.

What really bugs me all Braham had to do was break one old dragon tooth with a fire arrow and all norn rallied behind him to kill Jormag. My Norn at that time had killed 2 dragons, 1 terrorist sylvari, united 3 great orders of Tyria into 1 massive organisation, drove a Charr tank drunk, united Destiny's Edge, slayed Issormir.... But no, that dude cracked a teeth, let's trust him to lead us against a Dragon.

I read this as 4-5k and was like damm dude go outside

The females feel like bug humans. The males feel like huge Dwarves, stumpy legs, bigbheards, good Smiths, beer lovers, oafish attitude.

I'm waiting until I hit lvl 80 on my Thief, my fifth and final character.
---
I went back for the skins and titles and it was a blast
---
Did you enjoy the gameplay? If so then yes it's worth getting back into because the core gameplay is still here and still great. If your actually asking whether or not the game is still alive and well, thus worth playing because the world isn't dead, then also yes because there are still many people playing. 
---
In the end it comes down to if you like the game and feel like giving it another go. As a fellow long time returning player I can say the game is better than ever with even more to do than before once you hit 80.

We are not in the final stages of GW2 , and the living story is not "almost done" . They have announced an entire next season , and there is no reason to think that THAT ONE will be the last either.
---
Exactly what i was looking for, thanks m8 !
---
Any idea on the portal range things ?
---
They have not announced that they are doing that. It's speculation.
---
Synergetics probably made some equations that Statics Asura probably used to engineer the specific structures
---
Not sure where you got the idea that the living world is almost done. Season 5 begins in a few months time.   Yes, I think it's worth getting back into the game. YMMV.
---
For many WvW players this is true, lots of them are basically done with the PvE content but stick around in WvW communities. And they do complain about having to do PvE.
---
&gt;  drove a Charr tank drunk
---
Wait what?  Where and when was this?
---
&gt; having realistic body proportions.
---
I'd be fine with male norn as is, if the biggest body size didn't also make every shoulder piece worn bigger than SMC.
---
If we do go to Cantha and the line isn't changed to that while in the map, I'll forever be disappointed.
---
Honestly the only problem I have with the norn bodies is their stumpy legs, the rest can be overlooked given how their body is mostly covered in armour unless they are NPC.
---
Norn got fucked the hardest from GW1 to GW2 because of this. Becoming the Spirits was like, *the* defining characteristic they had. A major selling point of their race was the ability to transform. Then racial skills were gutted for balance reasons and now Norn are just big humans. There's barely any focus on their legends and none of the major characters ever mention or transform at all. Eir never became the bear when it would have helped her to, you know, not die, and I don't think Braham has ever become to Wolf in 5 years of story.
---
Norn personal story of you select blacked out after a moot as your past mistake during character creation. You don't actually drive it buht rather go around trying to recover it after you lost it after the crazy party night. You listen to people tell you what you did that night, stuff like doing swan dives off the the tank's turret and how you were singing a filthy song that rhymed with "Halrhunting".
---
I'll be fucking livid.
---
Yeah, that is true. Inventory management has been much easier since.
---
 Well, i guess all's well that ends well's
---
Cheers!
---
While its true English is the second most spoken language not everyone speaks it. Hell people in the UK can barely speak it I'm looking at you scousers and Geordies.
---
Ok hold on a second, are you talking about regular levels, or WvW rank levels?
---
&gt;Sounds like a case of being a hypocrite
---
&gt;You know you could do something else besides ping my phone with notifications.
---
&gt;so please leave me alone.
---
&gt; keep going.
---
No its all over panic wheres ma bob/
---
What hurts even more is that the last time I remember Norn being showcased was in the Shooshadoo video...
---
This thread is so funny. Why do you permanently have a stick up your ass? lol
---
It's more like, this language barrier exists for almost 7 years, and ANet makes the gap even larger by giving the game languages support. There'r probably German, French and Spanish players that never had any reason to speak English in GW2. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, absolutely, but now they'll be kinda forced to learn and communicate with English speakers. It may create some negative feelings.
---
&gt;Enjoy your $50 weapon skins and $2000 endless contracts then?
---
Nope, they would be cheaper than that. Something reasonably priced. And more people would buy them.
---
this is beautiful, amazing and appreciated. now i actually want to go back with fresh toons for every race and do the un-highlighted quests to make sure i dont miss a thing.
---
Poe's Law. There are too many stupid people to just assume that someone else is *not* stupid when they say something that is, on its face, clearly stupid.
---
You're using the wrong context of being a hypocrite as a copy &amp; paste retort.
---
That doesn't work.
---
-
---
I did want you to leave me alone, still do.  It's as simple as not responding after I give you 2-word replies, but you keep going anyway. I might as well have fun with it since I'm bored.
---
You could still do something else besides ping me with notifications, but apparently you're obsessed with your emotional response to /r/woosh 
---
Yeah, really, you could leave me alone and be on your way.  I can't possibly see what you have to gain from trying to trash talk someone you don't know over a stupid reason, yet fail remarkably and still keep trying.
---
But sure, keep going.  Why?  Because I'd love for you to make yourself look worse because it's what you deserve at this point.  This is laughable.
---
To be fair day one it was just 500 badges of honor was much easier to get.

Mystic Forge gambling is somewhat gambling, but for most people it's just gambling junk resources that you'd have no better use for, like if a casino just handed you a stack of chips. 
---
Mob killing is not gambling, yes, the result is RNG, but you don't ante anything, you're just playing the game, and some reward will occur, to again use a casino example, it would be like if slot machines did not require you to put any coins in, you could just pull the lever and get what you get.
---
This is perfect. I know I didn't miss a thing, but I did the remaining ones on temp characters that I deleted. Seeing exactly what I expected made me quite happy.
---
Just stop leaning libertarian, it'll make things a lot better for everyone. There's good regulation and bad regulation, fight the bad for being bad, but the good ones benefit everyone.
---
Dunno...doesn't look like enough permafrost dyed armor if you ask me... 7/10
---
They said on steam that they were still checking it for bugs. With it being closely tied to the party system, a bug could break fractals, raids, WvW, and even pvp. So they want to be pretty confident that it's stable before releasing.

ArcDPS is compliant with the requirements that it can only read information gathered directly from the game client. While generally they don't like apps that read memory, they're fine with it as long as it's only to parse combat data. They are not ok with features that include Gear Checking. 
---
Legal does not mean "formally supported". Legal means that you won't be banned for using it. BGDM was banned because the creator continued to distribute gear checking versions to their friends, even after being told to remove that portion. That was illegal.
---
No one has ever been banned for ARC DPS, unless they were being a dick because of it.
---
well, the player base doesn't like to learn and play the game so anet can't make anything that is not completed by AutoAttack, and Anet has no balls to direct their game.
---
the item is called charrcopter. (guild hall HoT item you could pick out of 3 potential items) You can actually do the event that leads up to their invention, by a charr.

No idea on the portal sry I don't really play chrono

It's because toughness is made to counter direct damage and vitality (amongst things like cleanses and resistance) is better for countering conditions.

They even already nerfed alot of the HoT maps
---
is there anyone who can explain this

&gt;\- Kites take orb at the same marker spot

&gt;\- Bring lightning to heart and arrow and spread lava to Qadim (don't start on orb spawn and end at the edge of the second circle)
---
It's only useless because there are so many classes that can absolutely demolish you.
---
If they buffed toughness, it would make the already unkillable classes even more unkillable (unless killed by one of the aforementioned busted builds).
---
English is second language at school in most european countries. Its not the immigrants, its the people themselves. I'm German and on an international server, never went to the national ones. Lots of people on the german servers ive met just arent able to communicate in english. Some are underage, some are 60+. In the end its an international MMO so people should be able to communicate in english. People need to seek out big guilds that are chatty, so you can improve. If you dont try you wont learn.
---
The average pug group after 25 pulls as well

I think you misunderstand Charr. They don't deny the gods are real and powerful beings - they just don't believe they're worthy of worship or even respect, and instead [see them as things to be strived against and fought](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Charr#Religion).
---
Your general point does hold up though - that my Charr main goes along with everything the story puts him through, without protesting, going "screw your magic, screw your gods, I don't trust any of this", without even shooting smart-ass "I told you so's" at people after everything in PoF... yeah. Disappointing.

wing 1-4 lfg in my experience, comm usually dont ask for specific amounts of kp nor they asked for li, just show them whatever amount kp of the wings you have and they'll take you. w5/w6 on the other hand..
---
To me, the emplacement of Dragonfall and the sound of waves in the last cutscene indicate that we're getting underwater-related content right now for season 5. The best we can hope for, if that's the case, is a new underwater traitline for each class (that's much less work than an entire spec), maybe a few abilities or reworked ones, and new maps, with an underwater mount. There's room for a lot of content, but I think they want to keep the charr homelands for the expac
---
Hi. What a great tool! It only shows story on existing characters though. I did all personal story on all races for achievements but ultimately only kept #asuramasterrace.
---
We like to learn and play, just not RE-learn and play when they completely change our rotations time and time again.
---
I'm probably in the minority, but I still wish that Mounts were restricted to PoF and LWS4 areas only. 
---
They really do break a ton of Core and HoT maps, and I was never too upset by the fact we had to run around on foot.
---
well yeah since the other characters were deleted, all their history is deleted too.
---
Truth is that Qadim is nothing more than the Raptor's 『S T A N D O 』.
---
hypocrites. Did I say something untrue lmao, you all  need basic economics classes, I'm arguing with fucking idiots.
---
but the worst attacks against those opponents. they are fast, attack and retreat, some stay on range. this is bad for warrior.
---
People cleared Wing 1 on release without optimal rotations or any rotations for that matter - heck we didn’t have consistent quickness or alacrity uptime, and with how dps checks are completely irrelevant after that wing, I’m fairly confident when I say that arenanet is not forcing you to relearn a rotation for a class.
---
a friend bought the game back in 2012 and wants to give the game a new try, but in order to recover the account he needs both his serial code plus a name of his character. he has the serial code but how is he supposed to remember a character name he made almost 7 years ago? is there a way to recover that name? or recover the account without such an absurd requirement?
---
Are you saying that my english is not the yellow from the egg?
---
I have 9 characters one of each class and I just got a 10th char slot what class should I make it
---
No. When I say endgame, I mean endgame. Open world can be made into an endgame thing. Dungeons, fractals and even acquiring a new elite spec can be endgame. Sure raiding is a part of it but it’s only a small piece of the pie. Anet only focuses on casual side of things. That is what I ment.
---
I wonder every time what people mean by “worth playing“.
---
He silently judges your dps.
---
Use it as a key farm slot?
---
That's a weird way of saying but yeah I guess you could call it selling things without affixing a real price to them. Maybe that price is 5 dollars or it's 60 dollars. I'm not sure why you'd wanna defend this though.

My friend got higher dps in plaguedoctors gear with a botched rotation than 45 other people in a 50 man squad the other day. Trust me 90%+ of players in this game have very little idea of how to actually play their classes at a high level or how to even gear/trait properly
---
It's more like he haven't seen a proper squad with more dmg than auto-attack in Dragonfall...

There has been quite a few returnees lately, so they probably have a large queue to work through.

There have already been cases where non-English speaking commanders have done open tag with their guild on international servers, all you need to essentially do is to ask the commander what “right, left, regroup, (insert any other useful word)” sounds like in the language they speak and then be able to recognise the commands and follow just by the words.
---
There are easy ways to work around language barriers if you can’t speak their languages fluently or at all.
---
As for team and map chat, could keep it simple there too, no need to type up a whole novel for scout reports.

Most people refuse to admit they’re addicts. They’re addicted to small dopamine hits from opening bags of loot. They’re addicted to to getting that bouncy chest. They need those small useless dopamine hits in every step they take, because if they don’t, just like an addict would, they get pissy. It’s not just gaming. People refuse to admit they’re addicted to coffee or sugar. Facebook likes or just having someone to agree with you comment, because that’s validation. People are scared, people are depressed, people are lazy and do no want to work on themselves.
---
On the other hand GW1 servers cost (and used to cost) a dime compared to what GW2 server currently cost so considering both games are massively different I'm not sure it's really fair to compare them in a "Gw1 did that so it should not be an issue for Gw2".

As well as the subreddit previously mentioned by others there is also a looking for guild section on the official forums

&gt;The game is all about community and open world events/bosses

Sooo, circlejerk and 1111ing for rewards? 
---
HoT had "endgame" openworld. It was (somewhat) challenging, it required coordination and investment, it could fail (imagine that. You probably can't, with the new dragonstand). Where did that go? If was nerfed to the ground due to the feeedback from "community" and we haven't have anything like that since.
---
You know, I wish changes that make you play a class in a compleely different way happened more often. Because what you are saying barely ever happens. Even with chrono this isn't a thing anymore.
---
No, they would be in addition, not instead of. I'll rather wait for them to finish alliances before making changes.
---
Yeah, that's what the dots at the end mean ;)
---
Sounds like being an arse, but it's actually a genuine question: isn't Malukah just another medriocre youtube wannabe-celebrity with tits? I've listened to a few of her songs, nice enough, but nowhere near any form that'd be usable on a professional level?
---
They nerfed the minigame where you play fetch with the Skyscale. *Playing fetch* was deemed too challenging.
---
I’m sure someone will correct me if I’m wrong, but I think there was a developer who explained in a tweet that the reason the last season had such a definitive end was because when they were planning it out they didn’t know if it would be last bit of content for gw2 - maybe this was before the cuts were made, so at that point it might not have been clear what teams were going to be cut. But who knows. I’m sure Anet are willing, but NCSoft have a history of shutting down games even if they’re still profitable (because nothing is quite as profitable as their mobile game - and why have some money when you feel entitled to all the money?)
---
Same on Abbadon's Mouth; people will whine and cry about english-speakers and every location call-out is with the german names. It got so bad, i eventually bought 2000 gems just to transfer away from shit like that.
---
What about the wvw only players who are forced to do a whole core tyria map completion for their legendary weapons?
---
how do they even do that much damage? I havnt played wvw in a while and ran in and got instad so many times. I dont know what builds they have to ouput that hard
---
&gt;Lots of people on the german servers ive met just arent able to communicate in english.
---
I've met some who couldn't speak english, but most seem to be just unwilling to speak another language even when they are able to.
---
I was wondering last week if this thing exists or not. As in the other thread written my main interest in gw2 is also the story, so while I'm really new here, sooner and later I would need my own version of this chart. But this way I don't have to do it manually, so thanks!
---
And additional idea: it would be fun to see which storyline was done with which character. Maybe some color coding could work there.
---

Expansion 3 will almost definitely have new mounts, or a way to acquire the PoF mounts if you don't have PoF.
---
hahaha the dodge+chair bug was around for w5+6 chairs but after update it no longer works. but looks like the bug is now on w7 chair heh
---
Yep. And when you smack them in 1v1 you get rage whispers in German. About 10% anti-Semitic. If you then politely answer in German that they should at least learn to insult in English, you get one last insult, in German ofc, and get blocked
---
It would be volatile afaik, but none of them actually are worthwhile for gold, considering how often you'd have to use them to break even compared to simply convert the gems you spend into gold in the first place.

It was too challenging for challenged people. Literally. They said they didn't want to exclude people that were physically challenged from the mount, after one made a request on the forums, so they changed it. Has nothing to do with endgame being too hard or not.
---
That's \*all\* ground targets not Renegade specific, btw. I play a power chrono and all my wells and gs3 skills are having issues.
---
True. But its about time for other countries to get involved.  
---
Lootboxes being banned in just a few countries isnt gonna change anything. Access to the lootboxes will simply be restricted for those countries, while the lootbox system persists.  
---
The only way to make game devs change their mind on this is to hit them in their wallet. Unfortunately that includes game devs with less nefarious lootbox practices.

&gt; Difference is that the MF removes the need to pay in order to ”gamble” in it
---
You don't need to buy keys to gamble with Black Lion Chest. You can just farm keys by creating character and completing map with them. Yes you can gamble easily with real money, but same goes about MF gamble. Instead of farming gold to buy exotics you can just convert gems to gold
---
&gt; I need to pay money for it
---
You "may" and "can" pay money, but you don't need to.
---
Because in current society money &gt; moral. If you have money you have everything you wanna. Even human life.

All the songs are either original to gw2 or somewhat mixed from guild wars 1 + the expansions. Also there are multiple ones that can play in a zone.

Atleast the collections that make you lap dragonfall end after the third or so time? Scales -&gt; sick -&gt; eggs if I recall the order correctly.
---
I agreed that that part was tedious, but then you get to play other maps atleast. Making it less draining on atleast me personally.
---
Yes and no!
---
While i think the ban of Lootboxes like Hextech-Chests in LoL or the Lootboxes in EVERY EA-Game are a good thing, because you get stuff (Champions,Football-Players, Star-Wars Heroes) that is actually making you stronger is okay,the "other" Lootboxes like Overwatch, Masterwork-Chests (LoL) or those in Guild Wars 2 are purely cosmetic!
---
And to gamble for cosmetics is nothing bad in my opinion! (Considering the fact most skins can't be distinguished when players are using 1500 stupid glowing-infusions!)
---
Skyscale is easier and cheaper than a leggy so it's not that outlandish.
---
Sure but that's not a WvW thing. That's a PvE and WvW thing. Everyone needs to get that done. Many people do it by rote, just to have some anyway. I know some WvW guys who think I might need celestial at some point, better have some charged quartz. In either case, it doesn't put WvW at a specific disadvantage, which is my point.
---
I don't agree.
---
The player base has no way of knowing how good they actually are. When you don't use a DPS meter then you only see those big numbers on your screen and think "well I do a lot of damage" but turns out you don't really.
---
The problem is the different situation you are in. You can do AND complete raids or any more difficult content by just knowing what it is about and with the appropriate gear (that includes exotics) but since general PvE needs to apply to every player there is you have a very low bar for players to play the game. So you have players that potentially never set foot in a group, feel like the king of the world by doing 20K one time damage and then they think they can do raids and get stomped into the ground.
---
So the problem is really on a few levels.
---
1. The content in the game is too easy especially the core game (not just because of elite specs) and the players are not trained or challenged for what might await them when they reach the max level, probably out of fear that they just quit the game but without a subscription model ArenaNet is dependent on a large audience that spends money in the gem store
---
2. There is no clear indication on how strong you actually are (native DPS meter) and the training golem lacks in that department too
---
3. The Players are oblivious to what it means to play the game in a much higher and organized level because they just don't know it better
---
There was this post of two players that I can remember who had exactly this problem in which they were criticised on how much damage they did and only after going onto metabattle or any of those build websites, installing arcdps and going to the Training golem they were able to figure out that their impression of how good they are was wrong.
---
Which, in the end, means. ArenaNet has a direction they follow and that is having a game that everyone can play which they do a darn good job with but it lacks in the departments of the more refined and specialized system that players learn what is expected of them since they will not know.
---
No one really cares about? Wow buddy, really? I have nothing else to say to you because i don't feed trolls or small minded people. Have a nice day.

Did you mix up skyscale and warclaw, or is this just a weird parable for it?

Well, it's not outward. Cause, even if it's a bit random, adds come from the left side of the pylon. But left if you're at the pylon looking to Qadim. But tbh, both ways are good. It's just about drop fireballs where adds come first
---
There've been... a handful of cases where Norn transform. In one camp where we meet up with Trahearne and the blacksmiths, there's a Norn who goes Bear when there's a fight. And the rare case here and there, random NPCs.  
---
I wanted to use the Spirit transformations because of flavour, but... It'd have been way better if the transformation just offered boosts and boons depending on the animal, without making your class and weapon meaningless. I mean, there's probably other things that factor in, but that would certainly help.
---
While I agree with you that GW2s Black lion chests are a different story and probably harmless in comparison, I was talking more about this topic in general.
---
"RIP" sounds negative to me and yet you have literally in every gaming community players crying for the abolishment of loot boxes that rely on RNG. Belgium should be praised that they take a stance to this issue.

I also started recently after a long break. In pvp I use herald and ranger. But there are 3 types of pvp: WvW Zerg, WvW/sPvP small scale, WvW/sPvP duel.
---
The ranger is pretty easy to be relevant with in all modes as long as you kite (learn to use your greatsword dash and merge with your owl for another dash and you become very hard to catch). It should be nice with a berserker friend too.
---
The herald is currently my favourite. I started with a hammer build to play in zerg fight. In big 10v10+ it deals insane aoe damage. But you wont win any duel and it doesn't have any dash (only superspeed). Small scale is 50/50.
---
I really like small scale fight so I switched to dual sword herald and after a couple days practice you will start winning some duels (against bad opponent but still muchbetter than hammer). Melee herald is very good in small scale, decent in duel and not very useful in zerg.
---
So it depends a lot on what type of pvp you want to play. Also, having good gear (full ascended), food and utility actually make a big difference. 
---
What is your favourite pvp type? Do you mostly play alone or with a friend? Do you prefer ranged or melee? If you answer that, people will be able to help pick a class for you.
---
Probably on this subreddit honestly. I’ve seen this comment a few times though never with any evidence. Just the same “game is dying” doom and gloom every game received and that GW2 has been experiencing since year 1.
---
Whatever you're smoking, it want some of it. Community? Oh yeah amazing community, people constantly shitting on each other, Troll Mesmer Portals and Blacklion Merchants in lootchests. What a truly amazing community. Oh and these amazing and challenging worldbosses.. 111111111 -&gt; Loot -&gt; Move to the next Map -&gt; wait for 15 minutes -&gt; 11111111 -&gt; Loot .. AMAZING! Also all "Meta events" if you can even call them that after HoT shouldn't even be called Meta events, because they are completely irrelevant, unlucrative and far from fun (the only exception being the most recent map).
---
Yeah thats kind of what I meant. As a race that "killed thier gods" I didnt even get a snarky "see what worshipping these things gets you?". I forget what lw season it was but the whole death oath the the human queen thing was wierd. Its like they forgot I'm a char.
---
Yes people must take a english class to play GW2. That is what i call time gate.

You had the grenade after dying perk selected, right?
---
Not possible with wvw level. The most I did was 35 in one day and I was doing it hardcore. I got 3 lvl per hour with all bonus.
---
I think you might need to precise you are talking about first language speakers because that would add up to the stats you're talking about but if you include as second language the total leads to a different ranking which is what people seem to be interpreting but that ranking is also noted as not reliable.
---
It's also a statistic that is not entirely accurate and probably have areas of overrepresentation because of how it's collected.
---
French is my first language and Brumepierre sounds so stupid to me lol.

I can't stand this game in my own language to be honest, the voices and the localization have always made me grimace.

"Of course I can't play in my native language, I never could."
---
I wonder why it's an issue for so many people. In my native country (Hungary) most people under the age of 35 has learnt English for 12-13 years of school. Of course they might not be very skilled in it, but following a WvW zerg is not brain surgery.
---
&gt; Then again, you can buy the gems with gold and what is in them can be bought from the TP and is for convenience.

I'm fairly sure there are items in the BLCs that actually cannot be sold, though.

Expansion 3. OMEGALUL.

Of course, but the Skins, Glyphs, Gathering nodes, Contracts are all being able to sell on the TP. The only thing I can find right now which player might want is the Branded Relic Package which can only be obtained through the chest and is account bound.
---
Running into that with dagger storm feels amazing.

Let's just say more Steves make it too confusing

I didn't say they should believe it.

&gt; And to gamble for cosmetics is nothing bad in my opinion!
---
So gambling isn't okay if you get your dopamine rush from getting more powerful ingame, but it's okay if your dopamine rush comes from getting cosmetics.
---
No. Wrong.
---
Gambling is gambling, and as long as you leave this loophole of "gambling for cosmetics is perfectly fine!" then we'll continue to have this pestilence forced upon us.
---
I vote for Qpert
---
Except you're trying to do the same thing to them, just in the opposite direction.
---
Season 1 was not Living Story as we know it now and Season 2 barely is with its 2 free maps, we have an established expansion to living story to expansion system now. They were effectively Living Story Beta and not reflective of where we are now. 
---
It will be interesting what they do with the new season because the last two seasons have used their respective expansions mastery points, mechanics and maps. If LS5 is independent from PoF they won't be able to use those, it's certainly uncharted territory. Although imagine it'll just be the case that LS5 will be mechanically a PoF season.
---
My guild is already complaining that they don’t want to speak English in there free time. And never want to speak baguette...
---
I think it’s much better than always the same enemies and linking partners.
---
Btw just playing a game itself can contribute to learning English. At least back in the day I got tons of my English vocabulary from DnD and CRPGs. I wonder on a basic zerg-follower level what words they need to understand - stack, wait, go/push, boost, left/right. It's true for scouting and roaming they may need more English skill.
---
&gt; It would be gambling with real money. So let's close the game
---
Fine with me. I'll just stick to FFXIV which doesn't have any of this at all.
---
Mechacharizard is the only logical suggestion there.
---
Yo are you actually playing the game?
---
You know what killed german servers? Being FULL while stuck in T5 without a link while (literally every single) international server gets a link and can recruit. 
---
T5 has been oktoberfest for 2 years straight and its killed half the german servers; only ones remaining being the ones that get links. Baruch is no different, went from regularly contesting T1 / T2 / T3 with insane coverage to losing plenty of players and guilds over time. 
---
And the french? They need 3 links of PPT heavy servers nowadays.
---
National servers are, as far as the game goes, already pretty dead. Because these changes came 2 years too late and linkings effectively destroyed them.
---
the Qadimp guy is annoying af, constantly spamming mapchat in Aerodrome and stuff.
---
Thats reason enough to be against Qadimp.
---
Ask a guildie?!
---
The split between guilds and pugs exists in all servers, different goals/commitment will make that happen and can't be helped.
---
But this change won't bring people closer, it'll just add another variable that ruptures the little teamwork and cooperation that are left even more. It'll add to the frustration of the few dedicated open commanders left that carry the servers.
---
In various servers it's hard to fill a squad even when there are queues in the map, it's even harder to convince people who want to zerg to do it with classes/builds that will actually help. Now we'll have to also deal with even more people who won't join or come on voice because they aren't comfortable with a different language.
---
It's a recipe for disaster.
---
Actually, if I were Anet and wanted to finish off WvW for good and make that game-mode's community leave the game, I'd probably consider doing this.
---

&gt;We're going to the Blood Legion homelands in season 5. You heard it here first, people.

I've been saying Blood Legion/Charr Homelands for S5 since A Bug in the System. So nope, didn't hear it here first. :P
---
The legislation has been framed as "protecting children from sneaky online gambling schemes designed to exploit them" and I cannot begin to explain how much power comes from wanting to *not* be the person who voted *against* protecting children from exploitation - especially when it becomes re-election time.

---
hahaha
---
Why am i a leech now?
---
I join wvw to get some shit done, no commanders on the map no groups no lfg... just because i don‘t command i am not a leech
---
Fun fact: the place marked as Blood Legion Homelands, isn't where the capital of the Blood Legion is located. It's actually located east, which has a ton of room in the world map canvas seen in the gw.dat (but is hidden in-game atm).
---
They also only updated the map there once, when updating the dragonbrand for the beginning S4.
---
And literally any part of your posts refutes what I said in exactly *what* way?
---
&amp;nbsp;

No? None of it?

Well then. Thanks for further demonstrating my point.

Join discord/teamspeak and ask there. Wvw isn't organized in lfg.
---
We saw others do so, such as in the Vabbi map. But all Awakened who were able to Awakened others did so by channeling Joko's power (even while he was trapped in the Domain of the Lost).
---
I'm voting for Madiq
---
Eh, I disagree.
---
On 1: They've done starter zone additions before (see Joko invasions for a fairly recent example), and are not opposed to having community events in those zones (both world boss community events, including the one going on right now, affect 4 of 5 starter zones).
---
On 2: It would just be a brief event, like the Mordrem Invasions they did for HoT, and they did an open world pvp or similar activity for nearly every BWE finale. No longer than a week at best, but more likly just a weekend.
---
That said, I doubt they'd redo that event, given they seem to enjoy such events fitting into the story somehow, and Kralk is dead. Though I guess a surviving dragon champion like the Shatterers could pull it off, similar to how Tequatl got a revamp as part of the story post-Zhaitan's death.
---
What server are you on?
---
You join WvW to get shit done - that's great. But clearly you don't get anything done and aren't trying either. 
---
There's sufficient PLAYERS to get shit done on literally every international EU server. There's just no commanders, no groups and no LFG because this game is about leeching. About making other people run groups / command / lfg so the players can "not leech" but magically play whenever they want, whatever they want on their conditions because the map is for everyone!!!!
---
Until everyone who actually runs groups / leads / gets anything done leaves because truthfully gw2 players are entitled leeches. 
---
If you ACTUALLY want to get shit done, go do stuff. It's not hard. Clearly by our own admission you need commanders and groups and lfgs to cater to you. Join a guild! GL
---
The (Death-Branded) Shatterers?
---
Kralkatorrik may be dead, but he'd still have hundreds of minions, still capable of spreading corruption. Just as Tequatl did in S1.

---
Thank you very much for taking your time to make this fun project! I've been working on playing through every possible story branch and alternative mission over the years, and this lovely chart helps tremendously with figuring out the routes.
---
The personal story is a diamond in the rough in that while some instances have had more work done on them than other, more fully fleshed out ones, every single diverging path ultimately combines into a complex narrative whole which really shows off the nuances and ambition of the storytelling and the careful seeding of ideas and characters through all the five races' and the orders' stories. To truly "get" the GW2 story as intended by developers, one needs to play through every one of these story instances which have lots of intriguing lore and interesting character interaction not to mention all the worldbuilding for the world of Tyria, sometimes even on multiple characters (e.g. some alternative lines for female charr/norn, humans of different faiths, and asura of different colleges, for example). :)
---
I see the giant wood/stone heads that look over Wychmire Swamp and the great jungle wurm, personally.
---
Wow.  It was a statement of fact and nothing more.  For the record, my post history on this subject should make it pretty clear that I'm not okay with this.
---
This is great and looks like a ton of fun! I appreciate you burning up your phone to write it all down for me, haha!
---
Yeah I noted his other post. In all fairness, RS is the deadest server in the game at this point and it's only HALF because the remaining people there are obnoxious leeches. The other half is the fact that anet made everyone half capable transfer or ragequit the game due to their neglect towards national servers.
---
But hey 2 years after these issues really showed themselves in constant T5-yet-full matchups they're going to try something new next relink. Surely, SURELY that's not too late right?
---
Not all alternate skins get effects in the version that looks more polished.
---
Some are msotly reskins, like Kenshi's Blade, Knot of Justice, Infinite Wisdom, Twin Sisters, Siren's Call...
---
Looks like the Treeheart models in general.
---
Whatever your stance is, your post is written in a way that only seeks to water down the idea of lootboxes into something less objectionable.

---
We have never seen all of Kryta, never seen all of Ascalon, the Maguuma Jungle/Wastes/Heart, Orr or the Shiverpeaks. We never will. The world is too big to realize every little corner.
---
Personally I’m glad if we move away from Elona (and hopefully some human-lore as well)
---
Faolain is tired of your bad jokes
---
I never want to hear about human lore again. Give the norns some love.
---
South, to Charr Homelands!
---
For someone who belongs to a well knownish wvw guild I feel incredibly stupid right now.
---
Happy hunting! :)
---
I'm not defending it, only calling it what it is.
---
I like it better on high heh
---
So he chose not to kill someone he love after all.
---
Happy hunting!

I'm from the Netherlands too and can confirm this. Personally I pretty much refuse to speak Dutch when there are non Dutch people there. If I'm playing a game with 3 Dutch people and 1 non Dutch, I'm gonna force everyone to English. Most are perfectly fine with that fortunately :)
---
One way or another they don't want to affix a set price to the BL chest exclusives anywhere because it would cause an outrage for all the people still stuck under the RNG price scheme.  Converting keys, which have a set value in gems, into something else wouldn't really solve the issue, and there would need to be a gem equivalency placed on the statuettes as well since you would need 100 keys (8400 gems or ~$100) worth of keys to get something like a mining node with statuettes.  Again, generating a whole lot of WTFs and likely costing them customers.
---
The best answer here is to abolish this system and move to set pricing per item everywhere because the current system for getting BL exclusives is nothing but exploitive.

He was hurting, and confused. We just took one of his eyes.  So he couldn't even see well. 
---
At that moment he was too busy running away to check where he finished the commander.
---
The corruption probably completely took over what was left of him, and all he could think of was going back to the mists and eat magic to heal.
---
I kept my OG dungeon runner bag style. "Show bags", minimum window sized for one 24-slot, invis bag on bottom for gear.
---
I actually run two invis bags for my mains, one 24 slot for trinkets and armor, and another for weapons. I also have at least 20 slot bandoliers or WvW bags, craftibg bags, and since leather used to be cheaper, trash item bags.
---
Earthim, Windim and Blazeim it is then.

No it's not. Doesn't matter how bad a messenger is, it doesn't change the message.
---
This doesn't necessarily mean "more sand". The rest of Istan is a mixture of jungle and swamp. The Keys, yes, more sand, but they're not typical desert sand.  They're beach sand and islands.
---
Kourna offers more Savannah-esque areas like the part of Jahai where we fight the Death-Branded Shatterer.  The entire Marga Coast from Gw1 looked like that. (Area west of Domain of Kourna)
---
Kind of the same with Vabbi, though in Gw1 it was mostly rocky and mountainous.  I'm expecting the same of Dzlana, but idk.  That could be anything-even an icy area because of a raptor skin name.
---
The point is, there is so much more to see that doesn't translate to "more sand".
---
Screw them. EN default.

The only barrier to entrance is buying a commander tag or finding a friend who has one.

If i’m still using seaweed salad. Does it count that I have the disease?

I literally called it a dream in the first comment. I know it's never going to happen. Quit being condescending for two seconds and read what someone wrote before you queue up your snark. Anything to do with an MMO always has the worst goddamn community.
---
TBH that's the way I learned english. By being forced to interact with people in foreign language. IMO national servers should have been removed ever since introduction of megaserver, but better late than never I guess.

I have seen people say it's an official retailer but I do not see them on the gw2 site official retailer lists?

How about Quadim the Peelless ? The infusion kinda looks like onion..
---
I thought its name was Bubbles...
---
The only RNG associated with cigarrettes is the RNG you were born with. You get what you pay for with them.
---
He left us because he knew that if we tried to kill him with Aurene dead we would destroy Tyria. Kralk clearly showed he was intelligent.
---
I don't refute your statement about FF14 being successful? Only the point that gambling have something to do with game being successful or not
---
&gt; Haven't been in the game for a while to witness the actual outcome of all this
---
Tested it in raids, in party - all was ok with me and 3 of my friends, so that's why i'm sure that this "not enough test bla-bla" is bullshit. They don't test half of their changes. Looks at what going on with W6B1. But here? It's just funny.
---
The terror has many names
---
also the "commander" itself isnt a big threat to kralkk , its like saying why didnt he kill braham aswell :D
---
The point is - it will be never painted like this, because you first need for this project to be acknowledgement. And this project will just disappear in "paper work" for next 2000 years

This community has a weird fetish for Steve's.
---
WTH? There’s nothing wrong with getting excited over a new mount skin, especially when it’s a nice springer skin like this one.
---
Oh boi, Babel.
---
Because 90%+ of players want to play a game instead of going to work.
---
I was completely serious when I implied that Belgian politicians would like to buy gamble keys in a video game
---
In all fairness, there were a ton of absolutely broken player mechanics at that time like full party distortion from a single chrono.
---
She’s just fine the way she is. I enjoyed her reaction so much.😊
---
If I wanted faked over-reacting I would watch an Aurora Peachy stream.
---
A lot of MMO's have a SINGLE gear set for each class to wear. Keeping up with skill changes is normal, but having to also keep up with stat changes is really burdensome to casual players. Old raid builds are pretty bad or non-existent at this point. Having full commander chronos and a condi vanilla ranger wouldn't fly in any raid anymore.
---
Trying to kill the most basic enemy in fulll magi, minstrel or harrier take ages. It's not fun.
---
Shit didn‘t know that wvw community is toxic like that.
---
I do get shit done. I just cant capture forts and towers on my own, maybe i just suck.
---
In my opinion joining a commander is not leeching it‘s beeing part of the group and working together. Like in every other game mode.
---
Reported
---
What does this even mean
---
It keeps the surprise effect for those browsing.
---
I'm the only crazy one so far with one type of bag in just about every character.
---
Shared inventory- stacking consumables &amp; QOL items I need for everyone.
---
Equipment at the top, constantly opening unids and salvaging.
---
Oiled next- keeps junk out of the other bags, empties out at merchant.
---
Craftman's... Material one- keeps salvaged mats together until i sell off extras that stick around after deposit.
---
Backpack somewhere in there, holds on to sort of important or persistent things, but not the SUPER important things.
---
Invisible- Super important things.
---
The first three bags are kept as empty as possible. Most of what I need is in the last two. Show bags always on.
---
It’s not a story Steve would tell you
---
Being linked with a national server wont necessarily lower the amount of people joining discord or ts because the ones already motivated to do so will still be on voice regardless of linking. And what better way to follow a commander who does not speak your language but tells you key words to follow than on voice? Would one rather try to google translate a textmander of a foreign language? I can only speak from personal experience and it’s not as a bad as one might think it is to be on a foreign language ts/discord as long as you are given the basic “commands” to do your part on the squad/objectives.
---
Power Banner Warrior is still better than power Beserker if you need CC. It is a meta build.
---
If you’re god tier at your rotation, Condi Engi is viable (but not top tier)
---

Qadim means "Old" in Arabic, just call him Jadeed ("New" in Arabic).

&gt; I do get shit done. I just cant capture forts and towers on my own, maybe i just suck.

So do or don't you get shit done? 
---
&gt; In my opinion joining a commander is not leeching it‘s beeing part of the group and working together. Like in every other game mode. 
---
Yet you admit you don't even know about their TS and have never been there. In my experience, everyone wants a commander to do whatever they please around so they can roleplay as "helping" but most players are deadweight that won't listen and you don't want around. And when eventually these players leave / quit / transfer the other players can't play the game anymore.
---
Following a commander isn't necessarily leeching; not being able to play without a group that carries you is. 
---
That said i'll happily admit RS has it worse than most servers, given that many of the players who were really getting stuff done left / quit due to anet's abuse.

I never said they were bad. It is just the truth that they are controversial, and it's clear that lots of people would not have liked them, thus making it questionable why they would waste time and effort in making them that way, or not fixing them.

*Secret Raptor finds your lack of damage...disturbing.*

I don't even have the rollerbeetle or griffon lol.

I don't even know half of those. Why are you assuming I'm level 80?
---
Without expansions you  cannot even get in raids, so this question is purely academic.
---
I'm trying my best to improve D:
---
Why can't you?
---
&gt; Yes. If the game NEEDS to take advantage of people to exist then I'd rather it be gone.
---
Agreed.
---
Personally, I buy the karmic retribution FIRST every time a new map comes out because I know I'll be playing there while I complete story and achievements so I may as well get some karma while I'm at it.
---
Sure but I certainly never cleared Wing 1 at release with that stuff.
---
Recruiter, obviously. Thy woud seller put up a french flag.
---
When you say stackable consumables for across characters, what do you mean by that? My shared inventory slots have been empty for a while, save my copper salvager... I used to use it for switching my infinite gathering tools around, but I started swapping so much, I forgot.
---
Also I don't think any of the Elder Dragons want to destroy Tyria you know they would be killed too. On a bit of tangent my preferred story episode 5 and on wards would have been Aurene stays dead, episode 6 is broadly the same minus the mist instance (even though I've never seen anything like it in an MMO and I love it). We take the war to Kralk and we lose badly and during our one on one fight with him, the gods return and they kill him and take his magic however there would be a cliff hanger that shows the gods aren't to be trusted as they turn their magic on us and our allies but before they can hurt us something ports us out of there to Arah. Between season 4 and 5 current events happen and these are showing how the gods are taking places of power all over Tyria and Elona so Kormir gets Elona, Melandru takes over the Jungle, Dwayna gets Kryta, Lyssa gets the shiverpeaks and Grenth gets Orr. Episode 1 of season 5 opens with us in hiding from the gods and E sends us a mail telling us to get out of Tyria and to flee to Cantha to find Kunavang. So we find a way to get past Steve and get into Cantha who are unaware of what is happening. Season 5 just to end this would have taken place completely in Cantha trying to rebuild our army after our final battle with Kralky and then the next expansion would be about taking the fight back to Tyria kind of in a Cataclysm way where its completely different. But this is unlikely to happen because of the core personal story, living world etc. So thats how I would have liked this season to end and how season 5 to go. I know barely anyone will like this but I just need to get it down somewhere. For the record I love the episode 6 story.
---
It's an awful idea. They should be moving to GW1-like districts where players can choose the language they prefer (even those not officially supported by the game's localization), not the other way around.
---
Megaservers hurt PvE communities a lot, and nowadays they're still a big problem for new players, who always find themselves surrounded by people who don't speak their languages (even when their language has dedicated servers).
---
There are a lot of people who have no idea about English, and most who do suck at actually speaking it, which is going to turn voice communication into a hellscape.
---
Classy Americans having no idea how Europe works whatsoever.
---
Yes, Ether Djinn's tokens instead of Qadim's tokens.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I mean... Germans already don't understand megaservers and you'll get the occasional "hey wie bekommt man [Random Item]?" in a Lions Arch map that spoke english for the last 9 hours and nobody responds to them &lt;3
---
That's not fun in any way whatsoever. Those kind of players will just stop playing.
---
shouldve went with a 55 monk
---
I'm pretty sure they said they were not planning on changing anything about LWS1 IIRC?
---
I explained the warclaw in another comment up. It does so little damage to gates, only three can pull on gates at the same time, and the bleeding on engage skill was removed, which was really the only thing that did and significant damage.
---
The skyscale has a lot of flaws, but you are correct on the vertical fly limit I guess.
---
TP: You can buy or sell at a maximum of 250 at a time, it's very slow to open, buy and sell, and you can't "sell items too fast."
---
Bounties give little reward to do them, and most champion bounties that do not give collection items are never done. People who also want to do bounties are discouraged by the incredibly long wait time to gather a team if it doesn't give any good rewards. The bounties themselves work fine, that was not my issue.
---
I like this game despite it's flaws, but with every update made I get confused as to why they even decided to do such a thing. Just today WvW language restrictions were removed, for some reason.

 Have a good weekend as well.

On a serious note: it's not too late. You may be a little overwhelmed but you'll easily get back.

No, the spec has been gutted to the point of raid or don't play this at all.

I dunno man, I find it quite interestin how he managed this whole thing. Been a while since I've had such a good laugh
---
LOL!!! Okay noted
---
If your healing is good, your dps is low, if your dps is good, your healing is bad. Druid really only works well as a healer in group content and not really fun solo, otherwise you can drop the staff and build for dps, but soulbeast is better for that
---
Could go for QTP... I mean he's called Qadim The Peerless.
---
OMG that's it! Wow thanks! Gonna go do it later. The ending of it was pretty epic.
---
Okay thanks for the headsup. Ill stick with my guardian

It’s known as the Leeroy Jenkins

Yet the commander overcame the dragons encountered - Leeroy died on the wing of Onyxia's lair

Much better on High.

To be fair on/off consists of changing a 0 to a 1 like 90% of the time in programming.

Boon thief/Heal thief

I think you're failing to see how complex this issue actually is from a legal perspective.  There are level of legal padding that will need to be addressed as part of any serious legislative attempt to reign these thing in.  The system is designed to separate you from your money in such a way that you can't get it back before you even use any of your "ability to access content and services" as the gem store ToS calls it.  
---
Now that you are already permanently separated from your money, let's go deeper:  
---
1. You are not gambling legally because you are using *the ability to access content and services* (gems)  
---
2. Gems are not a real currency and so are outside the power of governments to control (You have already lost your real money, it's gone and you can't have it back)  
---
3. We do not own anything inside the game.  We buy the game and sign the ToS saying nothing inside the game is ours, not our account and not our info.  We are (through Anet) renting access to processor time, communication bandwidth and physical storage media. (We do not own anything in the game, not even our own names or any information we expose through the game)  
---
4. So we don't own the gems, we don't own the items we get with gems and in fact anything gotten with gems was not obtained with real money.(As far as the law is concerned, these things don't even exist, only the physical media exists legally as of the last time I read into it)  
---
5. We "gamble" in game with things that don't belong to us and were not obtained with real money.  There are no stakes here, therefore you can not ever gain anything of real value, and you never (legally) lose anything of *real* value.  
---
**TLDR:  The system is set up so that anyone "gambling" is doing so with currencies that do not exist in reality and have no real life value, inside of something that itself doesn't even exist as far as the law is concerned.**  
---
This is the level of BS that serves as legal padding for "gem stores" across the gaming industry before you can even begin to talk about the gambling angle...  I have never heard of a casino needing this level of legal fuckery at the foundation just to operate.  
---
So now let's chat a minute about the gambling angle.  Even not withstanding the legal things above that have stripped you of any legal claim to these things being gambling, feeding BL keys into the chests isn't any different from playing a slot machine... However, this slot machine's only "payout" is one of a very few items that can exclusively be gotten from BL chests.  Assuming you're buying gems to purchase keys to get this item, you are losing with every single key you put into a chest.  
---
Eventually you (legally don't) get something (that has no legal value anyway).  What were you even putting your money into then?  Perception of the user says "I was putting money into keys to get an item."  In other words your perception says you were throwing money at something until something you wanted popped out with no idea how much money you would have to throw at it before your thing appeared.  That isn't even gambling.  In fact it sounds more like insanity on the part of the user because they're being tricked by their own perception into playing a rigged game with real money that is completely separate from the legal constructs that have ben built around the experience.  So this is outright dishonesty using human psychology (immersion in the game) to separate us from what is actually happening in the "real world" over which we have layed a lattice work of legal abstractions that can result in real concequences.  
---
To be blunt, the game industry has found a legal way to fuck people out of their money using the game as means of lowering their guard.  
---
Lootboxes aren't even gambling, if you're arguing gambling then you're barking up the wrong legal tree.  It's an outright scam.
---
Even from a real world business/retail perspective the only reason something like this would not already be illegal would be because nobody even thought about it when defining in law what is illegal in the practice of business.  To that, I have not been able to determine myself if selling an item for a price that is random/undetermined is defined anywhere.  The simplest hypothetical I can think of for this situation is going to a cash register and having the same item ring up at a different price every single time.  Customers aren't going to put up with this, and if this behavior isn't legally defined it's because nobody thought they were clever enough to get away with it.  You can't even call it the "dumb white bitch price" because the RNG is indescriminate.  So this business is randomly screwing people on the price of this item.  At a minimum, that's going to result in an avalance of lawsuits that would put giants like Walmart underwater... Not here because they've built in layers of legal BS to stop reprocussions, and the entire industry is engaging in it.  
---
Back to the slot machine analogy, the use of one at the time RNG keys is simply a method of hiding the fact that they are selling you something at an undetermined price, and a potential red herring in court proceedings because they've already legally nullified that argument pretty thoroughly... Likely having guessed something like this would eventually come up.  
---
Did you actually realize any of this was going on before making your assumption about my statement?  Do see now just how unethical the system is and how your argument of gambling has already been considered by them and that very arguement has already been shot down as far as the courts are concerned by existing laws and the ToS we all agree to just for access to the software?  This is NOT simple, do not try to make it simple because simple will not produce something capable of fixing the problem.  
---
This is a very carefully crafted scam, and the apparent gambling part is just another way to obscure what is actually going on here.
---
3rd party software and legendary armor should not be the only solutions lmao. there should be an option to disable transparency or adjust it.
---
It became garbage tier when they nerfed druid pets.
---
Druid is a failure of game design. It should have a DPS build option to choose if you don't want to heal (think a solar burn condi build) that sacrifices all of the healing for strong condi dps. Instead it's got a full list of traits which 2/3 never get used and it's solely a healer. The only spec in the game gimped so badly. The pet DPS nerf for druid means there is no viable build other than healing.
---
It could be a fantastic spec if they play the celestial theme, tease out the solar/burning celestial aspect for DPS, leave the lunar aspect for healing and allow two different build paths, but right now it's a one trick raid pony that is more shallow than a puddle a day after the rain.
---
First I chuckled.
---
Then I remembered how unfinished the whole Nightmare Court story is and got all sad inside. 
---
( u.u )
---
Build templates are actually coming to the game though.
---
Obviously that doesn't help you now but it might fix that situation for the future.
---
I need this.  Something like how we can make chat screen dark. White text is super hard to read for me unless it's thickly outlined in black.

If the EU did it that might do the trick.

---
Thread removed: Begging is not allowed.
---
Gambling creates unhappy customers. Addiction and other life problems have become more powerful than customer satisfaction so games get away with it, but a relationship with your customers built off of dissatisfaction in an attempt to milk more money is fundamentally unhealthy.
---
did they even give an ETA on templates? i don't remember there being one. 
---
even with templates the inventory is still stupid as fuck though there's no reason it should be the way it is. i don't remember it being this bad either
---
&gt; As the developers have catered so much to the least involved player
---
And thus' the problem with Gw2.
---
Though, there is more at play here.  ANET *wants* the players too be only superificially interested, because they are the ones more likely to spend money in the gemstore. That seems like an oxymoron, so I'll try to explain very briefly.
---
Think back to when you were a kid playing Pokemon Red&amp;Blue. You would mash A button to skip all NPC dialogue. It wasn't that you weren't interested in story. You enjoyed the spectacle of being part of the bigger world. But you weren't interested in slowly reading dialogue. You just wanted to go from one major spectacle to the next, rushing the game.
---
That describes the mentality of the GW2 playerbase. All the new players don't really care who Braham, or how they met them. They aren't deeply immersed in the lore. They just press the level 80 boost, grab the raptor, and move on from one big story beat to the next. They don't know or care who Balthazar is, but they feel excited when they kill them. They enjoy the feeling of heroism.
---
This is why ANET puts so much effort into the Kralkatorrik flying instance, despite being nothing more than a glorifying cutscene with shit replay value. Because it gives people those people that rush story the dopamine-high of spectacle and heroism.
---
But then players finish the story, and they can't play anymore. The story chapter ends, but leaves just a bit of dissatisfaction in the player. But they still crave the dopamine rush. So ANET releases a 2000 gems mount skin on the gemstore, which players buy in order to fill that void. 
---
To be very clear, I'm not saying ANET maliciously preys on human psychology. That's just normal marketing, and I honestly find it genius. The LS4 model is so financially successful for them that they're releasing LS5 instead of Expansion \#3.
---
For this same reason, ANET sees LS1 as financially unviable because these players who are dopamine-addicts don't care about the backstory. They just want too be in an epic setpiece, whether they understand the story or not.
---
ANET knows *exactly* what they are doing. And they are giving these players *exactly* what they want.
---
32 slot bags give you over 300 slots. Do you really need more? 
---
Plus if you really run out get a bank contract? 
---
They’re all expensive in the end but when you look at the price of bag slots it ends up being quite relative and similar in price even if exchanging gems for gold.
---
How is transparency becoming an issue?
---
Also for an easier time switching gear use the hero panel and/or put all your gear in invisible bag at the bottom of your inventory, then you will know where it is and when it switches out it will be put into the same slots, switching from 2 1 handed weapons to a 2 handed will cause one to go to the first available slot though.

Is this the wing with Daimos?
---
The problem is the crazy healing it has if you don't stun it at 50%.
---
this is written like someone who only logged onto reddit to shit on gw2 and make assumptions about other people's purchasing habits.
---
 the issue is that the law doesnt forbid them from choosing shitty things that they only refrain from doing because of the insane backlash it would cause. Amazing that you somehow know of Anet shoving things down my throat that even i dont know about. Dont you think the issue is people who make assumptions like these without the knowledge to understand they are missing information? Isnt that how people are fooled into buying shitty games in the first place?
---
Thanks, is 20s a cutoff of some sort?  Like, feed it as much as you can for 20s and whatever you weren't able to you'll have to wait a couple hours to try again?
---
In response to your edit: I don't think they've ever said anything about it. Probably because it's never been brought up as a problem before.
---
Ah, yeah, the API is down. :/ hopefully it'll be back up later though! :)
---
I never run max shaders and postprocessing. Imho the first makes the game uglier, the second much harder to see things xd
---
Looks like garfiels to me
---
Base warrior banners is meta if you need frequent cc.
---
Condi engi is still good, although it usually overshadowed by holo.
---
Core guardian I want to say is still good, but is overshadowed by DH.
---
Boon/heal thief is meta on 1-2 bosses.
---
Condi base ranger is a solid okay, but is strictly worse than condi soulbeast
---
i've seen plenty of posts on reddit and their forums but most are old i guess anet has never responded and people just deal with it now
---
Internal strife between the charr legions would be pretty interesting, leading us to visit the charr lands to the east. 
---
I'd personally prefer that or a visit into the tengu lands behind the wall which leads up to a Cantha expansion.
---
&gt; One time I reached out to a Scourge (in whisper) that was doing below boon chrono damage. Turned out he was knowingly using support Scourge in a pug already having Chrono+Druid (he admitted to using ArcDPS). After I called him out he immediately switched to a proper dps class.
---
That's an example for a good end, but I never denied that this happens too. However, a proper arrangement would do the same job.
---
I still prefer SSJ Qadim
---
Thanks
---
There used to be a Raptor Jesus up in the sky @ WvW too, somewhere around the south side of Stonemist Castle. He disappeared some years ago though, so I guess this is his second coming?
---
I'm still not sure whether I like that GW2 has no [damage types](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Damage_type) or not. On the one hand, it streamlines combat and build crafting and removes the very likely nagging feeling of needing to minmax for each encounter; on the other, it makes little sense that fire elementals can burn and that you can even blind dredge now, and combat becomes less deep. 
---
Dunno, maybe the time for such mechanics simply has passed as the world became so much quicker, and these things in action combat video games are more of a hassle and should be left for slower, strategy-oriented games like tabletops instead...
---
In the past some people used to run condi/hybrid druid for open world or just zerker. But over time druid got nerfed so hard and the stat reduction of pets simply killed it. Druid lost a lot of stability, boons are harder to upkeep,grace of the land got removed,glyph of empowerment got removed, dmg from pets is simply trash now. Only saving grace is the 10-man spirits but that's it. I wouldnt even touch druid outside of raids atm,sometimes i see it in fractals but its pretty weak there as well compared to other support/healers.  These are very dark times for what used to be one of the best pve specs.
---
No, you get to throw 4 bits of food at it before you're locked out for the day. (The lockout might not be 24h now, some stuff was changed)
---
Logic says so. Not being irrational says so. And it has nothing to do with your or my own opinion about how we should call the new Qadim (fyi I'm not even defending "qadimp", I personally prefer 2 or 2.0)
---
Isn't China GW2 almost dead? 
---
Sounds bad, but I hope so, if that's the problem that prevent Cantha.
---
Huh.. I would assume it works the same way as the Astral weapon collection, but it's not worded the same way. Hmmm... I wouldn't gamble and just do 6 different weps, personally.
---
I appreciate how well this post demonstrates the difference there can be between the people who vote on the post and the people who discuss the post

Im a new player and have played a few classes for a few hours each but still figuring out what to make. Its confusing with the elite specializations that completely change the character and also weapon types seem to change playstyle too. Theres so many variables. I just heard of spellbreaker and it looks kind of cool and I think warrior in general is likely a good option. I was just looking for some input. I like a high mobility counter type class. I play mostly wow and like the winwalker monk and demon hunter. They are very agile duelist specializations that can cc, kite, and go toe to toe with most other classes. I have a level 11ish mesmer and like some things about it. Is there a mesmer spec that is a good fighter? Is spellbreaker a good option? they dont seem to have good mobility from what Ive seen. Theif looks good of course but I dont really like either one of the elite specializations from what I have seen. I dont want to be a ranged character at all. Do I have to choose an elite specialization or are the base classes as strong? I am really confused about the revenant and what they do. Are there any classes where I can play one type of weapon and dont have to constantly change weapon types. This game just seems really overwhelming so far.
---
Not on the same level as HoT did for Sylvari.
---
Random gossiping NPCs in one area will have different ambient commentary based on your race. There's one joke that changes if you're an Elementalist or Mesmer. Maybe others hidden that get tweaked. And one or two lines that change based on what god you picked as a human. But overall nothing really significant I can think of. I'd just stick with whatever character you enjoy playing.
---
Play in zergs. Killing people gives wxp.
---
There's a list of all stackable boosters on wiki.
---
That could be a good plot ultimately leading towards the fourth assault in Dragon's Stand against Mordry - the north-west one but as we know, they didn't do it (beside the partial assets visible in map itself)
---

Literally 2/3 of the current pool of Statuettes is different colors of various minis. A couple more are the plush backpack and hat, which has a veery narrow audience. Then there are 3 gathering tools which are sold directly through gem store anyway. And that leaves us with just a couple of actual items, with the only BLC RNG one being Iron Beast Greatsword. It is amazing, yes, but it is only one. Item. Per reset, which happens only once in a couple of months.   
---
This is complete bullshit, there are countless items exclusive to the random shit nature of black lion chests, which on top of that only drop for a couple of months, and then they become literally unavailable for years until Arenanet decides to bring them to the measly statuette list.
---
Not sure what you mean by proper arrangement? That's on the Scourge because common sense dictates not playing as a third support when there's already a *Chrono and Druid* in the party.
---
The other dps and I were doing 3x-4x the Scourge's dps each. Even then the party felt heavy to carry. 
---
I asked him if he uses arcdps, he said yes, then immediately switched to a dps toon (not necro). In fact, he was a decent dps that matched our above average numbers. So he was aware of his low numbers the whole time. 
---
I suspect he was using Chrono and Druid as a crutch to practice his support Scourge, which is an incredibly selfish thing to do. The decent way to go would be to practice as second support, not *third* support in a 5 man content. He thought he could get away with it too &gt;_&gt;
---
&gt; But GW2 has damage types. But it doesn't affect the combat in any way, only the enemy's death animation.
---
"Technically"... Yeah, I like that it's there as an aesthetic leftover, but it's honestly even barely noticeable in the grand scheme of things.
---
&gt; For the burn thing, I made myself the excuse that they are different kinds of fire, you know magic an stuff.
---
Bleeding doors and so on. Back when structures were immune to conditions, I remember making a suggestion to just mask conditions with a new effect called Structural Integrity or something. I mean, just winging it as it is now works too, but still...
---
&gt; There doesn't need to be damage types,
---
Sure, I mean "damage types" as a concept.
---
&gt; I think it can get a little complex to implement at some point.
---
Yup. Would kinda be okay in a D&amp;D session over a several hours, but not so much when you slay hundreds in 10 minutes.
---
CARIN!?
---
pfft that was UBRS
---
[Serious] I swear I saw an enemy named Veteran Fried Chicken Sushi at Augury Rock. I know it sounds like a troll, but I swear I'm not trolling. Please feel free to tell me if this doesn't belong here. :)
---
Earlier at the Augury Rock event, during the last battle, I swear I saw a mob named Veteran Fried Chicken Sushi. I checked twice and the name stayed that way, at least for me. However, I do not see any record of an enemy with such a name. Am I seeing things (I WAS high on 2 cups of coffee), or is this a real thing? Maybe I misread the enemy name with a player's name? But then it was red, I think it was red at least. In any case, I just need an answer to move on. Any comment is helpful.
---
You seem to have stabbed yourself in the head and neck with your shoulder gear!
---
&gt;  6 different weapons
---
Very nicely done!
---
You don't live in America and you haven't heard at all about the legislation that's already being discussed by the government about this very thing, have you?
---
You're back!  My favorite rev. Welcome back
---
&gt; Not sure what you mean by proper arrangement?
---
Talking about who play dps/support etc. 
---
&gt; because common sense dictates not playing as a third support when there's already a Chrono and Druid in the party.
---
Keep in mind that we are talking about pug groups, there are newbies even in T4. Also "common sense" doesn't necessarily mean that actually *do* know that (as you can see). 
---
I an lfg where dps join your group, even though you search for a druid (example), it just should be a thing to clearify who plays which role. Well, but ofc everybody should have an eye on this, also the scourge.
---
unfortunately you need to buy 6 recipes and craft 6 different weapons
---
Which is a tons of branded masses right? 50 each for each inscription :/
---
This setup works with ascended gear combined with build templates:
---
X Invis at the very end.
---
Universal equipment bag at second last. 
---
20 Exotic at the third last.
---
20 Rare at the forth last.
---
20 Uncommon at the fifth last.
---
X others upfront.
---
This way all ascended and common gear goes straigth to the plain equipmemt bag while all other equipmemt goes to the other bags upfront. Grey stuff and everything else also goes there. This prevents your ascended gear being in the top spots, and I really prefer it back at the end.
---
I usually have one fixed spot for the unident gear (and alike) also at the end in the invis bags. When I get to 250 I let 1 there to reserve the place and sell/salvage the rest. I do the same for ectos, and coins and stuff.
---
&gt; Bleeding doors and so on. Back when structures were immune to conditions, I remember making a suggestion to just mask conditions with a new effect called Structural Integrity or something. I mean, just winging it as it is now works too, but still...
---
Even though I rarely play WvW, I would really like that. I mean a confused door?
---
Yeah... but... I mean... It's summoned by players right? And.. Yeah and since it's a "player's" fire elemental, ofcourse it's immune against players burning! Yeah, right that's it. :P
---
I dont like damage immunities, but I personally wish that enemies could have damage resistances (certain types being less effective)
---
So for example earth elementals may be resistant to slashing (sword, greatsword, non-magic daggers) while mace, hammer and non-magic staff would deal regular damage. Similarly, bleeding may have less effect, but chill, confusion and torment are fine.
---
These damage efficiency reductions would create reasons to bring a variety of weapons and utilities, while not removing builds from casual play, just addressing their overall effectiveness.  creating niches for specific builds and adding value to underutilised builds.
---
Personally I think these will have to be added in PvE at some point or we will run put of potential for niche elite specs... (currently the soft cap is 3 per class: power, Condi &amp; support)
---
Edgelords necro set

K-train is the fastest way to get WvW ranks. You need to lead the tag yourself because most people don't k-train and the ones that do usually do it poorly. The trick is to go for guaranteed easy XP before hard XP. I have my group kill every single guard along our path unless going near them would get us ganked by enemy players. This includes veering next to SMC to kill those door guards if we are mear them. I mostly focus on capping camps, sentries, and the NPC zones. But if an enemy tower looks like I can cap it without an enemy zerg ganking us, I will do that too. Usually if I see orange swords where the enemies are fighting across the map, that means they will be too busy to defend their towers, although they almost always show up to defend T3 towers so be careful with those. According to GW2 efficiency I farmed 339 WvW levels over the last 30 days. This was using celebration bonus the whole time but not other XP boosters. I also added the guild bonus and the WvW enrichment partially through the month (I just came back to the game so had forgotten about them). I also didn't play every day that month, and didn't K-train every time I did play. Also don't listen to the people who tell you to zerg. The average K-train that I lead earns 5 to 10x the amount of WvW XP as the average zerg. A huge problem with zergs is dimishing returns. As you kill the same enemies over and over, they give less XP due to shorter lifespans.
---
I know what the balthasar one is, whats the kormir one though?
---
It'll take a long time, sure. But if you're playing the game, like I played the game, you'll have some currency from the zones, you'll get some from home instances, you'll get some from buying them in the new zone once a day, and it doesn't take that long per day to farm what you need.  It's like saying I can farm a home instance for a couple of months (which is not eternity btw) and when I'm done I'll have most of what I need for a mount without really grinding. And you get a bunch of other mats as well.
---
There are people in my guild who farm my home instance every day, just because they want the mats anyway. Every one of those people didn't grind at all, because they didn't wait to start farming home instances until the last minute.  If you're just starting now, it'll take a while, but you'll be getting lots of mats every day.
---
Oh dang, forreal? Well heck I should probably get on that, I just get so side tracked in this amazing game.
---
Thanks for that ^^
---
In the first episode of PoF LW episode there is a prison break which changes a bit depending on class as well, nothing major, though.
---
&gt;for newer players who are not familiar with some of the abbreviations
---
Sometimes that's the point. If I know who's currently on the map, I'd rather use abbreviations and slang and get reliable people who get stuff done. Toxicity, gatekeeping, whatever. If I need a strong backup quick, I don't want clueless people around..
---
All for the sake of fashion.
---
GW2 does have damage types.
---
It inherited them from GW1, but they are not considered by any kind of defense, and so they all count the same. 
---
Still, damage types do have two affects:
---
* In some events and missions, enemies are immune to most types of damage, except one set to a temporary weapon or ability given to you. 
---
* It alters the [death animation](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Damage_type) of defeated enemies: 
---
 * Physical - default damage and default death animations. 
---
 * Burning death - caused by Fire themed skills, Burning condition, and Fire damage weapons.
---
 * Freezing death - caused by Ice themed skills and Ice damage weapons. 
---
 * Shocking death - Light and lightning-themed skills and Lightning damage weapons.
---
 * Chocking death - poison themed skills and choking damage weapons.
---

Huh, I must have remembered it wrong. I remember a thread here on reddit some odd years ago discussing it. Maybe it was during beta? I have not been around since the beginning, so I wouldn't know first hand.
---
That thread may have been discussing their reintroduction possibly?
---
Just play what looks interesting or what makes the most sense. Leveling up is pretty simple so there's no need for anything specific.
---
Faolain's story was rushed in HoT due to tight schedule of developing the expansion (among other things), and she should've had more development in HoT to make her more of a tragic villain we could sympathize with a bit. :)
---
Badges were much more of a slog to get then. A lot of people called them Badges of Jumping because one of the best ways to get them was through the wvw jumping puzzles.
---
Yes, it actually does! Typed it in and not a single lfg with "]" popped up for me
---
Everything is viable, but Warrior, Thief, Engineer, and Guardian all work well without elite specs.
---
A lot of people enjoy playing core professions.
---
The Jungle Provides !
---
Ha! I had the wrong "Forearmed is Forewarned". This should be fixed now if you hard refresh.
---
Ha! I was in those maps. Some of those comments are probably mine :)
---
Some answers:
---
&gt; Do I have to choose an elite specialization or are the base classes as strong?
---
With power creep, few base classes can keep up in the hands of an *unskilled* player. I'd focus on getting one elite down first.
---
&gt; I am really confused about the revenant and what they do.
---
Revenants have stances: their utility options are locked to their stances. So they have a swap that goes with their weapon swaps that change their utilities and class skill (facets for herald, summons for kala, etc.)
---
&gt; . Is there a mesmer spec that is a good fighter? Is spellbreaker a good option? they dont seem to have good mobility from what Ive seen. Theif looks good of course but I dont really like either one of the elite specializations from what I have seen. I dont want to be a ranged character at all. 
---
Mesmers can be amazing pvp duelists in the right meta (though they have had the nerf bat hit them recently). They tend to be very evasive. So are thieves. Spellbreakers got hit with the nerfbat, but have good counters for some kinds of damage/blocks. Warrior in general is kind of tanky, and is fast/blocks things. I would recomend maybe [reading](https://whyigame.wordpress.com/the-beginners-guide-to-movement-in-combat-guild-wars-2/) (also [here](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:Level_80_Survival_Handbook_-_How_to_Solo_Anything)) or [watching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yyRWZD2-0) a guide to get a better handle of the terms used.
---
if the mount had any appeal to me, i'd have finished the collection. As it stands, I've got the map currency and the main dragonfall collections complete but haven't bothered with doing the events to get the eggs going.
---
You manage to lose a slot as the commander?
---
this will be a toxic and salty chat and will either 
---
* end up in less player communication for the ones who do not speak english or refuse to (french, spanish and german players tend to do that)
---
* will remove players from the game 
---
or will do both.

Incredible!! I’m curious about what the character looks like ig
---
That's one big ass fucking tree.
---
Iirc, the max level i gained was about 100 ~ 110 levels in 14 hours back in the day when i was grinding the skirmish tickets. That’s with the bday booster, and candy corn xp. There’s a wxp enrichment and wxp guild boost but i never use those though - i prefer the wvw reward track boost version.
---
It all depends on your squad though and if you’re steamrolling or on the reverse end.
---
Tools exist in the game(and outside of it) to solve your problems. You ignoring or dismissing them does not make them less of a valid solution(s) to your issues.
---
So the slow release of raids is an "us* problem?
---
Didn't now players were in charge of raid development.
---
TIL
---
:^)
---
Not exactly what you're looking for, but try toggling Light Adaption under Graphics Option in Settings.
---
Don't be naive, if it's not glowing so hard my eyes catch fire I'm not interested.
---
And as the president, his businessman hands are tied. He can say whatever he wants, but Congress doesn't have to listen to any of it.
---
Congrats! :)
---
Charr charr charr
---
Sorry I wasn't intelligent and clever enough to understand it.
---
I can see how Congress tie his hands with China. And the whole story about China is about money
---
I thought most people will place the wall of reflection skill right on top of the boss and then it will reflect in all directions (but I may be wrong because I'm not exactly a pro).
---
You don't need one
---
&gt;You must play to unlock it for free.
---
This wasn't a thing back when I played and it feels a little bit strange that I can't even see the end of the story of the chapter I purchased with money, because I didn't play within some time frame when I had other stuff to do IRL?
---
silverwastes is accessible without season 2's story unlocked and is one of the best gold farms in game (and 600 doesn't take as long to farm as you'd expect)
---
The expansions were not free though?
---
Do so. Druid was never good for PvE and with the recent nerfs gutted his solo DPS even more with pet nerfs. Do not use druid outside teams.
---
Damn, that'll be a pretty big investment then :/
---
start by playing Heart  of Thorns, by the time you complete all that content, you'll have more than enough gold to buy the first few chapters of Season 3.. then play that, and you'll generate enough gold to unlock the following chapters, etc..
---
you don't have to buy everything at once, you just unlocked a shit ton of content by buying both expansions, focus on that before worrying about what you dont have.
---
Really? I heard power mirage is crap. But will check it out, thanks
---
I thought this was gw1 farming at first. Right in the nostalgia.
---
You should essentially consider it three expansions. The amount of story content and maps from Living World are more than the equivalent of an expansion. My only issue is that they don’t offer a good way to bundle these with expansions. There should be a complete option that has both expansions with their respective LWS, along with individual complete bundles (i.e. HoT &amp; S3, PoF &amp; S5).
---
Oof
---
I tried my best to read everything and understand but I still don’t see the problem. At first I thought you were misusing the word transparency.
---
I think the devs preferred to make the empty slots transparent so that players don’t have a massive blind spot on their screen while in the field. UI artists for a game probably have to decide whether they want the menus to feel integrated with the world or separate. 
---
A fully opaque menu will feel like a sheet of paper sitting on top of your game. It is a bit disconnected. Also, it goes against the **transparent, watercolor art style present in all Guild Wars 2 assets**.
---
I can understand if you don’t like this stye but I don’t think it is something they intend to “fix” since it is a design choice, not error.
---
&gt;should I maybe just ask for a refund?
---
If you aren't happy with paying for content you should just refund and leave.
---
Woah, what rapier is that?
---
Thank you very much! Here some of the reference screenshots I got :)
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/orRkNor.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/orRkNor.jpg)
---
You may feel bummed out right now, but in my opinion, don't worry about the seasons yet. You got both expansions and have loads of content to dive into. I'd recommend you ignore the order of the story for now and start playing PoF, make your way through its story and all the other stuff, unlock your elite specializations, unlock the five mounts you can get there (forget about Skyscale for now, it isn't that awesome, the Griffon is way more fun to fly around with). Then you can do all this with HoT, get your gliding masteries up and so on. There's so much to do! Legendary Armor is locked behind raids if I'm not mistaken, which is considered the hardest content in the game, you can worry about that later.
---
And then afterwards, when you feel you're done with the expansions, think about buying and playing the newest LW seasons. You will have all new episodes that are released from now on unlocked automatically if you keep actively playing. You may also have some gold accumulated then and consider using that to unlock older episodes. As a rule of thumb, the newer the episode, the more interesting its rewards (Skyscale, Roller Beetle, armor sets etc.)
---
Yeah, but I bet that raidsellers have been reported many times and obviously their service is still in lfg
---
it doesn't
---
thx we work hard on our 7-man instant wipes before the fight even starts
---
Thank you! I'm truly happy to see people enjoying my work! \^\_\^
---
Not sure what you are trying to say. If you don't belive in the statistic then ok fine. But i am not going to argue if it is right or not. It is the numbers refered too and used as source when people talk about it. And it is very clear for anyone to read how they made those numbers and then if you belive or not, that is not my issue :)
---
Yeah, a solution similar to WoW's Worgen in that you'd, for example, transform into the spirit you had chosen upon entering combat, while keeping weapons as they are (otherwise, it would look awkward with ranged weapons). Not the most optimal solution asethetically, though.
---
Hmm I’ve played necro since day 1 but haven’t played in a while since I did HoT as a ranger. Do you know how necro is doing right now?
---
Testing in a development environment is veeerry different from deploying it to the public build though. QA can only do so much and stuff slips through all the time when 5-10 people are quality checking and hunting for bugs, compared to a gigantic playerbase in the public build.
---
Simply irrational to state that "they never test" when you clearly don't have knowledge of how their environment look or even the strategy and planning they had through this. I dont either, but I dont make assumptions about how they lack in their works.
---
I admit I had to Google it, I didn't know that character :P ! Maybe my commissioner was influenced by her, after all isn't GW2 fashion the best for inspirations and cosplays?
---
nope, selling a raid (or whatever) is selling a spot on a party/squad. Anet has stated there's no problem with that.
---
With that said, a selling/buying section somewhere would probably solve many problems, but my guess is that anet won't ever do it because it would look as if they favor this practice when they are neutral.
---
That's why they added filters like this to allow people to hide what they don't want to see.
---
No but the seasons are completely free if you log in during the time they are up as a nice jesture to the veterans of the game. Other wise you have to pay for it. 
---
But then again Arena Net have no vip/patron/special bags or what ever else that you pay for every month to get special treatment. They have their seasons and the expac and the gem store. They need to get the money somewere to keep on making content.
---
I could agree that they could make a bundle out of the seaons. Was one thing when there was season 2 and 3 but now there is 4 and 5 comming up so making it easier for people to buy should be something they should think about.
---
Season 1 is not replayable but since season 2 and ahead this was always a thing.
---

---
Seems necro is going to take it, how much longer should i keep it open for?
---
Gilded Hollow has an entire series of different environment-feels on it's upper layers and it's amazing to discover.
---
dishonor isn't character based
---
I'm not trying to flame, I promise, but if there is currently no content you'd like to play, what on Earth do you ever like to do in this game? The new story and map are only a month old (which include the new mount collection), there's a new raid wing, there's 2 events going on that heavily incentivize PoF metas AND and core game content... What are you looking for my guy?
---
Dont forget about people that have complained about destroyers being immune to burning. I too think its a bit silly that a fire elemental can take dmg from burning or a skeleton can bleed etc. Gw2 is a weird game sometimes.
---
Mythwright Gambit Quadim now goes by "Wha? No! QUADIM!"
---
Qadmeme. Because spending 9 months on "content" that takes 1 day to clear is the greatest meme ive ever seen.
---
sadly in NA lfg there is ONLY sellers most of the time lol
---
Each episode is stand alone. You can buy just the last episode, but you'll have access to just the last episode.
---
Don't worry about legendary gear just yet. It's the same stats as ascended. That's this games long term goal, there's nothing actually special about it (okay okay, it's always stat selectable, and you can swap runes and sigils in and out of them, but unless you are trying to make one set of gear for multiple characters, or use dramatically different builds constantly with one, those features won't be used that often). There's different legendary sets, so just cause you don't have season 4, doesn't mean you can't get any legendary gear.
---
The Skyscale requires access to all of season 4. You can start it with just the last episode, but won't be able to finish it. Again, it's nothing special. You'll use your other mounts way more than Skyscale. It's not fast, and there is a way to technically climb infinitely high with it, but it requires all it's masteries and another one from early in the season and is more of a glitch than anything.
---
Don't worry about these two things. Both of them can wait.
---
I did the story, but I am not bothered enough about the mount to leave the heart of the mists.
---
Wait a sec. Shouldn't be a new feature tested on separate build?
---
&gt;Simply irrational to state that "they never test" 
---
Erm.. Look at patch notes. They literally disabled confusion on one of the boss attack. Because too much damage. That including they never tested it. Test boss on every condition? It's could be automated test, they even changed confusion at some point so they DO know what this condition do. That what i mean by "they don't test". I do not ask them to test community popular build, because they don't listen to community. 
---
But....hey, many mmo project use help of hi-end guildies to test hi-end content before releasing it. And they give them something in return, like "something golden" if they did not told anyone about new content and helped them. But again. Anet don't do this.
---
ooohh mesmer closing in
---
I bet you're real fun to hang out with.  You seemingly have nothing to add to any conversation.
---
It's not dishonor for the case the OP is mentioning.  You can see dishonor if you've got it in the display.  
---
For this, you get the display up to enter the queue with everything "enabled", but hitting the button for it does nothing.
---
Next time it happens ask in map chat if anyone else is affected.  Normally those already in a queue are ok, just others can't join.
---
You have to be mentally ill to believe that "I'll leave you alone if you leave me alone" is oppressive in the same manner as "do this list of shit that I say or I will have the police kidnap and/or kill you."
---
I despite complete immunities, but I would have liked for more creatures to have different interactions with conditions and other effects.  
---
You'd have to change how to use the conditions and CC against them, and there would be ways around it.  
---
Something like this:
---
* Dredge: 
---
 * Immunity to Blindness only for melee attacks. 
---
 * All dredge with ranged weapons will have alternate melee weapons. Alternate melee weapons do less damage, but they will only switch to melee weapons to attack after they miss a ranged attack. If they hit you with their ranged weapons in melee range they won't switch. 
---
* Fire elementals: 
---
 * Burning deals half damage to them unless they also have Chilled.
---
 * Receiving a stack of Burning gives them a stack of might for the same duration if they are not chilled. 
---
* Lava elementals: 
---
 * If they hit you in melee range, they will transfer their burning stacks.

 * Chilled will have double effects on them and prevent burning transfer.
---
* Destroyers: 
---
 * They receive a skill that consumes all stacks of burning to heal themselves and gain regeneration. This skill will fail to convert burning if they are chilled. 
---
 * While chilled, destroyers can't recover health and gain vulnerability when hit.
---
* Ice elementals: 
---
 * Chilled heals them unless they are also burning.
---
 * While burning they can't heal.
---
* Earth elementals: 
---
 * Instead permanent stability (which became removable when they changed stability to stack, and never got fixed), they get a defiance bar. 
---
 * They take 90% less damage from direct damage until their defiance bar breaks. Conditions are not affected. 
---
* Risen Abominations.
---
 * Instead being immune to all ensnares and CC except launch, they get a locked breakbar. 
---
 * While their break bar is locked, they take 50% less damage. 
---
 * The locked breakbar unlocks for CC when they are doing charge attack and when they ready an Abomination Slam attack or Throw Club attack. 
---
 * Breaking the bar will stun them for 2s, remove their stacks of Frenzy and greatly reduce their armor.
---
* Treants
---
 * Instead being immune to all ensnares and CC except launch, they get an unlocked breakbar. 
---
 * While their defiance bar is blue, they take 50% less damage from direct attacks and conditions last 50% on them.
---
 * Breaking their defiance bar stuns them and remove their defenses.

I don't think having died saves you from dragon corruption. The reason it saved you from the scarab plague was that the beetles sensed that you were strange and didn't want you to be the host of their brood.
---
oooohhh mesmers taking the lead!
---
The government preventing something from being sold is the same as the government preventing that thing from being bought.
---
That's what I figured.

no booth, just business
---
Well, Mist Wardens in Dragonfall want a word. But I see you point
---
Excuse accepted. Flawless logic. :)
---
Sadly I agree with you, I used to play druid a lot in fractals buit healbrand has been a godsend as it at least offers some more flexibility and more engaging gameplay.
---
In pvp and wvw at least yes
---
Necro is great. Scourge is fun and reaper is awesome.
---
Anybody remember the torch from May's data-mine?
---
If you stick with guardian and want to try a healspec, I would suggest checking out Healbrand, it is fun in fractals and raids and it somewhat works (with some modifications) in openworld.
---
My eyeballs are melting.
---
&gt;  Then you don't have to grind the new maps and you already have most of the currency..
---
Again: no. That is not at all what happened. I've been working on other stuff. You're just suffering from confirmation bias because that's how you experience the game.
---
You can't craft it yet and it's hidden in the wardrobe, but the chatcode works.
---
Hehe, yeah. That was literally me being a pest. But for sake of consistancy, perhaps being a corporeal being is not protection from corruption, unless you already suffer from a conflicting corruption.
---
Sorry but core dps guard ist pretty outdated, DH is superior in every situation now again...
---
Exactly this.
---
If the bug was related to old content showing up, then that devourer champ would have def been from the BWE finale, as [there were branded champs](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defeat_the_invading_branded_champion), though from the few documents, only two types of champs were seen (charr and griffon).
---
As for bringing back Season 1, it would be nice if they were bringing back S1 content in both open world and story journal. There were overall hundreds of events that could be brought back, and plenty of achievements tied just to open world content that could be feasibly brought back, but the most effective ones to bring back would 100% be the Secret of Southsun Cove events with the settlers vs consortium situation (with the whole "maps stuck in time" I could see them bringing back all that content but the instance and "dungeon" tbh). But given responses from devs, I highly doubt that there's any of them working on it between releases.
---
I respect their opinion and upvoted the well-made demonstration and explanation of the difference.
---
I disagree with them that the lower shaders look better. It sucks it's hard to control the colors, but I really do think the iridescence is a cool layer on the skin.
---
It's a recurrent issue, no idea on how and why it happens and judging from the forum topic it has been there for quite a while. It goes away after a while though.
---
Now we have to fix the mess we have done.
---
We got a temporary respite, but now Aurene has the magic of 3 dragons and a god. She can't hold all of that on her own forever.
---
* Step 1: Find other 5 friendly entities capable of sharing the burden of magic and keeping a gentle magic flow like Aurene, or teach or transform existing ones so they are capable of doing the same. Here are some possible candidates known so far: 
---
 * The Pale Tree or a newly grown world tree. 
---
 * A Celestial entity from Cantha.
---
 * Any surviving dragons that were not corrupted, like the elder Saltspray dragon Kuunavang from Cantha or Shiny, the (250 years ago) baby saltspray dragon that used to live in The Hidden City of Ahdashim. 
---
 * A Kirin from Cantha. Ancient scaled horse-like draconic spirits of nature. 
---
* Step 2: Replace the two remaining dragons that died with the new entities, letting them share the burden with Aurene.
---
* Step 3: Plan ways to deal with the remaining 3 dragons and replace them too. Preferably voluntarily, but if their torment won't let them reason, then kill them.
---
* Step 4: Check on the aftermath of the Gods leaving, and get replacements for them too if needed, if the people they left behind in charge like Desmina and The Judge are not enough or show any signs of corruption or greed for power.
---
Or she.
---
Exactly those people. If you can be bothered to clear the raid yourself, you'll likely never buy frim the sellers. But there are quite a few people that have the gold but just don't want to do the raids amd only get some exclusive reward/achievement with the least amount of hassle.
---
Same devs that said there won't be expansions, mounts and of course no elder dragon fighting in Living World.
---
Soon TM
---
why
---
If I buy only the latest living world episode as a new player without any expansions or LW unlocked will i still get the new LW episodes that release for free when they launch?
---
I really need to get this mount and skin.
---
The descriptions under enemies are fixed to the creature template and do not work well to explain things, so it would be better if this kind of effect was shown with effect icons like the ones Awakened have.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Twisted_Earth
---
Twisted earth clearly shows that awakened get boons if you attack them from a distance, and it gets replaced with a purple version while it's recharging.  It's very easy to notice what's going on.  
---
* Destroyers could have an "Inner Fire" effect. And it would be Blue like the blue version of Twisted earth. Hover the mouse over the effect, and it explains that if you put burning on them, they will use it to heal themselves. 
---
 * Put chilled on them, and the icon changes to the purple version while Inner Fire is disabled, and the purple version explains their downside when they get chilled.
---
&gt;  My experience has been the exact opposite of yours. Now what?
---
There is no "now what?". I never said that arcdps is always bad or can't be good. Ofcourse it has two sides. 
---
All I originally said was "another group destroyed by arcdps". And there *are* groups getting destroyed, people getting kicked or leaving because or arcdps. It's a fact no matter how much excuses you bring of how situation XY could be there even without arcdps or how you personally use it. 
---
There *are* people getting kicked which wouldn't be the case without arcdps. You can't deny that.
---
They were probably trying to find data horny companies to deal with under the pretense of advertising :/
---
Yes, but their unblockable doesnt last as long as my auras, and as a support tempest I have 3k toughness, protection and frost aura going at their first burst (due to traits when they first crit you), plus being on earth gives even more dmg reduction.
---
At most they can take 30-50% hp if they set their burst right, which then I will easily heal while they kill themselves on reflection.
---
Seaweed shuffle is my signature dance move.
---
Thank you for the correction :)
---
If it wasn't walled off before it'll done soon now..

Heres an Taco pack by Deroir ( inclouding mesmer skips) -  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9yhwh2/introducing\_the\_taco\_tryhard\_marker\_pack\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9yhwh2/introducing_the_taco_tryhard_marker_pack_for/)
---
That's the thing, he had maxed mastery points and over 20k AP so by all means he wasn't a newbie. Not to mention doing above average dps once he switched to a proper dps class. 
---
I still believe he played support on purpose. I called him out near the end of the second fractal. That's more than enough time for realising a mistake.
---
GW3? Yeah right.
---
Yes.
---
They never said any of this.
---
Now if you're really evil you spam those at auric basin chests and at the end of td meta and you'll get a bunch of angry people.
---
Farming candy corns? Can only do during Halloween of course, or the home node - or someone else's home node.
---
Just takes time, but would be cheaper.
---
&gt; where Doern Velazquez comes from
---
Thank you for reminding me this mystery exists and hasn't been solved yet.
---
Also, while Utopia was never released and therefore isn't canon, there's still theoretically a ton of material they could draw ideas from. With the datamined Mist Stranger outfit, it makes me wonder if we'll be looking into the Mists, the gods, etc sooner than later. And Utopia was all about that.
---
I’m with you on that point, I think it all depends on how the next expansion performance will be. But yeah, there won’t be GW3 for a whiiiiiiile.
---
Just melee it, all it's attacks are easy to step out of, only thing to watch out for is not to stand behind him when he uses his push back wind attack, else you likely end up in fire, which is hot.
---
Whenever a living world episode is released, if you log in during the time its active (i.e. before they release the next episode) you'll get it for free, even as a F2P player iirc. This applies even if you own or bought the previous living world episodes.

Ah, that's quality ~~shitposting~~ coleslaw distribution.

Its almost as if it is legal and reporting something legal won't and shouldn't get them banned

Could've used position rewinder...
