I sorta wasn't trying to do myself favours or argue anything. I was just hoping that if a trans person saw that comment, they'd also see someone opposed to it. And sometimes sarcasm is better than a fight, because it doesn't weigh you down as much and it's a bit agnostic to the larger arguments that are going on. You can just say, 'lame joke', and move on, without fighting every battle.

There are still meany elders out there.

In 1 A.D. it was still called Saturnalia. :p

Well I dont actually have DH unlocked yet, and my experience with core guard is fights tend to go south quick (mostly due to bad habbits gained from playing necro for years). My core guard is currently in rare zerk gear and slowly unlocking DH. Honestly, I'm just looking for somone to use this gear on so I can get rid of the boxes in my bank.
---
Whoa a festival that isn't in DR/LA? Sweet! About time Norn got something interesting. It's good to have more events like this.

[from the design, reminds me a bit of jack of blades from fable. maybe because he had some weird effects in the endfight, dunno.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/8/81/Jack_of_blades.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120706104703)

You can change gear whenever you want for free under “equipment”. The wardrobe tab only lets you change the appearance of your gear, while keeping the old stats. If you want to change the appearance of a piece of gear, yes, it costs 1 transmutation charge per transmute, but changing your actual gear is free in the equipment tab.
---
Ah, I knew it reminded me of something but couldn't place it!
---
Agreed..

Cauliflower patch, Rich Plat, Lots of saplings for lumberer, Vista by climbing the asuran building.

All at the same waypoint.

So the new one is a direct nod to this one. Interesting. That makes me appreciate it some more. Thanks for sharing!
---
Take an upvotegram, probably has a downvote in it though.
---
Human is widely regarded as the fastest, though there's some debate as to whether commoner or noble is the fastest line. Commoner used to be the "meta" choice because it could easily be completed with a character under level 10, but with the changes to key farming that's no longer necessary and no one's really done an in-depth review on story choices.
---
Class is largely irrelevant if you're doing the story at level 10, but in general you want something with shadowsteps and/or swiftness available so you can move faster through the mount-less story instances. Just use a power build, and if you're really serious about it you'll want a full set of blue gear that you can transfer to the next character (blue gear doesn't become soulbound on use).
---
Tbh I didn't notice that knife until you've mentioned it. Now it's gone from a kinda outter space looking outfit to a commando one.

But won't it hide the hood too? That's the awesome part, I LOVE the hood but without the mask.

Okay but why isn’t anybody talking about the drift icon is FAST AND FURIOUSSSSSS DRIFT DRIFT DRIFT

It actually displays lower quality than max settings.
---
Sadly yes. It hides the hood as well.
---
It makes me hopeful for a spring festival in The Grove.
---
They are probably still in the same category.
---
I got it from unlocking the boots with wvw reward track. This was about 1 week ago.
---
I'm not the driver, just a member. I was particularly pleased with the second fight. Green was quite a bit larger than us, but by the time they noticed their tail was getting picked, the fight was all but over.
---
Sure, that's understandable, but what if someone else enjoys seeing their numbers? An option to freely choose for one self is all I'm suggesting, not a general change for everyone that can't be changed back.
---
PvP my friend.  
---
Also works with normal matches.  
---
The prices on those charges in the gemstore is an absolute rip-off.
---
Thank you LVAJ, wHo, and the pugs that joined them for the fights! We had a great time! Anyone from LVAJ and wHo? If so, what was your take on the fights?
---
Proof that ANet is more reasonable with pricing XD
---
Looks like gifts from the wintersday npc from whom you can get once per day durings wintersday or ultimate gifts from wintersday reward tracks which were not in game six years ago. So he was more likely away for four-ish years and heavily invested time into the game before his break.
---
Or getting friends :D

The teal branded mist isn't supposed to be a "lucrative farming method" , or worth more than few gold. It replaced the occasional junk items that really were junk , that just sold for a few gold . Like 1 or 2 gold. This is a replacement , that is more interactive and interesting , and that if you use it correctly gives 4 or 5 gold instead of 1 or 2. It wasn't intended to be super awesome in the first place.
---
Excellent, thank you.
---
Oh holy fucking shit YES!!!
---
I wasn't around for the first one and I've always wondered about this festival!
---
Pretty it's sarcasm as thief is regularly nerfed for "too much damage"
---
And you know what? Just to make it fair to vegans, we can host Vegetable fest in the grove! Everybody wins!
---
Wait...
---
You can hide dmg numbers/combo field messages etc with ArcDPS
---
Holy crap this is amazing, I will practice this and try it out. Usually takes me 30 min so 20 min shaved off is quite a lot of time saved
---
Man seeing Dragon Ball really brings me back. Im not a PvP guy, but this was my favorite activity in the game, one that made me hope a-net would make more like it going forward. Can't believe it's been like 6 years.
---
I hope we get to see it again, but it looks like it has been replaced by the dragon arena, which is PvE.
---
Unless it’s anet devs spoiling future story how would you know it’s relevant?
---
in pvp looking for a ranged burst build
---
I had one before but I think they nerfed Air elementalist...
---
And if all the ranged burst builds are nerfed to the ground what is the best melee burst build then?
---
I think they could please  both the people that want more GW1 nostalgia and people that want a break from a human-centered story if they went north. They could revisit the Far Shiverpeaks and the Northern Charr Homelands (which were both some of the most beautiful environments in GW1). That would help flesh out the Norn, the Charr (and the Kodan!). The Norn, especially, have been underdeveloped. I would love more tidbits on their origin in the game. The Asura have been too, imo, but since most of Asuran history has been underground I can really only see Asura lore developed through some underground raid in the Depths of Tyria or something. On the bright side though,  I guess if we went to Cantha via the Dredge tunnels (to avoid Bubbles) we could flesh out both the Asura and Dredge and maybe Skritt? And if we went to Cantha I would hope we would get some Tengu action. Unless, Anet pulls what they did with the Centaurs and Elona. . .

He is abaolutely full of shit and cannot back it up. Even if he is counting the double damage from behind mechanic as part of the multiplier, it still doesn't hit 100x. Especially with two specializations.
---
Being wrong doesn't make him stupid, but vehemently defending his wrong stance when basic math infalliably proves him wrong...does indeed.
---
Currently according to SnowCrows:  Power Daredevil on anything, 35,018, Power Guard on HUGE hitbox 33533, Power Sword Weaver, 35340, Power Reaper, 31193, Condi Scourge, 28557.  It is definitely NOT quite a bit lower than guard necro &amp; ele.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
In fact, the reason it isn't THE meta class is because it has a much LOWER initial burst than any of those three, and so for true speed runs is less useful as it has to ramp its DPS up after 50%, rather than the other classes which start with absurdly high damage (in the 80-100k range) and their sustain goes down over time.  With speed runs and phased fights that burst is more important, and where the other classes are superior.  Your original point that thieves offer burst?  It's actually the exact opposite.  They don't have enough.
---
Lots of classes bring CC, thief sacrifices very little for its CC and its CC outperforms ALMOST every other single CC ability since the nerf to Moa (Basi Venom amounts to 750 total defiance bar damage, Moa now does 600, the only skill currently higher than Basi is, potentially, surge of the mists on rev, but only if you land it well.)  
---
DD specifically is meta for a few bosses because of its stolen skills, which are unique and extremely helpful on specific bosses.  I can say I have never been booted from a fractal or a raid for playing DD, you just have to be even marginally competent at it... which is the trick.  Most people have no idea how to actually play thief.
---
Which is basically aurora

Considering it's beat for beat an update of 2013's dragon bash trailer with updated features, I'd say it was well done both times.

Looks like someone took their least favorite armor aesthetic (ironclad) and tried to combine it with their most favorite aesthetic (Grenth's)...

My first time commanding anything LONG was south lane in DS (I had “tagged” Rata Novus lane in TD before this, but it was as a fill in cause the tag had to afk &amp; HoT was still new at the time so most people didn’t know what to do)! It was pretty nerve-wracking, but I mentioned it was my first time tagging DS at the start &amp; a ton of people in my squad were super vocal with their support the whole time &amp; helped me throughout.
---
Because of those people, I got really into commanding for HoT metas and found that I REALLY loved it! I haven’t tagged much anything recently cause of IRL stuff, but it’s still one of my favorite things to do.
---
I’m sure that the two-dye channels dedicated to post processing effects will lead us into a glorious new age of visual cancer at the Mistlock Sanctuary.

---
it's not that hard   
---
first of all you need all the living world s4 episodes and 250 of each map currency   
---
you can farm these currencies in like 2 day by repeating hearts, metas and events in your 5 chras   
---
you also need food and grow lamp which requires 22 charged quartz that you can get 1 per day so its you choice to farm those or buy your way through it and get it from the tp (80g or so)
---
the rest of the collection is just running around pressing F

Popping in to say that FFXIV spells are not animation locked, and are not the same thing as animation lock at all.
---
If you want to cancel a spell cast, you’re more than free to do so at any time. You are not locked in place. There are very few abilities in XIV that animation locked, and they’re all being adjusted in approximately a week.
---
I got something like 2 million over the course of the event
---
It just takes a long time and about 40 gold. It's definitely more difficult than the other commenter is making it out to be. Just use a guide and you can have it done within a week or less, depending on what materials you already have .
---
well i have a whopping 36g right now so TP not an option...
---
I'm a returning player that probably hasn't played the game in 5 years. I leveled up a mesmer and thief up to 80 and played a ton of pvp back when the game first came out. Was thinking of getting back into it gw2 and buying the expansions to get back into pvp but to also probably go through the stories in my other time. I've been messing around in pvp currently (just without the expansions) and it is coming back to me, but there are so many new currencies, items, and other things I have no idea what they do that I get in my inventory through rewards or boxes. Wondering if I can basically just start as an 80, and go through the two expansion stories, will that suffice for all the new stuff that I need to know? Or if I should just re-level a new character. I don't necessarily want to grind out a brand new character, but wondering if that is truly the best way to figure out all the new stuff added or if just starting the new expansions is a better route. Thanks for the help!
---
i have pretty much nothing and only 36 gold...  
---
guess i'll watch a video and figure out what i need...  
---
Thanks for the info
---
It's possible to get it, you just need to invest some time into actually getting it :)
---
I've only been playing for three months and got in within about a week and a half (Timegates were still in place). 
---
Two things you'll likely be missing:
---
- Charged Quarz Crystal 
---
— You'll need 12 or 22 of these - or farm a lot of gold (well, it‘s a lot for new players). The twelve are needed for the regular skyscale food; the other ten for a growth lamp (for which you‘ll need the Jeweler profession at 400)
---
- Map currency
---
— You'll need a stack (250) of each living world map currency. For me that was the biggest grind. Start doing the hearts each day early. If you have multiple lvl 80 characters, go take them on a lap around the maps each day too. (I'd suggest starting the gryphon collection, so you get the item that can transport you to the  sun‘s refuge. Saves you some story replays/map teleport scrolls.)
---
Good luck and have fun! :D The collections are great (apart from the first one which is a bit repetitive)
---
well your only option is to farm normal quartz or buy it because it's pretty cheap   
---
then charge one every day until you get 22 of them  
---
you will only spend like 8g on trash items
---
Sweet home Alabama
---
Makes it even better.
---
i haven't even ***been*** to those places yet, lol. ok, thanks that is helpful :-)
---
Weell; then I suggest you get on playing through all of the story first! ;)
---
yeah, i finished personal story and I'm on chapter 11 of HoT right now...i did the first bit of PoF to unlock raptor, but no further progress there...
---
good thing i plan on playing this game for a very long time, cause it looks like it's gonna be a bit before i get to the newest stuff.  
---
thanks for the info, i appreciate it :-)
---
idk why but i can’t wait to get into pvp. nothing can feel better than being shit on by some rando asshat then showing him his place. it’s just banter, you shouldn’t take things to heart. They’re bot angry at you as an individual. They’re angry at your momentary gameplay and that can mean whatever. Either you doing things ‘wrong’, using ‘that’ class, weather you suck or you’re too good. You’ll always get shit on because ppl are like that. Looking down on others, while i really really wish it wasn’t the case because i know how shitty it feels especially when it happens irl, but that kind of behaviour for some reason boosts peoples self esteem. You shouldn’t consider them bad people, just people with issues and we have them. Back to irl...nobody is going to say ‘thank you’ for taking someones nightshift or working extra hard when you really don’t have to. People will use any opportunity to look down on you though. All you can do is to be above it, say fuck it, and go for the back piece anyway.
---
250 of each Living World Season 4 (LW4) map currency, to be more precise.
---
Check [this link](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lump_of_Mistonium) at the end, you'll find the 6 currencies involved.
---
Which means you need all the six episodes (and having played at least the 4th one, to unlock the Sunspear Sanctuary).
---
Yeah it takes a while, bit the ride is a fun one.
---
You‘re welcome!
---
Just put your status on offline and turn off chat,  maybe put on a stream or TV show and breeze through it, win or lose, you'll get the loot anyway :D
---
holy shit i forgot that's where they're from lol but i still have mine, lol. hell. i still have tequatl's sitting around and the other holographic wing set.
---
There is some weirdness with conditions doing break bar damage. Forgot if it was cripple or blind but on a thief only the conditions applies from some skills actually did cc damage.
---
they were the original prize for completing all dragon bash cheevios, lol. i had to look it up as it's been so many years i forgot.
---
the magician armor, especially the skirt would fit pretty well for Black Cat Dva :D
---
it took effing forever too, lol, but at least i can fly a griffon like a boss now. (it's probably silly to be pleased that i did this but hey, it got me my corsair jerkin too ~)
---
It's API they provide 👍
---
dude i cant play 24/7, after work if i have no meetings or not, i sit and play, but i do different contents and sometimes karma isnt involved that much.plus i havent been playing hardcore for all those years , i took breaks in between.
---
We can't tag ourselves as a target so I think that he is pointing to another player.
---
Oh yes. I always thought it was odd.
---
If you only have an hour or so to play, daily T4s are a good way to get gold. Most days I can pug them and walk away with 15-30g for my effort. Bonus is they are fun to do! Also you can get ascended gear and infusions for your next character / build.
---
Always have something you're working on would be my advice. I just finished my second legendary, Ad Infinitum, and now I'm working on finishing Rodgort and Chuka. That some days means grinding Dragonfall for materials, or T4s for gold, or doing random dungeons or gathering for more rare materials. There's a lot of content out there, so I find I'm happiest when I change it up. Missing a daily isn't the end of the world, otherwise the game becomes a chore.
---
Yet this kind if damage stacking is the only way Ranger can compete with other classes for DPS in raids and fractals.
---
If they nerf this without splitting the skills between PvP and PvE, Power Soulbeast will instantly disappear from the PvE landscape altogether.
---
it's not hard, a bit tedious at times but that's it. you do need all the  maps of season 4 unlocked tho
---
Tbh, I would not recommend starting a new character. The core game is great, but it’s most important in knowing the the play style/role of your class. Since a lot of endgame even relies on elite specs, there’s nothing new for you to learn. Most end game currencies aren’t even mentioned in the core game. All the new stuff added you will learn by playing the expansions. IMO learning about your class comes once you’re fully leveled and can customize new stuff. You aren’t taught what most things are in your inventory, mostly just use Gw2 wiki. Again if you’re a new player, play the core game, but if you’re used to a class and know the basics, (sigils,runes,stats,skills, how to play your class, etc) then leveling up 80 is saving time. Have fun the expansions are great imo.
---
I would do legendary, but for how much fully ascended costed me I'd hate to imagine the price. Maybe someday. My secondary is a deadeye. He's full crit build, mostly just for fun. I don't think he'd last a second in fracs lol
---
Just happened to me tonight , I played a match , then when it was over suddenly I could not que anymore for ranked or unranked. logged out , closed and reopen game , tried to que from outside pvp lobby as well.
---
Looking at the pictures linked in your user flair, you seem to really like asurans. Haha.
---
Never left. WvW and re-exploring maps. AB, dragon fall, world bosses.
---
I'm not condone such behaviour but you need to understand why they do this.
---
PvP is a team based games which means that your team is either punished or rewarded depending on if you lose or win! But it is rarely the case that one player can "carry" their whole time but more often the case that one player can screw the whole match for everyone else.
---
Every player has a goal that they play for! In your case it is to get The Ascension but others might want to play for the competitiveness. They play for the win and now someone comes in, doesn't know anything about how to play this and drags everyone down in the process. How would you feel if the roles would be reversed?
---
From their perspective, whenever they lose they wasted their time in the game and the blame goes to the ones that, again from their perspective, were responsible for this.
---
And of course they weren't whining when you won the match because, well, you won the match, they reached their goal.
---
Additional to this, the state PvP is in right now is not really helping the situation. Population is lower because of the many issues that have not been addressed for far too long and players just moving away from PvP because they already reached everything they wanted to do or just grew tired of this. In my own experience, I quit PvP a while ago because just 15 minutes of match were so damn frustrating that even the rewards didn't compensated it. Which means, players are fighting against or with the same players over and over, bots are more present and the matchmaking can't balance teams because there are not enough players in the pool to choose from.
---
People get frustrated because of this and unload their frustration on the next person that does something that doesn't sit well with them.
---
However, as I said initially, why they behave like this is no excuse or justification on throwing racial slurs or insult in general someone. And my best advice for you is to report and block them and move on.
---
You shouldn't have to fear getting any punishment just because you are still new and bad in PvP but you will report them and they will get punished for behaving like they did.
---
So when I stopped playing long ago is when the first raid came out, and it was probably the hardest thing I think I've ever done. I don't think we ever even got past the first part. It was a bit of a turn off, hopefully they made some that are actually doable now.
---
How should I get started and learn about WvW? Is there like a better time of day to play?
---
there is not really something you can do, people get really defensive if someone else screws up their goal.
---
However, that shouldn't prevent you trying PvP though you need to prepare for it and I don't mean getting used to insults.
---
Getting a build from any website is okay but PvP relies on more than having a build but rather knowing how to play it, the game, your profession and how conquest is played in general. Going blindly into it will not help the situation at all.
---
And finally, there is always someone who complain or start insulting people. I had more than a few people who went AFK after the first fight and yet the game was really damn close in the end.
---
If someone insults you, report and block them and then move on.
---
Because PvP IS toxic?!
---
Why do you think GW2 has such a wondelfull community? 'Cause there is a strickt border between PvP and PvE
---
Maybe PvE OW Axe/Sh GS Guardian for LoLs?
---
It depends on your server. I just go on and look for things to do in WvW. My server is always fairly populated. Go in and ask questions. There are fine points that need to be learned like how long siege lasts and what swords on buildings mean. Have fun.
---
Pretty different collection mate.

Damage mods.  Berserker's gear, runes with a decent damage mod and power+ferocity or power+precision or precision+ferocity, traits (Marksman and beastmastery biggest offenders), merged with a ferocious pet, sic 'em command, and using greatsword maul for attack of opportunity, and landing a lucky crit on your face.  Yeah, it sucks.
---
Check raid or even wvw builds on snowcrows/metabattle.
---
Raid wings can vary in difficulty. They never directly nerfed the previous wing though, so the first wing is still as hard as you can remember, mechanically. However, players who have been raiding got accommodated to the fights so it can be easier to do old wings.
---
Anet also has a tendency to buff rather than nerf during balance patches, plus new specializations kinda power crept the PvE balance, which made the whole thing easier. 
---
That being said, raids are still supposed to be challenging content, and players can't expect to clear everything the first time they ever try the game mode. If you're getting turned off the first time you try because you can't clear the first boss, maybe the game mode isn't for you. It's all about retrying to be better and carrying your own weight during fights. I'd suggest you to look at meta builds, learn a rotation and then you'll have an easier time in there!
---
It came with the caladbolg bundle. We only got the OG caladbolg as a skin, and the fancy caladbolg apparently doesn't keep the cool skills.
---
If you're talking about the first boss/wing, I'd rather say no, others are overall not easier. It's up to players to step their game up, train their skills and refine their builds.
---
Depends on the class but it's not worth it in raids because you can take aggro from tanks.
---
It can range from 10-20% I'd say.
---
Soulbeast is still the master of ranged bursts. Check metabattle, it probably has builds.
---
Ele is really not worth playing in pvp, especially as a glass cannon.
---
Agreed. It had character and soul. The ocean themepark we have now is just so cold. Parts of it are lovely and I actually like, but not the parts anyone actually uses. I hate the jellyfish pavilion with a passion.

As long as you do not want to have the mount immediately, but can log in for one (1) minute each day, you can buy 5 of each needed currency in dragonstand per day. That means after about 2 months you have all necessary materials even if you managed to start with 0, which is unlikely.
---
And really, that kind of language is not necessary. It is fine to be angry, just don't send the texts you write in that state.
---
It's funny because for a good dd core thief player sb5 is your engagement skill but anet already nerfed it by giving all of the other classes a ton of movement utility. This means thieves can never land the sb5 blind (120 radius) required for them to also land their dagger 5 skill without being stunned or relying on chance. Keep in mind that this combo takes ALL of the thiefs initiative, so the few skilled players who actually do land this combo SHOULD be rewarded but anet gives thief dick in lieu of any favorable high-skill play.  
---
Sure if you land that blind you're a god at thief LIKE ME :D (I wish). But the fact is it's too much initiative lost just to land one backstab then eat a triple-chain stun from LITERALLY EVERY OTHER CLASS and die. What fun.

---
so you guys also have an EU pop on your discord?
---
nothing is wrong with them. i just wanted to point out that you can reduce the dmg output quite heavy on someone who invested all his gear and traits into damage instead of survivability which just a few conditions while someone who builds tanky doesn't need to care that much and can drag out the fight longer until those are gone.
---
Came back as a WoW refugee after 6 years of absence. Found that I had a ton of boosts so I leveled all classes to 80. Now doing the story.
---
After I'm done with LWS3, PoF, and LWS4 I'll start doing mount unlocks. Need my Beetle, Skyscale and Griffon.
---
After that I want 100% completion of all maps (Tyria, HoT and PoF).
---
When I'm done with that, I'll focus on masteries so they're all maxed out.

Throughout that process, I'll be gearing and getting all the ascended stuff from fractals.

After that I'll start going hardcore on farming gold so I can buy all the cosmetics from the gem shop.
---
By that time Classic will have definitely been released (for a while), so I'll check it out, and hopefully come back to GW2 when LWS5 is completed (I don't like cliffhangers).
---
It's a good game. Sandboxy and the combat is smooth. Dunno how I forgot about it for this long.
---
How good is your internet connection? During world bosses, with lots of players sending data about using their skills, it can be a lot more bandwidth intensive than when you're just running around in the open world.
---
I have the same problem when my download-capped internet slows down to a crawl, I can do instanced content and regular open world just fine, but world bosses beat down my connection. So without having any knowledge about your situation, my guess is that it could be your internet speed isn't enough.
---
&gt; I treat the trading post like unlimited storage 
---
they put taxes on sell orders so you cant do that, so i assume they put a limit on how many you can buy
---
*vomits*
---
I just like killing world bosses :D
---
if you find out how to get it let me know... I think it's a mistake from their end tbh.. no gambling involved here
---
7 years and counting here. Will be a sad day when someone actually buys them.
---
\*asura  
---
Not picking on you, it's just an error I see a lot. "Asuran" is something pertaining to the asura, like "asuran technology" or "asuran clothing". The race is just "asura".
---
DE is still great as roamer in WvW. 
---
Make sure you are still on an active server (for your own playtimes) and WvW is a fun time for sure!
---
Like PvP the WvW can be great if you have limited playtime you can just jump in and play instantly... get a few quick kill streak and logout to do irl stuffs.
---
Also WvW has easy ascended armors/weapons (they come from WvW skirmish tickets and are unlocked with “reward” tracks).. Can also get the prestigious 2k “tendrils” Armor set as LEGENDARY!! (I did the legendary PvP tendril set)
---
Sooo yeah you can also get easy/cheap ascended from WvW/PvP as well. (And tons of free obsidian shards, pvp/wvw potions, trans charges and tomes... stacks and stacks of all that junk)
---
Oh and Welcome back!
---
valeguardian never got nerfed and some people had the balls do to them trio and solo.  
---
its up to you to "git gud". you said your deadeye wouldn't last a second in t4 fractals because its full crit. what if i told you that the meta which many groups run doesn't have any healer included and the support and heal only comes off a few skills, rest needs to be dodged.  
---
everything gets played as full glass cannon since game release and everything always was possible with this gear.  
---
you can work for something in this game, which doesn't cost you any gold and feels super rewarding once you have it because everything gets easier and its more fun to play...player skill.  
---
just don't care about gold rewards, simply git gud. thats rewarding enough.
---
if you have autoloot and you are alive. there is a big chest when oyu finish the event with that stuff in it. so its not true what you said.
---
The second part to my question is, if there are limits, is is based on "stacks" of items in your inbox, or amount. I know that 100 on the same screen is the visual max, but what's the actual max :c
---
I like making money ;) &lt;3
---
ranger with multiple pets / swarm with hammer could be fun, they changed shout to commands recently so maybe they will add shout, more logical with multiple allies
---
Pros:
---
Cons:
---
\-Charr
---
\-Ember Infusion
---
\-Outfit
---
\-New LA
---
Ah. My main is a FB healer. I might be overwhelmed lol
---
It may mean to have more +9s to stick into different weapon sets. But 150 is max you need at the same time.
---
WvW and GvG community is very much alive, people who say otherwise are being dramatic. GvG tournament gets 300-400 viewers on Twitch, and 50-100 people watching in-game as bystanders.
---
It was so much more interactive and had so many levels and so much detail. From the nasty sewers you could fall into under the MF (which led to a sweet JP) to the top of those crows nest that was only placed there so you could rain bodies down on the afkers at the forge. God I miss it so much 😞
---
Started playing again about a month ago, here's what I suggest:
---
1. Catch up to the latest story if you haven't already
---
2. T4 fractals are VERY worth doing, you can get easy 10-20g a day, they not that hard at all, just make sure you have 1 good healer + 1 good chrono/alacragade + 3 full dps (if any of your dps is using toughness/vitality gear you are wasting your time, I know its very elitist but fights will last longer which is more time to make mistakes). And there is story in fractal 100 which is quite cool if you into that.
---
3. Raids are very worth doing, find a good raiding guild that do training sessions and you'll be raiding in no time, its not super easy but its not as hard as some people make it out to be.
---
4. Work toward a legendary, this can include legendary armor or backpiece or accessory or weapon, w/e.
---
5. Go to your collections at the bank, design a character that looks epic with what ever gear, then go and earn the skins you need.
---
Asura are my favorite, but the rest of the races are also fun. I just feel like asura and sylvari offer the most design space.
---
Humans are the only one i'll never bother with. There's so many *actually interesting* options.
---
Why release fucking outfit when ther can make more money relapsing every part ...
---
Fuck outfits arenanet
---
I have a Junkrat. I should share him sometime.
---
Even better
---
&gt; Is there a point where my black-lion delivery box would over-fill and items would stop buying/or get deleted?
---
I have never encountered a limit on items in your pick up tab, never heard of it either and I know plenty of power traders, who would have mentioned something like this.
---
&gt; I.e can I treat the trading post like unlimited storage if I am willing to not pick the items up?
---
Technically yes. But then you cant do any other trading on that account, of course. Its still relatively easy to pick up gold from sales, just have a character with a full inventory (remove empty bags) pick up the tab and only the gold will transfer.
---
I am assuming you want to buy the gossamer scraps for festival of the 4 winds.
---
If you plan to buy zephyrite supply boxes yourself with that gossamer, its a good and cheap method to buy gossamer now when its cheap. But if you plan to resell the gossamer during the price spike, be warned that you are extremely limited in the amount of gossamer you can sell per minute. You can sell an item (or stack) roughly every 10 seconds without getting the error message of selling too much items too fast, so this means 6 stacks per minute and 360 stacks per hour.
---
So that would mean it would take around 11 hours to sell 1 million gossamer scraps, 1 stack every 10 seconds.
---
Nothing silly about that. Completing all those Griffon Courses through the game turned me from an epileptic to an acceptable griffoneur. That's the GW2 magic. Insteand of grinding your numbers you become an actually better player.
---
Insofar: congratulations!
---
I can assure you, you're the minority on this but you can have an opinion 👍
---
Its only vaguely mentioned in some other answers so I thought to add my own:
---
Achievements.
---
I always have some achievement goals set that I think are reachable. Preferably the "do once" achievements like story or expantion maps. And I try to complete entire achievement sections if possible.
---
They also serve as pointers to show you content you otherwise would miss, as well as lots of details and side-story telling
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
If at least they let us to unlock the headgear, since you can toggle on off, people would buy more outfits...
---
I think what happened is that OLA was an organic city, it looked like it started small and slowly grew bigger over time. And NLA was sprung up in an instant.
---
It's basically the diffirence in \[name your preffered city building sim\] where one city has infinite funds and the other has been organically growing for decades if not centuries.
---
I’ve been hearing that the API has been invariably broken lately, so it may be that. 
---
The gw2crafts site itself has been pretty reliable in my experience.
---
I killed it like 10 times tops for the achiev and got 2 chests out of it, seems like you haven't made the right offers to the RNG God.
---
What does GOT mean?
---
Not hard... Just not possible.
---
Seasons are max 56days (always they are 8wks total)
---
The quest is 60 days... (15x4) so this and the PvP tickets required (125 at 100 per season max) are the true time gates for the PvP wings.
---
So it can be done no faster then 1 full season, 1 off season, + 4 days from the 2nd season.
---
You are entitled to have your opinion :)
---
everyone started out on the bottom and we all where overwhelmed at some point.  
---
i mean slacking arround is what many players do, just playing for fun not caring about anything and playing "subpar" builds.  
---
in the end its up to you how you want to play the game. first thing you might want to do is finding likeminded people, then its easier to start out.  
---
if you play with more dedicated players, you might wipe a lot but beat stuff at some point and maybe at some point you will grasp mechanics fast because you have enough knowledge.   
---
if you play with a more casual and safe crowd, you will probably find success faster, but some stuff will probably stay closed to you since you won't ever make it through and since playing safe also can introduce some kind of slack maybe you will not get better at all.  
---
maybe you get better tho, because its a safer enviroment where you can learn at you pace and the whole group evolves at some point. you never know.  
---
the best is to never mix stuff up, this just introduces toxicity where players expect too much and other which will never meet those expectations. a clear standpoint is always better.  
---
also just because you play hardcore for example doesn't mean you can't take a chill pill and just do whatever. people playing better and more towards meta are also those which can do whatever and still succeed in something, because more experience.  
---
but this experience doesn't come from nothing. so playing the game is top priority, only knowing mechanics doesn't bring you far if you never can play them.  
---
so a few daily dungeons and fractals till you are in T4, maybe gearing some char (and may it be only exotic) to fill in for some easy bosses (wing 4 boss 1 - 3 for example) without doing the hard ones first can already bring you farther.  
---
i mean, even if you want to "git gud" you can take a chill pill if its not your thing to tryhard from the go for hours till you succeed.
---
does the used api key have the right permissions?
---
You can check those on your gw2 account.
---
It's like Nausicaa meets ME Quarians, and threw in some Destiny.
---
We've only had one before and it was so long ago that they've probably changed a lot of it. We're all going into it with fresh eyes. You can take a look at the wiki page for the original event: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragon_Bash_2013 and I expect some of it will be adapted from that.
---
Not gonna lie, I was going thief over DD. DD is stuck in the whole "need to dodge to keep dps" ....for wholesome 4 seconds, yay, I hate it. Dodge to keep dps is the most idiotic idea ever. Healing venom is indeed strong, and I was using stealth, so you are not wrong. But I don't recall having much condi removal outside DD, except from trickster.
---
yeah, the build with 1 million dodges you have to use blindly to keep a terrible to average dps, and have none when you really need to use one.
---
If there's really a max nobody has probably reached that amount.
---
But if there was going to be any kind of limit it would have to be implemented as a limit on buy orders because this limit cannot eat your gold upon reaching the capacity. What i mean is, lets say that there was a limit of 1000K items (stacks) that you can have on your delivery box (only 100 visible). If that was true there should also be a limit on buy orders because those buy orders could convert themselves into items into your delivery box. And to make things more complicated, you can place a single buy order of a stack of 250 items and have them delivered indivually in 250 single items as a worst case scenario. That makes me believe that there's no cap in the delivery box. If there was going to be any kind of limit it would be on the number of buy orders or sell orders. But if there was such a limit it would probably be very high. Placing sell/buy orders manually would be very tedious to do, and automating it has a lot of chances to be a violation of the TOS.
---
The ones that I’ve given a background/general idea to sort of just... fall into place. Either from playing the game or looking at character options. A lot of it comes from playing with my friend and making a set up for our characters to make them feel different, so we have our ‘canon’ story for most of our characters. 
---
My recent one was a gnarly grandma Charr whose become branded after the release of the branded weapons. 
---
But I’ve done twins after planning to redesign a character to change their class, liking them them both together, so making them twins with tweaks to the original. They have a theme of one being blind and the other mute.
---
One of my asura is a close friend of my house mates commander - so he’s not doing the commander plot line stuff. My original main is now a healing ranger, so he’s becoming a monk in design. My main character fits into the idea of my friends salad being the commander, but he’s specifically the champion for aurene. 
---
It’s just finding the right spark or item to delve into an idea for me.
---
API seems to be fine atm. (https://status.gw2efficiency.com/)
---
Invisible bags can already act like a sort of lock item, right?
---
Thats pure bullshit. Ive bought hundrets upon hundrets of stacks of items, they just dont display in top 100 pickup box.
---
The new skyscale mount got me back in from when I went on hiatus a month ago. I've been doing dailies, fractals, and trying to get into raids.
---
Sites with builds still cant load anything.
---
It can be but you rarely see a block or reflect pop up for one hit ( not counting aegis )
---
You can as easily order 250 eternities for 100g each, if you are so worried about gold limit, cuz at some point your CES orrder will fil. Also using Tp as unlimited storage is quite valuable tactic on alt acounts, where you buy stuff and let it sit there untill you need it.
---
It also captures how the first few collections need you to do the same thing 3 times (go around the map for scales, go around the map again for sick skyscales, go around again for eggs).
---
I have around 6 million items in my delivery box on another account. If there is a limit, nobody's reached it yet. I know a few people who do buyouts on things on alt accounts and have multiple millions of items in there with no problem.
---
Ofc it can, but it wont.
---
Nah I like it haha
---
I never block anything like that in case for some reason it blocks something I want. Like, what if somebody were to post in lfg "Raid training! Come join our guild \[WXYZ\]" or "Are you sick of these Raid Sellers? Come join an actual raid! lf more"
---
I would, literally, pay them to buy the mount with gems in order to bypass more collections.
---
Old LA looked like a city that had people living in it. New LA looks like a plaza in front of a shopping mall.
---
There are a range of budget AMD laptops out there pairing the Ryzen 3 2200U with budget GPUs such as the 560, I wouldn’t recommend anything lower than these. They’re about £370 in the UK, not sure about US prices.
---
The new Ryzen 5-3550H and Ryzen 7-3750H models paired with Nvidia GTX 1650/1660 are a better option for budget laptop gaming but those are over double the price of the R3 laptops. 
---
Laptops quickly get much lower performance in games when you go lower than £350.
---
Besides number of uses? No, I don't believe so.
---
There are sellers who are starting to avoid these characters so they can still show up in the LFG..
---
Imagine if you stopped being an asshole?
---
old game of thrones, not what it became :( sometimes movies, sometimes other tv shows. right now i'm watching a show called black spot and it's making me want to make a norn necro, raven shaman kinda.
---
get exact message.
---
look at the logs.
---
come back.
---
"For fun" *shows pirate LA*
---
I love it. But you cannot colorize the dust of the shield / axe... So it only fits with the armor, if original colors are used. So not usable for me.
---
Great set for axe / shield herald tho. :)
---
skyscale, i got it now though and im kinda out again, waiting for something interesting to be added
---
Same thing for armor boxes from Triple Trouble.
---
I got back last january when PoF was still kinda new. Did some casual open world stuff and randomly found a guild through map chat.
---
That guild got me properly started and gave me a direction what to work for. Starting with ascended trinkets, then gear. Progressively did fractals T1 &gt; T4.
---
Fast forward to now I'm at 7 fully geared characters with 5 legendaries. Currently working towards owning every permanent contract with only the hair stylist missing (rip my wallet). Also progressing through raids with a static group. 
---
IMO having friends playing or finding a guild is one of the best things to do when getting back into the game. What to focus afterwards is up to you then. I personally currently just grind gold to complete personal collections.
---
We just got a huge episode for free, I think the devs should also earn some money.
---
I got back into GW2 about 5 weeks ago in anticipation of War Eternal, and because I'm at a bit of a lull in my gaming, where I'm waiting on further content drops in my other regular game (Warframe) and there hasn't really been any single-player games recently that have caught my eye.
---
I am working towards a legendary.  It's been my goal since not long after I hit 80 in early 2013, but since I don't have the stomach for extended, hardcore grinding sessions, and have only played sporadically since 2015, I still don't have a single one, despite 1,400 hours of playtime.  Originally, I had been aiming for the Bifrost, then when I last got back into GW2 (around PoF launch) I switched to the Shining Blade, and now I'm chasing Exordium.  Fortunately, I had planned stuff out pretty well, so there was very little wasted effort when I swapped my target.
---
I am now on the precipice of finally being able to craft my first Legendary.  I have all the account bound stuff done, all the needed masteries unlocked, and all the gold required.  I am just waiting now for all of the many buy orders I have on the TP to clear.  Hopefully, that happens before the end of the week.  After Exordium, I plan to start chasing Aurora; the only thing I have left for the first set of collections is the Wayfarer's Henge, and I'm about halfway through that abysmal farm.  Once I finish *that*, I'll probably go back to pursuing the Skyscale.
---
Pretty much same as you in that I got back to the game recently after quitting a bit after launch (I came back briefly during Towr of nightmares). The elite specs and all the stuff that came with the expansions have done wonders for this game.
---
Mainly I work towards short term goals. First was the Skyscale (I reinstalled one day before the patch, not knowning it would drop), then Elegy/Requiem armor, then Funerary, a second set of ascended armor...and now I'm thinking of working towards Xiuquatl. Getting the legendaries seems very daunting, specially the condensed gifts since I make most of my money with trophies x.x but we'll see how that goes.
---
I salvaged 2 weapons by accident. I contacted the support and got them back. I was so relieved.
---
The skyscale is great, I second that as a goal.
---
It would be pretty cool if we get attacked by Bubbles / Steve during this festival.  It could be mad that we're celebrating the death of its kin / relatives / whatever, and maybe want to let us experience a little hubris.
---
E.g. clear for gold, clear for fee, etc.
---
In the beginning it was themed like my norn pirate or a human mesmer named Shattered Morals. But more and more it starts with a name that makes me laugh and goes from there.
---
I have a charr named I Has Fleas and tried to make him look fairly fleabitten. I have a norn who's old and craggy called Get off the Lawn, and a guardian named the Guildfather. Originally tried to make him look like Marlon Brando, but that didn't work out.
---
My most recent character is called Social Satyr, a play on social satire and of course, he's using the outfit that gives you hooves.
---
Just remembered I had a sylvari a while ago that I did it the light turquoise and lilac colors like one of those little succulent plants and used the first mawdrey skin as a backpiece.. Can tell I'm addicted to sylvari... Can be alot more creative with them
---
44?! Holy cow, that's a lot! I'm at 17, I think 20 will probably be my limit - after that I would just get overwhelmed with too many choices. O\_O
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Oh yeah I love sylvari for the sheer number of possibilities with colors - my latest attempt at a new character is a sylvari inspired by cactus (the types that have flowers cause I still gots to be pretty ;)), thought that might go well with scourge if I can manage to find a build for that I like. Apparently I'm stuck on necros right now so I figured I might as well lean in to it, as much as I'd like some variety. &gt;&lt;
---
I think what many forget in that regard is that this is happening because of the layoffs or rather why the layoffs happened.
---
The focus is now on GW2 and we see that now with so much attention to what players have asked for.
---
Indeed. But the passive of the signet is wasted on condiThief, since they don't have traits that links crits to conditions. I've thought of using it too, but....still feels like a waste when you could have a utility slot for more dps or better support.
---
I love the amount of events and stuff being added, if anything it's made me the opposite of burnt out. I was being burnt out before, but the new events have given me motivation to bust out a few achievements, unlock a few skins, and do more metas. I love seeing the game alive, and all the people doing all the events and bosses and stuff
---
It turns out, I really like meta events
---
My last character was inspired by a joke about christian priests. My guildmate was talking about people having problems with CC at the meta events, so she told "CC is something to control people..." and I said "cassocks are used to control people, lol". Someone told it would be pretty funny to create a character looking like a priest, so I decided to do it. Now my fresh elementalist looks like a christian priest. I like it. He worship Lyssa, the goddes of ILLUSION and MANIPULATION.
---
My other character was inspired by other game — Half Life 2. I wanted to play holosmith, so I have created a character named Gordan Fraeman. I tried to gave him that look. At least an exo-suit outfit looks great.
---
My norn is stylized as a drunkard, because the background story allows to choose an option  with "Drink too much, don't remember anything".
---
When I want to change style on one of my current characters, then I inspire myself by lore, other organizations in game (i.e. my mesmer is stylized as a White Mantle member - outfit and weapons; I had my asura like an Inquest member), new skins and outfits. Fashion Wars is a great fun, I love this game for it.
---
I play them for a bit and sometimes I'll get an inspiration. Not necessarily in relation to the profession theme.  
---
My necro is themed around her build - ice greatsword, so she's a blue slyvrai with a mix of culture armor and bladed armor. Metal+ice+plant makes an interesting fashion combo. But now I can't switch to a different build cuz then ill lose the ice theme. 😡 can't have that. **Fashion&gt;build**.  
---
I have a chrono that i used the lvl 80 boost on, and once I saw the winged armor I knew I had to make her a fire-nation themed norn.  
---
My mirage is asura, so honestly she's just 'the few light armor skins that look decent on asura female' themed 😬 The most challenging one to fashion. x_x I'll never make an asura again. Fashion Wars on hard mode.
---
When I came back to the game I had only 1 goal. My goal was to get into raids. I knew that for this to happen I need full ascended. I am aware that it's not necessary, but in my mind I wanted to be as ready and well equipped as humanly possible before joining. I have decided what I wanted to play and started gearing it. Everyone will tell you that the first ascended set is the hardest to do, and so will I. It took me several months to finish because of my full time job + university. I got into raids after finishing it and fast forward to today I have thousands of LI and every possible raid achievement yet I still enjoy the game mode. My goal ATM is to learn every single raid role and to able to do it. Also i am currently working on gearing all the possible raid builds that exist atm with the idea of being able to learn and master them at some point. After I am done with my weekly clear I keep joining lfg groups to practice/help or just out of boredom.
---
Okay , yes , it was a bad choice of words. This has been pointed out to me already.
---
I didn't say he was right. I said your comment seemed to miss his point.
---
They never said it was real money? It's still in game money. 'Fake' gold is still a currency
---
Dragon Bash isn't a new festival its a returning festival from 2013.
---
If we hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes should fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.
---
He made more than one point. I wasn't really responding to that point, but I was responding to this from among other things his ;tldr
---
 "It also might, or has, burned out few people out of the game."
---
You can check invisible walls with that chrome online tool Tyria 3D (?)
---
At least i always check for invisible walls there.
---
Nothing worked but fortunely it fixed self after about 16h
---
While it is a shame, I'd highly prefer more stuff like this than a new mobile game that was apparently being worked on.
---
The plethora of shitty memes that have slowly invaded this sub is just so sad. I wish the Mods would really curtail the trend.
---
Even the npc has gone mad while doing the collection.
---
hope it gets destroyed again and build again to look a bit more like the old one.  
---
likely wont happen but i wish it would.
---
good old LA.. standing with guild banner tonic near the bank and watch everyone running to you :D
---
I miss the living world updates.
---
They already said it was within LFG rules since you’re still “forming a group”
---
There is no point in changing it and I dont think any of them do it. If people type -sell its clear they dont want to buy so you wont cater to them. Its like going to a ghetto trying to sell a Ferrari
---
no, we can't!
---
why?
---
1) it would mean official endorsement from anet which is a giant can of worms..they clearly want it to remain a tolerated practice, not a sanctioned one
---
2)just like nobody really checks the "raid(looking for group)" tab, same thing would happen with the sell tab
---
3) related to 2, they could just use that tab for selling if they actually cared about clutter
---
4)at least sellers can be filtered by -sell ! what are we gonna do about all those foreign language lfgs? it's a bigger problem for EU servers than sellers
---
Why would you say it should be against rules?
---
You can revisit it in the personal story. If you're sick of the current Lion's Arch, use one of the capitals or get one of the passes available on the gem store. They're not going to remove the remade city for nostalgia purposes.
---
not really, all of this was already in development for a long time
---
what happens in next 6-12 months will be the result of the course change anet has made
---
and i don't expect anything to be released
---
Yes it is! Just a bit dark on the picture, could not recognize it ^^
---
Its pretty big for a short bow too!
---
I play Chrono in pugs. Raids are 1v10 but 9 of the other team don't know they're fighting. 
---
~~stand in my God damn wells~~
---
Yeah that's a good point, filler, just kinda wish it was just a tad more fresh.  A good example is pretty much anything in the Side Stories category.  All of those past things weren't ground breaking content by any means but it at least had a little bit of depth.  Something along those lines but repeatable.
---
It was in LA during last few days.
---
As a person that cleared and got the new raid title in basically hours I don't relate with most of what you said.
---
&gt;I am personally only intetested in 10 man challenging content.
---
Okay that's fine, you chose a niche and also choose to bitch about being only able to play what you like very 9 months. That makes no sense.
---
&gt;But i guess if you like all the stuff you have much to "play" / afk your way through.
---
Fractals are a great example why this is bullshit. There are other aspects of the game that hardly need you to auto your way to victory IE WvW or PvP.
---
&gt;Why is this not tuned up with 5 people in the instance or made into a fractal/dungeon like experience? Give it repeatability and reason to do it.
---
The only thing I agree on, there are good fights that could be made fractals, Joko or Balthazar are good examples.
---
I really wish GW2 had the Overwatch engine.
---
Shift+click them and copy the name
---
Damn. Thanks for letting me know though. Will try and log into LA daily now.
---
I am quite sad about the cancellations of the other projects, because Anet's artists are just amazing and they always try new things as a company. 
---
But GW2 /really/ needed the attention. I's starting to feel so welcoming and healthy, I hadn't even realized how much a difference that makes. 
---
And those mini events in between bigger patches absolutely are a step in the right direction.
---
While i do agree with you and I myself am a raider and want more challenging content in PvE, the thing is GW2 was never marketed as such game and we have to understand that we are a minority (like 2%). If you want an MMO with more frequent hardcore content releases there is ESO, WoW and FF14. I dont think that GW2 will ever have more frequent raid releases due to them being played by like 2% of the community. Anet cant focus on something that wont sell their game, they have to look at what vontent is being mostly played and work on that (which is obv the story and open world). Not until all players get bored of how easy it is (or atleast a decent percentage) will we see bigger, more frequent hardcore content being released.

1. Shift + Click mini

2. Copy name from chat
---
3. Profit.
---
I wore those holowings for years.
---
Its funny how different my main looks now compared to what it used to look like.
---
I either pick the theme from something I like in real life, or something I like in game. 
---
For example my Daredevil is themed around the Aurora Borealis so there's lots of blues, greens, hints of purple, and a few glowy things. My DragonHunter is ice themed (mainly because I think fire is overrated), so she has the Winter's Heart and Winter's Presence infusions (just 1 of each so it's not obnoxious) and she's dyed with white and blues to keep the details visible. My Mesmer is themed around fractal stuff because I liked the legendary back-piece, so greys, purples, and hints of blue. And so on. I have 1 character for each class, but those are my favorite 3.
---
i only ever run power thieves but i use that sig on every single build just for the Precision alone.
---
And if its a bad dragon then...
---
Yes, D/P is the recommended counter to Sw/D with equally skilled players, but if both running D/P the one who stealths more is not necessarily the winner.  There is more utility on D/P than stealth, and stealth is NOT the reason it's considered the counter.  Blind and greater mobility are the primary reasons that D/P wins over Sw/D.  The stealth aspects can still be easily countered.
---
The festival is mostly old in lore, in implementation, it is very new. It's set in a different city, has new props, items, enemies. 
---
I don't really see a reason to be angry about this. It's a nice nostalgic thing that they are bringing back in between major updates, as with the Four Winds Festival last year. 
---
Every player who joined ~5 years ago or less will witness this festival for the first time.
---
&gt; try new things as a company.
---
What?
---
If you have alot of time to play, or just alot of time on certain days I would suggest to checkout some training raid guilds (search on google: Gw2 raid training guild, you will find a subreddit dedicated to promoting guilds). Join one of them and start doing raids since they are brutally hard at first and a TON of fun. After that you can go for Legendary armor since it gives you more challenge in raids and I myself hate farming but so far Legendary armor has been a blast since for first 2 collections you have to do certain things in fights which make them more difficult/different. Also the story in raids is just pure awesomeness. Furthermore raid currency gets you easy asc gear (you can get 150 currenx per week only tho, but you  can get alot more from drops from the bosses). If you’re not into PvE then I guess WvW but I never did  it seriously myself
---
If you have exotics you can already start getting into raids. Get the appropriate build and learn the rotation and about those encounters and join a training guild to get your hands on experience.
---
In the meantime you can start with fractals. Start with getting Ascended trinkets which will already get you quite high with Agony resistance you can get them a variety of ways like living world episodes or laurel vendors. Ascended weapons can be acquired through the Elite spec weapon collections or crafting and ascended gear through PvP, WvW and crafting. You can also get the drops and don't forget that you can change the attribute combination of any ascended gear through the mystic forge.

- elite specialization system

-underwater weapons and combat
---
Just to name some from GW2. Don't bother to mention that they've not been doing too much during S4, we all know that. It's about the game as a whole.
---
Anet always have been trying new things. Some failed horribly, yes, but that doesn't invalidate the point.

NA?  
---
never encountered this on EU. EU sellers know that if people include -sell, they do not care about buying anything so it doesn't matter if someone sees that or not so they won't do any workaround so you still see ads.
---
when do you realize that nobody on reddit cares? contact Anet.
---
Also known as what every single active mmo does.
---
&gt; and i don't expect anything to be released
---
Just to be clear - you don't expect **anything** to be released?? No raid, no start of season 5, nothing for the next 6-12 months? I find that very very hard to believe. Personally I _expect_ season 5 to start by the end of this year.
---
It's an interesting look but I have several problems and requests:  
---
Obviously, it's just another outfit.  May as well not exist as far as I am concerned.  Because of the all or nothing nature of outfits, I am going to be beyond persnickety with my money when considering buying one, and this one doesn't make muster.  
---
You can dye the smoke on the outfit apparently... While this is neat-o for the outfit itself, they do realize we still can't dye our weapons, right?  IMO that renders the outfit/weapon combo moot, and is very sad because this is far from the only gear set to have this issue.  
---
Neat aesthetic, but are we going to, and staying in, somewhere in the game where this actually fits with our surroundings?  My own biggest gripe about the fashions of late is that they look more and more out of place.  If I were running around with this thing in somewhere like Dragonfall, it fits perfectly with ~2/3 of the zone but the moment I go just about anywhere that isn't dead, on fire, blasted, AKA 99% of the world map, things like this are jarring compared to the art of your surroundings.  Same thing with the aura spam.  
---
It's gone so far that I believe it's time to do some major overheauls and even world rebuilding in the core game zones where people, by stated design intention, tend to spend much of their time when not farming.  
---
Neat boots, would like a version of these as a separate skin, gloves too if they're styled similar.  Same with the visible shoulder piece... Looks like a good old fashioned plate armor pauldron.  I don't need the smoke effects personally, but those pieces by themselves would be nice to have access to. (Headgear too since that seems to be a common request in this thread)  
---
I'd love to have a clean version of that shield skin, no gunk or smoke... It's incredible how good a clean and no-frills skin can look, and even though the art of the game is going to pot with particles and such, not everybody needs all that.  Just saying.  
---
TLDR:  
---
Ultimately my opinion is that a lot of good ideas and interesting designs are included in this gear but they got wrapped in packages that I have no interest in.
---
or block the squad leader, It helps keeping their advertisements out of your lfg permanently.
---
Also known as the exact same thing every MMO does till they die.
---
Sry but i dont trust a "statistic sonewhere" :/
---
Okay buddy
---
That's a pity.
---
New in the Gem Store: Velour Uniforms! Mmmmmmm.
---
I think Cayde would dig this outfit.
---
The main problem is lack of actually new events. They could actually recreate event with focus on that we actually killed 3 ED now. Create special location with teleport from all main cities there (including Amnoon) with new location. Create not one, but 3 holograms, etc, etc. Instead we got event that was there ~5 years ago with reskins. It's about effort that they putted in this event. And they are low. It's just time filler to make ppl farm more. Not like with skyscale\Vision\LegRing we already have incredibly boring bounty farm. I do agree that they could re-use old content, but only if we are sure that there will be NEW event soon. I almost 100% sure that we will get same Halloween later this year. No Joko, no lore. Maybe they will re-use content from the first Halloween...
---
Yeah, Destiny was the first thing I thought of, but Nausicaa for sure as well.  I like it a lot actually, I just have no one I would personally use it on.
---
Hmm, I have no fix - just the same problem :/ I figured it was probably just my mouse bugging, but haven't been able to fix it.
---
So I probably already know the answer to this but just in case: there's no other way of getting the branded relic backpack/glider other than praying to RNGesus and trying to open as many BL chests as possible, right? Do these things usually become available for the statuettes eventually and if so how long until that happens?
---
People moving to other maps was my point tho, before I felt like I could do anything and have people come up to help or tag along. Like I could go do VB for anything and there would be people for whatever reason. Now people just focused on train of Maws, Dopper, Casino, Chak or whatever the order was again. Other maps were empty if it weren't for the vision and skyscale.
---
**I** just wished that these 5-6 events/contents could've been spread to, idk, like 5 months time instead of 2. Would give more "breathing room".
---
But maybe it's just me. I haven't played for years like lot of people here, so lot of stuff are still "on works" for me despite loggin on at least once a day.
---
Is that a site or?
---
Thanks for that.
---
I loved the old Lion's Arch too. Climbing up around the ships felt so unique, and the jumping puzzles were awesome. Especially the one where you fell down the well. The rooftops and ridiculously long JP that's there now just isn't the same. Still love Shark's Maw though.
---
i mean, i know they've done it before, but when it hasn't been in the last year, you can't realistically say that they "always try new things"
---
Guild of Thorns
---
Kind of a weird weapon combo to have a dual set on. Then only two classes that can weild axe and shield together are warrior and guardian, and guardian requires Firebrand to do it.
---
on the contrary. All of them would go there. There's no doubt about that. The problem is that anet will probably never create this category because doing so would be like promoting it, and anet has always be on the sidelines about this, that meaning: "we have nothing against it but do it at your own risk.".
---
And i say risks because there are risks. Like:
---
- Either part not meeting their part of the agreement.
---
- Fraud on the source of the gold/MC/whatever used for the transaction. Anet has stated that quite a bunch of times the gold used by buyers on these transactions comes from an ilegal source (RMT) and that means that it will be deleted sooner or later. And if by the time it's deleted the gold is already on the hands of the raid seller the gold will be deleted from him. Not to mention temporary bans and similar.
---
Considering how completely they ended the LS4 storyline I'll be shocked if this festival isn't going to be another major enemy's story kickoff lol
---
"Burn me, its a stingray"
---
Please please please please please someone do this on EU servers. :). I'll even admit to owning a fully geared Chrono if it helps.
---
Im just grateful i atleast get some events
---
An easy fix would be to type in the search field "-sell"
---
&gt; e.g. in instances or in regards to new mounts
---
can you go into more detail? if i'm forgetting or have missed something, i'd love to know about it. btw, releasing a new mount is not the same as trying something new
---
GW2 is the only mmorpg I want to stay in right now.
---
It‘s more like a Community on discord
---
Thats BS  if I have to say it in kind words...
---
Special offer today! Chak Egg Sak for 20k gold, only available to group members! Join Now!
---
You only get one charge per map. Unless you have an empty slot for a character you can recycle to map the racial cities, you're stuck having to map a lot of maps that gave more than just PoIs and vistas.
---
I’m not a fan of the stance but I understand it. I believe a raid bulletin board would be better
---
An event with dragon in the name? Pleeease let the fire breathing longbow skin be a reward somewhere in all of this!
---
Gold -&gt; Gems
---
To me, it actually came across as the cloth was literally disintegrating into that mist aura. If you look at the right side of the outfit, you'll notice the arm is exposed and corrupted (?) And the fabric and armor on the leg is also torn. I think that might be why the dyes are bound together like that.
---
To be fair, when we killed Zhaitan and Modremoth, we had no idea it was going to be so bad for the world. And we had to kill Balthazar or he would have killed Kralkatorrik and ended the world since there was no dragon to replace him.
---
gw2 efficiency is not good for this kind of stats. For example, only 28% of accounts on gw2 efficiency finished the last story episode. But we can't say less than 30% of players play story. If someone made an account in 2014 and didn't log in the game for 5 years he will still be counted in stats on efficiency even if he didn't play for 5 years.
---
&gt; one of the first games to focus on a dynamic event system
---
Rift was like 1 year before GW2? So saying "One of the first games" is literally "One of the first copypaste", yeah. Sure, new thing. 
---
&gt; adding new WvW and PvP maps (half of which the playerbase ends up hating, but still)
---
Oh my. Adding new map! So all expansions\LWS now "new things as a company"?
---
&gt; revolutionized the mount system
---
erm....well..sure. If you think so...
---
&gt; various new mechanics (e.g. gravitational) and stretching of the engine capabilities in S4
---
But we are talking about company? But if you prefer to talk about game and engine, sure. We can?
---
&gt; underwater weapons and comba
---
Which was forgotten? Surely new thing. NEVER seen before ANYWHERE. Don't forget. GW2 one of the first game where you can JUMP. Or FLY.
---
&gt; mastery system (which is in many ways a fuckup but also new to the genre)
---
That's not NEW as company. It's NEW in THIS game. Not in the game industry. Not in the world.
---
Wait, my griffon can go up?!
---
We got episode 6 with skyscale.
---
2 weeks later we got Vision.
---
2 weeks later we got raid.
---
Next 2 weeks and we getting Dragon Bash.
---
It seems 2 week content release cadence is back!
---
If you have a keyfarm char you can use another workaround for all the items where you have to type the name, just stack all the things on the char before you delete him once a week.
---
Yeah, at the moment there is no other way to obtain the Branded Relic Package or its contents. And the statuette panel is updated with whatever they want, whenever they feel like it, so there's no real pattern to what they put for statuettes, or even guaranteed that it'll ever be available for statuettes.
---
no, previews raid was with the episode
---
The standart snowflake casual won't use websites like efficiency. I guess it's less than 10% of the actuall playerbase, probably less than 5%
---
Yes I noticed this happened RIGHT when I changed mouses, and at first I thought it was a mouse issue but nope, it is a game issue.
---
It started happening like 2 months ago? I think the patch where wvw cat mount dropped. That's when it began happening.
---
I'm talking about your first issue, the hold and wiggle one.
---
Unfortunately it hasn't been fixed ever since.
---
So like me did you join a German server by accident? 
---
I'm also from India but I get 150-180 ping... Mostly 170ish. Your connection is nice...
---
Yeah I might have to swap out arcane for earth cause right now I'm playing fresh air tempest with arcane cause I like the buffs it gives
---
You also probably have more people with multiple accounts where they don't raid at all/ don't raid on those, so it will equal out if not make the number smaller I'd guess.
---
We've all seen enough body bags and ball sacks.
---
"Okay with it" and "endorsing it" are *very* different things. It's one thing to say "This doesn't violate any of our rules so it can continue", but adding a separate LFG listing for raid selling would be a tacit "Yeah go ahead and just pay other people to avoid playing our game" which is... not an ideal position for a game developer to officially take. IMO, that's the only reason we'll probably never get any selling tabs, and personally I think it's adequate. I wouldn't be upset if they added one, but it's just really unlikely.
---
It doesn't look like anyone is actually living in NLA.
---
In my opinion, raid sellers should only be allowed to advertise their group, if they are ready to go and have all raiders that will profit from the sale in the squad already.
---
Keep in mind that GW2 efficiency give you stats based on peoples that have put their API code in the website. Only a small part of the community do this. We can safely assume that most casuals (that doesn't raid) are not counted in those stats.
---
So this 20% is also biased.
---
The commander: You see, dragons have a preset kill limit. Knowing their weakness, I sent wave after wave of my own men at them, until they reached their limit and shut down.
---
This can cause a bit of collateral. If the advertiser also does normal raid runs, you won't be able to see them. It might be worth it for some, but weigh the options versus just filtering out sellers with search.
---
i just want the helmet
---
Which feels completely out of place. Someone saw the names and thought it was a good idea, somehow.
---
The future is full of darkness.

[Here she is.](https://imgur.com/a/Y76gN)
---
Sylvari because the natural glow on the cultural armor works so well for the theme, the glowing blue eye mask, the exalted shoulders, storm gloves, and Aether for the shortbow. 
---
Her name is Aurora Laena which is a play on Aurora for her theme and Laena which is "mantle" or "cloak" in latin. So she's literally Cloaked in Aurora.
---
GW2 welcoming returning players; final of Season 4(very beautiful map); new Mount;  returning of 2013 event. I feel so excited about this game as a newly joined player. 
---
*It is super effective!*
---
&gt; Players may use the tool to sell a spot in a group—because that can be part of the group formation process—but they may not use it for the sales or trades of items, nor for any other purpose.
---
[x](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/349/policy-looking-for-group-lfg-tool/)
---
I don't think they'd accept "Selling group spot for 20k gold, group members get a chak egg sac as a gift" as not selling an item
---
I hope so, it could be some really interesting plot to move forward, specially now that the Mists have been damaged so badly by Kralkatorrik.
---
Welp. Guess I'll try and get some keys from map completion before the chest contents change and hope for the best? :/ Really feels like there should be SOME other way to get these things other than RNG, even if the only other way is "pay 2000 gold for it on the TP" - at least then it's possible and a decision of whether it's worth that much to me. I dislike being at the mercy of random chance.
---
Don't forget one of first to do instanced loot/nodes/whatnot. No fighting against other players.
---
that's flawed logic.
---
1) Some people might not know it's a thing and can be introduced to it in the current LFG setup
---
2) People dont know how to block. And if they do they block them cause they dont want to buy, no loss for them. And shit resets anyway every time you open the menu
---
3) If someone were to buy a run they would find them there, they aren't suddenly unable to do so if its mixed up with normal groups
---
So this wouldn't increase their business in anyway
---
&gt; "duh that's kind of what theme park mmos do"
---
No lie there. :)
---
But GW2 seems to have it on another level, and that's where it gets frustrating. With other MMOs I've played, I could finish the main part of it in a day or three then move on. GW2 wants an hour+, per day, for two weeks, for a sliver of reward so the player has to come back next year.   
---
Granted, it's some long-range thinking, finally, and I can appreciate the newer event format.
---
And I don't feel "forced" to do it. I skipped the last SAB, only did a bit of Halloween and Wintersday. I'm not that into the rewards anyway.  
---
I am glad to see Dragon Bash come back. I've had both holographic wings since the first event, and now newer folks will have a chance at them.
---
Oh, she's beautiful! Love the name too! Really wish I could get my hands on the exalted shoulders, they are so lovely. Also hadn't seen the storm gloves before and now I have another item on my ever-growing wishlist!
---
what we need are combined stats. people that completed last story and say the first raidboss of w7, that'll be more telling, even though many raiders don't really play story. ideally we could just select stats for accounts that were active in the last X months (I.e. adding playtime above a certain threshold), but being able to use 2 achievements together would already help a lot to filter out dead accounts.
---
I am not arguing if devs pay a lot of attention or no attention to the gamemode, I'm saying you can't "win" at those just autoing
---
Thank you! \^\_\^
---
Eventually it'll probably cycle around to either the skin vouchers or the BL statues.
---
It would be nice if you were sent to the old LA as long as you're not done with the personal story and got the destroyed version when on the Season 1 recap story journal "chapter". Then, getting to new LA with season 2 would feel more like a progression.
---
It would help with the story flow until, I hope, they do a remake of S1.
---
We'd all love it if they moved from the RNG box to just selling the damn cosmetics in the gemstore with everything else, but apparently they must get more money throwing them in BL chests or something... sigh. Can't wait for every country to go Belgium on them so they're forced to sell directly.
---
IIRC some of the patch notes after the big meta patch mentioned that they fixed the stall bug. So, not all of it, apparently?
---
This might be special case: 
---
I and my sibling have a glossary of our own drawn characters. We choose some of them we like the most and fit them into the GW2 universe. 
---
We'll see which races look more suitable for the characters and create them. We don't care about the lore when naming them. (&gt;µ&lt;)l 
---
Profession: well see which fits the chara best. *we have yet to create a Ranger xD*
---
Weapon: same as above. But sometimes would bring a most effective weapon than the look. 
---
Skill: select those fits the chara most! While using the most effective most of the time. (v_v) 
---
Armor: whatever fits the character's personality. 
---
Colour: we don't care about the casted skill colour. We choose what we want to see on the armor. And we don't see the skills when idling right, just surprise anyone.
---
For me, there has been a stall every day the past 3 days, including last night at 3 am est (post patch)
---
Someone was actually able to make a Zapp cosplay in game.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5aaok2/my_costume_this_halloween/
---
Now instead of 0% chance to do it i have ~3%. Out of 7 tries last three days i got success only one on 3rd instance.
---
Many raiders did the skyscale at least for the max masteries, maybe to idle 2 meters from the boss while waiting for rc.
---
Joke aside, I admit though that only my main did the story but I do raids on all my accounts, both scenarii happens
---
The main problem of gw2efficiency is not the dead players but the fact that a minority of the accounts are considered (didn't check the reste of the post but would be great having figures of people recently online on gw2 and on gw2efficiency plus globally the total of accounts
---
To be fair LA is garbage now, I wouldn't want to celebrate there either.
---
1.) There are only two options which is dumb.
---
2.) What purpose would this strawpoll serve even if it was better created?
---
3.) What is this subreddit's obsession with strawpoll in general?
---
Yes, arenanet can make everything cannon though there is a difference between an easter egg and the thing that is suggested here.
---
&gt; We have the mists. Strange things happen there.
---
That is correct but also a counter argument, LA is not in the mists. Now a Portal could open up in LA and somehow replace it with new lions arch but the problem is a different one.
---
The problem is more of the explanation of this. LA was destroyed in season 1, rebuild and then somehow replaced with a pre-destruction version from the mists. now this would make sense right now because you can't play season 1 at the moment so players who haven't played season 1 will not see that as a problem.
---
But now imagine season 1 comes back. Maps don't change depending on where you are in the story so they would play season 1, lions arch is getting destroyed and they are back in old, not destroyed lions arch. This will create an inconsistency that will only be solved after they played the story when this "incident" with the mist would happen again.
---
And splitting up into different version might not even work at all and would create additional work to A) integrate everything they added so far back into that old version and B) let players choose in which instance they want to go but since there is no capability of this anywhere in which you proactively select this I don't really see this happening.
---
I noticed some weird issues last night while playing. I rely on right click to look around the majority of the time and it was being really iffy last night.
---
no this should be fine because they clearly advertise when they want to form that group, raid sellers mostly dont
---
Where is the option: I want old Lions Arch and events taking place in DR and Hoelbrak ?
---
good point, thanks for the info
---
Quality analysis. Get my upvote
---
DAE old LA better than new LA????
---
They mentioned it when they explained their point of view about "selling raids" on the oficial forums. Can't find the post but it was quite long ago. 
---
But it makes sense. RMT gold is ussually used to purchase high priced things, and raids sells are not cheap, specially when a new wing is released. Anet deletes the gold/items of any RMT whenever they detect it and it doesn't matter who has the currency at the moment. So if you use RMT gold to purchase a raid run the gold will be in the hands of the raid seller.
---
However it's true that since this policy was in effect it has caused many problems. For example, the most controversial one. I put an Eternity for sale on TP and someone purchases it using RMT gold. That resulted in the seller losing his/her gold (obviously the buyer also lost their Eternity). As you can imagine this made the community angry since you can't control who purchases your items. Anet realized it was their mistake and took measures to avoid "punishing innocents". Since now raid runs are rarely paid in raw gold but using alternative currencies like MC it's very possible that it has already passed any check that anet had placed because ussually the buyer would use the RMT gold to purchase the MC for the run. But caution is needed because RMT also goes for items, so if someone RMTed directly MCs from the third party those MCs would be the ones deleted. In any case those declarations were done long ago and i'm sure that anet keeps updating their RMT detection methods (which obviously are not going to be made public). So maybe right now it's not a big problem as it used to be.
---
I only come back for events. Especially sab
---
winter's bite downed me the other week and i was suprised,it was about 18k dmg....   
---
The last other person i remember one-shotting me was the reworked berserkera after the patch, i had about 3secs to respond and nothing could be done :D from max hp to zero in about 3 secs, 3 ticks? then again mes dps maximsied with weapon swap under certain builds or three or 4 thief unloads on dp could take you from max hp to zero in about 5-6 seconds  
---
imo i think the game does need some more fine tuning for the survivability / balance / challange aspects
---
did you even read the book? and the wiki agrees with me.
---
Besides Fort Marriner is INSIDE LA claw island is OUTSIDE LA.
---
I just wanted to know if people liked the old way better or the new way. thats why "Old LA with events in other cities" isn't an option.
---
I hide all the commander comics, they went way past their "best before" day already 
---
Here's to more WvW stuff though
---
I have 14 characters. Not as many as some altoholics out there, but I only got back into the game roughly 9 months ago after taking an extended hiatus post-release (my old laptop didn't do the experience justice, and I enjoy it quite a bit more on a proper gaming computer).
---
I draw inspiration from new cosmetics sometimes, but usually I come up with DnD characters that I (in my limited artistic ability) then want to see translated into a medium where I can recreate my mental image of them a bit easier. Other times, I get inspired by other media, games, tv shows, etc.
---
I almost always have a character concept before setting out to create it in-game (character slots are expensive and I don't like deleting characters if it can be avoided.) I created a Soulbeast when the Winter Antlers set appeared for sale around Wintersday, and created a stag-based character, a symbol of natural vengeance, the prey that fights back. I created a female Charr Scourge, once a human countess but twisted by her dark and blood magics into a feral beast (employs the bloodstone visage and bloodstone dyes heavily). I created a male Sylvari Firebrand, a Largos that escaped the prisons he was kept in by his own people. He and the other prisoners recounted stories of their lives and journeys, and he found himself empowered by each story he heard until one day he was able to escape his confinement. He employs the Warbeast pants and the Shackles of Madness as he is a convict on the run.
---
~20% of efficiency, which are ~20% of the playerbase, so I'm quite close with my less than 5%
---
Ah, OK, tyvm for the info. I wish ANet could send this item to all players who participated (just like during meta-event thing).
---
Can we have both versions of Lion’s Arch? Actually, make it more than two. I also want battle damage Lion’s Arch. And I’m glad we have an event in Hoelbrak. I’d also like Meatoberfest in the Black Citadel.
---
sham-paggen
---
Sad your participation doesn't count through a 0AP achievement.
---
Sylvari design notes from the art of gw2 book paraphrase:
---
"At first the sylvari were going to be elves with some floral accents. But we were like "nah, that's too boring" so we made them into a race of fully realized plant creatures because that's more fun"
---
Who hurt you to make you so bitter?
---
I thought we were obsessed with downvoting. I suppose strawpoll ain't that bad in comparison
---
i'm so confused, what are the shiny weapons anyway?
---
How well received are non meta builds?
---
I don’t really care about festivals. I usually participate a couple days and then I’m done since it’s nothing really new.
---
Events on the other hand are great in my opinion. Lately I’ve only logged on for new living world map and then returned to other games, but I haven’t taken a hiatus from this game for a while now since it has more going on atm. 
---
I understand your point about needing some downtime, it’s valid. But I personally haven’t had an issue finding groups for metas at whatever time I decide to do them. I also don’t constantly do them though.
---
wasn't the fix for junundu, which also had a stalling bug? not entirely sure, but ai don't remember maw changed.
---
Funny story, but this morning I was capping camps for the daily before I went to work.  Tried to get blue's north camp and was going 1v1 against a Rev.  Fight was pretty even for a while, then this projectile hits me, knocks me back, and takes almost half my health.  Dammit! I thought, he's got a Soulbeast helping him!  I got downed and stomped shortly thereafter.
---
I didn't have time to run around anymore so I checked the combat log during my dirtnap.  Turns out it wasn't a Ranger, but the other guy was manning a Ballista.  I had mixed emotions about the fact I thought it was a Ranger Longbow.
---
What’s the name of the achievement? Can’t find it anywhere..
---
As far as i read that article. In GW2 you basically zerg any event. And GW2 copy-paste from Rift actually worse? Impact terms, zerg terms, rift wins in this cases?
---
&gt; I never said LA is in the mists. I'm saying portals to the mists can fuck things up in Tyria, so why can't one of those things be bringing a place back in time?
---
well, I already said that this was possible.
---
&gt; it's not
---
how do you know? It might or it might not but we don't know.
---
&gt; how would keeping new LA be any better for consistency with it's story?
---
because old LA got destroyed and rebuild. Pretty easy for the consistency. 
---
&gt; It's entirely a non issue.
---
well, it obviously wouldn't be in the format on release but I think we both know that the playerbase wants Season 1 back than having old lions arch back mainly because it is an integral part of the story that you can't play.
---
&gt; And when did I say anything about letting people choose which LA to enter?
---
This was the point I made because I was hitting on the timeline consistency which, if you wanted to do right would need to provide. Personal story and season 1 -&gt; Old lions arch, then new lions arch until the point the mist would somehow replace new lions arch again.
---
&gt; Where you around at launch? There's a reason why so many of us miss old LA. It was much better designed place. There was sewers, verticality. A lot of work went into this city, ultimately for nothing.
---
Actually, I was playing this game since the beta and yes old LA was great but also pretty dark and. well, old. While I don't like the "sea"-ish look of new LA I like how light it is and not so dark as old LA was.
---
&gt; A lot of work went into that city, and they just hit delete on it.
---
That is, unfortunately, the consequences you have to consider releasing content in a format that changes the world.
---
I think the best solution would have been in season 4. Kralkatorrik influenced the mists and replaced new LA with the Old one before it was destroyed.
---
In the end, it is a matter of opinion. If you like the old one more then that is okay but I didn't want to break a discussion about which one is better but rather how this would fit into the game and make it plausible and not just good old mists just happen to have a bad day and swallow lions arch and for whatever reason turn back the clock while totally throwing the whole work they did for new lions arch out of the window just because people don't like it because that is pretty much what you say by arguing that "Designing an incredibly detailed city, only to destroy it in the games first season".
---
And it was free, and the developers deserve to earn some money.
---
well... judging from the downvotes i got for posting a strawpoll, i would say this sub is still obsessed with downvoting :P
---
Anyone know what's up with snowcrows/metabattle websites? They're not showing about half the pictures in any of the browsers I've tried (Chrome and Edge) so I can't use the builds there. Do they work for anyone else? If so, mind telling me at least what the spec choices are for power daredevil?
---
Don't forget to also smash
---
yes an exotic sword called  Old ascalon
---
why are you so angry? 
---
I wasn't asking for Old LA to return. I was just wondering what people prefer. geez.
---
It's a known issue with the API being broken.  Anet is aware and working on it.
---
If their pipe is 6-9 months we won't actually know the result of the layoffs and restructuring until season 5 has already started. That's going to be the telling sign of how much they're devoting to GW2.
---
ctrl+c, ctrl+v
---
I think 15 of those minutes is just my loading screens lol
---
Go for a legendary weapon that isnt from the original set.  You have to go through three tiers to get the pre cursor which has challenges from all over Tyria.  It's a lot of fun.  That's what made me craft my first legendary, HOPE.  It's a little bit of a grind but it's fun to do. Shortly after that I worked on crafting Frostfang twice for my warrior and I now have the Twice Told Legend title.  Always wanted that title since the beginning.
---
To view the separate damage coefficient, just click on the WvW/PvP toggle bar, above the skill details when you are on the Wiki. If a skill has multiple values, you can view all of them through the toggle options there.
---
old lion arch?
---
Like, from GW1? Okay, count me in. Henge of Denravi, too, pls.
---
 I saw what you described for YOUR characters and i was like " WTF he talking about , there definitely ARE weapons that fit that description."   I have a Guardian bookkeeper for example there's TONS of focuses that are tomes/scrolls and there's even Binding of Ipos legendary which is a book for example.
---
IN any case , for me I generally get inspiration from 2 things:
---
1- I have my own side story for GW2 for my own characters that runs parallel to story. so none of my characters are The commander but rather know of the commander , hear about the commander and at points are present during important events in the commanders story but never directly interact. Therefore My character/s need a full party/cast of characters to interact with and so a create those in alts.
---
2- Inspiration from cosplay/characters i like from other franchises and then go from there. I say " Ok i want a character to be somewhat like x character" and then start looking at armor, weapons appearance that looks like that, from there on i go into the first inspiration and edit from there.
---
For PVE i am purely following those even on weapon choice and skills/abilities/pets
---
I only switch for sake of Builds during Raids or so but I play disregarding " Meta" or  " proper builds" in PvE  and rather go  Theme based. I also get a more challenging game play out of it
---
I been meaning to start rewritting my  side story/headcanon/fanfic and post it along with pics of my characters on  Reddit just for fun but i been lazy lately
---
Can you give an example of a non-meta build you're considering?
---
Connected to donations? There are a few such ones: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Donate_to_the_scientist_to_help_unlock_Mystic_Forge_secrets#Related_achievements
---
no, another charr
---
 &gt;I don't expect anything to be released
---
&gt;I find that very hard to believe.
---
&gt;meant anything that I care about
---
Reddit in a nutshell
---
Explain every f2p MMO that does free content updates then, which have cash shops of varying importance.
---
Guess it is when less than 10% of the game even bothers to try  
---
But hey, keep cherry picking and pretending like finding a solid, reliable raid group who can actually clear the content isn't also part of the problem for people.
---
My first few characters were pretty simple. One was a charr I basically gave my general personality, and let it kind of grow naturally to fit the character and the world. The other two were humans based on characters I've written in other stuff.
---
When I got into GW1, naturally I made character reincarnations of my GW1 mains.
---
Sometimes I'll make characters based on certain ideas presented in the game. During LS1, I made an Ash Legion warrior who infiltrated the Aetherblades to get closer to Scarlet. During LS3, I made a Krytan ranger who was raised by White Mantle parents and turned away from her upbringing. Not long after the personal story, I made an asura working as an enforcer for the Arcane Eye, as kind of a behind-the-scenes manipulator with the intent of having the asura reign supreme over the other races sooner than later.
---
Or sometimes I'll make ones based on fashion/themes/personalities that just sound fun and go from there.
---
But he said not one of us could hope to defeat him...
---
You are not required to participate everything ... I've skipped SAB 3 years in a row. Will probably stop doing the current one as soon as I get 3 more crimson.
---
you didn't understand the part you quoted and you didn't read the books apparently.
---
the book Sea of Sorrows tells the entire story since Lion's Arch is flooded, to when it is rebuilt 
---
&gt;Their city was destroyed, only to be rebuilt in defiance of the Elder Dragon's power.
---
this refers to the great tsunami and progressive repair of LA into a pirate city into what we saw at GW2 release. 
---
LA was never destroyed second time, until Scarlet.
---
stop spreading lies as canon lore just because you can't read
---
What about selling potatoes in an auction in dhuum's throne room?
---
Perfect time to come back, as they’ve been bringing out infusions frequently it may be the case here too! Also, let me know; if your move speed is significantly decreased by carrying all that gold I’d be happy to assist you :)
---
My favorite counter are weakness, blind and some line CC, but it depends heavily in my surrounding awareness. Any surprise attack in stealth would down me for sure.
---
Thank you very much! This was not what I hoped, but this was exactly what I expected. :)
---
You missed the living world campaigns that take place between the expansions. It’s probably better to go play those or read about them. They’re just as important as the xpac stories.
---
Would do this if windows had more than one clipboard
---
Yes, as I said in other post of this thread.
---
Someone downvoted you lmao
---
Keyboard macros are always helpful for things like these
---
Thanks! I've figured out the target dummy thing earlier and oh boy it saved a lot of frustration already. But that Vehtendi Academy thing is new for me, have to try it out. Although I think I'm quite fast with answering all students and it's one of the fastest hearts I know already, but there's always room for improvement. :)
---
Nah, it wouldn't. The sellers are not some dubious scammers, they are highly respected guilds of famous players. I'm sure that if they got their own LFG tab, they would adhere to the rules.
---
I’m really loving the new releases of content! It seems to be going in a really good direction, and it keeps me excited to play each week. TBH I’m not even sure why there’s so much fear mongering; even if you aren’t getting exactly what YOU want, it’s hard to deny, there’s new things coming out regularly now - like the World Boss event, the meta events, an old festival being revived, etc.
---
I think we’re gonna see an upswing in content and quality, to be honest. Even if it’s not exactly what one individual wants, quantity often leads to quality, and at this rate I think we’re gonna get some awesome things coming up.
---
Sounds like you missed the Living Story episodes.   In addition to the base game+expansions, there are story chapters called "Living Story", split into different seasons.  
---
Living Story Season 1 was limited time content, no longer available. There's a quick summary you can get from an NPC in Lion's Arch, and people have made some good YouTube videos summarizing it.  It introduced the members of Dragon's Watch.
---
Living Story Season 2 bridges the gap between the end of Season 1, leading into HoT.  It's when Caithe suddenly becomes not so nice.  It also talks a lot about a character named Scarlett Briar.  Scarlett was the main villain of Season 1.
---
Living Story Season 3 bridges the gap between HoT and PoF.  It introduces Aurene, and the villain of PoF.  It also deals with some lingering non-dragon plot threads hanging around since launch, mostly human related. 
---
Living Story Season 4 comes after PoF, and has us fighting against first Joko, then Kralkatorrik, all while trying to come up with solutions to problems raised by LS3 and PoF.
---
Each available season (so 2, 3, &amp; 4) was available for free to players who logged in while each episode was current, but for people who missed it, they are available on the gem store.  You own Episode 6 of Season 4 now, and if you stick with the game, you will get each episode of Season 5 for free, as it releases.  Season 2 and 3 are roughly $15-20 USD each iirc, or around 300-400 gold each, at current exchange rate. Season 4 is a bit cheaper right now, at around $10, or 250 or so gold. They do go on sale semi-regularly too.
---
IMO, Season 2 is kind of a poor value proposition, unless you're just really, really into the story, but Seasons 3 &amp; 4 come with a lot more than just new story beats, and so are much more worth it.
---
I like it because it's got a look and theme I've wanted for a while but damn it really triggers my OCD tendencies by having the trail only on one side and not as a free flow effect. I think it would be better if the effect was like an aura with a trail instead of looking like some static animation with wind only blowing from one side.
---
I had right click/camera issues in the past, usually it was some overlay problem. 
---
Now it with the last patch it's just like you described, it's really annoying and makes playing harder.
---
Many camp lfgs on alt accounts for that reason - don’t feel too bad
---
Pretty sure that's what made them go into hibernation 10,000 years (or whatever) ago.
---
Beautiful!
---
Try changing polling settings on mouse, it may or may not help
---
Go at your own pace!
---
Your guides are very good with all the editing.
---
Totally agree. In addition, don't be afraid to ask in map chat "wtf is this?" when you come across something new
---
The PoF buy page says only deluxe and up gets a character slot.
---
What version did you buy?
---
D:
---
Heh no arguments about that. In fact I think the whole "main" concept is outdated ...
---
You want wintersday a festival that has so much human lore in it to be in the black citadel. Really
---
I would read up on /r/gw2economy in general, and look for comments from the mods on this reddit for some generally sound advice on the current economy. I would also start looking into how to do your own market research with the tools on silveress.net, gw2eff, gw2bltc, etc.
---
Technically you'd get a set of each weight, as the recipes you unlock are some of the cheapest in the game. As others have said, great options are alacrity renegade and support chrono. For medium armor, idk right now
---
Don't worry - you can always gems to gold. :)
---
If you're new, the conversion rate might seem scary, but you can save enough in no time.
---
Raid lfg is the new spamadan
---
Exactly, did a non-Skritt design her? Not anime enough!! /s
---
Transfuse into a signet rezzing a group of people and saving the raid. Such a damn good feeling!
---
I don't PvP much but I definitely see that as a problem, balancing between PvE and PvP is hard, especially when it comes to CC
---
i know that entrance to gendaraan is still there i was talking about the entrance to the snowy part of the map which is 100% no longer there. as for lornaars ill check once ik back from work
---
I'm an RPer but I'm cishet (BOO, HISS, I know), so I don't think I qualify.
---
wow these are just awesome.
---
Old, bc I don't wish to go to DR.
---
Both avenues still exist.  They only removed them when we were in Broken LA.  After LA was repaired again, the portals returned.  The Lornar's Portal is just in a cave on the easy side (I believe near the wedding pavilion.) and the gendarrian one is in the Mystic Forge/Crafting area (it's a huge door, you can't miss it, I promise).  
---
and then there is still the southern exit into Bloodtide as well.  :)
---
If you want to heal in Open World &gt; WvW &gt; Fractals you should go for Minstrel, Guardians have a very low HP pool and GW2 Worldevents are a total clusterfuck to begin with so additional tankyness really helps.
---
If you alter your build (not your gear) for a bit more condi damage you can leech on every Mob and even tag everything while leatherfarming in Lake Doric. So even with full Minstrel, full Tank you can easily get rewards for killing.
---
If you care about Raids &gt; Fractals you go Harrier. You don't want to toughness-tank taunt Bosses and in Raids you also need the additional Boonduration (Minstrel only has like 70%). Beware that with Harrier compared to Minstrel you loose about 20% Healingthroughput from equip alone, up to 40% depending on selected Traitlines, also you're way less tanky!
---
I can't stress Tankyness enough, in Open World you will sit at a 11k HP pool much like full DamageDealer and therefore will likely be twoshot by all those Bossmechanics and random AoEs (looking at Death-Branded Shatterer, Tequatl, Palawadan, Chak Gerent etc. any Worldboss event you name it).
---
In Fractals with daily random nasty Instabilitys your HP pool sometimes diminishes down to somewhat 7k HP if "Fragile" is up. Good luck dodging mechanics, especially in T4 or you will be - you guessed it - oneshot!
---
In Fractals with those Fractal-Potions Minstrel Boonduration is no issue since you get an increase based on Agony Resistance, so your 70% gets buffed to about 85%-90% whereas Harrier will overcap with about 10% since you cant get higher as 100% Boonduration everything beyond that is litterally wasted.
---
Damage on a Healer is not required in Instanced Content, Druids much like Tempests deal no damage at all so your bonus Power from Harrier doesn't really matter --. If you buff Aegis and Stability and provide a smooth run, your DamageDealers dps will most likely increase by an insane amount and thats more than you could pull off with healer equip tbh.
---
I really don't care about healer dps srsly wtf!
---
In WvW you really want to run Minstrel since Harrier Firebrand die in one push, or are most likely oneshot by any enemy Soulbeast, Deadeye or Revenant.
---
Choose your equip depending on what you are and where you want to go, as mentioned full Minstrel with Condition Firebrand Traits will be enough to tag and whore on everything as long as there are other players around wich kill Mobs that you also then get the credit for.
---
If you plan on fully solo everything maybe look into a real dps spec like Dragonhunter since healers usually struggle solo killing stuff ...
---
not that entrance to gendaraan, the other one to the snowy part is no longer there.
---
Update us on your third, and also all the next attempts as well please.
---
Hopefully someone does!
---
im thinking dragon festival, derp
---
Thankfully they allow for split-balance. They can tweak damage, cooldowns, and effect duration in that mode without changing it in PvE. I really like your suggestions, I just think they'd scrap some of the CD shortening for the sake of PvP/WvW. And that'd be fine all the same!
---
I'm currently working on getting the Skyscale. For me it is a very fun collection process.
---
After that I will try and get the new legendary trinket Vision, I've never made a legendary before so it should be nice.
---
how does one get cosplay posts upvoted but when i do a inFAMOUS 2nd son i dont get a single notice?
---
chrono forever
---
Dragon Bash is the best celebration for Norn.
---
Now we need Meatoberfest in the Black Citadel and Pale Mother's Day in the Grove, and each city will finally have their own festival, and we can move to bringing back S1.
---
Try harder
---
I hope someone else can respond to you and give a good response.  My experience has been that the movement of Folke is fixed by letting enemies attack him, which he then runs towards.  This forces him onto a correct path it seems.  Again, this is based on my limited knowledge and what I've seen.  So to avoid the bug, it seems to be that you need to not run in front of the npc, allowing the enemies to agro onto him.
---
Please utilize the PrintScreen button on your keyboard. Failing that, use Snipping Tool or download one.
---
Why? (and for what)
---
The idea is that Scepter is just better than Longbow. Better damage, shorter cooldowns, and you can pair it with a Focus for even better tools than LB can offer.
---
It's probably not that LB is useless, it's that it's just noticeably worse than Scepter as a ranged weapon.
---
Arah Chestpiece and Reaper's hood in all dark colors. You don't see that every day. /s
---
&gt;- mastery system (which is in many ways a fuckup but also new to the genre)
---
How is the mastery system a fuckup? Besides some growing pains with HoT, it's been working pretty well.
---
&gt;- underwater weapons and combat
---
I'm not entirely sure they were the first. I seem to remember at least one game before GW2 that had underwater combat, but I could be misremembering.
---
yeah :D
---
You do NOT want to help us. So just give up on that lie right now. Nobody's falling for it. Anti-gay conservatives like you have NEVER done anything to help LGBT people. E.V.E.R. Seriously, name a SINGLE thing you've ever done to help LGBT people. 
---
You NEVER see anti-gay or conservative lobbying groups doing anything to help HIV research or charities. Instead you try to push things like conversion therapy which is proven to be harmful and to cause suicide. You probably want to criminalize homosexuality which in many places would mean the death penalty. Conservatives like you want it to be legal for landlords and employers and healthcare providers to discriminate against us leaving us jobless, homeless and dead. Your kind of attitude leads to parents tossing out their LGBT kids into the streets which then often leads to them falling victim to human trafficking and/or dying. Conservatives like you are also the ones who, if you had your way, would happily tear apart LGBT families, annul all LGBT marriages and take away kids of LGBT parents and throw them back into our broken foster care system.
---
None of that helps ANYONE. Killing us is not helping us.
---
The goal of conservatives isn't to "help" us, it's to erase us from existence. Our existence shatters many of their assumptions about gender and sexuality, so it'd be easier for them if we didn't exist. When they want to keep it legal to force children into conversion torture camps, the goal is to either repress us or cause us to commit suicide, either way the result is us not existing anymore.
---
hello, use r/GuildWarsDyeJob for fashion submitions
---
Reaper's  Hood maybe most overused necro skin to date.
---
I have another issue that when holding right mouse and moving to bottom left and scroll, the chat scrolls instead of zooming in and out. Same thing happens with minimap when moving to other side. When releasing the mouse the pointer is at the original location.
---
Yeah, but changing PVE balance doesn't mean WvW/PvE balance has to change. They've been seperated for a long while now.
---
This has been bugged since PoF release. I remember encountering it on my first play through of desolation and we all laughed that it was brand new, of course it fucked up.
---
Really I think Anet has always under-prioritized bugs and modifications to existing content. They really like NEW stuff. New maps, new quests. Not so much a fan of repairing broken things, unless they interfere with something new. (I'm thinking of the inquest lab in Malchor's that got fixed after like 5 years when suddenly a new quest needed it).
---
longbow was useless since day1 ,very bad skill design expecially for True Shot and Hunter's Ward, and it was always bnerfed in pve also without a proper redesign of his problem...
---
What abilities do at the core is consistent between modes. It's number tweaking, not effect tweaking, that changes between modes. And that is what I was saying, so I don't know what you're trying at.
---
I really hope one day this can be used efficiently in T4s
---
It was pretty damn great in pvp for a while actually.
---
Being gay isn't a disease under any medical or psychological criteria. 
---
But you know what? Even when treating people with serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia, you still need to LISTEN TO THE PATIENT. When trans people tell you their gender dysphoria is much better after transitioning, fucking listen to them instead of trying to act like you know what's best for them. You would never tell a schizophrenic who says a certain medication is working well for them that they should stop taking it because you don't personally approve of it. What am I saying, you probably WOULD do that.
---
LGBT people don't need your help "getting along in society." Being gay doesn't fucking disable me. I can function in society without any problems, the only problems come from bigots like you. And even with people like you constantly wishing I didn't exist, I STILL "get along in society" no thanks to you. So kindly fuck off with your band of "help." I neither need or want your "help." Your "help" would probably result in my life being torn apart.
---
No one cares that you want to shield your kids from reality. Your kids probably don't give a shit. It's not our responsibility to make sure your kid learns to be a homophobic piece of shit like his dad.
---
Kids have no problem understanding gay relationships, usually. Convincing them to hate LGBT people is what's hard. That's why you don't want your kids "exposed" to them, you don't want them to learn they're humans just like everyone else, you want to drill fear and hate into them first.
---
It's like saying interracial couples shouldn't hold hands in public because it might offend racists who don't want their kids to see it because they want to raise their kid to be racist. You're no different. 
---
Go play a different game if you hate us so much, there's more LGBT characters in this game than most others, so shouldn't you be boycotting it or something? Just go away.
---
Conservatives hate us because we defy gender and sexuality norms, not because we do pride parades every now and again. Get your head out of your ass. 
---
My existence is a fact of reality. It's not an "ideology war."
---
I am playing through S3 story for the first time, and just arrived on the "Winter Berry" Map.  I heard this was a good place to collect stuff and make gold.  From the berries are people opening the berries for the magic or keeping them?  Also I see a ton of chests are they worth looting every day, and are they using keys to open, or just locked in the ice?  Also I feel I am getting through the episodes pretty quick, but struggling to level up the masteries.  Is there a way to boost leveling of HoT masteries?  I do have the raptor mount.  I feel if I was walking through the maps I would be killing (and dying) more mobs, but with the mounts you can skip through some regions pretty quick.
---
Why are those things mutually exclusive? Why can't we have a fun pride parade and ALSO treat people well all-year?
---
Pride wouldn't exist in the first place if straight people didn't single us out and raid gay bars and beat the shit out of us, so blame yourselves instead of us.
---
Completely understandable, its one of the reasons I have always steered clear of raids. It is something that works well for me and my usual party ( with builds being secondary to preferred play) but not so great pugging raids. Thank you for the response and best of luck this weekend!
---
I know you didn’t claim it, but you also didn’t not claim it so I thought I would just point it out. Either way, I still like your analysis :)
---
I mean they still haven't implemented a remake of season 1 so they're pretty much pretending it doesn't exist, then might as well put old LA back since s1 never happened &gt;.&gt;
---
I steal designs, looks and names from gatcha mobile games that I play.
---
&gt; I love how gw2 players still live under this illusion that the game is even remotely hard
---
I never claimed it was hard, I also don't think it's braindead easy.
---
Not everything has to be an extreme, it rarely is tbh.
---
Meh, it originally was only in LA, and tixx lives in a giant flying balloon anyway so him moving around isnt too crazy.
---
Apparently, you have no idea about polls and their analysis. I just hand them braincells back, you seem to need them.
---
Heal scourge in fractals is amazing. Can carry a whole bunch of bad people. Got tired of failing over and over with the condi scourge and swapped over another light set I had to the marshals/shaman version and it's so much better. My dps is meh ok but I can survive like no one's business. As long as I am up, the group is too. I love it!
---
Scrapper, cause i already tried playing all the supports and still can't find one that combines fun with friends and fun with "wtf are you doing sitting in a puddle of fire?".  
---
Playing scrapper now cause i can't decide.
---
True. But then again, Anet should just simply split the skills between PvE and PvP/WvW like they did with others. It's the best thing they can do anyway.
---
Oh boy that Grasping "Dread" chest piece.
---
Looks great, still!
---
You might *feel* like longbow is good because you're killing mobs that die regardless of what weapon you're using though. Testing guardian's longbow along with every other weapon shows strictly worse autoattack damage, which is a very huge factor in determining whether or not the weapon is worth using. Also every other one of its skills are slow with mediocre damage coefficients and high cooldowns, it's just pointless to use honestly. The only time I have found a use for it is to take down the last risen cannon in Arah p4 which is an inanimate object surrounded by risen grubs, and I don't want to risk aggroing them so I just afk and tap 1 to autoattack it. I can't find a single situation ingame where it is useful outside of that over any other weapon.
---
Without any knowledge to how long you've played Guild Wars as a franchise I can tell you that at release, and with no elite specs catering to other classes ridiculous movement utilities and much less condi clear in the game, landing this combo would put the core thief in a VERY favorable position in a duel. It was the only splash blind option they had without being forced to take shadow arts as a traitline.
---
Good players do this because they actually line up their skills, know the radii, and instacast. Good thief players also know the radius to [Cloaked in Shadow](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cloaked_in_Shadow) so they can splash blinds onto their opponents from stealth. Sadly, stealth reveal makes this entirely pointless as well as items like the target painter in WvW.
---
Vet thief players do this because there's a huge benefit to learning high-skill playstyles for the thief. Shadow arts is really the crutch for this class because applying blinds to enemies is what gives the thief a window for attack. If you started playing only after daredevil was released than it would make more sense as to why you feel that way, but I'm sad to inform you that's just not how it used to be.
---
Thief was originally boonstrip, stealth, condi clear and blinds. Not the infinite dodge, infinite I-frame, jump all over your opponent "lul im a brawler 2 guize" meta it's turned into. This game now rewards pressing one button and getting 3 different effects on top of high damage or a huge stun and doesn't reward high-risk play like it previously did. What I mean by this is anet turned the game into a brawler like LoL did post J4 release. All of the elite specs make this game much more rewarding to choose a build and playstyle that lets you spam evades and just clear everything applied at the beginning of a fight. Then just auto attack the opponent once both players have wasted all their cooldowns.  The game is no longer balanced around who saves their important burst for a favorable moment in the fight. It favors whomever slams as many numbers onto their opponent first with biggest-dick AoE rings being the deciding factor of what classes hold the meta. There's a reason Holo and SB have the de-facto Pvp builds it is, or why S/D thief is the preferred pvp build over other core builds.
---
I'll focus on engineer and ranger because they are the most difficult of the classes to beat as a thief. Both of them have ranged damage or utility that lets them kite or aggro a thief while still having insane sustain and boon generation saved for close quarters. They aren't impossible to beat, but the sheer amount of utility either of them brings to a fight paired with the actual animations and cast times puts thief at a clear disadvantage in these duels.
---
This game over-rewards tanky brawlers, boon spam, AoECC Spam, and instantly punishes builds that aren't built around oversustain or CC spam in a fight. Most core thieves, at least the half decent ones, will stick to shortbow and clusterbomb to deal damage because it's the safest option if they can manage to keep a gap built but the only fights you see of a core thief against other brawler elite specs are fights where the opponent sucks. Most fights a thief meets someone who will  Having three stunbreaks a thief is unnecessary but nice when other classes [have a 100% crit chance on their AoE stun skills](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Holographic_Shockwave) meaning they build tanky and stack ferocity. This completely defeats the purpose of landing a stun and then a burst if you first manage to land that stun. And makes it too forgiving for the players who miss that stun. It also means a class like holosmith doesn't have to line anything up they just run to the middle of an area and press the win button. 
---
You may argue that thief also has [100% crit chance tanky builds available](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hidden_Killer) and [if you ignore the fact a player needs to stealth first](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Detection_Pulse) before [using this trait](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Analyze) without being [revealed](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Revealed) from [1,200 range or less](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/%22Sic_%27Em!%22), you might be correct with that assumption. The sad reality is it's not viable with a thief health pool to build toughness, and putting points into vitality, or even healing power, does not scale on a thief and is a waste of attribute points because you will nerf your heal skills severely. Also, if you spec into critical strikes prepare to lose all of the survival utility that makes thief viable for Pvp because Trickster is a requirement unless playing a trapper build, Deadly Arts brings too much cheap damage to the table to ignore, and the choice between Acrobatics and Shadow Arts as a survival utility is completely up to the player preference, but not choosing one of these two as a core Pvp thief will severely decrease ones survival time.
---
If you think it is a waste of initiative to land that blind, and consider yourself a "serious" thief player, I can tell you that either: 1) You play staff daredevil and won't win a PvP fight without I-frames 2) you're playing deadeye and you rely on [Shadow Meld](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shadow_Meld) to carry your fights in PvP or 3) started playing more recently and never learned the different early builds for thief nor have you mastered all of the weapon skills.
---
tl;dr It only seems like a waste because anet overbuffed the elite specs, and I firmly believe you don't know what you're talking about.
---
Just a quick note about the Happy Raider's Kit: I'm aware it is currently slightly outdated due to the release of the new wing. The sections about compositions and rewards need to be reviewed, and I'm working on it. So in case someone complains about it, just letting you guys know it'll be changed.
---
....if anet is not losing money/gems on a bug/feature, they WILL NOT fix it...
---
I mean Sick Em at 40% damage increase, might need a looking at LOL
---
I start with names, which is usually the hardest part. Naming things is something I always take very seriously and enjoy doing very much. I'll spend literal _days_ thinking about it before coming to a decision.  
---
Once I have a name, which usually has a meaning behind it, I'll try to theme the character and their lore ( I enjoy writing stories for my characters as well, though I'm not an RP'er ) around that meaning.  
---
Where I get names can vary greatly. I might hear a name I like somewhere, I could go on a search for one I like based on certain meanings ( eg. Google; names meaning wolf ) or look for names specifically from certain cultures/ethnicities like Greek, Chinese, Norwegian, etc.  
---
Making a theme for my character is a combination of inspiration from the culture of where the name originates, the theme of the profession in game and the meaning of the name itself.  
---
The best example I can give is my Ranger, "Tsula Amayi" which means "fox in the water" in Cherokee. I thought as a Ranger, a native name would be suitable. I took her name and applied it to the Hylek language imagining she had been raised by them and discovered at a riverside as an infant. With reddish skin and being found in water, the Hylek named her accordingly in their own language.  
---
Ironically, my main character, my Necromancer, has a very meaningless name and one that doesn't suit her appearance at all. Initially her name had more meaning but, I changed it years ago because I wasn't happy with how it sounded. I thought I might change her name again but, it has now been almost 6 years and too many people recognize the name so, I've just left it as is.
---
&gt;are people opening the berries for the magic or keeping them?
---
Berries are usually gathered to buy ascended trinkets. But you'd need a combination of berries *and* unbound magic. 
---
If you're low on magic, you can just consume the berries. They're really quick to get, so it doesn't really matter if you consume a lot, since you can recoup what you consumed very fast.
---
&gt;ton of chests are they worth looting every day, and are they using keys to open, or just locked in the ice?
---
They have a chance for berries, so I'd assume that they're worth opening.
---
They don't use keys, but instead you use koda's flame that you can get from lit braziers of koda. It's limited use so you have to go back to a brazier once you use all your charges.
---
&gt; there a way to boost leveling of HoT masteries? 
---
If you find that you get Mastery points faster than experience, you can do Auric Basin's octovine meta and Dragon's stand map meta. From AB you get a couple hundred thousand if you get full participation, and for DS you can accrue a couple million if you do all events.
---
&gt;Before, there was never issue finding meta-group for HoT maps unless it was like 3-5 am.
---
I mean for VB (mat only) and AB sure. For TD and DS things in my experience are way different. If you are not early for TD you are pretty much screwed. As for DS I gotta say its like TD (not the most experience here) you gotta be early to get the squads going and ofc prime time is always the best time to find maps. Dont forget before they buff'd POF metas Hot was the only drop source of amalgamated gemstones.
---
Sounds like fun. Hope to see you guys there!
---
RMT items at not always deleted even when a suspension is issued often times the items themselves remain.
---
if its that big of a problem for you perhaps look for solutions you can apply? You can both ask for a improved feature and apply your own fix in the mean time.
---
Aesthetically they're fairly similar. The core spec lines are called Zeal, Radiance, Valor, Honor, and Virtues. They use heavy armor, and have a kind of "cleansing fire" aesthetic.
---
Their supportive builds provide a lot of defensive support as well. You'll have to make of that what you will, but compared to the other classes Guardians are definitely the closest if you're looking for the Paladin aesthetic.
---
Am I wrong about this.. Can't you mystic forge them for a chance at a different mini?
---
Everquest's AA system was first introduced in 2001, and has been expanded upon ever since. Its an extremely robust system, allowing for tremendous horizontal expansion for a character.
---
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/wiki/eq:AA
---
When ArenaNet first talked about the Mastery System, I was really hoping it would be more robust, interesting and diverse like it is in Everquest. Hopefully in the future they do more with the Mastery System. It has tremendous potential not yet actualized.
---
&gt; Is that a realistic thing to expect?
---
Depending on the encounter, group composition, and player skill level...yes.
---
Someone can probably correct me on the exact numbers. IIRC two support chronos doing their normal rotations should already generate about ~40% slow uptime just from shield4, WoA, and Time Warp. And that’s already a high enough uptime to make the Danger Time build better than the non-DT build.
---
If you’re concerned about slow uptime, you can take TW yourself for your elite skill instead of Grav Well (Grav Well is a very minimal dps increase) and use that to help with slow uptime and subsquad quickness. The other thing to watch for is that certain classes also apply slow. DH and druid are very common classes, and they both apply residual amounts of slow (DH elite; druid CA 5). Condi Rens are rare to see in pugs but output tons of slow - an average condi ren can keep up at least 80% slow uptime just by doing their normal rotation (two applications of shortbow4 per 20 seconds, at around 80% condi duration).
---
thematically, yes (sort off) it's not tied to a religion because of lore reasons and that's why it isn't just a paladin.
---
mechanically it depends on what game you're comparing it too
---
ArenaNet has all of that information.  We see development into raids based on that.
---
Earlier, raids got a lot of attention both because it was new and because the information was still being collected.
---
They have refined that having the data.  There are additional factors (like complexity and management) that go into decisions beyond population as well.
---
This same concept does not apply to WvW or SPvP.  Unlike other game modes, they do not require anything even coming close to new content.  It's mainly static with balance changes.  When changes in the way of new content are made to WvW, also, you usually end up with many of those players complaining about the content.  Note, big difference between new content and balance changes.  Desert map was new content, mounts, etc.  
---
And more substantial changes (again, not content) for WvW like alliances require a lot more work than most players really understand.  It's not like another raid or living story.  And for balance changes and such, again, you will always have many players who disagree with that too. 
---
For PvE, players may complain about the level of quality of new content, but they almost always welcome it.
---
And really, anybody who plays GW2 constantly will always complain that there is not enough content if that's what they seek.  You can't create faster than it's being consumed.  Your favorite TV show, book, game, etc. can't keep up with you if you insist on binging it.
---
Does not matter if it's raids, fractals, open world, WvW, SPvP, or other.  Best idea for those who have more playtime is to get additional games.  Just like you don't wait around waiting for the next episode of your show to be created and complaining, you watch other shows also and additional hobbies. 
---
Sorry, I know most of this is not factored in your simple query.  Just some thoughts of mine.
---
If you got enough gold to get 4-5 LW episodes, with Ep6 beeing now available for free, then you can get the whole Season 4 pack. Or you could wait for discounts maybe and farm Ep6 map meta for easy gold.
---
That's what did it for me too! The designers didn't just say "yep, they're plants" they went all out. Like "their bones are hardwood, their muscles are vines, sap courses through their veins and leaves make up their skin" that kind of character building really helps me connect to my character
---
isn't the gryphon just a mount that works like the HoT glider?
---
if it truly "flew" then there would be no need for the skyscale other than the aesthetic...
---
also for a new player 250g is a LOT and is way further away just due to the cost of leveling professions, buying/crafting gear etc. it will be a while before there is 250g that is "expendable" for an upgraded glider...
---
Masteries, particularly HoT masteries, are absolute crap. First, most people try and rush them either because they want to keep getting spirit shards or they want all the stuff right away. Second, many masteries are extremely boring. Oh boy, I can now run over a mushroom and move... slightly faster? Oh boy, now I can use generic vendors that should have been in the map regardless? Oh boy, now I can kill a special boss once for a collection and then never bother with it again? Oh boy, I can call on an exalted to ignore me while I die? Oh boy, now I don't die in arbitrary death zones put there purely to milk my time so I have to wait longer to get map complete on the expansion maps? Oh boy, I can now use ANOTHER set of generic vendors? OH BOY.
---
I could go on. There's a reason why they honed in on the glider mastery as a model for the PoF masteries. Because that was the only one that felt flavorful and fun consistently (except for maybe the go-invisible-when-you-dodge-while-gliding one, which was pretty niche). PoF masteries are a bit cookie-cutter, but still miles better than HoT. I think a lot of people have done them and got rose-tinted glasses for the HoT masteries, but if you really look at them (and their prices!!) you can see they're complete garbage.
---
lul no its not, its absolute bullshit - if you bring a Longbow people automatically assume you're trolling.
---
Damage is so low you might as well autohit afk on Greatsword and still have triple the dps. I wish I were kidding here, sadly I'm not! 
---
I really want to make use of Longbow skins, really want to use Pharus on my Guardian since its my Main but there is no reason to. Longbow needs like at least an 200% damage buff and some rework of skills 3, 4 and 5!
---
Having the option to kill or call back your minions in combat would be a good start for a role called minion "master".
---
I’m hesitant to add Delayed Reactions since it’s extremely unreliable :( - a lot of bosses simply don’t have channeled attacks that you can easily “interrupt” as a support chrono.
---
Along the same veins, since I frequently see people recommending it, Lost Time is a huge dps loss on your support chronos. It’s likely a bigger squadwide dps loss for them to take it than for the pchrono(s) to just have less slow uptime.
---
fair enough. if the gryphon isn't just an upgraded glider i *will* probably go for that one first, simply due to the current skin options possible. thanks for taking the time to increase my knowledge/understanding of in-game options/mechanics :-)
---
Make the minions have health decay like in GW1. Using your healing skill then heal your minions within a radius, but they'd eventually die.
---
And, like in GW1, you would only be able to summon a minion from a corpse.
---
We didn't hope, we knew how.
---
S3E3 and S4E6 are the best for gearing up Ascended accessories. They both have a gathering farm that is easy and plentiful that cover all the slots.
---
S4E6 is similar to Dragonfall where you escort to outposts, build out the outpost, and help with events there until you all meet up for the final boss.
---
Okay I need this song for my new alarm

Grasping boobs chest piece*
---
What's not impressive for you might be impressive for someone else. Different circumstances and premisses and such.
---
It's going to be an uphill battle. It has to compete first for DPS and then for utility. Scepter is not only more damage, but offer versatility and utility in bringing focus (blocks, RoJ and SoW are a *lot* of damage). Plus longbow's playstyle heavily encourages ranged gameplay, but there is no meta without stacking and scepter/focus excels in both long and short range. 
---
They could make it a good general PvE option with some buffs, but I think it has too much work cut out for it to become a meta replacement.
---
I would love a summons focused spec for Necromancer.  Fingers crossed for next expansion.
---
Guardians have Paladin elements to them. Guardians are inspired from the GW1 monk (holy support class that also acts as the antithesis to necromancers), ritualist (spirit conjurer), and dervish (warrior priest that builds up and tears down boons on themselves) professions. They have additional elements of blue fire, force fields, and heavy armor. I tell friends who aren't familiar with this IP that guardians are essentially defensive Jedi. At their core, they're the truest magic-martial hybrids of the game (even though every profession can be built like a hybrid) with an affinity for support.
---
It was meta when hot came out. Was actually way too strong for a long time, along with the traps.
---
And yet people sell it for less than the crafting cost 🤣😂😂😂
---
Someone else suggested making it a ranged control weapon. I could see that being useful in wvw or PvP.
---
As much as i do love the old LA way more then the new the thing is, there was a war. LA was destroyed in that war. The war was real and us the players played through it and it is one of my favorite parts of the game. Arena Net did not only dare to destroy LA, they also kept it destroyed for more then a year and we faced npc who cried for their dead and for their homes and we even collected gold to build it up agian. It all took time. Even the music was different and you felt the pain and the death.
---
Other games would have had the war and when it was over pressed the restore button and tadaa everything is the same again. Arena Net did not do that. They dared to destroy our main hub and then took the time to build it up again. I both love and hate the way they did it but i don't want to change it. It was one of the best moments this game had. The war and what lead up to it. It is so sad that so many never get to play it.

If you think your thread should be allowed to stay or if this was a mistake do report this comment or send a modmail and Pact commander will come take a look.
---
I think a more practical solution would be to simply make maps that are just harder than others. Tangled Depths used to fulfill this niche perfectly until nerfs and power creep.
---
Of course, consideration needs to be made so that casuals don't need to step in it. That way they don't complain.

This sounds super fun :D I'll be there.

---
&gt;Can you double-up ascended gear on the same character?
---
Even if its impossible by default, you can make one of rings only infused, while second could be infused or infused AND attuned. Thus they no longer the same unique item.
---
Every time I accidentally attack a boar and get a boar bristle when it dies I rage a bit.
---
dragon hunter good at killing dragons not people :) thats how anet wants it
---
Bitterfrost is the easiest to farm so buy all the available trinkets from there; the rest you get from the other maps.
---
For bloodstone, if you have several toons, you can do map completion for each one. Its quick and gives you ample supply of rubies
---
I like a mix of pure aesthetic and backstory. My gf and I have our own established canon for all our alts. My main is a sylvari mesmer, and I base her look off of delicate human weapons because her background is all tied up in human problems. So she switches between all cultural armor + human weapons like the rapier or sunspear stuff, and a more order of whispers-ish outfit depending on how I’m feeling lmao.
---
I also have a hard time breaking away from the profession colors... I try to stay close to them while still branching out a bit, like dressing my sylvari mes in warm pinks to stay close to the purple skills while still not looking too matchy matchy. And my necro has the black but I put it with warm autumn colors instead of green, because she’s a sylvari and I think she’d associate death more with the colors of dying foliage. It’s hard though. People who can veer away from the established “look” of their class always stand out to me.

You gotta put two \\ anytime you put one in an emoji, markdown on reddit uses the \\ character as a sign to ignore whatever formatting is right after it. So reddit sees one \\ as just an instruction and doesn't show it, you gotta add a second to tell it not to do so if you want the \\ to show up in your emoji.
---
No difficulty but it would take longer than getting all those 3 you mentionned.

Go warclaw only to prevent spoiler or if you like WvW since it has no competitive advantage over PvE mount.

sorry for being abrasive but it was pretty clear you're not very willing to be informed, you just reaffirm yourself everytime instead of considering you might've been incorrect. zhaitan flooded LA. ruins of it were used by corsairs. Cobiah Marriner fought the risen navy that harassed krytan ports, and after that he rebuilt LA, founded lionguard, made it a proper city and lived happily ever after, end of book
---
Yes, better buy it fast before prices normalize.
---
Gw1 warrior feet, WoW warlock T3 helmet and WoW rogue T3 chest— pretty cool! stinks it’s an outfit though
---
Ranged weapons in PvE are just really bad overall. It makes sense why from a PvP/WvW point of view, but many (if not most) 900-1200 range weapon skills are just bad. It will take a great deal of effort/changes from the balance team to create a skill split that will make most ranged weapons PvE usable while keeping PvP power in check.
---
I have the luck of being a writer and serious role player already, so I end up making characters that I already have in my head. Though, sometimes I’m inspired to make somebody new; my most recent alt, Valenextran, is somebody new to my personal character roster. The other advantage I have is using my characters to help explore issues I already deal with, like isolation and bearing secrets. Vale’s Dream was to protect a powerful Bloodstone artifact, a task that isolates him from his fellow sylvari and begins corrupting him as time goes on. So I end up getting to play with all kinds of fun mechanics and ideas.
---
So to answer your question...start with a character. Somebody with a story. It could be anything! And then play around and let ideas come to you. I know more about Vale now than I did when I made him. And that’s helped to inspire much of his design and backstory.
---
Many people really like the simple, "boring" skins you know?

Is there actually any boss in raid where you can actually precast? Except maybe Matthias?

I think you mean "killing people, not dragons".
---
An elite spec
---
Any attempt to fix the current version would probably render it extremely annoying to play against in PvP because there's not much control over them. If you want to add proper control then it will need to be an elite spec.
---
Reddit: We need less flashy skins and more simple skins!
---
Also Reddit: Why is Anet releasing boring simple skins?
---
hmmm why Ascalonian? 🤔 Possible hint for new Ascalonian content? Or is it just me being overly hopeful after finishing reading Ghosts of Ascalon this week?

&gt;You wrote a lie, because you missread the wiki.

---
&gt;lie 
---
&gt;to say or write something that is not truein order to deceive someone.
---
So you think that, not only am I wrong, but I know I am wrong and my intent is to deceive you? I might be missinformed, but a liar?
---
&gt;I reference the book.
---
You referenced an *entire* book, if anyone wants to check if you are right they will need to read the entire book. Propper referencing would include what section, chapter or page the stated information is to be found.
---
&gt;I can prove that I am not lying...
---
While I don't think you are lying, the fact that you own the book does not prove that you have read the book. I too own the book, however, I have yet to read it.
---
&gt;I don't apeal to authority, I apeal to the books content.
---
Yet you don't cite the book, provide quotes or reference passages. Your arguments structure relies on your authority as a person that have read the book and thus have the correct understanding. In other words, I have to trust your interpretation and representation of what the book is about, not the book itself.
---
&gt;... but it wad pretty clear that you did not want to informed, you just reaffirm yourself every time instead of considering you might be incorrect.
---
You did not make a case for your points, instead you asserted that I:
---
1. Missunderstood what I read.
---
2. Can't read.
---
3. Am lying.
---
Which of these points invoke a sense of inquiery to you? To me your statements seemed baseless and rude.
---
In the end, did you convince me you are right? Not really, no. 
---
Am I sure I was right? No. Additionally you made me want to read the book to see if your interpretation is correct.
---
Caithe was an immensely bad decision-maker all the way through the personal story, and LWS1, into HoT.
---
Her constant defense of Folain, her subterfuge regarding Destiny's Edge, her theft of Aurene's egg.
---
The commander being so-done with her shit was actually one of the few story decisions that reflected my opinion directly.
---
That said, she got her shit together.  I wouldn't say enough to warrant a shoehorned group of devoted followers (looking at you, Crystal Bloom), but she's trying.
---
Thanks boss, we'll see how we go next week, I think at least one or two people are swapping to rifle deadeye so this could work out better.
---
Agree with this, hehe.
---
So... the Legionnaire Sword, but transparent? I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm all for weapons you can get/craft through gameplay/content rather than gem store, but I'd expect at least an original skin. Not something mindblowing, not something with flashy effects or anything. Just... something that isn't already in the game.
---
Can confirm. I actually saw candy cane nodes bugging out visually in Queensdale as well.

Unless they're cheeky and take signet of the hunt as well to be completely unblockable.

Worth mentioning that while paladins in other games tend to be very durable, GW2 guardians have the lowest HP in the game. You get a lot of defensive tools but can eat shit extremely quickly if you aren't using them properly. Something like a warrior or necromancer is a lot more naturally sturdy.

It really isn't.  Play glass, get shattered.
---
Oof ouch owie
---
Alas, his mistake was that we were not one. We were ten.
---
Getting the body/face/hair to look right is relatively easy, provided you don't need to purchase a specific color or style of hair to do so.
---
After that you just preview to your heart's content!
---
Please tell this completely trash junkrat/engie main all of your secrets
---
Well, the Charr didn't go ghost, nobody knows what happened to them. Did they suffer a fate worse than the humans, who eternally walk in fear and anguish, reliving their own deaths over and over? Perhaps we will never know.
---
Thanks for the answers y’all.
---
We should stop mentioning the lay off a already.
---
Let's concentrate on the positives they are putting into the game lately.
---
Except for the stupid map currency farms. I hate those.
---
setting hotkeys is your friend
---
I'm pretty new to knowing off the top of my head what different classes offer to each other, but if you can keep fury up full time, that affords you about 420 points of precision that you can then "spend" on other things, in this case perhaps expertise.
---
6x rune of the citadel increases fury's duration by 50% so that helps a lot if you want to go that route.
---
I think the only non-unique ascended items are weapons. Pretty sure all ascended rings and accessories are unique. 
---
Back pieces, amulets and armor might be, but it's not like uniqueness matters for those slots.
---
Nah it makes me sweat......... yeah I meant paltry.....
---
Go to the option and set your hotkeys I have Shift+1-7 for my mounts.
---
not every one has linked his account to efficiency, raids are far from dead content and people are even doing raids now  more than ever
---
&gt;Is there a trick to it other than manually clicking that tiny little arrow and choosing a mount there?
---
Other people mentioned setting keybinds(my favorite) and gw2radial. But also anything with that arrow, like utility skills, you can right click the full size icon rather than left clicking the tiny arrow.
---
That's the funny part, because how couldn't you.
---
Well this method is pretty op for afk Farming. Just draw your weapon and ur Good to go. Spamming 4 is sadly still possible and should be banned imo.
---
Yessss, I love this song!
---
Yeah I'd agree with your thoughts, I definitely don't fully grasp what is too strong in PvP, especially when it comes to CC.
---
Cantha :((

---
Hotkeys are nice for mounts but you can also right click the mount icon instead of hitting the tiny arrow. The same works for changing your utility skills.
---
The only place we didn't really get to re-see would be the Marga Coast. Maybe a little bit more info about Dzalana or actually getting to explore the Realm of Torment would have been cool. I would have also liked if that unused portal in Fields of Ruin had been used somehow. It also would have been nice to get any more information about what the hell Razah was.  Also, anything about Arachnia or the Joko vs Thorn conflict would have been sweet. 
---
I actually really had to wrack my brain for anything to mention! I think Anet did a really thorough job with PoF+LWS4 content. The mounts, especially, are awesome! Honestly, my biggest complaint concerning lore would have to be the inexplicable gender swap of the Giant Fallen Warrior Statue.
---
&gt; Also, the Charr were present during the Foefire event that caused both humans and Charr to go ghost and die.
---
But wasn't the ghost form tied to the curse Adelbern inflicted upon his deserting soldiers and affected therefore only humans? As far as I know, there are no ghostly Charr in Ascalon at all.
---
You can just do low level content on your lv 80 rev. It's one of the classes with somewhat poor core spec performance, but works great with elite specs.
---
I choose alts based on content so my alts are only there for certain raid bosses where my main class doesnt shine. Everywhere else I play my main. Other people probably have different strategy.
---
Of course, and I have no strong opinion either way on reskins. I was just pointing out that people can want more "boring simple skins" without wanting reskins.
---
completion rate as in kills / pulls?
---
Percentage of accounts that have a successful kill.
---
&gt; ~~2 weeks~~ 9 months later we got raid.
---
i think using a bar graph instead of a line would have shown the data better.
---
Nerf everything else down instead. There is already too much powercreep in the game.
---
I stopped raiding a few months before w5, qT stopped even before that. I wouldnt be surprised if people simply got bored of raids or didnt want to bother doing them after getting legy armor.
