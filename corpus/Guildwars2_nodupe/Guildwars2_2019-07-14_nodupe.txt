Yesterday I participated and used skill 3 during  brand crystal event, but then the tool got deactivated, so I needed to activate it again. 
---

---
Result: I got only 5x purple bullshit items for spending 5 minutes of my life time.
---
---
---
Haunted Armor Outfit is on store now :)
---
I had some wvw pots and repeated istan track for about 800 kralks ore. If you have some pots go this way.
---
&gt; There IS loot in that brandstone, it is being added to your personal loot list as you mine it,
---
I assume that's the stuff you get once the brandstone is destroyed and everyone hugs the supposed middle point.
---
Wtf did I just read?
---
Exactly.
---
Hope you like Hanzo mains...
---
Where do you think I got that "Inquest Overseer Chair" from?
---
For Vision, you can also skip some of the map meta achievements that way - specifically those which require the Corsair armour piece.
---
Agreed, my average skilled reaper friend is dominating in fracs for a while now.
---
CHARR! Because they are very charrming
---
Anyone who thinks shroud is a second health bar hasn't played necro since launch
---
That’s impossible! You didn’t see the core because
---
#IT’S NOT THERE.
---
&gt; but then the tool got deactivated,
---
The tool self-deactivating is yet another of the event annoyances.
---
&gt;If you couldn’t grasp that before
---
My boi we’re talking about **NEW** players, there isn’t a ”before” for them.
---
Just use LFG to find HP trains. So easy in a group.
---
Big mob? Go the opposite way. There will likely be another point, it’s just further away. This will let you get gold participation every time.

Ignore the salty comments and enjoy the game! Also if you need any tips or want to get into dungeons or fractals later pm me and I could break it down for you if you are interested. Lastly I'm glad you are enjoying the game as f2p as I played 300 hours as f2p before I bought the game, there is a ton to do with the core content!
---
The heart of thorns story has been gutted to pieces because it apparently was too long and complicated, instead of fixing or expanding Anet decided to ignore it and move on to something else (path of fire)
---
You can salvage the Ascended drops for 60 shards each and sell the minis for 40 shards each. Use those to buy the infusion for 1k shards.
---
Thanks, these were not the comments I was quite expecting but thanks again.
---
I was about to remove the community part, though-
---
PoF expansion expires end of this month, unsure about dragon outfit
---
I personally like to jump around mistlock sanctuary as a snowy pine tree.
---
My ascended guide for a new player would be; 
---
First set should 99% of the time be zerker.
---
* get ascended trinkets with laurels and accessories with guild commendations
---
* fill the trinkets with agony so you can do T1, T2 and possibly T3 fractals
---
* you will get ascended drops from your dailies, stat swap these if necessary
---
* use fractal pages to purchase stat selectable ascended equipment to fill in the gaps
---
Other than a link to the wiki version of the notes, the top two threads in the balance patch conversation were Necro and Mesmer complaints. It's clockwork.
---
And how exactly can a RBMK explode, explain that.
---
It's as if you went for an x-ray.
---
I'm just salty about the d/p daredevil nerfs. d/p was already underpowered.
---
Nightfall Beyond would be a godsend not just for the content, but because it would be a breakthrough in GW1 building. Right now we still get occasional QoL improvements thanks to two devs who spend their extra time on the game, but they can't do anything involving art assets. If NF beyond was done it would mean we could probably get the scheduled-but-never-delivered Ranger, Paragon, and Smiting Prayer reworks.
---
Credit goes to /u/SrGrafo he makes wonderful comics
---
It’s a good question, and also, is Kryta still ruled by a monarchist dictatorship? Has Queen Jennah ever reinstalled the Ministry after the fall of the White Mantle or is she just a dictator forever now?
---
So many plot threads that are just forgotten.
---
Some parents get their kids swim lessons, others yeet them into a pool and yell “swim!”
---
Yeah, an up-to-date character will still see the Pale Tree is recovering from the Shadow of the Dragon attack. This means she's been affected by the attack for approximately five years.
---
The *only* way I can see this being canonically justified is if we have a story arc involving healing the Pale Tree from some vicious kind of toxin that Mordremoth left in her. Maybe something that poisons the Dream as well as her physical form. It would be a great platform for exploring the state of Sylvari culture and tying up loose ends there.
---
Shield has been made baseline to Mesmer.
---
Dual Daggers are now the Chronomancer's weapons.
---
I played the charr male, and honestly I didn't notice the change of voice actor, but I didnt play hot/episode 3
---
Just base game, living story 1/2 and PoF
---
The human male has the same issue of the jedi consular/jedi guardian it is a completely fabricated characterless voice.
---
It is as though they were told to erase any real-world accent or meaningful inflection.
---
The sith characters and sylvari with their evil english accents (im american btw) great!
---
The human male and jedi characters, that ain't an american accent from any part of america I know, it isn't british, it doesn't fit with any fantasy setting I imagine. None of the star wars film characters sounded like that.
---
Similar to how News anchors/old timey actors sound
---
Close but not quite right, he wanted to post this image AND brag about having a wife ! Two birds with one stone.
---
Anet powercrept the game and nerfed dungeon rewards into Oblivion, then did nothing else, they probably did that to lure more hardcore players into the newer content, raids, and fractals.
---
Raids are being released once per year( every 8-10 months), fractals idk what the cadence is, but the newer ones are complete trash, and the lack of CMs make them even worse.
---
Idk who to blame but Anet, they could've kept releasing new dungeons and fractals and saying, raids aren't meant to be on gw2, and probably the majority of the community would be fine with it.
---
This seems like anet changing their way of thinking, probably because they realized that releasing a 2h story every 3 months and a big empty map was enough to make enough profit and cater to the majority of the community, and honestly they are correct, the game is doing OK and it will continue like that if they maintain this format, but this is no longer the gw2 that promised to be THE MMO, not just some Asian cash grab or a western early access BS, they aren't trying to improve their game anymore, and for that I'm kinda sad, because I'm no longer playing gw2 because I can't wait for the new raid and I need to prepared or w/e, I literally only play because I made friends during my time playing, and enjoying gw2 with them is the only way to get me to log in, or trying to learn/perfect more classes so we can try new strategies/speed up our clear times.
---
were talking about raids right? phase ends in let's say 12 seconds - no matter what you do youll only get out one more shroud - so delay and have that damage
---
also while you are in shroud you cannot lose scholar? why should reaper be gifted this benefit if it doesnt have any drawback
---
I see. I guess that would be something to consider. Is there anything else in particular that might also be important to look out for?
---
I think you have to have participated in the fight and dealt enough damage but also not died
---
Depends on what you're both playing really. In the cases of playing the higher tiered DPSs, you're not going to be one shotting but most things won't survive more than two or three hits if they aren't veteran or higher. That being said, pve isn't really difficult in the early game so they likely wouldn't notice the discrepancy in power until around 40 or 50, if they notice it at all.

For the kill, you get an item, you need to double clicl to unlock the armor collection and mastery track
---
Toss in the Nightmare Court too, we could use some lore on what's up on their side after the whole Faolain-Mordremoth thing.
---
We should quit mocking them and let Darwin do his thing.  
---
Even if they don't mow them down by their dozens (cause like 5 people might actually show up), I suspect they will find aliens who will be more than happy to demonstrate their anal probing devices, techniques and theories.

---
Why would the Ministry be reinstalled?  As an entity, it's very young, an attempt by the nobles to seize power from the throne initiated when Queen Jennah was a child and a regent was ruling Kryta on her behalf.  And given how that turned out, with the White Mantle making up a sizable chunk of the Ministry and trying to usurp power, I don't know why you think they'd immediately turn around and give them power back.
---
Kryta has been a monarchy for centuries.  That doesn't make it a dictatorship.  A monarchy is as good as its king or queen is, so it sucks to be a Krytan when Oswald is the ruler, but when someone like Salma or Jennah is the ruler, then things are good.
---
S5 really needs to be about tying up dangling plot threads.
---
Raiders academy is also almost dead. I've been playing for 3-4 days (~10 hour sessions) and very little goes on. It's the best starting point, but look for a raiding guild in the meantime.
---
You want me to help you complete dungeons? 
---
I'm in. Just let me know.
---
24 silver doesn’t sound like anything to complain about tbh. Don’t like to grind meteors? Use the TP.
---
the current dash is already short. any shorter and it is close to useless
---
The point is more that the content is doable with just auto attacks than that all people use is auto attacks. The fact that auto attacks can complete the entire story, and thus, that *actual skill buttons* just completely destroy and melt anything, is silly in a lot of people’s eyes.
---
Reaper doesn't do nearly as much damage as the other power classes and this is because it trades that potential damage for being more survivable.
---

Because most of the people streaming are people invested enough to be playing modes that have more than 2 hours of content every 4 months...
---
Also Zorric would like to have a word.
---
It's pretty useful on the ground. A small jump and dash can get me around pretty quick.
---
Timegated with nearly zero bugs in the maze and no bugs on the events.  It has two very clear metas and a finish line for the daily.  Kralkite is just constantly farm and pray the events don't bug out like in the image.
---
The idea is simple: tagging all the Events and still got time to kill All Mobs on the way. The loot from cleaning the areas is Not to undererstimate. 
---
This sheets shold bring some New ideas for Our daily farm...  Also i will try New things
---
I doubt any of the discussion in here is about PvP.
---
I think there should be a note that says, "Can't be done with just three players on the map."
---
^ How I spent my Saturday morning.
---
If there were 5 episodes, and each one was 10 usd, who would care
---
Yes. But the benefit is I don't need to switch between mount. And considering how many things have a form of long range attack it's just better if I never have to switch.
---
Yeah. It’s taken a long time and I expect it’ll take more time still. The latest update on their work was allowing all EU servers to link, regardless of language. Which was, to say the least, am interesting and controversial decision.
---
I thought of "Norn guardian main and his friends new asura"
---
Yeah, I read that.  It sucks, but what can ya do?  TBH, I still believe the problem isn't that trait healing while in shroud, but rather the amount of damage multipliers that can be stacked for being in shroud.  5% of 20k auto attacks that finish in a second is 1,000 hp a strike.  Having 100% crit chance with 40% extra crit damage and two 10% modifiers while in shroud while full glass is the problem.
---
I have a laptop with similar specs and I get on average 10-15 fps in towns with lots of players, ~30 fps otherwise. Lowest settings, 1024x768 res I think. 
---
In short, I don't think it's an enjoyable experience but you can dl the game fo free and try it out yourself.
---
The game lists dates in the Story panel.  The game's time is tied to real time.

The Personal Story occurs in 1325 AE (2012 AD), and the game is currently in 1332 AE (2019 AD).
---
Astral isn’t much of a grind at all? I just casually did it over the course of a week, didn’t feel that bad. The only thing I found annoying was the daily time gate, but even that wasn’t a huge issue because I was gathering ore periodically.
---
It will still heal outside of shroud, and reaper does a ton of damage outside of shroud too.  Between the passive healing from the group and this, it's still going to be easy to regain lost hp.
---
&gt;i don' have hot 
---
The very first words in OP's post...
---
[this is my language file](https://github.com/Snowy1794/TacO-Language-Chinese-simplified/blob/master/TacO_Language_cn.xml)
---
It's not losing the healing.  It's losing the ability to heal in shroud.
---
It is better than this.
---

---
Fans criticised it a lot for catering too much to sylvari. There was a lot of "enough with the sylvari already!". It also set an expectation that all the other races needed to have their moment, and this places unnecessary restrictions on the writing process.
---
Sounds pretty casual to me.
---
been there done that
---
Its a place where we study Aliens from space and stuff like that. We waiting for the big Economy crash to reveal Aliens to the masses to distract from economic depression.
---
Thanks for spoiling rhe monster in stranger things? I’d give you reddit gold if i could...
---
'Cause it's a bad class. It always has been a bad class. I have been advocating for the functional deletion of Chrono since like Salvation Pass.
---
Alacrity is a shit mechanic. Buffs in this game are no skill boring bullshit by necessity. Yet both of those things have so much power, and chrono is designed around them. So chrono is either OP as sin, or useless, and I gotta be honest with you, I literally don't think the second thing is a possibility. I don't think its possible to nerf chrono enough to get people to consider other options without literally removing personal damage from the class.
---
repost? this pic is already on front page
---
The CSS is fine, that's what it's for, just careful when updating your install.
---
Ask assnet.
---
The problem is, it doesn't scale well at *either* end of the spectrum:
---
- Part of a big group? Enjoy seeing mobs vanish in 5 seconds while you land 1 or 2 hits on one at most, if you're lucky.
---
- 1-3 people? Enjoy standing around chewing through more HP than some some elite mobs, getting absolutely zilch while you watch the "completed holoprojectors" counter tick up...
---
This leaves you with a sweet spot of maybe 5-8 people, able to clear in time but not absurdly quickly. But let's be honest: How often do you get just that many?
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure this is wrong.
---
Can you tell me what the problem is by looking at this? Not sure if it's missing characters in the font or bad utf8 decoding or what.
---
[removed]
---
so it's only for quartz and kralk ore? eeh, just get the home instance node, farm daily and forget about the whole situation for half a year. voila, you got 1500 of each.
---
Okay, cool. Yeah, I just redid those values in the new updated file and it seemed copacetic. Thanks for the info!
---
There's more. I think that new elites will be foreshadowed in upcoming story. If we will see any suspicious npc, any class with unusual weapon that would be it.
---
Are you on the European or NA servers?
---
I mean, if you relied on your F5 as a scrapper you were already doing something pretty wrong.   
---
Now you have AOE Downstate control , which in WvW is absolutely necessary. Currently downstate control is dominated by anything with free burst ( to cleave ) or Merciful Intervention ( The Guardian teleport ) , I don't see much else that can revive at range that's actually used .   
---
I know the warrior Elite banner does it, but no warrior will ever take that banner. especially since most warriors are spellbreaker and need that god-level fart cloud for guild fights.
---
What are the linked servers?

I've already tried and tested many times. At first I thought that it was caused by my translation file as it was including some letters like "şçöü" etc. and i thought that they're not completely supported so I've changed them with "scou" etc. but nothing changed. Even when I change the language back to english i'm still getting the same error. I've sended you the full crash.log via Reddit message. Thanks.

How...?
---
I just wish there was more content
---
I wonder if they could remodel whole crafting procedure of Astral/Stellar weaons on Dragonsblood and Heroic Dragonsblood; Thunderhead Peaks sets feel more accessible. Sure those require running around but if you visit that map and do stuff like meta and dailies, you're getting all stuff needed in crafting
---
There is actually. Meteorites stop giving loot around 750 ore. You get nothing then.
---
Smaller WvW servers are linked to larger ones so that they are combined on the same team. You can see the list of [current links here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World#Currently_linked_worlds) and in game you can hit b and hover over the server name to see if they are linked.
---
If they made Outnumbered what it should be it could help a ton with lopsided WvW matchups. Right now it gives random buffs that don't help or make sense. If they made it into a something that gives you +%dmg/+%dmg reduction then at least those players could fight back.
---
Wooooow
---
[Magic find](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magic_Find) affects what loot drops you get in the first place, not the gear you salvage. Here is my [take on salvaging](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Salvaging).
---
"kill me"
---
They do NOT reset at weekly reset
---
The home instance node gives an *atrociously* low amount of Kralkatite ore relative to the amount you need. You can forget about it for a whole year and still have nothing like the amount you need.
---
if you WvW in an organised fashion you know you important the reveal is. Without it fights between organised groups are going to be laughably dominated by those in stealth.
---
Heresy
---
Dude... Scrapper was the only one with 1200 range reveal....
---
i think it's a bug. happened to me at times xD
---
Which is enough to craft... 2 weapons.
---
Only logs in to raid nowadays.
---
looks like Heimdall
---
Given the "stuck in time" nature, it'd actually be mid-Season 3 we last heard of the Pale Tree, so it'd be 2.5-3 years.
---
&gt; it'll take time
---
You need 3000. At 3 ingots/day that's 1000 days.  In 2 years and 9 months you'll be done.
---
I do my wvw dailies, on weekends sometimes I run with a tag as well. Other times I’m commanding a post reset Triple Trouble wurm, or sometimes I join the zerg for EVOS slot. 
---
I’m also working on creating Nevermore. To that end, I try to go and do certain PoF and HoT meta events fairly often, as those give Amalgamated Gemstones, which I’ll be glad to have when the time comes. I’ve been kind of slacking on that lately, though.
---
Oh, and in WvW I’m very, very slowly working on getting my first set of legendary armor, and I’m also considering getting the legendary backpiece, although the armor is the main goal.
---
And when I’m not doing all that, I also farm LWS maps, mostly bitterfrost frontier, to get those ascended trinkets.
---
Sadly, I don’t have as much time to play as I’d like, so it’s all going pretty slowly.
---
Gonna be honest here. I didn't know they were borked. What exactly is the bug if you don't mind my asking? I got my Skyscale literally two days ago so I don't even have the mastery yet haha
---
wat
---
They reset pretty close. They're reset by evening Monday Pacific. Still 12+ hours before Dragon Bash goes away.
---
I'm glad your enjoying the game, that's great!
---
But I'm sorry, all I can see when I read a post like this is "please buy my stuff." And sure enough, without fail I get to the bottom of your post and see this
---
&gt;I will never get the expansions due to economic reasons as I can't afford it but the more I play the game, the more I come to like it and enjoy playing it and that's only the base core game.
---
There were also all these rift achivements in the general tab back at the releaseof the episode, and then they removed them before anyone could get the skyscale
---
Its more like that u use ur Glider on the Mount
---
Run GS as your 2nd weapon set and press 2 for clone xD I mean most of Pve allows you to create that 1 clone from sword 3. But i agree that shattering for condi cleanse is not gonna be as good anymore or well even worth taking but we have to wait and see.
---
Yes! When watching ST season 3 I kept thinking: it's a bloody karka!
---
Difference can be in the stream, as well as the model used, better accuracy from the printer... many things can be attributed to the cause.
---
Thank you for all your hard work
---
What did I wrong to have "hardcore world bosses" as an empty line in event tracker?

Also there is no chatter on some game needing that.

Try resizing the window if it's at the bottom. (Settings-&gt;window edit mode)
---
One more thing (actually not just one):-D
---
* For marker editor could you add an option to disable the minimal distance between 2 of the same marker?
---
* What would be also great is being able to have 2 different marker placers instead of one each with different key and same for routes, I would like to draw 2 or more routes at the same time:-D
---
* Another editor option what would allow only delete/edit markers in categories what are currently active and with that would be also cool sort of debug option what would show inactive markers semitransparent or something like that
---
* What about some feature to undo/redo recently place markers without standing on them? It would be huge help mid-air. 
---
* Also some kind of D-Pad what could manually adjust the position of the latest marker.
---
* And for trails some button what would use a position of the latest marker as the next point of the trail.:-)
---
Its not going to be garbage (I mean any more than it already is) but the people saying that its going to be harder to maintain Scholar bonus is right IMO. 
---
Of course there are a lot of people dramatizing the shit out of the nerf but thats all balance patches. I did it for Druid.
---
The point of ammo skills is to have more flexibility on that skill aswell as a lower cooldown.
---
Rocket boots is not an ammo skill because they expect you to use it back to back.
---
Shatter storm was garbage back to back outside of zerg fights. You would always want to generate more clones before casting second one.
---
It's not like it takes long to generate more clones either, So you can still use them back to back. You just have to dodge and use 1 skill.
---
As this is laptop, that is impossible to force run directly from the dGPU, unless my laptop support G-Sync. I already set the high performance as default run for GW2, though the problem still occurs only in DX12 mode. I have no other game in DX12 mode, so I can't vouch whether the problem is isolated only for GW2+d912pxy or all DX12 titles. But for other game in DX9 or DX11, it will run correctly utilizing the dGPU.
---
reaper shroud autos are better than gravedigger spamming tho, so we dont spam much
---
Ugh this started to sound like a feature request hoard at work :D I don't want to create an enterprise level marker editing environment where the editor functionality has more code than the actual point of the overlay. I get it, improvements would be nice, I'll think about easy to do but impactful stuff that would help.
---
you're a blessing for gw2, thanks so much for STILL pushing for more even though the results already were amazing!
---
The biggest problem for WvW is: Clones NEED a target. Without something to target they just shatter themselves instantly/don't appear at all. WvW has a quite low enemy density so in open fields your only targets are likely to be players or more specifically groups of players. But as said by the OP, clones and illusions can be killed almost instantly by those, creating a problematic situation for chronos.
---
OP wasn't talking about PvE.
---
They fixed it by removing related achievements so in time people will forget and noone will complain. Classic :)
---
Yeah I do agree. I loved the sylvari tailoring before. It's honestly a shame humans didn't get more of that with the Gods storyline in PoF but I guess they leant heavily on Kasmeer to portray more of that insight instead.
---
I know this as well ;D 
---
Problematic is only the fact that they die almost instantly, even casted through gs.
---
It's a very small window + performance issues / skill lag it's almost impossible to hit.
---
Had this happen to me on my raptor during the Hologram Stampede. Good fun.

I get that, but please write these texts in the chatbox. The chatbox uses the same font that TacO does and I want you to make sure that it can correctly display the text you want to write, and then show me in the chatbox what it looks like so I can do pixel by pixel comparisons. I don't know chinese and at these resolutions a single pixel out of place can mean something else for all I know. So chatbox text comparison please.
---
It looks infected by flesh eating bacteria. Other than that, good job!
---
I don'r think it's undoable, but what matters is the expectations of the players.
---
It's fine to want a class because it brings something special to the game -makes it feel special and impactful. If chronos screw up the rotation the lack of alacrity is felt much differently than might or quickness - rotations might not even be completed.
---
However, predominance to chrono i believe it's due to three things that they are sloooooowly fixing.
---
1) it does not overlap with other chronos. If some of the power budget of the chrono were dispensed as a trait choice that, for example, said "10 characters nearby gain 100 power if they have alacrity" then it would be a powerful trait that, however, isn't useful if picked by two chronos, so one of them has to pick a suboptimal trait. This hasn't been done already but depends on 2
---
2) have alternatives to alacrity application. Fire brigade is an example of this, applying quickness and alacrity as well while doing more dps at the price of taking 2 slots. This means that you might still want a chrono, but not too many.
---
3) they have to redefine the tank role. A requested role as a chrono can't be a tank as well. Chrono supports ins't broken, chronotank is. They have sorta made a step into this direction with the latest update by restricting distortion application, even if it's just a small part of it. 
---
It is fine if a specific content is better suited only some specializations than others - it's what define choiches and identity. But they must not be chocking every other choiche.
---
[Here's a new gw2taco.exe that has the utf-8 fix.](http://conspiracy.hu/temp/BoyC/taco/utf8fix/GW2TacO.exe) Should work better with the skin i gave you.
---
When you buy expansion for 50 bucks, it is not just Class specializations.  And expansion still coming either way, so adding another paywall is closing in on p2w.
---
nah they were still there when I got my skyscale. 
---
you just couldn’t do them, no progress was rewarded for doing any rift.
---
People like your friend should apply the same logic to any other media. Long books that hook you? Multi series TV shows? etc. etc.

Fastest symbol generation bar hammer, so healing output is not terrible.

I read it as 30% less evade uptime but you do the same damage in that time? 
---
Seems like just adding counter play to me, a double or triple dagger storm thief was very uninteractive.
---
Imagine logging into LA and seeing rabbits zooming in the sky
---
Well... That's saddening. Lol.
---
is there a direct link somewhere to the release version? still can't find the one with the installer.exe
---
What about this one?

Well, it was fun while it lasted, spamming unblockable when pet meld triggered out of dismount was hilarious =D
---
put some boosters and its less than 4h
---
Ayyyy party pooper
---
Great example for the awakened is Koss, who kind of managed to stay the same by hiding from Joko.
---
Also, there are awakened that chose to become one in order to serve Joko. None of the Risen chose serving Zhaitan, they were all forced to.
---
Feels smoother! Thanks for this :D
---
Yup. But it's late and I had a brain fart
---
Overall speedup in retrace profiling by terms of api overhead reduction:
---
v0.9.5a - 33,88%
---
v1 - 44.5%
---
v1.1 - 52.4%
---
I don't think the risen are mindless, some of those present in Siren's Landing show personality and will of their own.
---
Unlike the awakened, the strongest lieutenants among the risen seem to be able to control or influence other risen. It's some sort of chain of command among Zhaitan's minions, similar to Joko's to some point (except Joko didn't delegate). If you were to capture a risen and keep it away from those influences long enough, he'd probably regain his lost will. Of course, the ideal solution is to break those chains altogether, and free the unchained risen from any kind of influence they could be susceptible to.
---
Note that some of them could just go crazy upon realizing what they have become, or be far too damaged to survive on their own. We do know though that the spirits trapped inside corrupted dragon forms can be freed, we see this with the ghosts of the Orrian monarchy in Siren's Landing, and with one of the members of the Order of the Crystal Bloom in Dragonfall, who speaks about his time as a branded minion.
---
I would say this applies to all corrupted dragon minions. Personally, I would love to see some of these dragon minions take their own paths and forge their own destinies now that their supreme masters are gone. Let's meet some risen pirates going on their own business, that could be really fun.
---
I recently crafted my first one using the irradiated crystal you're given along the way.
---
I really don't know if I can face the prospect of building another astral weapon *and then building another irradiated vision crystal* for the stellar version.
---
The issue is about the ability to heal in shroud. Reapers use to get a lot of hate from healers due to our inability to receive healing whilst inside our main mechanic (which is most of the fight). A better nerf would be to remove the healing from Soul Eater when outside of shroud, but keep it when inside.
---
There was some sort of achievement too, but it was removed. Kinda sad, would have been very fun to wander the world hunting those rifts :(.
---
Not enough love for male Human. Most of the others sound bland but the VA sounds like he's having a good time.
---
Yeah, this is a mess. I bought all the quartz I needed long ago, and I don't plan on farming those stupid meteors ever again.
---
As for the kralkatite, I just get it through PvP and WvW, since none of the other reward tracks feel interesting anyway.
---
I really hope this can be used with GW2Hook in the future. It's the only thing stopping me from using it at the moment.
---
I'll be keeping an eye on this.
---
wow look at mister tough guy boss dude who won't take no "sass"
---
Can we ever expect it to be compatible with GW2Hook?
---
 I'm finding it hard to part with that beautiful MXAO/sharpening.
---
I heard the people in Cantha are experts in matters involving nature recovering and stuff. Maybe we could go there and fetch a doctor...
---
Awakened are a different type of minions than dragon minions
---
Well a counter-point to that would be that free sylvari are more like free Awakened than unchained Risen.
---
I've played this game sinse it came out. With 100% confidence I can say that necro players whine more than any others. Only when necros fully dominate the META have they not complained *(AS MUCH.)*
---
Necro has been the best class for the widest amount of content in the game for a long time and still is, but it is never enough. In vanilla Fearomancer was OP for a while, Reaper at HoT launch was OP, and Scourge at PoF launch was OP. All if those specs are still good but nothing short of complete META dominance is enough for these players.
---
DX12 have no fur. You will see same graphics as before.
---
please use the search function instead of asking a question that's been asked a billion times already
---
thanks in advance
---
Correction: You need 300 ingots (3000 ore). We're looking at 100 days here, so a little over 3 months.
---
Only reshade.
---
As long as you find a way to kill the clones any profession can do this.
---
Scepter / sword for mass clonegen
---
maps are "frozen in time" now to preserve the story elements taking place in them. Imagine doing HoT now with mordy dead. It wouldn't work so with maps not being personally instanced  like gw1 they freeze them instead which works fine when you are aware of this
---
On first lines of log.txt
---
I get that sorry for being unclear. I meant as of LS3's time, the Risen are no longer under Zhaitan's control, so why do they still act the same? But I did get some good explanations from other comments though.
---
Any chance you could look into depthbuffer "paththrough" for reshade? It's not properly getting picked up once d912pxy is running. (Tested with d912pxy 1.0 (+hotfix) &amp; reshade 4.3 and manually compiled newest edits) 
---
Thanks for all your work regardless :)
---
Creating your own is the definite fastest way. It's how most people started out at the beginning.
---
Maybe the Wardens have recovered from the Jade Wind by now.
---
I can run you thru W1 with my guild team dude
---
We should not make comparisons between dragon minions because they were all created differently. Zhaitan reanimated long long dead corpses whose souls departed long ago. Those more "fresh" behaved like they just had access to a bit of memory stored in still fresh but rotting brain. 
---
Sylvari, even compared to other mordrem, were grown fully from a tree that came from a seed. We don't even know if those seeds were made by Mordy or just corrupted by him. Sylvari are a Specie while risen, branded and other are not.
---
Taking other minions in consideration, Primo make them from fire and stone, Kralky crystallize living creatures and Jormy corrupts (let's forget about then getting new skills from dead dragons for now).
---
Also we know that Joko magic is totally different, also God magic is different.
---
i highly recomend you go for W3, if you only want to unlock the mastery, since escort is probably the easiest fight to do for new Players. You only need 1 Chrono with some amount of experience
---
Suggestions for wvw?
---
Double stats for overwhelmed server?
---
Also, I leeched some encounters on my alt (we low maned xera with him being afk without leyline) and even though I got the item for the legendary collection, I didn't hit Xera and thus did not get the mastery achievement
---
True but at least rangers are shitting barriers out their ass.
---
Hey man, I'm just a casual here so I'm not trying to be a know it all, but there are more classes that have long duration reflects. For example, Thief with Daggerstorm and Ranger with Axe 5. Maybe even scrapper. Spellbreaker dagger 5 has a short duration reflect so it's probably not feasible. What do you think?
---
Is being escorted enough to unlock though? I have heard you have to somewhat participate, or how does being escorted work?
---
There are some raid training communities that are solely dedicated to run / teach raids with / to beginners.
---
Some of them are guilds that expect you to dedicate your time to them, but some are open communities where you can simply join and leave without anyone keeping track
---
i am a necro since the start and approve this comic. Never satisfied, always complaining
---
Hmm, yeah, especially since nobody seems to give a shit about the LFG for raids. Only problem I am seeing is,  if nobody can coordinate it.
---
&gt; i think it should be a feature. xD
---
ftfy
---
I guess, I might have to look out for that.
---
You must be very young.
---
Which region are you playing in? EU? Na?
---
Idk, obviously I have never done any raid, and my knowledge of w1 is only of theoretical nature.
---
Just to add information, unid gear used to be affected by MF on opening as well but it is no longer the case (because they already are influenced by MF during drop phase). This comment is only about unid gear though
---
"Escort" is the name of one encounter in W3. Basically the squad has to escort an NPC - Hence the name.
---
But yeah, buying or leeching a kill (Meaning: You're simply in the instance when the boss dies, but didn't contribute at all) would be enough in theory
---
FadeNear and fadeFar **are** along the z axis. Of the camera. Anything not related to the camera will look messy. If you're thinking about making stuff farther away look more dim... Well, that's what the camera relative fade is for.
---
I agree that making the Outnumbered buff actually mean something would be a great idea. I think it should triple every single one of our stats. Just apply a global x3 modifier to anyone with the buff applied to everything, including WXP, reward track, and ticks. If one server is able to bring dozens or even hundreds of people to the fight, let the server that can only field a few dozen all *perform* as if they were three times as many people, and reward them for being willing to do that.
---
Make it so that a 15-person zerg had a real chance to meet a 50 person zerg head-to-head and walk away from it if they had the buff. This would let smaller servers have FUN playing the game. The only downside to the big servers is that they would no longer be able to farm bags all day long. Boo hoo. They would probably still win the match, but at least their opponents could have more fun too.
---
Well, the camera then:-) I know they are but for example, for mount trails, I use fade distance around 5000 which is fine for running forward but not necessary if there are other routes under or above, you can see the issue in Rata Sum with my map completion pack. I simply wanna keep fade for x and y at 5000 but z let's say 200?:-)
---
unchained beast will still lash out at you, while freed prisoner will not
---
Another suggestion: Low Pop Current Players in WvW = Maplimit for the Other servers in the matchup which will result in absurdly high queue times on overstacked servers-so players/guilds leave the overstacked servers and join low pop server to play WvW instead of waiting 6 hrs in queue.
---
Oh I like this explanation thanks
---
like most of cantha that was mostly an ugly borring city. both places that can stay away for some time, except they completly change them
---
You da real MVP, bro.
---
Thank you very much for everything you've done for this game.
---
I can't play it without this addon anymore.
---
Praise Joko
---
If you still struggle, pm me. We could take you with us without any insane requirements like in crossroads.
---
now consider doing all the weapons. I think it's something like 16k you need overall. I don't mind some of the grindier achievements. like chak weapons took me a while too, but that was peanuts (one meta a day for like 2 months or so, pretty casual) compared to the immense amount of farming you have to do here.
---
I'm pretty sure that staff 2 clone spawns either without target or when target is very far away. The problem with that is positioning.
---
I heard about qT's attempts back when epibounce was still a thing, extremely impressed by the fact you guys were able to bring this to a successful end. Nice job. The theorycrafting as well as execution that went into this is just insane.
---
No, it's not. 
---
There are some convenient tools in the gem store such as shared inventory slots, bank expansions, extra char slots etc. You can normally play the game without them.
---
I like that they add removal of movement impending skills. It makes up a bit for the loss of unblockable. We can still run signet of the hunt for big spikes and better condi removal with this change :) and while this is a huge nerf, cmon we had 4sec  of unblockable every 10 seconds or so, thats for more that most if not every other class in game.
---
MTX is only for content (living seasons, but even they can be unlocked for free when the episode is new), skins and convenience items and you can get all of them with in-game currency. Expansions are the only content that you have to pay for.
---
Oh... THAT bug again 😄
---
I wish there were more ideas of what we could do without ANet being involved, lol. We're pretty much depending on a single guy there to do all WvW stuff. Last I heard anyway. And he seems to spend more time with little balance crap that do not improve the game mode in any serious way like the Alliance thing they talked about almost 2 years ago.
---
Many things are questionable because some things do greatly enhance gameplay even if people write it off as “convenience”. Thing is, you should ask a question “what do i win if i pay”. You won’t have better gear nor have different skills if that’s your concern.
---
This change is not irrelevant on AoE that applies damage and cripple constantly over its duration lol. It definitely hits harder while covering almost a full node.
---
Once I hit level 80 im getting the expansion. I don't count those as MTX
---
Once I hit level 80 im getting the expansion. Nah expansion isn't p2w or MTX. I was just worried about the store front
---
There was some problems with autocompile, now release page have proper archive.
---
The season stuff is kinda a blur, but without a subscription model it seems fine to me. I was worried more about weapons, and skills
---
the game technically can be includes in the p2w definition, you can use real money to get BIS gear, but gear is capped at the same tier for 6 years now, and thats actually a feature of game, there is no vertical gear progression or gear progression at all. So its not pay 2 win.
---
I played the game for the first 4 years on a shitty pc. Lowest settings and we will see you in Tyria
---
The vast majority of dragon minions are made mindless as well as their free will being stripped. The only Unchained Risen (that we see) which have intelligence to differentiate friend and foe are the "Kingpins", which remain faithful to Zhaitan due to spending decades/centuries in servitude to him. Keep in mind that giving free will wouldn't mean they suddenly cease all faithfulness to their Elder Dragon. Even Glint remained faithful to Kralkatorrik after being given free will - it was only after hearing the thoughts of those she killed after regaining free will that she then decided to follow a different path.
---
Now, it is possible to tame an unintelligent unchained risen - as seen twice - but it's not exactly easy to do. In effect, these mindless risen are still following the last orders of Zhaitan.
---
In theory, some of the intelligent unchained risen could turn allied - same goes for the mordrem too, if there were any intelligent mordrem that weren't sylvari/Mordrem Guard - but this wouldn't be a common occurrence.
---
Awakened, on the other hand, never lost their intelligence (well, some did, over time as their bodies degraded), nor did they technically lose their free will. Rather, their will was subsided and overpowered rather than removed (and some, like Koss and Lonai, a lot less so; the implication being that Kormir gave them some level of protection, as she did to Tahlkora who's will couldn't be suppressed at all by Joko).
---
I missed this announcement, do you have a source or more information on thief portal? :o
---
When/how is portal going to be available to thiefs? I missed this info
---
I got a virus alert... On the new version ? Ignorer ir what to do?
---
I wouldn't say never fighting against others in the open world.  There are some quests (tasks, hearts, whatever) that have objectives that can't be shared, like killing ambient creatures that die in one hit.  Specifically I'm thinking about two DLC zones in the second expansions.  When the final mount was released, there was an uptick in players doing these, which made getting them done take annoyingly longer.  There are probably a few other quests like these in central Tyria, but shouldn't really be an issue since they're not repeatable.
---
Yeah I thought that was really interesting. How is the endgame?
---
Honestly, even thoughI LOVE Guild Wars 2, I need to agree. I've been so burnt out lately because I don't need/have interest in doing stories twice, I've done over 500 Dungeons and I wish they would make new ones instead of these collections, (aka the skyscale collections like wtf why). And it would be nice to finally get some earnable armor skins, Elegy armor was a step in the right direction, messed it up with stupid amounts of sigils though...
---
Try out
---
Why would say that?
---
Still 16 Gb recommended
---
All binary files are compiled from source via automatic compiling, so ignore it.
---
That's kinda like saying "I've been cooking meth since December and the DEA hasn't busted down my door yet".
---
I could yes, but I think we are missing the point here. The idea of this decoration is when you enter the guild hall you have this massive dragon flying around. shouldnt have to portal or jump our way to various locations to see it working the way it was intended. shouldnt it just work?
---
Definitely ignore the virus warnings and download this from a stranger on the internet.
---
Either PvP, or completing an absurd amount of collections, including cosmetic skins. 
---
There are raids, but they do not really serve the same function for long-term motivation as they do in other MMOs, as there is no gear progression or content gating attached to the raids.
---
I have filed a ticket with support. I have asked for all scribing matts to be returned. IU cant move guild hall and I shouldnt have too. 
---
I have hand made jumping puzzles in mine and I will lose them all :(
---
That would be the first thought, but it would require counting players.
---
One of the reasons skills have a limit of 5 targets and anet is so reticent to remove the limit is the strain on the servers it could cause.
---
it has happened tho lmao
---
It's literally in the trailer for the show
---
It's not a spoiler if it's in the trailer for the show
---
Some Risen decided to stay with Zhaitan even after latter one was killed. Unchained Risen Kingpins are way more intelligent than other Risen and they even boost their intelligence by being nearby and yet they still serve Zhaitan although he is gone.
---
Unchained kingping that killed sylvari claims that he is "Free to continue dispensing Zhaitan's wrath to the world".
---
&gt; The idea of this decoration is when you enter the guild hall you have this massive dragon flying around. shouldnt have to portal or jump our way to various locations to see it working the way it was intended. shouldnt it just work?
---
the idea is that it is a huge ass decoration that is expensive as fuck. it's a material sink, that provides a 1:1 copy of the huge hologram that can be seen in hoelbrak. yes, it "should just work", which incidentally is what it does. it just doesn't work the way *you* subjectively wanted it to, and in your anticipation you failed to do any reality check on your expectations.
---
How do I let other ranks invite people to the guild? Which box is that?
---
Okay cool. This gives me a lot to go off
---
Thanks for the quick and detailed explanation!
---
Some people love to expose themselves...and not in a good way, don't they?
---
Yeah I see the problem in that, especially for large scale pvp. I played a bunch of Albion online before it went F2P and there you have massive PVP battles on reset day. They actually started limiting ticks &amp; players hit per cast because for example bows aoe attacks would cause servers to literally slow down to a crawl.
---
However, I also know that counting players and having skills do damage, check stuff and proc other traits/abilities are 2 different things. Afaik WvW already counts players in a sense, otherwise it wouldn't display blobs on the map. It could simply be a area wide effect but it definitely wouldn't be perfect.
---
Heh when I saw the monster all I could think was 'Whoa that is one pissed off karka!'
---
Placing decorations could use some improvements:
---
Currently, we can only adjust a decoration in 2 ways:
---
* Pan it in the two horizontal axes
---
* Spit around the vertical axis.
---
To be able to decorate properly, we'd need:
---
* Pan in the vertical axis too, letting you adjust its height regardless of collisions. 
---
* Tilt it, that is, spin around a horizontal axis. 
---
* Scale it between a minimum and a maximum size. 
---
* Toggle collision. 
---
Maybe the empty skill slots 7, 8 and 9 while decorating could allow us to switch modes:
---
* Toggle Spin: Vertical/Horizontal.
---
* Toggle Pan: Vertical/Horizontal
---
* Toggle scaling mode: Scaling on/Scaling off. In scaling mode, moving the mouse up will increase the size of the model, and 
---
* And collision would be toggled with a special action key. 
---
Also, the decoration limit should be changed to work based on a score. Instead just counting the number of objects in the area when placing a decoration, the system would count a score.
---
* More complex decorations will cost more score than simpler ones.
---
* Variety would also increase the score more, 10 different decorations with the same base cost would add to more score than the same one 10 times.
---
The total limit for a guild hall would then change from 2 000 decorations to a score of 10 000.
---
There's no minimal damage req. Only the death part is correct.
---
No, as this is more like ReShade than a traditional "hack."
---
Used ReShade for a very long time before moving over to D912Pxy and haven't had an issue (and I've been using it since it was first released).
---
I think the difference is that when a living sylvari answers the call or when a living charr is branded, their soul has never left their body. Probably the same for living norn that get turned into icebrood.
---
When Zhaitan takes a body or when Mordremoth patches a bunch of bones together with vines to create a [Mordrem Wolf](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/6/69/Mordrem_Wolf.jpg), that soul has left the body a long time ago.
---
I've done them all... all paths.  Looking for people who are interested in wanting to stream as well as play.
---
It’s not P2W but it is guilty of being semi-predatory of completionist/shop-aholics.
---
So if you are good with the game allowing you to only pay for more convenience to play more effectively or change your look often, then you won’t mind the cash shop too much.
---
Also, before you run into it and think “WTF!?”  Yes there is a level 80 booster item to buy in the gemstore as well as waypoint unlocks.  1) don’t buy them they aren’t worth it and 2) some people identify pay for progress as pay to win, but in GW2 getting to the level cap is trivial and meaningless after your first few.
---
You can ignore it as it's a false positive (scanned with MalwareBytes and it's fine). If it's an issue - you can also compile the source yourself.
---
No kidding right?!
---
Isn't the shatter changes the only real way of fixing #3? No chrono is going to waste a CS just to give their team aegis.
---
It won't touch graphics (this isn't ReShade etc) but it will improve your FPS considerably.
---
I wasn't convinced that it made any difference on previous version from the install file. I tried installing the files from git hub instead and this seemed to improve things if I'm not mistaken. Can't wait to give this version a shot.
---
This works perfectly with 8gb ram for me
---
I actually single-handedly saved a fractal run once with that. We were doing Siren's Reef and it was hell (because the final fight is a poorly-designed clusterfuck of adds rather than an interesting culmination of mechanics). Everyone went down, everyone is dead. Except me. And my Signet of Agony. I believe Crowe was at \~10% health. She died how she lived: getting sucked.
---
I was gonna make this thread. We have his staff... now all we need is the tonic. Anet, please. &lt;3
---
&gt; Because people rushed them in 1-2 days
---
3 days! One of the weeklies was to finish 3 dailies
---
Last version was better-- now when I load a map, it takes ages for things to look normal.

&gt; Don't say stupid things when you don't know what you're talking about.
---
The pot and kettle phrase comes to mind around you pretty often.
---
Every fresh install have longer loading times
---
If you’ve read a guide thoroughly, watched a mechanics video, and you have a proper build from snowcrows that you’ve practiced the rotation for on the golem, you are already light years ahead of the average pug.
---
That is such awesome news. Thanks so much!
---
I think I don't know most skill names in this game, especially the weapon related ones.
---
Ovoliths, and they were in game at launch - Jan 25, 2011.
---
Southsun was added to GW2 Nov 15, 2012.  Almost a full 2 years later.
---
Here's an ovolith video: https://youtu.be/yJ0CV8lwRfc
---
Here's a karka video: https://youtu.be/FdMx6pzhlE4
---
Notice the spit, the roll, etc. are all literally exactly the same?  And I don't mean similar, I mean exactly the same.
---
Both games are good, but you'd have to be blind to not see they copied it.
---
Also, just from the bottom of my heart, thank you.
---
I love this game, but the terrible performance has always just made me... upset. And it's not worth upgrading because this is the ONLY game where my rig can't run it maxed due to the CPU constraints.
---
Thank you!
---
Trinkets are the most important by far, which is fortunate because ascended trinkets are pretty easy to get. Armor is 2% and weapons are 3% iirc
---
from fractal perspective,precast gona be weaker,lossing invu is sad,but doesnt rly have impact on anything,most of the skips are with GG in mind anyway. unable to shatter without illusion gona be just  2-3 weeks of getting used to.
---
this whole *rebalance* is making chrono just MORE clunky and less fun to use.
---
Is there any gw2 launcher that installs and updates addons automatically?
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.

Joko didn't send Koss to the cave. Koss went there himself to get away from Joko and the Awakened.
---
&gt; Awakened Koss Dejarin: Compelled to obey his every order! I banished myself here to evade them. Can't obey what you can't hear.
---
&gt; Awakened Koss Dejarin: His whispers travel far, even on others' lips. I dare not leave. Lest I become his weapon once more.
---
Forgotten plot. Hope she's brought back some day, together with Malyck, the surviving Mordrem Guard, and the Nightmare Court.
---
Most people seem to have given you a good idea of this, but it's really scattershot, so I felt like making something more comprehensive.
---
I don't think anything about the game is P2W and there's only I think a handful of things that I find morally questionable. I'll start with why things aren't P2W.
---
First off, there's nothing much to "win". PvP uses standardized gear and standardized levels. A new player can go into PvP in white level 1 gear and do the same damage as I can in level 80 magenta gear. You can conceivably be more successful in the largescale PvP gamemode that uses gear stats (WvW) but that only helps in combat which is not where rewards mostly come from. Most rewards players seek come from reward chests that you progress through just by participating over a long span of time. You can get the same or MORE participation credit by simply running back and forth flipping camps. And most of the time when you're in combat in WvW, it's in a huge group of people where no one's gear really matters (if you take hits from 50 people each hitting you for 5K damage, your gear is meaningless). Lastly there's PvE and this is where the P2W argument maybe drunkenly stands up for a second.
---
The gear in PvE has Ascended at the top, Exotic just below that, then Rare, Masterwork, Common, and white gear which I forget the name for. To do endgame content, you will want to be in at least Exotic gear. Now, the game shits exotic gear on you like candy. Some stat sets are restricted to the owners of certain expansions (Viper's for HoT, Harrier's for PoF) but there are reasonable downgrades for those elsewhere (Carrion/Sinister and Magi's, respectively). The game also dumps gold on you pretty quickly, particularly if you do your dailies (2g a day) and do Tequatl each day (another 2g). I don't know what exotic gear is going for now, but I checked a few months ago and that 4g a day could get you and entire set of reasonably good Exotic armor. One day. I think you would have to be monumentally stupid to break out the credit card to convert gems into gold to buy some fucking exotic armor. The only real problem comes with Ascended gear. Like I said, that's the tier above. You don't NEED it for most endgame content, but it helps. It has, roughly, 13% higher stats than Exotic gear. It also has unique slots in the gear for infusions. The important infusion here is Agony Resistance. You need AR to play the higher levels of one type of PvE endgame: Fractals. Fractals themselves can be a GREAT source of Ascended gear. So, again, why would someone pay money to make Ascended armor instead of just playing the lowest levels of Fractals (which you need to do to advance your personal fractal level anyhow) and getting gear over time? ALSO, the Living World seasons have introduced dead-easy ways of acquiring ascended trinkets and backpieces. The expansions give you free ascended versions of the elite specializations' weapons for free once you complete collections. You can do raid collections for a free set of ascended armor. But even if you don't want to do one of those ways of playing the game for that gear, you still might do the others, and each ascended piece you get lowers the % difference between your gear and "perfect" gear (IIRC trinkets give the largest boost of like 17%, weapons give 10%, and armor gives 8%).

Okay, that's the closest I think GW2 gets in terms of P2W. You can, theoretically, decide to skip literally any progression or sense of accomplishment or mastery of the game, and buy your way to a fractional increase in stats that don't matter in endgame of one part of one gametype over me who simply plays for \~40 minutes a day and uses the gold I get from that to buy 20 silver exotic gear.
---
Now, other things people mention with GW2 that I don't think are P2W but people talk about them.
---
Convenience items: You can buy unlimited salvage kits. Copper-fed is the only one that's really worthwhile. Silver-fed is just a shittier version of the Mystic one you can make with stuff you'll get flooded with if you get your login rewards consistently. You can buy unlimited tools. Honestly, I almost never harvest things anyhow, so I see almost zero reason to get unlimited tools. Oh no, I have to visit a vendor who I'm already at selling crap, how inconvenient.
---
Bank Space: Your usual "extra space" upgrades everyone's seen. Except it's actually more cost-effective to get new characters and throw all your shit on them.
---
Skins: The game has a LOT of skins on the gemstore or similarly pay-to-get. Thing is, almost all of these are available on the trading post for gold.
---
Finally, let me go over the things that are morally questionable/I wish they would get rid of.
---
Black Lion Chests, particularly exclusives: These are loot boxes. You will always get a statuette which, when you collect enough, you can use as currency to get what you want, so that's okay in my book. The problem is that there are certain items that they make only obtainable via opening these boxes or, much later, by the statuette currency. Also, you could drop 2000+ gold on the trading post, but that's a bit steep. You CAN also get a free key every week by running a burner character through the level 10 personal story, and that helps, but it still feels a bit scummy for me.
---
Sales that come and go: ANet does that thing lots of other stores do where items come and go from the store so people get a false sense of scarcity. I don't really give a shit about those sorts of things now that Wardrobe Unlockers are a thing, but I can see how vulnerable people might get sucked into that.
---
Living World Seasons: New players get more and more of these to buy and Seasons 3 an 4 have some great sources of ascended trinkets and backpieces. As a veteran player, I got these for free, but I can see how it might sting for someone to drop money for the expansions and then feel compelled to drop more for the seasons. That said, they've also got amazing story and maps, so you aren't JUST paying for access to ascended shit, you are getting expansion-level content.
---
And that's basically it. I gave up halfway in trying to be crazy thorough. Ranked PvP gives an assload of gold even if you are bad or play casually. The free game has one of the best gold farms so you never feel compelled to buy an expansion or season to get the best gold rate per hour. I could go on.
---
Wow, now that's something. The similarity is undeniable.
---
I wouldn't call it "cynical."  If it were cynical it would punish you for breaking a streak.  This is meant to strongly incentivize you to log in every day but is forgiving if you skip, as you never lose progress.
---
Yeah would love that
---
From what I have been able to figure out, the whole rift path needs to finish being 'built' before the buff will trigger.
---
For a long path, hitting that respawned rift right away won't trigger the buff because the path still hasn't been completed yet. If I guesstimate how long it will probably take for a particular path to be built and then wait, that seems to do the trick when I hit that respawned rift again.
---
THX. Just asking.
---
Aw yes! RAM usage down from like \~4gb to \~3gb. CPU down to 60% from like...idk 75% i guess. neat!
---
Cm fractal runners of course, and some Raiders too.
---
You know, the top of the pve food chaln (which is like... 90% of the population?).
---
Maybe it's me because english isn't my first language, but your post kind of makes you sound like a total jerk?
---
And, btw, noone stacks "every possible infusion". They just have the looks they want because they can afford it... You sound quite jealous to be honest. 
---
I do agree with you in your last point, you shouldn't be there at all... Even though if say noone would notice you anyway :p
---
Glhf and good riddance!
---
"While reapers were designed to be durable frontline fighters, the Soul Eater trait is providing a little too much survivability, so we're removing the ability for this trait to heal while in a shroud."
---
Can we not do this, please? Why not just reduce the amount of healing we get, or make it so we can be healed while in Shroud!?.
---
Because, it's a little difficult to be durable, frontline fighters if we can't keep our health above 90%.

Thank you for the detailed reply!
---
I understand what you mean.
---
It's good to know that you didn't notice the change in VA, it shows that the new VA did a good job at staying true to the character.
---
...you don't use rocket boots back to back? What? How do you use it? I constantly use it 2 in a row, and it's way nicer to use now than it was before it was ammo.
---
It's a discussion thread, not a feedback thread. OP didn't ask you to make your own suggestions. If you wanted to contribute something relevant, try discussing OP's idea.
---
This guy never had a "your retal scales with condi dmg" grandmaster.
---
I'm aware, it's quite upsetting, thanks for the input :)
---
When the devs balance the server, they balance it based on the server populations/hours they calculated for that link. The problem is large amounts of players then pay to mass transfer whole guilds out into the sub server of say Blackgate, which causes the imbalance back.
---
All they have to do is delay all server transfers to right before the next time re-link happens and you would never have this problem. That way nobody can cheat their way into T1, because you wont know the incoming re-link. Arenanet wont do that yet because they are making money off of these transfers.
---
This seems to be a feature that they will be doing with alliances though.
---
we dont really get the Marketing either
---
HoT and PoF come on sale regularily though, and sometimes theres bundles…
---
you mean [this](https://buy.guildwars2.com/store?Action=html&amp;Locale=en_US&amp;SiteID=gw2&amp;_ga=2.180908519.1339574829.1563086909-92969926.1504553773&amp;cid=104%3A5%3A%3A%3A%3AGlobal%3A40%3A%3A%3A&amp;pbPage=heartofthorns&amp;themeID=4785548000)?

Basically the entire world has heard of "Area 51" from movies or books or news or ANYTHING.

It's "Admin Lower Ranks.", but take care, it also gives the right to kick lower ranks, so you have to sort the ranks the right way.
---
&gt;What's the point of any expensive cosmetics if you're the only one who gets to see it? This isn't a single player game.
---
The novel idea of "This dye looks fantastic, I'm buying it no matter how expensive it is!" Because YOU like the way it looks, other peoples' opinions be damned.

Thank you for the reply!
---
I have heard many times that the new male charr VA isn't as good as the old one. The fact that you say otherwise is a refreshing change :)
---
There's a similarity in the rolling and jump/drop attacks, but I'd hardly call any of it "stolen frame-for-frame". Every other attack looks pretty distinct and the design of the creatures is radically different.
---
You can get it [here](https://buy.guildwars2.com/store?Action=html&amp;Locale=en_US&amp;SiteID=gw2&amp;_ga=2.180908519.1339574829.1563086909-92969926.1504553773&amp;cid=104%3A5%3A%3A%3A%3AGlobal%3A40%3A%3A%3A&amp;pbPage=heartofthorns&amp;themeID=4785548000) or by clicking the button that says "Add HoT for $20" when buying PoF.
---
is that what the game looks like when your graphics aren't set to the lowest settings?
---
What is it about the male human that make him sound like he is having a good time? Some have said that he sounds emotionless, which makes me very curious to learn more about your point of view...
---
*&gt;Complete extinction of it as a class that can even remotely be used in blobbing.*
---
Trailblazer Mirage should keep from going completely extinct in blobbing. It's survivable and can dish some damage at least.  
---
But desired?  Probably not.
---
Thanks a lot! :)
---
I've started doing this too and it's made my life a lot easier and less frustrating. The only sucky thing is when you forget. &gt;&lt;
---
I didn't once say nor imply that it was bad.  That was the reason anet nixed them.
---
If that's the case, then it is probably a technical limitation. Like the exception is thrown at a more abstract level than professions..
---
If you found yourself liking the game enough and can afford it, you should get expansion ASAP.  This is because a paid account will give you daily login rewards and some of them can be rather valuable in crafting endgame stuff. 
---
Also, a paid account will lift chat restrictions as well as trading post (auction house) restrictions. The restrictions are there mainly to prevent bot abuse on f2p accounts.
---
Besides, a paid account will also make you eligible to convert ingame gold to cash store gems.  Granted you won't be making much as a new player for now, it's a nice option to have.
---
Lastly, a paid account gives you more character slot and more bag slot.  Tbh each class is so interestingly different you'll find yourself making alts in no time just to test things out :)
---
Your fix to Chrono being worse than Firebrigade is to make it worse?
---
&gt; could we change the skyscale stamina a little?
---
so im suggesting changing skyscale stamina a little. wtf is your problem
---
True true
---
IIRC (I may be wrong), it was in reply to getting new content.
---
Either way, we'd need to no doubt organize a mass purchase event during a sale to get some motivation. Or maybe polls. Or both. But I doubt any of that will happen sadly.
---
well yes, there definitely are "construct" dragon minions. i guess it is a bit different with zhaitan then - depends on corpse if it was animated or corrupted living being
---
In my experience, I’ve been able to do every rift by simply flying it once to collect the magic, then activating it again and completing it to obtain the mote.
---
Copper fed salvage, and a permanent pass to one of the lounges (mistlock sanctuary, armistice bastion, etc.) Are my top two picks
---
I believe he's talking about Chrono only, and Chrono/Mirage are 2 separate classes, just similar.
---
Yes, Thief stolen skills are a main mechanic of their profession. It dictates how they play the class. 
---
The raid stolen skills (in particular the plasma) are just crazy stupid broken, idk how Anet ever thought they were a good idea.
---
Takes very little for private servers to get shut down, is his point
---
It's a brand new account, apparently. My money says "troll account."
---
Yea probably. We go to Cantha because it seems for anet gw2 is what they wanted gw1 to be so the emperor is batshit loco like scarlet but with actual power and influence. Season 5 we go to Cantha pretty early and establish the emperor. Expac 3 is war against the emperor. Season 6 is us fighting deep sea dragon.
---
It's not a story the GW2 players would tell you.
---
I’d love that but it would be ok if it was something else too
---
Put the archive/file through virustotal and see how many hits you get, there.
---
r/buildapc can help you for sure!
---
I'd really love to see that putting them to sleep was more "permanent" (I mean, those two die accidentally) than we anticipated and we get to deal with mess of too much magic being released. Then we get dragon champions going wild, some ley line overloading events, maybe Tyria mixing partially with the Mists too. That would also open doors to exploring new areas, because of necessary evacuation. If anyone want's to battle dragons, there is always Steve aka Bubbles left.  Just a thought.
---
[This is my new language file.](https://github.com/Snowy1794/TacO-Language-Chinese/blob/master/TacO_Language_cn.xml) I used the new gw2taco.exe you gave above.  
---
I gave up using Simplified Chinese.I chose Traditional Chinese.The purpose is to better adapt to the font.
---
Now it is perfect !!! Thank you!
---
I had that happen too!
---
That is WITH boosters. Potions from dailies and the instant consume potions from the pips will knock it down some more but even if you manage to get down to 200% that is still spending twice the amount of time to get the same amount of stuff.
---
Hey guys! My account was hacked 4 years ago and the user got my account banned. I finally got it back today and have no idea what’s going on lol. I have 5 level 80s(played before the expansions came out) and 1 with full map completion. I need someone to shoot me a guide, or take me under their wing for a bit to get me back into the game. Much appreciated!!
---
well if all of these dozens of bots which are playing gw1 daily would also participate in the poll we could get our new content :D
---
So majestic
---
that would remove chrono completly from the game in fractals if you want to run a teamcomp.  
---
beside running meta, you still have the option to run with a chrono + druid and cover boons with that comp.  
---
taking away either just removes chrono because no alacrity anymore, so you have to play firebrigade.
---
Yeah body type is definitely norn. Not sure why the downvotes 🤭
---
I notice on the TP there are many pieces of level 80 gear with generic names like "Shield," "Sword," "Axe," etc. These items are listed at crazy prices; for example, there's one Axe listed at 499g right now. Can anyone explain why these items are listed for so much?
---
what groupcomp do you even play? as it is rn for fractals chrono is way, WAY worse than the fb/ren combo is already rn and in raids, chrono+fb+druid+ren is best option because it provides 100% uptime and is way better dps than 2chrono+healer+druid.
---
Also you forget one VERY important thing, Renegade is 10man alac which is only f4 and fb has super easy time to upkeep 100% quickness and neither gets punished as hard as chrono does when someone runs out of either boons because chrono needs allies to have either quickness and alac to upkeep it, having slight drop if you cast SoI and your entire uptime is out of loop. Which makes chrono harder to upkeep alac and quickness.
---
Seriously stop bitching about nerfing chrono because it's more and more dead and unfun each single patch.
---
Wouldn't mind seeing something new, maybe tengu and sky islands? Giant sky dragon thats a good guy, flame legion and their quest for godly stuff and whatnot. Tengu playable race for the fucking love of God come the fuck on already &gt;.&gt;
---
Also, it's not worth it, just get the Griffin!
---
She is fine. We all went to harrass her with our warclaw for some ap
---
&gt;250 materials (that one you gifted to unlock)
---
Not necessarily so, given that the second event was donating Volatile Magic, and the recipe is Globs of Ectoplasm.
---
But yeah, most likely Wild-Eye Miller skin recipes.
---
They should really offer a complete collection that includes all of the available Living World episodes as well, because the expansions are far from being all of the content, and LW story is directly tied to them (expansion stories will make no sense without completing the previous living world season).
---
I'd rather it be a quaggann and the water dragon.
---
Nice detail on Bow for the Glow string, it's a shame it's desapear If you use mount attack, i hate that never fixed bug.
---
Where's that artwork from? 
---
One of the Revelers in Dragon Bash is a female warning a Son of Svanir that she hears Dragon (Jormag) too.  
---
Sons of Svanir reject females because Jora defeated Svanir, but females getting interested in getting the power Dragon gives could hint to something in the future.
---
Maybe Jormag and Primordus will get their own 'commander champion' heralds and maddened by hunger try to consume each other's magic, and we have to stop them from fighting each other before they nullify each other's magic and destroy Tyria.
---
I have a GTX1070 and a i7 2.80GHz CPU, can I expect any use out of this?
---
No one really knows, because offering it at random times increases impulse buys.
---
What gear should i aim for a fresh lvl 80 druid
---
Skyscale is wonderful but you dont have to rush!
---
Get PoF, enjoy the mounts in it already and make sure you fall in love with the game and metas first and then start buying episodes when you can (sale should happen in August!)
---
Ahh. I did wonder why elsewhere in the wiki it says Koss managed to trick them into telling him to guard that useless cave.
---
No, you just have to follow the path without missing a node. You don't have infinite time, but you can probably do it without ever dashing.
---
The problem is, if you don't get the buff when you start the rift, you won't get the Mistborn Mote at the end, even if you got all the nodes on the way there.
---
1) The best way to level the first time is to do the story.  The Story is the tutorial.  
---
2) Yes and No.  By the time you get to 80 you will be 100% specked using hero points so there are no mistakes just less optimal ways to get to 100%.  When it comes active skills/traits then you can respect in a few min and many people do quite often.
---
3) [https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle\_Wiki](https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki) many help but do what works for you metabattle is a good aid but not a rule sheet.
---
Kodan
---
Having a "breather" from world ending threats is welcome. Instead of increasing the threat over and over and over.
---
I would love to go Beat Up Jormag, with the Son's of Svanir, Norns kinda get left alone, so more Norn would be nice
---
He was the largest because it was a plant, not because he was the oldest.
---
to clarify, respec doesn't mean changing your class, ex. you cant change ranger to elementalist or guardian, for that you have to make a new character.
---
but you can do is change the rangers specializations, you will eventually unlock all of the traits and skills as you go. The current specs for rangers are druid that is more of healer focused and soulbeast that is more of a hunter/dps themed. and you can change them when out of combat.
---
don't ask, try out!
---
&gt;My plan is to go for a ranger [...] my main goal is to do "World Vs World"
---
Well... How to tell you...
---
There is a good reason he’s famous (or perhaps infamous) for his voicing of so so many video game characters, predominantly main characters. He just really pulls off the delivery of the wisecracking hero. He has variety though; Mordremoth and Joko are just the examples from this game.
---
How long have you been using it on 8gb? I've tried using it more than once, and kept having crashes due to, what I assume is, not enough memory. Did you have the same problem?
---
Damn, such a well and detailed response, thank you very very much for that! I was always under the impression, that Guild Wars had the best community out there, and this sure makes sense!
---
I appreciate the help derd4100!  
---
I might want to reconsider Ranger? :-X
---
I’m on NA and will do! Glad to be back lol there’s just sooo much new info to consume
---
Mounts imO will ruin the HoT experience. 
---
Both expacs are worth it, youll probably enjoy PoF more if youve played HoT and LS S3 before...
---
HoT is designed without mounts in mind but they make traveling easier.
---
It will run it. Not great. You can play it turned down. I was playing on a duo and a 210 when it first came out. Its just not gonna be happy days lol. But it will run it.
---
Ahh yes.  That makes much more sense.  Although I would imagine I would get a lot more use from this mod if I had more VRAM than 2GB.  That + the fact my computer is straight up old now makes me want to build a new one.
---
I would choose mounts over gliding, especially when you get the griffon later on (it replaces the glider for most content other than combat - you can't mount in combat but you can glide). Eventually you will want both.
---
You don't need either expansion when starting out though - the game is free to play pre-expansion (and many of us played that version of the game for years just fine). You have every class (except revenant) and you can reach max level. You can do all forms of PvP on equal footing with the free game (more options for playstyles open up with expansion) and you can do all the five player instanced content fine without an expansion.
---
The only thing you need expansions for is to open up your build options with elite specs, the expansion maps and masteries, and raids. The core game is pretty solid, although I personally enjoy expansion content a lot more.
---
General advice starting out would be to take your time and explore. If find things to hard, try a different class (ranger and necromancer are both on the easier end of the spectrum).
---
More damage, more CC, tons of sustain... Only in like tryhard Mirage comps it comes out worse but casually it's still probably gonna be better just due to the utility/CC.
---
im not saying i need it lol,but its LITERALY - 5 SEC OF INVU replaced by nothing. i dont play pvp or wvw and im gona adapt ofc,i survived  50 chrono nerfs with learning  10 new rotations. i guess thief AA spam is still rotation? how whoud you feel if anet removed 4 dodges from thief? you whoud take it like a champ i bet =)
---
Warrior, elementalist, revenant, guardian, or necro. 4/5 of the meta builds 100% require an expansion though, so if you don’t want to invest in expansions yet go with elementalist.
---
i too want dungeons to matter, i came late to the game (was in beta and launch but left shortly after launch) and came back to the game at ls3.2. by this time dungeons were dead and i had a lot of catching up to do with the story and achievements. i have managed to get at least 1 run through every exploration except cof, needed for the cheev. the last time cof was a daily i managed to join a party, but by the time i caught up with the party they were at the end boss. i managed to get the daily, but not the cheev. (must have been a different path than exploration)
---
as soon as i run out of easy ap i will head to some dungeon guild/discord and get every ap available and all the skins, then run fractals/raids.
---
And largos
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Can't have someone outsmart the hero.
---
Always into the ~~east~~ north.
---
Everything is possible with retcon, but jokes aside I know it was said explicitly but the whole "Tyria being destroyed" would not have to happen instantly. Fe. dragons dying gradually, magic seeping out of them causing massive cataclysm. Look what they did with Taimi - she is Mary Sue (even more than Trahearne) giving deus ex machina solution on the go. Why not make her and us be wrong about what is currently happening? But tbh. that was just idea I had, not gonna defend it as the #bestplotsolutionever.
---
Zou exaggerating when you suggest that dungeons were only relevant for 6 month. They were one of the most lucrative sources of income for a long time up until HoT.
---
No it would the reason we weren't going to kill Kralk when we thought Aurene was gone for good was because the power explosion would kill us. Killing Primordus and Jormag is essentially the same amount of magic split between 2 dragons.
---
Kralkatorrik wasn't that big of a deal to the Charrs (and vice versa). Primordus, on the other hand, is closely tied to the Charrs.
---
Well, what you have described sound like [Endless Combat Kodan Tonic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endless_Kodan_Tonic) to me, which already exists in the game.
---
Well, in the quote you posted earlier Koss said he banished himself to the cave to prevent himself from being used to further Joko's schemes in the future. So if we combine the aforementioned stories from Koss and the priest to reveal the full truth, it appears that Koss was deliberately trying to trick his superiors by annoying them enough (as far as he could go with it due to the geas he was under) to eventually force them to cut ties with him and send him to one of the few places where Joko's whispers wouldn't reach him. I suppose the wiki's wording could be edited to make Koss's plan even more clear although the game leaves it somewhat ambiguous due to the event having happened a long time ago. :)
---
Well said, I agree with you entirely. I thought Joko was a pretty interesting character but his absence was kind of abrupt and indeed felt like wasted potential to me.
---
Maybe he's implying there's not enough incentive to play right now
---
Sexy af
---
&gt;I think the best approach for that is to make us do the job, but have someone else take credit. Like, some sort of commander who hires us in the first place, and give us some equipment and information on how to do the job. Then we can just do whatever we want, but we never become public superheroes, the guy who organized everything is the actual hero.
---
Yeah, that's what I was thinking as well. I normally point to Tequatl as the perfect example of this. You have a commander issuing orders, and because people know what to do and where to be, it gives the illusion of higher level organization.
---
Normally people in a group are just a dumb reactive blob, but provide a pattern and a puppet to issue instructions (or a rabbit to follow, if you want to use a dog racing metaphor), and they'll act in ways that seem collectively intelligent.
---
&gt;The lore should also state clearly that there are other groups doing similar missions as well, so we don't feel too important. 
---
Yes. What I think is most important to make it all feel real is that combat isn't the only thing to do.
---
When I played WoW, I played on a WPvPRP server. And I played a pacifist character, because I didn't see the point in playing on an RP server where being a pacifist meant nothing. Non-combat career paths bring the world to life and enhance the stakes of combat. If you can't protect the people who don't fight, then you're in a heap of trouble.
---
&gt;Maybe we could meet some of them too, as NPCs. Instead of making us lead the raid into a dungeon, make us go there once another better team got in a stalemate with the enemy, and we find them somewhat weakened.
---
I like this idea. I hadn't really considered it. But I definitely like it.
---
&gt;We don't even need complete mod tools, stuff to just let us organize community events properly would be great.
---
Again, 100% agree. Just providing enforceable contract mechanics goes a long way. There's no other real way to ensure player trust in a sandbox where anybody can dick anybody over.
---
&gt;Maybe you didn't understand my "fixed character" approach, so let me elaborate:
---
Nah, I got it, I'm just sandbox all the way. I look at EVE's sandbox and see a lot of what I want, but it's just surrounded by gameplay I intensely dislike, and the skillpoint system, which I think is just cancer.
---
I'm hoping that some games like Crowfall or Dual Universe will fill the void, with an EVE-like sandbox but much more involved gameplay.
---
&gt;And yeah, I never liked WoW either. The gameplay and the progression both feel terrible to me, specially when W3 custom map RPGs were so good.
---
I like parts of WoW. I enjoy the gameplay well enough. I'm honestly not a huge fan of tab targeting MMO's, but I find them tolerable. Turn based RPG's are incredibly boring, and FPS's are my preferred mode of gameplay. Though I prefer turn based RTS', because I find they're more manageable and there's rarely a shortage of shit to do.
---
WoW is the only game that feels "comfy" to me. There's something that just feels soothing and familiar about hanging out in Orgrimmar. I don't know why. I don't think that Guild Wars has anything similar. And I really don't know why. Maybe it's WoW's art style, the palette they use - I don't know. I didn't even have to play for very long before I started feeling that way - it took about a few days. So it isn't like it was nostalgia. It was something about the design. Nor was it because I had only recently heard about "comfy" games. I'd read 4chan posts about how comfy various games were for years, and I'd never "gotten" it. But WoW made it work for me somehow. Dunno why.
---
Basically, I liked a lot of the world and stuff surrounding the core gameplay of WoW. But the core gameplay was only alright, and the motivation to keep doing it after I got kinda bored wasn't there, because lol lootgrind isn't motivating.
---
I played most around Warlords of Draenor. Everyone else hated that expansion because lmoa no content. But I actually look back on it fondly, because I didn't force myself to play through content until I was sick of it. I played for a few months, got my enjoyment, and dropped the game.
---
&gt;Don't undervalue yourself. Many of the best game designers began their careers shitposting at forums. Lot of vanilla WoW devs on particular are famous for being veteran players of older MMOs, and constantly talking shit about them.
---
Oh yeah. I saw some of Jeff Kaplan's posts from the everquest forum and I thought it was just fucking hilarious.

But I know that I don't know everything, and critiquing specific decisions from where I'm sitting is also really difficult. I don't have access to player analytics, so I don't know what discrepancies there are between what people are saying and what they're doing. I don't know how "real" some problems are. I don't know a lot of things that inform dev decisions. And I don't know what sort of technical barriers may be preventing them from realizing specific solutions.
---
A lot of that information is super important, so without access to it, I don't really feel equipped to say what the right call is. If I understand the situation correctly, then I think I may present workable solutions. But devoid of that additional context, I'm never too confident. And devs don't normally share that sort of data with players.
---
Does this affect your ping/latency in game?
---
All though this is true, I would find it rather dumb to waste real money gear that you can get from crafting and playing the game such as fractals, raids, wvw, pvp, stories, map currency and more. And later on will have to much of anyway. And on top of that, in the end it wont be your gear that carry you. Combat is skillbased. If you are bad no gear will carry you anyway and you will remain bad. If you have bis gear and learn to be good, your gear will support you but you still have to work for being good.
---
Tbh i think that is a good idea. But make sure to play the story at least two times because not being a sylvari but another race makes it different. Not gonna say why, just that it will be different.
---
I'll gladly help you. Want to msg me here, in game or discord?
---
its funny how people say dungeons are dead and there are always groups going on (EU) for all of them and even if the lfg is empty they fill pretty fast if you just put an lfg up...for all of the paths.  
---
...even did dungon runs at 1 - 2 am in the morning in the last 3 months on working days and it still filled up.
---
I'm not techy at all, but I play on a laptop that doesn't perform well when plugged in, so I do "hard things" while unplugged. How would this add-on affect my battery life?
---
It’s still less than aurora in my opinion
---
They still fill in NA. OP prob just whiny bout getting kicked from 1
---
Have you tried any of your **Achievement** yet? It is in your Hero window. Look it up.
---
-
---
Any tips for **Long way around**?
---
With this game will use more gpu and cpu power, that will drain your battery more.
---
Why not make a fun collection praising Joko, instead of making everything gemstore?
---
&gt;A reminder that wvw needs some love too
---
 
---
FTFY
---
Mordremoth's story was pretty good, I think.  The general arc of the expansion felt weird but I liked him as a villain
---
And they gave Ruler of the Skies as a title. Such a nice title.
---
Yes... few hours on dragonsblood vs many hours kralk tho
---
I sure wish the game is gonna live that long
---
Harrier gear for sure in PvE, raid heal druid [build here](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/druid/heal/) and [guide here](https://snowcrows.com/raids/guides/ranger/druid/heal/). I'd suggest [this guide on gearing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) as well to get you started.
---
OMG I never tried that, this changes everything
---
There once data mined a fake joko tonic by that_shaman.
---
Gw2 was made as a game with evolving story. Devs release new chapters with maps and stuff every 3-4 months. For free if you play, but if you start now, everything from the past must be bought separately either with game gold or gems. We are currently in Season 4 episode 6 so a long as you log into game before new one comes out (we are just guessing it could be September) this one will be free for you forever.
---
gonna do this now thx i was lvling leatherworking since i didnt know where to get one
---
What is your ping time? Open a command window(the black one)  and ping the servers you connected to.
---
Many reasons as said below but also because we, the players, didn't like monthlies and were happy with them gone.  Of course, humans being humans, many people on reddit now think they were the best just because they're bored.  If they were brought back, give it enough time, and people will want them gone again.  The best decision was what they did with the daily logins.  Taking aside the human boredom factor (really, if you're bored with GW2, take up some other game and hobbies in addition), the daily system they have is so much better than those awful monthlies.
---
It can be further improved, sure (give us more choices), but monthlies are something many players do not want.  Also, remember, you can together with your friends and make up some stupid monthlies yourself and challenge each other who can do it first.  The reward?  Make a pot, winner gets the pot.  That will be much more entertaining than actual monthlies.
---
From a casual pve player, I actually liked the looks of the Chrono changes
---
I was just running a couple of dungeons yesterday! I agree - I really want dungeons to matter again! They need some attention.
---
Used to run it on AMD A6 notebook
---
open black command window and ping your Anet server
---
thx gonna read them
---
HoT not only was first but offers much more valuable content. 
---
With HoT you get:
---
*Gliding, never fall to your death again.
---
*Continuous story, if you care for it.
---
*Best raids, 4 wings, not too hard, with legendary armor
---
*Ability to use guild hall features like boons.
---
*Best gear for condi dps (game have two different dps types, core game have best power type, hot the other one). This covers all dps roles in game, gear wise. Best tanking gear. All together with core you get all essential WvW stats too.
---
*Actually challenging open world with places where soloing is possible only for seasoned veterans
---
*Acces to buy LS3, 6 chapters focused on elder dragon research and being a prequel to PoF. Best top tier trinket source in game.
---
PoF gives you:
---
*Mounts, that trivialize core game
---
*3 stupidly hard raids where only one big reward is one legendary ring
---
*Best gear for healers and some support characters. Big downside is that many of PoF classes are condi focused so you need HoT to get most of them.
---
*Acces to buy LS4 that is a decent source of top tiet trinkets (ls3 is better) and story is a PoF epilogue, with really dramatic and epic events.
---
*Chill and fully soloable open world zones.
---
If you think that raiding endgame is for you, and you like challenge then grab HoT first. 
---
If you want just to chill, skip content and play mostly guildless and solo then go for PoF.
---
According to common sense.
---
It's an effect that increases action speed by 50%. Having it stack duration like that was really weird from a game balance standpoint.
---
It'd be a different thing if we had a stat that increases attack speed, something like "Agility", or "Impetus". 
---
But it's an effect. By letting it stack 100% uptime, anyone who doesn't bring it and stacks it 100% uptime would be gimping themselves by not doing so, and that effectively forces everyone to bring it.
---
It just doesn't make any sense.
---
I'd rather see them make money with something like this, than with shitty lootboxes.
---
Most race hate in this game, pls don’t Anet
---
Reward track system is already in the game, just gotta implement it for PvE somehow
---
That, or moving towards the Deep Sea dragon.
---
Whaaaaat? Primordus is tied to Asura! He drove them from their underground home and they have reason to want to fight with him. But Charr? Where is the connection?
---
You should check your power settings, it should definitely not be performing better on battery than when plugged in.
---
The only way to get rid of lootboxes is to get rid of them altogether. ANET should put their hammer down on black lion chests.
---
After that, I'd be okay with more gemstore items.
---
Is he really, though? Abaddon made the Titans, which were the charr gods at the start of GW1. After we defeated the Titans, the charr had to look elsewhere. Around the time the Great Destroyer was doing his thing, the Flame Legion began worshipping Destroyers in place of Titans. We defeated them anyway, freed the other legions, and killed the Great Destroyer. The time in which Primordus was relevant to charr culture was pretty short-lived.
---
Like, sure there's some historical connection between the charr and Primordus, but I do not see him as closely tied to them. Definitely not enough to warrant a severe emotional drive to kill him specifically.
---
Primordus and asura? Absolutely.
---
Norn and Jormag? Without a doubt.
---
But I feel Kralk was much more impactful to charr, and even then, most charr seem to see Kralk as just another threat to add to the list. I don't think they have nearly as much investment in one particular dragon, likely because they had lore going on before the Elder Dragons were added to the story.
---
He said he have pof and mounts and wants SkyS. And you tell him to buy episodes without explaining what for? I'll do it for you.
---
SkyFella requires PoF that you already have and all Living Story 4 episodes. To start getting it, you must finish last episode story first. 
---
Keep in mind that you not only need story of last one but also partially other episodes. Of course it's best to do them all in order because they are so far the best in game.
---
To Vabbi
---
That's what I'd think, but then again would they do that for a second time. I'd be interested in seeing how rytlock would interact with Shiro.
---
The disadvantage of sandboxes is the inability to guarantee a compelling storyline. It's like WvW vs PvP, some days might be great, but others might be boring as shit. PvP however, fun is always guaranteed, because it's structured differently, with less "sandbox freedom", guaranteeing fights every match
---
You can have a great day in a sandbox, and then be terribly bored the next one. Progression systems are really hard to pull off right too, which hinders RPG elements greatly (and balance too, but I don't give a damn, it's a sandbox, players have tools to fight imbalance).
---
The only way I could see it working right, is if there were no allied NPCs in the whole game (or a bare minimum, at very specific locations, with only the most basic services, and of deity status). And of course, it wouldn't be your usual RPG, but more like a survival/builder game. Some external element would be needed to drive action forward, these could be something like demonic invasions or portals to other worlds. A pure sandbox needs permanent impact, so you can't just have shit respawn for the sake of it, if you raze a forest, it should stay razed.
---
I don't know, I think the perfect model lies somewhere in between, balancing both styles properly. There must be a way to make every character have its own story, without feeling like a superhero, but without feeling like your actions are meaningless either.
---
&gt; Oh yeah. I saw some of Jeff Kaplan's posts from the everquest forum and I thought it was just fucking hilarious.
---
&gt; But I know that I don't know everything, and critiquing specific decisions from where I'm sitting is also really difficult. I don't have access to player analytics, so I don't know what discrepancies there are between what people are saying and what they're doing. I don't know how "real" some problems are. I don't know a lot of things that inform dev decisions. And I don't know what sort of technical barriers may be preventing them from realizing specific solutions.
---
&gt; A lot of that information is super important, so without access to it, I don't really feel equipped to say what the right call is. If I understand the situation correctly, then I think I may present workable solutions. But devoid of that additional context, I'm never too confident. And devs don't normally share that sort of data with players.
---
Most of the game developers out there don't have this information either when they begin developing their games, so it's not that big of a deal. Sometimes learning to listen well is more important than analytics and stuff like that. Data comes handy as a tool for decision making, but it should never be the driving force, else your games will just feel hollow and dead.
---
The best way to know a game is to play it at a dedicated level, and to be part of the community. That's all you really need, data can help you polish it, but it will never help you make the actual game fun.
---
You know there's dozens of rifts across the world, right? Each zone has multiple of them, you don't visit 1/5 of them during that achievement.
---
It's pretty logic to think there was, at some point, an achievement to discover and visit them all.
---
&gt; ANet is making us fight progressively stronger dragons.
---
This could be chalked up to spectacle creep. But also it fits within the lore that killing one only strengthened the others. Now with Aurene, that vicious cycle could be undone.
---
Plus, the community has made it pretty clear that we miss smaller-scale story arcs and threats that are less eldritch in nature. Who knows how they'll handle the future?
---
&gt; Primordus is also the largest of the elder dragons which make him the oldest.
---
This is pretty unfounded. What we see in-game is not inherently canon as far as size goes. The technology available to ANet and their creative implementations to present the Elder Dragons has changed a ton over the years. Primordus is depicted as much larger in GW2 than he was in GW1, and even Kralkatorrik had models of varying sizes between his debut in PoF to the LS4 finale. Even then, there's no reason for us to believe that size is directly proportionate to age.
---
What we do know is that Primordus was the first to wake up in this cycle, and has been regarded as the most powerful because he has had the longest amount of time to gather magic.
---
I will agree with you that Primordus is likely the last Elder Dragon we'll fight, though. He isn't like the others that corrupt and find themselves limited to certain boundaries. He is the very rock beneath our feet, unfeeling flames that seek not to conquer, but purely to destroy.
---
It's that unwavering goal and that type of power that I think makes him the most dangerous.
---
we've had enough fire for now so i'm guessing its jormag, but we also know primordus is his weakness so we could use that. but we still need replacement for jormag (and after that how we deal with primordus if jormag was his only weakness?)
---
U have no idea, what ranger is
---
Albino* broccoli
---
Also once you're geared and ready there are training discords like [Raid Academy](https://discord.gg/mpVnEju) that teach all the raid encounters.
---
I already use Fireworks runes, so the speed is no biggie.
---
Racist broccoli?
---
Idk, I went by this https://m.imgur.com/r/Guildwars2/5ZqsmbE for size guide. Those are models from Anet I believe. Primordius is on the far right with krak next to him.
---
What happened now?
---
I agree - stepping into Heart of Thorns maps feels so dangerous. I remember my first time in there, I was killed by pocket raptors... the smallest, weakest mobs! That set the tone and the difficulty of the dragon minions made me feel like Mordremoth was intensely powerful and strong - his battle was also epic, along with the story that went with it where the Sylvari became their own enemy. I just loved it! Path of Fire and it’s accompanying living story doesn’t feel quite so epic. 
---
I hope that if we do get another dragon, it feels like how mordremoth did!
---
&gt;There's currently a good balance between double Chrono and FB/Ren comps with double Chrono still being more prevalent more because it took them so many years to address the issue than anything else.  
---
  
---
I don't think this is strictly true any more. The changes have been in place for months. In 5 man content where it's straight up better we've seen higher adoption rates. But in 10 man squads, FB/Ren is only equal to 2Chrono on paper. In reality makes fights harder for the supports while not really offering more utility. That's why adoption rates have been slower there.
---
&gt;Making core Mesmer more appealing by gutting Chrono just makes the game less fun.  
---
This is 100% how I feel about the engineer changes too. Taking away Scrapper F5 and Holo Toolbelt isn't going to increase the play of base engineer, because the only way to play base engineer in instanced content is piano engineer.  
---
They're taking out the things people like about their classes and giving nothing in return. Worse, these balance changes aren't affecting certain specs that remain best in slot while fucking those that were already struggling to hold their place in meta.
---
It's a meme at this point but this is how thinly traded markets behave.  Without a lot of action it is easy to make prices jump, and because trading is so thin it can take a while to correct.
---
Thread removed: Posting exploits is not allowed here, please report them to exploits@arena.net
---
Oh god.. those need updated too. I wish the bounty sets would rotate all the mobs instead of dividing it among tiers.
---
Well, it can be used for many things other mounts can do, but it's still faster to jump over canyons with a raptor, and go up a set of steps laid out vertically with the springer.
---
But if you've got to get to some spot that's both too far for springer and too high for raptor, diagonally, the skyscale has you covered.  
---
And using the barell roll four times in a rowwith Bond of Vigor  after taking off  is so satisfying.
---
&gt; We already have weekly guild activities : ~~guild missions.~~ weeping and rolling on the floor on the prospect of yet another painful session of mediocre content with mediocre rewards.
---
Fixed that for you.
---
&gt;Endless Combat Kodan Tonic
---
Cool are there any other combat Tonics  in the game?
---
iirc the Flame Legion worships destroyers now.
---
What exactly explains what?
---
Isn't it written on every single post of this tool that it WILL increase RAM usage?
---
He doesn't do anything. It's a lot like the Pact assault on Mordremoth - all the action happens off-screen before we arrive.
---
Joko's story primarily takes place between GW1 and GW2. That's where he rises to power, that's where he supresses the Sunspears and begins to rule all of Elona. By the time we arrive in Elona, Joko is chained up in the Underworld and he doesn't reappear until Season 5 where he only lasts three episodes.
---
ArenaNet never sold the Joko invasion of the rest of Tyria, so Joko just sort of comes off as a meme villain who's primary accomplishments take place before our part of the story begins. Joko was in the story for less time that many minor NPCs and he impacted the story less than them.
---
The scale of Joko's story arc is way too small. I don't need him to be running around for three seasons putting his finger in every pie like Scarlet did, but it would have been nice for Joko to accomplish _something_ major while he was still around instead of being a walking meme before being eaten.
---
Quick question. Does anybody currently use YoloMouse? 
---
Is it safe to use? Against TOS?
---
Please link this idea on a previous post.
---
there's big changes in the way you roam, did you look at the scheduled pathing at the bottom of the page ?
---
I don't personally use it but I know many that do, it is safe to use since it doesn't interact with the game in any way.
---
I'm not sure what use a trailblazer mirage is in blobbing.  Yes, you can veil and do Illusion of life but no grav well.  If you want cc pull then you need to run focus which is not useful on mirage.  And condi mirage in a blob is going to do any siginificant dps anyway since condi gets insta cleansed by any vaguely competent enemy zerg.
---
No, a chrono will still be 1 skill more useful than a mirage but both will be nothing more than cc/veil/illusion bots.  The rest of the time you'll be pressing buttons pretending like it's doing something.  Unfortunately, careful use of veils can still completely turn the tide of an otherwise evenly matched blob fight so unless a viable alternative pops up, coms will still want chronos even if no one wants to play them anymore.
---
I've looked into so many forums on this it's ridiculous. Really bad pings when plugged in every ~5 sec. Fps drops to single digits. Sucky, but I can't find a solution that actually works for my system
---
To be fair... Those fuckers come in packs of 5-8, hit like trucks, and Dodge away.
---
The answer to this is both yes and no. Yes, it is possible to complete almost if not all the raid encounters without an optimal team comp, or even one close to an optimal comp. However, as you would expect, having closer to the optimal comp, having high dps from your dps, etc does make all the encounters far easier than they would otherwise be. In general, if you are doing between 10-15k dps and not screwing up mechanics, 90% of the time no one will care. On the other hand, most of the people who complain about raids being toxic, elitist and so on are simply not pulling anywhere close to their expected weight and are screwing up mechanics, which obviously angers people and leads them to having a shitty time.
---
The only pay2win in this game are the expansions which are a onetime purchase. You get access to elite specs and more gear stats choice which may be considered pay2win.
---
But, you also get a tons of QoL stuff like autoloots, gliders, mounts etc. So overall it is just good to have.
---
Everything else is purely for cosmetics and convenience. 
---
Overall this is one of the least pay2win out there.
---
No, WvW is a dead game mode.
---
You should be farming world bosses and buying more gems!
---
~ ANET
---
Above al else you have to be good at your class and it’s mechanics. Do you do much instanced PvP? That’s a much better place to practice against other players just cause you spend so much more time fighting. And the fights come pretty close to mimicking your typical roaming fights (1v1s, small gang fights, fighting outnumbered)
---
Also be sure you’re wearing a full set of exotic gear. You can buy it off the trading post. Ascended CS exotic is only like 5% increase so it’s far from mandatory.
---
I'm in that small guild category.
---
&gt; lethality acts as a definitive amount of damage - despite the amount toughness the enemy has.
---
All damaging condis ignore toughness.
---
I’ve been playing on exotic berserker gear for both my power classes. I don’t do much PVP though - it scares me with the stuff about people being nasty and toxic.
---
I've only had a eGPU for a while... And was sad at how bad it seemed to work with GW2. Going to have to give this a try next weekend.
---
If you folks are on a US server, hit me up in game on Vayne.8563. I help a lot of people learn the game.
---
I want a normal villain, that doesn't tie into anything related to the elder dragons. Maybe something like the Charr and the Fire Legion.
---
I want a season that deals with brushing up and breathing new life into previous maps and characters. New NPC dialog in Lion Arch and main cities that realize the growth of the world and the troubles it faced could help.
---
I want to delve into a story about Charr, Norn, and Asuran specific issues. Even if its a side story kinda deal;  something to branch off the main story.
---
I want to explore older races that don't see any plot lines, like the Kodan, Tengu, Largos and Quaggan. The Kodan show up in Bitterfrost Frontier, but they don't really get much of a spotlight. They are just there, to me. I want an actual character with dialog that I can go on a journey with.  
---
I want to see certain races that I know have intelligence and personalities break out and grow from just being somewhat mindless creatures that we kill all the time like Harpies, Centaurs, Ogre, Ettin, Dredge, and Jotun. I would love to fight along side with any of these races and see how the mingle with "superior" races.
---
Interesting point of view I’m gonna try that see how it works
---
Nah we're going after the deep sea dragon, Steve.
---
This is the worst way possible, the new maps and legendary collections work that way and it only helps till large part of community do it, after that the maps are dead again in most cases when they finish that collections. This is good for peak not for constant influx of player for content.
---
Wanna make dungeons revelant again, change loot tables there is a tone of shit there that nobody needs, maybe add ascendand trader for dung tokens also (with right prices cuz dungeons are super easy right now, but not that boring usless grandmaster tokens) it is not that hard, but it turns out it is for Anet.
---
But real reason why dungeons can't be fixed, if players start to do it again there will be chatter to do new dungeon, and they can't have that, that is why they are dead. 
---
They have hard time to do raid in year. And last two fractals are like... maybe we don't talk about that... 
---
If Season 5 don't fix some of core problems of GW2 there will be nothing left.
---
No thanks, don't really care, don't need some rando asshat halfassing the dying game modes anyway.
---
First of, ouch 
---
Second of, this game used to be my life but lately it’s been feeling empty and I need help getting back into it. I posted that just to see what people are going to say maybe something I forgot about or missed while autopilottig the game for past couple of months
---
Don’t.
---
Sheesh
---
There is no need.
---
If you leave, you'll try other games, eventually get bored of them, and eventually you'll see some news or content release of GW2, and come back.
---
Don't uninstall, and you'll save time when the time comes.
---
[Dagger trait hasn't needed a dagger to be equipped for the movement speed buff for 9 months now.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Quickening_Thirst)
---
The answer still applies. Why force yourself to play a game you don't enjoy anymore? Find a new hobby and come back when you're ready to play again.
---
Nope thats only possible with gw2hook. And tbh it's not that much of a difference. I used gw2hook for that purpose only for a long time but it's worth switching now imho
---
* Fighting Aurene would be completely out of character for Zojja.  
---
She worked alonside Snaff and Glint. They were comrades. They were allies. Losing snaff hit her harder than losing Glint, but she also felt the loss. Killing her daughter would be unthinkable.  
---
And she would not be uninformed of recent developments. Taimi's science records are sounds. She would have all the data.  
---
* As much as I'd like to see the missing Malyck story finally done, I don't think they'll go back there. Ideally it would have been a 5th map in HoT, but they ran out of time. I'd want to have S1 before going back to that.  
---
* About Cantha we can only dream. I would personally love to see several Kaineng city maps, full of skyscrappers, slums and sewers as far as the eye can see, like in the artwork. Reminiscent of massive cities like in Blade Runner and the Fifth Element, and even Coruscant in Star Wars.  
---
 * https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kaineng_City#Gallery  
---
 * And of course Echoval revived, full of giant trees.  
---
 * Maybe we could even get a new "Grappling Hook" mastery to use between the buildings and the trees. It could be equipped as a new type of "Tool" novelty. And then combine it with gliding to go [Batman](https://youtu.be/DJB__LxxYMo) on this thing.
---
* As for Joko, my dream way to get him back permanently would be making him part of Halloween.
---
 * For example, they could have a 3rd Halloween Side Story. We have the one about compiling the Mad Memoires back, so the one about sealing the Bloody Prince would return, and they would add a third one in which we go to the Land of the Lost, capture Joko's soul, trap him in a device provided by the a servant of the Mad King, and bring it to the Mad Realm. From them on, every year Joko would return in Halloween alonside the Mad King, and he would try to escape and we'd keep him from running away so he gets trapped in the Mad Realm again for another year.
---
True but it's been many years since it shut, also the server code is floating around meaning literally anyone could host they're own server. Characters are also backed up
---
There's no reason right now. You'd just be repeating the same content you've already done for years. Wait until they bring out something new or exciting that you want to jump into and do on your own volition.
---
I doubt you have any goals to set to do, unless you are an achievement hunter or working towards legendaries everything else boils down to some variation of farming money. 
---
Some people continue to play it for the dead WvW and PvP. Raid LFG and statics/discords are bleeding players. Fractals are losing quality players. Open world is doing okay it seems. Many are waiting for season 5 announcement to see whether it'll be a GW2 2.0 moment or a steady decline towards maintenance mode.
