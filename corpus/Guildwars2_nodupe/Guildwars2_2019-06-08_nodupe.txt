would buy gems to get a nice tanktop/t-shirt and trousers/pants for heavy female. like holy shit its all bulky disgusting things and the only decent looking ones if you're going for lighter theme are aether/phalanx and arah dung.. damn life is hard as a heavy class main if you dont want to look like a bulky warrior.
---
And even though he has been making his money off of betting you survive you will need to pay top dollar for everything there

One of - if not the - most powerful boon ingame is disappointing? Well ether you heavily underestimate the potential of this boon because you are absolutely new to this game or you are such a veteran (in gaming general) that you will most likely not find a single game mechanic that will impress you.
---
I love personally: blue cosmic skin, purple outline from 2018 Halloween, and black Halloween! If you do it right, the black darkens the cosmic, then cosmic has blue outline, and the purple outlines gear in a similar shade. Looks REALLY nice! I got some photos somewhere if you want to see it

You will get round about 50-60 silver per box on average. If that is good to you depends on your possibilies. For most players that is a fortune - especially compared to the effort it takes with most metas atm.

Not terrible, no. HORRIBLE!!

With the elder dragons out of the way I would absolutely be down for some more ridiculous side stories. Bring on CanachCorp!
---
Tried to read in canach, didn't quite flow/feel right. 8/10 excellent idea though
---
I was I had been there for that. Couldn't they just have lowered the damage on it? Communal defenses only procs every 15 seconds anyway, and using that specialization at all means some serious dps loss. Feels like a no-crit solution was a poor choice in general.

I was really happy that I got the one infusion particle effect that you couldn't get through gold. (Unless you cheated/exploited)

It's really nice, and subtle too. I wish I could share it across my characters.

With the amount he's won and this apparent chip on his shoulder, why not just buy a controlling stake in the Consortium and bully their leadership team Carl Icahn-style?  Now THAT I'd like to see.
---
Don't worry, I always get those things wrong too. :D
---
I probably picture it that way because that was exactly how it was presented. I haven't gone through the HoT story since its release, so I forgot all about that.

These are horrible suggestions.

I believe you just have to participate in one meta event before Tuesday.
---
That's actually the same question. The builds that are best for soloing dungeons are also the ones that do the highest amount of damage in the shortest amount of time.
---
I don't know why you are downvoted. I totally agree.
---
1 like = 1 prayer for the tormented soul of our good friend Ipos Hookgill
---
I agree. Although I would say PvP is pretty balanced at moment, it does feel like it's balanced by making everything powercrept and OP.
---
Tbh powercreep, especially support power creep, is an issue in raids as well. Thing is people don't mind them being much easier and the bosses ain't gonna complain that players are OP.
---
I mean, I’ve got a T-shirt, sports hat, sports shades, and cute mascot backpack.  It’s certainly not something that they haven’t done before.  There’s a lot of modern day clothing in the game
---
You want me to read the traits and skills of every class? and "Remember!" then all?! :S.... :O

thx!

Yet it got a Silver and your comment will be most likely downvoted for oblivion. Seen people who actually put a lot more effort into their video projects getting way less attention than a mere compilation of official trailers and cutscenes.

I use GW2EnhancedLauncher.  Super simple.  It just works.  Keeps arc updated (and templates if you want) and can also remove Arc.

Played my first WVW about 15 minutes ago and was trying to fight this guy and he ran behind a wall I couldn't see behind then next thing I know literally 50 motha fuckas hop out from behind this wall and I no longer play WVW.
---
We do 1 region per month right now so next month most likely!
---
Are there any obvious draw backs from this method? Could use a ELI5
---
Oh that. I didn't know the crafting proccess so I didn't realize you needed to actually bind an "ipos" for the legendary to come into existence, I get it now, thanks.
---
It's definitely not you, I've seen other people have this issue and they always have to explain "no, I haven't done it yet today, this is the first time, this is literally the first time I can do this event today, I participated in all three rounds and got plenty of hits on the Pinata, I got event credit but no hero's choice chest". I've not seen anything over in the bugs forum yet. 
---
While this isn't super helpful, just wanted to let you know you're not alone. Maybe open a thread in the bug forum, and again, stress the point that this is the first time doing it after reset, because people will just try to shrug you off telling you you must have done it and forgot.
---
Indeed but I’d like all nodes to be worth farming as you see them. I basically ignore all Harvesting nodes which is a shame because they have the highest variety.

It's no worse really than griffon. And just as useful , for some players. Initially everyone was like "it sucks" but as more people get it and see what it's about, they realize it's pretty sweet.

Yeah.,.. was going to say this. One full meta run of Dragonfall with a booster filled every mastery, was reasonably rewarding and progressed all of the achievements there.

Lol sorry, I was looking up good ways to get karma for those backpieces the other day xD

Interesting, thanks for sharing.

I'm sure a natively developed client would be more efficient though.

One thing I’ve noticed is the mobs in Jahai rifts work with the stamina sigil (refill endurance on every kill). Throw one on a GS mirage for beam spam. Bring one on a condi asura daredevil for more flips and daggers than a teppankayi restaurant.

I don't understand why I'm getting down voted so hard for just sharing my looks 😂 oh well
---
And that's your opinion.
---
But I like shiny and I like glowy
---
I don't know either. I know they can be pricey, so maybe that's a little off-putting? After playing this game since launch, working toward strange infusions and character looks is enticing to me, haha.
---
I am one of these players. Love my aura's.... and don't care what anyone else likes or doesn't. Life is too short to live it to appease everyone around you.  
---
IMO? Glow all you want. &lt;3
---
I've played HoT all along and it's always been fun to me. Glad you're having a good time.
---
Why though? This is fantasy world, correct? I don't understand the hatred toward it. If you can stack them, who really cares? Can you not just look at someone else? If someone wants to use infusions to make their toon look like "shit," does it really concern you?
---
The easiest solution i could think of is to semi regularly take mats that are far too undervalued and make a regular sink with the mystic forge, daily need to drop 40k of a mat into the forge for a higher chance of rare rewards (raise by 10% or so). This would give a reason to drop a ton of mats regularly for people as well as lowering the number of rare/exotic weapons in the tp as people try for rarer skins that sell for a lot.

As a player with physical limitations... it always hurts my heart to read comments in these threads by people who are always trying to be exclusionary because it will affect 'their' fun and challenge. Ugh. Just my minor rant. Accessibility issues has been a hot topic in the disabled gamers world recently. It just hurts my soul to read people being so short sighted. 
---
I'm glad ANet is doing something they feel will improve the experience for everyone involved. I haven't even gotten to this step to know if I could tackle it or not. But I digress. Good on you ANet for thinking about it and not being afraid to make adjustments based on feedback.
---
Thank the lords everyone moved over to discord.

I felt like TS wanted you to verify every week or some bs.
---
If only these boxes did a roulette to increase chances of exotic drop per x count of opens. For instance, open 10 boxes for a 100% chance for an exotic etc. Let's also mention that the science and chances of these loot boxes are F-cking low to get the ones you actually want, Anet does not even list the percentages distribution of loot drop (which is actually illegal in most countries that practice fairness of full disclosure, otherwise gambling). The least they do is implement a sure chance of a certain drop that way people will be rewarded enough to press on to the next meta or boss... cuz seriously not even 6g an hour is absurd... Like get on a static raid, clear at least 3 wings and you make more in an hour or a simple t4 fracs speed run makes more than 6g surely that takes shorter than an hour. Let's admit it's a design failure.
---
I just got it yesterday by doing 1 meta and switching maps.
---
I'm also very worried!!
---
That was banned???
---
&gt;Af
---
C'mon are we in grade school and the teacher brings around a yard stick?
---
I'm on all maps pretty much all the time. They're not really unpopulated. They're not zerged either of course, but I don't need a zerg to enjoy the game. Most of the time, I can call out events and get people there.
---
The question I guess is what you can't do now that you think repopulating those maps would get you.
---
In the last week I've done both Bloodstone Fen and Ember Bay. Bitterfrost is always busy, but I'm up to that next.  Last week I was in Lake Doric on my second account and got everything done I tried to do.
---
Just not sure the maps are underpopulated enough to make changes at this point.
---
Damn cute. Would be nice to see some new life forms in gw2 that are friendly.
---
There's a reason why I turn off avatar details to the default generic models, may not work as well for auras but it at least helps a lot.
---
Yeah I figure, all legendaries have those little bits of lore don't they? Pretty sure some of them even have a little "ingame" aspect like chuka and chumpwat with the little baby tigers.
---
Yeah, but you're pointing at them and noticing them when you otherwise wouldn't.
---
So goal accomplished.
---
I'm not.
---
I would say that rare and super rare does not have a drop rate at all and its there just as bait.
---
How does /gg make SAB easier?

I actually agree with you, we'll unpin the question thread and make a link in the top to it instead.

I was expecting something revolutionary but only got a trailblaizer's necromancer using scourge and parasitic contagion on a condition build.  It functions as advertised, though.

...and then you realise someone’s streaming on twitch
---
Because reddit is one big circlejerk usually. Becomes pretty clear when you see the subs 'anti-everything that's not faceroll open world' or 'muh immersion' crowd.
---
I'd like to add, the world boss bonus box ISN'T even once per day, it always drops, even if you repeat an event. I've been farming maw for portal spiker (my last PoF achievement) and got a drop every time. only the hero's choice reward is daily gated.
---
There is a huge amount of downvoting going on in this thread that seems against the spirit of the subreddit. My guess is that people that don't like raiding are downvoting everything. People that want a thread for first kills, even though the game doesn't support progress raiding and previous "races" have been marred with both bugs and favouritism, are downvoting anyone pointing out that being able to report bugs is of more importance.
---
I think the strangest argument I've seen in this thread is someone honestly arguing that the raiding community gets hyped over the existence of first kill *threads*. No, we get hyped over good raid content, a thread for first kills adds nothing to that since the size and style of raid releases doesn't support raid progress competition.
---
I'm playing Victory or Die right now but it's really late and I'm starting to get pretty tired. If I stop playing right now, will it restart me all the way at the beginning of the entire thing (meeting Caithe at Cursed Shore)? Or will it remember some of my progress?
---
This community was like that since the beta and may it never change \o/
---
some dungeons have stuff that needs to be done simultaneously by by multiple people. CoF p1 with the braziers is an example, but some of these can be worked around (in CoF you can port past the trigger point for the event).
---
but a fair few of dungeons are soloable in theory. I think the easiest way to start out is to just search for videos of solo paths. if there's a vid, it is or at least was possible. 
---
if a new player with limited experience will be able to solo them however is another question all together.
---
Too bad making the Binding of Ipos does not solve the problem of being tight on cash.
---
Which one is endless tonic or the friendship?
---
Do I have it wrong in mind that the Chak-Infusion buffs walking speed?
---
Such rewards already exist.
---
&gt; any ideas on how to repopulate the old maps?
---
Why do you think they need to be repopulated? There must be some other problem you want to solve, which you think is caused by low pop, and once you let us know, we can tell you why this is not the case.

They mean, not working on Astralaria

You will want ascended trinkets if you plan on doing fractals. "ascended"  (pink) is the second top quality of gear in the game below "legendary" (purple). Legendary gear is very hard to get and has the same stats as ascended. Trinkets are amulets, rings, and accessories. If you don't plan on doing fractals, then exotic (orange) gear will generally be good enough.
---
The story will have some strange jumps if you skip LW seasons, they definitely do bridge the gap. The way it worked is that LW2 introduced the big bad of HoT, and LW3 introduced the big bad of PoF (especially in the PoF case, many NPCs around the core tyria cities spoil that anyway). If you skip, you will be fighting an enemy which your character and the NPCs seems to know about already, but you will have not heard of. You'll work it out soon enough though, it's just a weird story jump, nothing major.
---
As for what's "normal", I can't really say. Story driven players will play in order, other players want to get to fractals/raids, gearing up, and unlocking masteries/mounts as fast as possible and will speed through and skip story to get there. The second group will probably only unlock specific episodes just to get access to certain maps. Totally up to you.
---
same here, just now. Can't get in
---
as if anet fixes bugs LMAO
---
&gt;Normal mode kills will be quick and inconsequential, CMs will fall to the groups that target them first
---
That's never happened.
---
i timed it..took like 1h5min with enrichment, guild buff, exp booster(no laurel or the black lion one)
---
would it have worked as a tonic if you didnt add it to your wardrobe?
---
Most legendaries don't really have any lore at all, just themes. Well, there is one lore they all have: All legendary gear is actually created by Zomorros via the Mythwright Cauldron. He designed them, and exchanges the gear for certain items. We're technically not crafting the final weapon, armor, backpiece, or trinket but exchanging a similarly-designed piece of gear with fancy, expansive items for it.
---
That said, some of those legendary equipment that Zomorros makes are modeled after items of legendary lore - such as the Claw of the Khan-Ur, Eternity, Frostfang, Verderarch, and The Shining Blade. While Chuka and Champawat is, apparently, designed after the two tigers we hunt down in the first collection; similarly Frostfang is designed after Jormag's greatest dragon champion that was slain by Aesgir (the norn who knocked out Jormag's tooth).
---
big true. support power creep only makes it less fun for those who are there looking for a challenge. id rather have raids easy mode then OP support. anet with another bandaid ‘solution’
---
Oh fuck yes. One of the best songs of all time and it fits perfectly with the story of this GW2 season. And ou even made some animations ynch up perfectly with the music. Awesome!
---
Yeah that’s almost where I’m lost is the gear. Like where do I even start or in this case I guess it would be “where do I pick up”. I don’t even know where I would go to start getting my gear back up to speed
---
Fun fact: Ipos isn't the only reference to the Key of Solomon in GW.
---
http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vassago
---
Also, just because they're referencing something historical or in our literature, doesn't mean it's a sneaky way to connect Tyria to Earth and make GW some alternate reality. Abaddon, Balthazar, Lyssa, Zhaitan, Jormag, Ascalon, and Orr are all some form of obvious historical reference.
---
&gt; It's 2019, there's no Excuse for this game to still be running on DirectX9

Do you know their engine? If they could easily upgrade do dx11 they probably would have, they also said it would not make much difference because the engine has other limitations which can´t be resolved by changing to dx11 or dx12

---
1. Get the raptor mount from the start of PoF story
---
2. Work towards an elite specialisation (either through completing the new maps and story, or whatever floats your boat). As you're learning the playstyle and want to stick with it, research it to find look up ideal gear and skills
---
How can I find guilds that are dedicated to FotM and raids?
---
It's a bit of a desesperate question but I guess it is a no but there is no way of transforming a light armor into a medium one ?
---
Because I spent HOURS to get the collection of dragon's stand to finish my ascended armor. And by choosing too fast, I got the light pants instead of medium so I lost a lot of hours into that.
---
I didn't find it jarring. I thought if she was to come back they chose the best place to do it. I know that I'm in the minority on this one however but I'd like to explain why this the case.
---
Arenanet set out her character arc as "She had to die to grow stronger and eventually ascend". The choices are 'When she dies', 'When she comes back' and 'How she comes back'. They've quite clearly chosen her death to be the penultimate episodes cliff hanger. This works well as an 'end' point to the episode and a major suspense builder for the community. It'll generate a lot of word of mouth promotion as it tugs on the emotional attachment strings build up in the season. So now that they've made this decision they have one episode to bring her back. Past this episode and the season would be far too long. Her story is this season and her story has to conclude this season and therefore if she is still dead going into season 5 then any Resurrection that subsequently happens would be underwhelming and feel a lot like she is being brought back for solving a future plot. So where in episode 6? Remember GW2 episodes don't span across a long period of time and are very short sections of story, almost like short films if you will. With eternal doom on the horizon for our characters it's fitting to hold a sort of 'funeral' for Aurene as they and us the audience are still in the mourning stage of the story. Remember the Commander and others had NO PLANS of how to precede and had already admitted defeat in Tyria to Kralk. The Resurrection is needed early on to kickstart the events that lead to bringing down Kralk and kickstart the entire episode. By having Aurene come in at a later time in the episode would feel very forced and, again, like they are saving Aurene for that one moment where she comes in and helps save the day. The second half of the season has been all about Aurene and Kralk and I honestly don't think the episode could have been written much differently and to the same effect if they had kept Aurene dead for much longer than she was. I accept people don't feel like this was a satisfying moment in the story but for me personal once broken down, I can't see it happening in another way.

If you care about story, work through it in order HoT&gt; LW3&gt; PoF &gt; LW4
---
If you don't care or not too much, then play Pof until at least you get the Springer mount before you play HoT. (although Id quickly play the first episode of HoT for the glider.
---
The mount in WvW is a reward track.  And most people play elite of the classes, the core classes are generally weaker.
---
Welcome back to the game!
---
I lose maybe 2-5 FPS with it personally. I have GTX 960 2GB so not terribly powerful ( gw2hook doesnt affect CPU afaik)
---
Many Thanks. I heard about RIBA recently. How long is 1 run approx? Nevermind I'll just check the videos you gave me. :)
---
About the low levels apparently they're less relevant now with changes made to items or something? Maybe in the interest of min maxing..
---
Will have to look at it :)

Can we add /cringe ?
---
This doesn't mean what you think it means, and I wish people would stop spreading it.
---
He's just referring to constant hidden XP bar that gives you spirit shards. This happens no matter what mastery you have.
---
He's not referring to the extra XP bar (the spirit shard "mastery").
---
You still lose 50% of your spirit shard gain when capped.
---
I was curious about that idea myself.
---
When I first played the map and saw herI wondered if it was setup so she only appeared at one place on the map at a time so it would seem like shes helping out all pver the place.
---
I wonder what circumstances they set her to. Like if she came to you specifically because you needed help.
---
Start with pof and unlock the mounts. Gain xp and unlock the first 3 masteries for raptor, springer, skimmer, jackal, griffon. 
---
If you dont mind being spoilt by the story, you can also do War eternal story to unlock skyscale. Once you have all the mounts, you can enjoy exploring, or go to heart of thorns to work on gliding.
---
And that would still have made for a great cliffhanger.
---
What class can benefit from the Wanderer stat? Regardless of play context (open, pve,pvp etc)
---
If I'm making ascended minstrel's armor and want to get the most use out of it across classes, which is the best investment? light/medium/heavy? Primarily WvW and maybe future raid use.
---
Togo was somewhat useful, he would at least cast Spirit Rift every now and then.
---
Now, GW2's NPCs in personal story, that's uselessness at its best. They hardly do any damage, they do not have any debuff, support or CC skills, and they won't even  try to revive you if you go down.
---
/r/subsididntfellfor
---
Subterfuge at its finest
---
Charr have 5 fingers in their hands. The hand from the binding of Ipos has 4. So what's trapped in the book is likely a powerful dark demon like [The Greater Darkness](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Greater_Darkness).
---
What makes it your game? I just wanna see my character floss!
---
play fortnite or some shit if you want to see ur char flossing
---
You don't. It's a late Gen 2 legendary. So it doesn't have a collection. It's all just materials and legendary shards.
---
Exotic zerk gear is fine for a WvW warrior, but you're going to be a little bit squishy. Many warriors use mauraders (zerk with some vitality) in WvW.
---
As for builds, Spellbreaker is very good in largescale fights, and Berserker is better in small scale. However, warrior is pretty versatile in WvW so you could easily play each spec in either large or small scale.
---
Head to metabattle for the traits and skills.
---
And tiny legs.
---
To bad every other npc are useless. Friendly patrols really need to be upgraded. For example 3 fully armed and professionally trained seraph in queensdale dying to two wolfs.
---
Oh, that's interesting. I figured it would always be more efficient to crit-cap, but I guess with lower power from the Diviner gear, additional power from Zerker gear is more effective than it usually is.
---
For wvw it's mainly firebrand, tempest and scrapper, with spellbreaker, herald/renegade and chronomancer as decent choices as well.
---
In pve it's rarely needed, but when it is, it's used on tanks so basically chrono and eventually fb (tank) or herald (deimos kiter). You can use it in fractals on any healer, but it's usually overkill unless the group is really bad and you need to facetank through reviving.
---
how do you even come to it to use stow weapon lel 
---
and why did the devs not use something like /sleep some other tonics have....
---
If a dps player is doing 10k less dps than they're supposed to, people start to look at them funny. Playing full minstrel on chrono instead of the zerker/diviner mix is cutting your dps from \~11k to \~3k, and chrono has more than enough evades and invulnerabilities between offhand sword and shield to never die, even on full berserker.
---
Normally there will always be a few people to help, but with the meta event going, these maps are way more active than they have been since pre HoT.... I can only imagine the swarm of help you got. XD
---
Yeah. I'm not too hyped for most of the daggers from that legendary, but I really like the first one you can craft.
---
I wish they went back to the "experiment" and "perfected" skins and reworked into proper skins like these instead just ruined versions of old, bland skins and repeats of named exotics.
---
For example, the The Hunter Experiment could be a Perfect Rifle without the scope.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
All gear pieces share the same amount of stats based on their rarity, regardless of where you get them.
---
But that power does shine, the same chrono build does 3k with full minstrel and 11k with the meta setup of berserker/diviner. If a dps class did 8k less than the generally accepted pug numbers, people wouldn't want them.
---
You can, but as I said, it's counterproductive since you're lacking a lot of damage output to gain defense that you dont even need.
---
I don't care what he did or didn't do, show us 8+ gold from Ire .\_.
---
I'm a bit sad that it wasn't real.
---
They actually fixed this, it used to be more broken, but now you can actually see trait names listed, and if you mouse over utilities you see their names
---
It's still annoying, but the site was unusable a week or so ago, but they changed the way traits are displayed so it shows names
---
Almost all GW1 NPCs were pretty useful when compared to gw2 PS ones. My guild and I once played through Ruins of Surmia HM, exclusively by putting enchantments on Rurik, letting him kill all foes on the way. Buffing gw2 NPCs... I don't think such things would work or at least not be very fun.
---
Ah, the Pharoah's Serpent. The name (and it's colour) always give me more of a desert vibe, but I can appreciate the resemblance.
---
Hey now, when I put swiftness on them they get out of my way a lot faster.
---
Kormir would at least buff you and didn't (usually) put herself in much danger.
---
If you have berserker gear then its not outdated. You can use that to transition to a better set without a problem.
---
*in Thanos voice*  
---
Everything.
---
Volatile magic run does have a cap and it's not enough to level up all three masteries.
---
I think she comes around when you're by yourself or in a small group.
---
Other than Aurene, there's also that woman with the rifle (I totally forgot her name at the moment but was a follower of Balthazarr) who'll appear and help you out by sniping enemies.
---
It was a joke. Not a penis. Maybe try to not shove it up your bum and you won't be so stuck up.
---
One option is to change the key for it I guess, not sure if anything else can be done, but maybe someone else knows
---
As for the items, I think the collection is their only use
---
In story instances Aurene is also really good about reviving you if you fall. Better than any other story NPC, honestly. She’ll even revive any friends you bring along.
---
Fortnite is a bad game though
---
I can do that with ease, but since there's a bloody event on which affects the rewards from Ire, you're just going to bitch about that if I post it now.
---
Sure, I'm looking forward to following it on a number of different discords while attempting the raid myself and I'd have been following it on any thread created here. That doesn't mean I think a first kill thread needs to be pinned, nor am I excited about the thread itself. It is the content and wider discussion that I'm looking forward to.  
---
Variable compositions used is a different subject than first kills though imo. The different compositions are interesting but that involves more than just the first kills of each boss / CM. It is why I argued for a general raid thread to be pinned instead of a raid kill thread but going by the downvotes that was an unpopular opinion.
---
If you include a wp link people will surely come.
---
Rasmans infusions were neither expensive nor super shiny.
---
I swear I've seen Rasman rocking the shiny stuff
---
As others have stated no fee, full version comes with purchasing ether of the explanations.  There are micro transactions, nothing pay to win and nothing that is essential.  Most micro transactions are for skins but some are for convenience/utilities.  Some of the utilities are not worth it where others are very very nice but not essential.  There are also loot boxes but they are mostly skins or utilities and everything (other than maybe a few skins) is available with out doing the loot boxes.

Awwww you found my baby pictures!
---
Really ?!?! That is utter garbage when you compare it to Resistance, Quickness or Alacrity any of these blow Aegis out of the water. Aegis is so easily counter I can't even understand your reasoning "one hit and its down, unblockable totally ignores it so HOW CAN YOU EVEN REMOTELY JUSTIFY THAT IT'S OVERPOWERED!
---
The smartest way to go about with specific encounters it is using 'side-fight's.
---
For example, adding extra hostile NPCs that are hard to kill by you, but easy for them, and your allies focus on those, while you get specific enemies marked with swords that will focus on you.
---
Another example of 'side-fight' is when allies stay behind guard the door while enemy waves come while you fight a boss.
---
In Diablo III, right before fighting Diablo in story they made it so your followed is trapped in a cage and forced to stay behind. How much better would have been if instead a bunch of demons cam from behind and a weakened Imperius appeared to hold them off, and your follower decided to also stay behind and help?
---
Side-fights will not work well with filler roaming enemies scattered through an instance, tho. For those it's better just to let NPCs hit just as hard as players and be done with it.
---
-&gt; no monthy fee  
---
-&gt; both xpacs cost extra, but you can buy them in a bundle or in a sale for less when one is up  
---
-&gt; the living story episodes cost extra gems (and therefore can also be bought with gold if you choose to convert your gold to gems ig)  
---
living story works like this: you unlock the lastest living story always for free when you were logged in during the time it got out.  
---
else it will cost you 200 gems per story step or you can buy one completly if its finished already (1280 gems fpr season 2, 960 for season 3....20% off for every story step you may have unlocked already in there throug logging in).
---
I feel like Terry would be a guardian.
---
itcouldattackanywhereeee
---
She seems to show up during events where there are players actively progressing it, she's popped up even when there's a huge group of people and no real chance of failure so I dunno if it's because players needed help, though it's possible maybe if a player's health dips below a certain % it increases the chance she'll show up.  It might be possible to have Aurene show up simultaneously at several points on the same map, not sure if anyone's really tested that.
---
Prices of Quartz Crystal is going up, i have some in the bank, is now the time to sell? I guess Festival of four winds is coming soon?
---
"There is a Spy sapping my Supply!"
---
Subjective. Some may love looking like a sparkler.
---
I was thinking more of the Flash (or the CW verse in general).
---
General Eisling was introduced as an antagonist in season 1 and then we never saw him again after he says "Oh, I know you're the Flash".
---
They mention a missing pilot in season 1 and then Savitar shows up who, in the comics, is purportedly a lost pilot. 
---
They tease Dr McGee, Mercury Labs' owner, dating Henry Allen and then kill him off in the same episode and we never see her again.
---
GW2 has loads of plothooks like this introduced and few are followed up. Like Caudeceus took till LW3E4 to resolve and Malyck just dropped off the face of Tyria. The pressure-cooker environment oftens leaves loose threads like this, more's the pity.
---
&gt;I regularly see people join groups that have literally 1.6k AP and there's no way that they can have the LI requirement for the group.
---
Just a heads up that I know people who have over 1000 Li and around that much AP. It's an alt account that they use only for raids.
---
Not at all. The game is still very easy to get into.
---
Kormir didn't make everyone wipe now and then, unlike Togo and Mhenlo.
---
Same here. Pity some events are a pain and can't be properly soloed.
---
For the most part I've been able to do most things in the game. But there were multiple times across multiple events that a meta would be going on and there just wasn't enough people working on it to ever do it. 
---
Outside of that occasionally happening the game is great and I highly reccomend giving it a shot.
---
Zafirah :p
---
I think the Shining Blade, Exordium and C&amp;C direct precursors are some of the best skins ingame
---
There are so many metas out there at this point of the game that it's very much impossible to populate every single one of them. But if you know where to go and when to go, you'll always find people doing them, even on multiple map instances.
---
GW2 is very much alive, with players everywhere doing nearly everything. You can get into it now just fine, but you'll have a massive amount of content to play at this point in time- that is very overwhelming! But GW2 has a ton of helpful guilds you can join and very helpful people that love to help (too much!). And a very good Wiki you should use all the time.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The Expansions and Living World 2-3-4 are worth getting, imo, that'll give you so much content and item and play value. The story too! xD Totally go get your Raptor and then go back and level from 1 to 80.
---
Now read too much on this post/Reddit and go have fun!
---
anyone else having issues loading trails for farming ruote in thunderhead with this patch?
---
d912pxy saves only failed shaders in that folder
---
Shoutout to all my fellow Tybalt gun users
---
no need. its something to do with the june release. I just put the one  I downloaded in may and it works the trails are there. (I save backups of your rleases)
---
Il just use the old version, ty for your help :)
---
Kill it! Kill it with fire!!!
---
Can’t speak for the others, but Bloodstone Fen is a map I visit daily. 25 blood rubies per day, pretty reliably, 8 flax nodes at the top, various events that I still see groups doing, plus there’s a chance at a Treasure Mushroom. I think there are just too many maps to choose from, and people skip out on some because they have a preference for others, or they do visit each map but not all in the same day.
---
I will double check the code, let's hope the next version will work for you:-)
---
Thank you. I was drawing a complete blank.
---
I agree that i could have worded it to be more likable but that wouldnt change anything about my point anyway and im the advocaate of "harsh truth" or "tough love", sure someone cant handle it but im not here to be liked, im here to state my point and answer to that guys ridiculous statement about wvw.
---
It might have looked like im offended but it really was me being honest, dont like it? Ignore it. What can i say, im not going to pretend that im ok with it while im stating the exact opposite. From where im from, we are not sugarcoating anything.
---
It's most likely due to the meta event rush. Straights is actually populated for once.
---
please Kormir no
---
Which skritt do I need to pickpocket to finally get my extra-shiny auric sliver?!!?!?!!?!?!?!!?
---
^(I'm not bitter.)
---
thanks. means im missing vision
---
Did you release this on its own as well as park of the pack?
---
no sub
---
buy an xpac to upgrade your account
---
the last LW episode unlocks for free and the others cost gems to unlock
---
the gemstore sells cosmetic items and some account upgrades (like extra bank space and character slots) where ppl spend IRL money (but gems can be bought for gold if you want)
---
I haven't played POF yet but do we already have this kind of futuristic NPCs?
---
I've always been sure that Timberline Falls look like Norway and now I'm glad to know that it does. It's my favourite map and I wish I'll travel to Norway someday :D
---
&gt; They hardly do any damage, they do not have any debuff, support or CC skills, and they won't even try to revive you if you go down.
---
Depends on when the mission was made. Sometimes they are completely useless. Other times npc while dealing no dmg at least res you. It really comes down to when the mission was made in the games lifespan.
---
How do you key farm in Dragonfall?
---
Well TacO generates a unique GUID identificator for each marker what can happen is that it will generate the same one in the other pack and that can turn it off. For markers, it happens only if it's in the same map but for trails everywhere. 
---
But in this case when I've closer inspected that image I've noticed that parts of my menu don't show correctly (it should look like this: https://i.imgur.com/ejmlWuY.jpg ) and that can happen when you have parts of my older packs somewhere (basically GUID of from my older files turned off new one)
---
ok, did fresh install it workd. ty :)
---
It's probably one of the few games in which you are not left behind no matter how late you join.
---
What made it jarring for me was that apparently the commander and every single NPC are dumber than a bloodstone brick, because nobody ingame saw it coming. If they had played it off as "everybody knows she'll come back because she ate Joko, but will it be in time before it's too late?" that would've been awesome. But that's not what they did. They made a huge deal out of how shocking and sad her death was to everyone, made really long scenes about that, and then suddenly her resurrection got about 30 seconds and everyone was "oh, yeah, yay. Now lets go on."   
---
That sucked.
---
:-)
---
It had to be some fragment of my old packs somewhere then:-)
---
Thanks for still doing events jebro!
---
Yeah, the community is the best aside from Fractal CM's and Raids, those are toxic cespools of demon spawn.
---
Prove me wrong:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/EquPtnR](https://imgur.com/a/EquPtnR)
---
FYI, there were 11 rare unids and 39 greens before opening and salvaging. Just more evidence that the idiot above is a liar.
---
I run a Marauder/Berserker+Valkyrie mix that caps out crit chance while under the effects of Fury and I really enjoy the Power Herald playstyle too! I use him in all modes of play except high-tier Fractals. He still runs Glint/Shiro and Sw/Sw and Staff.
---
You don't need the mastery yet if you have just gotten the saddle. You just need to fly close to the Rifts' openings and stay still there as an action bar fills up hence "looking into the rifts" as the objective says iirc.
---
Hover over the rift and a bar will appear and charge. Dont need mastery for the last part of the achievement.
---
If i remember right you just have to hover close to the rift to close it then gorrik will say something else and send you on you way to do the same thing in other places. Double check your collection progress.
---
Okay, so there's expansions, and DLC. The expansions are just that, and they're a one and done payment-separate, they cost less than a Nintendo Switch first party game, about the same as one together. DLCs are the Living World episodes, which if you log in while one is active (The active one is always the most recently released one), you'll get it for free. However, Seasons 3 and 4 require specific expansions to play. Ones you haven't unlocked can be bought in the gem store, which is the microtransactions store-unlike your average Facebook game, it's all convenience items and skins, with a couple lootboxes in between, barring those Living World episodes. Plus EVERYTHING in the gem store can be essentially bought with gold since you can convert between gold and gems. Literally you don't have to spend a dime on this game outside of the expansions.
---
Heck yeah I still use it on my Norn warrior, feels satisfying as heck using Kill Shot for that true sniper feel
---
Context: RNG stuff is not available in Belgium country (mostly Mount skins, Black Lion keys and dyes), however this specific one seems to be available
---
Wanderer has niche use for front-line damage dealers in WvW that also have decent boon application. Unfortunately, due to the prevalence of boonstrip in WvW, the concentration is mostly a wasted stat, and it would typically be a little better to go with Soldier's gear for classes that need the defensive stats, but Wanderer isn't a *bad* choice.
---
In PvE, Wanderer's is just... pretty bad. Like its close relative Soldier's gear, it cripples your potential damage output while giving you a minor survivability boost. A *very* minor one, not typically enough to make you survive against the big damage of expansion enemies, and the reduced damage makes it very difficult to kill them first.
---
It's a *decent* set as a "my first armor" for a freshly leveled 80 who just needs to run around the open world while you farm up a better armor set for them, but I honestly can't think of anything I'd recommend it on as a long-term gear set.
---
Interesting
---
Inb4 it gets removed
---
&gt; And, according to this they have 500-1000 employees and is Planetside 2 is also backed by Sony. ArenaNet has around 250.
---
That is outdated. There were several mass layoffs since then. Additionally, they have a lot more games to support, whereas ANet only has Guild Wars 2.
---
Too bad Engineer uses rifle almost exactly like a shotgun.
---
Pro tip: save up *more* money and craft the whole legendary. The process of crafting the Predator unlocks the Perfected Rifle and The Hunter, and then you can sell the Predator for a decent profit.
---
The gemstore and BL chest items have seen a lot of improvement over the years but the dye kits are still so underwhelming. Spend a key, get a dye kit as a rare drop and then have a chance of maybe getting something good from it. More often than not though you'll just get a 16c common dye. If you have 100 gems for a dye kit you may as well just convert them to gold and buy what you want off the TP instead of gambling and getting something awful.
---
i think you meant confused
---
ive had a ranger that is going for poison damage and uses a longbow / axe+dagger
---
whats my best bet for equipment, stat selections, recipes, runes, sigils, pets etc. to give him a little more oomph? I often feel like im not optimized, and have really only played for fun, ignoring obsessing about stats and just playing with whats felt right, but am looking for information 
---
 to help me tweak this toon to help him hold his own even just a little better. 
---
is something like vipers gear still preferred for poison?
---
Most people don’t understand the ramifications of their trait choices in my opinion. Not that it’s an easy thing. I can see how it might be difficult for a relative beginner to the class to identify which traits would only be important in a raid setting and adapt that to open world.
---
Hey guys!   
---
I am a new Player and bough myself the latest Addons. I have 2 Level 80 Characters, but since I was long time ago, I want to start over again, I looking for a Class I can easy Level and do Endgame with (solo Stuff)   
---
I read about Necromancer and Messmer, but sadly I did not found any good Builds. So maybe you guys can help me out. Or maybe refer me a better class?
---
Has anyone had the issue of when starting the game from the launcher it looks like it's going to load and then just doesn't and gives up? I've asked support about this and they're slowly giving me things to try but it takes a while for them to reply. Has anyone had it occur to them? If so what solutions do you have?
---
yes thanks, no idea if it's possible to update a post title though
---
&gt;But that's not what they did. They made a huge deal out of how shocking and sad her death was to everyone, made really long scenes about that, and then suddenly her resurrection got about 30 seconds screen time and everyone was "oh, yeah, yay. Now lets go on."  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;That sucked.
---
i think at this point its safe to say they only did it the way they did for promotional reasons, they literally damaged the storytelling for the sake of commercial appeal, when in reality it will just dissappoint everyone who that scheme actually worked on and convinced them to play or buy PoF. they sacrificed and nearly ruined one of the most important pieces of the story for such a tiny amount of short term gain that was so quickly dispelled that they cant fool us into thinking they actually cared about her death as a plot point more than a money point
---
No
---
its not that she came back right at the start. i actually liked that. its that she came back and there was absolutely no residue of what just happened to her in any way shape or form. its like if you lived in Japan when the bombs dropped, and then the next day everything was back to normal as if the bombs had never dropped. Thats what it felt like they did, and after 7 fucking years i thought SOMEONE would have seen the backlash coming from such cheap execution.
---
I agree, that precursor and the Zarifah Rifle skin are the best designs in the game for a realistic sniper look. Both my go-to's for any rifle classes.
---
if you're looking for a leveling build, you probably won't find any because the leveling experience is part of the learning experience.
---
In general, the easiest leveling builds are power based, look for gear that gives power, precision, and ferocity
---
For necromancer: axe/focus or axe/warhorn are both valid choices, 
---
For mesmer: sword/sword and greatsword 
---
For endgame stuff, look at metabattle for general open world builds, and snowcrows and discretize for raid and fractal builds respectively
---
- Hello, my name is Mhenlo. It is your task to escort me to that place over. If I die, we all die. Undestood?
---
- Mhm.
---
- Ok. Let's get going.   ...  ...   HEALING TOUCH THE WARRIOR!!!!
---
Don’t let the creature get away. Up the tree, quickly!
---
Check some condi builds on metabattle. So far your weapon choices have a bit mixed damage focus, but viper gear is a great start.
---
Go Soulbeast with shortbow for conditions.
---
Longbow scales only with Power.
---
In PvE Ranger won't use any Bow for dps, its Greatsword and offhand Axe you deal damage with.
---
Next time pay the credit.
---
It’s never too late to join. Welcome to Tyria :-)

&gt; I used to use this with my selfless potion, but now i cant because the endless friendship "tonic" is considered a "toy".
---
But the way it is currently, you can use it together with any other potion (aside from selfless and the other one). Making it a tonic would kill way more combinations. 
---
Imo these kind of tonics should be stackable. Use friendship tonic, switch to another one (without losing the friendship one), use it and so on. Same thing for bubblehead lab and pilot box.
---
what? no

in this case it's the stupidity *of the player*
---
literally anyone buying this dye kit is burning gold
---
Ftagn !

But you are not alone!
---
I would say warrior is no longer top tier in fracs. It’s not required anymore. Lots of groups run triple dps with firebrigade, and it outdps’ warrior comps often. Of course they’re nice to have, but are not as crucial as something like quickbrand.
---
fractals for now till expansion purchases, you can gear up and climb as you go, long climb so good luck

Are you on Windows 10?

If that's the case, then I shouldn't get the chest when I kill matriarch at VB. I have been doing it for a loooong time with only 1 char daily sitting at the top of the platform.
---
Feels way too drastic for me, for every one ridiculous aura stacker there are at least a hundred normal and sometimes interesting looking people, basic avatars make things feel so boring
---
Honestly i'd rather see all aura's etc get their own system with on/off checkboxes for the ones you own and have bound to your account. Then we could use the gear without and use other gear with.
---
I've gotten a few infusions with them that i use for Fractals because of the sta bonuses which i'm not a fan of the effects of.
---
I'd also craft chuka and champawat if it meant i could use the Tigris skin but keep the effects.
---
I wouldn't mind toggling off juggernauts aura I love the hammer but the effect does not go well with alot of my armors.

---
The legendary shortbow is really cool to do. The collections trigger event, have a nice little story. And reward mini and backpack. It is really fun.
---
I've also done Astralaria, which is "okay". And Exordium where there is 0 backstory or fun, you only craft items.
---
astralaria, chuka and champawat, and H. O. P. E. all have similar collections to Nevermore, but those are the only ones to my knowledge.
---
There are one time collections you can do for the gen 1 precursors but it’s usually more cost effective to buy them.
---
Yeah, that's a good alternative :)
---
This would be fun to try! Reminds me of old Counter Strike surf maps!
---
I just bought all of them. They're all pretty okay. Buying all of the first-tier ones is super cheap anyway.
---
Then you have to get past the second collection which has no storyline.
---
But then the third ones are fun again.
---
If it is a joke I don't get it if it is not please elaborate
---
Privateer Rifle and The HMS Divinity are my favourites
---
I did, there were no Risen on the ship.

I just tried running through the mission a third time, this time with another person in my party, and that seemed to solve the bugs.

I instaled it to the instructions written there. I downloaded the zip file, extracted it into the Guild Wars 2 folder(not the bin one), double-clicked on the install application. Then, the page where you have to keep pressing Enter appeared. I kept pressing Enter, until it dissappeared and a new file appeared in the folder, named "installed". I didn't even press Enter fast. I hope that this is the correct procedure. I also downloaded the d912pxt-master file, before I realised that I needed the other one, but I deleted it before installing the right one. Maybe this is what is causing the problem? I will  rename the dll file, but I'm asking just in case it's possible.
---
My Norn happily wears the title of "Walking Flashbang."
---
I just wish you could buy the precursors of the newer legendary releases, too :-/
---
What if I don't want to change your mind?
---
So...  Mordremoth was created in a lab?! ::glares at the nearest Asura::
---
Might not be same code as one earned in pve.
---
So i've already submitted a ticket - but i was thinking about how bad this problem actually is. For the past 3 weeks i have queued a lot of games. Every day, without fail, pvp goes down for between 30 minutes to 2 hrs. Occasionally longer.
---
Normally, i would just go do some PvE but in this case i can't. The gif in the OP shows a screen that i have been stuck with for over 5 hours. I have swapped characters, zones, closed the game, deleted the cache and even reinstalled the entire game.
---
Nothing removes it. I have it if i enter WVW. I have it if i enter fractals. I have it if i try to go to dungeons, or world bosses, or do some map completion. I have been locked out of the game in its entirety (with the except of course with the gem store *wink*), for 5 hours and with no end in sight.
---
PvPers often complain about how little support is given to PvP, and the response to that is always the same - its given little support due to how little people play it and i have say, if someone said "should i pvp" - the answer is no. Don't enter PvP. If you aren't standing around waiting for the queues to start working again, you're instead locked out of the entire game, even the pve side, by bugs like these.
---
Bonus: while submitting the ticket, i decided to check the 'known issues' tracker. It was last updated 4 months ago. Not a few days. Not a week. That'd be bad. 4. months. Over 120 days. Approaching fast on half a year.
---
Checking other threads on the forums, people regularly go over a week before a response to their tickets. One of two things is happening - this is the most incompetent customer support staff i have ever seen, or it is severely understaffed, either way, the problem is ArenaNet itself. It is simply unacceptable that you cannot even get your character fixed after it being locked out of the game.
---
With no way to play the game and my day wasted waiting on it, i'm going to go play WoW instead. I severely regret spending money on this game, as these issues have been consistent for 3 weeks (and with threads dating back to 2017 that tell of the same issue), i have no doubt they will be here 2 years in the future as well.
---
Agreed. I dipped out of one but a friend kept going. He was basically being harrassed the whole time not knowing you could /gg not having legendary armor ect ect. When the boss came he got 2nd in dps shut them up afterwards but thats the kind of shit i dont have the patience to put up with. Rather get my gear through wvw instead where you rely on yourself when you roam
---
I initially unlocked it via PVE and did not get credit. I decided to try to "re-unlock it" via reward track. Still no dice.
---
Spark &gt; Incinerator.   
---
I will often use Spark's skin on a toon just because it has the same aesthetic but without being super flashy and appearance consuming.
---
They don't expect it to grow.  It's basically in maintenance mode and that's the entire point of the league system, pips and automated tournaments.  They can just toss up a season starting and season ending announcement and occasionally activate the "Call of the Mists," buff.  Honestly, though, I expect that this is [more a connectivity issue](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015788327-Configuring-your-Router-and-Firewall-Ports) between your connection and the servers than anything else.  I suspect there would be much larger outcry if this was as common as you claim it is.

The sheer size and investment of the skyscale collection is comparable to a legendary weapon or armor, so I think it's not so much "easy mode" as it is earned privilege if it were able to fly freely.  Less than 30% of the population has season 4 completed, and way less even has the skyscale itself, you could even lock the infinite flight behind a ton of mastery tiers requiring every single PoF mastery available, at that point it was be a trophy worthy of the reward of infinite flight, imo.
---
If you go to map chat in HOTM it is there - everyone sparks up at once when it happens and they all mention how often it is. Calling it the "daily pvp outage" 
---
They're so used to it now they don't even get upset. Its honestly sad.
---
Update: My ticket received a response. Anet is aware of the issue and said to keep an eye out for an update.
---
Berserker's gear is usually the best for most builds, at least those focusing on power damage (vs condition damage through bleeding/burning/poison/etc.). The cheapest way to get a full exotic set of Berserker's heavy armor is to go to the trading post and search for "Devona's" gear, or better yet (and this method will work for all armor classes, as well as weapons and accessories/rings/amulets) click the gear icon next to the search bar, put in the stats you want (power, precision, and ferocity), the rarity (exotic), and your desired level range (just set it to 80 for min and max). Then you can sort it from cheapest to most expensive to find the best deals.
---
Weapon-wise, it's up to you, but the basic rundown of warrior weapons is:
---
Axes: probably the best power weapons, they attack really fast and build up adrenaline quickly.
---
Maces: great for cc (crowd control, mainly used to disrupt enemies and damage break bars, the blue bars on champions and other enemies), deal decent damage as well.
---
Swords: one of the core warriors main condition damage weapons, swords inflict a lot of bleeding, as well as immobilize and cripple (my favorite weapon, but I play condition warrior, which is best with stats and elite spec from the HoT expansion).
---
Greatsword: Strong power damage weapon with great movement skills.
---
Hammer: Strong cc, good damage
---
Bow: Core warrior's other main condition damage weapon, inflicts burning, as well as some bleeding, immobilize, and blind, and can create a fire field with the adrenaline burst which it can then blast with the bow 3 skill to give might.
---
Rifle: ranged power damage weapon, good for single target damage, but sorta meh in general (don't let that stop you from using it in open world if you want, it just doesn't see much use in other areas right now).
---
There are only 2 generations of legendaries, Exordium was the last of the second set.
---
Seems like the damage your pet is supposed to get is instead dealt to you.
---
I don't even think that using it to collect casino coins should be considered an exploit. It's quite easy to collect every casino coin in every round without infinite flight as it is.
---
runecrafter has just a 20% chance for ectos, silver-fed has 25%
---
Hi all! I'm thinking about getting back into GW2, but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. I haven't purchased the two expansions yet. I have two level 80 characters, but haven't completed their personal stories or participated in any fractals for Ascended(?) gear.
---
I guess I'm just looking for some guidance. I made a new character and started leveling again to regain the feel of the game...should I just buy the expansions now and try to figure out all the new stuff, or catch up on the core game first? 
---
Thanks!
---
Are you going to help them solve anything for you?
---
If you do Fractals or PvP the mist-trinkets are stat-selectable non-unique ascended meaning you can equip 2 accessories or rings.  However, other than that and *maybe(?)* some of the story episode completion boxes, I don't think so.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hungry_cat_scavenger_hunt
---
Well i sent in a ticket with the details? Why would i give a random guy on twitter the details? Again - are you going to solve ArenaNet's issues for them? If no, why are you asking?
---
Not only can you feed most of them, they come home with you!
---
:(
---
I have heard that Chuka has the best collection story
---
That reminds me of the tesseract scene in Interstellar.. Now I have to go find this place in Vabbi.
---
There has been no better time than now to join
---
That's why I didn't add it to the novelties :P
---
Instantly.
---
&gt; Why would i give a random guy on twitter the details?
---
you're the one who made a thread about it.
---
You know, there's nothing wrong with trying new classes! The great thing about this game is that endgame is whatever you want it to be. I also enjoy making new characters (and dressing them up, but you don't have to do that if that's not your thing).
---
Don't feel pressured to stick to one class. If you like trying out all of them, that is also valid endgame enjoyment!
---
&gt;!Dragonflight!&lt; and &gt;!The Ascension!&lt; are obviously the showstealers, but the musical work on this episode was amazingly good.
---
And I just don't know any other major game studio that masters its soundtrack and releases it - *for free* - as promptly as Anet does.
---
I've paid money for music of lower quality.
---
Dude, this problem has been going on for days. They should be aware of it by now. He's just bringing it to reddit's attention, again, since it has been posted several times this week already.
---
Do the core game first since expansions are mostly level 80 content.
---
Cant leave, or she will ditch me
---
I made a thread asking a question. Not a thread seeking technical support that ArenaNet hasn't been able to solve for 2 years.
---
Oh well. Hope you have fun with WoW. 
---
I'd play it too but;
---
1). Not a fan of sub games, they make you feel obligated to play even if you don't feel like it (I'm aware that you can now farm ingame currency and convert it to play time but I find that  counterintuitive. 
---
2). The combat in WoW feels clunkier compared to gw2. It's one of the main reasons why I'm still sticking to it even though content releases are getting slower and slower. I don't do much anymore apart from raids and fractals but I don't see myself quitting the game entirely.
---
3). I hate gear treadmills. I like horizontal progression and improving myself rather than continuously trying to get the best gear that's released.
---
Only one? But then I couldn't live with [my Fel'sura :(](https://i.imgur.com/u3phoE0.jpg) I need two at least
---
Just saw that. I was honestly shocked and confused
---
See your first mistake was thinking pvp is something ANET cares about.
---
After a long test I think I finally knew how it happens it start every time i use entangle or ancient seed they removed vulnerability and buged the skill 😓
---
what's wrong with your faaaaaaaaaaaace
---
So you reported it and won't say how you did it.  What was the point of this thread then?  Everything would've been the same whether or not you made it.
---
I feel like most people want an option to disable other players’ auras/legendary effects/infusions/flamboyant skins, etc.
---
But I *seriously* doubt that that will ever happen. Fashion is such a huge part of this game, and if people didn’t get to show off their fashion to others, there would be probably be an enormous uproar.
---
Can’t please everybody 🤷‍♂️
---
&gt; He doesn't have to provide any "useful" information here.
---
he does if he wants us to care about it.
---
otherwise he can expects downvotes and reports for a "low value" post
---
That is very strange. I take it the internet connection to your PC is both wired and wireless?
---
Sometimes I get no internet access to my PC when the connection with my ISP is fine.  It's usually a driver issue within the network adapter. So I open up device manager, under network adapters,  I uninstall the Ethernet connection then click on action (tab at the top of the screen) &gt; scan for hardware changes &gt; the driver is automatically reinstalled. Usually solves my problem. I am not sure if this will help you at all, but nobody else replied to your message.
---
I just started Astralaria the other day.  Astralaria I is okay aside from the lame 12 day time game for getting the Mini Holographic Zinn.  Log in with an alt buy a book, log out and wait for the next day.  Sigh..
---
The rest of the collection looks like it is going to be fun though. Although I'll probably have to find a kind Mesmer for Not So Secret.  :)
---
So OP if you decide to work toward Astralaria start on that mini collection as soon as possible unless you already have it.
---
It looks so fun!! I wish there were certain places where infinite flight was allowed, like guild hall for example, or a special instance. I'd love to get a taste of infinite free flight but if it was allowed everywhere then it would get unfun fast and make other mounts useless.
---
what do you thinkn about the awakened mounts skin pack? they all look pretty cool and not too much expensive
---
"Lamp"
---
[oK]
---
NA getting the records that matter Pog
---
I personally doesn't enjoy soloing with Mesmer (as my second character). The leveling experience is pretty subpar as compared to my guardian character.
---
To me, I feel that Mesmer itself is pretty weak unless you finish up to lv80 and the full elite spec on either Chrono/Mirage (with at least 15 mastery point). This whole journey can be a pretty discouraging experience itself, due to the nature of Mesmer himself.
---
I have friends who done that, though, so it's up to you to decide.
---
Maybe Anet doesn't expect the PvP to grow. No need to care if you have little or zero expectations in the first place.
---
Once again you're missing the point - either because you refuse to engage with the actual posts or because it simply cannot enter your mind that it could be ArenaNets fault. 
---
Lets run through exactly what you suggest:
---
&gt;Is this happening in a specific region?
---
If it is, why does this matter to me - the player? Do i move to the US? Even if it is happening to a specific region, the massive amounts of complaints they've had over the past **3 years** will show which region it is on.
---
&gt;Is this happening at a specific time?
---
Again, why does this matter **to me** the player? Again - even if it is, the massive amount of bug reports, corresponding to the massive drop in PvP participation, will show the devs exactly when it occurs.
---
&gt;Is this happening with a certain ISP?
---
.
---
&gt;What does your ping-plotter or Tracert look like?
---
I'll just skip to the point - you're wrong. You're wrong in the same way using a fork to unscrew a screw is wrong. You're just not thinking about the actual problem, you're repeating lines of dialog that exist to place blame on the player, when in this case, it quite clearly cannot be the player.
---
&gt;You want to cut out support having to ask these questions by providing details that aren't just "Hurrdurr, PvP broken pls fix." 
---
Details that they already know, or are aware are on their side, evidenced by the fact that over the past 3 years, they've had to manually free players from this bugged state that their game places them in, resulting in them making automated scrips to fix players in this state - a band aid fix i might add.
---
Recently, those automated scripts broke and by recently i mean [April](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/9645/report-stuck-in-queue/p10) which i know i know - its really really hard for you to understand, but i promise - their scripts breaking is not something i can fix by sending you a tracert, phoning my ISP, portforwarding, reinstalling the game or clearing the cache.
---
&gt;Asking for relevant data isn't white knighting -- it's being pragmatic
---
No, it isn't. Asking for data that you erroneously call relevant is in itself white knighting. Its running goalie and by definition, trolling the thread. Asking for this information when it is not needed is worthless and only serves to waste everyone time. It is not worth the internet bandwidth it is written on. You may as well be asking me what my diet is.
---
&gt; Anecdotes aren't particularly helpful, my dude, numbers are.
---
Let me just pull the server numbers for dips in participation and how many players their automated script was engaging with prior to it breaking. I'll update my post when ArenaNet server engineers give me that data.
---
&gt; Calling me a troll or a white knight because I'm curious about these things detracts from the seriousness of the issue.
---
curious? you can be curious about my diet too, but keep in mind that your curiosity is not always relevant and often wastes time. You find this out as a child when your parent asks you to stop asking dumb questions.
---
&gt;Server issues like packet loss and hangs are stupidly frustrating, been there, done that.
---
Packet loss?!
---
You're making my head spin. Do you even know what you're talking about? I feel like im talking to someone who lurked on a tech support forum for 2 days and now feels like they're an expert. Take it from someone who actually works in IT - this has precisely nothing to do with packet loss.
---
&gt;Generic troubleshooting issues copy pasta
---
Nice! Oh - before you ask, yes, my PC is switched on at the wall and yes my keyboard is plugged in at the back. Neither of those enabled the GW2 PVP servers to be stable and stop bugging the server side roster caches.
---
I just started Astralaria the other day. Astralaria I is okay aside from the lame 12 day time game for getting the Mini Holographic Zinn. Log in with an alt buy a book, log out and wait for the next day. Sigh..
---
The rest of the collection looks like it is going to be fun though. Although I'll probably have to find a kind Mesmer for Not So Secret. :)
---
OkayChamp
---
Agreed! I love Tigris' design, and Save The Queen doesn't look bad either with that little purple gem on the hilt. It amazes me sometimes how detailed some precursors are.
---
Thanks! I'll try that.
---
That would be awesome for some of the flying challenges, too. Or even collecting magic in mid-air; i hate when i can't see the thing i'm picking up because my mount's in the way.
---
I'll try it.
---
Ppl downvoting a crucial bug, interesting...
---
Reddit at it's finest 😂
---
I have just got a drop on ascended mace, however, kinda realised that no class uses this weapon. Any suggestions on what to do with it to at least gain some value from it?
---
Are you sure you have dx12 installed? the proxy is just a wrapper around d3d9 that uses dx12, so make sure that it's installed first and that your GPU is dx12 capable.
---
Wow, Timberline is my favorite map in-game still.  Would love to visit the real life version!
---
People will downvote anything presented as a rant unless it is a sentiment shared by the current browsing majority.  So class specific bugs presented as a title gore rant will get downvoted.
---
The issue of damage to entangle roots being applied to the ranger is worthy of a post though.
---
Doesn't matter anymore. I've unistalled the game and reinstalled it. Thank you for the help, though!
---
Binding of Ipos? Nah, i’d rather run around with a torn piece of paper in my Tyria’s #1 Paperboy cosplay.
---
But is smells like almonds.
---
Exactly this. If I can't show off my fashion and make your eyes cry why play a fashion game?
---
Yes indeed it's really very expensive and complicated and it takes a lot of time but I've already created maze races of jumping puzzles really big it's my hobby on gw2
---
What would you suggest? We already have:
---
- stat infusion
---
- stat-selectable armour, weapons and trinkets
---
- weapon skins (fractal, golden fractal, nightmare)
---
- 2 tonics
---
- 2 cosmetic infusions
---
- 4 prestige titles
---
- permanent account FotM boosts
---
- endless potion boosts
---
- a mini set
---
There are a lot of things to grind for in fractals
---
Thank you for the explanation I'm new to reddit and not familiar with how or what should i do when bosting but it is not rant I'm not complaining of the hidden nerf like sharpening stone I'm complaining because of a bug 😭
---
GW2 NPCs are mostly useless because they can be ignored.
---
GW1 NPCs failed the mission if they died. Which they did, often.
---
Hey man, really sorry to hear that it sounds like it sucks a lot. When does it happen do you remember? I play pvp everyday as well and haven’t encountered this issue at all so I’m lucky I guess. 
---
Concerning your issue of friends and yourself leaving the game becasue pvp is all you care about. That is also sad to hear because gw2 is a pve game I think they make it pretty clear so I think unfortunately you invested in the wrong basket. I do agree that the pvp modes are really fun for me in this mode and the nice combat system feels a bit like a wasted opportunity for pvp enthusiasts. I hope you the best and maybe check back if pvp ever becomes their side project again.
---
i gotta spend as much time with her as i can you know
---
Who is talking about Raids and fractals though? We're talking about open world silly event for a mount that is supposed to be accessible to everyone....
---
Revenant makes the best use of it currently in PvE, it's a staple for condi damage builds.  Beyond that, new elite specs should be added to the game eventually, and since Mace is a weapon only three classes currently use, it makes sense that it'd be a weapon someone else will get access to.  It might be worth holding it until then as a result, even if it is a while.
---
The fun thing about this guy is that "change my mind" is impossible.
---
In his mind, there is a global communist conspiracy that pushes a gay climate change agenda.
---
Okay, it's not fun, it's sad. I know that this is a bit off-topic but I feel compelled to write it whenever someone links to this fucking guy.
---
To get back to guild wars: Please give us the option to block visuals by right clicking... My poor pc is suffering.
---
Anyone wanna explain to me how you're sliding? Judging by your feet, there's an intractable I missed?
---
Well, considering that fractals are the only 5-man instanced content that anet supports, I would imagine that they would keep it updated with new rewards every time a new one comes out. They were doing so for 99 and 100 and then stopped.
---
Don't delete the large .dat file though, that's just assets and a PITA to re-download.
---
Deleting everything but .dat and exe should be enough. When you run the .exe, everything else should get regenerated.
---
It's with the fractal console in the guild hall there's an option on it that allows you to slide
---
So I just came back after a 3 year break and boosted a warrior for wvw. Spell breaker is definitely the roaming and organized build of choice but I personally couldn't get into it. I went zerker with full Marauder (easier to get now with bladed armor boxes, can also do the armor reward track in wvw). Arc divider apparently got nerfed right before I came back but I love it. Just have to time your bursts right and use defensives/healing inbetween. Can really turn the tide of a battle with your burst and get some "wtf did you do to them" reactions, which is fun.
---
My friend, have you heard of the Church of Sic'Em?
---
I dont mind stacking but just give us options to turn them on and off instead of taking an infusion slot
---
"He got his wife"
---
Uhhhh, nnoo..? I'm the one who found the thing, why would I not, myself, come back to check the thread for it.
---
And I mean, yeah, you sound pretty angry.
---
I see you comment to help new players out a lot, and I just have to say its really wonderful to see. I know so many people who have needed or wanted help as a low level and seeing you so active and ready to help on reddit is a breath of fresh air 🙂
---
You sent your GF this...? Even though it was a joke, I would apologize
---
There's some guild hall unlock that lets you have infinite flight as an orb I know that.
---
Only a small percentage of people I offer help to ever contact me, but I try.  I really enjoy playing with new players. The game is such a breath of fresh air in the genre, that it's fun to watch people see how it's laid out first hand.
---
The other side of the coin is that the game doesn't always explain itself well. Plenty of people expect a bog standard MMO and are confused when they get in, so it helps build the community as well.
---
See i agree with all of this, but i've had this same issue since 4.30pm. I wasted hours trying to fix this manually. I then stopped and went to play WoW. 
---
WoW is pretty shit right now, but it is still at bare minimum a 5/10 and with the ability to buy game time with gold, its no skin off my back. One game is working, one isn't.
---
Oh, its 1 AM btw and i just logged in to check - still broken.
---
And yeah, after manually trying to fix it for hours i stumbled upon posts from over 2 years ago, as well as ones from april and today, confirming that this is ArenaNets problem and only ArenaNet can fix it.
---
I basically have to wait for a developer to manually take the time out of his day to fix my account, again, manually.
---
Considering there are support threads open where people with stolen accounts wait *weeks* to get a response, i very much doubt im going to get the time of a programmer any time soon.
---
So maybe i'll check in tomorrow, or maybe i won't.
---
As i said in my ticket - the only thing i can do is play menu wars 2. So i spent the past 30 minutes selling an item to a guy. Fun.
---
