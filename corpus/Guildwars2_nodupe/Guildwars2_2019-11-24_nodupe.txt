Well cc is part of the record just like dps is. Perfectioning which class has to use which cc skill so that the bar breaks asap while still maximizing damage output is an “art” on its own in a way. I mean honestly, if you would just use cons to break all ensolyss bars for example then that would take away 90% of the Record in regards to theorycraft and challenge
---
---
---
There’s about this and amazons servers
---
Well they pretty much failed on release with that.  You know, no infrastructure to actually support turnaments and such.
---
you understand that your whole *lore* and *story* is on level of kids fantasy book... right weeboo? maybe go out sometimes and stop calling ppl idiots over fictional stories and fantasy characters? =))
---
We have been trying for years, years and nothing ever changes, only thing that is left is just being negative.
---
Omg it’s a Trojan
---
This is supposed to replace expansions. This is the games future and we are at a point where anet has to prove that they are able to deliver and releasing just an insight is just not good enough anymore.
---
Yeah like the egg sac, so worthless.
---
Dwayna the Rock Ice Jormagson.
---
I would take your own advice and step out of that not-so-cozy basement every once in a while.
---
Always at dusk
---
Do heart quests. Once they are complete they should trigger a dynamic event nearby. Do the event and when it ends don't run away. Pay attention took to that the npc says and if they run away follow them. The events link together to trigger a chain of events and play out little storylines within the map. You'll naturally fill hearts and complete a few map points as you do this too.
---

---
Kill ambient creatures. The non-aggressive ones. Creatures start to charge up bonus exp the lo get they have been alive. The ambient ones usually give the most because players ignore them. 
---
Do jumping puzzles, mini dungeons and achievements. When you're on a particular map look up what jumping puzzles and achievements are available. You'll get bonus exp and rewards for doing them as well as build your achievement rank toward other long term rewards. Lots of the puzzles and mini dungeons are really fun as well.
---
Do crafting. You get exp for this. Craft something that makes sense to your main character too because you'll likely want to make ascended gear eventually.
---
Do PvP. You'll get lots of character level up tomes. Once you wualify for ranked arena youll get double rewards because youll gain from 2 reward tracks instead of just 1.
---
Do WvW. You can hop in and join a zerg. You'll get lots of exp for the events and for defeating other players. It's also am interesting way to change up what you're used to In open world.
---
The point is to just play the game. It's not like other mmos which block content until end game. It does a good job if making content available to you sooner and is designed to be played, rather than grinded to access something which is just a further grind.
---
Yes, thats why I pointed out CMs. You would have public mode, normal squad mode, and CM squad mode.
---
I mean, the prologue was actually pretty great as far as open world goes. It's almost like they just shot themselves in the foot by calling it a prologue because now people can act like this episode is the start of season 5 and therefore the future of it will be bad.
---
I love how many details has this map &lt;3
---
Longbow is actually good on bosses where you have chance to percast skill 5 before phases, like Siax or Arkk
---
They said they want a big or update patch around every month. Including the festivals in between and other major updates. so basically if a month does not have a festival or a big feature coming in it will have an episode.  Lets hope they make it true.
---
Yea I've heard this feedback a lot recently. It honestly could be a huge enough impact to change the code to make a specific option the default as opposed to an option that starts with the volume high and is often and easily over looked.
---
Other stuff would need to be converted. Friday I took a look at those Mist Warriors in Black Citadel. They are using some of that old tech. It was late enough in the day where I was like "OK. I will tackle this spider-web next week" haha :)
---
I appreciate the feedback. Noted!
---
I understand where you're coming from, but our data would disagree. I'm really sorry you're not enjoying it. I understand that not everyone is going to love the same things but I still take your feedback seriously and I shall pass it along :)
---
Thank you so much for the kind words! You made really great points and I'm excited for you to play!
---
Have fun!
---
Jormag is manipulating everyone, not just Norn. 
---
For HoT the Sylvari were dragon minions, the Norn are not dragon minions.
---
Oh me too! The one with mittens? It's my fav!
---
Oh no...you've put this idea in my head now...now it has to become reality! ;)
---
you could have just use dh instead of a condi fb in that scenario but ok
---
One thing I will admit is that we should be wary of saying the strike missions need CMs. While I would actually love to see them, to Anet this comes with a connotation of extra mechanics on the boss. We don't need this. 
---
Instead, we should ask for a hard mode, because that really is all we want. I want the boss to deal more damage, and have more health, that's it. While I'd love for the chain mechanics to have a greater effect, and be punished harder for focusing one boss, this becomes work for the devs that they're unwilling to do.
---
All the community is asking for is a button to increase the damage and increase the health of the bosses. That is all.
---
Don't ignore the rest of his post.
---
Yea I've personally been around the map seeing all the various colored beams going off, haha.
---
Yes, sorry
---
Did you read the first paragraph of the post?
---
[Bad Dragon, you say?](https://bad-dragon.com/shop)
---
At the beginning of the quest, he says there were others. One is still around, haunting the forest.
---
&gt;**Bright Shore**: There were three of us. Envoys from Still Waters Speaking. Sent to ask the Vigil for aid.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;\[...\]  
---
&gt;**Bright Shore**: My other companion... He fled into the forest...said he felt the call. He's different now. 
---
When we kill the Boneskinner as part of the quest, it drops a book, written by a kodan who was turning after consuming norn and kodan flesh.
---
I fully explored zone by zone , tagging events, doing daily world bosses and anomaly that i could find, while following my story line. 
---
I went from queensdale-kessex hills-gandaran fields-lornars pass-dredgehaunt cliffs- timberline falls- mt maelstrom- straits of devastation- malchors leap- cursed shore.
---
I didn't had any problems with leveling, some zones had more frequent events like south of dredgehaunt cliffs so picking up a level or two before the next story step wasn't an issue.
---
I haven't done any dungeons at all, tho i was told they grant a massive amount of exp, and for boosters i used some food sometimes and sometimes i also would teleport back to queensdale to pick up some banner buffs which would almost always be there.
---
I played on a human necromancer, mostly with axe/warhorn + staff, 4 minions and spectral walk for perma swiftness
---
The entire quest implies he was becoming a Boneskinner. Apparently, the only way to prevent someone becoming a boneskinner, is to feed them boneskinner flesh, since at the end:
---
&gt;**Bright Shore**: Yes... Yes... It's so sweet... Makes me whole... The ache is gone... It's finally gone.  
---
&gt;**Bright Shore**: You've saved me. It's really gone... I can't hear it... Just need to rest for a little while... Thank you. Thank you.
---
I'd be a little worried about how u/atomicxblue would be *feeding* this... pet boneskinner.
---
Of course i did... did you read what i just wrote? I am talking about Dragonhunter not Power QFB... you can easily prestack with 100% bd to 50 secs of quickness then swap to Dragonhunter and use that...
---
Here’s a better quality clip.

Nope, he was becoming a Boneskinner. He was hearing whispers telling him to eat, and whenever he ate that hunger grew and grew. This mirrors the wendigo myth, where wendigos hunger and whenever they eat something, their hunger grows rather than becoming sated.
---
The Fallen, on the other hand, are ghosts. You can tell because they're transparent.

8 hours is only a third of a day by the way.

I made a [post about this on the GW2 Forums](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/92721/hallucinations-whispers-in-the-dark-spoilers) the other day and I collected quite a bit of the hallucinations aspect of Bjora's Marches.
---
- A ghostly norn woman (possibly vigil) crying near Claw's Perch 
---
- A dark giant marching through the Aberrant Forest
---
- A norn that appears in fighting stance at the south of Svanir's Plateau
---
- A dead norn that appears along the path of the Investigating Massacre event
---
- A norn spirit that sits at on a hill north of Bjora's Keep
---
- A norn tied to a tree south of Bjora's Keep
---
Some of these are not found by me, but allegedly found by other people in the GW2 Forum. I've only personally seen the Dark Giant, Crying Norn Woman, and Almorra's Tree Ghost. I only have screenshots of the Dark Giant and Almorra's Tree Ghost.
---
I'm thinking what other people have already mentioned here, that we're stuck in some groundhog's day timeloop and we're seeing past iterations of what has already happened *or* Jormag created these hallucinations to mess with us, especially Almorra's ghost that's suppose to trick your vision and think that you've just mistaken a tree for Almorra.
---
well,if you playing  15 years MMO for story....rip son. its like dating a girl for playing cards with her,but hey i bet you have no idea what girl even looks like.
---
&gt; It's as if over the last year or so, gamers in general have lost all sense of perspective. Everything is blown out of proportion.
---
It has always been so. So shall it always be.
---
No gold yet? I can help you getting it if you like.
---
&gt; The episode was alright but a far cry from the advertised expansion worthy content
---
Anet calls cooking 500 and messy tem... loadouts expansion content. They can just tell you that is all expansion content you are getting.
---
Why don't you just come out and say you don't like the story and you want us to defend it so you can have an argument over it?
---
Replacing Kralk took some pretty unlikely events. A dragon champion, capable of seeing the future, forcefully reprogrammed by an extinct species of mages, had a child, who consumed the power of an immortal lich, and an elder dragon so consumed by pain that He told this grandchild specifically how to end and replace him. 
---
It would probably be rather time consuming to start work on another one of those.
---
His mother, who he replaced.
---
Given that Jormag's domain is persuasion, it's likely that it prefers having lesser beings alive to speak to. When all the magic and civilizations are gone, Jormag goes back to sleep. It just doesn't want to sleep yet, especially while there's a new peer with uncertain intentions and capabilities.
---
5 ppl with brain is best comp you can ever have.
---
Well id rather craft 32 slot bags over a collection of weapons ill never use.
---
I actually want to upgrade to 32 slots but i still need ton craft astralaria, meteorlogicus and the underwater leggies
---
Whoa, that art style works amazing with GW2! Now I wish I had art like that of my main :o
---
I envy you artist people!
---
Rota say that rumpo wins
---
Thank you came to reddit just for this :).
---
Except to see if something like the "Saga" will work means giving it time to run its course. 1 Prologue and 1 Episode, released only 2 months apart (faster than S3 or S4) is hardly enough time to find out if it will work. Hell, they even said some "Episodes" may include no new map content.
---
&gt; I'm sure it won't last.  
---
I'v been a part of it for the last 5ish years, and it's lasted quite alright. Even when there is controversy, the devs themselves (including the lead project developer) are quick to post on the Subreddit themselves to clear up their thoughts, and spend several days replying to as many reddit comments as they can.
---
Furthermore, they don't just respond to comments as a marketing ploy, but actually **ask questions** on what people want to see, and go on to make those changes in the next patch. I'v seen it happen myself several times.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It also helps that PoE has been consistently releasing actual expansion level content twice a year, with smaller balance patches which add new skills/quests/gear every couple months. The main focus on their patches being: Replayability. Something quite lacking in current Gw2 patches.
---
Anet could learn a lot from them tbh
---
My first awareness that gaming had a fan culture around it it was because people were losing their shit over something in the very early days of the interwebs. Probably about *Final Fantasy 8* or something. Can't remember. It was 20 years ago. 
---
Honestly it wasn't too much of a surprise to me to see it since I had come from *Star Trek*, *Doctor Who*, and Anime fandom in the 80s and 90s, where fans losing their shit was part of each club meeting. Did you know that everyone hated Commander Riker back then? Now we love his bearded magnificence. Even I can't figure out why and I was there for it. (Love you Will)
---
But basically: Geeks're gonna geek. MMOs always going to have  group of players acting like their dog was run over. If Anet handed out cookies they would be put on blast for providing chocolate chip instead of Oreos. And so it goes.
---
i got key 3/3 in my 1st completions, i thought its 100% drop lol. Then i did completion on the rest characters \^\^ no keys later
---
wtf that looks almost exactly like my thief.
---
Yeah, I saw that mining ghost too. It was mining one of the map currency nodes and I did after and I was wondering "You know, what if gathering these things increases Jormag's influence over us and that's how she died?"
---
I didn't even say the Norn are dragon minions, learn to read for fuck's sake.
---
Well done not reading the journal as well.
---
&gt;You have the best PvP on the market and you let it rot to hell.
---
...This is incredibly arguable tho. Even with patches, there are other MMOs with better PvP modes and mechanics, and that are also pleasant to watch.
---
Then you haven't been following the community of PoE closely...
---
&gt; "Keep your starting equipment in case hidden endgame quest requires is".
---
Wait, what? Is that a thing in GW2?
---
What I imagine is that we're in the shiverpeaks and Primordus wakes up and, angry at Jormag (cause ice blast machine balthy used) launches an attack while we're in Jormag's territory.  
---
ofc what I imagine is pure unsupported speculation, to make of it what you will
---
I saw this also when my friend and I were playing! They interacted with the dirt pile and the boneskinner popped out lol I was actually a bit nervous
---
I swear it says "I want... Power" instead of "I want her"
---
Yeeeeeeeea.  I'm with you man.
---
&gt;My first awareness that gaming had a fan culture around it it was because people were losing their shit over something in the very early days of the interwebs. Probably about Final Fantasy 8 or something.
---
Oh if there was large-scale faecal loss it was probably FF7. I love that game but it really brings out the crazies.
---
&gt;Did you know that everyone hated Commander Riker back then? Now we love his bearded magnificence. Even I can't figure out why and I was there for it. (Love you Will)
---
That's actually a new one on me honestly. I would've expected Pulaski or Troi. Wasn't really old enough for the whole fandom thing, being 5 when it finished it's run.
---
&gt;But basically: Geeks're gonna geek. MMOs always going to have group of players acting like their dog was run over. If Anet handed out cookies they would be put on blast for providing chocolate chip instead of Oreos. And so it goes.
---
I definitely agree, but can't help but feel like the *escalation of expectation* has become a particular issue as of late. As I sort of touched on with the TF2 reference.
---
Your chest piece and shoulders look nice. Your bottom piece looks funny.
---
I'm surprised it released before January. And if we get the other half in January then I won't be particularly disappointed.
---
My main source of disappointment is with the lack of challenging endgame content and how much equipment loadouts break the utility of legendary equipment.
---
Boots are whispers, legs are koda, chest looks like ascalonian, houndskin mantle on the shoulders.
---
i dont recognize the helm or gloves, so probably pvp/wvw gear, triumphant maybe?
---
council guard helm or heavy plate helm might be good subsitutions
---
there is a very high chance that all other accounts will also be banned as well.
---
its not worth the risk in the long run
---
I struggle to even call Raven's masteries "masteries". Because they aren't, they're essentially just story steps. You can't even enter the new map without obtaining "Raven Bond" in the course of the story (let's assume teleport to friend isn't a thing, because it breaks everything), heck, they even automatically fill your experience bar just so you could obtain it right then and there. So what's the point of even calling it a mastery, if every account WILL have it by the time they finish the intro instance and enter the map? Every player will be able to open these arbitrary raven walls scattered around the map, so what's the point of them even being there? Raven Bond could've been a just an obligatory objective in the first instance and it wouldn't have changed a thing. And Raven's Light could've been a story progress bar filled by completing events and whatnot, just like in many episodes before. Because you have to get it to finish the story, therefore most players will have it anyway. But at least with this there's a CHANCE of a player not having it, unlike the first one.
---
Well, yeah. The original idea was abandoned before launch. At that point, its not even a retcon, people just have an opinion on something they never played
---
One of the coolest of these type of portraits I've seen on this subreddit!
---
Lol glad I’m not the only one!  
---
Biggest for me was trying to intuit what training the mastery even does. Keep getting pop ups saying “you need [noun] to open that”, “you need [noun] to pick that up”
---
It depends on what they were trying to create. For a true RPS mechanic, it makes sense. For the type of stuff they actually did, it doesn't.
---
I'm not 100% positive, but I believe the way it works is that when the ability begins, it creates warning circles on the ground in the location of each player. After a short delay, anyone still inside of any one of those circles gets immobilized, even if you've moved out of "your" circle but are now inside "someone else's" circle when it triggers.
---
For this reason, you should pay attention to dodge not only out of your circle but out of every circle. It makes it a lot easier if everyone is stacked very tightly, because that creates a very compact area of circles; if everyone is spread out, there is a very large area full of circles, and it may be difficult to dodge out of this area.
---
Well this is 7 years late
---
I feel like the Boneskinner is bugged because your special action/essence manipulation never procs on him. He also spawns no essence, unlike the abberants. It would certainly be helpful when you have many players with no cc abilities.
---
It doesn't matter because the essences do not matter. The only thing you need to care about is just getting them to t2 so you can open all the chest and even that doesn't matter unless you want to craft the new weapons(can also be bought on TP) or bags.
---
He should take the CPU to the golem and make it practice rotation until fps increases. 😉
---
You are not alone. Reading the new masteries made no sense to me at all, I just had to unlock them and fuck around to realize what they were supposed to do. Tier 1 gives u access to small chests of the same type, and tier 2 gives you access to medium chests of the same type. 
---
Also, I finally looked at the build templates today. Holy shit it took me a solid hour to realize what the fuck was happening. It is so unnecessarily complicated.
---
TBH, Piniata is slide show for almost anyone.
---
I just hope they do something similar when GW3 is coming out. I loved doing this in GW1, even if some of the rewards ended up being meh.
---
as an aussie, most of the time i was immobilised because of 300 ping, but i brought ranged weapons (axe/focus) as well as greatsword on my reaper.
---
its been good for a while

---
I'm a zoomer and I think it's just really weird and unnecessary for the game in general
---
Koda the judge and kodan the jury.
---
I've heard that if you roam around transformed as Koda (I guess with that combat tonic from BSF), some uniques dialogues/things can happen, can anyone confirm?
---
&gt;Best MMO is very subjective. I find FFXIV to be the best.
---
Ok, but this is the GW2 sub. 
---
&gt;Since it seems you took my post as saying that they haven't delivered on enough things, then maybe we should hear about what they had planned when saying we could look forward to expansion level content in the Saga?
---
Which feature did they promise would be in the Icebrood Saga, and that was definitely *not* delivered by the last episode of it?
---
&gt; Saying what they're giving to us, especially now that the saga has officially started, shouldn't be much of an issue if they're able to live up to what they say and deliver on it.
---
It would be nice if we lived in a world in which ANet openly discussed content that was more than one patch out, but unfortunately we've never lived in such a world. They announce incoming features when you'll be able to play them in a month or less. 
---
Personally, the only thing *I* think they over-hyped was the theater announcement thing.
---
[removed]
---
For me its just the lack of content added given the time since the last addition/change. You can think whatever you want, you can even say more to come, but at the end of the day, they took like 3 months and they produced essentially 30-45 minutes of one play through content, with achievements and (not going to go into criticism of them now) masteries to encourage about 4-6 hours of content. I dont know what its like programming or trying to make something new in a game, though I do imagine there should be more to show for 2-3 months. More than that, you dont even need to add anything, players might still complain (people will complain about anything), but if they at least dropped a nice balance update it would go a long way since you could re-do older content with the new class balance changes.
---
Even sons of svanir is extremly disorganized. If Jormag ever managed to fully organize them, it would be a serious trouble. Meanwhile, Jormag seems like not imbuing too much power to its minions at all. Jormag favors exploiting its minion's own power instead of "bestowing" extra dragon power.
---
i always thought those rules were bullshit. everyone can buy feathers from the merchant, so why not use them? the game offers this tool for you. yes it would make thief useless, but why is thief being useless not okay and necro being useless okay? it's just how it is.
---
Considering how clean the orb looked like in Gw1, the Gw2 version is a little underwhelming with the wispy blue flame. The concept art has so much character in both the shaft leading to the claw and the actual claw. I think the fellblade, fds,  centurion claw, and icebreaker translated very well into gw2.
---
And that from a necro main :D 
---
Thought you would convince me that necro is broken op
---
Season 3 was every 2 months, almost, and if felt meatier than this episode. I would be ok with this every 2 months tho, IF IF IF, they gave us something new for the core game, aka change to the things long time players do everyday, aka raids/fractals/dungeons/pvp/wvw but the update was only ep1, and it was way too short, so it fells really lackluster
---
Oh wow this is way more clear. Thanks!
---
Except there were some cliffs that were just out of reach of a springer and the wild skyscale covered some portions but there are still times you need to do stuff like kill things.
---
It's not about a class being useless being okay or not okay, it is about finding solutions to  problems by actually using a class comp that helps solving those problems. Necro would have always been useless nontheless back in the day, however if harpy fethers would have been allowed then the team comps would have been incredibely stale for most dungeons, especially during old fgs 4 times. You can't tell me that would have been any more fun  than the whole team having to work together by blasting stealth fields?
---
Do you guys stack 30 essence near to the wp area or did you manage to get enough essence by kill monsters?
---
They announced this new content delivery system, upgrading the "living story" to a saga.  The prologue was generally well-received.
---
Out comes the first "full" chapter and it's _really_ short.  Good story and mood, but mostly just walking and talking.  My second run through took less than 90 minutes.  After the first day there are a lot more people running around the prologue than the new content.
---
Their first swing at the new content delivery should have been their best shot, to demonstrate to the community that this was the quality they should expect going forward.
---
Instead we got short and unimpressive, leaving us with the impression that _this_ is the quality we should expect going forward.
---
After all the upheaval Anet has seen over the last year, we wanted this to make us feel better about the state of the game, not worse.
---
I play firebrand in the strike mission and pump out a lot of reflects and Resistance to avoid the immobilizes, has been pretty effective so far..
---
These masteries are even worse than the one from Siren's Landing, so i proceeded to pretend they do not exist.
---
Fight enemies. I'm not sure if this training area give persisting bonuses. Just check your boons over utility skill bar
---
It's because "Oh shit, we gotta add new masteries to the next season- I mean saga! Quick, think of something, we've maybe 24h before we get pulled back to designing mount skins!".
---
i found a personal dc just by clicking on as many shrines as possible, it kicks you back to selection screen, reported it.
---
I have a lot to say about Bjora Marches but I'll sum it up really quickly
---
The map didn't impress me. The strike mission is uninteresting. Raven mastery doesn't do anything and Essence mastery is somehow both pointless and too strong. The meta is so boring and mobs don't even drop loot (essences give you magic find but the meta doesn't even give you loot, what?!). Reward phase is par for the course but not competitive.
---
The story didn't impress me. Nothing happened! None of the plot goals have progressed, Almorra just got the redshirt treatment for redshirt reasons. This is the first time that we're speaking to Jormag but he's a character with really weak establishment that we don't care about. Raven I like, including the contrast between Raven and Jormag, but Raven gets so little screentime it's a footnote. Nevermind that Jormag whispering to us makes zero sense; Aurene has the same power and could just run interference for the entire Vigil deployment and everyone would be fine.
---
The most interesting feature of the patch is that it consolidates and improves Living World dailies so that those maps are populated. It's a bummer when the most interesting feature of a patch is the reason to revisit prior patches.
---
It's also a real shame when Bound by Blood was absolutely amazing. The map was great. The events were great. The story very clearly set up each of the characters, including the antagonist.
---
Despite how it may seem, the majority of my hours are on dragonhunter and i am most accustomed to it. @fines/sans Although theorycraft might enable a different group composition so you may inevitably remove cfb, condi firebrand is completely integral to this record. No other class in the game can solo 4th (while it evades TWICE) to then return back to the platform in time. Re-watch the video and see exactly how tight that gap is.... I take my portal to platform 4 (it evades) i put all condis on, then take the portal back while the condis tick... We did try with dh to begin with initially, and imagine this: "dh bursts from 100-66%, its now has 12s cd's and NEEDS to take the portal and burst the add imidiatly...... It does, and the add dies (somehow after it evades) and you take the portal back to middle. You now need to burst from 66%-33% what skills do you have??? aight, its now time to take the portal out to the same 4th add at 33% split phase only this time you havent precasted traps on it, so u need to commit at least a gs 4 2 procession of blades and SOJ (for valn) resting in another set of cooldowns and somehow your successful soloing this final add.... You now need ALL your cds to burst from 33-0...." its not do-able, not on dh, feel free to bang your head against the wall trying. Frenzy sigil also doesnt proc on these adds and using sword is next to useless.
---
&gt; Why are the designations for each mastery type three completely interchangeable nouns
---
Well, I would assume it sounds better than having them called "Red", "Blue" and "Green". I think it is just something you will have to get used to.
---
&gt; every mastery tree and icon colored blue?
---
this is something I question too. The colour coding is already in the game (not just for the masteries) through the essence drops and the colours of enemies and then those masteries have no mention of this. 
---
&gt; What are the triggered abilities associated with the masteries?
---
When you gathered 30 orbs of one of those Essences you will be able to use the Skill for that Essence which is Spirit Nova, Night terror and Shattered Psyche which do different things and get more powerful depending on the Tier your mastery is.
---
* Spirit Nova: Damage and Launch (and might on T2)
---
* Night Terror: Damage and Pull (and quickness on T2)
---
* Shattered Psyche: Damage and float (and Fury on T2)
---
Though, those skills seem to be only available on special enemies like champs.
---
&gt; Can I attune to multiple [nouns] at once?
---
&gt; If I can attune to multiple masteries at once, does that make me weak to certain masteries?
---
You can pick up more than one essence at a time but so far I haven't noticed actually picking up essences 30 times of more than one colour. 
---
It doesn't seem that way that you get weaker but it does have a positive effect in which you gain damage reduction. so 30%-40 from green when you have red.
---
There also seems to be a way to get an additional effect that adds 2% per stack (25 stacks so 50%) magic find when you kill enemies that are weak against the essence you carry.
---
&gt; Why do I need 30 orbs?
---
Well, it is explained when you do the training that you need to pick up 30 essences so that you get access to the Special Action skill. I would imagine that anything lower would mean you could run around with any of those fully charged effects on you and never really get them down.
---
&gt; why is there an Asura attempting to science my magic instead of a Norn teaching me?
---
That is a good question, I would imagine that Norn are more reluctant to share their interaction with the spirits?! And Asuras just know everything better than other bookah races. ;)
---
&gt; Please let me know if I'm going senile
---
For me personally, I do like the Rock-Paper-Scissors mechanic but IMO it doesn't really fit into the PvE map. Most champ encounters melt without those skills anyway and even when you would need it the only real advantage of this is another CC you get through the special action skill. Most professions have Fury, Might and Quickness already available to them and can stack them high enough that the additional boon from those skills doesn't make much of a difference.
---
On the other hand, they do have a very useful interaction with the strike missions which gives players an additional CC for breaking the breakbars of the enemy that you can always cap out at the beginning of the encounter.
---
So the different masteries are, as a concept, really interesting but it doesn't really matter for the map itself. The mobs where that would matter die too fast and while there are some effects I never really noticed any difference in their application or how they died.
---
I kind of think the Map itself is just a test area to get accustomed to those mechanics and to learn them for the strike missions or the next episode when they expand the map which could then heavily rely on those rock-paper-scissors mechanics in which you will have a much harder time to fight enemies that you are not strong against.
---
ok boomer
---
I was browsing through wiki/Scepter and I found the concept art and said to myself "Damn! this looks cool, wonder if the concept made it to the game so I can buy this skin!". Oh boy.
---
I still don't see the point. They could done it a lot more lore friendly and simpler to use.
---
Why not just let the ranger solo the 4th ? And do 3rd with dh ? 
---
Is there a difference in range ? Shouldn’t the 4th not even evade if no one is close ?
---
Lol. It isn't raids and fractals are exactly what this game needs because they have good and unique rewards and make it replayable. But hey, I expected such statements. Hope you're proud of yourself now.
---
Here's the real kicker - most open world bosses actually have mechanics, are fairly difficult, and are *fun* to fight. The player upscaling means that individual contributions count for little and bosses will cleave you to death in one hit, making the fights very dull and unfun.
---
They should have just made it so enemies have fixed health/damage and the number of enemies upcales with the number of players. A small team of heroes? You fight a small team of enemies. An army of players? You fight an army of monsters.
---
Harder on the machine to process I'm sure, but scaling is an erratic and hard to understand thing that rarely feels good to deal with, if you even understand its happening at all.
---
Makes me think of Jahai, though to be honest most of Anet's map are chock full of love and detail. It's why people want to see them go back to making more content other than open world - they're damn good at it, and they would be damn good if they applied everything they know to dungeons/fractals/raids in a more consistent manner.
---
If you don't like the new weapon set, then the helmet for the episode is actually baller.
---
&gt; Ok, but this is the GW2 sub. 
---
Was said to stress that to some it very much is not the best MMO out there, and some will have the perspective of not delivering as much as you perhaps might.
---
&gt; Which feature did they promise would be in the Icebrood Saga, and that was definitely *not* delivered by the last episode of it? 
---
This is a well phrased question. It's not easy to come up with a good answer, especially because ANet tends to be very vague when talking about things, looking back. Everything they said about the Boneskinner, for example, "haunting you, setting traps, it'll be a force of nature within the map" are all technically true. I would still argue that it is very much overselling the enemy, however. Especially with the aspect of saying that you'll be "looking over your shoulder constantly for it". It lays traps in the sense that it's just triggers for events that spawn it. Heard someone calling for help? Wait! Oh no, that's a boneskinner!
---
But this is part of the announcement which you agree was overhyped, so I'll provide something else.
---
[In the Long Live the Lich AMA, they talked about raids and fractals.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8vn1t1/long_live_the_lich_ama_summary/) They stated they were committed to one fractal every two episodes, and that production is staggered to where we would see what would turn out to be Mythwright Gambit before what would turn out to be Siren's Reef. And this is a pattern they held until the end of season 4, alternating fractals and raids. Now, should we to disregard that they stated no such commitment to raids as well? That's fair, they didn't say it. Even so, the last episode would mark the next episode to have had a fractal release. If we were to consider the prologue to be an episode, which it honestly should be, then it's now missed two times when a new fractal should've released.
---
Now, all that said, it's also fair to bring up the fact that the AMA was before the layoffs, and the present is afterwards. The amount of layoffs would have a huge impact, undoubtedly, even if it did cause employees to be refocused back onto GW2. But they created a precedent during LS4, stated a commitment, and have not delivered. Are Strike Missions supposed to replace fractal development in their commitment? They should say so. Were they unable to recover from the layoffs in time to do such a release? Even if it was quite a while ago by now, it's not unreasonable to request understanding (and to provide understanding) for a couple of odd episodes where they're getting back on track.
---
But as you say, I agree. It'd just be nice to have more information about what was going on. Whether or not ANet has a history of not divulging much, it's still a bad move on their part, IMO.
---
NA people are generally taught to act happier and not critize people around them.
---
European people dont believe in fairylands where person can Be dead inside but no one will notice
---
A guess, but as good a one as any right now.
---
the dreaded Boneskimmer, its just a skull on a manta ray's body and it glides over Drakkar's ice lake to kill people.
---
Using consumables is like using performance enhancing drugs in sports. You'll get better artificial results but it takes away from the accomplishments.
---
ty :-)
---
thanks ;-)
---
They also come out of Mist portals, and constantly speak of "sleep" and call you a dreamer. They also overtly work for Jormag, talking about how the dragon sends them aid in a reinforcement event and how he steadies their hand in the strike mission.
---
I get the impression that Jormag whispered sweet seductions to them to lure them to his service rather than corrupting/creating them outright, which would make them more akin to mercs than minions. Hoping to get some answers about both the fallen and the abberant in following chapters, this chapter had tons of lore on everything *except* the nature of those two factions.
---
Pokemon is always the answer
---
Ok boomer

GW3?!??
---
&gt;With this comment you just fucked yourself. Trying to overly pretend to not understand that it was sarcasm is the pitiest and most worthless thing one can do in such a situation. 
---
Was. . . *that* sarcasm?
---
Is chill the only weakness those surprise satans have? Brb gonna theorycraft a max chill build to destroy all pocket raptors.

But we can never transfer to Blackgate right? Its been full all year long

It's the highest ranking officer in the Sons of Svanir.
---
Naturally an in game item will never look Just as good as the concept art, but I also think the perspective used in the in game screenshot here doesn't do the thing full justice.
---
That may be an oversight as well, perhaps the wand should have been rolled some 45 degrees in the hand compared to how it is now.
---
Check the rewards for restored boreal weapon collection. There's a scepter and helm.

I'm with you on the names. They are asinine to be so similar.
---
Just no
---
&gt;And even if somebody could crack the tooth, they qualify for little more than being a dragon dentist. Certainly not for killing the damn dragon.
---
Tbh, tooth enamel, regarding humans at least, is stronger than bones, maybe it works the same with dragons. And if it works it means that by being able to pierce a tooth you will be able to pierce every part except maybe the claws.
---
Ye, I'm not sure what the masteries are either, so here's how I see them:  
---
\-I maxed them all out so I can open all chests now
---
\-drop 30 orbs and hit better
---
\-sometimes I get this special action skill so i just instantly waste it on the first thing that's in front of me.
---
Overall, I like the fact that opening chests is tied to masteries (it's a nice alternative to keys), and the extra power is nice (I guess) but I don't feel it at all and it has not altered the way I play my class at all.
---
Also, the thing about an asura teaching the system instead of a norn is a good point. And I know, there are probably role related reasons to it, but still, they missed out on a chance to get better in touch with the norn spirits and shamanism etc.
---
anet could have all the metrics they ever had a wet dream about. that doesn't help with their seemingly completely absent skill of interpreting them unfortunately.
---
when a trend arises they tend to either not heed it at all, or focus obsessively on it to the point they suffocate it. they barely know a middle ground and can't pace themselves. ironic considering that the people unhappy with past releases were constantly accused of almost the same thing.
---
In General Options, set your "Content Guide" (5. dropdown menu from top) to "Disable Personal Story". Sadly that still points often to hearts, but at least on 2nd priority it shows you events. Also open your map frequently and look for the orange symbols.
---
You can always type /wiki NameOfMap into your ingame chat to get to the wiki page for that map. There events and such are listed.
---
Events are the equivalent of quests.
---
Hearts are the equivalent of tasks.
---
Always make sure to kill random mobs and look for the exp they give. The longer a mob has been "unkilled" the more exp it gives. If you find such a high-exp mob, kill everything around it.
---
Dont forget to use your exp boosters. /wiki experience shows you a list of modifiers. The easiest to come by are food, utility consumable, guild exp booster and fireworks. The one from black lion company (usually have "booster" in their name somewhere) Id keep for getting your HoT mastery exp, since that one can drag on.
---
GW2 is a sandbox game, especially up until lvl80. Meaning you get full freedom, with very little guidance. That can be quite daunting if you arent used to it. Bascially, theres no "right way" or even "recommended way" to leveling to lvl80. Me for example, I like to be very focused about it. I unlock all waypoints, heropoints and kill mobs on the way. I only do events when I run out of lower-level maps, and only do a very limited select number of hearts that I need for buying cooking ingredients later on. Then at level 65ish, I craft my way to lvl80. But thats just me, I have 10k+ hours on the game and sightseeing got boring quite a while ago ;)
---
When you are new to the game, Id really suggest: enjoy the game. The events are quite fun, the sights are stunning, the jumping puzzles are challenging. Avoid sticking to one region for too long, always keep on exploring. No worries, you wont run out of maps to explore.
---
While I haven't played the new chapter yet (a leggy derailed me....) so I can't add my opinion on it, but I do want to thank you for coming here and sharing the reasoning behind the degisn for these mechanics.  
---
I can comment on the difficulty bit, that one of the hardest parts of Open world is the CC bar for scaled enemies. If you have a 50 people squad, but only 10 people know what a CC is some encounters actually become impossible to complete. On top of my head there's a bounty in the desolation and one of the istan pirates that regenerate if you don't break them. The joko event in jahai is the same. This leads to cases where you wouldn't want to draw attention to some of these events if you want to do them or not joining/helping if a group needs help. Sort of the opposite of the general open world design where you should always be happy to see another player.  
---
I don't have a problem with punishing mechanics in instanced content (although there is still a surprising amount of people in T4 who don't know how to cc...)  
---
While this isn't directly related to the mastery or this chapter specifically, I think the CC mechanic in openworld needs some work. Either reducing the punishment for not breaking or teaching people this mechanic better.  
---
I won't even talk about combo fields, I'll admit I have 12k AP and 1500 hours and combo fields for me is 'staff3+staff2=condi cleanse'.
---
Hall of Chains was a pretty strong candidate for a follow-up raid, and PoF has 3 vs HoT's 4 raids. But I can't really say whether or not that's "filling out their commitment" to PoF raids, either. You still need PoF to access Icebrood Saga, thus it's still within PoF's purview and lifecycle as far as I'm concerned. The push/distinction/branding that it's the *saga* and not LS5 is rather meaningless, seeming like weak technicalities to me. Technicalities that do not change that it is living story and split into episodes, which is what they made the fractal commitment in regards to. 
---
Yes, they didn't say it was for Icebrood Saga, but would you be able to tell me just what they *have* promised for Icebrood Saga specifically? Communication lately hasn't been exactly robust and they really don't, as far as I've noticed, make an effort to be that specific or careful with what they talk about. Should they be more careful? Maybe. After all, there was no comment that they were committing for the remainder of S4 only. At the point of the AMA it was only one more fractal for the season, anyways. There'd be better ways to phrase it that wouldn't set things up for potential misunderstandings like this if they didn't mean it for how they were doing/wanting to do episodes in general.
---
I would like to say that I don't feel *owed* a raid or a fractal. I might be wrong and feel it more subconsciously, even if I don't even do the raids. They've also managed to put out raids while doing just as much if not more with other episodes, IMO. That said, expectations and entitlement formed by any given individual all on their own for all of this stuff is rather awful, honestly. Most often it won't end with that person being pleased. It's going to happen, though, and what ANet could do is make more of an effort-- or even *an* effort-- to temper expectations. Respond more meaningfully to feedback/expectations. Might just be a pipe dream, but if there's a rather large amount of people feeling similarly about the episode being unsatisfactory, it might not be the worst thing for them to do.
---
Overall, you make many good points despite me not fully agreeing with them. If there was any one thing you've said that I cannot agree with at all, however, I would have to disagree with you about only being able to say that things have been underdelivered after the final episode of the saga. Complaints about this episode *are* feedback, though much of it isn't constructive at all. Feedback is important, especially for the episodic kind of release that they want. If it could only be judged by the end of the season, then it should've just been one full piece of content as an expansion in the first place.
---
That part still makes no sense to me. Why would Primordus be asleep if he's low on reserves? Being low on reserves is the very thing that causes the ED cycle to start.
---
i was just saying to myself that there are other passages i should explore for the sake of it, where you use a shrine and follow the raven as it glides through the corridors, but your map says i shouldnt bother.
---
Is that all, actually? A boring encounter with few actual mechanics doesn't suddenly become interesting just because you increase numbers a bit.
---
This. But... what does difficulty mean to players and AN? 
---
A memory test - you need to remember 15 skills/mechanics/phases
---
A sight test - you need to spot 1shot aoe on the ground while you're stacked with 9 other people covering the ground with your own aoes.
---
Something else?
---
I love open world bosses but most story/raid/strike bosses come down to the same design - being closed in a tiny room with fatass boss spraying the floor with bad things and npcs/other players doing the same thing to the boss.
---
The system sounded both boring and convoluted on its face when they announced it. Experiencing it firsthand has not improved anyone's opinion I imagine. 
---
ANet can do better than this. ANet needs to do better than this.
---
We already got the new logo, and you want more?
---
These entitled toxic manbaby hater elitists are the plague of the game! RRREEEEEE

&gt;Hall of Chains was a pretty strong candidate for a follow-up raid, and PoF has 3 vs HoT's 4 raids. But I can't really say whether or not that's "filling out their commitment" to PoF raids, either. You still need PoF to access Icebrood Saga, thus it's still within PoF's purview and lifecycle as far as I'm concerned. 
---
Well, "as far as you're concerned" isn't really "as far as *they* are concerned." You need to buy PoF because it's part of the "you paid something" content, not the "F2P" content, but it's not part of the PoF package, because that only included *one* season of LS. They discharged their obligations to PoF customers as soon as that chapter launched.
---
&gt;Yes, they didn't say it was for Icebrood Saga, but would you be able to tell me just what they have promised for Icebrood Saga specifically?
---
Not a whole lot, most of which is already in the game. This is my point. A lot of people are just assuming expectations onto them and then getting upset that they never delivered. I mean, I could just assume that Amazon is going to send me an Occulus Quest, but that doesn't give me the right to yell at their CS staff if they don't. 
---
&gt;It's going to happen, though, and what ANet could do is make more of an effort-- or even an effort-- to temper expectations.
---
Perhaps, but it's really shitty marketing when a company has to keep repeating "don't get *too* excited, it won't be all that great." I don't blame a company for allowing expectations to exist unchallenged. I only blame them if they *say* they will deliver on something and then *fail* at it, without a reasonable justification. 
---
&gt;If there was any one thing you've said that I cannot agree with at all, however, I would have to disagree with you about only being able to say that things have been underdelivered after the final episode of the saga. Complaints about this episode are feedback, though much of it isn't constructive at all. 
---
It's a matter of degrees. People can play episode 1, and they can right fairly say things like "this was short," "I wish it were longer," "I don't feel that this is especially 'expansion worthy,'" even "if this trend *continues,* it will be a disappointing season." 
---
What I do *not* feel is justified is people taking the position that because ep1 was short, then entire season *is* doomed, or that because the features introduced in ep1 alone would not be worthy of purchasing an expansion, that *the season as a whole* is already not living up to that claim. I think it's perfectly reasonable for them to portion out new features, to distribute content unevenly, and for that to be a good thing overall. I think it's fine to critique ep1 as ep1, but we're a long way from being able to make any valid criticism of "Icebrood Saga" as a whole. 
---
Feedback is important, histrionics is not.
---
Once you have all three maxed out you are back to not having to think about them because you can pick up every orb, open every chest and don't have any disadvantages. The system is very confusing at the start and completely obsolete once you're done. I am not a fan if these masteries.
---
&gt; I think we finally hit the point where the open world content is suffering
---
I mean, everything has been going down. PvE is the core, but it can't survive alone. It was just a matter of time.
---
What you do is up to you. All that matters here is that you cannot judge a season by a single episode (or two, for that matter). If you don't like this episode, that's fine, and you can let them know that, but anyone that was expecting this episode to just dump everything you'd get day one out of an expansion was not understanding what was going on. The expansion is the entire *season,* not just the first episode.
---
According to [this](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html) the rayzen is slightly better than the i5 at single core performance, which is the important metric for gw2.
---
&gt; For me the worst part is that every and any game after a certain amount of time desperately needs an overhaul to keep itself fresh
---
New elite specializations were a must for this "saga" to work, and they didn't even bother. Biggest mistake.
---
&gt;Or just make this game subscription based so they can finally hire more devs,do proper marketing and stop with this gem-store bullshit.
---
Gem store subscription could work as well, as long as they address the overpriced problems the gem store already has.
---
Guild missions.
---
Legendary armor fix.
---
Hair styles and other cosmetic options.
---
Bigger and bigger letdowns.
---
You can't work with data alone, you need to understand the context, and for that, you need people who actually play the game and understand where the data comes from, and why it is the way it is.
---
Content not popular? Abandon it, and make a new thing. That's all they do, they never strengthen what they have, they never fix the problems, they never ask why the content is not popular.
---
Thanks! Indeed i was looking for it in the npc page
---
No, you arent "officially a boomer" because of this.
---
I just hate that the fellblade was made into a 2h sword instead of being kept 1h. Yes I know about that purple one. The coolest look of the fellblade by far was also when you dyed it black in GW1. Wish they kept that version.
---
Was it really meatier tho? You got every 2 months a lackluster map (IMO all maps from LS3 are lackluster in one way or another) some mastery that you would unlock really quickly and 2-3h of story. The story was no where near the level of story we had in this ep. 
---
LS3 had raids and fractals being released, but here we had the strike missions. Again if they make strike missions raid-like challenges, then with a 2 month release cadence, I think LS5 will be just the same as LS3 but with better maps and story.
---
Adapt, overcome, improvise : )
---
Finally, Droobert has a use.
---
Arenanet doesnt want people to play group content
---
I was really sad when [this awesome design](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/e/e6/Favor_of_the_Colossus_concept_art.jpg) turned into [this oversized plastic monstrosity](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Favor_of_the_Colossus)!
---
I won't be hunting for much evidence as I don't have time for that, but: there was an interview where they stated that it's important for the company's health to keep working on side projects; there's newly hired (as in, 1-2 years) Anet developers on twitter that are not and have never been involved with GW2; former CEO Mike O'Brien was working with a small team on a prototype for a new game after the lay-offs and before they left to form a new company (ManaWorks) recently (this info was in a Kotaku's article, and later confirmed by one of the developers himself, Isaiah Cartwright, somewhere in ManaWork's newly created subreddit page).
---
You can also look at GW2 itself. It used to have around 200 employees working on it during HoT/ PoF days, which allowed Anet to work on LW and expansions simultaneously, plus raids, fractals, etc. Currently, Anet has 250+ employees and hiring, yet GW2 has no expansions in sight, barely any support outside of LW seasons, and LW5 is so far relatively short and light compared to previous seasons. So unless half the company is just slacking, they're working on something else.
---
Anet is an game experiment company, they want to create new things not to maintain a game
---
&gt;that's something I never noticed. You might bring this idea to official forum of it bothers you. 
---
And he'll probably get banned for it
---
Previous ceo lost interest in gw2.and wanted to do other things. He failed and ran away. Now arenanet is fighting for survival with cutting costs after lay offs.
---
What? Throughout their entire history, they have released 2 games. Not a lot of experimentation going on here.
---
***Okay Boomer***
---
Well, when you ask the Asura if that's not abusing the power of the spirits, the dude is like; "Yeah, isn't it great?!" Soo, I'm guessing that's why it's an Asura explaining it.
---
The haunting, disturbing, creepy etc. content they keep referring to is nowhere to be seen in the actual content. 
---
And who didn't immediately pick up Almorra's "phone call" was Jormag?
---
I think this is cool story and map. So much cool content, cool events (very cool meta event), cool enemies and cool achievements.
---
&gt;Frankly I don't even see the logic in doing GW3 right now as GW2 has so much more to give. Why not hire some people whose only job is to reinvigorate the engine. Get it working for dx12, sort out the spaghetti code. Graphically the game is a pretty as anything else. That isn't an issue. Gameplay wise, the combat is still awesome. What is really going on??
---
Lose $400,000 per year with for no noticeable return in revenue? This isn't like *RuneScape* getting yet another graphical upgrade; Gw3 is a better idea.
---
The AMD Ryzen 7 3700X will definitely perform better (and use less energy!)
---
Leave it to Anet to take an interesting and promising new game mechanic (like they did with combos) and then trivialize it in practice, and in this case, also make it a convoluted grind to gate to new content.
---
I have just walked off the warning AoE before actual arrow hits the ground. When you see the warning AoE, instantly start walking out of it. My ping is around 200.

That's it? That was the entirety of the response?

A boneskinner that shoots missiles....is this part of the lore? 😹

And necromancers
---
&gt; If we're deep in Norn territory, and these masteries represent aspects of the Spirits of the Wild or other Norn tomfoolery, why is there an Asura attempting to science my magic instead of a Norn teaching me?
---
Because it's based on asuran torture science. The implications of what you do and how the asura got it to work are fucking dark, and it's very unlikely that any norn would've done that.
---
Madking lab is open 14days over 360 and you don't get anything by doing it 30sec per day
---
You can experiment in two games. though. I don't know a lot of games that have released mounts like the mounts in this game. A lot of the things done in this game are being copied by others.  I mean I can name other games that had dynamic events, but none that had done away with quest hubs.
---
the biggest problem I have is the fact that Anet is just now creating/developing Saga story and they are just somewhere around chapter 2-3. That is a huge undertaking and I am not sure Anet can pull it off and I expect delays and a good number of bugs. Possibly even burnout from employees so they will go "well fuck that I am out, I need a schedule that makes sense and not this rubbish month after month deadline"
---
Seven years of diversity hires hacking away at the source code. It has become completely unmaintainable.
---
"different group comp"
---
Ofc it ends up being personal preference.  
---
For me personally as I can not speak for others, seeing cons being used on bosses outside of art feels like you cant even come up with a way to cc the boss and you resulted in using outside sources such as cc consumables.  In other words the kill in one way or another looks dogshit because of the cons for me.
---
This does not disregard the fact you can use it and there is again nothing wrong with it. But also on that note, It was also a mutual thing that many did not do and felt like there was no need for it to be used in fractals. there are plenty of stuff that are part of that, cons being one. boosters being another.   
---
But after all people can do what they want to do :shrug:
---
While those did take place, they weren't all required for a replacement. Specifically the second and the last three.
---
We don't quite know why Glint was chosen, but it was likely due to being a scion rather than merely a champion, and had nothing to do with seeing the future. Aurene and Vlast were originally meant to replace *other* Elder Dragons, and consuming Joko wasn't really a requirement (honestly the "three signs" thing including the death of a lich feels like an asspull to help quell how some folks disliked his sudden death), and we had known how to kill Kralkatorrik without Kralkatorrik telling us (Glint said the same thing about piercing his heart with the spear in EoD, and even then, that could be deduced after the rest of his body stops functioning).
---
In reality, replacing an Elder Dragon is as simple as finding something that can become an Elder Dragon (e.g., a scion and as implied with Tequatl, any dragon champion) and getting them to be friendlier than the current Elder Dragons. For all we know, the Pale Tree is a valid candidate and just needs to get her act together / a nice heaping of Mordy-juice to replace Mordremoth.
---
Have you used a timer to find out when those events spawn, and LFG to see where the active map is?  /wiki et from in game will bring up the timer.
---
As for Dragon Stand, most of the time if you get there ten minutes early, you'll see a commander tag. Join the squad. The map you're on will close and you'll die (unless you're mounted) and you'll end up on a new map. Make sure you're on the same map as the commander and if not join on them. Then you're good to go.
---
Ah, yes, the classic "give it time" argument that the live service model loves to preach about. Even though it's been what, 7 years?
---
So... what you're saying is imported Blood Oranges are a gateway food.
---
Those portals are called "Fallen Portals" and as far as I've seen, no dialogue suggesting they're Mist portals, so I don't think we can rightly call them portals to the Mists.
---
And this episode does have plenty on the nature of aberrants, there's not much to say beyond "created from souls fractured by Sons of Svanir necromancers" beyond depicting how the necromancers learned this. Though I do think it'd be interesting to find out why these armies have essences of the Spirits of the Wild, and how those Spirits related to the armies (if they do).
---
&gt; We're ArenaNet. We make the games we want to play a reality, and infuse them with *innovation*, hand-crafted detail, and creative passion.  
---
They recreate the weel all the time. Their code is spaghetti and not made to get upgrades. They move all their ressources on other projects. They move from one extreme to the other. They don't care about their community, don't communicate. Because the head is bored of gw2, moved on, and just want to do their new ideas. And they can't because of ncsoft so they are doing the minimum.
---
Yes. This. Please!!
---
It's held sidewise so the image from the wiki doesn't see those details. But you can tell they're there. Main difference is the positioning of the talons - in-game, they're equidistant, while in the concept art they look like a more proper hand.
---
You have the best combat system in the MMO market and you take no advantage of it.
---
Hahahaha, BDO says hi.
---
You have the best PvP on the market and you let it rot to hell.
---
BnS does competitive better, BDO and ESO do large scale better.
---
Just FYI, check out The Art of Guild Wars 2 book, it's full of amazing concept art and art that got into the game as loading screens :)
---
*Some* people always cared. Sure. Just never *enough* people. Never enough to justify them putting any more effort into making "fetch" happen. 
---
When I say "nobody cared," I wasn't being literal. I just mean "nobody who *mattered* cared."
---
And elitysm 'show me your SpecialCurrency or kick'
---
Eitrite ingots are needed for the new 32 slot bags so there is residual value to doing this 5 minute mission daily.
---
Pvp is arguable, but WvW? This is still likely the best RvR game, almost u contested and after seven fucking years of seeing barely any non-damaging updates.
---
Most dedicated WvW players were also big spenders and loyal to the grave (or Scourge Introduction). It's beyond insane how Arenanet had managed to ignore the single fucking gamemode they undoubtly had on all the other MMOs with a huge following (2012-2014 WvW was probably bigger than PvE and pvp combined).
---
same thought here.
---
both dragons got "drained" of energy during the fight ...which...(taimi said) put them back to pre-awakening -energy-level. And she further guesses that the same thing is happening to jormag.  
---
But Dragons with low energy...awake, feed and destroy...they dont ... sit back and wait.  
---
then again - jormag was far away and got not drained as hard as primordius...
---
Spirit grenades!
---
After all we play on level 80 zones but if feels more like we are still stuck in Queensdale. The Risen in Orr with their pulls, chill and immobilize are more of a problem than any mob in Bjora Marches. There should be some expectations to the player when playing in post expansion maps.
---
Amen to that!
---
It's dx12, and yes if your machine can utilize it
---
They've been focused on the living world for ages. They only added raids for example with the first expansion and they haven't been that fast in adding more. You have to ask yourself why.
---
There are probably a dozen MMOs that have raids in them. Plenty of PvP options available for people who like that including Mobas and open world PvP in BDO and Archeage. It's an already occupied niche.
---
No one has an open world like Guild Wars 2 though.
---
This. It's basically like choosing between an i7 and i5, and I would most definitely choose i7 if I were able (i.e. get the Ryzen 7 3700X). I think it's a no brainer.
---
People join to teleport into the map.
---
It also works with conjures, shrouds and firebrand tomes, and pretty much any bundle you were holding before bring transformed.
---
You can say they experiment in GW2, but is that not maintaining GW2? Everything they have released since the launch of GW2, has exclusively been for GW2.
---
It's not exactly like this is a company that launches a new wacky game, with a wacky concept every year. They have released two games, and even if they try and do things differently in these games, they try and keep them going. Even though GW1 stopped development almost a decade ago, they keep the servers up and running, and don't seem to have any plans to shut them down. Even though they did take people off GW2 to work on other projects until NCsoft told them to cut the shit, they kept development going for GW2. These are big signs that Anet cares very much about maintaining their games, rather than just releasing something to quickly drop it for their next experiment. That might be how they handle development inside GW2 with how many story lines they dropped, and how things like dungeons where just killed, and how fractals might be heading the same way, but they do care very much about keeping GW2 maintained.
---
So boomers are bad?
---
Lol.
---
Alright.
---
&gt;No one has an open world like Guild Wars 2 though
---
ESO has an even better one, where you can make actual choices in your quests akin to a single player game, with various options of completions... which can range from making you a wanted criminal in certain regions, to an honorary member of npc guilds.
---
Guildwars is pretty bare bones in that regard. Sure they have interesting metas, but those metas lose their charm when everything dies to autoattacks.
---
&gt; Why not hire some people whose only job is to reinvigorate the engine. Get it working for dx12, sort out the spaghetti code.
---
While i agree the engine is a huge problem and they shouldn't have saddled with the already outdated gw1 engine, I wouldn't say its a worthy investment of their resources to make this game working on dx12, when the unofficial dx12 proxy fixes most of the fps problems.
---
There are other problems with the engine with limits heavily what they can do with the game nowadays, which they could only fix if the would remake the engine entirely from scratch or rehire the original devs of the engine.
---
Where both options is practically imposable...
---
As bad as the game might look for some people, it makes consistent profit, so i dont see it being "closed" any time soon.
---
Except that GW2 has been, and still continues to be the most profitable title they have in the West.
---
Wildstar failed to find it's market. GW2 has found theirs. While us on the forums might like PvP, and raids, and the hardcore options GW2 provides, the casual market is what funds this game. They enjoy simple, grindy updates that don't require them to be good at the game. This is why Anet focuses so much on these updates.
---
Every other NCsoft title in the West is in much more danger of being shutdown than GW2 is.
---
The point of this mastery is to explicitly show every (possibly new) player what masteries are, that there's a new set for the season, and that you have to click them to get started. Similar to metroidvania zones with new pickups, you are roadblocked until you learn the new thing; it's just that this one goes into UI zone and blends with a tutorial.
---
It's not dead. It's not done often either. A lot of people seem to be unaware that it was nerfed and it's much easier than it used to be.
---
The best way to get it done if no one else is doing it, is to pop a tag early and build a group yourself. List it in LFG. Announce it in map chat. That how I've gotten it when I've needed it.
---
I use RGB, which is a pretty common acronym.
---
I don't think most casuals are moving. I tried ESO and found the combat disappointing and the jumping felt like I was floating. Sure the quests are nice in the voiced aspect, but I actually found running back and forth to a guy and following a star was not my thing anymore. I didn't prefer it to what I have here.
---
It's pointless, like most of the other masteries. I mean, had it been a t5 or t6 mastery, it would have been cool, but being unlocked so soon (and with no real use, just opening places that should be open anyway, or chest rooms) makes it completely pointless.
---
Now, if we had needed essence to use it, that would be another thing. At least it isn't as stupid as the "you can now collect unbound magic" crap we got in the first episode of both LW3 and LW4.
---
It's sad to see masteries have fallen so low from what they were supposed to be (metroidvania character progression) but whatever.
---
The second one (raven shield) is pretty pointless as well, and actually ruins the freeze mechanic, which would have been better if it forced you to go near heat every few seconds or whatever. At least it doesn't suck as much as the cancer that is Bitterfrost Frontier's thaw elixir.
---
Because they wanted to timegate the underwhelming standard rewards from chests.
---
At least that system nudged you to tinker with builds suited to exploring specific parts of the island, and the rotating wheel was neat to play with.
---
Still very much an oldschool grind; definitely not for me, thanks.
---
Anet is still making 12 million dollars a quarter or more. Wildstar was nowhere near that. I'm not sure it ever hit those numbers. Saying something like this is just silly. You need to do more research before you make this kind of claim.
---
&gt;the ANet promotion for it seemed fairly standard, about at the level they do on any release
---
Ah yeah, they do live announcements for every release or living story chapter, I forgot.
---
Hence this post - they've got some re-thinking to do. :)
---
It's a tutorial.   
---
We asked for those. 
---
I believe it might also be victim of a before-release rework, or the devs just felt like adding some of them throughout the map
---
Rewards in gemstore.
---
So they should never add unique rewards again in case it will have ridiculous droprate. What kind of backwards thinking is that? 
---
Raids show it can be done. I think their unique rewards have droprate set quite well and it could easily be brought into strikes.
---
Without unique rewards strike missions will die pretty fast.
---
&gt;not a lot of people seems to be aware of it.
---
Or just not everyone agrees. I think unidentified is absolutely fine, it makes me more excited for loot since it doesn't clutter up my inventory. What killed the reward aspect for me was the removal of unique currencies, so I can either instabuy everything and have no incentive to play the new map, or have to RNG grind stuff out instead of progressing towards a reward so I don't have any incentive to play the new map.
---
And $400k per year is a very generous estimate. That gives you ~5 developers according to ziprecruiters average salary chart for Arenanets area.
---
I think they would have to spend much more to refactor their code and upgrade/rewrite their engine.
---
If a new engine would make sense financially they would have probably done it, but I think we shouldn't underestimate how many people get turned of because their $1500 computer can't break 60 FPS in this game. I've seen plenty of posts about that.
---
The entire list of masteries from the new map is nothing more than contrived filler. Frankly i wish they hadn't bothered
---
And Angie has a vagina
---
the meta is dead cos is boring , doesn't have rewards or something really usefull...
---
Episode 1 is part of the whole saga. If they're hyping it up to be, then deconfirming all actual expansion features (Raids, Fractals, Elite Specs, etc.) and not even delivering anything resembling an expansion feature yet, they've insanely overhyped it.
---
Sure they can, but that is intentionally avoiding it, therefore not something that can be taken into account.
---
Why would i think the president is useless?
---
Im pretty sure we asked for something meaningful.
---
This game is basically just fancy movie you can move on your own. Nothing has any weight or meaning these days, which is basic principle of MMO.
---
This is like your 7th 'GW2 is trash' post in the past week. It's cool to have an opinion, but buddy you need to chill.
---
They shouldn't have ridiculous drop rates. But honestly they should've add a currency you can get via doing the strike that lets you exchange for specific item drops. dungeon/frac/raid all have currency you can get to exchange for goods. for example with raids you can purchase 1-2 ascended piece of gear every week if you clear your wings. The more extreme items like the portal and chair are priced at around 10 weeks of full clearing.
---
first of all, WP builds are absolute trash despite what the reddit casuals that never stepped in a raid believe..on a similar note, most guides are pretty bad
---
best way to learn a class is simply playing and reading what your skills, traits etc. do exactly..oh and especially soloing bosses teaches you a lot about your build
---
if soloing stuff is daunting, you can always look at [others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1Ib6Lo05LY)
---
there is a skill priority in terms of damage but everything is situational..for example you might want to reset your warden instead of swordsman if you need better aoe or projectile mitigation
---
refreshing your clones asap usually only matters for mirage! you do want to shatter with 3 clones in most cases but doing a 1 clone f3 shatter for cc is perfectly fine if the situation calls for it(or even to get some alacrity back to gain access to an important skill faster)
---
as you can see, it's all situational with some rough guidelines really! just keep playing it and you'll be fine
---
Yes. This is my last post about guild wars 2. I quit this game already and now Im leaving everything releated to this game. I don't want to be related with this scam company anymore. I just felt like I have to throw out everything I feel. Now I can move on.
---
You should at least have some chance to complete it on days with the Vabbi events daily.
---
Yeah, it's nice. If anything, i'd add some stuff like a couple of minis as rewards, but the bag materials are already very useful.
---
The ingame version actually looks [almost the same as the concept art](https://imgur.com/vCeQDKz) except for the fingertips and the blue orb. 
---
The picture you took has just a bad angle and a very bad resolution, because you stretched it. 
---
[The picture from wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/a/ab/Wayward_Wand_Scepter.jpg) has a better resolution, but still didn't used max graphic settings.
---
For like 2 years since it was introduced? LMAO.
---
&gt; Fellblade is even worse. Expectation vs reality
---
It's literally the same skin as in [GW1](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Fellblade).
---
I'm not really trying to argue if it is or not, but what type of content that they think of, when thinking of expansion quality. That kind of content, more or less, is what we are getting. I mean this in contrast to people thinking it means elite specs. That's not what Anet is thinking about.
---
&gt; It is not even a proper lock, since everyone who gets into the map through story gets it unlocked within 15 seconds without even levelling it properly.
---
It's the same with gliding in HoT and the Raptor in PoF. There too, you unlock the mastery within 15 secons without even levelling it properly.
---
can you pls stop try to speak for "most casuals".
---
and btw: who says you only can play one or the other? I play GW2 and ESO for years side by side.  I wont leave any of these games until they shut down.
---
tbh all this "leaving and never coming back" is totally stupid imo.
---
Yes I agree. I do wish there were a few random rewards of some sort
---
The best time to run it is probably right after reset. There's a lot of people that run all the HoT/PoT metas right after reset for the amalgamated gemstones
---
EDIT: iirc TTT does serpent's ire once a week. I'd check out their calendar
---
I totally agree, but people cried and whined so hard that the shoulders were rng.
---
Disagree on basically all points, but that's what opinions are. The good thing about unidentified that you still get the worthwile drops (rares and exotics) in addition to the unidentifieds. You also don't have to salvage them and can just sell the stack instead of having to either salvage or sell every worthless boring piece of blue or green you get. Salvaging as you play is still annoying, having to stop gameplay pretty often for inventory management is dumb. Unidentifieds did a lot to improve both loot and general gamaplay for GW2 IMO.
---
GW1 was not a good loot system IMO. A ton too convoluted. Having to loot an item &gt; buy an identification kit &gt; identify the item &gt; buy a salvage kit &gt; salvage or sell the item just for some basic pieces of loot is too much busywork. Skins (with no wardrobe system in place) and upgrades (that you need to individually sell) still feel like busywork. Unique items are nice, but GW2 also has those for bosses ( could use a few more though).
---
you're correct of course. first time trying to add anything to the maptimer file, and i was going off the event timer wiki page, which doesnt have a prep block listed for the meta.
---
`&lt;Map Name="Borja Marches" Length="120" Start="0" id="s5bm"&gt;`
---
`&lt;Event Name="Icebrood Champions" Length="15" Color="8065b0e8"/&gt;`
---
`&lt;Event Name="" Length="80" Color="00000000"/&gt;`
---
`&lt;Event Name="Prep" Length="5" Color="8065b0e8"/&gt;`
---
`&lt;Event Name="Raven Shrines" Length="10" Color="8065b0e8"/&gt;`
---
`&lt;Event Name="Shards and Construct" Length="10" Color="804199d8"/&gt;`
---
`&lt;/Map&gt;`
---
People just turn off their brain and do hots meta like they have been doing since hots released. no new content, no new more efficient farm pattern will convince braindead players to do something else. They would rather have 200 blue bags of shit in their inventory than play something that requires slightly more participation.
---
Reddit drama doesn't matter. You don't see this shit in the actual game.
---
Easy? Yes
---
Fun? No. Fuck finding the zealots. Why are they scattered around the desert? The meta takes way too long
---
&gt;This would be more like canceling a movie, promising a TV series with movie quality, cancelling many beloved parts of that movie (raids, fractals, elite specs), then severely underdelivering with the first episode.
---
So, like, if you had a multi-billion dollar movie franchise, let's use. . . Star Wars, just as an example, and if you released a TV series based on that franchise onto your much hyped streaming service, and if the second episode of that TV series was slightly shorter than the first, than what people were expecting, say 31 minutes instead of 39, that obviously slight to the audience would have been justification to declare the entire season "ruined?" 
---
&gt;The pilot of a TV series needs to draw people in. 
---
This isn't a pilot though. This is season 5. We know the basics of what's going on here, most of the audience that *might* be in is *already* in. But just as some long running TV series play around with expectations and early episodes in a season might be different than people are expecting, that season *might* turn out to be the best one yet. 
---
&gt; You can easily judge a TV series before seeing an entire season.
---
No, you can't. You can have an *opinion* on it, sure. And maybe your opinion on it will be accurate, either by dumb luck, or because nothing much changes over the course of the season. But you can't *judge* the season, as in *fairly* determining its worth, without seeing the entire scope of it, any more than you could *fairly* judge a court case based only on the opening argument. 
---
If you want to quit after one episode, that's fine, there are only so many hours in the day and you shouldn't have to play something that you aren't enjoying, but at the same time, you can't fairly *judge* it based only on partial knowledge.
---
I did not think about it like that. This makes Jormag so much more horrifying.
---
"Ill kill you, you won't be a hero. You will die slowly, probably painfully, and alone with nobody to save you."
---
What a scary thought, especially for characters which are known as being heroic leaders. Not a way you want to be remembered.
---
They care about the combat system and how it feels. They simply don't care about maximizing their damage output or stuff like that. You know, kind of like how the average player likes fighting games: they like how the moves look and feel, but they don't give a shit about frame data.
---
Maybe Anet didn't want to bother creating unique rewards for all strikes in episode 2. Yet because they are on a rotating schedule also don't want people to farm all rewards on the first week. 
---
As a result perhaps only the third strike has unique rewards? Would be a weird execution but I could see it.
---
They genuinely sound like a team that just wants to make a single player game
---
Check his posting history. Every single submission in this subreddit.
---
&gt;Contact support, they might be of help.
---
I sent a ticket, not really expecting a reply because it was completely my own fault, but they replaced it within 24 hours. Thanks for the help!
---
If tier 2 opens chests, what does tier 1 of the masteries do?
---
This right here. Current market if you can afford the 3rd Gen Ryzen get one of those. The first generations before the 3rd have horrible Single Thread performance compared to their Intel counterparts. Now the 3rd gen actually rival Intel in the single thread performance category.
---
It's not dead, it's just rarely done because it requires IQ and coordination slightly above a pack of retarded spastic monkeys using skill 1. If you can read this post and have frontal lobe, then you're almost overqualified for it. Remember that you're not the Atlas though, you can't carry them all.
---
You forget im the commander, i’m not a dragon dentist.   Im a dragon killer. Zhaitan gave up on life when i shot my load into him. Mordremoth wet his roots when he saw me. Kralkatorrik cried for his mommy when i punched him in the face.
---
If i was jormag i would be terrified and probably wet the bed if i hear that the commander is coming him.
---
It's also not done as often because it's much easier to do Forged with Fire instead, a lot of people do it at reset instead of Serpent's Ire.
---
I wonder if the more casual players, who never post in communities, actually do use these NPCs and consumable NPC summons. I know I never bothered to after the days of Fire Elemental Powder went past, but maybe ANet's statistics show that solo players use those as henchmen. Otherwise why they would've even bothered increasing the amount of simultaneously summoned NPCs this patch...
---
In other words, they introduced powercreep
---
&gt; Severe understatement of what happened here. It's not just short, it has a ton of issues that ANet is seemingly proud of (Boneskinner for example).
---
Well, there are things to be proud about. I watched the guildchat, and the visual and audio design on it, for example, are great. But they have already admitted that the gameplay balance for it is not great. Ultimately, it's one forgettable boss fight, not a big deal. 
---
&gt;Marketed as a Saga, specifically different and grander in scale than seasons, but with the smallest Living Story patch since season 2 where they were biweekly.
---
Again though, we don't yet know the pacing of their release schedule, nor the scale of future patches. I've pointed out numerous times that I think the length of the story in this one was perfect for the story they set out to tell here (any longer would have felt padded out and reduced the tension), and the map is the right size for the content they want to put in it. Now, if this season consists *only* of six chapters no bigger than this one? If it consists only of six maps no bigger than this one? *Then,* once that has been determined, I would be disappointed in it. But one thing I **want** from them shifting from "seasons" to "sagas" is for them to *be* more flexible in their design. I *want* them to mix smaller releases and larger ones as the content dictates. I *want* them to release new abilities as they make sense to the flow of the plot, rather than getting them all at once at the beginning. 
---
Will I be disappointed? Maybe, but it'll take at the very minimum several episodes for me to have any idea on that, and the entire season before I can give a definitive answer. 
---
&gt;Except that worth is something subjective. If something takes more than a year to deliver, I can definitely consider it a failure nonetheless. 
---
Again, you can form an opinion whenever you like. You can decide that a defendant is guilty before the trial even starts, if you want. But that should not be confused for a fair *judgement.* 
---
Like I said, you can bail any time you want, nobody is trying to take that choice away from you. You just can't make any claims as to the overall quality of the product without sufficient evidence, and you can't get that evidence until the season is done. If you want to walk out of a movie fifteen minutes in and declare "I didn't like it," then that's fine, you have that option, but it's not a *fair* judgement of the film as a whole. 
---
&gt; There won't be elite specs. 
---
You don't know that. 
---
&gt;There won't be fractals or raids for the coming few episodes in the least, breaking countless promises. 
---
They never promised fractals or raids as part of any content post s4. Ideally though, you'll be right on this one.
---
&gt;Strikes so far are shit, and they don't want to make future ones much harder so they're tremendously failing at their purpose.
---
Eh. I don't really do Strikes, so whatever, but they always have room to improve them. These are new systems, and if people want some more options, they likely can provide them. 
---
&gt;The prologue was a glorified festival, the first episode was a total disappointment.
---
A lot of people loved the Prologue, *including* its festival components. The rock show was one of the most positively received pieces of content they've added. I was a bit disappointed in the scale of the first episode, but I thought the story it told was a good one. If the rest of the season holds up, then it'll be a good start. If the rest of the season falls short, then it won't be well remembered. 
---
&gt;I can already say that whatever it delivers, those points already make it worthless to me.
---
So you genuinely believe that even if the second episode included elite specs, a new raid wing, a map bigger and more content-packed than any before it, and five hours of story content, it was dead on arrival because you didn't like these two chapters?
---
Fair.
---
2012: 119k. 2015: 40k. 2017: 30k. 2019: only 12k. 2021: ?. It may really drop below 10k.
---
Agreed, but it also unlocks easter egg visions like Asgier with Jormags tooth. But you'veseen it once and ot becomes useless again.
---
Thank you, I'll have a look and for sure come back to you.
---
The best CPU is probably i9 9900k the new CPU has boosts on all cores but reviews are saying it isn’t worth the price hike since performance gains are very low or worse than the regular k
---
According to snowcrows, you want to run rune of the thief on power warrior in raids (https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/warrior/banner/).
---
For fractals, discretize currently says to go scholar runes (https://discretize.eu/builds/warrior/banner-warrior).  Please note, that is because discretize is assuming you have the precision buffs from fractal potions.  If you don't have that, I believe thief runes would be the better choice in fractals as well.  
---
I have no idea if those are both up to date. Also, in a solo setting (open world pve), obviously things are a bit different. My guess is for open world pve, if the enemy dies in less than 25 seconds (the might from, 'for great justice'), the might duration from strength runes is useless and scholar runes are better.  I would guess that in an extended fight in a solo situation, if the fight lasts long enough, strength runes would be better.
---
I will be very disappointed if devs miss the opportunity with the Hall of Monuments. The new map is so close.
---
Wet noodles are always the answer! Good call.
---
The number of Eitrite Ingots you can get each day is limited atm, so Im thinking they'll keep making profit for now.
---
Its a decent reward just not as flashy as the shoulderpads or chair, I suppose
---
You should attend to Dragon's Stand meta, there is always at least one organized map, tons of XP there.
---
Decent is also repeating story if you have multiple lvl 80.
---
Other methods are adventures, but it's daily. Ofc don't forget XP boosters, they give a lot
---
A dumb one but yea. It’s used quite often.
---
Hard disagree on the currency merge. Great way to make sure a ton of past content won't be touched anymore. Imagine all dungeon currencies being merged, would you still think it's a good idea with the impact that would have on dungeons? Now consider that other types of content will also have a similar impact.
---
I mean you apt 90 gold for 12 slots more compared to a 20
---
They crafting cost do not grant you 32 slot more but just 12.
---
The WP mesmer build is actually excellent for what it's meant for.... open world pve... you stack quickness and 25 might on yourself instantly and have a million clones up.
---
Calling it trash is true for raids, but that's not what its meant for so why say it?
---
Literally nothing but Anet bad.
---
Maybe he is pregnant - you know - weird tastes:-D

It's a gating mechanism on at least one of the adventures

Only time I tried to use one was in that pit filled with the big headed dinosaurs in the north of Auric Basin. Exalted Armor, I choose you! Exalted Armor uses Rest!

Ah okay

Yeah, so the fuck what? I posted here exclusively for 5 years because other subreddits didn't interest me and I didn't have the time. Some people make accounts exclusively for particular channels. It's not a sin.

You have no clue what magnite shards are do you.

---
Have you seen Lord Taeres Shadow?
---
Nah, I'm a crpg player but I almost never play them more than once. ln my opinion replay takes something away from the experience.
---
To put it simple: WvW and PvP is killed simply by the horrible design and balance decisions. Competitive gamemodes live and bloom trough a proper and good balance. Every class has been powercrept into extremes, its the worst state of balance i have ever seen in any game. For PvP they just need proper balance and a couple of new gamemodes like a proper 5v5 deathmatch.
---
For WvW they also just need a good balance and a rebalance of the current system. Nobody likes uneven and unbalanced blob fights.
---
In PvE they made the mistake to not go for xpacs. They just dont add new stuff thats worthwile. Nobody cares about a new map and meaningless masteries, instead focus on a new elite spec. Or better and meaningfull character progression and customization. The current trait systems arent enough. If you add exciting new ways to build your characters player will replay old content to test things as well as benefit PvP and WvW.
---
To start, you might want to find out how well you do in a sterile situation.  In the Lion's Arch Aerodrome raid lobby south of Lion's Arch, there's a Special Forces Training Area where you can summon a golem and apply boons to yourself/conditions to it, letting you test your DPS.  Run through your rotation on that.  Focus on your boon-giving rotation even though you don't need to give boons there (or alternately, don't give yourself any boons via the console and rely on yourself, though that'll bring your numbers much lower than the benchmarks you'll find on websites), and see how well you do.
---
In actual fighting, you won't do nearly as well, and that's okay.  You'll have some things you need to dodge, you might be CCed occasionally, enemies won't hold still, etc.  But still, knowing the baseline will be helpful, and practicing your rotation in a stress-free environment can help once you're thrown into the fire.
---
It's hard to use strikes to improve or gauge your performance well.
---
 You usually will not have a good composition, but they're also easy enough not to fail whatever you do. Normally, if you fail with a proper composition you can easily see who is doing bad using the DPS meter and logs like how many time somebody goes down. In strikes it's much more of a grey area. Since the mechanics are all not really threatening, you should be doing somewhat around benchmark DPS considering the bosses are not much more than a DPS golem. But with the compositions in strikes, you can't guarantee that you have all the buffs or support to actually hit those numbers. I agree that an ingame way to check gear or DPS would go a long way towards helping people improve, but unfortunately ANet won't do that.
---
As boon chrono, the best thing you can do is look at your boon uptime. You can export the logs from your arcDPS towards external sites like https://dps.report/ and https://www.gw2raidar.com/info-help. Unfortunately, they don't really have much support for the strikes yet since they're more focused on helping people to perform on raids.
---
Logs are the best way to analyze your own performance by far though.
---
I started writing a bullet list of oneliners attempting to answer your overarching question.
---
I had 29 lines when I decided not to post it because it would just have come off as a lengthy negative rant.
---
It would have answered your question by listing alot of separate reasons however. Most of them not adressed in the comments so far, at least not directly or in detail.
---

---
There's a storyteller nearby the keep, who can tell you a bit about his hunger... And about hunger in general.
---
Guild Wars 2 has had negativity around it for slightly over 7 years now.  All the way back to the original "Where's the end-game" complaints, and the "Why is there a new tier of equipment being added" complaints that rose around the same time.
---
In US funding, $400k would give you (for one year):
---
* 8 programmers - $50k per year each
---
* 8 artists - $45k per year each
---
* 3-4 project leads - $100k+ per year each
---
You're going to need at a minimum 1 project lead, 1 programmer, and 1 artist.  That means you have 2 years of development with that minimum number, and some left over for a contracted sound designer.
---
We're leaving out all the other costs, like renting recording studios, voice actors, the story writers (who could be doing double duty as one of the others), specific artist jobs like animators, texture artists, modelers, riggers...  Assuming you've got a good HR person who hired the right people, you could get away with two artists:  One who is a modeler and texture artist, and one who is a rigger and animator.  Then there's the QA department which definitely consists of more than one guy...
---
In the end, this team probably wouldn't give us anything close to Path of Fire.
---
In reality, you're looking at a dev team like:
---
* 2 project leads (art and programming)
---
* 3+ programmers (likely closer to 6) for new features and back end updates
---
* 4+ artists
---
* * Modeler
---
* * Texture artist
---
* * Rigger/animator (because they do often have a related skill set, and a dedicated rigger might not be necessary)
---
* * Level designer
---
And then contracts for sound design, music, voice acting, and short term costs for a marketing budget.  $400k would cover maybe a few months of development.  The artists will be useful for only part of that development life cycle too, so they'll be cycled in and out of other projects as needed.
---
People have been begging ArenaNet for a long time to communicate more openly. To be more transparent. They've been begging for this for a long time because ArenaNet are historically ***absolutely dogshit*** at actually being accurate when they talk about their features, or when they talk about their *plans* for features, or when they talk about timelines.
---
This game has existed on the mentality, from developers, of "It's ready when it's ready." And for years - many, many years - players accepted this as a token of goodwill. We would have rather had "it's ready when it's ready" than "it's not ready, but we're going to rush it out the front door anyway."
---
But the goodwill bank is not eternal and endless. Promises kept being made, with the "It'll be ready when it's ready" tagline... and those promises kept being broken. It started with PvP and WvW promises. And the worst part was, when those people started to plead for ArenaNet to do something more than their tagline, when they began to say "Hey... things aren't actually that good in these game modes and you haven't made the changes you promised to try keep them updated. What's happening?" they were often shouted down by *the rest of the community*. They were told that they were playing dead gamemodes ArenaNet didn't care about. That if they wanted that kind of gameplay, maybe GW2 wasn't their game.
---
Now those same problems are bleeding over into PvE. Heart of Thorns was not received that well *overall.* It had some good bits, it had some great bits, but it had a lot of bad bits. But at least ArenaNet had tried something new with it. Path of Fire was received similarly... but it never felt as good as Heart of Thorns did. That didn't make it bad, though! *It* had some great bits too! They were still trying new things! They were still ***trying*** at all. More goodwill was paid out the goodwill bank because while neither expansion was a surefire hit, they weren't excessively terrible or lacking in quality. But the Living World seasons, by comparison, *did* decline in quality somewhat. The writing got generally worse. Good characters that *really* helped pull the narrative and keep it engaging were killed (Joko) and replaced with far lesser characters that we really didn't care about (Kralkatorrik - who felt like a less existential threat than Joko did at all times.) Many elite specs have been nerfed in pretty terrible ways, despite players regularly offering good and constructive feedback as to why the changes were bad and what ArenaNet might be able to do to fix the changes while keeping the spec balanced in line with others.
---
And now we don't have an expansion *at all*. ArenaNet have been publicly bleeding staff this year - which isn't really anything new in the *industry* but it isn't often such a visible affair. NCSoft had to come in and force a huge shake up to - as far as *we* were aware - get the company re-focused on Guild Wars 2 instead of secret side projects. Yet there is very little to show for that shake up, either. Fractals and raids are going the way of dungeons, despite one of those two things being made to replace dungeons to begin with. The narrative is *not* improving and yet now it's the last bastion of this game, or I guess it's supposed to be somehow. The "Prologue" episode felt more feature complete than "Episode One" did, which isn't a particularly good endorsement of their "expansion-level content" season. The original announcement for the Icebrood Saga spent more time pushing merchandise than it did talking about the game, and now it turns out a lot of those things they talked about and hyped up simply don't live up to the claims that they made.
---
ArenaNet have been historically untrustworthy, but they had a *lot* of goodwill. They never seemed *malicious*. It never felt like they were taking us for a ride, and it always felt like they were genuinely trying. With every expansion, it felt like they at least *gave a shit* about the content, and tried their best even if some features or aspects weren't necessarily all that great. Now, though? Now it feels like the company's just got a skeleton crew of interns working on this game. It feels like updates are pushed out the door regardless of their content or quality so that they can keep on releasing their gemstore updates. The game feels *actively* neglected by the company. It doesn't feel like there's a genuine love or care for the game any more, or for trying to keep promises they make at all. It just feels like it's another hollow corporate product wanting to wring wallets dry under the guise of "BUT FREE CONTENT UPDATES. FREE TO PLAY. NO SUB FEE. LOOK HOW *FREE* THIS ALL IS!" And anybody who tries to constructively criticise the game in a desperate last hope that *maybe* somebody at ArenaNet will take notice (we know they won't, we *know*, but what else can we do for a game we genuinely love outside of abandon it to this sad, miserable little fate it's writing for itself?) often these days get sighed at and huffed at, "Why can't you just be quiet?" "Why do you have to be so *negative*?" "Why don't you go play a different game?" and it fucking sucks.
---
Sounds like this was inspired by the wendigo
---
Also, for this kind of work, the programmers probably wouldn't be $50k tier.
---
Keep in mind we're mostly talking about OP's crazy idea of a total engine upgrade, but not the sort that requires new art assets.
---
I'll have you know I used only the finest squid guts in my armor infusion
---
No skyscale was ever out of reach of a springer jump and you were never required to wall jump with the skyscale either. So even if you had to kill stuff, a skyscale was always within reach.
---
The skyscale is basically a glorified everything. You didn't ever need it. It's a convenient mount just like the griffon.
---
the in and outs are probably laying traps or something like that, pre-setting the strike with hundreds ready for the boss to spawn on top of them. i've seen vids of people doing this for fractals and raids.
---
as for the graphics glitch, try your settings, play around with them, or try starting the game with the -repair setting.
---
Oh that golem sounds perfect for practicing. Anet might want to advertise stuff like that more inside the game. I'll go practive there.
---
Okay that makes sense. And thanks for pointing out that arc can provide that boon uptime info. I'll have a look at that!
---
The problem is that your performance in strike depends of the group (i.e. boons, specific advantage) so you can't really improve your self performance. Otherwise you can improve your knowledge of who can give which boons, composition knowledge, etc. All that will improve the group performance.  
---
And you can maybe find a guild/players which will point out how you can improve.  
---
You can learn how to read reports too but in strike it's not really helpful.
---
&gt; If you note, all under the Heart of Thorns masteries are green
---
[Are you sure about that?](https://i.imgur.com/XZwsAau.jpg)
---
and yours is literally nothing but Anet great.
---
Freeze mechanics? You mean "press 1 a few times every 3 minute mechanics"? I am not even sure you can die from freezing atm.
---
Hmm yeah I might experiment going with or without reflects. I guess it also depends on what the team is doing. If they run all over the place then most of the arrows won't be reflected anyway.
---
Let's just say there are "less demanding" metas for the same reward.
---
I mentioned this in another thread. Giving out currency for something like ascended armor would devalue raids. They can’t add valuable rewards to strike missions because it is casually farmable and anything worth value would be worthless overnight.
---
I didn't even remember that one existed lmao.
---
Currency for ascended isn't necessary. They could also just give currency to buy one or 2 unique account bound skins after 3 weeks of clearing it on reset. Like the dagger skins the Fraenir uses and are not already anywhere else in the game. You get an incentive for people to do the strikes more than once that can't be devalued since they don't have value beyond being a skin.
---
You misunderstand. He doesn't exclusively post here, but all his submission here are exclusively negative.
---
Overwhelmingly, not exclusively. There is very little need to start a critical submission, so I usually just post in the ones already existing.
---
They don't ask for shards. They ask for LI or KP. If the material can't be pinged fine by me. But I doubt the Strikes are going to reach that level
---
My computer is pretty decent and I struggle with performance with GW2 unlike any other game
---
Could've been different if they paid some mildly popular streamers/youtubers instead of going with leggings, quiznos and tidal.
---
That one is actually useful. Not being slowed is extremely useful any time you fight the Chak.
---
In Open PvE and things like Strike, you'll rarely see people go past 16-17k DPS without perfect boons (alacrity, quickness, 25might, fury). If you're around that DPS (IMO over 10k), then you're good. 
---
Your DPS is fine for a support build. I see plenty of DPSer builds/professions doing 6-8k DPS.
---
I hate using runes of thief in raids, I just stick to scholar. Some bosses are frustrating to stay in the flank or the back.
---
Di maka transfer pre. Full eh 😭
---
The more casual players don't know these summons exist unless ANet throws them in their inventory with achievements
---
No offence to Carbine Studios and Wildstar they were an unknown quantity hence NCSoft would have found it easier to close them down. Now you look at Anet its harder. 1. Like others in thread have said GW2 like GW1 is NCSofts biggest game in the West. 2. Anet have been with NCSoft for 20 years next year they had one of the founders go to NCSoft West years ago. Finally 3. Anet are still making NCSoft a lot of money Wildstar was horrible outside its raids. I don't see GW2 or Anet being closed down now if the layoffs hadn't happened I think eventually GW2 would have been shut down but money is more important than new games.
---
What about the "I gotta save this for an emergency/special occasion" pitfalls?
---
There is no patch on Tuesday it will be at 4:30pm on Monday Anet time.
---
The issue is that I only have an ascended armor, I have used always strength runes with strength sigil in weapons, and I'm thinking if should change to scholar or not for get more dps (and as you say maybe also to change strength sigil for impact).
---
With scholar runes if my health drop from 19.212 to 17.290 I lost the 5% damage that with the strength runes I have all time with might (25 stacks easily), but with Scolar I have +225 ferocity all time and maybe that'll compensate although some of might stacks will lost I guess if also change the sigil of strengh, and I don't know then what of the 2 options will do more dps in general.
---
About time of fights, most of them are very shorts with trash mobs except bosses.
---
About thief runes, I don't like damage condicion for dps warrior, even though the last bonus is fine.
---
My playtime approximate is:
---
85% PVE open world (30% solo 70% events with people)
---
10% Dungeons/Fractals
---
5% WvW, Raids, PvP
---
What bosses?
---
I can't look at this without thinking of the often used incel analogy. The one about vaginas.
---
not even as a joke bro
---
I had a look at those, which seem to be 3rd generation (?):
---
[AMD Ryzen 3 3200G](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-7400-vs-AMD-Ryzen-3-3200G/3886vsm824486) \~100€!  
---
[AMD Ryzen 5 3400G](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-7400-vs-AMD-Ryzen-5-3400G/3886vsm825156) \~150€ still okay  
---
[AMD Ryzen 5 3600](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-7400-vs-AMD-Ryzen-5-3600/3886vs4040)
---
Can you say anything to those? Also, given that I use the DirectX 12 bridge, does single-core performance matter that much?
---
&gt; MMOs are freaking expensive to make.
---
Not more than any other AA+ game. The cost lies on the side of the maintenance, but that's what microtransactions and subscriptions are for.
---
What types of bosses should I look into practicing solo in?
---
The best way to look at Scholar runes is to think of the 6th bonus as being +5% damage for the first few seconds of the fight / first burst.
---
If you keep it longer that's great, but if you go into a fight with that expectation you're going to make better decisions.
---
Full disclosure, my warrior uses strength runes.
---
I would use Scholar at all bosses even ones that are mostly easy to flank, take that for whatever its worth.
---
anything after 2014 that runs with dx912pxy should be fine.
---
What is the raven summon for one eternal ice used for
---
Is there a time that they do this? I've been trying to get Smash the Dragon for what seems like ages now.
---
hol up, you can get the home instance node in the strike mission chest? why can you spend more to get it from the vendor? can i have the difference refunded?
---
if you'd just inform yourself a little you might find out that he's not useless at all lol. the way presidency works in germany is in my opinion far superior to presidency in countries like the US
---
Hot masteries are certainly something. There are alot of them and you need millions of XP.
---
AB and DS Metas, LS3 Maps and Adventures probably are the easiest XP.
---
Especially at AB being at the octovine fight is enough for like 400k XP
---
Karma died when people stacked karma buffs to max years ago and then used all of their karma flasks to get millions and millions of karma before they nerfed that. You now have old players with way too much and new ones with almost no karma. The currency had to die once the nerf came otherwise it would be insanely unfair for new players.
---
That's the difference between currencies and materials. 
---
Currencies go straight to your wallet, they can't be pinged... Like Volatile Magic or Magnetite Shards.
---
Materials fill up your bank storage and then stay in inventory... Like LI
---
The person whos comment we're responding to specificed currency, not material. So the pinging argument is meaningless.
---
This was over once you went all "I was just trolling"
---
Tell ya what. You keep replying with new things. If something perks my interest I'll respond.
---
Thanks
---
Ah. Fair enough
---
I still use the WW and Chimeric Prism.
---
who?
---
Well this is half the map so ...
---
Mounts are not the issue. The map is small and unimpressive.
---
Eh, I find it very niche
---
Let's have a look from the corporation's perspective. Why invest into something that's already a cash cow? GW2 is already bringing in millions... MILLIONS from a 7 year old game and they are happy with that. And why shouldn't they be?
---
They only need to put out just enough content to satisfy the lowest common denominator of the playerbase. This subreddit and I would argue even the forums are not the type of players ANET cators to. All ANET has to do is: keep the outlook here and forums fairly positive and this alone will get casual players to log back around releases and get new players into the game. Also throw in some giveaways with other weirdo failing businesses (maybe ANET got paid by them??) and random 50% off PoF sales. 
---
More new players = more opportunities to go whaling. 
---
ANET banks on players who only play the game a bit, that way they have to spend real world $$ to get anything shiny. ANET also needs a small number of vets as billboard ads to display their new line of gem store drops every week. 
---
So where in this business model, do any of those things you mentioned factor in? What you said is true, yes, but why improve something that's already working? Why should ANET take that risk? ANET lacks other games to fall back on; so then why ruin the only asset they have? They can't exactly re-release GW1 as a classic...
---
I play Sword/Shield Holosmith in open world these days, and I'm wondering how I can get more CC for breakbar usage? For whatever reason stuff that used to just destroy breakbars doesn't seem to cut it anymore. Current utilities are Heal Turret, Spectrum Shield, Hard Light Arena, Laser Disk, and Prime Light Beam. I know that's not a lot of CC right now, but... idk. It felt like at the start of PoF that PLB + Prismatic Singularity + Holographic Shockwave + the two Shield skills was enough to do the CC needed, but now it feels like these skills barely do a damn thing to breakbars. 
---
I tried swapping in Bomb Kit, but things in open world these days move around WAY too much to reliably hit with Big Ol Bomb. Possibly Grenade Kit, Elite Mortar, and Personal Battering Ram instead?
---
&gt; (Spoiler: it will).
---
I get about a 25% FPS loss using the plugin on a computer that can run games like the Witcher 3 and Skyrim with stupid graphics mods quite happily. It's not as reliable as some people say. 
---
I do agree on the "just install it and see"  part, though. Worst case scenario is you install it again.
---
Idk, maybe good balance patch or some changes for wvw and/or pvp?
---
I would like the concept fingertips and orb plz
---
That was really fun to watch. A little too short (/s), but amazo”ing anyway!
---
I think it’s really to force people to learn that they can interact with those little raven statues in general, as it’s a mechanic that’s used both for the locks and for other interactions (in the maze, for example).
---
That's a pretty crappy use of a mastery slot though, is it not? The expansion masteries already serve the same purpose.
---
I believe you can, and the freeze can hit you when your health is already very low.
---
&gt; This is still likely the best RvR game, almost uncontested and after seven fucking years of seeing barely any non-damaging updates.
---
amen
---
It's not only spvp thing. Open world is full of bots as well. Without them game would feel very empty so probably that's the reason why arena net don't ban them. https://i.imgur.com/X9ud5yR.png
---
lmao this subs hate for casual players is amazing
---
you dont need might tho,you shoud play berz and  1 shot every mob or kill any vet in 5. thief runes are used for that 10% dmg,not for condi stats and its for meta comp,not when you are solo. just play this,http://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Berserker_-_Power_Bannerslave and remove banners,swap double standarts and BOOM best open world build and use scholars,its probably best choice.
---
Once the whole game is dead I believe people won't haunt you with "bitching" anymore. Now shh, calm down. It's ok. Soon everything will be allright. :)
---
&gt; Public mode exists
---
It only exists for newest Strike. After that it gets removed. There is no public option for first strike (Icebrood Construct) anymore.
---
*What is dead may never die!*
---
Don't use "we" when showing your very own personal opinion. Just like you should not use "this subbreddit" when few select users wrote something in some more or less popular post.
---
Deaxon needs more axe so he can axe while he axes.
---
Thread removed: Stirring up drama or violating the CoC is not allowed.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
The Fellblade GS isn't showy, but has a nice subtle black smoke that makes it a nice Reaper blade, IMO.
---
Which is weird because this strike mission is more difficult than the icebrood construct
---
so wait what are the difference between gold and silver? If the mastery chests are always there? Anyone know?
---
You are claiming that mmo genre is dead, but at the same time say that there hasn't been a good mmo released in 5 years? How is that confirmation of anything. I'm sure that AAA mmo would do great in the west.
---
If you do go AMD then the 3600 is a great pick, good value and good single-core performance, should perform better than 1/2nd gen of Ryzen in games even if the 2700x has more cores.
---
Character limit should have the biggest impact for CPU performance.
---
And for 3rd gen Ryzen you'll want good memory as well as it scales pretty nicely, 3000/3200mhz CL15/16 should have good value.
---
That's an Axellent idea, should do that next time
---
That's sexy.
---
With the change of gyros to be wells I wish exalted assistance was similar to that. A PBAoE pulsing buff (probably damage resistance and/or condi cleanse, that feels appropriate for the exalted)
---
Ok Boomer
---
 tl;dr: the game is dead
---
Well you're right, good person :)
---
Except this isn't old content, the map should be designed with mounts in mind because, you know, Anet made the mounts. And yes the map is fucking tiny lol, it's smaller than most core tyria maps made before mounts even existed.
---
Like the other says, boons uptime and what your boons output is really important as a chrono support. Dps is the last thing you wanna improve because your buffs means more increase group Dps output than your own. So the first thing you wanna know is how impactfull was your Boons.
---
The best way to quantify that is with Dps.Report under Buff -&gt; Boons -&gt; Phase active duration -&gt; Generation Squad. If you only use Uptime you didnt see how much YOU contribute but with Generation Squad you see how much %uptime you provide to the squad. This way, you see more your own impact in the squad and can compare yourself easier with an other Chrono.
---
The same can be setup with ArcDps with the Boons table but the visualisation is a bit different.
---
Sorry man, couldn't help myself.
---
I feel you. Imagine going with 10 ppl and 7 of them have the mastery break...
---
After that we all use our own cc tools / skills (at least me and 2 other people have shovels/rods/etc)...
---
We manage the 1st, barely the 2nd and failed the 3rd (i guess we phased too fast and didnt have all cooldowns back). 
---
Meanwhile, theres like 15+ more people around derping at range, plus 10 or so meleeing... 
---
Like seriously, give 1 ap for the strike boner and 10 for the open world one, i can guarantee the strike will not be harder than this ....
---
Heck, many raid bosses were easier than this achievement for me. I had to do it at least 15 times (conservative estimate).
---
This morning i was thinking i would have to get a 10 man squad and take them to buy cc tools, then charge mastery and try again... Good thing i just tagged with a small group of 5 randos... And we almost fail it because by the 3rd bar there were like 15 people.
---
Btw the "more = bad" is widely known for the harder open world events like some sandswept bosses.
---
3700x will destroy the 9600k on almost everything, but with a heavy OC the i5 will likely pull more frames on a few games that don't use more than 6 cores.
---
Thank you so much! The price difference between 3400G and 3600 is around 60€. Do you think it is worth it?
---
I'm thinking about [this mainboard](https://www.gigabyte.com/de/Motherboard/GA-AB350M-DS3H-rev-1x#kf), seems to be fairly priced and provides the exact same connections as my current mobo does, so I won't have issues with the cabling.
---
As memory, I would pick some random 3200Mhz DDR4 sticks from amazon.
---
You can't compare...
---
PvE bots don't hurt anyone's enjoyment of the game. Unless you are the "Karen type", who is so self-righteous and easy to trigger that you have to stay there for 10 minutes scolding them and telling them how wrong what they do is, while you report all of them.
---
PvP bots are a real problem, ruining a game mode.
---
&gt;Red/~~Bull~~/Fallen Blue/~~Raven~~/Svanir
---
Ox and Eagle respectively, not Bull/Raven. Raven is the friendly spirit who survived, while Ox/Bear/Eagle are all defeated spirits from when the Norn fled south.
---
You got it all correct otherwise though :)
---
Special currency that allows for the _purchase_ of the RNG rewards would be lovely.
---
man, i was looking for one of these a couple hours ago :D Than i just went and did map competitions on all of my characters by using pretty much the same path
---
Exactly, like raids have.
---
Do you know if completing Bjora Marches gives you a key?
---
He is! I've seen him a few times right before the meta and today I had the chance to get to him in time and he called the attack right when the meta started.
---
Strikes generally aren't the best place to gauge your performance/improvement after the 1st time because you basically cannot fail them. 
---
If you are genuinely interested in improving then the best place would be to push into T3/T4 fractals and raids (either through a guild or raid discord). 
---
You can also do your own solo testing through the test golem which you can find in the aerodrome which allows you to apply Boone to yourself.
---
How do I ditch Brahm?  I'm loading into the new map with him and he keeps pointing stuff out and whining about things.  I want to get lost in the atmospheric terror forest, not babysit an NPC.
---
It's the same old as every episode before (or less becaues the other half will be episode 2) after getting told we will get expansion level features. Strike Missions are new but we all know Anet will screw it up because even after getting bombarded with the wish for difficulty settings they still haven't managed to provide them and we didn't hear anything about Anet going for it. 
---
We get half an episode with no raids and fractals claimed to be not in the next episodes after Anet "focused full forces on GW2" after the layoffs. If a movie game is all they can produce then gg.
---
Roleplaying.
---
I've got one 4 out of 7 times :)
---
There are getting to be so many maps from LW seasons 3, 4, and 5 that it's hard to keep track of what each one offers.
---
Is there a table somewhere summarizing each living world season map listing the currencies, magic, ascended items, home nodes, armor/weapons, and other things?
---
This is why I have several summoning items sitting in my bank. Where I'll never accidentally waste them.
---
I may have a problem.
---
Won't he go away once you advance the story?
---
aaah, so this is his bitch account because he's too much of a coward to attach this to his real one
---
It does help. Future newer players will get into it for rewards. What there is now is dead on arrival.
---
Yes? I've both skins unlocked. 
---
What's the question here? I just don't like it and prefer the simple fellblade.
---
The whole boneskinner is 100% inspired from the Wendigo. Majority of depiction of it looks like this skinny/starved/rotten werewolf body with  exposed ribcage and deer skull plus antlers. Sounds familiar right? And it's a legendary beast from the woods.
---
Everything about the boneskinner and that quest is based on the Algonquian myth of the Wendigo :P
---
(I always found this myth to be fascinating)
---
Sure, the log for the kill bugged out somehow, it's shown as failure at 0.18% and time is off. 
---
[Kill](https://dps.report/4Qu0-20191124-003906_arriv), [earlier attempt](https://dps.report/6smt-20191123-203426_arriv).
---
Man I like pvp and wvw, but seeing how Anet treats it, I often think they should just shutdown those gamemodes once and for all.
---
Oh where did we get confirmation there's more Boneskinner stuff coming? Can you link me please, I would love to read/watch it.
---
both sites have gear optimizers you could use. Copying a build is not always best because a lot of builds are equal or in 1% range of eachother. For example snowcrows doesnt show a scholar set for slb or warr because those sets need assassins and have 50+ equally strong builds. It depends on preference like having access to legendaries or spare assassin pieces since there is no strongest build.
---
Oh, last quest in War in Kryta?
---
I should pop back into GW1, I don't remember that.
---
F pressing is content right?
---
It exists as a storytelling mechanism to demonstrate your bond with Raven beginning.
---
Just as much as Autoattacking is exciting combat. Arenanet is master of immersion.
---
DeAX(e)on is a pleb
---
Saying bots only because they farm meta? Lol
---
Ideally at the end of a strike a window like the pvp end match should appear, indicating deal damaged, heals provided, boons uptime, times downed, etc.
---
From what I can tell from experimenting with it, each orb ads 30 seconds (thus the 30 orbs = 15 min charge).
---
PVP was never alive. There were never hundreds of pvp guilds or other signs of live.
---
Exactly...  It’s step one in showing the player, “Hey, there’s gonna be raven stuff everywhere, and you can interact with it, and that’s probably how you’re going to explore these episodes, here’s a simple first step—opening a door.”
---
It’s like how as soon as you get mounts in PoF, you’re immediately confronted with gaps you have to jump across and packs of spiders you have to use raptor round up on. 
---
While obviously pressing F on a statue doesn’t feel as interactive as leaping, it’s the same sort of introductory thing that you learn in game design 101.
---
The problem is not that it’s just a stupid lock mechanic, it’s that there’s not more done with it later...  Like, why not have a jumping puzzle built around activating certain statues in a set amount of time to open doors, why not have to use raven locks to trap and defeat a boss, etc, something...  
---
The fact that it never goes beyond opening a door or activating a passive shield effect is the problem, not the fact that it opens doors in the first place.
---
2+2=Fish
---
did some research on this and it seems there's a bunch of people(including me) that have the same issue. Nothing seems to work though... different character, achievement only story mode, etc. 
---
There's going to be some kind of fix on the next mini patch i guess/hope.
---
I agree with the spirit of your post. You are right in a bare bones sense of things. However, things are also a bit more complex than that and that goes for what the OP surmise as well. Take a +1 from me and let me expand a bit on it and try to tie some ends together.
---
Yes, core designers and core programmers are the backbone of a game studio. You only have to look at media relations after initial release to see who they were. Some left early, others left late. However, that is also the nature of the business. These core developers are high commodity and hanging on to them is difficult. Especially in times when alot of capital hit the market. At the same time, it is up to management to manage rehiring and even if you may not get ahold of the same level of talent it is important to recruit to maintain the vision and qualities of people who leave. Ownership may make that difficult but dealing with that is part of management.
---
The same sort of part-reality and part managing that reality comes up in most issues that the company seems to struggle with whether that is code legacy, having engineers to work on proprietary engines and limitations of retail engines or to what degree ownership dictates vision, direction and prioritization either directly (stepping over management) or indirectly (through resources and demand). Similarily, some issues can be worked around but Anet seems to have made poor decisions there as well in the balance between what the owners asks for, resources made available, maintaining their own vision and getting influenced by the resources that are hired and available.
---
So,
---
Things like DX12 and multithreading is likely more a question of turnover and ownership than anything else, they have probably lost more engineers than they have been allowed to rehire to work on the legacy and it may be things related to the physics engine as well. Those are resources issues more so than true legacy issues.
---
Things like not being able to change the ingame physics, for example in the GH arena, or issues with the modularity of the programs on the other hand is likely legacy issues (documentation etc.) and that is down to management and discipline. There are also work-arounds to restrictions in engines where, for example, that balance systems have been so tied to instanced 10-man content obviously does not help performance at the 100-scale. While 10-man content may have been pushed as a target by ownership, the decision on how to approach that and losing the track or vision of the larger scales lies firmly with management and employees.
---
That they dipped into things like raids, moba (and possibly esports, but far from certain) was most likely an ownership issue or several of the cancelled projects they worked on was also likely ownership issues more so than MO going off the rails. He's taking the brunt of the blame for that but I think a good portion of that is unfair. If you read into what has been said one would assume that MO&amp;Co wanted to do GW3 and NCsoft wanted to expand the IP into other genres and platforms.
---
Let's not forget: NCsoft does not just publish GW2, they own ArenaNet. MO, Strain and Wyatt sold ArenaNet to them and NCsoft in turn have stockholders. When there is success stockholders expect more success. They rarely keep focus on reinvestment or long-term vision. The publisher and developer have to fight to keep that vision and the developer lost that vision when they went from starting trends to following trends.
---
That they believe themselves to be very good at storytelling or that they churn out creative assets (a bottleneck) far quicker than gameplay assets (lower intensity in post-development) is likely a result of having too many employees in creative roles relative gameplay roles. They want to work on what they were hired for and they have lower turnover than gameplay developers so they are harder to get rid of. So in part they may believe in their current direction but in part they may also have doubled down on it because they have created an echo chamber internally or may not be able to fire and rehire to balance roles out. Finding work as a content writer is obviously more difficult than as a noted systems designer. Also, if NCsoft says no to hiring engineers (and programmers or designers) it is also difficult to turn development around to those areas. It is a workforce equipped to do "sagas" as much as they believe that sagas appeals the best to the playerbase.
---
Yet, to conclude: Alot of the problems that the game faces are not necessarily things that require massive changes in the workforce and can be solved by changing attitudes, corporate culture and directing decisions. Some problems do require getting NCsoft onboard or causing turnover by putting pressure on inhouse culture and attitudes.
---
I think it's there just for flavor.
---
In that case I wouldn't care at all about your DPS until you are confident and capable at upkeeping 100% quickness and alacrity for your group. That's your main job as boon Chrono. Once you've got that rotation down and learned and are capable at fulfilling your role then you should worry about minmaxing your DPS.
---
Wait a minute, this isn't the destiny subreddit
---
You should also travel the map without running. Of course of you use your sprint's insane travel speed and overpowered dodging abilities to get through terrain and mobs, that the map will feel small and unsatisfying.
---
Moreover, sprinting for so long in the snow and the blizzard is totally unrealistic.
---
/s
---
Despite what you're claiming, most people aren't saying that the map is "small" in the absolute, they're saying that:
---
1. The map is quantitatively smaller than what they used to produce (it seems to be often compared to the prologue map).
---
2. There is less content in the map and the story is short (which has nothing to do with mounts).
---
The major problem GW2 has from a raid design perspective is the dodge roll, and invulnerability frames in general. It's great for small scale, 1v1 or 2v2 combat, but makes it a lot more difficult to get the kind of role differentiation that necessitates teamwork.
---
I think there is also the light puzzles where you activate th statue to trigger a light pulse
---
That's just your toxic elitist opinion, duh! Only the right opinions are facts! Can't you see?
---
This is why I run necro a lot in open world the self buffing gets insane value and means I can almost do raid level dps with little to no support.
---
Google the 'ok boomer' meme
---
Because ArenaNet is mostly comprised of talented artists and awful managers.
---
Can confirm it is this (at least for me). I usually run with character model limit on low, keep having to bump it to high on this strike to be safe.
---
Clearly the lesson has not been passed on from the raid team :( .
---
What really helped me getting into it was to practice 1v1s vs. various builds for hours in costum lobbies. 
---
You need to break it down step by step. Learn your class and learn what other builds are capable of before you even jump into a game.
---
Power Reaper is insane. The Quickness and Stability help a lot to land hits. Then, over that, you have Fury, Might, high power/crit damage and many multipliers. 
---
Most of time, in Open PvE and Strikes, Guardians (DH, FB), Berserkers and Reapers do high damage easily. Followed by well played Eles (Tempest, Weaver) and Holos. I'm always surprised by the weak damage from SBeasts.
---
I barely use my skimmer, but I would buy that as a mount skin in a heartbeat
---
In a proper metroidvania this would be a core mechanic that no one would complain about, akin to using missiles to open doors. 
---
But I guess in GW2 every single pickup needs to be something akin to a morphball or a wave beam and a pox on the devs if they don't do that every time.
---
Wait, if the Koran was eating Aberrant warg meat, they’re apparently not specters and have some sort of flesh to consume, right?
---
Should be quite decent. Not best, but you should be running smooth for most situations. Then again, ifs mac and Im not sure how the game is optimized for those, your best bet is simply downloading the game and seeing for yourself. But i can guarantee itll be smooth at the very least.
---
GW2 never got much new content. As comparision: nightfall got released half a year after factions. A year after nightfall Anet released EoTN. EoTN had 18 dungeons, dunno how many "world" maps. 20? 30? Just to show the difference...
---
We got a 4 and a 5 (?) map expansion. People begged for an expansion pre-HoT because there was so little content. They hoped for a big expansion - and were let down. If both expansions would've been 20 open world maps, 10 new dungeons expansions we would not have such debates. 
---
People complained massivly short after expansions (like 2-3 months later) about a "content drought"...and this weren't just extreme hardcoreplayers which rushed through the content with playing 24/7.
---
Content lacking is nothing new, it's a problem since release. Coregame offered plenty of content which lasted till 2013-2014 and since then only small pieces got released, no "big hit", no "expansion like" content. Just "DLCs".
---
I would pay 1000 [Festival Currency X] to feed Droobert to that Kodan
---
&gt; The expansion masteries already serve the same purpose.
---
I mean, Icebrood Saga is delivering "expansion-level features", so...
---
You get the achievement upon picking up the Raven Lens in the story, but if you used a teleport to friend to initially enter the map, and you discovered the map's little fort town before doing the story, you don't get credit. I'd expect a fix eventually.
---
I would just try it.
---
Personally I get a fps boost, but my client crashes too many times with it so I just had to uninstall it :/
---
You should create a zip of your original GuildWars2 Folder before installing dx912 just in case.
---
I think the same thing whenever I consider jumping back in, and I never do for this reason. So far I’ve gotten no satisfying answer either, just fanboys blindly defending their favorite company.
---
That's true if you don't have a lot of characters or different builds you swap between. In my case I know this will allow me to have more diversity between my end game PvE builds and my open world builds, picking for example some Assassin amulets for extra crit chance instead of Berserker.
---
In addition their price is so low you get enough to buy one just by farming the home instance node daily for one month, or by farming the map for something like one hour if the meta is up. That's a lot of extra amulets in the long run!
---
Do meta.  Can’t open all the chests even though I have tier 2 for every mastery, because I didn’t tag enough trash mobs during the meta to get a full charge.  Okay.
---
Did the icebrood construct strike every day for the shoulders, bought them off the AH last monday
---
Am I... missing something? You're referring to GW3 like that's something they've announced and are for-sure doing as opposed to them spending more time on GW2.
---
I honestly don't know if you're being sarcastic or not or if you somehow thought that I was being a jerk with my original answer to OP.
---
What ever you believe, what I said isn't opinion. It's hard fact. Bjora Marches in it's current state is a small map and that has nothing to do with mounts, like OP claims.
---
&gt; should have a unique currency with unique rewards
---
This type of system needs to be applied to everything that is done daily. I'm still surprised world bosses don't have their own unique currency. A currency system ensures that replayability will always happen. Another plus is its really easy to add new items if you choose to do so. 
---
I still think the ultra rare infusions should be earnable with this type of system. You could buy a account bound version after grinding for X amount of time. RNG has its place in every game but its so damn nice when you have a way to 100% earn something, even if it takes awhile.
---
Usually LW masteries are tasteless and useless outside their respective maps. This one tho...
---
personally i'd recommend some of the dungeon ones..cof p1 is super easy to solo on chrono and could be a good starting point(look on youtube how to skip the part that requires 4-5 people)
---
they have actual mechanics and telegraphs and stuff to avoid but also die pretty fast due to the powercreep
---
No.. This is similar to.. I don't know, I can't think of any powerups in metroid that are *never* used again.
---
Here, as with the ls2 masteries, they're used in their respective maps and never again. Why, just now we started to get bouncing mushrooms and leylinesand updrafts again because we cried about it for so long.
---
No. It's confirmed. I took it from official forums.
---
I'm not saying they don't affect the game, but it's much less harmful than bots who directly make gameplay worse.
---
It's just not comparable.
---
Sounds like you just dont like WP. Which is fine, that's your opinion, but the build is objectively really good at open world content. If you cant find the synergies of everything used in it, that's on you.
---
Truffle farm, a pinnacle of gw2 endgame.
---
The problem I think is that most people don't realize that the more people interact with the pylon at the same time the more powerful the Exalted becomes. Not saying that it would make a difference with AI, but it might. Just never actually got more then 1 person to use it at a time...
---
If referring to frosty border/clutter. This is an intentional design by anet.
---
Hero.
---
Wow i did not know mcdonald’s pays $35 per hours a week! Unless I misinterpreted it due to bad grammar. I should look into getting a a job at mcdonald’s!
---
Doesn't that also give you the ability to remove stacks of goop. Honestly one of the best skills IMO, but I can see how if you play a character that has tons of range, leaps, or ports it could lose a bit of effectiveness.
---
so silver is 2 greens and 2 blues and 2000 karma, and gold is 1 yellow, 3 greens, 3 blues 4000 karma? wow..
---
That idea deserves being discussed :)
---
But I'll keep the list as it is for now. The main reason why achievements have reverse order is because otherwise you scroll all the time while playing lastest content. Same problem is happening now with current LFG. But with my suggestion, the open world lfg is reduced to 4 subcategories, all immediately accessible, so I prefer to keep them in story chronological order.
---
it lasts for  40 sec and you whoud have to go there 3x after boss spawns....,doesnt seems like interesting/fun thing to do,also take a buff so you can see something game? whats next? mobs gona throw flashbangs? and your whole screen will go pure white?
---
i have nothing against him except the fact he promotes retarded builds
---
there are no synergies to find unless you're imagining things..the standard raid (illusions version) power chrono with 1 trait changed(improved alacrity over danger time) is one of the best open world builds mesmer has! it has like 70% quickness uptime, loads of might and fury and everything else
---
the build WP recommends is objectively trash, he has alacrity well and illusionary reversion lmao
---
but i digress..it's a pointless argument anyway, keep playing his garbage builds that accomplish nothing
---
As a PvP player you should already know this, but matchmaking is always a balance between queue times and match quality. The smaller the population of players the worse this tradeoff becomes. GW2 has a very small pvp population.
---
for over a year the same stupid blabla on teatime. what a shit show.
---
Or just give each of the bosses a unique drop?
---
You're estimate for Bjora Marches getting updated is off by another 4 weeks. We won't expect Episode 2 until January at the very earliest since December is Wintersday.
---
They're objective release schedule is basically every other month for story.
---
I've said for years Silverwates should have been their model going forward, with some refinement, for replayable maps. Its like they luck into a good design then completely fail to recognise it and capitalise on it
---
Because Personal/Living Story instances get them more activity and interest than other game modes, and require less developer commitment. They just script a bunch of NPCs around to say dialogue, and don't have to create any clever level design around it. 
---
People would rather watch a 1h movie rather than play the game.  It's easier and more profitable for developers, so why not?
---
The problem is this playerbase thinks it's an opinion not an objective fact that The Godfather is a better movie than Manos: The Hand of Fate. They feel content with bad movies and don't see any reason movies should be better than that. Just like how this playerbase is content with a "story mission" level design where all it consists of is talking to Rytlock for a few minutes about his son and then fighting 4 enemy Charr for a total of... 5 seconds. 
---
Does this playerbase have any idea how barebones the "story instances" would be with all dialogue removed? Of course they don't. Because to them, they don't see anything wrong with it. They come for the story, not the gameplay.  
---
We have accepted mediocrity, and those with poor taste have won.
---
I mean, they stated that the map would expand in episode 2, not sure what you expect there. And I'm sorry your trowel is broken, must make gardening hard.
---
I use my skyscale all the time. It may not be a "replace all" mounts mount but it's certainly my go-to mount. I just love it lol.
---
Hopefully there's a final expac after Icebrood Saga, but it feels like the last breath of the game before maintenance mode.
---
so a season 6 or an expansion about steve after the saga.
---
Yes, I have a very strong philosophy that you get better at raids, especially at the high end by deleting mechanics and trying to reduce the boss to a golem as much as possible, so I have no interest in adding a mechanic to a boss even if it isnt a very hard one. For a 400 golem dps hit, I'm willing to fight a simpler boss because I strongly suspect in the end my overall dps will be higher because the boss I'm fighting has one less mechanic than someone using Thief runes.
---
The issue with Silverwastes is simple balance and reward structure.
---
The game doesn't make it profitable defend a single base, and it doesn't put any effort to making the sieges feel threatening. Worse, since you're fighting foes with no loot, they don't really feel part of the game.
---
Vinewrath suffers from similar issues where defending escort is unrewarding and boring.
---
Can we please create a new reddit, like "complaingw2" or similar and send these people there?
---
I think this is the best analysis of the current state of Arenanet I've seen on the subreddit (for as far as we can tell anything at all)
---
Playing around shroud skills is the purpose of this spec.
---
Who cares.
---
This is the guy who thinks he's so important that he had his fans hold up events for him to do living story achievements on day one release just because he's a streamer while he was in the middle of doing other events in a different instance/ip.
---
Yes, Desert shroud is scourge's "Shroud" skill and will proc related traits. The damage from your shade skills appears around your *or* if you have a shade active around your shade(s). [Desert shroud](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Desert_Shroud) does 7 pulses around you or your shade and then stops, you'd need to wait the 20 second cooldown to use it again and have enough Life Force to cast it. I'd suggest checking out [builds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Builds) for the game modes you're interested in, anything really works in open world but the other modes and content do want more specific setups.
---
tyria can't exist without all the different dragons,  
---
gw2 community can't exist without diverse content for all players.   
---
...and so far more gamemodes then dragons are getting killed.
---
That's because they communicate a bit *and then stop completely.* Of course people are going to latch on even harder to the small amount of communication they did get. The GW2 community isn't uniquely toxic among gaming communities. There are reasons it reacts more negatively to cancelled promises than other communities, and it's because of how little ArenaNet communicates.
---
They told us that they were focusing all their resources on gw2 moving forward yet somehow we get even less content than before. Being anet, who knows what the hell they are doing if there's anything at all going on.
---
So can anyone explain to me how mesmers put their clones on the walls of opposite team in WvW? Aren't walls meant to be untouchable??
---
It took wildstar 4 years. At what point where they pulling in the kind of money that GW 2 does now? Not a year before they went out of business. A year before they went out of business. there sales were so dismal they didn't have an individual earnings column.  It took Wildstar 4 years but they never really got out of the box. Not ever. This game has been going for 7 years. Comparing the two is at least disingenuous.
---
As another redditor put it:
---
Everything is on the table and nothing is at the horizon.
---
Twitch clips are capped at 1 minute length. The clip itself is the tldr.
---
Most combats don't care about the nitty gritty of the combat system. Most casuals absolutely care of it looks and feels cool though. Some guy in my guild is raving about how it feels to walk around with a hammer and launch stuff. That feels good. All those particle effects that good players complain about, they're lovely for casuals.  
---
My guild isn't dying at all. Shrugs.
---
Plotplottwisttwist: Dwayna is Rytlock???
---
Well people felt the same as you with GW1 and somehow GW2 came to be a bigger game.
---
GW2 has nothing to offer anymore and they pretty much proved it, by well, not delivering on anything. 
---
Also there are numerous examples of work being delayed severely by what you would call spaghetti code. Which means they are limited by games capability on every step, which is also the reason they created GW2, GW1 just couldn't support things they wanted to add.
---
Reasonable speculations about what comes after season 5 means he is butthurt?
---
&gt; Probably because whoever had the core idea left the company before GW2 even released. 
---
Yeah I think this is pretty apparent as well. I see it in WvW which was clearly designed to be a fundamental part of endgame in the initial design only to be left unfinished at launch and then essentially abandoned afterward. I think devs like Eric Flannum and the founder Jeff Strain probably had a huge impact on the base design, but Strain then left and Flannum was hardly heard from after launch. 
---
Ironically spvp had support after launch but focused way too hard on esports and made some really bad decisions in terms of how to develop the mode moving forward.
---
I don't understand why they don't want to introduce the unnecessary subscription model. Look at how ESO has done that! When I played ESO I was fine with it and actually willing to pay it. I want to help ANET and I buy gems sometimes. I buy keys for example even though they are totally unrewarding.
---
I would say, give me endless material storage for 10 eur monthly payment, maybe shove 2 BL keys into the deal and I'm yours.
---
Honestly, they want money but they don't give anything back for the money. Yes, expansions have been worth the moneys, but I already bought them.
---
[important enough i would say.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Deroir)
---
Yeah speculations are just that: speculations. Because hes still butthurt so is his mind and the outcome shows. They cant know.
---
Err... They’ve hold on PoF informations until a few weeks before its launch. If that_shaman hadn’t datamined human  undead faces, PoF hairstyle or if we hadn’t any rumors/leaks, we wouldn’t have known nor suspected anything until the official reveal, so at the last minute.
---
So I don’t think the no talk = no content work.
---
In this case perhaps it’s the truth. The saga reveal was subpar, but it’s still the very beginning. If by July 2020 things are still as underwhelming then yeah we’ll have more legitimate reasons to suspect ‘maintenance mode’, but let’s not forget LS3E1 was equally small.
---
The devs are working from a back foot and honestly they're doing an amazing job. I hope it leads them to good work down the line.
---
What I am still not understanding is what they’re doing behind closed doors.  They have more staff than almost any other MMO and yet consistently put out far less feature-rich content (and content in general).
---
The devs do great work from the art, and scenery side.  The stories often have some high beats, usually out of the gate, but then something just falls flat.  And we get a compelling opening to Ls5 e1, sorry Saga e1 and then just... disappointing development and instances.
---
Are they working on GW3?  New IP?  Side projects outside the gaming sphere?  No one knows what’s going on.  It’s not instilling folks with confidence.
---
I gotta say I really don't care nor like funko pops but these gw2 ones are actually nice. Also Jessica Lewis is adorable, love that as a cinematics artist, she plays raids and that's where she drew her inspiration from.
---
The only weakness of gw2 is arenanet
---
But what is their large pool of staff actually doing then?  They have one of the largest staffs in the MMO sphere.
---
Things have been underwhelming since pof release though, even longer for some modes.
---
&gt; is it crazy to maybe assume they could add a character with new dialogue, or way more ambitious a little new event or two between releases?
---
You're talking about "current events" ?
---
You can make bosses harder by giving them some mechanics, not by blinding players.
---
i was with gw1 + gw2 sometimes more and sometimes less active since its releases.  
---
if i can tell you one thing, then that arena net as a company changed over the years on a massive scale which is normal when you go from a 10 man club to a million dollar company which got sold even before gw1 came out.  
---
...you can be as constructive as you want, you will not change what arena net is. it started with fansites dying out because they got no support...jobs at arena net where the devs / managers left and the holes they left never got closed (see different community managers, economy dev, pvp dev which did tournaments and how long it took to automate the whole process and the state of it now).  
---
simply put: arena net as a company does not care about you. reddit and forums could go radio silent as they are and absolutly nothing would change on the grand scale. they simply do their thing.  
---
you as a player can see that as a bad thing, or as a good thing but it won't change anything.  
---
[or, as gaile gray used to say when there were complains, constructive or not, when she still worked there...](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/526034507791466496/617662231294902283/p9QCNoe.png)  
---
take what you want from it. a few single friendly devs with listen do not make a whole company nor do they change the policy.  
---
there are / were many great devs, like all the different bens. but there is also arena net. look at the history and then think for once.  
---
...in the end the active community itself will be dead. that does not mean all the people stop playing the game. there will always be people playing the game. but making posts on reddit? creating quality youtube content for all kinds of stuff? the active community from wvw, pvp and raids are already on life support. quite a few communitys already left.  
---
...what will be left are the players which do not care about reddit, youtube, twitch, about some communitys, casual or not or anyone. they simply play, maybe chat a bit ig and then log off for the day.
---
"it's not because a large portion of the studio is actually working on future releases, it's because they have nothing to show."
---
Not having anything to show doesn't necessarily mean that no one is working on developments in general imho
---
AMD sucks with games that use shaders. If all you're doing is gaming Nvidia is the way to go. Sure, maybe 1/100 games might give you better fps but 99% of the time Nvidia blows AMD out of the water.
---
I swear if they could go back, they would've made gw2 not a mmo but a story episodic co-op game à la Telltale and I am convinced if a gw3 was to come, that's the format it would be.
---
Probably cause most SB's have weird builds and mostly autoattack on longbow, SB has some really nice burst and decent sustained damage with super easy rotation.
---
It can't self-buff as much as some classes but it can extend its own boons pretty nicely as long as someone is providing them.
---
Well i am done with dialog, we tried for years and well, it only ever got worse.
---
Hope after 7 years, nice trolling
---
I kinda feel that the game is already on maintenance mode. The saga resembles a lot the guild wars 1 chapters situation while gw2 was being developed.
---
January? More like February. It better be amazing as hell, or the game will start hemorrhaging players like crazy.
---
Only used in one recipe, could be replaced by an item, just like [dungeon currencies](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Offering_of_Baelfire) were.
---
I don't think they acknowledge that fact, that all the maps are stuck in time. In fact, that's just a gameplay thing and has nothing to do on the actual story. In lore, all those maps are on the current date. 
---
It just happens that Bjora Marches is actually stuck in a time loop as part of the narrative. It's not like they're going to suddenly realize that Queensdale hasn't had the White Mantle attack yet. Or that Aurene hasn't ascended in Bitterfrost Frontier. You know?
---
why would that be " a pain to work on "?
---
&gt; Contrary to what Anet's communication policy conveys, they actually love showing players stuff.
---
So much so that whenever they show off new content, they typically show us *exactly* what's coming in release.
---
It's why we have a saying on the subreddit "Don't expect anything other than what they've shown"
---
And what they show is usually underwhelming. Which is why people always expect more. Which is why people get disappointed.
---
people tried to have dialogues about and with anet for 7 years in regards to gw2. they are tired of trying. you can only try to have a reasonable argument so many times before frustration takes over 'cause you're effectively talking to a wall.
---
as for your point, you don't have one. you're likely in some form of denial or bargaining phase yourself tbh after what i've seen from you recently. it's not pretty to observe if i'm honest.
---
ofc the devs don't want the game to die, it's their job and livelihood. that however doesn't make the years of tremendous mismanagement and miscommunication (both internal and outwards) go away.
---
they have some great individuals working for them, but as the **company** that is interested in making profit we are little more than cattle to them. only that unlike actual cattle we have the ability and interest to talk back.
---
for the past 7 years gw2 has been a huge hobby of mine, spend more money on it than i care to admit, worked myself towards almost all achievements and skins, i even have a frikkin gw2 related tattoo (it wasn't an impulse, i'm not regretting it, and it's awesome, thank you), i played a lot of gvgs, have 15 or so leggies and all envoy armors, met many people thanks to gw2, and i can identify almost every skin or location based on a shitty screenshot.
---
that all being said i've seen this very situation coming for literally years and i'm not alone in that, because we saw the same signs over and over, and every time it was clear it would be a little more difficult for ANet and their reputation to recover from it.
---
the bad part is that - in the end - i am just some rando asshat on the internet... and yet i somehow still managed to predict all this while ANet's dedicated and paid management kept running head first into it.
---
i'd like to suggest to you - unironically - to take a break from this subreddit, because it seems like taking a step back might help you see things a bit clearer.
---
I tried with different chars and nothing. I discovered the map before I start the story. Ty! Waiting for a fix.
---
Guild Wars 3 confirmed
---
You said “things” have been underwhelming. You should have been specific about these modes.
---
Craft boreal t2 weapons, sell weapons.
---
i havent found the masteries to be useful enough to even try to memorize what they do tbh... i just maxed them out so i can open the chests, and if i get an extra action button to press every now and then then thats cool i guess
---
I don't really see how you can blame "the dodge roll" as the one defining lynchpin that breaks the entire raid design of gw2 apart. Dodges are simply just one of the active defense tools a player has to their disposal, and if there really is a part of a raid fight where they want people to do mechanics without a dodge to help them out they can and will create AoEs or what have you that are undodgable.
---
Technically, all of the F skills are shroud skills by functionality.
---
[Anyone else having this sound bug in the new map?](https://streamable.com/3zk9u) The game's master volume is on zero but I still hear a permanent sound that only stops when I mute the game by using the windows sound mixer. It is propably the raven thing that protects against the cold. This is annoying when tabbing out of the game since the game should be muted while in the background.
---
I'd wager January more likely than February since isn't the Lunar New Year in February? I know that in April we have SAB.
---
I agree with you on Dragon's Stand but everything else you've mentioned exists in quite a lot of MMO's. NPC's having basic behaviour and events being linked together isn't exactly special. I'm not saying it's bad, but it's about par for the course. Other MMO's do it in different ways and most of it isn't voice acted but to me, their worlds feel more alive because it actually feels like a place in the world, a place that threatens you and challenges your wit and power as opposed to a set piece that you're brought through as if it was some attraction at disneyland, and every inch of it feels the same. There is nothing special about recycling the exact same systems over and over, they stopped innovating with open world long ago and it doesn't deserve praise anymore.
---
For me, what is missing is simply challenge. I've never felt threatened at all by the antagonists in any of GW2's stories because I've never been given a reason to be threatened, besides Modremoth. This in turn ruins almost all of the potential immersion I could get from the world. 
---
You know how bad it feels to wait almost a decade to fight the dragon that was described as big as a mountain range, the storm himself who can destroy continents just by existing and then to have him fall over at what I consider a tickle, a mere taster of my skills and training as a hero without even using any boons and let's not even talk about the win button that is dragonsblood spears. It completely ruined the entire buildup and lore around Kralk from a gameplay perspective. All because I've invested myself into the game and gotten an offensive build, the dragon I've been looking forward to fighting for so long was destroyed all because Anet refuse to put difficulty modes in their content. Hearts and Minds Migraine was an exception and I'll praise that every time someone brings it up, I wish they did that more.
---
The same could be said for the "boneskinner" to a lesser extent, they hype up this scary deadly monster that turns out to be completely non threatening (bugs aside, it literally went 100-0 in 10 seconds flat for me, on almost every time I fought it). There shouldn't be an open world version of this thing if they wanted it to actually be something people fear. What GW2 does excellently for me is it's setup, the world and the lore are top notch. But all of that comes undone when literally nothing in the open world is a challenge to anyone who loves the game enough (in a certain way) to become even mildly good at it.
---
GW2 has *always* been *primarily* about the large scale open world PvE, which no other MMO has. This conversation happens every time they stop developing instanced PvE for a while. It's the game's identity, people should not be surprised at this point.
---
Open world players have always been the heart of GW2. Always, not just now. Since the game released in 2012, it's catered almost exclusively to them.
---
If there was no expansion or other major content planned after the Saga, Anet wouldn't keep all those devs on their payroll. It's obvious to me that they are doing *something*. 
---
Sure, it could be Guild Wars 3, or it could be a new IP entirely. But I doubt that, as GW2 keeps showing steady returns quarter after quarter, so I imagine they'll want to keep it from going into maintenance mode for as long as they possibly can. If they announce that any major future content is off the table, those returns are going to take a huge dip and everything else they might be working on is as good as done.
---
So it's in their favor to keep GW2 going with a new expansion and other content. If they end the game, they end the studio.
---
I imagine it's sort of the same effect as how in "War Eternal", When Kralkatorrik &gt;!is smashed hard by the pact he crystalizes and sleeps to repair himself as he feeds on ley line energy!&lt;.
---
I've played at least a dozen MMOs and none of them feel like this one to me. Not one. ESO is the closest, but even that doesn't feel the same.  You can say from today till doomsday that this game is the same, but enough people feel it's different. You don't see/feel the differences. But it's not individual features that make a game it's how those features are combined.
---
Some games have a downed state. Some games have the ability to rez everyone without taking a skill. Some games have dynamic events. Some games have meta events and world bosses. Some games have downleveling. Some games don't let people steal your kills and nodes. Some games give each people their own rewards instead of need greeding stuff. But this is the only game I've played that has all of it. And it all contributes to what the open world on this game is.
---
Sure you can judge the game on individual components and say that this game has that, and that game does this. But at the end of the day it's like saying all the words in this book are the same was all the words in that book. It's how those words are put together that makes a difference. I play this game completely differently than I played WoW or Rift, or TSW, or Lotro, or Aion.  It's just a completely different game, even if you can find different features of it in different games.
---
Exactly this. The first 3 years of GW2 for me was pure bliss. I started during beta weekend. The first 3k hours I logged will forever by my favorite time in GW2. I'm now at 5.5k hours and yes I definitely don't play as much, but I have very fond memories. My guild is still very much active in WvW, so I still have that. I know others who play and their guild has fallen apart. I really wish ANET would do something with WvW. Forget about mounts, let's bring back the WvW tournaments. 
---
In the meantime, I've gone back to GW1.
---
The thing I don't get is... why even do LW model? Why not just... make all this and release at the same time? They're not even making any money with the LW model cause most players unlock the stuff as it's released. Sure, they can get in future players but I'd wager that's a minority.
---
It's called mismanagement
---
This has been evident since the start. One of their biggest mismanagements is how they keep re-inventing the wheel and NEVER go back and fix old content. They just keep adding and adding and adding without worrying about the actual longevity of the game.
---
Looking forward isn't the only way to develop. Sometimes, and often, you have to look back on what you've done and that's something A-Net does not do.
