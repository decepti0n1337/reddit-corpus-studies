The game turned out very differently to what I expected. Which is a bit sad to be frank. But hey I still played a fee thousand hours for no good reason at all.  
---

---
---
---
If you want it you'll enjoy the content to get to it. You basically play the game.
---
I'll start off by saying that I consider GW1 a masterpiece, way ahead of its time and budget, and a game that remains very unique to this day. Also, it was the game I played when I had lots of free time during high school and just by hearing any part of its soundtrack floods me with nostalgia nowadays. 
---
So yeah, when they announced GW2 my expectations were basically impossible to match. And sometimes I still get frustrated thinking about what the game could've been if they followed GW1 more closely. I consumed everything about GW2 since this trailer dropped, pre-ordered, and ended up quitting after a couple of months playing it.
---
Recently I returned though, and while it'll never match GW1 in my eyes, it's still a game that has grown up well over the years and has a lot of content to offer, built on top of decent gameplay mechanics. MMOs are in a low point nowadays, given that every other game has heavy online elements, and to me GW2 is probably the best remaining one at this moment, specially given its business model.
---
I was expecting the same PvP-meta. Huge variety of builds. Not so much in this. 
---
Go for the two summon elemental skills. One is a regular utility and the other is elite. Between the two, you can keep a tanking pet with a clickable skill always up, and two tanks for big fights
---
I would switch them to other skills when in a group, but for solo content they work great. 
---
I thought that bit at the end, where you are limoing along, was cool. 
---
It reminded me of Modern Warfare 2 (I think it was that one), after the Nukes drop and you stagger through the fallout.
---
\*prays\* "A playable mesmer with a rapier. A playable mesmer with a rapier. A playable mesmer with a rapier. A playable mes- OH MY GOD YES LOOK AT THAT HERITAGE LIGHT ARMOR!"
---
Much agreed. I really enjoy nightmare and always hoped that they keep the direction. I can respect observatory and deepstone, but dafq is going on with oasis and sirens? I have absolutely no love and no respect towards trash mob / spam design and sincerely hope they return to elegance of nightmare. 
---
At least she'll have a guide for it!
---
When I said "exchanging integrated fractal matrices for encryption keys." I was talking about [integrated fractal matrices](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Integrated_Fractal_Matrix), you get one for free for each completed CM and these can't be sold. They are different from [stabilizing matrices](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stabilizing_Matrix), which are sellable on the trading post between aroung +/- 32s per unit.
---
No you don't fly ove him. You go to right place. Then the game makes move/fly to another place.
---
Yep, those cheap gw2 accounts from before HoT keep paying for themselves.
---
I didnt see it myself, but apparently in the last part there's a new dredge leader, implying that the one we knew died during the battle.
---
Buying is fast!
---
I find that its actually a fight for heal-fb. Stability helps with the wind, resistance helps with the condis, and projectile deletion helps with the adds. Once you get the team aspects down (green on boss, red away from boss) there's not much more to it.
---
Now..... the time it took to learn that was...rough.
---
Skritt math.
---
\*GoT theme music plays\*
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Maybe both?
---
or managing to somehow get downed on the circle near Aurene (Where you'd use the skill to trap Kralk with her) at the end or something, idk
---
No i mean the Destroyer. Not an Elder Dragon, only a minion i know.
---
Well then I hope they were also offended by the mixing of African/Middle Eastern cultures in Elona...otherwise it’s hypocrisy.
---
Hello kite. Could you have the other elitists go through you for approval so we don't have to suffer from trash music anymore? Thanks in advance. xoxo.

---
This video hyped me up more than anything
---
Yeah, I'm a stickler for doing things in order as well. Though it doesn't help that I keep playing alts and can't decide on my main to progress the story with..
---
Thank God I prefer pve then. In wvwvw I play the dreaded permanent invisible build and avoiding AoEs is super easy and I guess to add more on this " magical healer build" depending on the range of the heals could make it very viable.
---
As for pvp not huge in it at all but if you have a very good dps "stealth healer" team I can see it being very annoying yes you are down a person but the possibility of having an unkillable duo could be troll worthy.
---
PvE other then world bosses you can safely heal with zero problems again this made up option relies heavily on range healing options and what they would be.
---
I feel like this is the majority opinion of those who played gw1 from the start (or at least enjoyed multiple years of it). I was absolutely deflated the first couple hours after release of gw2. To put it in perspective, only 1 person I played gw1 with stuck around and played. 
---
I personally disappeared for over a year after release. Missed all of the early living world seasons. When I did come back LA was destroyed and I had no idea why. Over time (and many hours in WvW) I’ve learned to like the game for what it is. 
---
But in my opinion one can’t compare this game to gw1. Guild wars 1 was better in almost every aspect. 
---
I'm as much of a fan of the usual highschool musical themed benchmarks as you are.
---
At the end of the day, there was an obvious counter to everything. Sticking an enchantment rip mesmer mob in a 55 monk farming area nerfed the area. Rolling an enchantment rip mesmer into PvP countered all enchant spam builds. Some of that exists in GW2, but it is much easier to spam boons or condis to the point where even a counter can struggle. 
---
you dont do anything wrong. HoT and PoF attract different sorts of players. and dont forget that *completely* new ppl probably would buy PoF than HoT.
---
i still remember the hype about being villain like and letting us deal with problems with violence. like punching npc to give us what we want etc. the personality system. that wasnt rly implemented like it was hyped to be.
---
another thing that was hyped were environmental objects that every class can utilize differently. unfortunately we didn't get much of it like ele can make a meteor from a rock. 
---
story wise gw2 isn't so good obviously, should've gone with gw1 kind of plot. 
---
but in combat, graphics, gameplay - gw2 wins imo
---
Snaff DID invent a one-way pocket Asura gate. I wonder where that model went...
---
Since this would be a completely new class you can't just say it has restrictions. For all you know the traits could give skills healing options.
---
I guess I should specify in my mind that I would love a trait that had just healing skills that gave invisibility PERHAPS I suck at balancing nor ever done a "build idea" so this is just me throwing up in my mind what I would like to see.
---
Again  saying what would work and not work is tough
---
TLDR - new thief trait where all skills healing/buff and give stealth.
---
Looks like a tan Lady Gaga. It's beautiful.
---
Even nowadays you have no proper healer or tank. You have lite versions of them. "Tanks" in gw2 are just dpses with mitigation skills and all they do is move bosses around. They don't really tank anything. They just kite and dodge. Same.with Healers, just a dps with a few healing skills slapped on, you can't even target your allies directly.
---
owo
---
I didn’t like it tbh I just play guild wars 1... guild wars 2 is all about micro transactions :( I wish anet would release more expansions for guild wars 1!!! 
---
The only ones monumentally stupid are the players who took Jackoff's speech as gospel.
---
generic? ...eso is the only one remotely similar and that came after gw2

I love your enthusiasm!  I've missed my first time projection (some things came up near the end in my personal life that I had to deal with), but I hope to have something for everybody to use by this weekend.  I've got a new post (here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/afpxum/for_those_interested_in_blish_hud_overlay/) that I'm asking for some feedback on what features people want to ensure I'm focusing on the correct things in my development.  :)

Looks like I missed my deadline here.  More details here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/afpxum/for\_those\_interested\_in\_blish\_hud\_overlay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/afpxum/for_those_interested_in_blish_hud_overlay/)
---
Well, I hope this post can serve as starting point for that discussion.  
---
I agree, they are interesting, and in my eyes also important, topics.  
---
What I find especially interesting is that some players seem to profit from playing games (e.g. people who feel normal ending up feeling even better with their lives, or people who felt down finding some sort of support or motivation in games), while others seem to be doing well in life and apparently sort of crash after they start playing a game and therefore experience a severe negative influence.
---
Or, on the smaller and possibly more relevant scale you mentioned, just our day-to-day playing that may leave us feeling down (though I especially get that in LoL, not so much here).  
---
As far as I am aware there is only little comprehensive research on this topic so far (I can't take researchers seriously that just assume all games and gamers are the same without actually having results that indicate that; and a good amount of research that does make these assumptions ends up not finding significant correlations). That's why I am doing this study :-)
---
I politely disagree, I did not enjoy being the side kick
---
The bonuses are the same for both builds with the exception of eagle rune's (effectively 5%) bonus and the accuracy sigil.  All other bonuses will cancel each other out.
---
[This](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQJAsNA-jxCBQBQVPAN2foSqoMKVB0qaFA4EAEgHAAWUqUGlRpVJIZVSEA4AY9qHAnf+6rv+618zP/8zP/8zP/8SBonWL-e) is a strictly better setup to get the same results as the build you've posted (still using the same rune/sigil loadout).  It is closer to the pack rune setup, but still inferior.
---
Veteran Graveling still does not drop the plate. Day 2 of wasting my Light of Deldrimor item I spent time both yesterday and today farming. Killed it 10+ times both today and yesterday, no drop. Please fix this content!
---
so why do I get lower numbers even if I just use the discretize calculator?
---
Oh no! Let me fix that. 
---
I'll throw a white glove at you, heavensward's story was brilliant
---
bring your hot male charr and we can make out (;
---
Well looks like I'm gonna bout up GW1 tomorrow. I loved the individual class armor, luckily Heritage armor helps me get that OG mesmer look. Now I just need time to play again
---
I'm glad that my clones give me hints where the enemy is. Reported it a few weeks ago.
---
Link is working now!
---
only get the first mount from pof which you get from the first story mission, then look into starting HoT story and doing the meta on each of the core maps.
---
Outside of Verdant Brink all are still actively done done daily by many players.
---
Besides hot metas, most players are active in the newest living story map and istan
---
I'll just test tomorrow, i could be completely wrong of course.
---
Cannons till mobs start to blink inside the boat, leave cannons and cleave them and put a single reflect/deflect for projectiles and done.
---
Thanks for confirming! 😊
---
The 3 year (!) wait between this and the actual release was pretty excrutiating.
---
Warhammer was the first to try this idea with public quests. Which i think got expanded upon in rift and gw2 then eso
---
My bad I wrote that wrong, I meant anything below 3.0 not 5.0.
---
The Sylvari did not turn out the way I thought they would. I figured they'd be a more whimsical, wide-eyed, almost childish race. They're young, sure, but their models lost a lot of the human-esque features and their story is dark as fuck.

4:55 is the best dialogue on the map. Thank you for recording all this so I didn't have to.
---
Good lord, I remember all those CoF runs I used to cheese with my guild 
---
Tbh though in Gw1 you never returned to most areas because there just wasn't anything in it. A few could be farmed but otherwise you did the story, maybe the 100% and then never saw it again.
---
I think Gw2 does that a bit better though obviously not that much but I don't know any game that does. 
---
This episode felt really short. And the map really empty (event wise) 
---
Exactly

Thats not at all what he is saying

This is actually the most interesting approach to EP 6 i have read yet. Holy Moly Sir. This is an awesome idea.
---
+1 for a dev discord. Been following this project since the last post and I would love to see it come to fruition.
---
If you didn't like it before, you probably won't like it now.
---
Alliances won't change the gamemode at all, they'll just reorganize people. The fundamentals and objectives aren't part of that update.
---
Granted this is speaking from an NA perspective, but the *game* itself hasn't changed much.

---
I would strongly recommend at least making an alt / raptor grabbing character. The mounts are an amazing area traversal option and greatly speed up your exploration and progression.
---
Just make sure you take the time to explore the worlds even if you're going faster, though! There's lots of interesting stuff to find. Jumping puzzles in particular are really cool in the core Tyria (non-expansion) areas.
---
You guys are still stuck in the pre-expansion 1 mindset looks like when the content was alot easier. Post expansion 1, with harder content like fractals and raids the use of specialised roles such as healer and tanks became more necessary. But gw2 still give you the option to customise your group based on how good your group is. This is actually a positive or the game not a minus. 
---
Your mind set is black and white and artificially want every encounter to be handled  by the inflexible dps healer tank roles is very outdated. Trinity based systems such as FFXIV are not engaging, its is dumbed down version of what gw2 offers where players just stand there and cast skills. In Gw2 you actually need to kite and cast skills at the same time. 
---
Any class can fit any role doesn't just sound appealing it is appealing. Thats why gw2 is a fun game to play with the amount of customization that it offers for each class. Over all anet has handled the balancing alot better than other developers so far. Balancing for a dumbed down version of the classes to comply with a strict trinity system would be easier to balance but it would no longer be fun.

---
This is approximately how Branding works. 10/10 realism 
---
Great game. Gw1 &gt; Gw2 though. Gw1 just felt more meaningful with everything you did
---
Stunning work. This is magnificently beautiful and well polished. I am eager to give this a try but I want to wait until I hear word from Arenanet. I have never used addons, but I would totally use this!
---
Minor nitpick, we rescued/ avenged DE. Only one member of the group was with us. 
---
For color schemes you could try looking at various flowers, maybe with colors you might be aiming for as far as your theme goes. What I also like to do is go to the Aesthetician NPC on a character I already have and mess around with different hairstyles, skin/fur/bark colors (and types), faces, etc. so I know what to aim for if I need a makeover kit or a total makeover kit after creating my character.
---
Might be a good place to start at least :) 
---
It was a GW1 thing. Chaos gloves in GW1 were a prestige armor piece. It was a huge trend to show off your wealth just the same way legendary weapons are in GW2. If you never played GW1, I could totally see how you'd think this, but it was a GW1 inspired commission so that's probably why you don't get it.
---
Must also be 8 years old and autistic.
---
Poor child.
---
Yeah, if only she'd had a vision. That would have helped. 
---
During the recent guild chat, one of the watchers asked one of the devs if any of the other non player characters died and replied with: we can't tell you yet.
---
While I want to be optimistic and hope that all the named folks survived.. I know that isn't entirely realistic in that situation given the magnitude of that blast.
---
Well, that's not true if you're going for achievements, or if you're doing stuff like Vanquishing.  Some of the most fun modes to Vanquish in hard mode were low level zones... for me anyway. 
---
Exact same thing happened to me because I was trying to be a cool kid and fly my griffon through the last part. I got out by using the springer.
---
My hype was a real, changing, evolving world that never felt the same.
---
My letdown came after LW S1. They had something really amazing, and dropped it? Out of fear that new people wouldn't want to start in the middle? Out of time and content management concerns? I dont know.
---
But the rolling, evolving story in LWS1 was everything I wanted from an MMO, and now I'm back to square one, chasing the dragon of immersive world MEOW games.
---
Thabks for the answer 
---
I loved it back before HOT but then guild died out and wvw became empty after or before prime timeand pvp became a clown fiesta that even bots can get you a 60/40 w/l :(
---
Missing the good old 5v50 and pvp fights that lasted more then 2 seconds or 4 dodgeroles :(
---
Why?
---
GvG in EU is still played, unlike NA. 
---
We have a discord for organizing stuff and well general communication.
---
Out of more relevant guilds from 2018, i believe only Ash and vi aren't active.
---
Open WvW is terrible imo.
---
That's what I meant by 100%. Then you return to it a few times if you fail but you see the area differently.
---
100% map you're rushing around on the edges pretty much and vanquishing you're far more focused on the mobs instead of the map.
---
And then again, that's to concludeable reasons to return, once its done its done.
---
But for some reason it just made me remember rushing people through some areas, but again that's kinda like farming. 
---
I thought I could I customize my character skillset/weaponskills more... like in GW1.
---
Also, as you start going to new areas, check out the world bosses. Most zones have one on a timer and world bosses offer decent xp and an intro to open world group events like the metas in the expansions.
---
Dumb down in terms of build diversity but 100x better in combat mechanics and balancing. I'd say it was a good trade off. I wouldn't want to play GW1, which essentially was a WoW clone with more customization, given how much more fun gw2 combat has been.
---
GW2 PvE was disappointment compared to GW1. I ended up quitting after hitting level 80 and trying out some fractals and some. I think the issue was the lack of hero system so you kind of felt alone and needed to play this game with friends which in return would make it too easy.
---
I came back later on after I got wanted a break from LoL and ended up finding some things I like, namely WvW and Fractals. At some point I started liking PvP. And now I have somewhere above 12 000 hours in the game. I have played thro the base story a few times and each expansion once so not too much of it is PvE, mostly WvW because I feel like the connection between the people is strongest there.
---
Anyways I wouldn't say GW2 is a great PvE game due to well the build up in the base story is pretty terrible and seems like it runs in circles but it is same in all MMOs tbf. If they had managed to nail the world bosses with a few extra mechanics each, I think the game woulda been bigger hit.
---
I do not like current WvW meta tho which means I am kinda on semibreak and log in occassionally.... The commanders don't like the way it is designed requiring too much brain/organisation to survive and you don't really get to outplay enemies on personal level anymore.
---
Chaos gloves in GW1 were the real deal. Ohhh I miss this game
---
Pretty sure it's also something everyone did differently then. I don't think I've vanquished actively with more than 1 character and also only in a completionist sort of way.
---
Most time I spend farming underworld, fissure of woe, gate of pain and whatnot, open world farming, or done missions for/with people. Or just chatting in one of the cities. 
---
Until hard mode came out then I spent tons of time vanquishing 
---
Excuse me for not giving you a proper response after an insult like that, go fuck yourself. Again, no u.
---
I spent all my time Totam Axe farming with all kinds of different builds. My favorite ones to mention are W/N with Flesh Golem and W/E with Meteor Shower.
---
GW2 is a disappointment in the builds department.
---
WvW leading is terrible in Path of Fire (current expansion) meta.
---
HoT meta was way better after people started playing the game again (slightly before they removed 2 of the desert maps).
---
Anyways you cannot make any mistakes in this meta like backing in a corner, backpedaling, taking bombs, running wrong build, getting jumped on, staying wrong distance from enemy, bad reaction time, ressing rallybots that die first with full zerk gear else you will lose. The game was waaaaay more forgiving before HoT where only thing you needed to pay attention to as commander was necro bomb.
---
Since you're on EU, PvP is fine, theres still plenty of tryhards, NA is a joke tho where new players can reach plat in 2 weeks. Low plat is pretty bad tho.
---
Theres lot of players on WvW just well there is barely any organisation on any server, server meetings are people talking in circles, GvG guilds are secluded from rest of the community, commanders mostly don't teach anyone just run around "playing for fun". I am gonna make a bold claim that you won't see any of the good commanders from pre-hot leading anymore.
---
You might like the game tho, it is pretty fun depending on your timezone and who you follow but man...... Don't expect massive blobfights, they're pretty onesided now and end in like 5-15ish seconds.
---
I cant forget that glint, once more, Just lead us to a glorious defeat. Just like with Destiny edge...
---
Thats some material to speculate
---
Thank you all... Good to know I can buy the plates on the TP
---
&gt;.&gt; Playing sylvari ranger myself as well. A soulbeast. Though I'm extremely tempted to switch over to charr revenant.
---
Nice post, sums it up perfectly for me. 
---
There definitely is a lot less to chose from and the individuality is lacking. But at least in the beginning it was also completely differently balanced by the dodging / spacing for example.
---
Its kinda sad that by now there are pretty much 2-3 builds for a class that can be used for any situation and everything else is along the lines of "you could do that, but why would you?" 
---
Hello, i am looking to get into the game and willing to spend some money to do so, i see a lot of sales going on and was wondering if there was a "complete edition" or something close to that that comes with all the dlc and optional content, i want to experience everything the game has to offer, any advice would be appreciated, thank you!
---
So, given the changes to the world map a ways back, it's possible we'll get the Blood Legion Homelands as a new zone, either for Episode 6 or at some point in the next Living World season.  People have also been suggesting Kralkatorrik might head back there to recover from the damage he took during the recent battle.
---
If we do in fact go to the Blood Legion Homelands next Episode in pursuit of Kralkatorrik and end up dealing with him by the end of it, I can easily see this going a certain way.  
---
We already know that Bangar Ruinbringer, the Blood Legion Imperator, isn't exactly a fan of the peace treaty with Humans, that he is "distrustful and prone to rage".  He's not just going to let us walk into his home territory armed to the teeth and tell him "we're here to take care of your dragon problem", and we don't have the time to spend on changing his mind.  Things are currently the most dire they've ever been.  If Kralkatorrik is in the Blood Legion Homelands there's no way we resolve that situation without stepping on the toes of everyone in our way.  If worst comes to worst we'll have to fight our way through because the situation is just too dire to worry about the consequences of not doing so.  And all this is assuming we manage to satisfactorily deal with the massive problem that is Kralkatorrik.  What if he blows up and nukes the entire Blood Legion Homelands because of our interference, or things go wrong in any of a dozen other ways?
---
And just like that, we've got the perfect hook for the start of Living World Season 5.  We've dropped a prime international incident smack dab in the middle of the powder keg that is Charr-Human relations.  The Blood Legion would be calling for our head, the peace treaty would be ruined, and a potential Charr civil war would start brewing.  The Claw of the Khan-Ur that Smodur has would come up again; maybe Bangar would try to make a grab for it.  The remnants of the Flame Legion would reemerge.  And we'd seriously regret swearing a certain oath back in Season 3 Episode 6.
---
The Shining Blade.  As much as everyone thinks One Path Ends was a waste of time that unnecessarily tied up all the loose ends relating to Lazarus, if this is the way the story ends up going, then forcing our characters to join the Shining Blade actually ends up being brilliant instead of unnecessary.  The Charr-Human conflict wouldn't be as great a concern to a Norn, Asura or Sylvari, but by binding all player characters to the Shining Blade, we'll be drawn in to the chaos whether we like it or not.  This also lets the writers get around the problem of having a split in alliances between Charr and Human players, if all of them are magically obligated to serve Krytan interests, whether they like it or not.
---
Given the fallout from our actions to take down Kralkatorrik and people's loss of trust in us, the Shining Blade might even force us against our will to give ourselves up as a sort of sacrificial lamb.  What I'd really like to see in Season 5 is a scenario where the Commander is on the run, being hunted by all of Tyria, vilified and hated by almost everyone they knew.
---
Who knows, maybe it might be a good idea to hide out down south of Elona for a while...
---
I feel like this is the nature of serials though. That's generally how serials are structured...think soap opera. You either like that sort of thing or you don't. I do. 
---
happened to me too when using my grffion
---
Or maybe like a time limit to beat Kralk..
---
Oh, I know what it means. I was just wondering why ArenaNet does not use it in their descriptions anymore.
---
Global CD, trinity based, slow combat. These 3 factors alone are enough to say its a wow clone.
---
Build diversity is not a thing if you copy and paste  builds from snowcrows yeah. But alot of other builds are possible and often not that different dps wise but gain alot more survivability.
---
GW1 was the one that has balancing problems. Thats why you had a bunch of weird looking niche builds.
---
allowing us to convert between them would be amazing or even better allow us to trade them for statuettes
---
You could not delete a character? That's a new one.
---
Ok so all relevant wvw guilds dead still :( or did any of them reform under different name ( df ash ta ve etc )
---
&gt; "Just In Case" hoarding. 
---
Such a real gw2 feeling
---
Gw1 I built what I felt like and worked it out. I didn't care about being a cookie cutter since I was having fun changing up my build.
---
Gw2, I feel like content is balanced around cookie cutter builds, so I don't bother building my character. I just copy a guide. I dislike weapon swapping being part of a rotation. I dislike how some fights feel clunky. 
---
[removed]
---
This rings very true for me. Played GW1 for years and initially felt betrayed by GW2. It took coming back with PoF years later and seeing GW2 not as a sequel to GW, but as a totally different and new game for me to like it. As a standalone game, GW2 is fantastic and I love it. As a Guild Wars sequel, it's an abysmal failure. 
---
Same here. 
---
Remember when mesmers were green?
---
Couldn’t agree more. This has to hurt, and with the “I don’t know” line, it already does. If anet keeps the heavy story with proper consequences, it really will be one of the best arcs.
---
Well we’re just going to have to agree to disagree here. 
---
With that logic just about every game is/ was a wow clone. But I’ve honestly never heard anyone say GW1 was a WoW clone. In fact, GW2 changed the formula entirely to appeal to WoW’s player base because if you liked WoW, you didn’t like GW1 and vice versa. 
---
I theory craft constantly for GW2. The only “diversity” is min/maxing gear.
---
I agree GW1 had balancing problems. That’s why it was nicknamed “Build Wars”. But to say Anet has figured out how to balance GW2 (competitive modes) is a joke. 
---
With respect to balance, they are getting better by splitting skills for each game mode but it’s still bad. 
---
Thanks for the answer
---
I was leading pre HoT; HoT; and PoF ( where i finaly quit 4 months ago ) 
---
I cant realy say that this full tank runaway meta was much fun for me :( 
---
As of for what you daid with more forgiving and why ... this took out all strategy in wve fights for me wich made them do boring 1 push or run :(
---
Also noticed wgen i wasbleading i ended up killing the enemy 2 or 3 times wile defending or open field fights and they just simply switch border to PPT ot log off did this atleast change that people want to fight in a well massive pvp mode or do they still prefer hitting doord on most servers?
---
IDk been quite a while since I've done any raids.
---
For fractals however you would need 12-24 pages from recs and can get 3 per day.
---
Water beats... rock?
---
you are wrong about it being caused by elementalists, the invisible mobs bug can happen even in parties with no eles, anet is aware of the bug, but they also don't know what causes it so they haven't been able to fix it
---
&gt; I think Gw2 does that a bit better though obviously not that much but I don't know any game that does.
---
ESO since the One Tamriel update. It has upscaling instead of downscaling like in GW2. It's one of the reasons why I was sad they brought downscaling to WoW instead of upscaling, WoW has many ghost zones and that was their motivation to bring in scaling in the first place.
---
OP, please note: you don't have to be level 80 to get the mount. Party someone who is level 80, ask them to do the PoF first story mission with you, and in the end of that you should be having your Raptor. (just turn off all chats and ignore everything in the screen to avoid story  spoilers!) 
---
Oh! I've got one. 
---
"Courting Nightmare!" 
---
it's fcking mesmerising... get it? :D 
---
Okay! thank you so much for this, this answers all my questions, have a great day!
---
Hey guys, some buddies of mine are gonna start playing GW2 and I was going to join them since I played before. I keep getting the Error 1038 for an invalid serial code, but I had no issues logging in before I uninstalled the game a while back. I submitted a ticket but haven't had a response yet from support. Any thoughts? 
---
Yeah, having to actually change gear is what I was thinking for some dps players. I'm not sure how many people actually carry around different sets, though.
---
Happens if you name it with weird characters. You can input them to "create" but not to "delete". It's funny how input boxes work xD.
---
SA + slippery slope + stick together.  
---
The real CM
---
Yep. Players in gw2 need to adjust their rotation based on how much heals they are getting, whether they have quickness, alacrity, stability. while complying with mechanics. This is much more freshing and engaging  than trinity games.
---
&gt; you can't even target your allies directly.
---
One of the best things in the game. You don't look at the UI, you look at the fight.
---
I can honestly say I've never been more hyped for the release of any video game - or any*thing*, for that matter - more than I was for GW2.  Its announcement came at a time I getting burnt out on WoW (end of Wrath of the Lich King).  I was still craving an MMO to, but I just couldn't do the rinse and repeat raid grind anymore.  It all began to feel so arbitrary.  
---
When I read Mike O'Brien's [Design Manifesto](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/guild-wars-2-design-manifesto/) I was instantly sold.  I agreed with every word they said.  I proceeded to follow their developer blog posts religiously.  Every word resonated with me.  It was exactly how I would design my perfect MMO.  It felt like I was designing my dream MMO alongside them.
---
In may ways, GW2 absolutely lived up to my hype.  Two keystone features that GW2 did and continues to do better than any other MMO, in my opinion, are 1) map completion as an open world experience, and 2) single player combat. 
---
**Open World and the Transition to Events over Quests**
---
I am so grateful to GW2 for how it advanced the MMO "open world" concept.  I thought WoW had done a fantastic job creating races, zones, and starter zones with distinct "personalities" or flavors. I thought it did this better than any game that came before it, as well as better than every game that came after it that I had tried (Rift, Aion, Tera, Age of Conan).  But GW2 *finally* surpassed WoW in this regard.  I play MMOs to become immersed in the world.  Every race and starter zone was absolutely *bursting* with a unique feel and experience, from the honorable hunting culture of the Norn, to the quirky, cocky tinkering of the Asura.  It was a joy to play and level every race.  
---
But my god, the way every zone played was *so much fun.*  After 8 years of nothing but quests - literally *tens of thousands of quests*, map completion with Hearts, POIs, Waypoints, Vistas, jumping puzzles, skill challenges and *dynamic events* was a tremendous breath of fresh air.  It retained just enough elements of the traditional quest so players wouldn't get too lost (which is something the devs discovered was happening during the initial player trials), but instead placed a huge focus of the open world experience on *exploration*.  Go.  Seek out these high points and landmarks on the map.  The quests will come to *you*!  Naturally.  It felt so organic and fluid.  GW2 has literally ruined any other MMO for me that is now based on a quest system.  The only game that adds enough narrative flavor to their quest system so I can at least stomach it for a little while is FFXIV...
---
The one thing I SO wish they were able to manage with their open world is the removal of loading screens between zones within a continent.  I don't know what makes WoW's technology different from virtually every other MMO out there, but I think it's so amazing to be able to walk for hours across the whole continent without experiencing a loading screen.  Particularly, the *transitions* that occur as you move from one zone to another in WoW are amazing.  
---
I log into a WoW trial account annually around Halloween every year just to wander from Elywnn Forest into Duskwood.  You start in a sunny, "happy" little farm forest, but soon after you cross the river, the canopy becomes ever darker, covering the path in shadows.  You begin to see giant cobwebs appear in the trees around you.  Soon it's so dark that the path needs to be lit by lanterns.  Suddenly, a wolf howls in the distance!  
---
Heh, like I said, I'm a sucker for open world immersion.  I thought those zone transitions were so integral to that effect in WoW.  I can't help but lament would could have been for GW2.  
---
**Single Player Combat**
---
I have to emphasize the "single player" here.  I won't go into too much detail here, but suffice it to say that GW2 has again ruined any attempt I ever make at returning to WoW because I simply cannot get back into what now feels like *absurdly slow combat* compared to GW2's ultra fast, fluid style.  Executing my dashes and dodges with my D/D Elementalist while landing numerous self combos is just the best feeling I've ever experienced from a solo standpoint in MMO combat.  I simply cannot stand still in a game like WoW anymore and spam 3 second cast time spells.  I just can't do it.  Ruined.  
---
That said, something needs to be said about multi-player combat.  Off the bat, when GW2 launched, I played with several friends, and we tried desperately to combo off of each other.  We were all looking forward to the feature.  But it always just felt like chaos.  Everything ended up being a 'passive' combo, completely inadvertently executed.  Everything was too fast and spammy individually to allow for the slowing up to create intentional combos.  It was almost always better to execute your own personal optimal rotation than to change it up significantly to land timed combos with friends.  
---
With that said, most of my friends quit GW2 after just a few months, which left me playing mostly solo.  I've joined several guilds here and there, but it's hard to ever replace that OG group of friends you made.  As a result, I've never gotten the true group experience in GW2.  I've never done a raid.  I hear they're actually pretty well done, and I'd love to get a little more hard core like my WoW glory days and try them out one day.  But I can't accurately speak to the state of GW2's multiplayer combat nowadays.  
---
***
---
What I do know, to tie both of those points together, is that GW2's open world allows for the most easily accessible cooperative play I've ever seen in an MMO.  I can't tell you the number of times I've tried to level up with a friend in quest-based MMOs.  You all know what I'm talking about.  
---
You say, "Hey, man.  You're a cool dude.  I love playing with you.  We should level alts together."  
---
They say, "Right on!  That sounds like a solid plan, mate." 
---
You both create alts after 45 minute of character creation and 2 bathroom breaks.  Then you're off enjoying questing together.  You get maybe 7 levels together before calling it a night.  You bid each other farewell for the evening.  
---
You log back on the next day, hoping to level with your buddy again, only to find that he's now level 12 and in the next zone!  "WTF!?", you think.  You message him, and he assures you that you'll still level together.  But how?  If he comes back to your zone, he literally has *nothing* to do.  So it just doesn't happen.  You can try to catch up, but the fact of the matter is it just doesn't happen. 
---
Or maybe the opposite happens.  You log in and you REALLY want to play your alt, but what?  You can't, just because your buddy isn't on right now?  Why shouldn't you be able to play what you want?  That's not fun. 
---
The fundamental issue is that both players have different levels of availability and desire to play the alt character, which is totally fine.  But a game like WoW simply doesn't accommodate that.  In GW2, however, the player who gets ahead, absolutely 100% *can* come back and join the player who is behind.  He'll be a relevant level; he'll continue to gain significant experience, and they'll both encounter tons of events together.  It's SUCH a better system for playing with friends!
---
I guess it’s a perspective thing. I’m a WvW player. I have 1,000’s of hours in WvW. I really, really want to enjoy PvE but I think it’s garbage... particularly the early stuff. I do think the newer stuff is decent. 
---
So as a WvW player, I think balance in this game is bad. 
---
GW2 was marketed as a WoW killer. Everyone (literally everyone) I played GW1 didn’t like WoW and thought GW1 was uniquely different in a good way. Also, every WoW player I introduced GW1 to said it was dumb and they quit after a week or two. 
---
The tank/ dps/ heal roles that are now present in GW2 were not a thing early on. That was anets selling point after all. Now, with the introduction of hard core PvE modes it’s a thing. Personally I wish they would have stuck with “holy trinity” from the start since eventually it would be introduced anyways. 
---
The lack of specific roles early made PvE a lonely experience. Why interact when you can solo everything? Open world is still like this. No one talks or parties up because they don’t have to. This was one of the reasons I started playing WvW because there was a sense of community. Something GW1 had. Now WvW is a shit show because Anet decided to ignore it completely in favor of designing new skins for the trade post. 
---
Yeah, I got this bug on Firebrand with Mantra and F1 but the bug seems to be a mix of Visual and False Cooldown tracking.
---
Exemple: On Firebrand, when the bug happen your Mantra didnt refresh but if you are at 1 ammo and gain 1 ammo you will pass from 1 to 3... But if you use the last charge the Mantra get on cooldown...
---
Maybe the bug happen with Ammo system. I never get it with an other Classes than Firebrand personnaly.
---
I read on one of the earlier weekly question threads that it's incorrect to believe that hearts are not a set path or required (basically not a necessary questline). If that's so, then what are they? And if it's not really required to do them, what else is there exploration-wise that gives such good xp?
---
&gt; . And just before this a crystal springs up and blocks escape, o you can no longer enter
---
Not entirely true. While it does give the illusion that there are tons of blocker, you can enter and leave by above the big crystal blocker either with a springer or a griffon.
---
If everyone hates the commander theni t gives a story reason for a new commander...say... a TENGU COMMANDER????!?!?!?!?!!!!??
---
Ya we bleed fire can get insane if you have allot of mobs being hit.
---
It could likely use a bit better indicator that its about to go off.
---
Birds are just frankly annoying &amp; depending if they can proc afflicted could be insanely hard.
---
/s 
---
Hell even letting reflects just stop them would be nice.
---
Even letting reflects just stop them would be nice
---
The tank dps heal roles didn't really get introduced with expansion 1. They were always there. Just that the necessity to use them was introduced with expansion 1 with raids and fractals because that was harder content. 
---
Again the trinity was there from the start, just that the game allowed players to control their characters really well players were able to get past alot of the easier pre expansion 1 content with just dps builds. But players could have had a healer and tank if they wanted to (i.e in bad groups).  The variety was there but never used. Even now with harder content you can still have variety for the different roles, for tank for example you can have condi dps tank, healer tank, boon share tank, its not just strictly "tank" there are alot of variety to it. 
---
Except you couldn't solo everything. People who soloed dungeon runs were like 0.0001% of the population and is not indicative of what typically happens. World bosses you couldn't solo. Guild missions you couldn't solo. And so on. How about you interact because of chance encounters and you share content that you like not because certain content force you to be together?
---
events (this is the big one), points of interest, vistas, hero points, pretty much just the process of exploration itself is better exp than just doing the hearts.
---
The idea behind hearts is that they act more like hubs. When you go to an area with a heart, you'll find some points of interest, some unexplored areas, some vistas, some events happening, etc. and they're just easily marked on your map. While they do give some decent exp on their own, it's just tedious to try and do every heart immediately
---
u/monstrum27 not gonna lie, my immediate thought upon completion of the episode was "The next comic is gonna be daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrkkkkkkkkkkk"
---
Honestly I wouldn't get a mount for my first run. Think of mounts like cars, you zoom by so fast you'd easily miss the minor details and Anet is *amazing* with minor details. 
---
Another benefit of not having mounts is you'll pay attention at your build better. Which trait and skills add Swiftness? Which trait has passive moving speed increase? Which skills have leaps? Which skills have blocks and invulnerabilities when running past dangerous mobs etc?
---
Lastly there's the delayed gratification. My alt account is level 75 now. I didn't boost my alt account because core Tyria 2g dailies are easier and less time consuming than expansion dailies. 
---
are you saying that VG and escort  are harder than recs?
---
Mellitus has more than one meaning.
---
Like honey, sweet, etc.
---
Mellitus comes from Latin, to do with honey/sweet. It makes sense that a chef would have a food related name (in this case honey), and it's kind of cute that a charred has a name that means 'sweet'.
---
While diabetes mellitus shares the mellitus name due to that type of diabetes having lots of sugar in body fluids, I find it more likely that the name was chosen in-game more due to its Latin roots than its connection to diabetes.
---
To compare it to something else, it would be like thinking someone named "fire" was a reference to fire ants.
---
That said, 'mellitus' is most often used these days when talking about diabetes mellitus so the association is understandable.
---
I mean, I would definitely hold off on the taco markers for now.  TBH I was always looking for an all in one solution and really want an alternative to taco, but since it IS available it could probably be paused to make room for other things at this time.  Same goes for any other features that already have some alternative means of being provided like cursor finder (yolomouse).
---
I'm not sure why you didn't get the code but support is the way to go. It's both a weekend and the week after a large update so support will be especially backed up, I would never expect an answer within just a few hours. 
---
The problem has been fixed a number of times but keeps sneaking back. I just pushed a change that should go out with the next hotfix version, should fix the issue. Sorry!
---
I understand where you are coming from, but a worst case Matthias scenario where the Chronos are overloaded with mechanics, sacrificed (!) AND need to constantly delay their rotations to ress others isn't something I consider relevant when talking about standard builds and gear.
---
There might certainly be niche scenarios where you will want to make very specific changes to your build and rotation but those aren't simple enough to quickly explain them. The go to build I recommended runs 65,8% boonduration. That means that both Chronos could miss two Tides of Times each and Alacrity would still not drop. 
---
As for your other examples. I am suprised you'd make a case for that as you've already voiced concern about uptimes. If you drop TW for CC, Mimic for Recall and precast your WoA to make up for the TW drop you would need a total of 100% boonduration to maintain quickness. And that would still be a tight rotation.
---
There is ways to deal with all the problems you've mentioned and hard-carry pugs through everything but none of that is knowledge I could add here quickly as a sidenote.
---
Themes are a potential future feature, but we haven't really nailed down where it should go... That said, u/TheCheatsrichter has some really good ideas on it, and I don't doubt it will be implemented at some point.
---
I don't see why they'd have to do anything with the fractals, really. They're a bit of a different animal than even the F&amp;F dungeon.
---
The molten facility itself would need some updating probably, but the version of its fights in fractals don't necessarily have to be backfilled into the dungeon. They could be, and it would save effort, but it's not completely required I expect.
---
i came from gw1 and basically devoured every trailer and video i could find. since i didn't want to play another gw1 and wanted something fresh, especially with that promising combat, i was very hyped about gw2 and when it comes to combat it never took away the fun.  
---
yes, the balance could be better, but whatever, i guess anet will never gets it right in those terms.  
---
what is more disheartening is what anet does. everything they take on just fades away over time and they never touch anything again related to that. paired with miss or no communication at all gives a really bad picture about them.  
---
for me it kinda started with the german community manager. martin kerstein did go to arenanet for another job and ramon domke took over (at ncsoft). at some point anet took over the publishing and ramon apparently worked now somewhere else at ncsoft and no new person got to be the CM. since then in germany you basically never hear anything from any dev. you have to go to international channels to see whats going on.  
---
and this was not the only person. remember the economy dev? is there one now? is the place empty or does the new one just not want to talk with us?  
---
remember the pvp dev which organized stuff? well guess what, he is gone and i never heard from any other dev in there now.  
---
remember when speedrunning / hardcore guilds where invited to playtest stuff? 1 or 2 idiots leaked stuff and instead that those get punished, the whole community gets punished since no guild got invited since then to playtest anything. so there is basically no exp. group somwhere testing stuff to give feedback.  
---
and the same applies to content. be it stuff like more guild missions, dungeons, raids or fractals, pvp or wvw.  
---
sure there are updates. but they are degrading over time. first everything comes out big and flashy, and then over time it just degrates more and more. updates get spare or nothing gets updated at all over a long time.  
---
you can directly feel how to marketing from the company says: this is what gives us money, we need to do content for exactly that. even tho the living world episodes got a bit less, you can feel how much more manpower is directed at them and at the same time how to shop gets an update everytime one comes out so people buy a shitton of loot boxes to open.  
---
you can see it with what they announce with the teams. like the fractal and raid team is now one team...okay...and how many got taken off that team so they can work one something else?  
---
where are the posts from the previous active crystal reid giving us updates about raids? suddenly gone...and she is not the only one.  
---
but my biggest gripe with the company is that apparently the left hand doesn't know what the right hand does. i get it, they are not the smallest. but i am also not in a small company and i hear everyday who is working on what and what our fans / customers say. we care about and if we get any info which others maybe don't have, we give it to them.  
---
from what anet employees sometimes write and how bugs are sometimes left unfixed and then the complete silence instead of good community interaction is really really not a nice feeling.  
---
at the moment i play warframe. there are 2 devs playing every friday together with the community towards their goals. they listen. they update us about new stuff. they have a shitton of excitement you would never feel in any gw2 stream. and the best thing is....they meme arround...a lot. and with those memes and jokes they have the community at their side nearly 24/7. they listen to complains, they fetch ideas and often you can see people write on the reddit: hey, i had this idea 3 months ago and wrote it to this dev on twitter and now look, its in the game!  
---
storys like this exist in gw2. but those are really rare moments and while gw2 is a community which is nice but also "toxic" when she has to because something is wrong in their eyes...in warframe you can see those bad reactions about something way less.  
---
i just wish they would step up their streams quite a bit. make 1 2 3 giveaways of 400 - 800 gems each stream. include twitch drops like "you watched half an hour of our stream, here have this fancy table for the guildhall" or have random drops of (accbound) skins or something like that.  
---
just...step up your communication, not only on the outside, but also on the inside and a lot will be much better.
---
I honestly don't think that's the case for these GW1 veteran. GW1 is the epitome of your regular mmorpg, do question mark &amp; fetch quest type, many button for skill+build your own combo ability (not that it doesn't have a good point). Meanwhile, i believe GW2 has the option to reach max level without killing a single thing (it'll be hard and tedious but it's possible) not only by crafting, but also myriad of non combat event &amp; hearts, and world exploration. Without the change that happen in GW2 from GW1, it won't grow to be a popular mmo right it is now. Heck, i never even heard of Guildwars right until GW2, that's how obscure GW1 is outside NA/EU.
---
It's more of nostalgia-hating-meme your way with every new stuff, this happen on every video games ever made. Oh what, you like witcher 3, guess what, i played witcher 2, and witcher 3 doesn't had the spirit of the older predecessor ~~even though it is a much better game~~. What are you talking about? Witcher 2 and 3 are steaming piles of crap, i played witcher 1 and it is much better than the later series. What about this WoW 
---
 expansion, OH NO IT SUCKS, i'll take my vanilla WoW because it's so nostalgia... until it happen and i couldn't careless about it and i'll find something not up to my standard with it. Everquest? RuneScape? Pokemon Red/Blue?
---
Take my experience for example, i am WoW veteran, coming to play GW2 half a year after its release. Then when HoT announced, i tried to play GW1. It's felt like super boring running simulator. Majority of your time is wasted running from one place to another place. The game itself is not even a true MMO, it's more of a lobby based game, where city act as a hub where you can see other player, but outside that, you're alone or at best hunting with your party, you can't see another player in open world.
---
This is my bad. I'm handling the plugins, what were previously called addons, and my dayjobs workload increased. Unfortunately, as a result 1.8 had to be pushed without UI for it.
---
That said, in my opinion what is to come is a much better way of handling things. We will be able to support updating tools from within LB, injecting things like arcdps/gw2hook automatically, and ensuring tools that only support one client (TacO) are closed if a second instance of the game is opened.
---
There are going to be some growing pains though, as I'm expecting I'll have to personally write most of the plugins at first... But tool authors and the public are more than welcome to.
---
More info on this will come with the release of 1.9.
---
See my reply [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/af9no5/launchbuddy_18_release_bigger_than_you_think/ee117ex/).
---
Maybe even two visions. Just to be sure.
---
x.X Sorry I only tested that with emails that contained a single period!
---
I personally would advise against this. GW2 has really enough mobility and waypoints that you will manage without a mount until you get there naturally.
---
They are projectiles and can be reflected, although they do not deal damage upon reflecting. And the projectiles emerge frontally from the mob (where it's head is) and then each 60° (6 projectiles total).
---
The instability adds a new depth to fractals however after 3 days of it being on the same fractal, it’s starting to get a bit annoying. 
---
They aren’t complaining that it’s too hard, only that it being on 100cm 3 days in a row is getting out of hand, which is fair. 
---
So your comment is completely irrelevant to what’s being discussed and was only made to insult this person for no other reason.
---
Good job kiddo 
---
I really can’t see any reason or motive for this to be of any malicious intent whatsoever in the naming of this NPC. I think this is totally different than any of the examples you gave. 
---
Mellitus has a totally different meaning, whereas the examples you gave were just names of people or figures used in a culturally contextual aspect of the game design.  
---
damn, I really feel like the commander now. In my excitement to explore thunderhead  I missed just how depressed and downtrodden everyone truly is
---
Now that you mention it, I do believe this still happens... It's because there's really no proper way for LB to see what's going on with the update.
---
We're still trying to find a better way to handle this, but it's not something that's baked into the client.
---
Or you could ask someone else to play the mission at your PC for you. 
---
I cant even log in with decent fps, since their last update im having 8 fps...
---
thought it was my Windows, so I clean instaled everything. 
---
Changed to a more old driver on gpu still the same, ANet needs to fix the FPS issues real fast. 
---
I cant play with 8 fps.
---
And I had 60 fps all good 
---
on my AMD HD 7870
---
pretty sad :(
---
There are lots of things. Crafting ascended back pieces was what I used mine for  
---
No don't
---
I don't want to spoil anything, just play the last episode
---
You can get to Lion's Arch without an expansion. If you are free to play, you can't get into there until level 30 though. If you head into any of the capitol cities (The Grove, Rata Sum, Hoelbrak, The Black Citadel, or Divinity's Reach) or Lion's Arch, they are all quite active. None of those need any form of financial commitment to enter.
---
yes the expansions are worth it for the PVE stuff, same goes for living world seasons 3 and 4.
---
a lot of people are also off in the newest episodes map, give it a week and a lot of the population spreads out again.
---
The early to mid game maps tend to be relatively empty because most endgame players have no reason to go there outside of a few specific events, and it doesn't take long to hit endgame. The game is still quite populated, it's just not very balanced -- Anet realized a long time ago there was no way to make sure every map was well populated.
---
&gt;If I take 2 of my accounts to a meta event, and get participation with one of them -hit boss a few times for eg- and then afk and swap to the other account. Is that against any rule?
---
Unfortunately, we aren't really experts in GW2 law... That's going to have to be a question for one of the support staff, or during an AMA. 
---
&gt; how taxing it is on the pc to open 2 clients? Any noticeable fps drops? 
---
There will always be some frame loss, though for the most part it all depends on your hardware. There's really no way to say for sure, as even between hardware of the same type there will be variation.
---
Best way to find out is to give it a shot!
---
That said, you could just set all your alts to use the lowest possible graphics settings, which will lower their total drain on resources to the minimum.
---
I've never seen it but a friend of mine has. Though it was just once.
---
More difficult to enter raids via discord over lfg? I disagree. Every gw2 raid vet knows the lfg ingame is annoying and filled with memes, and by extension a TERRIBLE place to learn raids. Think we’ll have to leave it at that. 
---
Composition of chrono/druid/warrior is STRONGGGGGGGG and VERY meta, for exactly the reasons you mention. They just give too many unique amazing buffs and condense roles so nicely. However they’re not NEEDED to do the raids, just, optimal. There’s many people who have done: no chrono, all mesmer, no druids (was part of that once! W2 no druids, had a FB Healer and a chrono Healer. Don’t advise! But lfg memes!), boon thief (on certain bosses), quickbrand/alacgade. The squad comp varies on many kills. It’s just optimal to bring the classic 3. But once you understand, you can bring anything really..... forgot where I was going with this... basically, C/D/W is meta, but not required.
---
As for “forced” comps, anet has addressed it... in a very unsatisfactory way imo... 
---
nerfed chrono (incorrectly!), 
---
buffed FB mantras, 
---
buffed alacrity from ren f4, 
---
buffed overload water on tempest, 
---
nerfed druid (first in might gen, then spotter, then in spirit strength, and even said they’re watching to see if spirits are still TOO strong), 
---
made warrior banners hit 10 (old buff, but stopped the forced 2 warriors, well... they still had 2 for a while due to them being might gen, but gotl change then fixed that [bad move imo]), 
---
gave thieves new steals to help be more raid wanted, 
---
killed ele (no really, used to be ele and nothing else for dps, even on matt for a bit), 
---
killed epi bouncing.
---
Like, anet watches the meta and nudges it here and there to prevent “forced” comps. However, we’re not yet free of the highly HIGHLY imposed C/D/W meta. One I don’t mind ditching, but can’t see it yet. The support is just too strong from those, and the chrono/druid specs were built to be support.
---
Raid boss balance: 100%, SV feels the most balanced for damage types, agreed... minus gors. Power on gors will KILL condi classes due to burst on good players. The reason condi prevails on more bosses than power (I consider only really KC/AC/Gors as power bosses) is just because damage keeps ticking when doing mechanics, and you have the time to ramp up the applications. But, I mean... it’s stacking DoT! With enough time, can see it totally beating out power! Because if power has times where it’s not hitting the boss, it just falls behind. And Anet has said they want power to be bursts, and condi to be over time. It’s why they did the condi overhaul where they killed the application count for duration buff, less condi spike, more condi over time.
---
I’ve said it before, many times in game and to anyone I can, GW2 raid balance won’t be fair, until raid squads make allied targets go from 5 to 10. That will allow spaces for those off meta classes to have a chance! However, there will STILL be a BIS. There always will be. GW2 raids are not tough, so it’s just a matter of “how fast can we kill it?”, not “Can we kill it?”. And THAT is the issue.
---
GW2 lvling is especially boring compared to what? I started playing FF14 like one and half months ago and holy fuck somebody shoot me, please. Besides story so far has been run errands and skip this cutscene.
---
Thank you, follow up question, can I change the color of my attack animations too? 
---
Like say, I don’t like the blue color of the Guardian spells and change it to say red or yellow? 
---
I had seen that alright, but it seemed like without putting some money into it I'll be at a handicap in one way or another, since it's only $15 I don't mind paying but I focus more on PvE and questing. Didn't want to pay and find out I'd be doing everything solo.
---
Ah okay, not sure what that season 3 and 4 you're saying is but I get the gist. Thanks for the reply!
---
If you have a joystick or keypad you can just bid the keys to them, I usually use the razor keypad and sometimes I use the xbox controller when bored. I always use the mount with my mouse tho.
---
Thousands of hours in GW1.  Overhyped the fuck out of GW2 and actually liked it at first.  I had theorycrafted characters for every profession.  Made 10 characters day 1.  2 to save names and 8 to play, one of each profession.
---
Rushed for map completion on my warrior with his rabid dual sword / longbow build back when that was not a good thing.  I didn't care.  Completed it within the first month after about 220 hours.  Burned out hard and pretty much only played for the story for a while.  I have come back here and there, put in a few hundred hours across all those characters, and have just set up a plan to get them at least all in armor and weapons I like.
---
Fashion Wars is my true calling.
---
Bring back Random Arenas.
---
Speaking of writers that recently went away from anet, your craze over the non issue which is the name of that vendor (as others have stated, mellitus means honey/sweet in latin) is starting to sound a lot like jessica prices crazes in relation to misogyny. 
---
🙄
---
On Uncategorized Fractal too ;9
---
Have a nice day~
---
Okay that's no problem, just thought it was very quiet in "The Grove" where I've started out and got worried it would just be me for the whole game. I enjoyed the partying up and doing quest in the first game. Thanks for the reply!
---
between expansions episodic content is released, bridges the story, adds new maps.
---
they're a lot cheaper than full expansions. (season 3 is like $12)
---
I really hope that "losing" is something that is explored and that they don't just right away do a magical fix to erase this massive loss.  I don't know if it's the direction that the story should take, but there is some really interesting things they could do if the PC was suddenly much more alone.   
---
To be honest, I feel like our PC is just too well known everywhere all the time now. Maybe that's just me, but it'd be nice for a convo with a NPC not to involve "hey commander" or "hey, i've heard about you, god killer" etc.  A, "Who the fuck are you?" could be refreshing. Just saying.   
---
That said, I feel like so much of this current story is a reflection of the Destiny's Edge+Glint -&gt; Failure and how PC + pact + Aurene -&gt; failure?  The first time it happened, everybody gave up and went their separate ways. I expect the story to be about us being the "glue" that makes it work this time after the big set back.
---
If you’re interested in the story, then you should grab season 2 as well. Sadly season 1 was an ephemeral release, and can’t be played anymore. 
---
Man same...
---
When I was brought out of the instance there were so many other people there just standing around. Everyone was just afk reevaluating their life choices...
---
You can also bodyblock or destroy the projectiles.
---
oh i have a gamepad too, and use it sometimes.
---
buut wanting something for mouse and keyboard controls, especially since menus are a pain with a gamepad and i cant easily switch back and forth between mouse to gamepad
---
User-&gt;Username-&gt;Appdata-&gt;Local-&gt;Temp-&gt;gw2cache-{some number combination}
---
Probably that one. Isn't really a "fix" tho
---
In Guild Wars 1 everyone was crowded into outposts and those outposts were the only place to see people. Here you can interact with people anywhere in the world. Which means you're not as likely to find people just at outposts, the population is more scattered.
---
Furthermore, I spend far more time talking to the hundred people in my guild than people in map chat anyway, because I know them and like to hang with them.
---
Ahh okay! Thanks!
---
I agree, and I think that could be a really good thing for the story moving forward. 
---
Agreed.
---
I mean, Joko being eaten by aurene would be pretty useless part if it isn't going to be used in some way.
---
What is the best for me to buy first? I think Path of Fire was what I was looking at?
---
what build is this support fb?
---
Bring him to the swimming entrance of Loreclaw jumping puzzle and tell him to find the end chest... with no helping whatsoever. Between the platforming and the traps, that should provide some spice at lvl 12.
---
Font of Rhand minidungeon in Diessa Plateau and Provernic Crypts in Gendarran are also decent to visit at slightly higher levels. Font offers some challenge in terms of puzzle solving, if not helped by anyone, and segues into underwater boss fight which would feel different. Provernic has a big ol’ spider which might prove somewhat annoying without help from an overpowered elite spec lvl 80.
---
By lvl 30, you can chuck him into the Beastpool at Gendarran Fields and make him solo the champion rock dog within the pen, if the group event is up. 
---
As well as take on Ascalonian Catacombs as folk have mentioned - but be careful about bringing a lvl 80 HoT or PoF spec to the fight, it’s too easy to carry or trivialize the difficulty then and he won’t feel it. Just bring an equivalent level char or just watch without helping until he either solos it or decides he could use a hand.
---
Haha I've yet to even see the classic Recruitment message for guilds yet where I am, so that's how I know where I am is empty.
---
Also, is it true you can join multiple guilds at once? Surely that's confusing?
---
SoulKeeper? She was on the 3rd platform along with us but when Kralk was going to blast our ass. She wasn't there behind the shield. I saw her run to the tunnel before being blasted.
---
It’s ok, I wanted to have a sobbing face all night. This is beautiful and really well made, great job!!
---
I did the story in chronological order and i dont regrer it. That includes the living stories.
---
We got a new episode of the Living World (DLC) last Tuesday. Everyone is gravitating there at the moment. Will probably spread out in another week.
---
wait for a couple of weeks until they just bring her back.
---
Hahaha that's pretty apt! Cheers for that man would be helpful as I'm a bit lost in there.
---
absolutely a range finder, not just rings like taco has because that doesnt show properly on hills, but a range finder like bgdm/nabster had where it had the range distance in numbers on their name plates. this wasnt illegal on their mods and got tossed away with the rest of the mods.
---
Hoping for a pet Joko now. He at least has better puns than (chirp) (roar)
---
I ran through it twice. Once with my first character (female Charr), and again with my canon Commander (female Sylvari). There were a few days in between so I could try to collect myself and prepare mentally for a second run of the episode.  
---
First time through I was completely numb and in shock. My mind ran a mile a minute. Maybe more. I threw myself into farming and crafting after to try and take my mind off of things. But when I ran it a second time...  
---
I struggle with anxiety and depression on the daily, so this didn't really help me get to a good place. I struggle with real life stuff and so I come to game to escape and help take that weight off. However it seems the weight has followed me in game. I haven't logged in since yesterday. It's hard to deal with right now. I'm emotionally sensitive and completely exhausted. Parts of me cling to any and every theory people are throwing out to try and cope.
---
But to answer your question:  
---
"I don't know."
---
&gt;Zhaitan was a combined effort. We were just the Commander, the big guy was Trahaerne.
---
Debatable. While the Pact was led by Trahearne who had final say in order of operations, we were the ones who convinced the three Orders to even attempt uniting underneath Trahearne.
---
Trahearne was a figurehead. We pulled the strings that made things move.
---
&gt;Scarlet was a Lion's Arch matter, and while we did provide significant help as well as the finishing blow like glorified assassins, it was mostly concerted by the Captain's Council.
---
Disagreed. We're the ones called the Hero of Lion's Arch, though they've removed most of such dialogue with LA's rebuilding. And it was the Captain's Council thanking us, not the other way around.
---
Hell, the entire reason why LA was so devastated was because of the Captain's Council! It was their incompetence and ignoring our and Kiel's warnings while believing "no one would attack us twice when the first time failed" that resulted in the destruction of LA.
---
We were more than glorified assassins, we were the only sane people in the room.
---
Honestly, it's amazing that everyone but Kiel didn't get fired from the Captain's Council for that.
---
&gt;Episode 5 is different. There, it's all us. And *only* us. *We* rally every. single. army. out there. *We* bring everyone from all over Kryta and Elona. *We* are the sole driving force behind everyone. *We* give one speech after another. *We* are the shining symbol of hope and a better future. *We* are the glorious hero without anyone knowing how [monumentally stupid](https://i.imgur.com/YKVZO9B.jpg) we actually are. *We* bring the prophecy, *we* are the dragon's champion, *we* are the centre, the linchpin, the inspiration.
---
Though it's not the first time it's "all us". Like you said, Balthazar was all us. So was Joko, and technically so was taking down bloodstone-infused Caudecus and ending a massive civil war. It was also all us fighting off the Shadow of the Dragon when it attacked the World Summit, thus it was the Commander who got the spotlight for saving five racial leaders. And as I said, though it resulted in devastation because people didn't listen to us, the Commander and proto-Dragon's Watch had all the proof that could have prevented the devastation. Which kind of shows that we should be listened to.
---
The Commander's reputation wasn't just a case of solely following commands.
---
But I get your point. This is the first *Elder Dragon* where we took the spotlight. And we consequentially failed.
---
The real question is...does it count for Shiverpeaks dailies?
---
Just tested, and you're correct. This makes it even odder as it seems that they chose to remove the reward element from it.
---
I wanted to add something to this, but all I can say is that I agree. I have had the same experience.
---
I'm in the same boat. I played the hell out of GW1. I started playing shortly after Prophecies dropped, bought Factions on release, bought Nightfall on release, bought Eye of the North on release. I sunk many hours into the game and loved every minute of it. When GW2 released, I played the hell out of it, beat Zhaitan, and then promptly dropped it until LS2 started. Everything that happened in LS1, all the new characters introduced? Had no idea who they were and was stuck looking at a wiki and watching Youtube videos to catch up. Since then, I've played on and off, logging on occasionally to unlock LS episodes, and I went through all of HoT, but the game didn't manage to hold my attention the way GW1 did for years.
---
Seems a little busy to me, but still a nice shot nonetheless. 👍 
---
could you imagine we bleed fire shooting out its 6 projectiles all getting reflected by feedback on a single/stack of mobs, poof ded. More ded if the shots pierce, and the burning stacks but im not sure on that front.
---
I got sold because of this video. It was from "Meh another game from NCSoft" (it was soon after Aion fail) to "omg I wanna play it right now!":-)
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBC_ig73aMs
---
Thanks. The sky in there is a bit hectic
---
I just did this mission with friends and decided to get crushed by kralk when he falls on the poor ballista operators for reasons. You glitch into his body get a message about flying to close then when i flew (inside his body) to his mouth after a bit he ate me. Good time 10/10 would do again.
---
At launch vs now.
---
You're speaking (down, btw; didn't miss that) now/a significant period of time after which the game was out.
---
There were no fractals. There were no raids. Dungeon were speed cleared by breaking them (literally) and DPSing with berserker gear. We weren't told "you'll only wear one set of gear because there's only damage". We were told, "We're reenvisioning the trinity. Every class will be able to perform every function." Which was correct, in a way. Every class can heal. Every class can provide defensive bonuses. There were no healers. There were no tanks. That was my greatest disappointment. 
---
Taimi. When tiami calls out just before we round the corner thats what got me, everything else didnt get strong reaction from me.
---
Awwwwwww! Thank you so much!
---
If you’re going chronologically it would be:
---
Season 2
---
Heart of Thorns
---
Season 3
---
Path of Fire
---
Season 4
---
Path of Fire offers the basic raptor just for finishing the first story mission, which is super useful. When I came back about a year ago I got my raptor, then played everything in order. If I got bored I’d run to the desert and work on my mounts and masteries (but didn’t start the story until after Season 3). 
---
Expectations matched:
---
- pretty game
---
- great multiplayer/coop party system
---
- story is more polished than other MMOs at the time of launch (next to FF)
---
- interesting minigames introduced
---
- wardrobe update was mind blowing, next to nothing
---
- weapon skills are limiting but it made the gameplay simpler, rather than just autoattack
---
----
---
Expectations that didn't meet:
---
- time vs. money: rewarding feeling hit and miss
---
- really hard to trade items and shit: workable but rudimentary at best
---
- skill combo needs a revamp
---
- particle effect cluster fuck from skills
---
- "30%" is underwater, well that promise is ditched. Not to mention underwater skills, enough said
---
- needs more emotes
---
- moreso at launch, skills were too few..
---
You can survive without them in non-competitive content (by competitive I mean fractals and such) but I recommend learning them before treading into such places.
---
I didn't say i want to. I wrote: If you want you can not. And not being free to move is not what i was expecting. Maybe in the next, last episode.
---
But i don't really expect to meet and fight Kralkatorrik very soon again. I suppose next episode will be more like. "Oh Glint please, give us a clue. Did you know that ? +more talkings and few more talkings." And that will be perfect this way.
---
ill give that a try then!
---
Don't forget that the radius application of quickness on FB requires a lot of stacking, good luck with those who previously avoided their chronosis wells
---
Except GRRM is a shit writer.  The only redeeming quality of those books is that HBO took over and ended up doing a better job.
---
Stabbing badly written Trahearne was the best part of the game for me.
---
Marauder's stats are alright ele. I run them on my weaver cause I'm bad at weaver. Still can kill things, just maybe a little slower than other better players. 
---
But, don't you think that to much twists can be annoying ?
---
 /stuck
---
I got it too. Thankfully I escaped using bunny, took a while though!
---
Dodging doesn't exist in this game so you don't have those.
---
For clutches you will quickly have them once stuff starts going south which is not depicted in the guide video since well, it's a guide video. For example your tank misses something and dies, now dps players get one shotted left and right until the healer manages to get the cast of the revive skill of, which has 8 seconds cast time. After and if the tank is rezzed the healer now needs to heal the tank while reviving the dead dps with the same skill.
---
Or, your healer dies at 10% and the dps now has to race through tge fight before the tank dies.
---
It's just a different kind of clutches you will face.
---
They're going to have a fight in the mists with the commander, his death will be enough magical energy for someone to come back. Said person will be Aurene, by Glint's choosing, since she has a champion.
---
Better yet, the commander has to plunge into the mists and without a mistwalker like Balthazar they have no way back either and Glint makes one final sacrifice to bring the commander back with Aurene by being the magical energy needed to bring him back too. Hence her vision coming true that she can't see past her fight with Kralkatorrik... Only it wasn't the fight she thought.
---
With Arkk in 100cm, one thing definitely causes it is by starting the fight and then immediately /gg'ing before Arkk fully loads in. I've found that staying up a few seconds and letting the first Blinding Radiance attack go off before doing my /gg prevents it from happening.
---
That said, there are definitely other causes to it, since I've seen Arkk vanish midway through the fight, usually right after killing the adds from the 50% phase.
---
Worse, at least for me, is both times I've run Siren's Reef on T4, I've had every enemy vanish during the final set of fights. Since, unlike Arkk, they move around, I've been stuck just swinging at air for most of these fights.
---
This would actually be fucking awesome. Imagine if the commander slowly becomes more insane, looking into forbidden rituals and ways to reanimate the dead, and everyone who would try to stop us would become boss battles, including our closest friends.
---
This would also be the best way to redeem Braham. He lost his mother, and when she came back in episode four he was desperate to have a little more time with her. He understands better than anyone we know now that the dead have to stay dead, and the best way to continue is to live their legacy.
---
 2 is larger than 3 and 4!
---
 I haven't noticed before!  
---
Nice rhymes! I wish you continued them x) 
---
Me: "WOW, in Gw2 you'll be able to JUMP omagad!"
---
Anet: *adds jumping puzzle *
---
I'm not in a Position for doing this, by far not.
---
I found it interesting at least and wanted to share my thoughts but it seems like I should not.
---
As I wrote I know people have hoarded it and still, I thought this might happen. But we will see in 2 months I guess.
---
My Taco's drawn lines don't stick to their proper path on the ground, they rotate with my screen instead of adhering to the actual path. Happen to anyone else? I play with action cam, 1440p, windowed borderless.
---
I somehow always forget about caithe even when she's like a third of the story
---
Similar to what /u/Fortifa was saying, when Debs later joins the Vigil, you meet her in Orr and she calls you by your full character name, which is weird for a sibling to do.
---
&gt;I didn't say i want to. I wrote: If you want you can not.
---
So you want to move more? You don't want to move more? I think you're being downvoted because people don't know what you are trying to say. 
---
You know what? I think we can all agree that movement is not even a real problem. I think it's just that the story is paced so fast, and it's not to your liking. I understand why you might think so, but it's better (in my opinion) to have a story too fast than too slow, especially when waiting 2-3 months between parts.
---
Most people ~~in GW2~~ cannot read. Same for every single situation in life, not just this game. Ask anyone who works in customer support.
---
What I think special is the fact that this time it's for 2 Slots that are actually still needed for the qol upgrade. Weapons are done Long ago for this Purpose, as everyone that is making it purely for qol will go for gen1 weps anyway. With the trinkets there is no other choice though.
---
If you think that's bad, consider the cultural appropriation of our classical Greek language by Thomas Willis, yet another colonial white male oppressor, who without any consent - in the typical English imperial way - stole the word for honey/sweet, our language, and turned it into a disease. 
---
You are just as complicit in this theft of identity by not recognizing the origins of the word and the continued violation of the people the word was stolen from. Cultural appropriation is not right and it shows a very privileged way of thinking by assuming the appropriated use of the word as the true definition. 
---
You could of course make reparations for this offense and donate some gems or gold, I'll pm you my details.
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?

Due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator+subreddit%3Aguildwars2&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). If you think your thread should be allowed to stay or if this was a mistake do report this comment or send a modmail and Pact commander will come take a look.
---
This spoiler tag did not work as you intended it too. Also, this specific scene does not show anything we did not already know - &gt;!That Kralk had absorbed the magical aspects and energies of Zaithan, Mordremoth and Balthazar. That WAS one of the core discoveries during LS 3 already and got confirmed in case of Zaithan with the Death Branded Shatterer!&lt;
---
This damn thing was responsible for me failing one of the achievements. Was cool flying down that hill on the griffon though 
---
I hope this is the direction we're headed towards! The buildup for our Commander's potential downfall is great- we're known in-universe as Tyria's Superman celeb, but no one knew how our killing of elder dragons has Tyria nearly on the verge of destruction. We're seen as a hero, but Joko (and some Anet devs iirc) calls us out for being the 'villain' instead. Now, in the battle that involved nearly every faction in Tyria, we've not only lost a good portion of our army, but also the key to Tyria's dragon problem.
---
I also love a good hero &gt; accidental villain story trope, but that's just me.
---
I've been testing out the [Mount Radial Menu](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8udnw7/mount_radial_menu_aka_gw2mounts_addon_updated/) and you can bind any keys you want to its six slots.  Not perfect, but maybe a good solution to your problem.
---
It is also open-source so you could modify the art if you are savvy.
---
Also, here is my current [controller config](https://imgur.com/a/zAmIE) for GW2.
---
Someone saying it was heartbreaking was enough for me to piece it together. :/
---
I played the whole story as a sylvari with my husband who plays human. Mordremoth spoke to me and he never heard it. There are a ton of really awesome touches for playing with a non-sylvari friend and I highly recommend taking someone to the final instance with you. 
---
Ohhhhh... I thought you meant the quality of the content. My bad!

Now that holding off on the TacO markers has been suggested, maybe this is a good point for me to piggyback on this comment to suggest giving Blish the ability to run TacO for you (once you've pointed Blish at it) so that you only need to open one utility manually instead of two.
---
pvp didn't seem that good when I tried it for a few days (EU). Lot of afk players and the matchmaking is bad (makes sense due to the low player count), I'm pretty sure there were a couple of mirage bots in my matches too.
---
I'm looking to see if wvw will be any good, otherwise I'll probably leave gw2 for now.
---
Someone enjoying personal story... Color me shocked... Just wait till you hit s3

Green?

It’s monday morning and this is the first thing I read. I‘m not ready for this week if it starts with bullshit.
---
Pinata choya with choya balloons is ultimate content!  
---
(Also! One of these things is not like the other!)
---
Thank you!
---
I try to "promote" my videos here on reddit from time to time, but I don't want to do that to much. As I know people don't really like that ( me included actually :p)
---
I almost missed that dialogue :D
---
you might not like it but this is what peak performance looks like
---
I like how you're implying that you aren't the leecher. DPS means fuck-all if you're not doing mechanics.
---
Between Cliffside, Shattered Observatory, Urban, Volcanic, and Mai Trin  (all fractals with mandatory "someone needs to stop dps right about now" mechanics), it should be pretty clear that dps isn't exactly important.
---
&gt;August '09
---
eh, close enough
---
I was most hyped about the more free movement, jumping, dodging etc. and the reworked skill system, as GW1 had too many useless skills (just like any TCG has also some useless cards) I expected abit longer story (and more paths) than it actually turned out (in the base game)
---
with all the add-ons and living story chapters, it is longer (but more linear) than I ever expected.  
---
As I recently played through "Stories: Path of Destenies" I can see how complex and huge multiple paths can be.
---
I never epxected mounts to be be implemented and to feel that good and distinct.
---
&gt; What are benefits to running the Discipline version
---
A shitload more target and cleave DPS.
---
&gt;When do you use that trait line?
---
Depending on the boss, how well you can play the Discipline rota and how you good your group is, probably everywhere you would play condi banner. If you have OK DPS players and an average execution of the rotation then Tactics will be better on VG because you will give EA to your power classes. Tactics is also recommended if you have to do a canon on Sabetha. I guess that if you don't have the gear for Core Warrior you should also play Tactics where you would play Core.
---
&gt;Did that change with the Sigil/Rune update, or did Berserker get some buffs and doesn't need the extra condi duration anymore?
---
The build changed once after the Rune/Sigil patch (you had different gear for Tactic and Discipline build, yay) and another time when a trait was changed (that's the one that made you drop Malice). The Sigil update mostly made Sigil of Doom and Sigil of Earth way more interesting to play now (more damage out of Doom than before and 100% chance of bleed when you crit on a 2sec CD)
---
[Blademaster](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blademaster) was changed in December an instead of granting base condi duration for Sword skills it now grants a flat 120 Expertise (8% condi duration). Add a few more Expertise infusions than before and now you don't need Malice anymore.
---
Re: Your update, it appears fine on all UI sizes for me; do you use DPI Scaling on top of that? What's your screen resolution?
---
Cannot agree, that was more emotion manipulating imho. Make players adore the character. Kill that character when player thinks that they are going to win, kill in a most shocking way to make it clear that the character is dead, profit.
---
&gt; think it'll just be you, braham, caithe, and Veteran Sergei
---
FTFY. As long Sergei appeared, he should replace her.
---
I would like too see new elite specs aswell,
---
But atleast for now the LWE’s are great.
---
All or nothing has re-sparked my love for this game hard.
---
Took a break for a while.
---
&gt; I highly recommend taking someone to the final instance with you.
---
I second that, super immersive gameplay.
---
For leveling honestly just pick two of the bear types and let them tank while you do damage from range. Pet choice doesn't really matter much in terms of open world and general pve content so pick whatever you like the look of, or do the two bears I suggested. The cat types are also fine if you prefer your pets to be doing more damage.
---
Now once you want to start doing the more difficult content e.g. fractals, raids, spvp, WvW that's when pet choices actually matter.
---
I agree completely, it would be amazing to see that kind of story in an MMO!   
---
Altho it makes me shudder because it also could be the end of GW2 and our dear commander :(
---
i just salvage everything, if you do enough fractals you tend to get a lot of free ascended salvage tools.
---
&gt; Yes the Sword was an important one too but the hammer at the same time wasn't very interesting.
---
Interesting or not is irrelevant to my point.  LS3E6 was Anet releasing multiple legendaries at the same time.  2 weapons and a trinket.  That was the extent of my point.
---
Wow, I'm running AC nearly daily. So I guess I'm just very unlucky then.
---
I bought the game on release and picked my main from GW1, the Necro. I was so excited to play. I looked at all the skills I could get, and that's when I saw HIM. The Flesh Golem. The most badass minion in all of GW1. I eagerly awaited hitting the level required to unlock it, grinding out that last sliver of a level in anticipation.... Only to be let down... The hulking mass of flesh and bone, now a shadow of It's former self. The basic minions in GW1 were more intimidating than this new Golem.  Everything about the Necro was a disappointment to me. I loved Minion Master builds and all the new minions and mechanics were bland to me. No longer can you summon multiple Horrors, they hit like wet noodles, and had textures that made the GW1 minions look amazing. So I stopped playing. Tried a few other classes, but nothing stuck with me. I PvP occasionally now as Reaper is fun, but That's about it. 
---
Elementalist is a good class to start. All the classes in GW2 has a high skill ceiling, but elementalist and warrior probably has the lowest skill floor. Even if you just button mash randomly, you would still do alright as an elementalist (I button mash semi-randomly as an elementalist in sPvP and still somehow manage a 50% overall win rating).
---
For single player and exploring content, all classes are viable. The only place where you might have difficulty is if you on on the HoT maps during quiet periods. Assuming you don't use a level 80 boost on your ele and instead levels normally, learning about the class along the way. You should be fine in the HoT zones by the time you hit 80.
---
Unfortunately not. On the plus side, make sure you pick that sigil of nullification at level 64 for some easy gold.
---
Not that I know of. But you can make the experience more tolerable by clicking Enter after the popup instead of clicking it with mouse (unless you need to pick a reward). i.e. mouse cursor on diamond, left hand on enter. 
---
There have been no changes. Everything continues to get worse as more and more people quit. 
---
Personally I called it! I knew it was going to happen, so I was not surprised that much.
---
So I guess I'm playing the game like any other days.
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature. 
---
&gt;I can not remember, I think it was balance, it was the LONGEST MMO to level in, Korean grind on meth type long.
---
Gonna have to disagree on this. Even back during release you could get to level 80 in just under 7 hours of dedicated/organized exp farming. You get exp from everything, one guy even got to max level in a couple days purely from gathering i believe either lettuces or cabbages, he didn't kill a single thing and wanted to try a pacifist playstyle.  
---
Now with boosters etc its even faster. Without the use of tomes/scrolls but with the use of boosters, the fastest I've taken a character from 1 to 80 is just under 4 hours. And for long term players, scrolls and tomes makes it take a couple minutes at most. If you still have access to your original account and a character from all the way back to launch, you likely have some birthday presents waiting with one of them giving you a level 60 scroll.  
---
If you're starting fresh on an F2P account and you focus on leveling with no boosters etc, then the numbers are still about the same, around about 7 hours. Of course this figure will increase if you simply play the game and enjoy the exploration rather than focus on leveling, which tbh is how I would do it, ignore the level cap and just go do stuff.
---
Didn't want to touch on episode 4 just yet cause it was too early for spoilers, but I'm getting into it soon!
---
Sad  :(
---
Some people are speculating we'll get new elite specs with season 4 or 5, but i think we gotta be realistic. Some really cool shit might come with a LS release, but elite specs arnt one of them (imo at least). They would have to release 9 new modifications to classes all at one time and then balance around it in the coming months.
---
Think of it this way: if we gotta wait a year or so for more elite specs, theyll be even better than the PoF ones, which were (once again imo) more fun than the HoT ones for the most part. (Please give me my dual pistol warrior Anet)
---
No idea why people are flipping their shit on that post. Thanks for letting us know, and thanks for your help.
---
if you still get it at least once a week, it has not been fixed yet.
---
i actually used to play WvW a lot until i found out spvp is where the real pvp is.
---
if you come to spvp  you have to play by it rule. if you are fighting far from node with no reason. you are in the wrong game mode. 
---
the same thing could be applied to WvW  although it's less irrelevant depending on people. 
---
\*Does the problem persist?\*
---
No, but…
---
\*Good!\*
---
Final boss was indeed a tough one to learn in T4. We finally made it by switching my Diviner Renegade for another Scourge (final Setup was Firebrand + Power Banner + Dragonhunter + 2x Scourge) and focussed on killing the ads. 
---
1st priority was killing the quartermaster as he gives boons to all the other adds with the lightning bolt casting veterans a close second. We used Poison Cloud and Epidemic and also rather quickly found you need to share the green shark field. Finally, the orange fields on the ship are using a fixed pattern so you can avoid getting pushed out quite a bit.
---
I would argue PvE IS the reason to buy the expansion. PvP and WvW really only profit from the elite specs. Not the new maps, the story the masteries like gliding and mounts. All the works
---
they had a much more elegant feel in gw1. 
---
You have to be using and AXE for that achievement to register AND you have to do it in Thinderhead Peaks. I tried to do it with my guardian on greatsword and nothing. Then on my warrior who used axe but in Queensdale. Finally I went to the new map used my axe on neutral mobs (stags and deer south of The Weepong Sisters poi) and got it.
---
Simple question have simple answers

are you interested in druid healing? Those are almost always welcome. Other than that viper scourge is pretty easy to run, but I don't know if those are wanted in raids(I don't raid). Viper Soulbeast is also viable in both raids and fractals. You won't be the best dps, but you will be consistently good dps and it's super easy to run.
---
obviously, earth elementals bleed sand.
---
Heals you receive, so heals that for example a druid would give you, are increased by 20%.
---
Seems like the only logical way.
---
Id assume they would remain how they are and maybe the season 1 story versions use the fractal updated versions of the missions played out slightly differently. And as fractals continue they could still use season 1 stuff. If we can see Braham and Rox, wouldnt it make sense to see the commander? And the commander seen could be a model chosen at random from the people in the fractal, that would be cool.
---
They won't add them as outfit because there are 10 different FoW armors. Times 2 (male/female) = 20 armors
---
Now you have 5 different races in gw2. Norn/Sylv/Human armors are almost identical but charr and asura are not. So you also have to design armors for those races. I don't think they'll put so much effort in that
---
I have Dungeoneer since a few months ago and those are the 3 only recipes I have ever got though
---
Also don't worry I get unlucky in other places of the game to balance thinks out :p
---
When you have nothing else to do, so you gotta overthink and get triggered ‘cause of the name of a videogame NPC...Whats next ?
---
full zerker warrior can work in WvW assuming you have the skill and the ping to play full glass. Some of the best warrior roamers around run full zerker or full marauder as their default, but usually have spare cavaliers or knights etc for specific situations. But if your ping is high or you don't have the skill, then yes, it will not work, you will absolutely die all the time.
---
I just wish they found a way to make content that's been left behind still relevant.
---
I'll be honest I havnt played for a while but when I do I'm always disappointed by how dungeons like CoF are pointless now. 
---
I know the usual argument for this is that we have fractals now, but if its true that fractals is the replacement then why not merge them somehow.
---
My point is new content is great, but with a little reinvention old unused content could become like new.
---
it's a weekend, as with most things, it's slower over the weekend because most people are not working.
---
I'd settle for new skills and (unlikely) a new weapon for each core profession. 
---
&gt;The deluge of adds is the entire point of the fight.  Remove them and it'll just be another cut and paste boss fight.
---
And how is that the players fault?  
---
Maybe ANet should bother to create unique Fractal-Bosses again instead of copy-pasting them and scaling the difficulty by simply adding a variety of AoEs and Adds.
---
Out of my group that sparsely joins fractals I’m the only one that isn’t affected by this. I seriously don’t know what I’m doing different. However it’s hella annoying to suddenly need to announce enemy spawns or positions non stop lol 
---
It may just need to update as the last significant game update was only a week ago. 
---
To be fair he's not **completely** wrong, just misguided. As there are totally times even in GW2 where you just stand there and cast skills - during any dps phase, for example.
---
Also for most people in any raid scenario in any game, you're just going to be "standing there casting skills" in the sense that the only thing you're really doing aside from that is trying to "not stand in the fire."
---
Take bastion of the penitent for example. For Cairn almost everyone is just "Standing there casting abilities" for most of the fight, just stepping out of the stack if they get shared agony, dodging the dick spin and moving to green circles to avoid damage. 
---
Then MO you just "stand there casting abilities" if you're not one of the three people with claim/dispel/protect, just following the tank around when you're forced to move.
---
Same thing with Sammy, you just stand there and smack him, with most people only concerning themselves with jumping shock waves and cc'ing during his pounce. If you're not on Rigom duty this doesn't even change during that phase, except maybe you have to clear out some spears.
---
For most of the raid group in any MMO you're just trying to avoid standing in hurtful things, running to designated spots at specific times, and maybe cc'ing/cleaving. Generally only a small part of the raid has to deal with stuff like destroying cannons on sabetha or turning into a slubling for sloth.
---
Imagine a longer-lasting reflect, causing the projectiles to cause damage, leading to more bleeding, leading to more projectiles, which are again reflected ...
---
Oh yeah you are right I forgot the fact we have 5 races :(
---
Anyway I d love to get my monk armor back :(
---
If you do the two meta's or buy the Light of Deldrimor Plate on the TP you have a 50% chance to get access to that room by completing the plate puzzle.
---
Still, it is odd that they removed the need to get the plate for the final chest room and not the purple room below.
---
Also imagine a flesh ripping bloody charr in a mesmer obsidian armor. Eh.
---
I for one welcome our new robot overlords
---
Anet and punlisher are genius at their job. They hyped GW2 fans and casuals and WOW players alike. Delivered just for casuals but got money from all of above. 10 years and no build templates and Guild vs Guild and 3 guild halls in game that has GUILD WARS in name. No real dragons just abominations in spam 1 skill cutscene fights in gsme thst has a DRAGON in logo. Haha they flipped us hard. When I abadon my GW1 legacy and look at GW2 as in any other game it holds strong in casual mmo market with usual shit this days like overpriced shop items.
---
I have played about 2 months at max now. What I did was: 
---
\-Played f2p about 1 month and leveled my guardian by doing hearts and events
---
\-Bought both expansions but still leveled up normally my guardian till 80 and bought cheap exotic berserker set from TP and weapons etc.
---
\-Played first chapter of POF to get that mount
---
\-Got bored with guardian and started to level up ranger
---
\-Leveled up to 30-40 normally with hearts and events to understand my class properly
---
\-Used boost to 80 and now I have exotic cheap condi set and also power sets for my ranger. 
---
\-Now I am maining my ranger and doing stories and 100% map completions in Tyria.
---
One of the recs yesterday (i dont remember which one) had Stick Together and SA. It's not that bad, because the range of SA is like 100, while Stick Together is 300.
---
I thought that's called thief and "interesting gameplay"...
---
Then you'd understand the goal of objectives -the doors- is to generate interaction between two enemy groups. 
---
And to be honest it worked quite well like this with a larger and healthier population and considerably less overpowered defense (limited supply, objectives taking longer and more effort to upgrade, no tactivators, no gliding straight into upgraded objectives, ...) 
---
The reason nobody in WvW still /cares/ about the objectives themselves? Because anet refuses to balance them for \~6 years now, but is entirely OK with adding "fluff" that sounds fun but makes the game mechanics progressively worse. 
---
Imagine how quickly PvP dies the moment half the players AFK when they're not granted free wins and actually have to fight other players for their win \*gasp\* the horror! Oh wait you don't have to imagine... 
---
Okay awesome I'll check that spot on, thank you so much and thanks for the info! I've been using my axes and in Thunderhead, but no luck yet. When they say 10% or less within 5 minutes, am I allowed to go down at all within that or must this all be done within the 10% or less? If that makes sense.. I didn't know if I couldn't go down then get back up and get my health down again.. 
---
Or if I could kill, say 3 things, then if I need 2 more and if my health shoots back up does it reset? 
---
You can buy the Light of Deldrimor plates on the TP (either half or the complete key) you do not have to do the meta. 
---
I agree the poi should not be locked in this way, though. And Anet seem to agree, given the fix for the green room.
---
You did real good :D
---
Sorry WvW and PvP no longer fit in anet's vision to make GW2 great again. This is now a casual game for friendly players where competition and performance are both seen as inherently toxic.
---
If we would have gotten a new expansion straight after LWS4 they wouldn't have had enough time to actually make one. By giving us two seasons they gave themselves three years.
---
Assuming 3months per episode and 6 episodes each season. I'm not sure if people will be okay with that long only living world, but they said their gonna ramp up what we get on it. 
---
I personally love what they're doing with LW but I think they need more Teams working on it so the quantity of content gets bigger without sacrificing quality. 
---
Also a good thing: They had roughly one year for HoT, about two years for PoF, imagine how great of an expansion we could get with three years worth of development time (plus more experienced team, better tools etc etc) 
---
Thank you for the info!!! I had someone else mention this spot, just no luck there yet and I even killed 6 spiders so I was like what am I missing? I'm still trying though since that is the perfect spot for it. I'll switch over and see what my necro can do! Did you have to kill all 5 without going down? I know there is a 5 minute window which lead me to think I could go down, get back up and drop my health then continue on. But I doubt that. I assume 5 at 10% or less before dying or not dying at all lol. 
---
You might be interested in the Xbox adaptive controller Microsoft made it last year to help people with disabilities
---
Oh ok, I did it like 3 times in a row yesterday, but it might definitly be that the drop rate is still not 100% when solo..
---
what you could try, go to WvW or GH or sPvP lobby and then leave. See if you pop up in the exact same stuck place or if that fixes it. It has fixed it for me before.
---
Hearts usually walk you through a zone, giving you a feel for what's going on. They're flavour as much as anything else. 
---
Events are sort of like quests in other games. Some event chains will take you over a whole map (although most are just one or two areas). Almost all of them contribute to a heath quest, so if you see an event, hop into it. 
---
Hearts usually move you around in a rough arc by the level of the mobs there, so they're a tool to keep you active as well.
---
POIs, vistas and waypoints grant a chunk of exp. Don't forget to explore the six cities as well, that's a non-ignorable amount of exp. 
---
Dungeons give you a whole level, I think. Crafting a skill to 500 takes you up about 12 levels but that gets expensive quickly so is more practical on a second character (to 400 takes you up about 8.5 levels. 400-500 is usually about at as expensive to 1-400 unless you have enormous ectoplasm stockpiles).
---
i don't know about nowadays but back like 4 years ago
---
it became less irrelevant because of players themself.
---
" we are gvg guild , we are just here to fight , we don't care ppt , we aren't ppt hero " 
---
also the other big issue is wvw being opened 24/7. 
---
Yes sorry lol
---
the main issue with this bug is that it's not consistently repeatable. For me personally there was an entire week where every single fractal this happens, sometimes the floor disappears too. But I haven't personally encountered it in the past two weeks.
---
As somebody who works in IT, I know that if they can't replicate it reliably, it would be impossible to fix because they can't just randomly make changes since they might break other things. Unfortunately until someone figures out how to trigger it consistently, it will likely remain unfixed. A competent development manager wouldn't allow a dev to spend too much time on something like this when prioritizing work items/tickets, because that's just throwing your resources down the drain.
---
why make a completely new system so you can sell skins to individual classes when you can just make skins for multiple classes?
---
i'd rather not they waste their effort on it
---
I imagine because different people added those items to the game, and sometimes somebody forgets to add that text.
---
Revenant also has projectile disruption and condi clear in Ventari. Tome of Courage 3 on Firebrand. Thief has Smoke Screen. Necro has Corrosive Poison Cloud. Whirling Defence on Ranger. All these destroy/reflect projectiles. (Does stability prevent getting blown off? If so then taking skills that give stability should be a given, i.e. Stand Your Ground and Dolyak Stance, yes I am aware that in a 3dps comp that means the Soulbeast has to drop frost spirit but people getting blown off is probably even more of a DPS loss, also Dolyak stance handily reduces damage taken from conditions, combine that with the Kalla heal skill and you will probably be able to shrug conditions off like they're nothing). It's a condi class and I know it's not really optimal for most fractals but Scourge itself would do extremely well here as well between epidemic, barrier, CPC, and its condi clear + conversion.
---
But nah, let's stubbornly stick to meta 100% exactly, even if guides on the same sites that gave us the meta builds recommend to switch skills. Let's also mock people who dare to change builds away from the meta, because clearly they're obviously bad players who need to be carried by their utilities, right?
---
&gt;This is exactly the point I was making. Class/Profession knowledge has tanked since Chrono/Druid became a thing
---
This is also frustrating because it means there are also far less guides on how to use anything that isn't either of them when it comes to support. 
---
Um no you don't just move and then stand there to attack. For cairn you actually need to kite around the blue circles on the ground and do your class dps rotation. Same with alot of other bosses unless its during stun phases where you literally just stand there and attack. Anet need to ramp up boss attack speeds so people are forced to attack and kite at a faster pace. Fractals T4s and CMs wins over  raids in this respect.
---
Yes all MMOs need you to avoid standing in hurtful things, but only gw2 let you cast skills while kiting. which opens up to alot of possibilities. Add to this teleports some times also as stun breaks makes some harder fights alot higher skill tiered.
---
Alot of players will be happy if their teams clear content as a group effort. But there is a much higher level of play in gw2 that is not found in other games. Not all players will make the effort to attain it but its there if you want to seek it. 
---
SA and Slippery Slope was on one of them yesterday. It was both hilarious and frustrating. My group struggled just to try and get into the rooms and then the mining... And if you fall into the lava area, it's a real pain to try and get back up.
---
PM me your in game name and I can get you started on some builds for a few of the classes you have.
---
I think of the commander as a minor celebrity, much like Geralt in the Witcher series. Lots of people know who s/he is, but not really what to do with him/her. 
---
This person came from *nowhere*, worked up the ranks at lightning speed then, with help, killed a dragon, killed *another* dragon, killed a corrupt politician, killed a *god* then killed an immortal god-king and destabilised an entire nation. S/he is friends with a dragon, allied with *at least* the queen of Kryta and the Pale Tree and several other heads of state. 
---
In LW S3E1, the Vigil try to give him/her a desk job... they don't know what to do with him/her but want to keep an eye on him/her.
---
If the Commander asks for help, you send a small detachment. Not a large one, just enough to show willing, but you send something. 
---
I think/hope the commander has some serious fallout for this. I was to see the Commander screwed and fighting for redemption.
---
uh, this might be interesting for you: there is an EU GvG discord
---
[discord.gg/uyuPxCN](https://discord.gg/uyuPxCN)
---
and a spreadsheet with all EU GvG guilds [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XJdNIynuN4xcOhl0g5dxDjP8xED6k9MIyqukpJMU5XE/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XJdNIynuN4xcOhl0g5dxDjP8xED6k9MIyqukpJMU5XE/edit#gid=0)
---
feel free to ask further questions
---
Is it just by killing things on the map? And is there any prerequisites in starting the living story maps or gear I need?
---
If backpacks technicaly count as weapons, why can't we stat swap them?
---
The guild bounty NPC hunting is for killing specific enemies in POF?
---
Some living story’s require to be bought by gems, at the cost of 200 each story, but the new ones are free for a certain time, isle of Istan farm is really good for gold, you should check that out, and you don’t really need good gear for it as there is a group of like 40 people doing it 
---
that's not how p2w works
---
Could you explain isle of Istan for me? I’ve only ever done silverwaste. Been 3 years since I’ve played aha
---
I heard about in 2012-2013 too but I started playing it until end 2017 
---
do events and hearts (some events give better loot then others). certain maps require you to get to a certain point in an episode or have a portal scroll.
---
Look at a guide on YouTube, I forgot who made one but it’s a really good guide that explains the whole meta :) it can be a lot to explain on here :p
---
Usually you farm the new currency then salvage  it for the magic and use that to buy the bags and sell the materials u get 
---
It happened to my party yesterday in t4 sirens landing on final boss, can confirm that we also had an elementalist. We fixed it by letting one person stay in instance and restarting our games.
---
It'd be good for us, but I think that having new earning opportunity for anet would be nice. I didn't mention in the post, but the intention for this post was suggesting new market for anet. 
---
Anyway, it'd be funny to see all the asurans having golems on their tails.
---
The two metas drop the two halves of the Light of Deldrimor that starts the puzzle. You should very much have the Consul's Tomb after doing the story (It takes you into it when you do the mold and oil part of the story).
---
The other one (north or Consul's Tomb) is Hammer's hoard, and used to require the puzzle, but has since been changed to allow you to rub your face on the bars to see inside and get the Point of Interest without having to go inside.
---
Bravo on this masterpiece of sardonic humor.  Too bad more people don't appreciate it.  
---
Nah, for guild mission bounties, like Poodoo.
---
Oh true that looks quite similar, I totally forgot about them !
---
Mostly doing certain Events or killing mobs (or doing Events that spawn a lot of mobs :P)
---
Best example might be Istan:
---
The most lucrative Events here are Palawadan and Great Hall. Both spawn a lot of Champions that drop certain Loot bags which contain unidentified gear, which again can be either opened or sold on the TP. (selling is better unless you have like 600+ magic find) A nice addition to that is the volatile magic you will gain. This is used to buy Shipments for different mats (trophy is the most lucrative afaik).
---
This. The lack of HoH, GvG etc eventually drove me away a year or so after release. Came back last week (maybe only temporarily) after the current state of World of Warcraft is almost unbearable.
---
Imagine pocket raptors having these kind of devices... nightmare invasion xD
---
no shit
---
that's why i am asking for some news, when we can expect a fix
---
I remember looking at every single official/amateur/conf video that was available on the web with awe. I've played every single Beta with as little sleep possible and was absolutely in love with it. One thing I overestimated was the line they kept on repeating in almost every promo video "dynamic events affecting the world and NPC's remembering you". I thought more of those things as "ok this bridge has been brought down, nobody can move to that specific area without us repairing it". In a way they definitely did that, some areas are not reachable if a specific event failed, but I thought they were going to be more punishable. So in a good way that didn't meet my expectation.  
---
What I loved was the open world concept, completely different from GW1. Some people hate it, I loved it. Having instanced maps was kind of boring after a while, if you had a friend that came online a little bit later, he couldn't join you, etc. etc.  
---
Looking back right now, I mainly play the new LS and a bit of the new maps that come out because lack of time. But GW2 will always be a place where i can just hop into a map, get pulled in in whatever NPC got himself into or enjoy the story. Being able to sustain a community like that for 10 years (GW2) and almost as long for GW1 takes a serious amount of craftmanship. So here's to Anet!  
---
Thanks!
---
True,
---
for me the difference is still that this time the trinket is more expected and people might be prepared. Last time some people had to do time-gated stuff in advance and some were in the middle of doing so. This did spread the need for mats. This time it could be more spiky.
---
I know it most likely won't impact the prices on the long run, if it impacts the prices at all. And that's also the reason why this isn't one of those fishy threads, as 2 months in advance won't do much. If I wanted to do such a thing I would have done it days/hours before release. If it does anything it evens out the problem as some people might buy what they need in the upcoming 2 months instead of at release...
---
That sucks wvw and gvg was so much fun and gw2 got such an awesome combat system and potential for it :(
---
Does anyone know the name of the song piece played in the background of this trailer at the one minute mark?  
---
  
---

---
Note that the AoE is really powerfull, but deactivate the passive. So only do it if either you get revive, either you can kill soon a mob, otherwise you won't be able to leech during his cd.
---
That is stunning! [Obsidian armor btw] (https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Obsidian_armor)
---
Why would you need an extension? You're not happy with the length?
---
I think overall I am fairly disappointed by Guild Wars 2. Which doesn't mean that the game isn't great or enjoyable, but I was expecting some key specific elements before launch based on what we know:
---
* A reimagination of **DAoC's Realm vs Realm combat**. This is the biggest letdown as while WvW can and is fun for breaks and even for a whole day if I don't overdo it, it's a loooong way off from the glory of RvR in DAoC. We lack meaningful material value as distances are short and keeps/towers are taken in minutes, we lack anything like superior grind spots in WvW zones or (even more important) the auto-population-balancer that was *Darkness Falls*, we lack relics (though orbs did a shot, instead of improving them they were just dropped).
---
* Due to the game intentionally shedding many MMO conventions of the post-WoW world and the specific advertisements for this, I was expecting an **organic ongoing story** which **permanently changes the world state**. That is, story would essentially be missable. The story plays out **with or without me**. And what a letdown this one was. We had this, for a while. The implementation was rough to say the least, but the magic did indeed exist. An actually living, breathing, evolving MMORPG world. Wow. My teen dreams back from UO and EQ1, finally fulfilled. Only to be taken away because by and large the community wished for the exact opposite + development is easier if the teams don't have to care about the rest of the game and work in their own little area. Shame really, it was one of the big pillars of GW2.
---
* But on a positive closing note, the game completely fulfilled my expectations for **open world experience** overall and how the classes interact within it. By and large everyone can do everything, gaming is always friendly, it's never a bad thing to see other players around. People are - comparatively speaking - helpful and nice, and readily run over to help out even with events they weren't interested in before they saw someone struggle. Two thumbs up, this is amazing to see in a MMORPG!
---
Yep! You're fine. Don't need to do it all on the same characters :) 
---
It depends, if you're just joining casual pug groups for T4 it should be fine. But for speed clear groups that do CMs + T4s + recs in 1-1.5 hours then it would be frowned upon.
---
if that's your goal i think that anet would've done it by now if it was worth the effort
---
Remember when Glint took Aurene away from us for a brief moment? The old switcheroo!
---
Why do backpacks count as weapons?
---
As good as taco is, I really dislike it's UI navigation...
---
No. It wasnt. maybe you should go back and read arenanet statements on the matter. they were very clear. this alone was not the reason. 
---
There was even a post recently saying you should always have at least 25% boon duration (and that was for CONFIDENT chronos, not the average one, where it was more like 65%) because, you know, mechanics exist and only relying on SoI will just result in no buffs at all eventually. It can't extend buffs that aren't there.

---
As much as I would love to get new elite specs in LW, I don't see how they could do this in an satisfying way for everyone. I mean, releasing 9 new specs for all professions in one LW episode will be a bit out of scope. Not only because this would undermine their business model for LW episodes. They are, after all, completely optional right now. Yes we have the beetle, but this is only 1 mount out of 6. New elite specs have a much deeper impact on the game than a mount could ever have. The same applies to splitting the elite specs across all episodes of one season.
---
Arena Net could do this, if they change the business model from free unlocks to a seasons pass that you need to buy in any case. That way you can make sure, that everyone who bought it will have all elite specs as soon as they release. But most people won't like the idea of LW suddenly locked behind the gemstore.
---
I need to wonder how much more content we would get with each LW episode, if we would need to buy the seasons instead of the current free unlocks. Right now, every new episode is somewhat shallow in content and replay-ability. Would be interesting to see what Arena Net could do with that format if there was a payment wall and seasons pass in place. Just imagine a world where every episode comes with a new fractal, a new raid, new story, new map and the occasional release of new elite specs, but we would need to pay 15 to 20 bucks for it. This would be 18 months of content for a bit less money than an expansion, but with no boarders what the content could include. And Arena Net could connect the story lines across all maps what would result in less features being abandoned (like Suns Refuge).
---
It is per account
---
That's some quality Armor
---
how long until the pvp season starts?
---
The mounts and gliding make a big difference, and maybe once you get going you might enjoy it more. But I wouldn't know. Maybe join a guild and do fractals? After one night doing WvW and fractals I had a pretty good item and a lot of experience.
---
Failure is success in progress ;)
---
This completely misses my point, though. Of course you should adjust your strategy to fit the situation. I didn't mention anything about changing utilities or builds to fit the situation, I was talking about swapping to an entirely different *profession* for one encounter.
---
The context of this post is that healing tempest trivialises the specific encounter that is mentioned in the OP and the implication is that swapping to it can carry groups that are having difficulties with the fight.
---
I'm fully aware that reflects and blinds can work as well, but swapping to heal tempest isn't an accessible alternative. It doesn't share a weight class or weapons with the other two foremost heal/support builds, so you can't share much gear between them if you're expected to swap.
---
I'm saying that bringing heal tempest is a massive ask given its limited usefulness and the level of investment required to make it fractal-ready.
---
I know right. Anet have never done something like this and I'll hate if next episode we acting like the commander again as nothing has happened it makes Aurenes "death" pointless. Let us attack Kralkatorrik head on, we lose heavily and we lose multiple friends like Zojja who I think will be in the next episode. Have a massacre of the factions in the army and use season 5 as a story of gaining trust again. Maybe the pact get so pissed they break the commander for life rule and strip us of that title and in season 5 through a reputation feature (my personal way of doing this) use the reputation system to build up trust with the orders, the pact, the sunspears etc again.
---
I expected a nice twist (or five) of the knife, glad to be disappointed on this wretched Monday.
---
Spaghetti
---
"I don't know".
---
If you had any other chars on your old account, you might want to check their mail. Birthday presents contain a level 20/30/40 or even a 60 boost
---
&gt; This also lets the writers get around the problem of having a split in alliances between Charr and Human players, if all of them are magically obligated to serve Krytan interests, whether they like it or not.
---
No, this would just make Charr players *even more* annoyed they couldn't just get their info from Ash instead of being forced into that stupid oath. Plus in terms of storytelling the supposed magical nature of said oath is a relatively minor point in a largely inconsequential story episode, I'd wager a large portion of PoF returners aren't even aware of it and there's no easy way of reminding them without actually invoking the magic.
---
A much simpler and cleaner solution would be for Charr PCs to respect their chain of command, or at least claim to do so while actually doing Commander things.
---
If I dont drop the purple plate from the graveling I log out into character select and back in. After that I got the plate 3 out of the last 3 tries.
---
No boost needed for a mount. Just ask someone lvl 80 if you could join 1st PoF mission with him
---
They dropped because they were re-released as a potential drop in the halloween black lion chests and a whole bunch got added to the market. 
---
that sounds great. I assumed you wouldn't kill of the feature permanently, but without it LB lost its usefulness temporarily for me, looking forward to 1.9 =)
---
what you're describing is rather ambitious though, hope you can pull it off. maybe consider bringing the old version of this feature back until the new one is closer to ready. it wasn't as flexible as what you're describing, but still good enough for many use cases, especially just running a few programs whenever launching GW2.
---
It's not p2w, it's pay 2 play with a really generous f2p demo period.  
---
Elite specs are usually more useful than core classes, except some specific builds - base warrior for example.
---
Funny how proud they apparently were of their 1080p performance back then.
---
between, vanquishing, elite capturing, side quests, farming and cartographer every zone in gw1 got multiple visits. In gw2 you do the story and if you're lucky it has a meta event. Otherwise the map is dead after a few weeks
---
Some people might not have a choice 
---
Why are you posting discord publicly? 
---
&gt; Happy cake day! 
---
Thanks !
---
I'll ask this evening for the 80 players to help me, I'm sure someone will help me. 
---
Ok i'll follow your tips abvout the items and crafting. 
---
But I was looking for builds, and I really want to do [this one](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Reaper_-_Power_Minion_Master) for PvE. As I understand your comment, it's useless to craft for PvE right ? So I can do this build with a bought GreatSword. 
---
I planned to do artificer anyway but was wondering about other jobs. 
---
Thanks 
---
From my experience nearly all open world group content in PoF requires fast moving/ mass tagging/ using waypoints (e.g. caravans in Istan). I honestly have no time whatsoever to write anything when there's action. I see people start chatting when there's a break. 
---
What? Those gvg players carried whole servers outside of their evening raids
---
&gt; Remember to deposite material to bank. salvage blue&amp;white gear with basic kit, yellow either sell on tp if &gt;17s(/what ever is the current price of globs of ecto) or salvage with master kit if &lt;17s. Green - salvage with master if it has a rune, basic if it doesn't. Sell junk to vendors.
---
Thanks :)
---
Yeah, thats why few of us that remain, play it.
---
I tried to not go down, just in case. Also used the Dragonsblood exotic axe just in case. Shroud is great because it 'freezes' your HP at a certain amount, so you don't get downed.
---
I was so fucking hyped for this game, and i expected a true sequel to the best game i've ever played. 
---
I was most excited about no instanced maps and to see what became of the world in the 250 year time game.
---
Now that we are 10 years later I can honestly say GW2 has been a disappointment for me. losing instanced maps meant losing the very identity of GW1. This compared with focusing on casual gamers and the babypool depth mechanics and build crafting left a bitter taste in my mouth.
---
I still love the world and the lore but i hardly play this game outside of the living world seasons.
---
All of those pretty much where things I did once, and elite capturing happened for the most time while I was there the first time or during one of the others. Side Quests also only brought you there once and usually you rushed through again.
---
GW2 had, at least in the beginning, the world bosses that brought you to some maps again, Guild Bosses where you had to go across them once a week, guild races, a couple of major events happened on the normal events during living story before HoT, you had jumping puzzles if you were so inclined, event's you needed to open dungeons, map completion aswell (which for me was a lot more regular in GW2 than GW1 because of legendaries).
---
While I you don't have a huge population on the maps, whenever I did a map completion for example, I've always map a bunch of players on every map and I kinda liked that.
---
Now the new maps all have some sort of meta event for which people can / do return to them.
---
Gotcha! 
---
Sorry? Haha :). You can "stat swap" backpieces if it's not infused and you infuse it, that will reset it's stats so you can select it again. But it is quite pricey since you need a stack of ectos to do that. Also, you can stat swap legendary backpieces any time for free. Hope that answers your question!
---
Everything is fine as long as its not slippery slope.  
---
But yes they are annoying...  
---
Same here, nothing's ever invisible for me.
---
But when my guildies do fractals with me, they often have mobs and bosses (especially bosses) turn invisible. Some of them do fractal dailes multiple times a week, but only have problems with me around. Problems go away if I'm not in the party...
---
It could be that something on my character (I have a few infusions) or the character itself is the cause. I always do fractals on my ele main, but gonna test this out on an alt next time.
---
I want Aurene as flying mount !
---
Snargle is an absolute riot in these panels. Including his zombie cockroach thingy he's playing with.
---
They did mention elite specs could be released outside of expansions too. I have high hopes :) 
---
For power reaper you can go ahead with weaponsmith! 
---
And no it's not useless to craft in PvE, in fact its needed since you need ascended stuff for fractals, what I meant was it's not recommended to craft items which are not level 80. For example, crafting a level 60 axe would cost you more than buying it off TP or vendor directly. 
---
I'll try to explain a bit better, so there are different classes of weapons and armour, you can notice them by color, like white, blue, green masterwork, yellow rare, orange exotics, and pink ascended. It is recommended that you craft only level 80 exotics or level 80 ascended items. Another thing to mention is that ascended weapons, armour etc are account bound, so you need to craft them and they cannot be bought of TP. For crafting level 80 exotics you need crafting level 400 and for crafting ascended items you need crafting trait level 500.
---
There are guides which tell you exactly what to craft to level up a crafting trait most efficient way to level 400 or level 500 like http://gw2crafts.net 
---
And yes! You can definitely do that build with a bought greatsword. 
---
Except that the oath of the Shining Blade only makes you keep the secrets protected by the oath.  
---
Also, I still giggles thinking that Taimi probably recorded everything and just don't bothered telling us she heard everything.
---
And there's the hypothesis that : the commander died against Balthazar, so the commander is free from the oath from then.
---
I wish for next expansion to NOT be human centered. Most people I know want Cantha as an expansion. I hope for Cantha to come several years later.  
---
Yes, they announced that there will not be an expansion between s4 and s5
---
PvP has a competitive structure. You get teams based on your matchmaking rating (which as long as there is sufficient pop) gives you similar minded players. Plenty of players who don't really play heavy competitive who do just run to mid to fight it out, repeatedly. In fact under \~1700 rating I barely see anyone playing nodes properly. So that's what, 1-2% of the remaining pvp population at best?
---
 WvW had some issues preventing it from being competitive. Issues related to server transfers and coverage issues made it so PPT in itself could never be a healthy "win" mechanism for WvW. At best it could attempt to rank servers of even population (in reality it also fails quite horribly at that). 
---
These issues were pointed out on release. Several years later - it's obvious that anet has no interest in fixing these issues. It's no suprise that many of the competitive players gave up on PPTing as the "only win condition" because it literally doesn't work. It COULD work - but not in the current state of WvW. 
---
These guilds raid on PRIME TIME - which suprisingly is the most IRRELEVANT TIME for PPT. If they want to be competitive in GW2 PPT, they need to quit their jobs and host EOTM style ktrains in the middle of the night and the morning. They'd rather quit the game than do "hardcore" PPT - which is exactly what most people did. 
---
Not because objectives are bad, mind you. But because of how badly balanced these objectives are to generate what the players consider "fun". 
---
So there's a system that doesn't promote competition, but instead ensures healthy competition from coverage / PPT / objectives CAN NEVER HAPPEN. Yet the gameplay itself is fun, and actually decent for competition. Are you suprised after several years you get GvG guilds that rather fight according to their own rules for fun? You shouldn't be. 
---
What is suprising is how anet never realised that despite their system being broken (and this being pointed out repeatedly), to the point where guilds were setting up their own systems entirely for years, they never ever supported this. Keep in mind GvGs those days lured in more twitch viewers than you'll see for anything, ever, nowadays. 
---
And if you actually played - you'd realise these guilds were still a huge benefit to their servers. Because they raid what, 6 to 10 hours a week? Half their players would play twice that. Most (GvG) guilds were also quite involved in their servers' communities, through leads and high activity. 
---
Now that you don't have those guilds or any competitive players, you have PvE pugs training around as long as there are no or very disorganised enemies. As soon as the opposition kills them twice, half of them afk, log off or change map to try somewhere else. 
---
Considering how you're genuinely clueless about Wvw, I suggest you stick to giving advice regarding gamemodes you actually play. 
---
GW1 was a vastly superior game imo. The armour looked amazing, unique and actually felt like an achievement to earn. 
---
Whiskey is the answer
---
For me non competing for map gathering nodes, everyone had a self heal and could combat rez. The living world story and the Dynamic events also kept me coming back. Yup GW2 achieved WoW killer status for me.
---
Beetle is part of the Mounts feature, which is a PoF feature. So it's fine to release new mounts during Living Worlds that are under PoF. Assuming Season 5 also requires PoF purchase to play, if Elite Spec series 3 is tied to Season 5, that would make two series of Elite Specs tied to a PoF purchase which I find highly implausible.
---
The only way that would work is if Season 5 is completely buy-to-play only. We'd buy a pass to get access to Season 5 and series 3 would be tied to the Season 5 pass. Again, I find very unlikely.
---
one by one ?
---
I'm going to be a little bit of a pessimist here: They found out that selling random mount skins is more profitable than making an expansion. They can keep the playerbase somewhat happy with LS episodes that probably cost way less for them to make, while raking in that sweet micro transaction money. It might even be a requirement by ncsoft at this point, who knows.
---
It been a bug in WvW for years. It starts with you not being able to see npc or your weapons. Follows up with you being invisible, moving to having issues to load when wp in WvW and can take up to 5 min before you loaded in. And in the end you are not able to jump and at that point you have to relog. Which is fun to do on reset with 60 people in queue on the border you have to leave. I mean this is game breaking but yet years after it was first reported it is still there. Your problem is in PvE though so might not have to wait that long :)
---
Well said.
---
Reflects, Blinds, Stability, Spb Bubble.  You have options.  If you choose not to use them that's not a "badly designed Fractal," that's a badly designed strategy from a poor strategist. 
---
My fractals full run (cms-t4-recs) yesterday was with a pug, including a power reaper. It's totally fine.
---
You replied to a separate commenter not op ??
---
&gt; why can't we stat swap them?
---
Spaghetti too I guess since they seem to be closer to trinkets in the hero panel and you can infuse them (like a ring).
---
I'd rather see no new elite specs, but the ability to have a secondary profession of which you can select only utility skills e.g. Necro/Ranger with Necro weapon skills but the ability to equip Frost Spirit etc...
---
The current main professions would still be better, because you can trait most of your utility skills to have additional effects, but it would open up the meta a bit imo.
---
If we get an expansion, gib Cantha and Dervish, Paragon and Ritualist as elite specs...
---
I really dislike how elite specs are handled. The more you have of them the harder it is to balance the game.
---
Imo ther already is way too much skillbloat in the game 
---
I'd like if they don't release the next batch but rework/balance the current ones.
---
Not enough confettis if you want to know my opinion. XD  
---
But i do like this screen a lot !  
---
Maybe tempest with endurance replenishing skills might be useful.
---
Haha thanks! But there are definitely much better people than me to answer that question so you can ask that in a different thread and get better answers :)
---
I'll however tell you what I normally use, it heavily depends on kind of content you're playing as well, I mostly pvp or wvw so for UI I have everything set up so that I get max field of view, then I have auto-targetting off, since I get very high pings I usually set video settings to performance mode when in crowded places or content or in wvw in a zerg. All of these are definitely personal preference, and nowhere optimal or what may suite you!
---
Hard cause of the agony resistance though
---
The word p2w means you can buy gear equal bis gear from the gemstore. We have no such thing at all. Buying the game is not p2w, it is buy to play which is different from games that are f2p or have a monthly fee.
---
This is indeed true.
---
I think the content drops are one of ther perks you get for having a subfee. I was also super suprised how miniscule the cash shop is.
---
Meat Shield, Heart Surgeon, Astronomer. 
---
Librarian, Lawyer, Activist. 
---
Sex Worker, Farmhand, Fire Service. 
---
Haha! Yeah! What a poor peasant! /s
---
for easy access to the event timer you can write the following in your game chat:

---
My theory is that this needed to happen. Remember at the start of the episode 5 we did the trails and at the end Glint said to Aurene that she needed to talk to her about Ascension ,maybe the Ascension is about dying and being reborn again. Since now all think that commander has failed them they will all leave and try to fight Kralk on their own terms divided ,so that in the end when all it's lost "us" the commander comes flying on the back of Aurene to save the day. I feel like this is close to the Doctor's Strange visions in The Avengers only one possible future when we win as Aurene had those vision ,it's all about The End Game . But who knows I'm just  speculating.
---
What i meant is that sometimes, you can not get use to a character or a situation. It feels like you just discovered it and ... tada! Things change. I like plot twists. They are what make the story live and go on. Without them nobody can move on. But i really wish for a "statu quo" situation in next episode. The kind of moment where everybody need to rest. 
---
I suppose that the LW story tellers assume that we rest bewin the episodes... But i'd like to find this kind of moments inside an episode too. But i swear if there's a new cliffanger in the next one, i'll be happy too. :)
---
I mean, that's literally all there is to it, no need to be rude. Trinkets (yes, backpieces count as trinkets despite whatever spagetti code you found) cannot be stat swapped the same way armor and weapons can. And no Anet dev checks this question thread btw.
---
We used renegade for a while until first time noticed this, also...
---
&gt; one of the reasons we dropped running it 
---
But not the only one, neither the main one. 
---
We just go with chrono+FB supports now which works much better everywhere, especially with SA being basically removed now. It's a full package - 100% quickness/alac/might/stability/protection/aegis and decent healing with proper specs. A bit lacking on offensive buffs - just singet sharing from FB - but can be compensated with running pSB as one of dps and just overall having a MUCH better uptime of everything. Far from what people think is the best, but it is certainly most convenient and reliable setup we had yet, which is something we aimed at due to running fractals every day all year.
---
If you're curious what we didn't like with FB/renegade:
---
- Lack of chrono utility - it hurts, a lot, and wastes some time here and there
---
- Still god awful energy usage of skills on revenant - hopefully gets better one day, but not waiting until that happens, will just play better stuff meanwhile
---
- Lack of stability - yes, FB does some, but we run an extra mantra on chrono which makes it almost 100% uptime, considering some fractal mechanics it is very convenient
---
Also with FB/chrono you can now go 100% offensive stats if you wish to push your damage further with diviner gear - works really well with both of the builds if you know how to use them.
---
&gt; lol no. you aren't carrying anyone by playing 2-3 hours per day.
---
So you realise those 2-3 hour guildraids during prime don't affect PPT, but you somehow believe those players don't play outside of guildraids at all... 
---
On top of that - you call out those guilds and tell them they destroy WvW for not always caring about objectives / PPT during limited guildraids in timezones that you yourself say aren't capable of carrying PPT in the first place?
---
At first I assumed you were just uninformed, but now I realise you're plain stupid. 
---
Go to the options, scroll down and choose 'Simple Party UI'. 
---
Congratulations - from now on you will never ever experience this bug. 
---
Why and how does it happen? Nobody knows, but use this solution and don't be ignorant. Some people intentionally not using it and keep crying/causing wipes in fractals. 
---
?  i absolutely care no shit of wvw bro ...
---
it's fking so skilless compare to pvp.  i'm plat 2 btw.
---
you can sayywhatever you want .........  wvw is still shit that's it
---
Do you have an Instagram or twitter where you post your work so I can follow? You’re so talented!
---
that's kind of contrary to what you said earlier about basically having one boon-bot so the rest of the party can tunnel on dps'ing the boss.
---
I am fine with a new set of elite specs on every expansion. Imagine if we got elite specs every LW season? They wouldn't be able to manage all that for balancing. 9 elite specs every expansion really isn't bad.
---
I'm coming back after 3-4 years of not playing. So I got a few questions to get a nice start back in the game:  
---
1. I've never experienced raids in GW2. I raided alot in WoW so I'm aware that there might be a team "comp" that is preffered. What are the most preffered classes for this type of content?
---
2. What is the state of guardian? I barely played the specialisation in HoT and I liked the class. But Im also thinking about starting fresh with a new character.
---
3. So maybe as a follow up of the previous classes. What are the "meta" classes?
---
4. What is the main source of getting gold these days? I really want to finish my personal quest in obtaining a legendary weapon.
---
5. Are fractals still a thing? And are there still cheese mechanics like kiting mobs to a wall and mass AoE the shit out of them?
---
6. Did they fix that the condition stack is a personal stack instead of a group stack? So that condition orientated classes can do a bit more damage on group events?
---
7. Is karma still relevant?
---
8. What would be the best thing to start doing right now? I'm thinking of purchasing Path of fire eventually.
---
9. What are peoples "daily routines"? Back in the day it was farming CoF and AC etc
---
10. I still have this GW2 T-shirt on my account that I've got at gamescom. Do I get style points for wearing this? /s ;-)  
---
Thanks in regard!
---
It's because the shift towards hypercasual content. Communication and interaction with other players are not necessary nor desired. Why talk to people if you can all feel interconnected by watching eachothers shiny charactes? 
---
Don't you feel warm inside whenever you see 50 other players press 1 in your general vicinity?  That's what truly friendly communities are like!
---
That's a clap right there
---
TACO markers are ideal for many things. For example, take that 24 dwarven chests achievement from the latest episode. Better than any video guide. In general TACO markers are better than any kind of thing that would be ussually explained with a video guide like those mega-laberynth puzzles. The only issue i have had with them is sometimes having troble finding the starting point of the run, but the routtes ussually start near easy to find waypoints.
---
Its supposed to be emblem for dnd alignment.
---
I mostly use overwolf with gw2 pocket knife. 
---
GW2 is a masterpiece. But it took me too much time to realize / get used to it.
---
I came from GW1, started in prophecies and bought all expansions on release. Fell in love with the world, the build customization, that you could build your henchmen army if you want to play solo or to go into group content for harder content. Mained a Monk in GW1 and played nearly exclusuvely with him.
---
Then GW2 launched, got hyped and insta bought it. The fact that you can play as a Charr sold it to me. The world looks still fucking AMAZING. 
---
Realized there is no monk so I had to look for another class to satisfy me. Weapon skills are preset, you couldn't swap them. Everything is very different from GW1.. so I soon stopped playing after launch.
---
Came back after LA was destroyed to LWS2 and started playing on and off, not as much as GW1. Still couldn't get hooked.
---
Farmed like a madman Dungeons before the nerf, enjoyed it and started playing daily.
---
Started to love this game when LWS3 started and am loving this game more and more from day. I just have to see it as a standalone game and not as a successor to GW1. This is not nearly anything I expected, but I got used to it and love it. The combat feels awesome, I just wish we could choose our weapon skills on our own. The world looks beautiful and the story gets better with every release.
---
&gt; So you have a dragon who are as big as half of core Tyria and somehow you want to have a dynamic fight 1v1 \[...\]  and wave your toothpick 
---
Of course, when it's written this way... XD We could wave Aurene ... or a dwarf ? That's bigger than a toothpick. I should considerate that i shouldn't wait more than what we had. 
---
&gt; just to high expectations 
---
I answered that in my original post.  "*My mistake, maybe i misunderstood."*
---
If he expect the starting area to be hard then he have way to high expectations. The starting areas are always easy because new players who have never ever played any game before up to players who played evereything learn everything from super slow to fast. 
---
But if you want to have fun with him, tell him to boost and then move to PoF and drop him off in the a Forge area and then watch him die. 
---
Or wait until invasion event starts and drop him off there to deal with it. Or take him to a dungeon and let him figure out how to surive without tank or healer. Or the bandit champs or legendaries. I mean there are a lot of spots in the core game that have difficulty but it is also leveling areas and will never be as hard as the expansions are.
---
Mine is named Mender. This is gives me a chuckle.
---
Those nodes aren't at their locations because the program can't tell you what map you're on. It's an overlay. It lists locations where nodes are found on all maps, but the way the game works, that means some nodes will be present and others will be absent. There's simply no way for taco to know.
---
I used taco to help farm karma during wintersday, I use it for guild missions like bounties and races, and a few other odds and ends as well.
---
There there's something specific you need a route for, it'll give you a route.  For something like the orphans on Wintersday it was perfect, since they're all on the same place on every server.
---
Nodes simply don't work that way.
---
The funny thing is, that the FF14 community complains about the same things we do. They have also a 3 months release cycle. And their patches have way more to them than every LW update. More story, at least 3 new dungeons, 1 new raid (either 8 or 24 player), a lot of optic stuff like new minis, armor and weapon sets, new housing items, new features and gamemode. But still, the community is complaining about how predictable the release cycle is. :D
---
I don't want to compare Arena Net with Square Enix because this would be a discussion that goes nowhere. And I don't want to say that Arena Net needs to do the same thing as SE. (Both companies are completely different in size and resources after all.) And the fact that the playerbase in FF14 also complains, even tho they get objectively more content with each release, shows that you can't make it right no matter what you do. But there are some things like the support of older content and QoL updates, that Arena Net really needs to sort out sooner or later.
---
It is also easier for SE to drop new jobs into the game, just because they are not linked to something that already exists. This makes the balancing part easier. Each job just needs to be good at the task it was designed for. They sacrificed player choice for more possibilities to expand on the system. And I don't know whats better... Having a set amount of classes that can do everything, or having an not defined job roaster where everything has it's fix role in the game.
---
...I thought it's Snargle's Bone Fiend...
---
Sorry, Frostbite. ( ._.)
---
But what does it have to do with GW2? It's clear that it' meant to be chaotic evil blablabla, but besied the flame and the blue shield, nothing has something to do with GW2. (Maybe the yellow hand for the warrior signet.)
---
Little guy on the end with the wrong balloon is just happy to be included.
---
&gt; I understand why you might think so, but it's better (in my opinion) to  have a story too fast than too slow, especially when waiting 2-3 months  between parts. 
---
You got a point. And i guess the last few seconds and the way they are directed worth more than anything else in the episode. I can get out of my mind the very last picture of all this.
---
It's just to give my vision of what it would look like if gw2 has it.
---
Hey, feel free to send them all the cash they need for a hardware upgrade, I'm sure they'd appreciate it.
---
Guess you get ignored a lot then.
---
Then I hope your vision comes never true. :(
---
Rip
---
My first thought. Hoo boy, Snargle is gonna have a field day with that one.
---
I don't think having more elite specs is a good idea, sure it could be fun, but making the game harder to balance is questionnable.
---
Don't you worry, epsiode 6 will bring her back (remember how she ate Joko). And hopefully when she returns she will be a little bigger, enough for us to ride on her back for an epic finale on last episode. What i'm not sure is if anet really wants to kill Krakaltorric for good on a LS season and not dedicate an expansion for it. Seems that they will do it since seems that no expansion is between LS4 and LS5.
---
if that was what your going for i have to say you've failed miserably because the symbols have barely a connection to gw2 and some of the symbols barely make sense for their allignment
---
Slippery Slope isn't as bad as you make it sound...
---
Personal Story has some shiny moments especially in regards of the racial choices and some of the Order Characters. For me it gets SO boring after that and until you reach the shores of Orr; then it becomes interesting again
---
It's fascinating to see the change in crea I've direction since the game launched. Fortunately, for the most part it changed for the better. Unlike the competition where it has devolved into putrid coalescence of posts given by a NPC ahah 
---
F
---
Citation or it didn't happen.
---
I’ve only played dungeons and a couple fractals and it’s all been easy so far. It’s quite a casual MMO compared to others. One thing gw2 doesn’t have is that ultra-end game challenge
---
Let's put it this way; a wvw pleb like me can get above plat 2 in "skillful" pvp. And from my experience, the people at plat 2 nowadays are either meme'in around because they realise the competitive nature of GW2 is dead or they're pretty mediocre. 
---
Sweet dreams. 
---
Somehow. I like this theory.
---
The anomally appeared to me right on the Scions&amp;champions last fight when I was hunting achievements
---
O.O  
---
You don't mention Taimi. Do i need to replay the episode ? Did i miss something huge ? 
---
By the way, with the whole Caithe thing (being "Aurene-branded"), we maybe know how to look after the Taimi's disease. Maybe. Assuming Aurene will eventually come back.
---
I would rather have less visual polution and be able to easily identify skills uniformelly. While cool, I think this kind of change wouldn't be so healthy for the game, especially for the competitive modes
---
I'm more amused there's no a guy with a balloon and Choya Dance Tonic.
---
I've been trying to post this over on Tumblr for eons now. It took me a little over 2.5 days to get this from sketch to complete and finished painting. I haven't played the game in awhile and finishing thing painting made me want to jump back in.
---
Tbh thats exactly the same in gw2 outside of a single section for a world boss/adventure now, haha. Outside of map completion, most players aren’t just spending time in non-expansion zones.
---
There was a decent bit of reason to travel to old maps outside of “dailies” in gw1. There was lots of different HM farms and reps and such. Both games have a pretty large amount of very inactive content as a whole though.
---
https://www.snowcrows.com/ and https://discretize.eu to answer most of your questions.
---
4. depends on your age, if you want to waste your time: SW, Tarir, and all the daily stuff inc. fractals, once you get PoF add Istan to that; if no - buy gems.
---
9. depends on people, my daily routine is to stare at gw2 shortcut for a brief moment before i go to sleep.
---
The Reaper Necro class is great - higher DPS than base via Reaper’s Shroud, plus using Greatsword is cool. My friend speaks very highly of the Guardian Dragonhunter Elite, and I’ve seen other players do some amazing things with the Thief Daredevil Elite. Plus the ‘meta’ builds for almost every class are Elite specs. 
---
So... yeah, I’d say they are improvements to the base in most cases, but in the end it depends on what you’re doing. If you’re just running around doing Story and Zooey World stuff then a well-geared non-Elite is going to do fine, but if you’re wanting to be as useful as possible on a team or in PvP then you probably should check them out.
---
Good luck! 
---
&gt;concentration, condi damage, precision and expertise
---
Seraph has 3 of those 4 stats, with vitality instead of expertise. But firebrand can get 100% burn duration anyway.
---
Anyone can confirm this? 
---
&gt; I barely see anyone talk about it
---
You haven't been to reddit for like half a year or so then... It's like every second or third post about fractals has comments about it. I heard devs have problem with making this bug happen on their servers (where they can test possible patches and look at data while it works). I wonder it it would help if they added option to turn on debug mode in client (as in - you choose this option in client and play, during this time all the data connected to the game is being constantly send to ANet, so you can re-create this bug for them), but I don't think they can add something like that without problems (lawsuit ones, not technical ones). 
---
There is a sale on the game that ends today. Half the price so if you want to have the elite specs from both PoF and HoT you can get them for 25 Euro but yeah sale end today.
---
I cant really find myself in your experience but different strokes i guess.
---
For me in gw1 with just elite capturing a map already saw more replay value compared to gw2. If only because gw1 gave you an actual reason to play alts. my necro might not have needed to kill the boss for his elite but my monk did. Also every time the meta changed different elites were needed. which made you go to areas you would not go before.
---
In gw2 with its whole "everyone can play everything" mentally it in reality boils down to just stick to 1 character since it can do everything.
---
Compared to gw1 this game has no skills. ANet  lost their creative balancing touch long ago.
---
My post wasn't some kind of a speculation - it's a fact mate.
---
As soon as you switch to 'Simple Party UI' this bug won't occure anymore. But you have to switch before joining fractals, not while inside.  
---
Me, my guildies and many other people can confirm that.
---
It was epic! You did a fantastic job. Thank you.
---
Now if you'll excuse me, off to buy some gems.
---
Well Character differences become a lot more obvious when going towards speedruns. Then there's a teamcomp you usualy want to have, because they're ideal. Skipping stuff, mesmer portals, Aegis at the right time, and many more. Also the classes do play differently, can't compare an ele or engi to a thief or Warrior.
---
What is a paid account?
---
Oh lord. If Tonns wife was part of the pact squad, I'll be dead before morning

[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/White\_Mantle\_Portal\_Device](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/White_Mantle_Portal_Device) maybe?

Thank you so much :D Here's \[Twitter\]([https://twitter.com/\_aledraws](https://twitter.com/_aledraws)) and \[Instagram\]([https://www.instagram.com/\_aledraws/](https://www.instagram.com/_aledraws/))
---
But the egg/Aurene was just another entry on the list. We were originally chasing an unspecified valuable/powerful artifact, then a piece of Glint's Legacy while *already* rushing through the jungle to save our friends, and the world because Mordy was kinda ruining things everywhere. No idea what activities we actually dropped to watch her hatch since we were zooming all over the place even within individual episodes for any number of reasons. The name thing was a telepathic communication from Aurene herself which is definitely *not* how regular parenting works.
---
The teaching part definitely is a grey area I give you that, we don't know how much or how little time we *actually* spent doing that.
---
For PoF you are completely glossing over the fact we were hunting and (reluctantly) trying to kill Balthazar long before Aurene got involved. We definitely did not travel all the way to the desert just for her, she was still safely holed up in Tarir. At the time of our death we had already met Kormir and learned that Balthy not only intended to slay the Elder Dragons thus plunging our world into chaos, he was going to absorb their power and slay the other gods! Aurene definitely does play a major role in the finale but we are not merely there to save her, ironically enough we are there to save *Kralkatorrik.* 
---
And finally this episode very much tried to portray Aurene and us as *equals* with the whole "Scion and Champion" tagline. What parent worth their salt would use their child as *bait?!*
---
A side branch of grieving for her (assuming she stays dead ofc) obviously is in order, what Trahearne *should have* received from sylvari PCs and more, but basing the entire primary motivation for the coming episode(s) around grief-based delusions for Aurene specifically sounds absurd. Worse than LS3E3 Braham only we are forced to play *as* the idiot, no thanks!
---
Yeah, I agree. Time is what I need LOL
---
I liked it 🤷‍♂ I mean it would have been implausible\* to personally fight and win against an Elder Dragon that kept the whole continent in terror for more than a hundred years. It would have retroactively erased the stakes and the competence of all the NPC heroes we meet in the game (including the Orders).
---
(\* saying this as someone who only just started PoF's story so no future spoilers pls)
---
pvp wise for the most part yes. 
---
Some core specs are competitive or even preferred in some cases. Core guard, and thief are really good. Core warrior is a favorite of mine. 
---
Dunno, I personally felt disappointed by LS3. The 2nd half of LS2 and HoT are imho way better written and paced. (I've only just started PoF, so can't comment on that yet.)
---
&gt;some skill can be used while CC ( not stun break ) some can't
---
Just a small note about this: if a skill has no cast time, 99.99% of the time it can be cast while you're CC'd.
---
Because you are talking out of your ass man.
---
"The sky is green"
---
"No its not, look its blue.
---
"Seems green to me"
---
Our conversation basically.
---
Give the game a shot before you talk bullshit man.
---
that was culling and got fixed ages ago.
---
You need to use the discover tab.
---
You can combine weapon parts and the inscription in the Discovery panel to discover the new recipe. Also, take a look at http://gw2crafts.net/ for guides to get your crafting leveled up quickly.

Soldier gear doesn't provide as much protection as one might think. It's the traits, utilities and, yes, the gameplay that make the difference. If you're using Spellbreaker without it being fully unlocked, you're also not doing yourself any favours. Since getting 'ganked' while running through TD seems to be the issue, I'd suggest Defense traitline, with Dogged March, Defy Pain and Last Stand. Shrug It Off under Tactics too. Also, pick your utilities correctly for what you're doing, don't just slot whatever metabuild says. Replace the offhand axe with a warhorn, try a shield or a sword, see what works for you. 
---
What build are you using, if I may ask? Although I know the build is only HALF the equation (the other half is learning to play it). Thanks!
---
Happened to me too in the exact same spot lol
---
afaik the only class better than elite specs (not counting niche situations) is core warrior, you have higher damage output than on spellbreaker
---
Odd. I did it only to the point where the guy said YE-AH. I think that was only twice?
---
Yes, use block or distortion.
---
&gt; I’m currently wearing Soldier runes/gear for the extra toughness 
---
Soldier gear (and many other "defensive" options) hurt you more than they help you. 
---
If you're a high dps spec you can kill most enemies before they land hits on you by using active mitigation (dodges, positioning, ...). This is "good" gameplay. 
---
If you're looking for a sustainy build, you'll need to spec into that through traits and utilities. It will take you significantly longer to kill stuff, but the build has SUSTAIN to heal up when you facetank a bunch of hits. 
---
Slapping soldier gear onto semi-meta specs is NOT a sustainy build. Soldiers is an unoptimized mix that doesn't give neither sustain nor DPS. It lets you tank 1 or 2 more hits - but you lose 50%+ of your effective power so you will take twice as long to kill stuff. Which for most inexperienced players means a lot more than 1-2 hits. This puts you in an awkward spot where you don't have enough sustain to slowly bring anything down even if you fail several dodges; yet you also don't have the DPS to burst things down while you have your active defenses available. 
---
If you want to make builds "easier" you should almost ALWAYS spec into active defenses (e.g. using utility slots, traits, sigils or runes for stunbreaks, condi clear, mobility, damage mitigation, ...). Only after that or when damage is unavoidable (PvP / WvW / ... ) do you want to spec into toughness / vitality. 
---
There you go! Your character is so devastated by the events, they go on a week long Chocolate Omnom Berry Cream Bar binge! Better?
---
streaming is for when you didn't fully downloaded the game and you still press play. if the game then encounters something you need it will download that first, resulting in that you see models popping in which where not there before.  
---
has nothing to do with this bug.
---
Your own arguments are refuting themselves. In the one hand you are saying that these other games don't have fight mechanics and are you just stand there and dps. Then in the other hand you are saying "well, if those other games had this game's 'get out of mechanic free card' then their encounters would be a joke."
---
You either have never played these other games, or you are one of the people in this sub that just shit on any MMO that isn't gw, just because they aren't gw. I'm guessing the latter. 
---
&gt;There are trade offs we had to make in order to have a trading post and in order to further our technology on weapons themselves (like crazy animating stuff). We made that choice years before GW2 shipped. Along with cutting variable stats and GW1 style customization. Dyeable weapons is not even a topic of conversation, let alone being on the table. Yes, we can create technology to allow us to do things we could not have previously done but I don't see this being one of those things. In fact, we have probably even crossed the line of it being possible with all the crazy stuff we have done on weapons since ship. That is not even assessing the gross amount of work that would be required to update the hundreds of existing weapon skins, and that alone would probably make such a project out of scope.
---
&gt;EDIT: loss of variable stats were for the trading post, loss of dye was for other technology.
---
Where do they say that backpacks are weapons? They may have made the same design choice, but that doesn't mean that they're the same.
---
Plus whining to the community won't change this. If you're unhappy about it feel free to make its own post in the official forums.
---
For Open World PvE i would HIGHLY recommend to run Base Warrior.
---
Also, i would recommend to try out Longbow.
---
Even on a power build, longbow does good dmg.
---
How's the fractal?
---
It looks really cool, keep it up!
---
But the question how good is it in Endgame  PvE and WvW, I would like to see golem test of it 🤔
---
It wouldn't help to rally every army to kill Kralkatorrik as if we kill him Tyria will disintegrate.  We don't have Aurene anymore to absorb the power that would be released.
---
If there is any conflict it would be that the rest of the Alliance wants to go after Kralk to finish him off now that he is weakened, and the commander has to stop his former allies as he knows that if they succeed Tyria will be destroyed.
---
Yeah, don't do this. Run a spellbreaker for additional defense/offense utility and similar damage. 
---
Also don't use a longbow.
---
It;s basically bad in everything else besides open world pve
---
&gt; I only downloaded it to a "playable" state. Is that my problem?
---
No, of course not, what would be the point in that then… playable means playable.
---
Does an error message show up? If not, consult the system's error logs.
---
I'm assuming you're up-to-date on drivers and OS updates and stuff?
---
wait, and next time post your crash reports.
---
I read about the living world stories needing you to buy them if you missed out on them when they were released
---
will they be costly? How does gem gain work in the game? I plan to buy the expansions only now since there's a bundle for HoT and PoF.
---
I think it is, I just re-installed OS last week because I've installed a new 500gb disk only for the system. I'll wait for crash log.
---
No. You can only use a completed plate once per day so hoarding them is just a waste. 
---
Its an MMO. Story should be delievered in group  content, not all of it but some of it yes especially boss fights. But i mean you can also paly story co op but its too fucking easy
---
Oh I remember that character in GW1. It was called Every Other Mesmer In The Game.
---
Positioning in those FFXIV videos is a joke, its like having a stroll in the park on sunday afternoon. There is no sense of urgency at all. In gw2 watch players use dodging weapons skills and teleports to get into position faster to comply with mechanics. And the reliance of tank mechanic is the lamest of them all. Makes it feel like the game is dumbed down for babies. GW2 tried to copy raid mechanics from alot of games like Wow, Wild Star and FFXIV. But it is precising because anet copies those mechanics raids in gw2 feels easy to very experienced players. It is because these experienced players are very good at controlling the characters that they play and the gw2 combat system allow them such precise control of their character.
---
Um no you don't need 2-3 seconds you should only need less than 1/2 a second which would make it much more engaging. That is why FFXIV is not an action game but a semi strategy and turn based game like you said. If you were to migrate the raids from FFXIV to gw2 players would have no problems clearing them because 1) players in gw2 don't need to get new gear expansion and they have all the time in the world to optimize their builds to suit every encounter 2) characters in gw2 have stun breaks, invuln, teleport and in some instances dodge while they attack without interrupting their skill casts. Players can also simply move out of enemy attack range while they cast their skills. Many deaths that would have happened in FFXIV would have been prevented and by passed by very experienced and skilled players in gw2.
---
I doubt it. At most, we'll get elite spec reworks.
---
Tangled Depths is like that. You need to either deal enough damage to lay down anything that looks at you funny before it kills you, or you need to have the right countermeasure for that enemy type.
---
For instance, bristlebacks. If you can't burst them down instantly, you NEED to use Ignore Pain, Shield Block or something similar. Even if it's not normally in your build. Switching your skills or weapons around takes a second, walking back from a waypoint takes a minute.
---
So for pocket raptors, you need AoE of some sort. For chak, depending on the type, CC can be very powerful. Also attacking them when they have that lightning shield up is suicidal unless they're very low on health.
---
Keep an eye out for patrolling enemies, try to pull fights away from wandering enemies if you can't handle newcomers.
---
Tangled Depths is much more about knowledge and preparation than buildcraft. Some builds might be able to faceroll it, but mostly you just need to respect the map and give it the time it takes.
---
Via a shitton of elder wood and mithril ore
---
Also good news, Charr and Humans are friends now and Ascalonian human civilization still exist thanks to Kryta, Ebonhawok it's like an autonomous city under the rule of Kryrtan kingdom. 
---
Also I recommend to try out Sylvari, they have some interesting lore in the game 
---
Not much has changed on that front. 
---
I run SC raid build on my warrior and in 95% of the time it works perfectly (can't be bothered to have yet another build template xD). I just swap out the banners for Bull's Charge and Might Signet. But like everyone is saying, dodging and sidestepping are your friends with full zerk gear.
---
Wow thanks for the in depth answers! I always loved playing guardian, and got way to many hours on it. So the reason I was asking that question is because in a raiding scene I can imagine that there are specialisations that are "underperforming". I don't want a class that has a hard time getting into groups. I might look into mesmer more. I quite enjoyed being the time warp slave back in the speed farming dungeon times.  
---
Regarding getting into groups..  is it still a thing to have "XX amount of achievement points" to be able to join certain groups? I hated when that was a thing back in the days.  
---
And (maybe) last but not least.. is Zommoros still an rng-asshole? :-P  
---
Elite specs are not available unless you have the corresponding expansion that has that elite.
---
You need to unlock every core skill and trait and be level 80 before you have the option of training your elite spec. 
---
Like everyone says, depends on the content. In PvP, most classes are at a disadvantage of that are running a core build into an elite spec of the same class, though there are exceptions such as core guardian for example. Elite specs offer a different form of gameplay and style for that given class. 
---
Yeah I ran another account mesmer up through that story step and parked him there to get all my main characters in...
---
I would vanquish maps again if they popped in the Zaishen dailies. So there was a reason to go back there again.
---
Same goes for Zaishen boss kills.
---
I still think GW1's had PLENTY of content for 1 character. I mean, I haven't finished it 100% yet and still have 1.5k hours in it (a lot of it is from PvP/GvG though).
---
I put Vanquishing as fun and sometimes challenging end-game content, on the same level as GW1 dungeons for me. I've never been into FoW/UW due to the fact I mainly did PvP/GvG in the early days and really never jumped on that ship.
---
I did do some of the farms, such as the Monk 55 hp troll farm, but I mainly played for fun instead of grinding.

Indeed PoF requires more mobility than other maps, also if you didn't maximise your 3/6 monts to 3rd mastery you can get left behind easly

&gt; Title: "Trying to bring raid elitism to open world, 4th attempt"
---
I mean, you're saying that you're "upset" because people aren't running *meta* open world builds... Open world is literally the only place where you can run whatever shitty or gimmicky build you want and have fun with that. Being upset over that is just... weird.  
---
Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of useful infos in your video but it clearly aims at people who are raiders or high level PvMers trying to maximize their efficiency in open world. It would have been much better if you acknowledged that in your video instead of calling casual players "open-world monstrosities".
---
I suggest obtaining a full set of exotic gear (zerker is my go to for most classes) including your trinkets and such before Heart of Thorns. That area can be very unforgiving. 
---
Really nice build, too bad you lose all your dps when you swap away from fire to get more heal or to do cc.
---
Lost my computer around on May/2018 (the week deadeye got a rework). Is Chaos Chrono still a thing? I used to play with a staff and had lots of boons that increased boon duration
---
ty
---
Well said.  Active defense, traits and the like are the way to go for defense in PvE.  Shouldn't need anything more than that unless you have ridiculous ping. 
---
Woah dude stop being so serious about someone’s imho. 
---
They won't. No if.
---
I'm reluctant purely because it would be 90% gemstore and maybe some legendary weapons variants
---
Been ill for a long while now...
---
probably snowcrows  
---
[https://snowcrows.com/](https://snowcrows.com/)
---
Yeah, the latest story instances have been pretty bad in this regards. We were going for the 15 minute achievement. It was a bit of crazy how many times a mount got stuck in a crystal, or from the newly formed dredge ramp, or in the crystal at the last part that shoots up. With changing landscapes, it really seems to be quite easy to get stuck. 
---
Getting hit.
---
Happened to me too. Epic music plays, riding on my griffon towards the greatest battle of the century and... nope, stuck.
---
kinda, but there was a slight nerf so that chronos are no longer the be all and end all of boons
---
On an unrelated note. Welcome to GW2, wanna be friends? XD I'm semi new as well so uh hit me up if you wanna play together. And yeah, do post your error logs or window if any, it'll probably clear things up. Cheers!
---
Now do it without needing the assistance of a quickness slave.
---
Thanks everyone for answering my questions :)
---
yeah, happens just about every second day in shattered observatory.. 
---
I had a good one on Twilight Oasis where after coming out of celestial avatar my character model didn't load back in. so, couldn't see myself, couldn't see the enemies.
---
I haven't bought the content in a while, but according to the wiki:
---
Season 2 is 1,280 gems
---
Season 3 is 960 gems
---
Season 4 (ongoing) is 200 gems per episode; 800 gems for the previous 4 episodes.
---
800 gems = $10 USD
---
If you're strapped on cash, you can skip season 2 and come back for it later.  Season 2 includes a lot of really great story instances and leads into the story of Heart of Thorns, but it's really not the end of the world not to have it.  But Season 3/4 includes much higher quality story and 1 new map per episode.  They are also some of the best ways to get endgame ascended quality gear.
---
Why is it bad everywhere else?
---
No you're the one talking out of your ass.
---
I'm not making up anything at all. There are plenty of videos of the main mmos out there detailing how their combat systems work.
---
No they are not I screwed up buttons, they are core mechanics of the different classes. It makes some classes more desireable and more suited for certain encounters than others. But you'd still have to be very proficient at controlling the different classes to use them properly.
---
The whole argument had been FFXIV has dumbed down mechanics to make encounters artificially harder than they really are. Gw2 is in comparisonis  only easy for players that are really good at controlling their characters and understand the underlying combat system really thoroughly.
---
LS episodes are free for about 2 weeks after they are released if you log in during the release. I believe if you missed out on those you can buy them for around 200 gems each. Which is about 2.50 USD, so convert that to whatever your local currency is. You can gain gems in game from specific Achievement Point thresholds or from converting gold to gems. The current exchange rate to get 200 gems is roughly 60 gold. 60 gold I can earn from doing daily fractals for 3 days, less if I get lucky. So it's not that expensive.
---
The regaining trust thing sounds really boring. I don't like revenge plots as most of them are pretty shitty and/or repetetive in their dialogue after a while, BUT if Anet manages to pull it off in a less annoying way, why not? I know most people like that edgy gritty stuff. I actually thought that the "We against the world" scenario would have happened with maybe Taimi as a stable factor on our side during our hunt for Baltazar due to Braham's drama and Majory doing her own thing (albeit very shortly) during LS3; so yeah, I wouldn't be that surprised (or disgusted lol). 
---
On a side note, the Pact Rambomander might also happen because of being suddenly kicked out from the last story instance if that was intentional. Like no optional dialogues between the characters, or by extension dialogues and/or interaction with Aurene's crystalized body (for a melodramatic effect, of course).
---
Do Ascalon Catacombs for exotic magi armor. The armor will have Monk runes which you'll probably want for your build so it's 2 birds 1 stone. You can then spend gold on weapons, sigils, food. Trinkets are a bit harder since you can't get magi trinkets the easiest ways you can with other core stats(laurels and guild comms mostly). Honestly I find magi no easier to get than harriers. If you have LS4 episode with Sandswept Isles that makes getting some a lot easier.
---
Another option, maybe not the best or cheapest way, is crafting the exotic harrier's pieces. It cost ~56g at the moment for the full set[(efficiency cost)](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-83626;1-83565;1-82311;1-83741;1-83873;1-83709). You get the recipes from Priory Historian Elisa [(wiki, her location changes)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Priory_Historian_Elisa), but she isn't always selling all of them so this will take time and a decent chunk of money. You do get the skins from it so if you don't have them that might be a reason to craft them anyways though.
---
The final option I know of is PvP/WvW for armor boxes, so if that's your thing or you'd rather stomach through that than dungeons or crafting you can do that. Personally I can't stand either and would rather pay twice the price to stay in my PvE bubble.
---
Not really, but you seem offended, that wasn’t my intention in any way. 
---
&gt;For instance, bristlebacks. If you can't burst them down instantly, you NEED to use Ignore Pain, Shield Block or something similar. Even if it's not normally in your build. Switching your skills or weapons around takes a second, walking back from a waypoint takes a minute.
---
The only bristleback move that hurts is the pewpew. You don't need endure pain or shield block to deal with this whatsoever. 
---
You can interupt it, line of sight it, dodge it and I think you can even have other monsters bodyblock it for you. In general almost all projectiles in HoT can be line of sighted without much difficulty. Just go jump behind a vine or rock or anything bumpy and the game grants you with full projectile immunity. 
---
I really wanna finish something i've wanted since 3 years ago, and that is Eternity.
---
Already got Sunrise but now i have to make Twilight.
---
So tell me how and what places are good and braindead gold mines??
---
I also like pacing things so I don't run out of material :p
---
And rightfully so! I've seen what efforts it can take to gather all the dialogue.
---
In hindsight, my comment above was a bit poorly phrased, but I do feel that stuff like this should be shared here. After all, it's not as if you can make these videos every week, so it'd be a pretty awful clickwhoring strategy.
---
10/10 Reaper is bad ass...rolled from a firebrand main and I'm having more fun than ever 
---
I'm confused, have they said no new xpacs are coming? Been out of the loop.
---
I'd be in favor actually if it meant more time and thought put into how they're balanced to avoid wrecking the competitive game modes again like PoF initially did. Hell it's been over a year now and some issues still aren't fixed, namely Mirage.
---
PvP\WvW will not survive another botched launch like PoF balance wise. They can only take so much. So maybe launch the new specs in a state that doesn't require a year's worth of balance patches. 
---
The last option seems to be the thing.
---
Lots of people are now reporting that it only happens with an Ele in the party, and that it usually doesn't affect the Ele themselves.
---
personally, i find crafting to be cheap until it hits the T4 anT5 mats. Just don't buy the mats, use whatever you gained through normal play. There is value in getting your crafting level up in an organic way because high level crafting will be needed if you want to obtain certain skins. I personally find it much nicer to do that, rather than rush it from 0-400 later on by buying mats in bulk from the TP.
---
Then you understood incorrectly. I did not contradict myself. Yes I said alot of games require you to move, stop, stand there and cast skill, wait for skill to finish channeling before you can move again. This will look like you're basically just standing there  casting skills. 
---
If encounter mechanics from other games were brought to gw2, which to some extent Anet has because they copied mechanics from other major mmos like Wow and wild star in particular,  then those encounters would appear easier  to experienced players in gw2. Not only because gw2 allow you to move and cast skills without interrupting the skill casts, but also because gw2 has class specific abilities that avoid certain encounter mechanics some of the time. 
---
Artificially using a inferior combat system that has slower movement and global cool downs on skills does not inherently make a game hard. It makes it clunky and players are artificially handicapped. Conversely having a superior combat system that has better character movement does not make a game with similar encounter mechanics easier, it simply allow for players to perform at a higher level because controlling the characters well still require alot of knowledge and practice.
---
I have no clue what chrono jail is. But by the looks of it.. it might be better to stay away from it? :-P  
---
Good to hear those requirements are not mandatory anymore!
---
Guardians are weird like that. They can be extremely hard to kill, but it all comes from active defenses. Aegis, blind, protection, dodging, invulnerability, healing, blocking, stuns and so on.
---
A guardian that lets themselves get wailed on will die almost instantly.
---
The Grenth Temple in cursed shore sells them for karma 
---
yea i didnt really notice at first either. but if you pay attention you can see caithe holding one of those flowers in her hands as it shrivels away.
---
Guardian, Engineer, Warrior, and maybe Thief all have core builds that are still competitive in end-game content somewhere. Otherwise, you're pretty much always better off with an elite spec.
---
Its a solid build for sure but I think you'd be better off with dire or even carrion in open world.  Yeah those are not the standard dps attributes but you throw on some balthazar runes and you'll be pulling 23k no problem while having the defenses that make up for ele's squishiness.  
---
Bonus of carrion and dire is that you don't need to make expensive viper's gear.  You can literally buy all rare/exotics and be pretty effective.
---
Play however you like that's the beauty of this game. but if you ask me this is the best way to do it.
---
1. Play your personal story and explore all the maps you pass. Finish your personal story. (play dungeons to earn exotic equipment)
---
2. Watch the season one recap it's 3h long so instead of a movie grab some snacks and enjoy.
---
2.5 start playing fractals and try to make your way up to fractal level 100.
---
3. play season 2 and finish exploring the world map.
---
4. play HOT
---
4.5 Try to start raiding.
---
5. play season 3
---
6. play Pof
---
7. play season 4
---
This is the order of things i recommend. It's how the story progresses and it will slowly rise in difficulty. Hot is a lot harder than what you are used to so doing fractals will teach you how to play a bit better. It will also gear you up so you can start raiding in the process. Season 3 will also be a great way to get tickets you are missing.
---
The original GW2 opening splash screen and music is STILL the best. I wish you could just default it to the old one forever.
---
Altough Reaper is pretty much the tankiest class for open world, Warrior shouldn't be that far off. 
---
Usually, I test out open world solo builds at the Domain of Istan's Mordent Crescent Great Hall. All of my best Open World builds can jump in there when the meta is not up and clear through the mobs quite comfortably. 
---
This is the build I use on the Warrior.
---
http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vJAQRAnX5ejEdQZH24BeeAnIGICKLAigeW/iXPGuyIDaeA-jBCBQBnUJYN2foSq/QgjAAAOZB5RDTFegCaU5HA-e
---
Ditch both elite specs for open world. Non of them will help you to survive nor are they a meaningful damage boost. Key is that you are constantly hitting to generate might, which will give you quite a bit of healing and near infinite dodges. The dodges will also give you might, which will again give you healing and more dodges lol. You can swap out 'Shake it off' for sth like 'Stomp' for even more breakbar damage as well as functioning as a stunbreak. But with the recent condi bombs from regular mobs, I just can't live without 'Shake it off'. Also, I wear Marauder trinkets just cause, but obviously you can swap them out for Berserker. Oh and 'Healing Signet' is also an option if you can't really find the time to use 'Mending'. Sometimes the signet feels better and sometimes 'Mending' feels better IMO. Just take whatever you want.
---
In a raid, a fractal or even a WvW zerg you expect people to have 25 might and fury. For example from druids (fractals, raids, ...) or from heralds (WvW zergs).
---
This build is designed to carry the most ~~useless~~ alternatively useful players. It provides huge amounts of basic boons as well as good personal DPS. Because -as nike explained in his previous video- you can't roll buff-specs and rely on your allies to do damage. You also can't roll pure DPS specs and rely on your allies to buff. In fact you can't rely on your allies to do anything other than press 1, in all honesty. Which is why 25 might share to lots of players AND high personal damage are so good for open world; and why this build is good here but nowhere else. 
---
Traits are cool and all but it's nothing compared to the cross profession builds of original GW. That's what I liked the most and that's kinda what bummed me out the most with GW2, and also having weapon types decide half of your skills. Still spent somewhere around 4k hours and achieved my goals. Max fractal, few legendary weapons and full heavy legendary armor. After that there was nothing left to keep me playing. Had 15 max level characters. Never really liked living story. 
---
I'd say GW2 somewhat lived up to my expectations but it never surpassed original GW. 
---
&gt; Caudecus had no reserves, no supply lines, no actual allies. 
---
I would disagree with this, in all honesty. He was able to elude the Shining Blade with his White Mantle the entire time of episodes 2 and 3. Even misdirected them into thinking he was heading to Janthir.
---
His supply lines existed otherwise he wouldn't have been able to fill Fort Evennia with bloodstone, and his manor had the reserves which he was going after for the war. We stopped him as he was resupplying, basically.
---
He also had allies in the form of Separatists, they just didn't send that many for him.
---
&gt; Ultimately though, social repercussions sound far more stupid than any part of this "plan" we had. WHAT ELSE is the world supposed to do?
---
I mean, we lacked the might of the Exalted who were designed for fighting Elder Dragons. We only had a singular weaponsmith from them. Where was Ruka and the Luminate?
---
And why did no one think about the idea of attacking Kralkatorrik with a hit-and-run tactic to injure him, get some of his blood/scale, and make a proper Dragonsblood weapon?
---
Even then, what about the Psi-Lance weapon? Right up the ally of renovated dredge tech. Instead we makeshift some dishes. Or thought about empowering Aurene a bit more.
---
Or hell, how about making a replacement for Zhaitan and/or Mordremoth so there's a buffer in case Aurene cannot take Kralk's power when he dies.
---
TBH, there were a lot of things that could have been done, using things we know about, that could have improved the situation.
---
In open world sword weaver with offhand dagger is usually more fun, but if you want scepter with more survivality, bring focus instead warhorn. Use obsidian flesh when in trouble.
---
You can also use the flame aura and have longer fire fields with scepter, and break defiance bars more easily with gale and comet.
---
The best GW2 audiobook series.
---
Thank you so much! Glad to hear you approve.
---
&gt; the new game mimicing both GW1 and 2 will crush Anet.
---
Which game?
---
&gt; Which I'm kind of hoping because the Commander hunting down a badly injured elder dragon and wanting to kill it solely out of revenge would be a nice counter point to Braham going off on his own rampage after Eir died.
---
:o
---
I didn't realize I wanted this until you said it.
---
Good point on the focus.
---
I truly love sword/dagger, the combo looks awesome to boot. But being melee can some time be troublesome, and mayube its just me but I find the damage to be bad and im constantly switch to water to survive. Do you normally use zerkers on your sw/d?
---
Second that on Defense/Adrenal Health + Healing Signet. 
---
I also use Tactics for Vigorous Shouts, since the healing comes in handy for solo or when I help out with my guild. Also has the warhorn trait if that condi clear and Swiftness might help with ducking a bad monster pull. 
---
After that, I float either Spellbreaker if I'm alone (plenty of counters and stuns) or Strength or Arms depending on what I my offense to be. Making things dead faster is still the best 'defense' in the game.
---
Now that GvG is dead perhaps the truth can be realized: that wvw has been the dullest game mode in the history of MMO game modes. Seriously, each night following a guild and its pugs from what ever server as they fight assorted guilds/pugs has been indistinguishable from the others. Aside from the samey imagery, the game's only consistency has been its lack of excitement and ineffective use of the meta, all to make competition noncompetitive, to make action seem inert.
---
Perhaps the die was cast when ANet vetoed the idea of regularly updating WvW; They made sure it would never be mistaken for a competitive game mode that meant anything to anybody, just ridiculously profitable cross-promotion for PvE. The game mode might be anti-Fights (or not), but it’s certainly the anti-Competitive game mode in its refusal of balance, engagement and excitement. No one wants to face that fact. Now, thankfully, they no longer have to.
---
a-at least the community is good though
---
"No!" 
---
The reddit is dreadful; the forums are terrible. As I read, I noticed that every time a player had something to say about WvW, the player said that they "came from PvE". I began marking on the back of an envelope every time that phrase was repeated. I stopped only after I had marked the envelope several dozen times. I was incredulous. The average player's mind is so governed by cliches and dead metaphors that they have no other style of writing. Later I read a lavish, loving review of WvW by the same Mark O'Brien. He wrote something to the effect of, "If these kids are playing WvW at 11 or 12, then when they get older they will go on to play PvE." And he was quite right. He was not being ironic. When you play WvW you are, in fact, trained to play PvE.
---
Pfft, you have 6 years of material.
---
Thank you! It's gonna be a long few months getting to the next episode. I need closure.
---
Try chaining your 4 limbs to 100 pound weights and then try fighting a 15 year old and then claim  15 year olds are hard to beat. Thats exactly what a dumbed down system like in FFXIV is like for players.
---
No, I mean literally child-like: [they looked physically young](https://huntersinsight.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/sylvari-03.jpg) in the earlier conceptual stages of the game.
---
Isnt this the old condi tempest build? i mean, i remember the simple rotation from HoT but i dont remember if it was called Might God before the might share got buffed to 10.
---
I wanted Guild Wars, but 2. I want GW1's combat in GW2. I know PvP had its problems in GW1, but in GW2 combat is just such a mess that it's hard to do well without cheese.
---
Anyway I've put 4,500 hours into GW2 and I love it, so.
---
That the term "wars" would imply PvP and not some neglected off shoot while the game instead focuses on casuals and boring living story
---
The goal of the build is to showcase decent DPS and might/fury sharing, the exact DPS number is not really relevant here only the order of magnitude (~3k vs ~20k). It can be 18k or 26k it's not really the point in the end if I understood the video correctly.
---
That’s pretty much why I’ve stayed out of the story beyond LW2. Life’s been difficult this past year, the game was a nice distraction for a while. Lost my kindred spirit in life, found one in the game (yay, a moment of joy) lost that one too. Not much hope that either one will be coming back. 
---
I believe toolbelt skills are the only engineer skills affected by your legendary (I run rifle Holo with the HMS Divinity)
---
Typically it's better. Base warrior is still a better power banner than spell breaker when you don't need boonstrip though.
---
Awesome! Great walkthrough, really enjoying the feedback on here great ideas.
---
Thanks. I didn't read carefully enough.
---
it is rather good in raids were it not for the fact that druid can stack 10 man might whilst also healing and granting other boons. If druids might stacking capability was removed then it might see play in raids or a healer variant of this build would maybe be played. 
---
So I know Druids tend to be the might stacker in raids but why can't this build be a replacement if you don't have a druid. Wouldn't it still be effective if you had this instead of a druid and lets say another healer instead? It just seems to me like this could be effective as an alternative if you just don't have the optimal comp.
---
I have to admit. I see where you're coming from. As I said I play alot of WoW and its the same there (as actually everywhere), dps are the vast majority of the playerbase. Long que times etc. I love to play tank in that game just because I dont have to care about my dps and can purely focus on tactics.
---
But since you notices "top dps". Does that mean gw2 finally has a dps meter? :O
---
It doesn't work since it can't share any boons to allies anymore with traits and SoI. 
---
😂👌
---
Well it's pretty obvious that the reason why Zojja doesn't get screen time is not that they can't get Felicia Day. Anet doesn't really mind changing the VA for a character as we can see with Rox and the Male Charr Commander voice.
---
I don't mind at all when I have players who are complete deadweight in recs... because it's recs and generally ridiculously easy. Less experienced players should be able to tag along, chill out and have a good time. But your post pretending that they're not hitting the dps of more experienced players because they're making a choice to sacrifice dps for utility (and contributing as much or more to the clear by doing so) is ridiculous. Maybe that applies to 5% of randoms who join a T4 group advertised as "recs" - the other 95%  are just bad and actually contribute next to nothing to the clear.
---
That's good old invisibility instability. It's icon and description is invisible too for better immersion.
---
Anyone know how Living World sales work? I was able to buy most of the story content I’m missing while it was on sale last week, but for some reason season 2 (or was it 3?) wasn’t on sale for me. Was it because I (for some reason) already had 3 episode from it? Or was it just not on sale this time for some reason?
---
I have my raptor mount, but I’m wondering if there are any forms of fast travel other than paying for waypoints or the 2 week passes.
---
And can someone explain why the Copper fed Scrapper is recommended so much? I’d think that the higher percentage would make the Master Kits worth it. Similarly, could someone explain the Runecrafters scrapper? That seems like the best deal ever, but I’m wondering if the specific “Runecrafters” name means something. Does it only give/breakdown certain items?
---
Exactly, I'm sure I could have joined whatever squad was there and leeched quickness or whatever other boons from them too. The idea was just to show gameplay. I don't know what people want, like am I supposed to go out of my way to get no buffs from any sources when I make videos?
---
what build are you using exactly?
---
I'm going to pretend I understand your criticism. What point were you trying to make?
---
They wouldnt spend so much time on caithe just to throw it away, a new model etc. Additionally we have gotten an aurene themed mastery every episode. They said we get one more mount this season. The whole season has been about bonding with aurene. It all makes sense and points heavily towards resurrection
---
Honestly, leveling up a Thief, I preferred Sword. Probably Sword/Pistol. Sword's auto-attack has a very nice cleave that helps with most open world trash mobs. P/P Unload is brain-dead easy, sure, but like you said, it eats up Initiative and has no cleave. I think in most instances of the open world, cleaving is better than single target DPS. Sword/Pistol 3 is also a very nice cleaving burst with evade built in.
---
Sbow for off-set weapon for open world mobility and when you need to tag lots of mobs and don't want to be in the melee mix too much.
---
I think people called it "PS ele" then.
---
first, learn when to dodge and how to position yourself, then swap to zerker's
---
You mean Varya? She's the Dredge leader in the open world map. And she's the one that comes to save us in the final fight. And I don't recall seeing any Dredge after that. Even if there was, I think it's a little ridiculous that she dies and they come up with a new leader in the course of the fight lol.
---
Thats actually quite a myth. -&gt; https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Potent_Haste
---
As you can see, theres a circle AROUND the FB with 180 radius AND a "cone" which is more like a rectangle though thanks to the circle with 450 RANGE.
---
Its really quite comfortable to buff up with mantra, because thanks to the circle you also buff players behind and beside you. The rectangle-cone in front of you is HUGE.
---
Not to mention, you overstack quickness by quite a lot, and you have other sources for quickness that arent the mantra itself.
---
Honestly, its more difficult to get people to stay inside a well for last pulse than it is to buff quickness with mantra.
---
Also, stacking is the most important mechanic in guild wars. Idk, you really shouldnt fail at that.
---
Awesome, I have something around 110k karma, should that suffice or will I be running low?
---
Thanks for the quick reply! Great to hear, that a fix is on its way :)
---
If you like watching tv series in random order of seasons then do them in any order. Remember that plot have it's continuity between expansions and living stories. Doing it from PoF will render some plot twists useless for you so it's better to stick to original order as it is presented in your hero menu.
---
People will tell you here to grab mounts asap but you shouldn't. First, you can use them only in open world. Second, you will miss a lot and probably never figure out how to navigate HoT maps. New players have also something I call cheat syndrome. When they use mounts everywhere, skipping vistas, jumping puzzles they consider exploring as too fast/easy/boring and they quit.
---
 
---
If they killed off Almorra without paying proper attention to her, I would be pissed to no end.
---
Someone like yourself, who takes optimization so seriously, should understand the implications of the lack of quickness and alacrity.
---
If you want to feign ignorance for self-defense, then that's your choice.
---
If you want me to think lowly of you for doing so, then that is also your choice.
---
&gt; I would disagree with this, in all honesty. He was able to elude the Shining Blade with his White Mantle the entire time of episodes 2 and 3. Even misdirected them into thinking he was heading to Janthir.
---
Well on the GW2 map Janthir isn't too far off and the Shining Blade aren't an army. They probably knew he was doing *something* suspicious but with mesmers on both sides who knows.
---
&gt; His supply lines existed otherwise he wouldn't have been able to fill Fort Evennia with bloodstone, and his manor had the reserves which he was going after for the war. We stopped him as he was resupplying, basically.
---
Supply *lines* as in the infrastructure required to keep his army fed, equipped and maintained for several *months* of laying siege. He hauled everything he had with him on the initial assault, failed to secure fisheries or orchards and holed his forces up in 2-3 main fortified positions. He was definitely going for a massive assault in hopes of immediate victory with no backup, a Helm's Deep not winter in Moscow.
---
&gt; I mean, we lacked the might of the Exalted who were designed for fighting Elder Dragons. We only had a singular weaponsmith from them. Where was Ruka and the Luminate?
---
I have asked myself the same about multiple factions over the years, mainly the Pact. Given their usual excuses the ~~Protoss~~Exalted from ~~Aiur~~Tarir probably got stuck mopping up Mordrem and not answering calls or offers for asura gates.
---
&gt; And why did no one think about the idea of attacking Kralkatorrik with a hit-and-run tactic to injure him, get some of his blood/scale, and make a proper Dragonsblood weapon?
---
*Any volunteers?* No but seriously there's plenty of stupidity in the general plot or at least what we are and aren't told. On that note what about the blood Caithe collected in the closing of the novel?
---
&gt; Even then, what about the Psi-Lance weapon? Right up the ally of renovated dredge tech. Instead we makeshift some dishes. Or thought about empowering Aurene a bit more.
---
Probably because ANet forgot about it. Maybe Zojja could have reminded us- oh, wait...
---
Personally I'd have commissioned a "resonance catastrophe" weapons project, Psi-Lance-based or otherwise, the instant Balthazar fell if not sooner. But that is using real-life physics knowledge, I always assumed crystals in Tyria worked *differently* because they're "magic" and no one had built anything of the sort to use against Branded and Icebrood.
---
What would be safe to feed Aurene though? Short of blowing up another Bloodstone I can't think of any reasonably accessible concentrated magic.
---
&gt; Or hell, how about making a replacement for Zhaitan and/or Mordremoth so there's a buffer in case Aurene cannot take Kralk's power when he dies.
---
I believe we spent several pages on that with me arguing **in favour** of a massive Bloodstone research program. Doesn't help in killing Kralk though, nor with the "not getting eaten along with the fabric of reality itself" part.
---
&gt; TBH, there were a lot of things that could have been done, using things we know about, that could have improved the situation.
---
Who else knows about it though, and of those who has access to the supplementary knowledge to actually put anything into practice? I mean no one ever bothered to tell *us* about the anti-dragon weapons forge between the Priory and Orr, Ratas Novus, Arcanum and especially Primus seem to have lasted *decades* between the three if not *centuries* and their tech was completely novel, no one secured the Maguuma Bloodstone or reported the literal river of souls around it, heck who knows what *else* the Priory have stashed away somewhere when they just *happen* to have a portal into Glint's lair? Speaking of her, Glint somehow knew of *all* of this at least in terms of broad strokes and key events, yet never bothered to actually contact people in power? We probably could have skipped Prof. Gorr, Rata Novus and half the leyline stuff had Trahearne (or DE pre-GW2) just dropped by Thunderhead and asked "yo, gonna kill some dragons, got any tips?"
---
Bottom line, anyone who might try and talk shit to anyone involved in the latest battle is as much if not far more to blame for the failure than those who actually helped. 
---
Some of the elites seriously change how the base class plays. This is how I feel about axe mirage. At its base, it doesn’t seem like it would change all that much with axe and mirage mirror, but in play it ends up being much more active and fun. Especially for shatter builds. 
---
Hmmm not sure.  Check out the wiki for actual values. I think 200k karma may be enough. 
---
Well, you are not the only one who have been shattered. Another example is Aurene.
---
- Constantly kite enemies at ~600 range unless you're overloading air. 
---
- Use blinds from earth skills (3 and 5 on sc/wh and glyph of storms) and air 3. You dont need defense if enemies dont hit you.
---
- Avoid staying long in water/earth, using only a few skills in each should help you defend yourself. 
---
- Use earth/water elemental to hold aggro. 
---
- Use one with air trait for superspeed (zephyrite runes can be a good experiment, but considering how expensive scholar ones are, it may not be worth it). It'd be hard to hit you if you move fast.
---
- Take lightning flash and arcane shield if the problem still persists, to kite even easier. 
---
- Take arcane spec (x-3-2) instead of fire for some extra defense.
---
Do all of the actions above one by one in that order, you shouldnt need all of them, but practice utilizing first few. Against tougher mobs (with no adds) or larger events where CC matters use focus for extra CC, otherwise always use warhorn because it has superior damage, heal, support and aoe.
---
Not sure if this needs to be mentioned, but **never** use wash the pain away on a dps build in open world unless it's a big group event (but even then you dont need to use it). Glyph has much higher value, especially when casted in water/earth.
---
Nothing compared to what we have today. I mean the game is good but it didn't fulfill my expectations, they finished making a side-MMO and not an MMO I could main and become stronger in as GW1 was.
---
Each episode usually has a handful of songs created for it. You can look on [ArenaNet's SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/arenanet) to see what's uploaded already. The songs specifically for Ep5 might not be up yet, but are usually uploaded within a month of the episode's release. For reference, Ep4's music was uploaded a month and a half after its release, while Ep3 was released a few days after the episode. If I had to guess, it varies depending on how spoilery the track names might be
---
i strongly recommend besides tekkit's tacos to install the [reactif pack](https://www.heinze.fr/taco/)
---
taco can be used for everything like guild mission rushes, certain raid bosses, fractals..for example the aforementioned reactif pack has been great for doing the chair collection
---
I just checked so many boosts I made an ahego face
---
This is explained either in this video or the prior one. Different environments have different needs. So what's optimal to a raid isn't necessarily optimal to open world. For instance, the incidental healing and spirits that a Druid brings to the table in a raid edges it out over a Tempest in regards to utility. Those factors are less necessary in an open world context, whereas the increased personal damage that the Tempest provides is more useful. It's not just a case of comparing 25 might vs 25 might, it's a question of what each brings to the table in their specific contexts.
---
really? did they change that? originally it was only for two weeks. Tbh I dunno the exact time limit since I get all of them day one anyway.
---
Honestly, if I never had to go to the mistlock except for crafting or map swapping, I'd be so happy. Having a Merchant and Bank access would be amazing. I love the mistlock and it's by far the best pass IMO, but sometimes I don't want to load into a map to a grab something. 
---
It's an addon. [Arcdps](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/) is one of the few safe addons you can use. It tends to break when there's a major patch, so pin the bin folder to take less time to uninstall and update whenever that happens lol.
---
Mandatory reminder: arcdps is a tool to assess your own performance and get better, try to avoid being toxic because of it. My comment above was just for the luls.
---
With what the olmakhan are capable of, they are dangerous
---
Casual gamers are people who play for a limited time. Casuals don't have or aren't willing to invest the time / energy required into learning the in's and out's of the game. Despite a lack of time and energy invested into learning the details of the game, plenty of casual gamers do aspire to improve at their own rate. A casual player might not be able to min-max their gear to the extent of the most hardcore players, but in a game as GW2 they can come damn close with very limited time / learning investments. 
---
What you consider "casual" gaming has very little to do with casual. It has to do with a preference towards your character having flavour, uniqueness, a certain feel to it, ... over being effective / performant. Which is a fine choice in and of itself. 
---
However, it's really rude to pretend casual players are the ones running around with shitty or gimmicky builds. There are plenty of casual players who don't insist on running gimmicky builds. And there are plenty of "hardcore casuals" who spent more than enough time and energy on the game, but simply prefer the non-meta choices. I mean how is "hardcore casual" not a contradiction? 
---
Stop pretending that choosing to play gimmicky stuff is "casual". It's not, and it doesn't take into account the casual players who prefer performance over being special / unique. It also creates unrealistic expectations which lead to confusion and toxicity. 
---
For example : 
---
There's **no issues with "casually" raiding in GW2.** But it might require using effective setups. Learning bosses isn't difficult as proven by teapot and multiple others a dozen times. Doing some raid bosses doesn't take a lot of time either. 
---
There's **no issues with "gimmicky" raiding builds in GW2**. You can complete raids with literally any build, green gear, full meme squads, ... doesnt' matter. Again proven by teapot and plenty of others. However - it may require somewhat knowledgable players depending on the boss / content. 
---
What you can't do in GW2 raids, is being too casual to invest any time into training / practise, but also insist on only running the most "gimmicky" stuff possible. (Actually you can, it's just even harder and thus less likely to succeed). 
---
The issue with GW2 is not that things are too hard and that all these meta raiders are too toxic. The issue is that "casual" is used for a catch-all for several traits which have nothing to do with playing casually, and the unrealistic expectations and demands that this creates. 
---
Please stop offending casual players by pretending gimmicky and shitty builds are all casuals. I'm sure many of them are, but pretty much everyone on this subreddit knows more effective biulds exist and how to find them. They choose if they do or don't want to adhere to these builds and that has nothing to do with being casual or not. 
---
it depends a lot on how good you are at spvp and how much you play, unlike WvW tickets, the final tier of the sPvP pips track do give you repeatable 100 ascended shards of glory:  
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended\_Shard\_of\_Glory](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_Shard_of_Glory)
---
So in theory you could get a full set in just a single season.
---
my main issue with how anet handled kits is that they picked almost the worst skins possible: coconuts for grenades, lvl 1 pleb rifle for mortar etc.
---
it's much better than hobosacks were but they could have put a bit more design into them..it's pretty glaring to do all the fancy holo skills with lasers and then start tossing coconuts
---
at least ele conjures are better looking
---
Hello! I’ve been playing the crap out of my Charr warrior. I got him into the fifties at launch, and just came back to GW2 a few weeks ago, after a **really** long break. I just hit 65 on the warrior, and it’s still a lot of fun. I’ve been bashing everything with two-handed hammers and great swords. The two-handed hammer animation is just so much fun to watch. Occasionally I switch to sword and board. 
---
In any case, the warrior is very mobile compared to other MMOs, and still a lot of fun.  I think you made a great choice, but be sure to try out some of the other classes too. 
---
Enjoy the ride! :-)
---
Pokémon Blue/Red Bicycle Theme
---
After the events of Heart of Thorns, the Pale Tree's been drastically weakened. Having to protect yourself and an entire race from a dragon's corruption would do that for you.
---
But what about the marks? Don't you need 3 marks for each piece?
---
More elite specs is just bad.  It will get to the point where they just make them for no reason and it will be even harder to balance.  At most, we get one more on land and maybe a water spec if they decide to go that route.  As of right now, they need better balance and more repeatable content, not new specs.  Like grinding map currency is not really repeatable content imo, more stuff like rotating raid cms, fractal cms, and other things like that.
---
It works amazing, what is your issue?
---
One heartbreak at a time. ;P
---
Gw2 is far better in non-raid content for me, because you don't rely so heavily on your group members which makes pugging more bearable. 
---
Your group members died to a stupidly easy mechanic when the boss is at 10%? Well, if you play well enough you can solo the last bit. The  most memorable moments of PvE to me were those clutch moments of me and sometimes another friend duoing the encounter when the others died. You rarely pull it off but damn it feels great. 
---
As a DPS/tank/healer alone in FFXIV, you are fucked, period. It's really frustrating when there is nothing you can do because your team keeps dying, e even more so than in Gw2. 
---
quick answer:
---
gw2 does not support the role of tank, you shouldn't be a tank in any way, unless you are a chrono in some endgame content; play full offensive.
---
don't want to die ? kill enemies before they kill you, don't take unnecessary hits.
---
also if you get the berserker elite spec, you can use your healing skill, it heals you for 25% of your damage for 5 seconds.
---
Its not so much change as it is "Episodes now take 3 months to come out instead of 2 weeks".
---
Happened to me too, just before attack the eye attack phase. I tried getting close to the aoe so id getkilled and respawn but the crystals protected me. Luckily walking back through crystals got to a place where I used springer and was able to get out of the crystal.
---
Would have sucked to restart that mission again.
---
They still add it sometimes just.. very inconsistently
---
You could always do what I did and spend far too much money and have a character of each elite specialization. Then rotate through them, a toon a day, and never accomplish anything.
---
I second his agenda, especially the tip to start playing fractals as a side activity during exploration of the rest of the world :)
---
What if  Countess Annese is a vision from Glint and wants us to cut throat the charr human treaty? We always knew she is fishy.
---
That's why I didn't farm PvE in GW1. I farmed PvP/GvG mostly in the first 2 years.
---
So far, I only have a Monk, Ranger and Elementalist that I can really play. My ranger being the one closest to finishing all titles.
---
I do have some Dervish, an Assassin and some other, but really, GW1 is not alt friendly when all I care about are Zaishen and finishing titles lmao
---
You should probably play World of Warcraft instead. Sounds like a more suitable game for you
---
There's no reward for using the boost on a leveled character vs a new one. It's up to you but I would say it depends on how much sentiment you have with the levels character.
---
You acquire mounts during the first few missions of PoF. Open the mission tab and select the option to start the PoF campaign.
---
DON'T USE YOUR BOOSTED CHARACTER. I'm sorry for the caps but new players use the boost then get confused. Play the game through naturally from 1 to 80 learning your skills and traits.
---
You won't unlock Mounts until you start doing Path of Fire content.  No you don't have to do "POF endgame content" for it, as you'll unlock the mounts as you work your way through the meat of it.  But you can't unlock them earlier or in any other way.  Yes, mounts are unlocked for your account, so once you have one, any character can use it regardless of the level.
---
So with the rework to Sigils and Runes we can now salvage them, which is the "upgrade salvage chance" listed on various salvage kits in-game. The Runecrafter's salvage kit has a 100% rate to salvage the rune or sigil equipped to a piece of gear, this is where the "runecrafter" name comes in as salvaging Sigils or Runes could yield a Charm or a Symbol (based on the Element listed on the upgrade) which is in turn used to craft other Runes or Sigils.
---
Ideally this is used on Masterwork (green) gear as those are the lowest tier of weapons or armor with upgrades (runes or sigils).
---
The reason you're using the Basic Kit (or the Copper Fed as they're both the same value of salvage) is because its the least expensive kit per use. For example, the Master Kit is 15 silvers 36 copper for a set of 25 uses. I'd imaging you'd feel pretty shitty for wasting 15 silver per kit to salvage gear and only getting a handful of copper back from selling the materials. Essentially its not very effective (where as for salvaging Rares or Exotics you'd make 3 silver profit back, as Globs of Ectoplasm retail for about 18 silvers). The copper fed, while you're initially having to pay off the 800 gems used to buy the kit, costs 3 copper per use (roughly in line with the basic kit's cost per use, but with infinite uses).
---
In any case you're not using it for Rares or Exotics in the first place, mainly using them for White, Blue, and Green (or white and blue only if you have a Runecrafter's Kit which, like I mentioned, is better for your greens).
---
The only issue I had was the camera shake - it decided to go totally insane in this section. I did manage to turn it off eventually!
---
Never ever believe in some random guild what think it can say what a meta is. I've been using non-meta builds in raids, Fractals and everywhere else without any problems. Meta is a lie and it is built for overly competitive people who want to complete content as fast as possible instead of enjoying it.
---
Did you try?
---
I am exactly in your position, except that i am 10 hours more advanced. GF convinced me to buy PoF, i used my Lvl 80 boost and asked myself the exact same question about the mounts.
---
1. Play the game like you want. If you have a good time leveling by yourself, do it that way. You mostly level by completing maps, but doing the "heart" quests does most of it. If you are a social player like me who doesnt want to play alone, at least play the Path of Fire campaign to get yourself at least 3 mounts, some mats for crafting and Karma/luck for gear (and, mostly, to learn your class).
---
2. You get the raptor instantly by starting the PoF campaign. you need to level the raptor up until he gets his upgraded jump. You need this to move forward in the campaign, this is a quest where you have to go to, like 5 or 6 points which are unreachable without a mount. With upgraded jump, you can get the jumper, then you can do the rest of the quest.   
---
After that, you get the levitating ray at a certain point in the story. And these 3 are by far the most important mounts in the game. You can get the rest with those three while you travel across the PoF map to get every fast travel point, which you should do before doing dungeons or raids anyway.
---
I know, i'm not as much a help as more experienced players, but i was stuck at the same point as you.
---
&gt;Ironically, even with gw2 horrible build diversity the balance team still just can’t figure it out
---
Also, ironically, us GW1 veterans refer to GW2 as having horrible build diversity. Yet, in terms of the current MMORPG market, no other MMORPG comes close to the build diversity that GW2 brings (maybe ESO, I'm not as familiar with ESO?)
---
A friend did he told anet about multiple gliches and bugs especially one which are with charekter movments during action camera
---
I recently read that snowcrowes is a good reference for meta raid builds. Used to visit metabattle are they as good? And what's the best place for fractal builds? 
---
2. Even core guardian is in meta (for pvp and wvw). In pve, DH is its pve power spec, FB its condi or support spec.
---
For fractals, discretize.eu
---
Snowcrows is best for raid builds, but most of their builds are copied straight into metabattle, and metabattle has relatively recent builds for all other gsmemodes, including fractals.
---
What a shame. At least hearts and map completion are per character. : P
---
Is it impossible to enjoy efficiency and speed? 
---
Season 2 is only worth getting if you want the story first hand and for AP/Mastery points. If you're fine for both of those just read/watch a summary. Season 3 and 4 are much better value
---
Just FYI: If you do the side story "Knight of the Thorn", the Pale Tree's health changes a bit.
---
Welcome! I have been gone for 5 years and just came back. Enjoy the experience. It's a freakin' beautiful game!
---
ps - Don't get caught up doing heart challenges. Exploration and Public Events will be both more fun and more rewarding :D
---
hello to a complete noob
---
Play through the levels, using the odd Tome of Experience you'll get daily.
---
1 It's fun.
---
2 You'll learn the character. 
---
3 You'll learn the game.
---
4 You'll find people doing map events.
---
Honestly, that depends on the gamemode.   
---
Generally, in PvE you're better off using an elite specialization, simply because they do more damage and are more survivable (at least most of them).  
---
In PvP and WvW on the other hand, core specialization are sometimes even BETTER than their elite spec counterpart.   
---
In PvP for example, core guardian and core thief are very good right now. They are frequently played in monthly Automated Tournaments, which is the most competitive gamemode Guild Wars 2 has to offer at the moment, which means classes played there, are considered the most effective at their respective role.
---
In WvW you should pick core classes for roaming mainly. That's because zerging requires pretty specific setups to work properly, and you will most likely get kicked out of the commanders squad if you try to join with a core specialization. That being said tho, for roaming there are so great alternatives for core specializations that work very well, too! Namely Core Warrior, core ranger, core guardian, core thief and even core mesmer are really good at roaming alone or in small groups.  
---
In instanced PvE (Raids and Fractals) as well as WvW Zerging very specific classes and setups are required from you, that will get you kicked if you don't fulfill them. Most of these setups are elite specializations only.  
---
For PvP, Roaming and Open World PvE it simply comes down to what you like the most and find the most enjoyable. In these gamemodes you can make almost anything work, if you're good enough with the class and have a good build with it.  
---
If you have any more questions, I'll be happy to answer them :)  
---
In theory - no. From balance standpoint - 99% yes.  (There are some exceptions tho- f.e. Core power warrior in fractals is better than spb it you dont need boonstrip)
---
TL;DR of this guy's comment chain: FFXIV ONLY BAD GW2 ONLY GOOD
---
Each game has it's upsides and downsides. Each one has factors that ultimately comes down to opinion for which of those two it falls upon.
---
You are not only stretching the truth, but being deliberately misleading, forcefully polarizing subjective factors in order to get the uniformed on your side.
---
I, personally, as an opinion, prefer slower, large-kit combat. This will not be true for everyone. It doesn't seem to be true for you. But it is true for me. I am neither inferior nor superior for having this opinion. I simply like the strategical teamwork factor it allows, and don't see the lack of twitch-reflex gameplay as a downside. Again, this is subjective. You likely don't feel this way, and neither of us have an invalid opinion.
---
Presenting FFXIV as a bad game because it's not the game you like (GW2), doesn't make GW2 sound like the better game. It makes you sound like you can't separate your emotions about the game from your opinions, and are trying to reach for a conversation "high ground" to feel superior about your choices. Like a child trying to bully the playground for not liking what you like. Please try to present why you like GW2 *without* bashing other games in the future, please.
---
TL;DR: PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO LIKE OTHER THINGS
---
Oh it totally could. But when I look broadly at gw2 landscape design throughout core and both expansions, it fits within certain "friendliness" that a dead dragon crosses in my opinion.
---
Granted we could walk dead dragon carcass in hot, but dead head is over this line. It's what I label "vile", like entirety of realm of torment 
---
Perhaps I'm wrong and we will get it 🙂
---
The colors are incredible! They really make this complete. Love it!
---
I was expecting GW2 to be more serious with it's cosmetics. Pretty much all armor sets we've seen in trailers looked like they actually make sense. The first time I've played the beta and saw the female light armor starting skin was a bit awkward, but still ok considering that it was one set out of many designs that looked more serious. Today, every second character looks either like a gogo dancer or glows like a christmas tree set on fire.
---
I am still hyped for this game. But it is more an "I still love the game and want to see what happens next" hype. Maybe this is also related to the fact, that I play it less now than 6 years ago. I can go days or sometimes weeks without starting the game and still look forward to the next time. It is really hard for me to explain because, at times, I was also really annoyed by it. (After LW2 and HoT release for example) It's a love/hate relationship. Yes we scream at each other, but deep down we both know what a good time we had together. :D
---
I am not really disappointed or anything from what was promised prior release, to what we have now. GW2 is different to GW1 and thats ok. Even if I only look at GW2, we had a completely different game in 2012 than now in 2019. I don't like some decisions Arena Net made over the years like abandoning Dungeons (mostly the "never toughing it again" part). But it is overall a good game I like to play.
---
How do you classify those who simply don't care? As in, plays ranger on longbow but uses rabid gear because that was first on the list for TA skins, then stands just beyond melee range most of the time? Or joining raids as a core necro in knight/nomad mix while not even having Blood Magic traited?
---
Says the person who keeps deleting their comments on half of the threads here after they have been criticised and created baseless drama.
---
Something Something hurting someone's feeling (or internet points I guess).
---
What kind of spoiler did you think it was?
---
I doesn't care if his comments hurt your feelings, but he cares if his downvotes hurt his amount of internet points. It's annoying but also kinda funny.
---
Whomever classified this post as \[Fluff\], A+! \*sigh\* So many "serious" people who misinterpret such a simple joke thread. 
---
In any case, no, I'm not angry. No, I'm not triggered. If I were, it would've been a much different post.
---
I do admit though I was amused by the response. While the post was not written with the intent to troll, it turned out to be a troll-lite post.
---
I'd kill for a "Pre-Expansion Map Playlist Group" and a "Expansion Playlist Group", personally. I LOVE the new expansion songs but the ones from when the game launched are just no good in my opinion. But I can't replace them because it replaces both.
---
Seems to be a slightly generic error. There are a lot of threads online about the issue. Some things to try:
---
Run Memtest86+ to see if it's faulty RAM.
---
Make sure your RAM speed is configured correctly in the BIOS.
---
Remove third party add-ons if you have any.
---
and here I thought everyone had the same health pool. Just so happens it's the 3 classes I play the most all have the same pool.
---
&gt; top 5 hardest hits for death summary in all game modes.  
---
An interesting idea, but as a general rule in PvP you won't find single large damage packets... now more so than ever.  If it summarized the damage done in 1-2 seconds preceding your death it might work better (for PvP at least).  
---
&gt; less particle cluster fuck bloom esp in darker areas.  
---
I get that they dont want a menu with too many options but the bloom, particle effects and general siezure-fest is almost all tied to a single setting in the graphics menu:  Post Processing.  
---
And on my own computer there is next to no difference between the high and low setting, low may as well not exist.  
---
This setting controls things like bloom, some infusion/aura effects, mouse-over highlighting and much more.  
---
Again, this setting needs to just be completely broken up and made customizable though keeping a list of available preset settings in a menu would be reasonable.
---
&gt; "knockup" targets  
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  ^^^I.know.you.mean.a.zero.distance.launch ;)
---
Basically that is what I was getting at. Yes I know you want a Druid and why it is meta. But you might not have a Druid and for what boss you are doing you have everything else lined up, healer, tank, dps, etc, but no might/fury generator. This seems like it could work to fill that roll and still output an okay amount of DPS along with it.
---
The meta is there for a reason for sure. It helps provide the comp to defeat the encounter as quickly and efficiently as possible. I know that most raiders are used to clearing everything each week and just want to get through it as quickly as possible so the Meta is what they go for. It is also great for those who don't know the fights that well to make sure that they have the best chance to complete the encounter even with a couple of mess ups.
---
However the meta is not needed to complete any encounter and nobody needs to hit benchmark dps to win as well.
---
Again I get it, nobody wants to waste time seeing if an off meta comp will work.
---
I would love to do build craft but that is very difficult especially without Legendary Armor to help swap out stats. I wish they would add an option in the Training Zone to do a temp swap on stats/runes/sigils/infusions and add food/utility so you can test out builds without having to spend the gold to test them first.
---
Who knows, if we had that there might be way more effective builds that can compare to the meta but it would be too expensive to test them out and too risky if they end up failing.
---
Soulbeast works well with power too 
---
OP, When I get home I will link my build for you. Your warrior can be tanky with good dps. This is how I've been playing open world pve for the past two years. I run around the open world with no concerns. I easily fight 4-5 mobs at a time with no issues. Tangled depths is no difference unless you're fighting the tough elites. For tough cc fights I'll go axe/axe for dps and mace/shield for cc and survivability.
---
The wyvern roost for flax farm in Tangled depths I usually take three at a time. By the time the fourth aggro I have two dead.
---
Other than having pain in the ass rotations to set up (core ranger fits this, having a weapon rotation and a pet rotation that you need to manage at roughly the same time as the other) core spec power builds are decent in a fractal setting, not so much raids.

On the condi side of things, oof. You're either running classes that can abuse conditions (Epi Necro to just cleave off a single target to get around its low condition durations), classes that can just barely run a condition build (sinister thief with runes of the affliction, [similar to something like this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vZAQJAoYl8MhmnYRTwpJQ/EHtElvMujUUHAHwC0/iGdLA-jxRAABXqE8l9HA4EA0xDAAblfWr+j06BIFAM7tA-e) but you might not be anything remarkable), or classes that are just so far out of the norm that people will start to question your sanity, like this [abomination that is the core sword/sword bannerslave](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vJAQJAscjMdQlHW7BefAnIGmCsbAGAGZZJYE0C0gQMYCA-jxRAABYr8Ta9AXqEEgTAg1q/0xDAon9HIFAMLrA-e)
---
The achievement one is cheaper, but takes longer to complete. Crafting is faster if you have the materials or gold.
---
I had to stand *on* the table.

Have fun mate. I already play this game 6 years, from the day it launched. Lots of fun in many ways. Regular pve, fractals (small instances), larger instances, structured PvP, world vs world (server vs server), raids, very good personal story, and incredible living world. Find an active guild and you'll be set for good.
---
OP asked for it to be removed and the other user agreed, "GTFO with this nonsense" doesnt sound to me like that user wants to see it in a rotation.
---
wrong subreddit?
---
This is super interesting, thanks... I’m not in the habit of thinking ahead with the heals like you’re describing, popping the heal in EXPECTATION of a bunch of incoming damage from a pack of surrounding mobs, which Ill then counter by doing damage out - that’ll take some getting used to. Great tip though - appreciate it! 
---
Appreciate it - thanks! I’ll need to check out Mace/Shield - I’ve got them, but always use Axe/Axe or GS typically, though I’m not sure where along the way levelling up I stopped using them... 
---
Spam bot is spammy.
---
Your last sentence made me laugh. This sums up the start of HoT soo much. I’ll never forget my first experience. “Oooo look how cute, those tiny raptors”.. 5 seconds later: “what the heck did just happen?”
---
Yeah; in 2012 when the game was first released. We are now 6.5 years into it, and ANet has definitely changed their approach to this. (ie they chose to make the commander Elonian for this season's trailers)
---
Well, I think you're getting confused here, friend, which is of course understandable.
---
Berserker (HoT elite spec) is focused on healing itself through damage output after popping its heal skill.
---
As a Spellbreaker, which is what I probably should have explained in further detail, you can't have the Berserker's damage-to-health healing skill. I could recommend sticking with Mending just like with Core warrior, although "To The Limit!" is also great. Natural Healing, the Spellbreaker heal skill, is great in solo play, but horrible in group play since it rips you own boons (along with all your conditions) when you cast it. The reason behind it ripping your own boons, is because Spellbreaker has a minor trait that gives it a stacking damage bonus when it strips boons -- this also works when you strip your own boons with Natural Healing.
---
As a beginner Spellbreaker, though, I would just focus entirely on getting the hang of Full Counter. Full Counter makes or breaks Spellbreakers, and when you pull it off well, it's extremely rewarding.
---
If you have any other questions you can reply to me here or message me. I have a lot of playtime hours on Warrior :)
---
This is what I did for my Reaper, however keep in mind you’ll ALSO need to finish two different scavenger hunts to get the right materials AND have at least 1 Vision Crystal on your inventory (drops from the monthly reward chest if you choose Chest of Ascended Materials as the reward) - it’s not quite as simple as ‘finish HoT and you get it’. 😏
---
Regarding the copper feed scrapper :
---
Beyond what's already been said. Simply having a salvage kit that you never have to replace is a massive convenience. In later game stuff like fractal dailys, HoT meta events, Istan meta...or anything farming related; you will get a ton of items, most of which you'll want to salvage (like blu or green items) to get more value from them. Being able to click the machine and salvage half your stuff in seconds, vs carrying a bunch of salvage kits and having to replenish every so often, is pretty significant. Saves time, item slots, and annoyance. 
---
If you want an ascended weapon fast, your fastest option is finishing HOT story and doing the Knight of Thorns epilogue quest. You get a complete ascended weapon from that quest, which includes a great sword option.
---
I mean they are not mutually exclusive, you can do both. As you are the one that gave the speech.
---
Yep, I’d get both Expansions while they’re on sale - I was an early player that left for a few years but now am back - the game is in a great place IMHO with tons to do and the community is one of the best (I was deep into WARFRAME too, and loved that community as well for the same reasons: helpful, polite, always up to do stuff, etc.)
---
Good luck and hope you have fun!!
---
If I remember correctly, only the Golem was on the last platform, the Asura could've been controlling it from elsewhere so they're not confirmed dead.
---
I know! whatever happened to Bait-o-tron though? Everyone who helped take down the death-branded shatterer is there except for him. Where was our job counseling-panhandler-charity service-combat medic-heroic-bait golem when we needed him the most?!
---
Tbh it's never too late to get into this game! :)
---
Also, the learning curve for Open World PvE in the basegame is rather flat imho; but if you plan on playing the story and the maps in chronological order, be prepared to die a lot at the beginning of Heart of Thorns :D 
---
As for the learning curve in Fractals and/or Raids: Fractals start out on a low difficulty and gradually become harder; tbh I think it's quite doable to gradually improve. I didn't raid so far, but there are guilds out there that specialize on raid training, so improving in raids is pretty doable too I think! 
---
The expansions are on sale regularly; tbh I though there was a sale going on rn? Correct me if I'm wrong!
---
One last tip: take it slow. Take your time to learn your class, learn your weapon skills etc. and enjoy the beautiful world of GW2 - and don't use the Lvl80 boost you get from buying an expac for your first character - or else you might feel kinda lost.
---
&gt; no longer exists because "deleted"
---
How convenient. Like you're not really helping. Can you see how that hypocritical it looks with your edgy flair and you way of wanting to appear superior over the mass of sheeple that' can't even begin to comprehend how smart you are. From the outside you just seem full of yourself.
---
And because I don't know because you won't tell me because you probably think I'm too inferior then I mostly have what I see and what youy leave to make an opinion for myself.
---
Since you seem to blakc people here block annoying people why the double measure of needing to also remove quite a few posts?
---
You are not getting into the game too late, the content in this game goes away and Anet encourages players to go back and revisit old zones and stories. 
---
For more hardcore things to do, check out this wiki page: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endgame
---
If you want high skillcap and roaming class in pvp, a good choice is thief, especially s/d or d/p thief. On other hand, thief has most braindead rotation in pve, extremely easy. 
---
Youll also have option of cheezy dagger 1 shot roaming builds in pvp, but i never found fun in those.
---
I also play engineer, which is on other hand muuch harder (and id say stronger)in pve, with piano rotation. Havent played it in pvp, but i know holo falls in meta for roaming and pvp, while scrapped can find its place as support in zergs. Also holo is very strong in solo pve content
---
For other classes i wont talk as i havent played em.
---
The whole Legendary Weapons and Legendary Armors ANet nailed at least.
---
The last game that I can remember that had something like was old Everquest's Epic Class weapons quests, and the GW2 Legendaries are very very similar to them.
---
In fact, pretty much most of your endgame content really is working on your Legendary Armor and Weapons (*as well as working on PoF mounts such as the Griffon and Roller Beetle*), when you arent doing dungeons / raids
---
I used to hate GW2's mentality of all items of X Tier being the same and that it was the item's cosmetics that you were farming for, but actually its kinda freeing. Legendary items are just overall 10% better stats than Exotic / Ascended, but its really for their special cosmetics / looks that are used for showing off
---
The build I had on that video was: [http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vJAQNApeRjMdQXIWFCmdAnIGICK9Lm+twCgIYAwT4FWBA-j1RBQBmUJoCPBA4RfAlU/BAPCgHcEAuy+jyPA-w](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vJAQNApeRjMdQXIWFCmdAnIGICK9Lm+twCgIYAwT4FWBA-j1RBQBmUJoCPBA4RfAlU/BAPCgHcEAuy+jyPA-w)  
---
There is a lot of room to tune it how you want and sigils for example can be changed to anything and were just what I happened to have on (I swap them a lot)  
---
What I like about it is that it can interrupt and stun enemies and then lets me just GS #2 on them (should use sigil of impact in the GS!) and that the build has so many defensive skills.
---
Expansions are on sale (50% off) all the time, in fact one just ended with the most recent Living World release. Look for sales around in-game festivals (lunar new year and super adventure box coming up) or content releases (Living World or new expansion). If you're worried about cost, play to 80 in the base game and see how you like some of the content that's available. GW2 is quite a bit different than other in-genre games; if you find that the combat mechanics aren't to your liking, you probably will have a rough time enjoying endgame.
---
It's never too late to get into the game. One aspect of endgame (Fractals) has tiers built in so you can learn mechanics without difficulty being over the top, while you build your gear to be able to participate in more difficult tiers. You can usually find training groups for raids to learn the mechanics for those as well. Overall I'd say learning curve isn't too bad, but I've played the game on and off since release so some things are probably second-nature at this point. Best advice is to just play the game and get a feel for combat mechanics, do dungeons as you level to experience slightly more difficult content, and if you're really interested in optimized builds for endgame (once you get there) check out [dT](https://discretize.eu), [SnowCrows](https://snowcrows.com), and to a lesser extent (unless you're interested in WvW/sPvP) [Metabattle](https://metabattle.com) if you want to know what accepted "meta" builds look like.
---
In general, you'll probably get better responses/feedback here if you post more direct/specific questions, but I'm happy to answer if you have any other questions before jumping in. 
---
If you think I'm going to take the time to explain why I delete what I do, every time someone questions it, then you're fooling yourself.
---
I have no opinion of you, neither do I care to...yet. If you want to continue this, private message me because this thread is not where it belongs.
---
Anet has left a way out of basically being prosecuted for losing our entire force on a failed attack... Did you see the 3 avatars appear around Kralk's head just after the final large crystal blast?  Combined with Taimi's announcement of Zhaitanic energies being read, means there wasn't a complete blunder so much as something happened that absolutely nobody was expecting.  
---
With that said, yes.  The commander will have to take casualty reports, answer to their allies for the losses suffered, and almost certainly lose the authority to give orders... I think it would be criminal not to walk down that story path after such a complete loss.  
---
With that said, there are "redemption" story lines that don't have to bring the Commander back to being the one in charge of everything, but could at least reenstate people's belief in us:  
---
1. The very real world "wtf went wrong" inquests and witch hunts that the Commander will be easy fodder for will have to be played out.  This level of BS is so deeply ingrained into IRL human nature that the story would lose a lot of simple credibility by not including this or trying to gloss over it.  It will get bonus points if every group involved has their cultural personality stamped clearly on their reactions... This is basically what caused Destiny's Edge to fall apart, and would be something each group, and each member of said groups by race (since GW2 races are basically accentuated slices of irl humanity) would have strong feelings about... potentially causing rifts within the organizations.  This could become a story-line black hole, and I would not be saddended to see the large group break-up/cry-baby stories be glossed over after witch hunting season is over.  
---
2. First place I'd go is straight to Glint.  Even before Ogden because it sounds as though what he knew came from her anyway.  She may be dead but that hasn't stopped her from continuing to meddle in the affairs of Tyria and if anyone has explaining to do, it's going to be her... If only to answer "Why were we not told about this?  OH WHAT was this a part of the great plan? A LITTLE HEADS UP WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE &amp;@$#%" (Don't EVER trust prophets.)  
---
3. Second thing that needs answering are the visions/avatars that briefly surrounded Kralk in the fight.  Were we the only ones to see those?  If we were, does that mean we are now officially Ascended?  Was Kralk using some form of Revenant magic and do we ask Rytlock about this?  Seeking answers to these questions is going to have to be a part of how we answer for our defeat.   
---
4. We're going to have to deal with the "Aurene situation."  Is she coming back by channeling Joko the way we just watched her granddaddy do with 2 other elder dragons and a twice-former god?  Or are we going to try yet another replacement scheme in the form of beings like the human gods?  Or will we find out that the prophecey was a lie?  We can't take another stab at Kralk until we have an answer for this, and whether that comes from Glint or somewhere else remains to be seen.  
---
Not listening *lalalalala*
---
Then just don't delete the reason, or stop deleting so many posts, it's like cause ans consequence have shifted places.
---
Downsides to getting in now: the oldest content is the stuff you're gonna see the most of at first. Itll take you a while. To get to anything that was made in the last 4 years (with a few exceptions).
---
Upsides to getting in now: still not too late. A major patch was released last week and the game is fairly active. 
---
Welcome!
---
Anet never intended for raiding to be done with pugs in the first place.
---
I dont see this as an issue. If group doesnt fill or wipe a lot I leave as well.
---
Slotting in a piece or two of Soldiers (or other defensive item) in an otherwise Berserker set is fine.
---
Just remember you're basically trying to buy yourself a +1 hit buffer to make timing active defenses easier or get an extra moment to get an ability to kill an opponent, not actually be able to eat sustained damage.
---
How good is this for mostly solo play? Running Scepter/Horn Fresh air right now for the AOE
---
Here’s is what you do. Use your lvl 80 character from HoT to get your raptor then start a new character and play e game normally but with your raptor and have fun. Don’t delete your lvl 80 and use the next boost on a 3rd character after you manually get to 80 on your main

Waylord\_Jenkins needs to stop his unceasing and intense, obvious lying. On the skyrim and gaming subreddits he is constantly shitposting reposts of what his "mom did". The claiming of other people's hard work for your own karma numbers isn't justifiable, it just contributes to a reddit which disregards the toil of a true artist. A few examples:
---

No, I'm the commander.
---
Yep
---
The overlaid color is slightly transparent, so it kind of depends on what armor and dyes you're using.
---
I have the red one, which tends to go kind of sickly orange sometimes if I mess with my dyes a lot.
---
Since when does "casual" as a word have such a vague meaning. It's like one of those words people throw around a lot to the point it simply loses its meaning, lately it happened to so many words.
---
Isn't a "casual" player a player that actually plays casually, occasionally that is, someone who enjoys the game say 1 hour a week and then leaves it be because they have other stuff. Wasn't this the so called "casual" player of the past? How is everyone a casual now.
---
Yeah I tend to get pissed at people who “know the fight” but drop poison in shit areas.
---
If you want to do the best condition damage, you want the Mace/Axe and the Shortbow on the Renegade. Personally, I like the staff too so Rev is one of the few classes I play Power on. Plus I got mine dressed up like a Dervish, really brings some nostalgia to it.
---
&gt;from doing the post-story current events
---
&gt;it’s not quite as simple as ‘finish HoT and you get it’
---
Well done

Hey man here's my moms Instagram page for proof I'm just proud of her work and want to share it that's all. https://instagram.com/bex_was_here?utm_source=ig_profile_share&amp;igshid=zhdk2bxm8bxt
---
The bulk of the game at this point is actually based around max level "end game" content. 
---
Once you get to 80, there's a few things available to you
---
1) classic PvE end game, raids and fractals (dungeons). Fractals are 5 man instances, raids are 10 man instances. 
---
We currently have 20 different fractals, repeated between 100 different levels, split up into 4 difficulty tiers. If you look on this sub somewhere, you should be able to find a fractal zero to fractal hero guide that goes over what fractals are
---
For raids, these are expansion only content, with a total of 6 having been released. The first 4 are locked behind the first expansion, HoT, and the most recent 2 are from PoF
---
2) PvP/WvW. While these can be accessed effectively at any time so long as you have reached the level, I still want to put it here anyways. sPvP isn't level restricted, and it's all normalized so that's not as big of a deal, but WvW does take gear stats into consideration so many people do WvW after reaching level cap and gearing up properly
---
3) The mastery system: This is a progression system that takes place after reaching level 80. These masteries do things like let you craft legendary weapons, or give you an autoloot feature, or give you enhanced ability when you're on a mount, etc. There are somewhere between 280-290 total mastery levels available if I remember correctly, and more get added with each living world release and expansion.
---
4) story. Once you get past the core story at level 80, you dip your toe into the expansion and living world stories, which are all based around level 80 characters.
---
5) Kind of an extension of the core game, the exploration and map completion of expansion maps. The expansions are notably more difficult than the core game, and autoattacking your way to victory is really not advised. Along with that, some maps just have more events and more large scale metas than you'd find in the core game.
---
Positives: lots of variety of things that you can choose to do
---
Negatives: In terms of traditional end game content (raids, dungeons), Anet only really releases a new one every 3-4 months, so for many people that gets kind of slow.
---
Can you stand somewhere else? :o
---
Provided you already have the weaponsmithing maxed, it's actually much better to craft ascended. The Dark Harvest collection requires you to unlock stuff from Dragon Stand vendors and purchase with currency. You're also tasked with opening noxious pods for some of the items in the collection. Then you have to craft oiled components and even craft and soulbind a mystic greatsword that costs between 40-60k for the collection. So, if you don't have the ability to craft some of the components, it might be even more tedious.   
---
In my opinion, the collection feels arbitrary since you're really just paying a ton for the mystic item to complete the associated achievement. I can understand their desire to balance costs of ascended and not make the items worthless by making it too easy to get them for each account, but it hardly feels like a reward when you basically have to pay for it with the equivalent in gold as any other ascended to craft. I would just suggest leveling crafting up to 500 because it will be more cost-effective in the long run.
---
Good job, Tybalt.
---
Thank you commander. 
---
Expansions are currently on sale 50% (it ends tonight, but sales are every 3/4 months when Living World uptades). But if you want to get the full story, you'll have to buy "Living World Seasons" (Season 1 is not playable anymore but you can watch a playthrough). We are currently in late Season 4.
---
"Season 2/3 Complete Pack" can be buy on the official website (16€) or (occasionaly) IG for about 1200 gems (10€, using InstantGaming gems code).
---
A living world episode is automaticly unlocked for free if you have all expansions and are connected as it's the latest released (every 3/4 months).
---
It take hundreds of hours to get to expansions if you to rush the game and just enjoy. Narration is getting better and better. Like, WAY better.
---
Looting is not really a very interresting part of GW2. For most of the time, you'll want to buy your stuff to Black Lion Trading Company, with IG money (mobs drop, dropped stuff reselled on BLTC, quests).
---
Dynamic events, Personal story and Living World certainly are. PvP too. But I'm more a PvE guy.
---
Not very clear i guess + bad english + smartphone keyboard. Feel free to ask more Qs.
---
For me it depends on the nature of the wipe.  If there's a few leeches in the group that clearly have zero idea what they are doing and either directly causing wipes or just making the fight incredibly long I will leave if they don't leave first or are kicked.  If the group just barely fails I will stick around for a bit however.  If we are doing a full clear and the first few bosses were a clown fiesta I will leave before the end boss because I just know it will be horrible and a giant waste of my time.  I don't usually flame though I'll whisper the commander and tell them I'm going to leave and why OR I'll type in chat "gl on XXXXXX, thanks for YYYYY" if I'm leaving after a boss.  If most of the group and/or the commander is bad I'll just type "gl on XXXXXX" and leave.  I refuse to stay in a group more than 1 pull with a trash commander because they obviously made the group to leech and I won't be a part of getting them their kill.
---
Congrats my dude. I actually have the GW2 CD somewhere in my collection. Got it a few years ago for Christmas and never really got into it at the time because I was expecting GW1. Quite familiar with MMORPGs and current player of WoW so I’ve been toying with the idea of giving GW2 an honest shot this time. Any recommendations on class/race combos and professions (if there are any in the game that let you craft your own items).  
---
Awesome stuff. Is there a holosmith one? Usually I just use my scrapper PvP build for open world and story. I felt like Holo didn't provide enough for open world. 
---
they could stretch the kralk fight or if it's tru we're going to the charr homelands it copuld be the flame legion, renegades or  Imperator Bangar Ruinbringer (who's been hinted to become a vilain for a while now)
---
Technically our break from the big bois JUST ended.
---
To be honest, unless Cantha invades or something, we have no obvious villains, so I am curious to see who shows up next
---
"Multi-boxing may ONLY be used in PvE areas. You are not permitted to run multiple accounts simultaneously in PvP, WvW, activities, or in other competitive environments."

Color is subjective. I'd call this pink. Magenta, maybe. Not purple.

its so funny. ppl who post in these kinds of threads always think they are never the problem and "very good". :D
---
Female Mesmer, black or white FoW armour, Torment Staff and Chaos Gloves.

Ready to energy surge  and spiritual pain pew pew
---
This is a great build. Thanks for showing me this!

As a Warrior, you don't really need the elite specializations to solo content in open world; core Warrior works just fine. Strength, Disc, Def, are good traitlines to go into. Bring GS and Axe/Axe (mace and shield work well if CC is needed). GS2 and Axe5 work very well for bursting down mobs and higher HP opponents. You can actually run more offensive gear (like Berserker or Marauder) because you have a high base HP and good defensive traits and skills. Defiant Stance is a good heal; you will absorb attacks, so this is good to use before opponents burst on you. Endure Pain will also absorb damage. If condition damage is what is killing you, Healing Signet is a strong passive heal that grants resistance on active. Berserker Stance also grants resistance and increased adrenaline for more burst attacks. Use positioning to force enemies to come to you (instead of standing in the open where you can be range attacked). Use your burst skills and GS2 and Axe5 to burst down enemies in melee very quickly. Your high HP and whichever defensive skills you take WILL keep you up. Warrior is also a great support class, so don't be afraid to ask for help when needed, as you can buff your allies with Banners and Tactics traitline, all the while doing significant DPS. Good luck fellow Warrior!
---
Actually this is the 1st time I watch the trailer.
---
Gear that gives a bonus to power. If you have the choice between a greatsword that gives +10 to power and one that gives +10 to toughness, choose the one with power on it. Power increases physical damage. For most of PvE, especially casual open-world PvE, going all in on damage is the most effective way to go. That means power, precision (crit chance), ferocity (crit damage), or condition damage and expertise (condition duration) if your build deals out a lot of damaging conditions like bleeding and burning.
---
post Kralk will probably not be another dragon related thing as there aren't really many dragons of concern left that know of.  I could see more Mists play or new regions to set some storylines in since we've been on this Kralk kick for a season and potentially another season if LS5 will be the Kralk-Resolve arc.
---
It is not the hue that is the issue, it is that it looks totally weird in the picture. 
---
And what do you want to tell us with this?
---
Oh, was writing on mobile and it somehow put wrong text in the quote. Will edit.
---
Ohhhh man I really hope so. Some of my favorite moments in Game of Thrones are the little personal arcs for important characters. As things get more and more grand and events fly by like the wind it gets harder to invest myself when things are so massive in scope. It's why I enjoyed GW1 so much. Some of it was grand, sure, like fighting Abaddon. So much of it felt personal. Or like the difference between Mass Effect 2 and 3. So much of 2 was so personal, just you and your squad on your little suicide mission, no one would have known if you failed but everything hinged on you succeeding. 
---
I know that Aurene was sort of that attempt to keep the commander's player immersed, to continue making all of this personal rather than just being a hero, but at times I felt that fell short. It felt forced that the commander was supposedly supposed to actually bond with this creature, because the narrative dictated so. I didn't shed my sorrow at the end of the episode because Aurene was dead, but because of how the other characters reacted. Taimi's VA nailed it, and that hopeless question from Braham really drove the emotion home. Because I am invested in those characters. It might just be me, but I never got invested in Aurene like the story was seeming to drive. I saw her as a means to an end. And now with her gone, the story was driving that she was our only hope and now she's gone.
---
All good. Wanted to make sure there wasn’t confusion. 
---
&gt; PvE areas
---
I feel like this still may need some clarification as to whether this means 'open world only' or if dungeons and raids also count as PvE for the purpose of the policy.
---
&gt;  I could not help see how slow-paced the game is
---
So is chess.
---
If you are a "Multi-Boxer" then this information could be very usfull for u!
---
For both of these, I feel like it was omission/error rather than design choices.
---
That and I remember Felicia saying that she'd like to do the voice again. It feels more like ANet just doesn't know what they should do with the character and prefer to not do anything at all instead of doing it half-assed.
---
Tybalt, introduction

Yes, commander

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:  
---
* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)

Now get out there and make the Order proud.
---
But this news is 4 days old and was already discussed.
---
One shot, one kill.
---
I have a feeling we'll decide it's better to attack a sleeping dragon rather than risk fighting another fully-caffeinated one.

Even if the plot twists resolve a lot of player worry from the end of this episode, I wouldn't be surprised if some "Let's go for the easy target" talk came up... And then immediately goes wrong, for dramatic effect once LS5 starts.
---
If it isn't WvW or PvP, it's PvE.
---
I would consider dungeon and raids as pve content.
---
I'm assuming they meant no pvp context because they don't want people to skew the games.
---
The expansions are on sale quite often and are definitely worth picking up. Lots of great content is available for a relatively low price. As for the learning curve, I would say there is very little. It is pretty easy to get into endgame content. Gearing for that content can be time consuming, but is not absolutely required. There is absolutely some time required to get good at the activity, but this should be expected of any game. I recommend maining 1 class and getting to 80 and unlocked elite specializations on that class. After that, you should have a solid understanding of that class and it's role in certain content. As for being late, new content is being released all of the time (kinda), so you're never too late or that far behind where everyone else is. You will definitely catch up quicker than you think!
---
Just gear with power as it's first stat. As a newbie it isn't too important to use exactly the most efficient combination, only stack power for the moment.
---
Yep, I stood on it.
---
I got it, so it def works, but I did it during the last fight of the instance on accident. I was just kinda kiting the mobs during the phases where the boss is flying around and you can't hit them and throwin spears every once in a while and it just popped. Try that I guess?
---
Ha, I was there! I was very confused. Someone said, "Stop using the party infusions. That's our intestines you monster!"
---
4 days old.. but I didn't read this before.
---
So not important for you, important for some.. especially if they mostly Reddit and not fourm.
---
where here on reddit? link pls!
---
Damn, didn't know WvW mode is forgotten and abandoned so much that even the game code itself doesn't know how to run it properly anymore.
---
Welcome to the game! You're in for a blast! If you have any questions, I would highly recommend map chat while in-game, or our weekly question thread on the subreddit. 
---
Warriors are a ton of fun, and probably one of, if not, the easiest class to get a hang of the game. Please play around with different skill and weapon combinations, and avoid looking up "builds" while leveling. And do everything! It all gives experience, from exploring to crafting to gathering to killing, you'll never be in short supply of things to do. 
---
&gt; I wonder who will wake the next dragon. There is no villain who does it. Unless the next dragon magically awakens without explanation.
---
The Elder Dragons don't need villains to wake them up; they are typically awoken in cycles when the ambient magic levels reach critical levels. While they are sleeping, their minions and champions typically work to collect magic in their stead. To that end, Scarlet (essentially being one of the first awakened champion for Mordremoth) did exactly what she was supposed to do; provided him with a shot of magic caffeine to fully wake him up.
---
There are many avenues that the story *could* take that involve the EDs as a primary or secondary threat.
---
Primordus and Jormag are currently back in a "hibernation state", but Anet could form any number of reasons to wake them back up as an excuse to travel into the Far Shiverpeaks or Depths of Tyria. Selbbub is also awake but a massive unknown at the moment and could force the story in that direction should they choose.
---
Provided things stay calm after Kralky's defeat, the story could focus on expanding the "mortal races" threats; things like the animosity rising with the Blood Legion Charr in the Homelands, the xenophobic isolation of Cantha, or return the story to the exodus of the Gods. 
---
Lyssa remains a big question mark as far as her motives are concerned; the fact that Balthazar didn't mention her when he angrily cursed the other Gods and used a tool of hers to disguise himself, despite the fact that she was mentioned by Kormir as being among those who voted to cast Balth down from godhood. If the story trends back towards the gods, you can bet she's going to be at the forefront of the story.

---
I really do hope so, but with no word on it so far, I'm not sure
---
 Polysaturating Reverberating Infusion (Magenta) 
---
Remember that these policies are published only to cover Anet's ass. They very rarely if ever care to check. Especially in pvp where dev team is smaller than their forums team.
---
No it's not hard, but if I had the means I'd just send you one to use it on a condition that after two weeks you have to destroy it. Permanently. I'd be more than interested in your opinion after that.
---
Also, some people tend to be very conscious about efficiency. For example a very good friend of mine invested in a NVME SSD. Then he actually calculated that the time he saves on loading times, will recoup the time he invested in researching the best available drive for his use case in 2 months. It is a bit extreme, but he has a valid point.
---
Now let's translate that on time saved not having to switch maps to access the bank/merchant/tp... That time can be spent on farming (thus boosting income), or going to raids while not wasting others time due to not having the correct food and leaving the instance for bank access. (No, I'm not saying a perma bank would be mandatory for raids.)
---
God I hope no more dragons.  It's just getting old imo.  Although this episode was done well imo.
---
Go to bloodstone fen and every now and then it will change to a similar color. I love how it looks. Almost wish I’d stay that way over how it normally looks. 
---
I have a chair
---
Thanks everyone for the quick responses. I cant wait to get off work and try it out tonight!  
---
I'm not super new, but I take extended breaks from the game. Plan to come back after my internet gets turned on. (Just moved houses).
---
What's your discord?
---
Which one is "the first heart" and how far south?
---
I tried Condi Renegade for a while, full Viper's gear, but I found the ramp-up to be sooo long and DPS not all that great, compared to something like a Condi Berserker, or Firebrand.
---
With the introduction of Diviner's stats to PvE, I've taken a couple pieces of that, along with mostly Harrier's, to built out a Glint/Ventari Herald, dual swords &amp; staff, and I've really been having fun with that! I like the play-style of managing facets, and it's interesting to focus more on supporting allies than doing maximum DPS. I will probably switch it back to Renegade again soon, to dish out lots of alacrity.
---
But, if you have the resources to invest in the condi gear (or already have some), it's probably worth trying out! Maybe I just never got the hang of it.. but there is definitely a long ramp-up time, with Torment being the main focus of the build. Thematically, I really like it, but it just feels like it doesn't do enough damage to enemies, probably because their AI typically prefers to stand still when fighting.
---
It depends on the class and the activity. In some cases, elite specs are much better than their core counterparts. However, in some circumstances, the core classes are very good and even meta. If you have the expansions, then switching between core and elite specializations is easy and free, and there is no penalty for learning to play both. As a Warrior main, I play Core Warrior in FotM, Berserker in most raids, and Spellbreaker (RIP) in WvW and PvP. Depending on what game modes you play, you will find that playing a certain way will be better or worse.

---
I went up and stood on the railing of the platform behind the table because as an asura I was still too short on just the table.
---
Just because it doesn't need to be used or it is not optimal doesn't mean it is not there. It is only really necessary for raids or T4 fractals, but you can bring healers anywhere. You still can't really build for control.
---
On the contrary of the most of comments I believe it won't go this way.
---
Whole Joko arc would be meaningless. Aurene eating Joko is the chekovs gun. It must kaboom.
---
If even Gwen is fighting in the mists along with other ghosts and coming just to warn us, no hope is lost.
---
My favorite is when you find a rare training PUG, and you get the boss to 16% on the first try, but then one exp raider who joined says "obv this is not happening" and then leaves. 
---
yeah ok, thats about all Policies but ok.
---
Do not be afraid to use the 80 boost **if you get bored**. Some people have more fun in the later game content than early game.
---
It feels like whoever was responsible for managing this episode didn't do his job. This is 6 year old game and such mistakes happen all the time. Does zadorojny even direct this game?
---
Aah, but then I worry that iconic moments in NEW story releases, or OLD story releases, get replaced. D: I really just don't like OG Guild War's music, its too... light? Something about the tone bores the hell out of me.
---
Have fun. Really though for $30 total with the base game plus 2 xpacks you have a couple thousand hours to look forward to easily. It's a steal.
---
Defense traitline can help a lot, especially the one that heals you after using burst.
---
Reality is often disappointing
---
So, it looks like Hosts Of Avalon is the only audio one going? As sparadic as they are right now.
---
Besides Kralk I think another of Gods (looking at you Lyssa) and the Deep Sea Dragon are the most high potential villains atm.
---
Although honoustly, I wouldn't be surprised if we're still far form done with Kralk.
---
It's always been an issue, not sure if it's gotten worse though, as I don't use shoulders on most of my heavy toons.
---
fucked if i know but for ruinbringer he could try and twist the pact (lead by a human) attacking kralk in charr lands (or trying to at least) as a act of war of some sorts (from his description he seems to be looking for an excuse to fight the humans on top of being an unreasonable hothead)
---
You dropped the precursor. You don't need to do the vol1 2 and 3 stuff.... Doing those gives you an account bound dusk at the end of completing them. If you really wanted to you could make a second one by completing the tasks in volume 1 this will then unlock the ability to buy volume 2 complete that and so on.
---
Tldr
---
Account bound precursor obtained from completing legendary journey.
---
Non account bound precursor obtained by lucky loot drop or pur hashing from the tp
---
that'd just be stupid
---
If you have dusk,  why are you attempting to craft it? The volume items are part of the process to craft dusk itself.  
---
You want to look at the mystic forge recipe for twilight. 
---
It's not nonsense, it is exactly what they said when they launched them.
---
No need for the personal attack kiddo.
---
Once you bought the first volume of Twilight, you should have unlocked an achievement called, [Twilight I: The Experimental Nightsword](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Twilight_I:_The_Experimental_Nightsword) you must complete it and only then you will be able to buy the second volume, which will unlock the second part.
---
thanks, made point 3  a bit clearer now :)
---
How come? I mean, it seems like a reasonable solution given the circumstances. 
---
you're so committed to shit on every single post mentioning aurene's revival, it's incredible!
---
Have you ever played a charr? They get that with EVERY single piece. Its annoying, but at least there are a decent amount of skins that are formed in a way that you don't see it that obviously.
---
No clue, maybe they did annoy people mercilessly or maybe their positioning got lost along the way
---
At this point they kind of have to, in my opinion at least. For the last few years we've been on a steady course of rising action, with each major story chunk ending in some cliffhanger, plot twist or tragic victory, and the narrative is rapidly running out of believability - if it hasn't run out already. Eventually it will reach a point where the player base simply can't accept that the stakes can be raised any higher, and any attempt to do so will completely shatter our suspension of disbelief; killing Aurene at the end of this latest episode came dangerously close to that threshold, perhaps even crossing it for some players.
---
They need to take at least at least an episode or two to reduce the tension, resolve the current plot and let us catch our breath before introducing the next big thing, so that it can start at a lower level of intensity before building up to the next Elder Dragon, something that hasn't happened in the story since we killed Zhaitan. That, and introducing some new threat right at the end of S4, in addition to resolving the Aurene situation and finishing off Kralky, would force them to either make said episode absolutely massive (which I could totally get behind, assuming they did a good job of it) or not give some aspects the attention they need - even fitting two of those three plot points into one episode would be a tight fit if not handled very carefully. The best thing they can do is use S4E6 to resolve the current arcs and end on a high note, then introduce a new, less-intense threat over the course of S5E1; I just hope they manage to pull it off, and we don't have to wait until late April or even early May to get it.
---
What did you feel like Holo was lacking? I'm running inventions+tools static discharge build with pistol/shield and have no real issues doing any kind of content. Pistol obviously doesn't do a whole lot of damage but shield give you a very high amount of survivability and Holo provides all the damage you need. 
---
I'm probably completely wrong on this, and I am not trying to troll either. I'm not understanding why this is so important to some players. If anybody could please explain I would love here from somebody who feels that this is important, and of enough importance to possibly leave the game over.
---
that's no excuse to be lazy about it
---
[It could be worse.](http://gucomics.com/20070919)
---
Yes I saw that too. But that blast was very devastating. I am not counting her out yet but she has the highest probability of being dead.
---
My favourite is elementalist. I was drawn to the token sorcerer like class of controlling the elements. It is squishy, so if you ever try the elementalist, either stick to it to learn how to survive, or pick a class that has more sustain to teach you the game. It has challenge so don’t get frustrated if it doesn’t click right away.
---
I picked warrior when i first started because i wanted dual swords and its been my main ever since. Warrior is really fun because you get a vast variety of options for weapons to use, which is a big part of play in the game, so you can pick something you find fun. 
---
That said ive been having a lot of fun with revenant lately, its such a fun class to play, and look visually pretty and flows really well.
---
I was the 2nd person in the room, and had to fight the graveling a dozen times, watching people come in after I halfway killed it and getting the plate and leaving
---
It is not lazy, it is just an easy out.
---
Would fit the grimness that is gw lore in all honesty.
---
I stood up at the top of the stairs
---
pretty much always and other non-human races also have issues: charr is the most known cuz of tail clipping and other such things but also sylvari legs are oddly wide with some pieces..and yea norn floaty shoulders!
---
personally i could find only very few chest/shoulders pieces that fit on norn medium..for heavy i pretty much gave up and use outfits exclusively
---
Actually it can be done really fast by talking to a few people.
---
I talked with everyone because I wanted to hear the dialogues.
---
A solitary asura by the southern ruins south of the second bounty board is particularly funny.
---
LOK'TAR OGAR
---
Come on, not every story can start with an elaborate murder-orgy on an exploding giant mecha IN SPACE!
---
Don't have too many complaints on my sylvari tbh, but then again i'm medium armor
---
GW2 generally speaking is less about being able to absorb damage and more about speeding up the tempo of the fight as much as possible. In other words, maximizing how much damage you deal (either burst or sustained) at the expense of survivability, since the point is to kill things before they kill you in any case. So try to avoid slowing your damage output since it means your enemies also get to live longer.
---
It also basically means that the amount of damage you should expect to take is roughly proportional to how many mistakes you make while in combat.
---
For Raids, this is basically the law of the land. That's why the superior builds are all focused on max damage output. You learn the mechanics, try to avoid falling victim to them through intelligent positioning and proper timing of dodges, self-heals, blocks, etc. 
---
I've noticed that in open world PVE, the more damage you can deal to large areas of effect, the easier it is to survive, since you often run into multiple enemies at once. And of course, positioning yourself so that you are not drawing aggression from more enemies than you're equipped to handle is critical to not dying.
---
Warriors have a decent base health pool. Almost twice as high as that of Guardians, for example. And they are a heavy armor class. So they can survive melee combat more easily than some other classes. Still, the more up close you are to enemies, the faster you need to react in terms of changing position and dodging. It's why longbow berserker warrior is a good open world PVE build — if things get dicey you make some distance and let fly with a high-dps longbow rotation that should just kill anything that's not a veteran. For a good rotation, look at Snow Crows' site, specifically at their page on condition berserker warrior. (Yes the rotation is assumed melee, and incorporates alternating with sword/torch, but with multiple targets and being by yourself a lot in open world PVE, controlling distance from enemies is pretty vital so you'll need to tweak on the fly.)
---
Power builds can work well if they are properly equipped. But you're in a bit more danger and need to be skill up as far as when to use your heal, when to move away, etc. I often run a base axe/axe build that mows things down.
---
Yes, a good warrior will be alright traveling solo in Tangled Depths, or anywhere for that matter. Though some enemies are especially dangerous if your tactics are wrong, and you have to equip for them (some require lots of CC, others are much less dangerous at range so you want cripples etc.). 
---
I've died a lot... typing /deaths gives me a very big number... but I'm at the point where I typically know precisely how I misplayed and therefore died. At no point do I consider going with higher toughness or vitality as the appropriate adjustment.
---
WvW.. that is a little different. There, I run a Spellbreaker with full Marauders right now. Damage can be so quick that the extra vitality can make the difference for me as to whether or not I have a positive effect on a fight. But there too, the reason Marauders is a good choice for some folks is that it doesn't compromise damage output quite as much as other alternatives.
---
As someone mentioned earlier, the crafting process is only for the precursor which you already have. Please refer to the wiki for legendary crafting:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Twilight
---
I'm wondering if WvW Roaming is worth coming back to. I'm thinking about coming back to GW2, mainly to have some fun roaming in WvW. But I'm a bit concerned about the state of WvW and PvP as a whole... A few balance patches have hit since I stopped playing, so I don't know how's the balance nowadays.
---
See, when I watch these roaming montage videos, I can't help but want to play GW2 again. But like, I'm not sure if they really portray the reality of the game. Maybe reality is walking around for 20 minutes until I finally get to duel someone, only to be one shot in less than 0.5s by a Mesmer.
---
I don't get how people go 1vsX in those videos when all it takes is one cancer build to one shot you. Yes, you can dodge, sure. But having to react extremely fast, specially considering that I play on 150 ping, only to not instantly die by default is NOT how it should be. But hey, I'm no pro, maybe its a "get gud" problem. I would love to hear from WvW veterans.
---
So I'm wondering if I'm gonna be able to enjoy myself roaming in WvW nowadays.
---
Thanks in advance.
---
Well its like any other issue someone has with the game, but never said anything about leaving the game over it.  If your focus and enjoyment in the game is fashion, fashion collecting, and making many different wardrobe styles, then it's an issue for you.  If you care more about fractals then your issue might be the recent instabilities.  If you care a lot about the story and lore then you might complain about story direction.  GW2 is many things to different people.  
---
Love it.
---
Lose the chaos gloves and replace with something more drab by/spooky

Talking in a story? That's just bad writing.

how did he get hinted? genuine question
---
“Gtfo with this nonsense” sounds to me more like it’s referring to it being there 3 days in a row. 
---
Even so the comment still doesn’t  say that it’s too hard just that they dislike the instability. Meaning your original comment was telling him to try lower scales as if 100cm is the direct problem in question and not slippery slope, which may I remind you, can also appear on lower scales.
---
You are making it sound like 100cm was the problem instead of slippery slope which is just plain wrong.
---
Yeah agreed. I think that would be rly cool. 
---
I heard the revenant is kinda hard to learn for a newbie? Is that true?
---
then what would you consider lazy writing. cuz giving an easy, convenient, ass-pull of a way out is exactly lazy writing from my perspective
---
Antarctica is a desert.
---
You can just ask in map chat or lfg if someone can help you. Gw2 has a great community, there a plenty of people that are willing to help if you just ask.
---
Last I checked the dead house meta was still done quite frequently (a couple weeks ago) so it shouldn’t be too hard. On the other hand though just stealth it out.
---
Engineer. Pretty versatile class and got lots of fun mechanics to it, plus the elite spec holosmith is insanely fun once you get around to it 
---
They're actually more like extremely violent anthropomorphic cacti.
---
I was making a generalization about leaving the game, which I've seen in similar posts not this one in particular. I guess because I don't focus in on small details in a game I struggle to see the importance of the fashion aspect. I ask myself one question about every game I play: is it fun? If yes keep playing, if no adios.
---
On which map do you go ? Obsidian sanctum is a jumping puzzle so you won't find many people :D
---
Can you see commander tags on your map ? If yes, join them and you'll find where people are.
---
Otherwise, try asking on map chat.  
---
I've seen the choya and I think theyre fucking great! But those look like pinata choya holding balloons
---
Yeah Norn shoulder pieces are BONKERS huge!  I don't understand why it was done this way.
---
it doesnt matter who does this, they don't do it anyway
---
As others said power is the best stat to increase direct dmg. U will also find precision  stat (critical chance) and ferocity (critical damage) but u dont have to worry about those until u hit lvl 80 and start gearing for some serious stuff. It will accelerate your lvling by making you kill stuff faster. There are also sigils which can be socketed in your weapons and runes that can be socketed in your armor. Sigil of BLOOLUST is especially good for lvling cause it increases your power by a whole lot every time u kill something. The bonus stays until u down or change map. Once u have some armor u can also take some major quality runes to also help with damage, keep it cheap though, no point spending lots of money on gear until lvl 80.
---
Food/utilities are consumables that either give some special property or flat out increase your stats till they run out. Most of them also give a bonus to xp so its another cheap way to make your lvling faster and smoother. 
---
U will eventually figure stuff out for yourself and u can always try whatever u want regardless of what me or anyone else says in this post The lvling experience in GW2 is miles ahead of any other mmo. Just keep it cheap and save gold for when u need to properly gear your character (after lvl 80).
---
I don't doubt that those happen often. The statement your quoting was just a general statement about those who just want to clear it fast and not waste time so they can do something else. Sorry I should have been more clear on that. However I like the idea of working with others to try something different and it is good to hear that off comps do work, you just have to play the fight right (to put it in simple terms if I read that right). Honestly I believe the people that are all Meta or you are kicked are just the minority and it just so happens they are the loudest so it is what you hear the most about when trying to get into raids. 
---
Personally this is just all my outside looking in perspective. I'm trying to get into raids and only have done a few bosses. The people that scream meta or nothing are primarily what I see on NA mainly because I believe the others already found their group and if they look for more it fill up fast.
---
Either way I'm certain once I get more experience in raids I will start to see the other side.
---
/r/GuildWarsDyeJob is the sub you're looking for
---
This is surprising to hear. Maybe you are on a red map and those are often devoid of defenders depending on the current state of the matchup.
---
Most nights, starting around 6 EST, you should find a lot of people on. TC used to be super busy (a few years ago) but I don't know about currently. Darkhaven is pretty busy right now. FA seems to always be busy. 
---
Mak sure that when you get to the map, type /m to say hi to people on the map and join a tag... that should get you going. (look for the colored dorito on the map, and right-click... then join)
---
there's so many fucking bugs that have been around for literally years that they have paid 0 attention to
---
And it's usually people who'll tell you here and ingame, that they know every encounter by heart, have 400+ LI and 80KP for W7 already, because they are not some casual like you /s
---
That's why I don't even bother to join high LI groups, it takes way too god damn long to find 10 people of which 3 leave after the first pull.
---
I never considered raiding "toxic" or the people "elitist", but fuck those particular  people with a burning stick.
---
Looks like a rotting mushroom growing out of a tree.
---
To complete the look, you should use more claw-like or plant-like gloves. Like those of cultural armor, arah armor, dry bones armor, or toxic gloves.

Awesome thank you for the heads up! 
---
Oh yeah, that's the pinata choya tonic. I thought you meant you hadn't gotten to the PoF areas with Choya.

---
Would you suggest using the boost, and still playing through the story? Or is it better to try and find a re-cap online?
---
I've been playing almost exclusively as a solo player since launch and have quite a bit of fun. The only things I really \*feel\* like I'm missing out on our raids, but, there is plenty other things to keep me busy.
---
The oil collection bar disappears after the event is complete, so you have no opportunity to hold on to it for the slug fight
---
Try bladed armor, chak weapons. Twilight armor
---
I play mostly Charr, but have a couple humans, and on the rare occasion that I decide a human needs a new look I'm always amazed by how good everything looks. There's no scrambling to mix and match, no clicking through every option in the wardrobe to find something that fits, everything just fits and it's simply a matter of finding something to my taste. With Charr it's a struggle to find the few options that actually look okay and then picking the one I hate least. 
---
I'd love to see a return to something like the Domain of Anguish. Something evil is rounding up dark forces in the mists, and an army of demons is starting to pour in. Maybe even tie it into the unstable rifts.
---
I think you'll soon realize how nice this community can be. One of the nicest communities I've ever experienced.
---
I play a lot of Overwatch and I dipped my toes into League of Legends and compared to them this community is godlike.
---
Welcome to the game man. 
---
I totally agree!  One of the things I love about GW2 is how much it encourages player interaction... but these anti-social mechanics are pretty much a step backward.
---
I will recommend ranger. It was also my first. It is quite beginner friendly for leveling, and it provides a number of different build choices at 80 and beyond. (power &lt;direct damage&gt;, condition &lt;damage over time&gt;, support/heal &lt;boons or buffing the party&gt;, and has a great deal of controlling abilities for break bar &lt;boss mechanic&gt; and crowd control. The pet acts as a good buffer for mistakes early on, but the profession offers a large great deal of complexity and often mobile gameplay. No matter what you choose, I suggest you try out all of the utilities, traits,  and weapons sets. Do not just stick to one weapon set, as it is good to learn what potential your kits have. Enjoy, I envy your first time experience! 
---
Thats one issue I'v had with games pretty much always, which comes from the fact that game doesn't really care how ridiculous you make armor or weapons look. I'm not one to breach historical accuracy, but I do think the optimal solution is somewhere in between. For example I love asoiaf art pieces like these:

How I wish, we had FF14 crafting in GW2. God I loved that system.  
---
Revenant is by far my favorite class! I love the Renegade elite spec and healing Renegade as well! Both are super fun for me. :)
---
you go there, find a map with commander and follow the tag around hitting stuff
---
there is the big meta, palawadan on a 2h timer which is the best gold..guide for pala: kill mobs, loot chests

there is a smaller meta called great hall or GH along with aki, books, caravan which are basically filler events between palawadan metas that aren't as rewarding but still good

They'll also do their best to make sure that you have to repurchase the game, if they can. I lost my account, as well, and even mailed them from the original email that bought the game. lol. GL getting your stuff back.
---
The only things that seem to fit Charr well, is the Charr cultural armor and Lyssa's Regalia outfit for some reason (without the headpiece).
---

As I recall the meta wasn't required for it.  There's a sand portal on the outside of the deadhouse towards the southeast that leads towards the MP and the rune chest.  It's a pain going through as there are about 3-4 portals and each room has traps and mobs.  I'd bring, stealth, shadowstep/shortbow 5 for mobility, an equipped jackal ready to go as soon as you're out of combat.  You'll get dismouted...alot, just keep going past mobs till you locate the next portal and be prepared to fight some of the mobs that have followed you to the portal.  The final room was the one with the MP and it also had the rune forge chest I believe, unfortunatly, there's some tough enemies there as well, stacked stealth through shadow refuge and the shortbow blast might buy you enough time to open the chest.

I don't want this, but anet never fails to disappoint 
---
Looks great! A change of gloves would be better, otherwise colors and outfit’s really good. I’m assuming that’s a Necromancer? ;)
---
All set!
---
Yes, totally agree. Forgot about that POI
---
That's it, thank you! I knew there was something that would imply it.
---
Pro Tip: Less Violence, More Violets
---
PS like Phalanx Strenght Ele? Lol
---
Are you saying that the branded resource nodes are server side?
---
Oh, no lol. Just never seen the tonic yet 😋
---
I think it depends on your definition of catastrophic. You can have relatively clean runs with horrendous support or vice versus on the easy bosses. That said, I leave after one pull if supports are bad. No point sticking around if you aren’t going to get the basic raid boons (quick,alac,fury,  20+ might)
---
Engineer is fun. You may not be able to switch weapons or get sigils, but you do get a lot of gadgets.
---
Except the tier 3 cloth cultural armor which never hasbeen modified for the charr tail.
---
&gt; What do I do now... 
---
Yeh, that's the biggest thing for me, lorewise. With the only "elder dragon replacement" possible gone, and Kralkatorrik likely wise to our plan now... What possible avenues *do* we still have open? 
---
Not to mention that the majority of the allied forces pre-battle were on the verge of panic - there's even a slightly comical achievement about hyping up one little asura appropriately, and three of the four hearts in the new map deal with getting the allied forces mentally ready to fight. 
---
I think if ANet's going where many of us think they're going, ep6 is gonna be pretty dark.
---
Edited. ^^ Thank you.
---
They already did make it so you can get the POI by standing at the gate. :)
---
Where’s the condition clear abilities for a Reaper?  I want to like Reaper but conditions bum me out.  I miss my Scourge’s F2 spam for condition clearing.  
---
No, they are client side, but the tuna lure/fishing spots at the south Dredge camp are server side, which makes completing the heart/doing the Star Fisher achievement very tedious
---
Wait till you strt noticing the massive calves but tiny feet on most boots.
---
I suppose he could, but how would the black citadel respond...? Would it be attacked by Ruinbringer in an attempted coup? So we get a new city layout for that place 😅 how would the other legions respond?
---
Personally I think the Elder Dragon drama has run its course.  The trick to writing a good story is knowing when to end it.
---
so you are saying the general description of him is a hint that it will/could be a villain for awhile now? or are there other bits of conversation in the recent content (s3/4) pointing to that possibility?
---
"PS" is just the term anyone uses for might-sharing, since that was basically Warrior's sole job for about 5 years until Druid's GotL got reworked.
---
If you enjoy the personal story, keep playing.
---
Not to bash on the personal story, but the story telling, plot, setting, character development etc. only goes up and up and up as the story goes on through the living world seasons and the expansions.
---
That helped me get it done, thank you! Especially to use SR around the chest so I'd have time to get it open.
---
Thanks! 😁
---
I really hope they keep Aurene dead. Resurrection would just make her death waste of time. Not to mention all the Joko business could be red herring, because her just popping up all good and healthy just sounds rather stupid, to me at least. 
---
Also as someone on GW forum put it " 
---
Joko doesn't come back from the dead.
---
Joko never dies.
---
Key difference.
---
Aurene dies."
---
, Aurene in this case is dead, even crystallized plant lady whose name at he moment escapes me, says that Aurene is gone.
---
The thing is, they've already established precisely that: it was stated (I believe explicitly, although I don't remember the exact dialogue) in S4E4 that, if not stopped pretty much immediately, Kralkatorrik would consume not just all the magic in Tyria, but the Mists as well, which is problematic seeing as the Mists are literally *made of magic*. We are, as of right now in the story, at the point where defeat would literally result in the destruction of reality itself. The narrative space is officially out of higher possible stakes, which means we really need to cool off a bit before introducing new antagonists, otherwise any possible conflict even the other Elder Dragons will feel harmless compared to what we just dealt with.
---
***Come, come! Light of Deldrimor big shiny! Big shiny equal big joy! Skritt math!***

Why would I? Its a typical cliched rah rah speech poorly voice acted.
---
there is quite a few more sets than that. but the god damn T3 helm is near unbeatable. do i want a scary facehelm and a huge fucking horn. Fuck yeah i do. ( i only know heavy armor charr stuffs )
---
Implying Anet never changes their stance on this lmao  
---
If they said that when W1 was released, then they sure as hell don't stand by that statement nowadays.  Just look at Bastion &amp; Mythwright Gambit.
---
then dont claim they rarely or ever hceck in pvp, simple as that
---
It might be easy to get the oil/mines achievements over time, but it is a bit unpleasant to feel like you're playing more against other players than the event for that kind of stuff. Plus, feedback like "be careful going this route" can be useful for future designs, so it doesn't get worse later on.
---
As for the graveling one I've been pretty lucky so far too, but always saw people struggling with it anytime I passed there.
---
Sorry, I must have phrased it poorly. I'm working on getting ascended gear for all my toons. I like those skins but not the stats the weapons come with. If I can change the stats on this weapon in the mystic forge then I'm good but if it's like the Caledbolg weapons and can't be changed I'll have to spend my mats elsewhere.
---
I'm sure you have legit reasons for being so jaded, but that said, you are a jaded motherfucker. 
---
Why are you even in this subreddit?
---
it's also the first PoF map without a bounty board.
---
i don't know but if they go that rout they've got time to explore the idea
---
it's his description for a while now but like i said, if we go to the charr homelands that story could finally get started and alot of ppl want some charr content 
---
Not an expert on deadeye pve but I'm running trickery, critical strikes and deadeye. 
---
Trickery: Thrill of the crime, Bountiful Theft &amp;
---
Quick Pockets
---
Critical Strikes: Twin Strikes, Practiced Tolerance, Invigorating Precision.
---
Deadeye: Malicious Intent, Slient Scope, Maleficent 7.
---
Feel free to shuffle traits around depending on the situation. For example you can switch Quick Pockets for Slight of Hand for extra cc, daze and reduced steal cooldown. Could even take Trickster if you're running elite like me. Or Invigorating Precision with No Quarter for more damage if you don't need the extra sustain. 
---
For gear I'm going all berserkers thanks to thief's high evasion rate but you can start with valkyries or marauder for more hp, until you feel comfortable. 
---
Utilies; signet of malice and signet of agility are staples in my opinion. The rest is up to you.
---
Hope this helps :)
---
Bring back human female idle animations
---
Reminded me the end of original Guild Wars campaigns. When you met all the people you've seen through the adventures once again. They just waited for you to come and talk with them. Like a farewell. Same feeling here, but just before the end this time. Not after. And when you reach that part, that's when you realize: "oh ok, it gonna be huge now".
---
sounds interesting, I basically have the full gear required (but atm I lack a character slot...), how difficult is to play effectively with this build? I'm a complete noob to mesmer btw
---
sure, mate. take less drugs, you idiot.
---
I had the same problem for a while. I have no idea what caused it, but I opened a support ticket. Eventually they got back to me saying they'd fixed it and I have no idea how but they had. So that would be my recommendation and the only way I'm aware of to fix this particular issue.
---
With those stats you do have more health but you take longer to kill mobs. The mobs have more time to do damage to you and when you fight kore tuan one mob, you may just be able to kill the first mob but the other mobs are still alive and finish you off. If you run full berserkers you can quickly decimate a mob before it has time to do that much damage to you. Because berserker has no defensive stats, you need to dodge or block the big telegraphed attacks and use stun breaks if you get cc'd.  
---
I finally learned why berserker or vipers are best for their respective damage roles when I tried using my condi burnbot firebrand with carrion armor in Thunderhead Peaks. I simply could not kill a single mob fast enough before its friends killed me. 
---
oooohhh..... yeah, didn't even notice that one. Bounties... weren't great. But I like my Griffons, so perhaps there were people who enjoyed Bounties. 
---
So nobody has any suggestions ?
---
Sad.
---
I had mailed them- they'd only responded with "they're looking into my purchase history and conduct a fix"
---
I've had this problem before and they'd resolved it for me; card works for a bit, then problem resumes again. 
---
ofc I did, I just question the ppl that always post in these kinds of threads and that they are always "not the problem" when it comes to instanced content. 
---
they are all the good and nice players, lol.
---
right?  doesn't condi rev have a weapon skill that drops like 10 stacks of torment onto an enemy?  or maybe it was 7?
---
still though!
---
Hmm, don't know what to tell you then, except that I hope they fix it permanently this time
---
Never said I expect Anet to do anything realistic. What I expect out of Anet is to discard any kind of consequence and move straight ahead to finding a way to bring Aurene back, especially considering the next team is technically the Crack in the Ice team which is marginally the weakest one when it comes to story.
---
What I wrote above is what I'd expect and what I'd like to see. Of course, that is far from what's going to happen.
---
And we're the Commander. Perhaps one day will come where we'll actually stop following orders and start issuing the orders instead. Y'know. Sit down, draw a thorough, well-thought plan instead of always diving in blindly. 
---
The thumbnail showed Raiden from MK.

In case anyone needs to be told HOLY SPOILERS ON THAT TUMBLER!
---
Welcome friend! Hope you enjoy your time, GW2 has one of the friendliest online communities out there. If ever you have questions just ask in chat and you'll get a ton of people popping up out of the woodwork to try to help you lol.
---
Not sure if anyone else has said this or not, but also try the chat command /wiki !
---
If you're not sure how something works or if you just wanna learn more about anything in the game, just type /wiki followed by whatever you want to learn more about! It's a super handy tool for new players or even experienced players, because there is SOOOOO MUCH content in this game lol.
---
Light sylvari male shoulders are pretty bad about floating and sizing issues.
---
Epic xD
---
Great. I know the Caledbolg weapons were exempt from this and I wanted to be sure before using up a ton of mats for an axe I wouldn't use.
---
The only way for them to fix this is put more time into tailoring armor for each race and the different body structures you can pick as much as they do humans. Unfortunately the only time they’ve EVER done that is with cultural armor and a few select sets maybe 
---
Well its gonna be hard if you know nothing about it. 
---
If you still know your account name and email you should be fine tho. 
---
Cant do more than wait for a response. They ll ask more detailed questions about your account like credit card info or date of account creation and such.
---
Gl
---
Its just a question of preference.. Some people like outfits and some others like skins. They can't just remove outfits...
---
I find it more infuriating as a male sylvari, where shoulders are scaled to norn shoulders so they float way off, yet male humans are fine.
---
They ded
---
With that grim look even the armor is scared and wants to get away =P
---
Thank you for the information. I was unaware of this as I was on the break from the game when Festival happened.
---
welcome to tyria commander
---
Ahahaha that's exactly what I thought! I'm a high master Overwatch player so I instantly noticed the difference between this great community and the other one :)
---
It is indeed. Thanks, i agree on the gloves. 
---
I stand with you on this but I'm actually sorta happy where we are now. We got 2 sets in a living world episode a while back, that's awesome. Before that they only came in expansions from what I could see. HOT had at least 3 same with POF. I'm fine with their costumes/outfits too because they're much easier to design than armor pieces, it's been all explained before. While I do love to mix and match, I like a lot of the costumes too.
---
I didn't care for them much, but they have potential. I just don't want to see them get abandoned and hope they just left them out of this map for some sort of immersion or lore reason (e.g. order of shadows don't have much presence in Thunderhead, or the way their events are setup make it hard to make space for bounties) 
---
Yeah I know, but TD meta always left in my mind thoughts like: "What if this is just first strike force? What if Chaks have forces much greater than we assume? What if the true danger from them is much deeper?" and so on. We'll propably won't get exploration of this aspect, but it's always fun to think about.
---
I never noticed the Blade Runner reference in that conversation.
---
Hi noob lol.
---
I had an issue like this, fixed it by re-entering the saved card info. Worked thereafter
---
If I remember correctly back in 2015 during the release of HoT MO said armour sets take 6 months to create which I guess it makes sense you need to make them for the armour weights of each race that what 5 races so 12 armour sets. 3 for human, 3 for norn etc etc.
---
I have never understood why the outfits are a 'single piece'. I would honestly throw more money at Anet if i could buy an outfit and just use the head or chest etc with other items I have collected.
---
If anything I catch myself rping too much. I dont think I could do the standing out so much thing like some players do, cause I don't wanna have to put on sunglasses to look at my toon. Disguising as an npc sounds fun though. 
---
Woah. We should start a Sylvari death cult. 
---
The "starter area" usually indicates levels 1-15. At this point, a player hasn't even scratched the surface for the combat depth and they've not played long enough to really see any effect of traits, utilities, or even elite skills on a build, which come together to create a much broader experience than what is available in current WoW. In current WoW, you generally have one build for each role on each class, with little to no variance between the meta customization picks for your given role. At max level in GW2, this system opens up even further with elite specializations that can fundamentally alter how your class plays. Further, at this point in the game, mob AI and mob density does very little to showcase some of the more challenging aspects of the combat system. You very rarely even have to dodge to survive until level 60+, which is when the skill ceiling becomes more apparent. Whereas, in WoW, a typical DPS rotation determines your survivability in the open world, but, at least for most classes like Paladin or Hunter, your rotation is 4-5 skills mainly and 2-3 others occasionally, but there's really never any danger of dying from a mechanical mistake. I'd be surprised if anyone in the world played WoW still if their experience with the game was based solely on the first 15 levels in the most fundamentally boring, clunky, and repetitive questing system of all modern MMOs.   
---
I think the issue is that there's probably not much narrative or aesthetic connection for you in GW1 as is the case for a lot of people coming from other established franchises. In my experience playing and raiding in Legion, much of WoW is pretty much the same at max level when compared to level 15. The base rotations don't really change too, too much and the only thing that does is the aesthetics, the added rep grinds, and the daily quests. But at core, the questing mechanics are all repetitive, very little voiced content, and you have to read nothing short of a novel and encyclopedia just to understand WoW's universe. Looking back on my experience with GW2 since launch, the game has fundamentally changed from when it released, to each expansion, and to now, and even at each interval I decided to pick it back up, it was refreshing. The difference between the games for me is that GW2 just feels immersive, modern, refreshing, and fun. WoW I only ever felt compelled to play because of friends, but the underlying structure of the game just isn't fun in comparison to GW2, but you won't see that at level 15 where you can pretty much auto attack and not die.
---
Next to the game needing build templates this is probably the most popular opinion in the game and the new outfit coming tomorrow is a perfect example as it looks like it could easily work with all heavy armor.
---
I dont think that food, infusions, ascended gear and slightly better rotation can lead to 50% dps gain.
---
Don't get me started on the "Another Kind of Shatterer" achievement. 10 encased soldiers available from the event, which requires you to fail a previous event (has anet still not learned?) and you can only get credit for the finishing blow on the encasement.
---
What gamemode do you play where you face that many condis?
---
Aye im jaded but I still love gw2 so it doesn't matter, gw2 is fucking awesome, but a lot of things in it ain't so i just refer to the negative shit because reddit
---
Reduce character model limit, reflections, shadows. Effect LOD in combat on top of those.
---
"My grandma made great red bean cakes. I'd kill for one right now. Really. I bet you think I'm joking."
---
"I...heard the commons has some. I'd show you but I have to be somewhere else now. Good day!"
---
&gt; God I hope no more dragons.  
---
...That's... literally what GW2's overarching story is *about*, broham.
---
This is a very popular opinion, not unpopular in the slightest. What you might not know, and I can't fault you for this, is that creating armor with individual pieces is much harder than creating outfits. When you create an outfit rigging can be a lot easier and you don't have to worry about seams between pieces (outside of the head, of course.) I do prefer new armor pieces myself, as it does allow for a lot more individuality, but I can't say that I would rather have one new armor set instead of four new outfits. That's just me, though, and you're entitled to your own opinion.
---
(Oh, and outfits like the haunted armor would be nigh impossible as armor sets, just because of the ghostlike mist.)
---
Fantastic and informed response, thanks for making it.
---
Season 1... the forgotten season.  Also in season 2 Canach is one of the sylvari captured by the inquest that Caithe and Faolain rescue.  At that time he has long white leafy hair.  Now he has thorny hair.
---
Ideas are like cream. Good ones rise to the top.
---
Oh you sweet, sweet summer child...
---
Then i don't know i did it last night just to test it and i got it. I had to step a bit to the right side of the door.
---
Had the same problem a couple of years back. Support solved it for me with a pretty weird fix. In my country we write our addresses with a lot of punctuation marks. They told me to get rid of all punctuation and that fixed it. But best bet is to wait for customer support to figure it out if there is something on their end.
---
&gt; I just hope they manage to pull it off, and we don't have to wait until late April or even early May to get it. 
---
lmao you're not getting Ep.6 until at least late March or early April if it's being done by Team 3... xD
---
This is why all my characters use Nightfury. Every other shoulder item looks ugly for my liking.
---
The small things you could tweak/add to your build won't add up to anything meaningful DPS wise. From person testing I found shredder gyro isn't as good as rifle turret (because of the tool belt) either, in fact, shredder gyro remains a weak option overall. 
---
Scrapper remains a meme, sadly
---
And whether the foot armor is just weird elongated boots with claw holes. Worst when the shoe still has a heel just floating there.
---
As with so much of this stuff, the same behaviours if presented differently can still be just fine, socially speaking.
---
If someone says "Sorry, I was expecting a one-shot, I don't have time to practice" - that's just fine! Set and manage expectations.
---
Versus silently leaving the group, or trash talking other players, which is not.
---
Everyone has different priorities and values, we don't get to change that. All we can hope for is people to behave more reasonably.
---
i don't think they wanna to them anymore since they would have to make some effort for combability and to prevent clipping. Using outfits is just the cheap route to go, even tho they could have at least split headpieces more...
---
Yeah... This is far from an unpopular opinion. But when we get upgradable sets of armor with Livung story episodes, what more do you want? The gem store is always going to have cosmetic options and outfits are a great way of having thought out looks and concepts that don't clip or would if they were armor. 
---
Also try to find some non high-heels like boots for non-charr female characters that actually look good.
---
I've had a much better time with a condi warrior than I have with a power build, though I'm not sure how much of that is personal preference for the play style vs. actual DPS output.  In both cases I feel like Revenant packs a heavier punch, with Holosmith and Mirage hitting heavier still.
---
I get that Warrior is the meta offensive support and probably always will be, but solo it feels a bit underwhelming compared to other classes.
---
It's an even bigger reason. If the outfit itself have clipping issues, just imagine how horrible it would be, if you combined it with armor pieces.
---
All together now:
---
If Mordremoth could attack the Mother Tree in the Grove, it can attack anywhere!
---
I don't even like outfits, but they have started adding loads more skins than they used to, so: nah we're fine.
---
Ah that's heartbreaking. Gyros are so cool too. 
---
Canach was first introduced even before Season One, when Southsun Cove was added, he was an NPC involved in that scenario.  Later on during Season One, he returned to Southsun as an eco-terrorist opposing the Consortium there, and he looked physically different than he had earlier, as he'd apparently been on the run from them for some time.
---
Nor do I. But 7% from just sigils, an ascended weapon, and slightly better food could get it to 22k/23k. Then people who know engineer much better than I giving advice could rise that even more. I'm not trying to hit 40k. But 25k would be just as good as most pugs on meta classes tbh.
---
I love it when people that have simply no idea about asset design just throw stuff like this out there.
---
Gyros as a concept are pretty cool but their implementation sucks balls. I love engi with a passion (it's my most played character) but Scrapper is probably one of the worst if not the absolute worst elite specs in game. It's a shame because hammer as a weapon is very versatile 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS2aE8w3Gq0 will always be the best. Then there is a Charr in south west of Sparkfly Fen stanind on a wall to a camp humming. I stopped by many time and listened to him. He is great :D
---
&gt; When ever they make new armor they have to retroactively go back to every other piece of armor and make sure they don't overlap in any horrendous way.
---
Except they don't even do that most of the time, or if they do it's only on the human setup because Charr and Asura have quite a bit of that form of clipping. A lot of it isn't even a "compromise" of slight clipping that isn't noticeable. That's why it's not an excuse for me. They have bad forms of both types of clipping and at this point the more items they add the worse it's going to get so just let it happen because they obviously can't deal with it for the non-human choices and on Humans, Norn, and Sylvari it won't be a hugely visible issue.
---
I'd rather have the option to design around a piece of armor that clips somewhat into another piece than to not have the option entirely.
---
Ah. Yeah ok that makes sense.
---
Just a tiny bit less, but it won't really matter. I leveled up my 73 to 77 in some of the starter zones x3 it does matter at later levels tho like if an event on lvl 80 gives you 25K, on lvl 15 zones it's gonna give you 15K. But you're lower level so it doesn't really matter. Complete the zone. Explore it. Enjoy the scenes and vistas. Whichever you like most.
---
I'm not actually sure of the exact amount, but you can easily level throughout all the low level zones and continue leveling up as you were leveling in level-appropriate zones. This subreddit also has a weekly question thread pinned to the top, usually you get your answer much faster this way instead of creating your own thread :)
---
Palamedes#7760. I dont use it often but Ill reply ASAP
---
Yeah it's such a shame that such cool mechanics (hammer playstyle and gyros) are so useless. But I'm glad it at least does enough to still down bosses in a meme run so it's playable sometimes!
---
The name of 'Guild Wars' comes from the backstory of the original game, where the 'Guild Wars' were a series of battles between organizations representing the three human kingdoms before the actual game kicked off.  They were the reason the kingdoms didn't want to work together even in the face of a dangerous threat, the invasion of the Charr.
---
With Guild Wars 2, while players can create their own guilds for social activities and occasional bonus game content, the guilds themselves aren't a big story hook anymore.  Your guild is what you want it to be.  With that said, the game lets you join five guilds at the same time, so you and your friend can feel free to have your own personal guild to share, but you can still join someone else's larger guild(s) to participate in various content with more players.  And what your guild represents is entirely up to you.  A noble house, a trading company, a band of adventurers, a secret society of cannibals, Quaggan mesmers infiltrating human society, whatever you want!
---
That’s probably one of the best things gw2 did.  The whole world is still worth playing no matter what level you are.  And it’s worth playing imo.  
---
I'm a newbie as well, and I used one of the boosts so I could get the raptor mount.  Just do the first PoF quest on an 80 and all characters on the account get the raptor.  Other than that I agree, don't use level 80 boost to "play the game"; it's better experienced from the start, so you can learn how to play and enjoy it :-)
---
Jeez, yeah. I luckily got 8 shatters when I randomly was walking round the area, but now I can't get the last 2 for the life of me
---
That's not really how it works. Pugs don't do low damage only because they play dps badly. Supports are also slacking, meaning less dps for everyone. 
---

---
I wouldn't mind more armor skins as I like to mix and am always looking for that perfect fashion wars mix, but I don't mind the outfits either.
---
What I really want is the ability to toggle off the outfit headpiece and be able to see the head armor underneath, or to be able to toggle off the outfit but keep the headpiece showing. Sadly, since they can make coin by selling parts of outfits as separate skins, I doubt this will be a thing ever.
---
I have one of each race. I've never noticed anything drastically bad on charr in terms of actual clipping. A bit too separated from the back, weapons and back items, but nothing on clipping for me.
---
1. The gravling issue is not a design choice it's a bug, rooted in the fact that the plate is not a drop, its something that is triggered by it's death but not a drop, not on the loottable etc. On top of that they have suggested a hotfix (not sure if its in yet?)
---
2. I agree this should be there, although its not as important as in other cases. Since you dont pick up the oil into your inventory, you cannot collect a lot and miss dropping it off. Since you need to be at the collector to get the vacuum and are full really fast while moving barely away its actually hard to miss. The only issue is that really large zergs can vacuum the oil away from right under your nose.
---
3. this is indeed annoying, would not be as bad thought if the achievement had better collision detection, since overall there are enough spots, just not enough of those your can do the achievement at. Technically this will probably be caused by this not actually being a resource node.
---
Canach's original appearance was a bright green Sylvari with a much softer and effeminate face. It wasn't until near the climax of the Southsun chapter of LWS 1 that Canach changed his look to what it is today. 
---
Pretty dang easy to play.

Your ambush skills are your main damage and you get access to them when you are under Mirage Cloak
---
**So pretty much Dodge, Staff 1. Dodge, Staff 1.**
---
Your clones will copy you so you get 4 Ambush attacks off at once. 
---
[Illusionary Ambush](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Illusionary_Ambush) Utility also gives you access to your ambush skills and breaks your enemy's target on you. Use as a blink or to save your clones. It confuses the hell out of people. **Standing still and acting like a clone works** 
---
Sceptor / Torch is mainly offensive while Staff is mainly defensive. 
---
**Staff**
---
Staff 2 ([Phase Retreat](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Phase_Retreat)) is great to get you out of range of your target, Staff 4([Chaos Armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos_Armor)) is great for when melee enemies are on you. Staff 5 ([Chaos Storm](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos_Storm)) also limits people from coming close to you. Doing staff 2 ([Phase Retreat](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Phase_Retreat)) while in the Staff 5's ([Chaos Storm](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos_Storm)) field is a great combo to give you chaos armor (basically staff 4)
---
 however, a TON of damage comes from your Staff 1 ambush skill called [Chaos Vortex](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos_Vortex). You want to use this as much as possible.
---
Dance around your target, spam your dodge to access your [Chaos Vortex](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos_Vortex) ambush skill.
---
**Sceptor/Torch**
---
Sceptor 2 is a block that u should use very often. Super easy to get a free block. just hold it out and it summons a clone who applys 5 stacks of torment to the enemy. VERY Useful, use it often. Use Sceptor 3 to hit people at a long range that does 3-5k dmg. 
---
**Torch 4 and 5 both have fire skills that require you to be pretty dang close to the person.** Torch 4 explodes fire around you after 3 sec so be close to the person if u want to use it offensively.
---
Torch 5 does flame damage up close when you activate it so try to stand close to the enemy.
---
Your ambush skill (that is revealed when you dodge) is ... "okay". it is called [Ether Barrage](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ether_Barrage). I prefer to use staff 1's ambush skill for a lot of damage.
---
**Traits:**
---
Blink is on a short 20 sec cool down so use it often to dance around your enemy or blink up to ledges to buy time.
---
Your heal is a "heal over time" so be aware of that. It also pops out a [Mirage Mirror](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mirage_Mirror) Diamond that you should use to get access to your ambush skills or just as a free "dodge".
---
Use [Arcane Thievery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Arcane_Thievery) as it comes up or to send condis away. It stealls the full duration of boons too. It also gives you access to Mirror that will reflect projectiles (your blink does it too) so do not be afraid to use it against rangers who pew pew you. Because of this trait [Master of Manipulation](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Master_of_Manipulation) you get mirror for 2 seconds when you use Blink or Arcane thievery.
---
I'd argue that is how it works. I main support and have my legendary armor and all that jazz. A large portion of pugs hit very low numbers even on golem unfortunately. Yes, supports can be just as disappointing, but that's not the point of this post.
---
&gt; I have never understood why the outfits are a 'single piece'.
---
It is because each armour type has different seam points where each piece starts/ends. They're consistent within an armour type but you can't mix &amp; match or you'll end up with clipping or actual gaps in your character model e.g. between the leggings and chest.
---
It is a design mistake but not something they can fix without redoing 2 of the 3 armour types. Their "fix" is just to do outfits since you only ever have it as a single piece.
---
I still lament upon coming back to GW2 that Anet has dropped all pretense of a living world with instancing overlays to place new story content on the existing zones. The potential to provide a post-HOT version of Tangled Depths or Tarir as part of a new season that shows the rise of an alternative Sylvari society based on some combination of Mordrem refugees and anarchist Nightmare Court elements struggling for power after Faolin's death would be suitably epic for the game. As a bonus we'd avoid another dragon or insane god scenario.
---
I'd hardly call that hair. More like... bald with thorny skin.
---
Or you could have been a bit more caring about your information. Dunno, I have all of my accounts backed up on a doc that only I can access. Useful when you manage 14 different and unique passwords.
---
This is exactly my gripe with the GW1 to GW2 transition. The merits of lots of the changes are subjective, i.e. open world vs. instances or quests vs. dynamic events and hearts. But in my mind build craft  is a shadow of its former self. 
---
Traits tried to substitute for secondaries and skill diversity, but they're mostly passive effects you can set and forget. Plus, their tiered nature means there's usually one obvious choice out of the three available based on whether you want power, condi, boon support, or healing. 
---
People try to say everyone just got funneled to the optimal FOTM builds, but unlike taking the wrong traits, suboptimal creative GW1 builds were fun! And often viable enough, too. I could play a by-the-books Spiteful Spirit or Minionmancer Necro, but I could also whip out a support one with wells or orders, or even a Meleemancer if I felt daring. So much customizability, effectively lost.
---
PoF has some good looking armor sets. why not try those?
---
"Your face is funny. It's all squished and weird."
---
"No, your face is funny. It's like a little raisin."
---
This rose has thorns. Here they are!
---
if you can't wait for something that originates from your own carelessness I guarantee you'll not really enjoy the game in the first place
---
Given the meta often ends with 5-10 minutes left on the clock if the lanes are being played, they should add a full world boss in the chamber behind the wall that's necessary to get access to the crystalized chests.
---
&gt;However it seems as of late Anet is trying to make base classes a little less bad.
---
Cries as they nerf core Ele to fix Weaver again...
---
I reccomend taking a look how fractals work on the wiki page. It will anwser a lot of questions about rewards and how agony works. Dont be afraid to start we were all once in your shoes. If you are tackleing a fractal or a biss you dont know let your teammates know. In most cases people will explain to you what needs to be done. I would however advise that you climb to fractal 100 before you start raiding since its a good example of whats to come and how organised play and meta looks like.
---
It would be...pointless. Cause Aurene is Glint's scion aka her key to defeating Kralk. Why would killing kralk without her and then even reviving her be reasonable? That would take her purpose as scion away and only make her seem like a burden.
---
Best table.
---
i've been leading several training runs (be it any raid boss or even fractal CMs) and theres this very weird type of players, the worst of all imo because i just cant figure out whats going on in their heads:
---
after struggling for a couple of tries one player leaves because... whatever - no time to continue, exhausted, grumpy,... you choose. now, theres me, obviously leading the group or even the squad, having this very bright commanders symbol above my head. and after this one player left more and more people start folliwing him. its happened several times that i was left with 4/10 or 2/5 players. upon pm'ing the players that left (not the first one since they usually say goodbye and why theyre leaving) i often see those players kind of confused... "what do you mean 'why did i leave'? i thought the run was over?". and i'm like "how do you think the run was over? it's obviously me leading this run. did you see me saying the run is over?!"
---
now usually i can just invite them and they will join again. but its just so damn unneccessarry and annoying getting everyone back together.
---
pls tell me i'm not alone with this.
---
I like it! Simple yet interesting. Not every fashion wars idea has to be flashy.
---
Have patience. Meanwhile you can create new f2p account to check all the classes and things before you begin to play your original account. :)
---
This.
---
Male sylvari medium armor is hard mode. You got that problem plus every piece of cloth (trenchcoat, buttcape) hanging from your waist floats away from your body like you're Marilyn Monroe standing over a subway grate.
---
Dont call me out like this
---
&gt; Except they don't even do that most of the time, or if they do it's only on the human setup because Charr and Asura have quite a bit of that form of clipping. A lot of it isn't even a "compromise" of slight clipping that isn't noticeable. That's why it's not an excuse for me. They have bad forms of both types of clipping and at this point the more items they add the worse it's going to get so just let it happen because they obviously can't deal with it for the non-human choices and on Humans, Norn, and Sylvari it won't be a hugely visible issue.
---
Everybody would get really bad clipping including human shaped characters. The seam points between pieces is different depending on the armour type. The most obvious one was the waist seam where your leggings ended and where your chest started. Some combinations would clip badly and some would just have a noticeable gap.
---
Where the skirt is attached differs depending on the type as well. Light + heavy has it as part of the legs. Medium has it as part of the chest.
---
This game is guildwars, but dont have a guild wars like others game for example lineage 2.
---
Had medical issues. Couldn't touch gaming for a long time minus occasional games of Fortnite. Phone was stolen, yada yada, wasn't really carelessness but sure. There are so many reasons why someone could lose access to their authenticator then begins the waiting game.
