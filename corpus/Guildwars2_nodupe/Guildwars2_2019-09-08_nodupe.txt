I literally don't care about grammar right not, im busy with guild missions at this very moment.
---
---
---
A decent compromise. +1.
---
They did it purposefully to punish everyone who catered to the human female meta...just to spite you.
---
&gt;There's nothing in GW2 that replaces the role classic quests filled.
---

---
I kinda feel like the Side Stories do. Burden of Choice and Knight of the Thorn at least.
---
Got to farm those upvotes, eh?
---
&gt;i prefer something that i can play with berserker stats.
---
that's literally every class in the game, and every class is good for open-world PvE
---

---
Imo meteor shower shouldn't show its target circle, it should have smaller "fill in" circles to telegraph each meteor fall.
---
Then they can stop handing it heavy-handed nerfs since the problem is that you failed to dodge the telegraphed attack, not that you were nailed by 2 consecutive crits you had little to no warning of.
---
Also has the potential to make it more effective area denial since you can't know right away exactly where the safe boundary is.
---
&gt; Why aren't more people talking about this?
---
because nothing has changed.. we still get to play the game.
---
Why mourning? WvW dailies are fast and easy.
---
So literally aura infusions, but as a dye and only one time use.
---
There would be a lot to chose from I dont even know where to look haha
---
ding ding ding we have a winner
---
Alright, that explains it. Thanks!
---
You must be new..
---
It looks like they go on sale about twice a year. The wiki has the gem store history for the [Season 2](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_2_Complete_Pack#Gem_Store_history), [Season 3](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_3_Complete_Pack#Gem_Store_history), and [Season 4](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_4_Complete_Pack#Gem_Store_history) complete packs.
---
Snowy maps are the least aesthetically pleasing imo. Snow, trees, rocks, repeat. Utterly bleak. Same as in GW1. Personal opinion, but I've always disliked the Shiverpeaks. I'm looking forward to the charr homelands, but the faster we can get in and out of Jormag's bland territory, the better.
---
lmao, enjoy. Also, happy that you took the time and watched some videos. It's a weird part of youtube.
---
Wasn’t it obvious that you don’t?
---
I've seen rev hammer hit up to 20k (it was a glass scourge, but still), and no warning, nothing??? yeah, that needs to be nerfed or at least be telegraphed properly and a higher CD
---
It's significantly less active.  I think a lot of people don't have the energy to continue playing regularly and aren't going to waste time arguing against the casual majority.  I think the people that are angry and want everyone to be angry are the "worst of the worst," of the remaining folks, and those are the people I really wish would leave the game.  I'm more in the middle; there are things that I'm excited about, but it's not worth playing the game outside big patch cycles anymore.
---
The louder the disturbance on here is, the more people walk away. You think it's quiet because negative people are leaving the game. It's also quiet because positive people don't feel at home or welcome right now.  They're both factors.  It's okay if you don't believe that to be true, but I'm telling you that kind of negativity drives a lot of my crowd away from here. Again, I'm usually the exception.
---
Oops, poor assumption.  Been playing since beta, just not religiously.
---
I'd like to see a version of V2 with the position of the good guys and bad guys swapped so that the entire left half is blue.
---
It was because the animation played during a cutscene where a story character died.
---
Chad vinetooth vs the virgin arrowhead
---
Do you have a source for that? I've heard about 3 different reasons for it lol.
---
Just dont do hearts theyre boring excluding a few. Hearts are another failed concept from 2012. After playing many different mmo's the old quest system is still better. The closest thing we get to real quests is the knight of thorns, first group of gen 2 legendaries, skyscale, roller beetle, and cooking 500 collections. I enjoyed those very much but i cant redo them unless i buy a new account.
---
Uhh like... timberline falls?
---
Now it says error 404 tho. :D
---
It could be people are leaving. Or it could be their complaints are the same complaints that were before Anet's presentation. Face it, the presentation furor was a storm in a teacup that no one would be talking about in a month anyway, for all that it was badly handled by Anet.
---
  
---
But the idea that oh people aren't talking about this because they're leaving...some of those people that had been talking had left already anyway. You want to know the health of the game/subreddit, the months ahead will tell, not what's going on this second. And yes, the demographic of the game would likely change. But the way you word your post has implications and taken in line with other implications, I have every right to add my opinion into that mix. I didn't personally attack you. You're the one who is being combative here.
---
Yet here you are complaining like a complete moron about something you should know it exists since 2012-13. So much for starting since beta
---
The only legendary dye I could imagine would be a Legendary Darkest Black that will dye your armor to the darkest black that's currently available. Same with Legendary Lightest White.
---
or got downed
---
2 looks more awesome
---
Pocket raptors were nothing with lightning destroying everything in a 10 yard radius. Now the smokescales and the snipers...
---
What of you use some of the same pieces for different builds? How would you manage legendary armor and runes/sigils? And most importantly how would anet sell more bag expansion slots?
---
Oh but no one is tired of hearing what you're saying. K then. Nice chat. lol
---
Oh shit, the new map will give more frame rate drops if this really happens.
---
Did you make a Filet of Sous-Vide Meat?
---
Grats!
---
You can just do what I do and throw them on a mule. Tbh though I just deleted most of them
---
You're the one started bringing up boring arguments to disprove a point that wasn't made. If I bore you, please do it like me and don't engage with the people that bore you. You'll be much happier and much less frustrated, not hearing the same 5 arguments over and over on a 3 year long loop.
---
First things first, semantics.
---
What you are asking for is what I call "Gear loadout".
---
For me "templates" stores just the info of the build, not the actual gear. Stats, upgrades, traits, skills, equipped weapons. Without indicating any specific gear.  Like the rudimentary PvP templates we already have.   
---
Templates can be shared with other players, downloaded from pages, generated by build sites like metabattle, and you'd be able to store and sort as many as you want as text files and in subfolders in your "Templates" folder inside the Guild Wars 2 folder in the Documents folder, next to "Screens".    
---
So any player could have a virtually infinite number of templates.  
---
Templates would be usable for both PvE and PvP builds.   
---
They are basically just the "blueprint" of the build.   
---
Templates will attempt to load the build based on the gear you carry and the skills and traits you have available.  and if you don't have access to one of them, it just gives up on that and leaves that part of the build empty.  
---
For example, if the template requires a greatswords and you don't have it, in PvE you'll get a red message warning and the weapon slot is left empty.   But in PvP, templates will generate free level 0 gear and put it in the slot.  
---
Try load load a Reaper template when you don't have access to the expansion content, and you'll only get equipped the other 2 elite specialziations, and the elite slots would be left empty.   
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Loadouts in the other hand is what I mean for what stores specific actual gear just as you had it equipped when you saved the loadout. It can be for gear, for customziations, or both. And there could be slots for it.
---
For example, characters could start with 1 free Loadout slots, get another one for free by completing Personal story,  purchasing it in PvP or WvW vendors. And extra ones would be available in the gemstore for the price of an inventory bag.   
---
If loadouts also store customizations, players who are not interested in story diffrent build could still use loadouts to store different gear appearance and customization choices. Skins, outfits, back, glider, mounts, etc.
---
More evidence that shoulder slots are a mistake in any RPG.
---
If you're so annoyed by my posts, ignore them. You have to know I'm going to reply. As for whether an argument is boring or not, sort of your opinion, but anyway I'm done with this conversation. You've already admitted to starting the aggression. Feel free to finish it.
---
In Jahai Bluffs there are two Sparks that throw electric energy at each other. It looks like they're playing tennis!

We have a [bookshelf](https://imgur.com/fL8WbYM) in Sun's Refuge. But not for all books. There are also some random books scattered around the instance's tables.

Would be nice if they expanded on this adding extra bookshelves and place for story novelties.

Holographic dragon helmet

Thanks :)

I think the icebrood logo will be the POF logo, with the color blue taking it over, starting from the right.
---
Yes most likely bugged. IV done it a few times for people who need, just this week actually someone tried it, didn't die or go down but didn't get the achiv item. Apparently that's his 4th KC kill and no item.
---
A couple of months back did it with a guildie who was also bugged, he contacted support about it and they basically told him "tough luck, keep trying till u get the item". (He got it on his 2nd KC kill).
---
I personally got mine on the first kill and didn't even know it could get bugged till a few months ago. Really hope u manage to get yours soon^
---
What are those gloves? And shoulders?
---
Definitely make sure you use some sort of cheap build or league starter.  You can search for 3.7 League Starters on YouTube and get a number of builds to work with.  I'd suggest something by Zizaran just because of how the PathofBuilding's are laid out.
---
ranger is also heally or a stabby
---
I think when he says consume, he means that a copy will be made, kind of like how the current wardrobe mechanic works. The part about bag expansion slots is why I don’t think this will be happening
---
Can't avoid meteor showers when I have 10 weavers max buffed.
---
It is incredible how you fight to win a subject that do not effect you in any shape or form. I said it would be good if they had made it so that you can get the bonus Tyria as well so that you can make it faster and catch up. Somehow this seem to be a total disaster for you if it was added and you fight so hard over it that it becomes silly. 
---
So here is what i will do. It is ok if you do not want it to be like that you can keep on fighting over it and that is fine i have no issues accepting that we do not think alike. I will stick with my thoughts were i belive that it would have been so much better if they added bonus to all mastery regions so that players can choose what they need to work on.
---
Double-handed greatsword?
---
Firebrand is actually the dominant class.  The meta will always remain stale until the Guardian is gutted as a whole.  Scourges are weak and stupid easy to kill
---
The guardian is basically all what is wrong with WvW.  Where every class does 1-2 things well and another mediocre, the Guardian does at least 10-12 things well, which is why many commanders refuse to leave spawn until they have enough in their party.  Wins and losses also get blamed on the volume of them in the party.  If that doesn't flag as being a massive problem, I don't know what is.
---
The guardian needs to lose many of their abilities and keep to doing 1-2 things well like party stability and retaliation.  Remove all their reflects, group aegis, condition purging/conversion, lower their healing drastically, remove their enhanced revive capabilities, remove all their blocks and invulnerables, then and only then are they now on par with every other class.
---
Case and point of all what's wrong with WvW and how Anet listens to the wrong people.  Many WvW'ers cannot agree on what should be balanced or nerfed.  There is one thing though that nearly everybody can agree on and that boon spam is completely out of control.. so what does Anet do?
---
They are looking to nerf devouring darkness, from converting 3 conditions down to 2 on 5 targets.  Yet here we have our friend the Firebrand with a skill that converts 5 conditions to boons on 5 targets on a 12s cool down (and it's remaining untouched).  Worst part about that skill is it functions like an elite skill, but sits on a 12s cool down.
---
So basically, the community:  "Hey Anet, boon spam is out of control, do something about it".  Anet's response "OK we'll nerf devouring darkness so people can have more boons"...................
---
And people wonder why the meta is stale....
---
Your gems will be in the mail shortly.
---
&gt; Can we make build templates in such a way that it requires a player to 'consume' gear in order to create a template?
---
Just make a new kind of inventory where you can put all your weapons/armors in and this inventory is used for build templates. 
---
Or easier, make new "build templates"-bags that only can contain weapons/armor/trinkets and unlocks the contained items for build templates. Yes it would take inventory space, but since unid gear we realy have enough inventory space, even without upgrades. Also this would support legendary stuff a bit.
---
1. You can't karma farm anymore.
---
2. Most of anets market / audience really are casual players, most of whom never come on reddit or social media and never hear about this drama.
---
And yet you are still here making replies on a game you quit and moved on from :P
---
So 2v2 will have a queue? Honestly that’s the only thing that’ll revamp pvp.
---
When I was dissapointed by the lack of a decent amount of new body animations in both the expansions a dev replied that it is far less time consuming to create particle effects than body animations. In particle effects you just feed an algorithm with parameters and iterate until you have a satisfying result. On body animation you habe to carefully place bone by bone, frame by frame, validate nature, check pose, spine, speed etc for the result to be believeable. Particles by abilities also often just have to be sparkly enough.        So sad looking at these crazy body bending gw1 ritualist animations.
---
Their brain is still in beta.
---
Never said you can't.
---
&gt;This sub gives the picture like 5 people play for 5 minutes a day and that the balance is so messed up, they removed all content and you can only play if you spend 50000 us
---
You are incredibly dumb if THAT is what you've gotten after all this.
---
Man, the hate is off the rails about people whining about no ex pack and instead releasing another LW. No this, no that, on and on.
---
It's only been 4 days chief. I haven't ruled out playing again. I'm not here to bash on it. I'll still keep up with the info. Just don't atm feel like sinking in any hours. 
---
Plus , I do what I want and don't need to justify it
---
OP do you accept constructive criticism?
---
That makes sense
---
This is kinda a dumb question but I'm a returning player who just got Flames after leaving around the launch of Thorns. I'm torn between if I wanna play a Guardian, Elementalist, or Revenant. How are those classes these days?
---
I like to live on the riskier side of life.
---
Some people aren't mad about what's being released. It's the *way* they released it. New content is good and all, but a LW and some skins and and what's essentially "baby raids" doesn't warrant multiple announcements, a countdown, and renting out a **theater**. 
---
I wanna say that if it was just a blog post then people wouldn't be as mad, but I don't rule out the more rabid folks here.
---
It’s valid feedback, or join a guild that raids and have them train you? I don’t raid but in wvw your guild will run closed raids where they train you to max dos and survivability in a fights. Other times you just run into a random tag and most likely die if you don’t know what’s going on.
---
Game is only 7 years! Officer! This way!
---
Lol I thought your comment above was your last dying breathe....
---
Let me apologize when I say that I don't really understand where you're coming from. The person decided to do a simple minimalist sketch of his character, possibly using a program like MSPaint and suddenly they're being attacked because people are making assumptions on their intent. Try looking at r/mspaintbattles or r/mspaint because the same quality in this post is also expressed on some of the images on those subs as well. I feel this is a valid post without any ill will involved. 
---
I don't think it's right to suddenly jump to conclusions unless you really know the person behind the post.
---
Hey, I don’t raid so I don’t know much about this. Why do people buy into groups instead of the normal way where it’s free?
---
Nah you can still progress, get ascended gear and weapons by only spvp and a bit of crafting.
---
It looks like neither one has their shoulders displayed, and the only gloves I'm seeing are the one on the left has Shackles of Madness on.
---
If you're talking about the reddish effect going up their arms, that's just due to their race. Sylvari have a natural bioluminescence at night (the plant people glow in the dark) and you can set the color and how intense the glow is during character creation.
---
Whaaaat that’s sick...
---
There you go again with meaningless "most people" comments.  Tell ya what.  You go search for how many times this topic has come up in the past.  There's your statistics.
---
For damage, you could go Grieving with rune that give burn duration, sigil smothering, etc... With this build you could spike has hard has a power dps if you know the burst rotation.
---
but but you don't understand they've had layoffs!!! /s
---
u the big gay
---
&gt; the most competent light class on open world, PVP and end PVE content(fractal and raids)
---
Sword Weaver is what I'd recommend. Very strong in PvP, very comfortable in Open World, and very good DPS for Fractals/Raids.
---
Herald is also amazing at group events because of its boons.
---
I have a 100% boon duration (technically 120% with Facet of Nature) and he can upkeep permanent 15 Might, Fury, Swiftness, **Protection**, and Regeneration on ten people.
---
It's weapons (sword+shield/staff) give it tons of survivability and CC as well. It's really a powerhouse at metas.
---
Because when Jory's sister dies in the LW story, your character looks super bored, and it really broke any kind of emotional weight the scene had.
---
Why would you use Banners in Open World? 
---
I do everything I can to avoid having to use them because they're boring as fuck.
---
yeah taran is right, I dont have sholders or gloves but my guild mate has the shackles of madness on. you get them for candy corn during the halloween event. so if you want em they are coming up soon! :) and the glow is really cool right? i wish it wasnt only at night
---
If you’re looking for active guilds doing the kind of content you like doing, I suggest sending a whisper to someone nearby and asking them if you could join their guild. In WvW there are usually people promoting their guilds in team chat, and they are the ones running commander tags so they are pretty active. In other game modes I have no idea
---
I wanna be like you guys when I grow up
---
The Mastery rank only increases when you spend the point.
---
Oh trust me, I understand that. I just don't buy arenanet's claims of modeling and art time. Either they have a seriously inefficient pipeline or that was the biggest asspull I've ever heard. Animation is hard, sure, especially if you're someone who hasn't really done much of it, but for someone who is seasoned, you can get half-decent looking emotes cooked up in like 5 hours each. So have someone sit down for a month, use techniques that are template-able (can be easily applied to other races with minimal effort), and call it a day and a gemstore item. 30 new emotes. Done. One person. They don't even have to be *good*, just expressive.
---
This^
---
Ahhh.... that must be it.  Makes sense. 
---
**Thank you!!**
---
Your mastery rank doesn't go up when you acquire points, but when you train masteries. 
---
There's about 400 mastery points to acquire, but trained Masteries will only get to 295.
---
To get the remaining 20 mastery rank that you are missing, you have to unlock and train masteries you haven't trained before.
---
Most of things that hook graphics will not work. 
---
Also man on discord reported that using some tools that read screen data cause lag too.
---
Be sure that you have disabled various vsync and low latency things in drivers and ingame before goin to find some 3-rd party programss that interfere.
---
that would be the box the Bloody Prince is imprisoned in
---
we dont have to like the devs to love the game or even anet or ncsoft.
---
i believe the dev who stopped wvw tournament should have been fired, but that does not stop me from playing.
---
as i only play one account if ever that on account gets banned. i'll just move back to wow.  but until then, this is indeed a great game.
---
IIRC, that was because people were using the instance to Maize farm. I also used it for weapon mastery.
---
yes.
---
&gt; I have a 100% boon duration (technically 120% with Facet of Nature) and he can upkeep permanent 15 Might, Fury, Swiftness, Protection, and Regeneration on ten people.
---
Isn't this pretty much possible with full zerker?
---
just learn to start hacking :&gt;
---
dont need healers if the boss doesnt hit you ;)
---
I'd like to see more emotes in this game too. I think part of the issue is that in Guild Wars 1 everyone was human so each emote was just made once. Here you'd have to make different emotes for different races which is more time consuming.
---
I still think it probably would be worth it, but at the same time, so many areas of the game not getting updates often enough makes this a low priority. It's not like I'm going to play or not play this game based on the number of emotes it doesn't have. I think the demographic that uses that as a basis to play or not to play is probably very small.
---
Looks fine to me. Want better looking screenies? Install a better video card. Otherwise be grateful that Anet caters to you folks with 1998 PCs.
---
People really aren't talking enough about this. We have gotten not just a sneak peak at upcoming balance but they are actively soliciting targeted feedback for their changes \*and altering their changes accordingly\*. They're doing this for WvW and PvP. They're knocking down some of the most OP skills in those formats.
---
Maybe the reason why people aren't whining about the announcement is because the actual number of people upset about the announcement has gone down now that more information has come out about the prologue and it actually looks promising in several regards (not just a festival map, 10-man harder story encounter, the Rytlock/Logan romance everyone craves).
---
People are on here arguing that the announcement made GW2 a joke to outsiders, but I saw so many new players on this sub shortly after the announcement who were really interested by what was announced but then came on here and saw people screaming that the sky was falling.
---
Renegade Revenant with Healing Power, Power, Toughness (Apothecracy set). The set is extremly cheap, you just need two swords go into dwarf stance, summon the hammers and spam auto attack. If you feel fancy, you can use skill two or three. I was a bit worried my dmg might be too low since power isnt my main attribute, but this build is so comfortable to play, even vs a number of enemies.
---
NA here and I'm not honestly noticing any difference either. If anything, I'm noticing more people playing to get their masteries up for the 17th. Noticing more norn and charr characters as well, which makes sense.
---
Did they change the engineer sword skill animations? They look way nicer and cooler now but im not sure if I'm tripping
---
Guardian is good as ever.
---
Means the world to me, thank you!
---
Dragon Hunter, not double handed.
---
PvE perspective 
---
Guardian is strong as both DPS and healer/support. It even has some good hybrid gameplay by supplying quickness and DPS
---
Elementalist is strong as dps, both power and condition, relying heavily on sword or dagger for weaver and scepter for tempest. It's not as reliable of a support build as some of the more meta builds because it largely prioritizes the healing aspect rather than the support part
---
Revenant is meta as a support with renegade, because of its ability to supply assassin's presence (passive ferocity buff) and alacrity, especially when paired with a quickness firebrand. It's also pretty good as a condition build in specific raid scenarios
---
Nice job guys! Look forward to seeing more records.
---
Old content that could be repackaged as SOLD content. Not saying that I necessarily want this, but would certainly offer another avenue to accrue funds through the gem store.
---
[Ikr](https://i.redd.it/cbqcqed6fvn01.jpg)
---
Wut?
---
Don’t you get it? Joko is a good villain and zhaitan isn’t. Like how one wheel on the shopping cart always goes wild. Have you not sssn these memes?
---
Then people wouldn't buy bag slots. WvW Alliances will probably never actually make it into the game either. Just think about how much money they would lose out from server transfers.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Well, nevermind, there aren't enough people playing that game mode anymore for it to matter. hahaha.
---
It would be nice though.
---
Even more flagellant way. Like u need scribe + matts to prepare pages and covers producing "copy kit". Then u literally making a copy of a book in open world or so. Including such places as Hidden Arcana story, Astralarium and its spec collections, Kormir domain, Jahai Bluffs etc.
---
😄
---
Then just store this books in a bookshelf inside HI as was suggested earlier. + Thematic collections such as 'Elona', 'Religions', 'Elder Dragons' appreciated. But there is a minus, cause with new LS this collections may expand.. Cant find a solution now. But idea seems kinda interesting
---
One of the banner boy is different as well
---
You saying all the tap-tap on DH POV is not the boss hitting? Have I been doing raids wrong?
---
It is an amazing game. Not sure how much support you'll get at the moment, but I'm still having a lot of fun, and I've been here a long, long time.
---
Solution to a problem that didn't exist.
---
What? Messes with immersion, you say? It only adds, I say! Really, who *wasn't* yawning during the story?
---
**rimshot**
---
See I have done that. I've been playing since release and haven't gotten all the mysteries yet. But I have done all the story content and got my mounts. But I haven't played all characters or maps or classes so still lots for me and the wife to play. I still find lots of fun things to do. The magic of this game still hasn't worn off :)
---
You either die a hero, or live long enough to see your~~self become the villain~~ twin
---
Yeh pve players have tonnes to do :) on the other hand we got the short end of the stick.
---
I wish they would release them a little faster than in the past but after playing through all of LS4 in a few weeks I can agree that they are much better played spaced out.
---
Just to clarify further:
---
It needs to really be in your inventory, and not in your material storage when talking to the NPC :)
---
It's already like that, you pay for any episodes you didn't unlock. As for being single player... It's been exactly that for a while now.
---
Why?
---
To make people who are already whales inclined to buy more bank slots.
---
God forbid this post gets popular and they add /floss
---
I'm pretty sure most of the whales have maxed out their bank, I know I did, Hell I'd buy more bank slots if they'd let me.
---
The skills everyone uses are ok, but it has a ton of skills and traits that are either extremely undertuned &amp; or repetitive given other options on the same class.
---
A prime example is looking at  hollowed ground vs stand your ground.
---
Others include hammer auto chain (prot not needed since every healer has it covered), Signet of courage, signet of mercy, Sanctuary and numerous traits.
---
There is also the fact that the FB axe actually scales better with power and does more power damage then the 1h sword does.
---
Balance update: Boons removed from WvW.
---
"Pepe Farmer". Welp, i know who's getting banned now!
---
Depends how they do it.
---
Selfless daring swapping places with the heal on aegis break would be more about consistency and not having to dodge to heal.
---
Losing the endurance regen on purity of body would have some effect but over all would not really be noticed since it doesn't stack with vigor.
---
If a meme requires explaining, then there is no meme
---
No, he means reaper, because that's the way necromancer provides its own quickness.
---
have second account, kit out character to be same as main, position characters and take screenshot, post to reddit and get free karma..... fuck off mate.
---
if that was anets general mindset, we would not have seen any additions to the mat storage since launch.
---
and why would a whale keep planting, gathering and storing these, if they are not using them at all?
---
... you don't even use similar face or ear options.
---
Read the conversation
---
Well, it at the lowest right now, 50$. In that case, I think I'll grab it now, and soon the expansion.
---
Negatory. No ice/snow/norn banners.
---

I could do with another vanilla Orr or even pre-nerf HoT. But I think that ship has sailed.
---
Guardian can be fun and brings utilities to help you survive well.
---
No. I hate the idea of a legendary dye! That's going too far.
---
I agree
---
Pre-nerf HoT? Wdym
---
How is this relevant? BTW us who had it got one additional shared inventory slot.
---
Mystic Clover question , what is better you think to craft  10x  **Mystic Crystal**  or  Philosopher's Stone's when making Mystic Clover's ?
---
Shit was harder. Mobs, bosses, grind, requirements. It's still leaps and bounds beyond everything else in the game, but before the first few patches hit, HoT had quite a pinch of oldschool feeling to it. You either had to play really well or group up with others just to deal with the open world mobs, the amount of experience points to fill a mastery was immense, you had to invest a ton of time into the meta pres and then you failed. Release Gerent took weeks, IIRC, to finally get killed.
---
But will the rocks still have elephant skin texture?
---
In FFXIV there’s a book in your room that lets you replay any *cutscene* you’ve ever watched. 
---
Since GW2 has made such a ridiculous amount of journals and other lore-based items, you would think there’s at least a folder with all the text somewhere.
---
it's the same rate, the 10x is faster if doing bulk but can be affected more by RNG at low numbers. The 1x takes forever if doing a lot of crafts.
---
I am not the one shitposting others though.
---
Something I didn't see mentioned here, is that you can try out every available (to you, some things require buying expansions) class and specialization in the PvP area.  To access this, you need one level three character, which is super easy to get.  Then, make sure you have the PvP Panel bound to a key in the options, start a new character, and use the key to open the panel and click the PvP Lobby button.  You may need to get through the intro scene first, but that's brief (Asurans have a quick intro).  You bind it to a key because the PvP Panel button on the UI stays greyed out until you level up some, but it's just easing you into things, not locking you out.
---
In the PvP area, you are always level 80 (so everyone is equal) and your class is entirely unlocked.  You first enter the lobby area, which doesn't have any PvP, so you aren't in danger or fighting, but if you look around you'll find a little area with some golemns standing or moving around (there's a waypoint near it).  You can attack these to see how your abilities look/work.
---
This lets you fool around a little with everything if that helps find a fun class.  The PvP are also has a place to access your bank and a gate to Lion's Arch, which has gates to all the racial zones.  If you are a F2P account, you'll need a character at level 35 before you can use Lion's Arch.  Note that from the PvP area, you can bring up the panel again and Exit to return your character to right where you were in the PvE world, which is pretty convenient.  Your bank and some merchants are always just a load screen away.
---
If you have bought Path of Fire, I suggest making two parties.  One that you want to level and learn slowly, and one that you use your level-80 boost on and use to do level-locked stuff until your other characters catch up.  You probably won't want to delete the 80s after you commit to the boost, so be sure you'll be okay keeping them long-term.  Take the party of 80s and start the Path of Fire story (together).  Finish the first chapter (ignore/skip basically everything that happens or is said, because it will be confusing as heck and full of spoilers--you can easily replay it later when you get to it) and you'll have your first mount unlocked.  Mounts are account-wide, so now every character you create can hop on your mount for faster movement.  You can do the same with Heart of Thorns (though HoT will be harder to reach than PoF, be warned) to get your glider, which is not as useful (or as fast) as the mount, but can save you from falling to your death on occasion, and is nifty.
---
Also, if you have an expansion and level-80 boost, that's another way to try out classes.  Activating the boost on a character will take you to a whole map zone with your boosted character and gear.  You can't leave or gain xp here (unless you commit the boost), but you can play PvE around the zone to try the character and then cancel the boost.  Committing the boost requires double-confirming, so you won't do it by accident.  I'm pretty sure you can even do this together as a party (if you all have level-80 boosts available, of course).
---
Remember that a level 80 character is a lot to get used to at once.  Many say it's better to learn the game on your leveling characters as they make their long journey through the world (levels will give you little bite-size tips about what things are and how they work, and you won't see any of that on a boosted character).  Doesn't mean you can't play with them (especially to unlock stuff that benefits your whole account, or to do special events), just hold back judgement on the game until you get a proper feel for it.
---
Alright sounds simple enough. I'll try to read up on the wiki and watch out for it next time.
---
I can now that it's 8 hours after my comment :D
---
I don’t have Exordium yet. But I am making slow progress.
---
to be fair, quite a few people left the official forums due to ov
---
erzealous moderation
---
That pinky finger looks tiny or the pointer finger is massive, either way that should now be part of your characters lore assuming it wasnt before and the tattoo artist just screw the hand perspective/proportions up
---
Uh, we clearly didn't have a look at the same LFG then ...
---
To be fair there are far more words in German that translate poorly into English than the other way. I'd say blame it on those damn compound words but most of them are some of most hillarious and amazing words German has to offer.
---
Thank you :)
---
Read the shit you just wrote, and come back to tell me you're the one acting on FACTS AND LOGIC.
---
To be fair Zhaitan was hyped better and was a good villain on its own. Its just the fight that truly sucked
---
From the title I was hoping this was going to be about performance issues. Im so sad.
---
Yay, grats on the new Reddit banner! :D
---
They don't fix bugs in dungeons unless it's something like you get more rewards than intended.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Yeah that was my snap thought - the switch from the (skippable) dialogue scenes of the PS and dungeons to in-engine "stand around and wait for NPCs to stop talking" of the LW stories... uh.... wasn't an improvement, IMO.
---
(I know I'm in the minority here but holy heck does it nuke replayability.)
---
And I thought I am the only idiot who wastes his bank place with books.
---
Seeing this kind of stuff makes me wonder if all those pictures that are not jokes are made by or on the request of Anet XD
---
I mean skyrim had actual khajit related smut in the vanilla game, so I can't help but imagine it like that. Barbed dicks and all.
---
Reaper joins fractal group, bitches about meta... Um...
---
Go to enough furry conventions and I imagine someone will oblige you.
---
There will be no fix from Anet, probably.
---
But you can do something to avoid them the next time around:
---
P1: When you come to the part where you need to collect 5 Scepter-Parts -&gt; Kill the first group up the stairs and dont spawn the oozes.
---
P3: Once you cleared the crypt and are running through the next room to reach the 4 big-burrows...kill the last spider. The problem ist, that the last spider can kill your npc and if he is dead...there will be no cutscene.
---
Alternative: Make sure your NPC is alive when you engage the boss.
---
As for P2: I am not sure how to prevent this bug
---
Totally new to me. Given it has a dungeon symbol and all.
---
high quality autism there.
---
Anet dev A: "Hey man did you see that post about wvw?"
---
Anet dev B:" Yea...we gonna implemwqetewntituowei12jo\[fedwuj8hi\[fdsg09-dibvjkhsFDOJHVBNSIKLKDIU213HDFXSJFBJAAD in the coming months"
---
You can play literally anything in the open world on zerk. Personally I've always leaned toward ele, mostly fresh air tempest builds, but **literally** everything is playable in the open world. I've also enjoyed pistol/pistol deadeye, various mirage and firebrand builds and revenant. Ranger can be pretty lazy and laid back if that's what you're after (camp longbow, let pet tank). Greatsword reaper has some value, but spamming 2 got me bored quickly.
---
First real art post on this subreddit, I'm amazed
---
delicious salt
---
Don't worry dude, in a couple of weeks you will be able to play tHe IcEbRoOd sAGa
---
toxic wannabe hardcore player
---
it's internet slang, has nothing to do with actual autism
---
I will be honest. I absolutely loved WvW. Early WvW was one of the most amazing things I have taken part of.
---
Yes, I played a Guardian.
---
Yes, I loved my loot-stick.
---
i really like the irony here :D
---
Autism has been a phrase of expression on the internet for years now it's nothing new
---
You should give [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRobMMfPXlE) a try.
---
At this rate this sub is going to be dead cavern filled with trolls long before the game.
---
power reaper is pretty strong in fractals though, its short term burst is good, just falls off after.  
---
its just a really uncommon niche pick, thats why most power reapers have no idea what theyre doing.
---
There's also just toxic players, gotta love 'em both.
---
That doesn't really make it any better though
---
the funniest thing about this is that he things a "pro" team will take 7 minutes to clear 96.  
---
yeah, that guy had no idea what hes doing and tried to hide it with being a dickhead.
---
&gt;Meta player/Meta team pull ur own weight and compliment each other...
---
-plays necro-
---
Ok...
---
Oof...
---
It's a viable build for sure, but it's still not meta.
---
And if he cared about the team, he wouldn't leave at the first place.
---
What a joke.
---
I probably wouldn't of stuck with this game for 6+ years if I didnt have my close friends/guildies.
---
I would use discord or other voice chat services from now on if I were you, seems like everything you type in game can be used against you by the automated system.  
---
And hey thank you for sharing, I didn't know that you could get banned this way.
---
This person seriously has some mental issues. Someone bring them to an institution jesus christ.
---
im not sure you get flagged automatically.
---
my UK keybord has "n" next to "b" and once in guild chat i mis typed "no bigger!" once I I saw what I did I immediatly corrected myself in guild and explained what happened and I wasnt banned.
---
His friend was offended and reported him.
---
whatever
---
This is exactly what i thought too, either that or op is lyin, i have been saying way worse disgusting things with my friend in instances, and never got a ban for it
---
theyre more volatile though, so its easier to see if theyre good.  
---
they either pick reaper because they have no idea what theyre doing and are pretty bad, or because they know exactly what theyre doing and tryhard the shit out of that class.
---
I dunno buying everything drained my karma pretty good. The sirens landing backpacks for example were tough.
---
Really not an excuse. FFXIV has emotes seperated by gender and by race and they have tons!
---
Yeah this person has some serious mental issues. Someone put them in an institution jesus christ.
---
Cant unsee now
---
he died to trash mobs on 96? which part, the cannon phase? i have a hard time thinking of a place in aetherblade fractal where you would die to mobs unless literally fighting solo.... did he just eat the banner attack from the mobs and blame it on the party not being meta enough?
---
Maybe it’s also your long lost twin in real life too :3
---
It's not really that strict. "Don't say slurs" isn't exactly a strict rule. I say fuck a lot in all chat, no GM ever told me to tone it down. Banning for swears is what I would consider strict.
---
It is kinda weird that it was a closed instance that caused an issue, but at the same time I've never thought "Ah, finally! A closed instance, now I can drop some n bombs!" Though I have a feeling they aren't scrubbing through each line of text anyone has ever typed out. If I was a betting man, I'd put my money on another slur being used somewhere else more public.
---
This! This is part of why i am so excited for the new release.
---
Reaper complaining about people not running meta team comp. Omegalul.
---
Emotes are fun little content that make player interaction better. However it's also 5 to 10 more animations for each emote to create. I suppose that now that Anet has access to mocap to make the process faster, as they used with chair animations, that would be less trouble than at the beginning of the game, but creating an emote is still work.  
---
Also I suppose the process of "which emote should we create? which emote is relevant? which emote could be used for npc interactions too?" also make the process slower, and everyone is certainly really busy at Anet right now. Between emotes and creature animations for the next update, for an animator, I think the priority is not for the emotes.
---
I was explaining reasoning, not saying it was an excuse. I did say I think it probably would be worth it.  As for FF XIV, pretty sure they have a higher budget over all, just considering it's a sub game, with 13 previous installments in the series. My guess is the staff is probably bigger as well.  
---
At any rate, I'll have to take your word for it, since I'm not intimately familiar with FF XIV.
---
Is that subli?
---
What did your characters ancestors get up to 250 years prior to gw2?
---
Yikes..
---
What's your issue with lovers? Not only has getting them become incredibly easier than it was in "the good old days", it also helps with getting T6 mats, that you also need, resulting in even the "gambling fails" being progress towards the legendary.
---
I usually just dye my hero in twin colours.
---
Supergirl! @ 0:52.
---
How is that any different? What is next? Checking all whispers if it's okay with the code of conduct, even if both parties are okay with the content of the messages? Ofcourse this has it's boundaries too, but who is Arenanet to tell me what is or isn't appropiate for me and my friend?
---
Like I get what you mean, and I agree to a certain extend. But we didn't offend anyone. I see 10 times worse stuff being said in PvP by 20k achievement points characters who apparently have been acting like that for quite a while, and I get banned for this? I mean it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see what I mean here right.
---
And I agree on that there should be more bans in PvP and WvW. People in a competitive environment tend to get way too emotional.
---
They probably dont know how to fix it considering most of the staff that worked on the core game left and nobody knows the legacy code.
---
I still have 153\~ clovers, because of reward track bugs
---
I hate people who ask to use meta build. Let people run how they want it.
---
Idk... I usually find most "meta" players just aren't good at adapting very quickly; lfg "meta" groups in particular. One little things goes wrong and they are start crying "wipe, blah, blah, blah". Many of the pugs I've ever in that are set on a very specific meta end up taking just as long as groups that aren't as picky. Maybe I'm just good at organising my groups, maybe I'm just lucky, maybe it's maybelline.
---
A good player is going to be good regardless.
---
A bad player constantly trying to keep up with the current "meta" will still typically be bad, because they are constantly learning a new class, build, group dynamic. I'd just much rather take their best class and adapt our strategy to it than potentially their worst class just because "meta".
---
I think the real issue at play in groups are finding out who is looking to actually try to do their part with whatever class they play and who is just looking for a free ride.
---
People also just have off days, even in regular groups, and we don't always get a chance to know that in a random group, but that doesn't really benefit us to know in the moment either.
---
The only time I've ever found the meta really matter in most games is with speed groups that are looking to hit that world record time (maybe not officially or anything, but these are typically the most competitive and extreme edge 1 percenter groups). I guess the only other time are with more traditional multiplayer games with the holy trinity or you literally "need this one ability that is the only way to deal damage to the boss" (i.e. using a heal to damage an enemy and it's the only way to kill it or whatever).
---
I had another twin of yours as a key farmer
---
If anet was a government to a country they would be literally big brother.
---
He would have a point there if he wasn't a salty reaper player
---
Im a vet and thats spot on.
---
Don’t worry anet hasn’t even started making BT
---
Or maybe just grow a thick skin and realize that fan art is more appreciated when the game is more based on named characters, instead of your game avatar nobody cares about outside of you
---
Yeah, these narcissistic, arrogant and autistic shitbags are all over the raid scene.
---
You say you played PvP afterwards, so assuming your friend didn't report you, if you were reported for abusive chat in PvP that could cause the GM to look into your chatlog to get a better sense of what was going on and what you've been saying. If they see you've been using racial slurs, that's a ban even if you were in a closed instance at the time.
---
Don't want to get banned for what you said in chat, don't rage at people, use slurs, or tell people to kill themselves. It's really that simple. If that's what you like to do with friends, best to use some other method of communication, because all it takes is one report—either of what you said or in the chatlog timeframe mods go by—and your account is at risk.
---
well, i have ASD (autism spectrum disorder) and i don't see what's so insulting about it.
---
Wait till someone tells them about foes dropping random loot o. O
---
I agree with most of what you say, except the part about being constantly learning a new build. It's not necessarily the downside you describe. Sure, there are players like that. But in my experience these are players who think they're better than they really are. The actual good players, they do that and they perform well anyway, because they actually understand how and why their builds work, and they have the experience in both the class they play and the content they're doing to adapt *very* quickly.
---
And sure, you don't really need meta to do a comfortable daily clear. But it is a way to reduce the chances of it turning into clown fiesta. Better have offensive buffs covered, you know? Not that you can't do it without them, it's just quicker and cleaner like this.
---
USA always overreact way to harsh on the N-word, not realizing how unnecessary it often is, if not having the opposite effect on giving the N-word more power...
---
Which is fine. I'm trans, and certain things that my trans friends find insulting I don't. However, just because I don't find something insulting doesn't mean others will have a similar opinion to me.
---
If you want to call someone an idiot, there are a whole host of ways to do so without attacking a different group of people that can't choose the way they are.
---
Just kick him. I don't understand why some people still tolerate this kind of assholes.
---
Light armor.
---
Necro starter wraith mask helm
---
Leyline armor chest
---
Shackles of Madness gloves
---
T1 crafted pants
---
The one of the right has gloves hidden and I can't clearly see what chest, but legs are the same.
---
Judging by outfit alone? Enormous
---
Let's just assume it's not him because I was on discord with him. It's not just a friend from the game. It's a guy I know since highschool. I know him good enough to say it's at least save to assume it wasn't him.
---
Honestly I'm just as lost as you are and I can't do anything else but guessing what it might be. If they banned me for the single use of the word with just a friend, fair. It clarifies it for me. I don't agree at all and that's honestly just scary how much they're involving themselves in what we consider as appropiate between just the 2 of us, but whatever. I just don't know why, and every reason for why makes it really inconsistent with the stuff I see flying by in PvP which actually is aimed towards insulting others.
---
I totally understand the last part of your message, and the confusion this topic might give people and I don't blame anyone for thinking I deserved this or whatever. If this is the case it must've been an accident for sure because it's just not who I am, who I try to be or who I want to be. However, I never use racial slurs to offend others. Sure as hell might've said some things against someone in PvP who says I can kill myself, but nothing homophobic or racial.
---
We got to play it 4 years "early" in comparison that's a pretty neat feature. We got the opportunity to play S3 for free and play it immediately when it released. We also got 1 shared inv. Slot and if we owned core before we got 1 character slot.
---
Raids are too slow and might not get another one fractals are too slow the recent ones arent fun no more CM's and the new instabilities are ass. Pvp and wvw are in the same boat thats sinking.
---
I understand addiction. But arguing that he was victimised by arenanet is also completely avoiding how addiction works. This kind of phsycological addiction is internal. You can be forcefully addicted to drugs, because they cause physiological effects. Withdrawal can kill you in that instance.
---
His agency is in the fact that he can stop. With no adverse effects. It isn't any easier than quitting drugs or alcohol. Reseach shows that a lot addiction-like behaviour is caused by other factors, such as deppression. And not the medium in and of itself.
---
Banning loot boxes won't help. The addiction-like behaviour is not caused by loot boxes, or gambling, or drugs by themselves. It's predominantly internal. And what stops addiction is not stopping drugs, but providing help and counseling to get people out of addicting behavior. But to get help, poeple have to seek it out.
---
He's not a victim because he doesn't suffer. But because victimising him removes his agency to get better.
---
but here's the thing, they're not attacking autistic ppl, if ppl find it insulting then that's their problem but using autistic to describe peculiar behavior isn't a bad thing.
---
&gt; USA always overreact way to harsh on the N-word
---
it's almost as if there's way more context and history about that word in that country
---
so weird.
---
Doesn't make it better.
---
I've we did a bookcase for a couple of years now.
---
&gt; You could be voicing your concerns in a civilized manner in the WvW balance thread currently up in the official forums.
---
Why would anyone do that? Definition of wasting time when it comes to GW2.
---
Credit to everyone involved obviously, didn't even suggest it, everybody just sort of gathered and did it themselves
---
"like pro do" that was funny
---
Wtf are these dolls they’re terrifying I’m going to see them in my sleep
---
Yeah exactly, but this is a returning player. More then plenty to achieve for him.
---
The very first trash group :)
---
No, fans already made and maintain it. 
---
No need for anet to to do it, now
---
Bruh you can get 2 free mystic clovers a day from the fractal vendor, you get 2 from doing reward tracks for pvp or wvw and i believe if you choose the legendary crafting bag from login rewards you get some. you dont have to gamble unless youre in a rush. BTW the first legendary is always the roughest to make.
---
Spec would be allot more valuable if it could share some of the boons it grants itself.
---
See the thing about this where I disagree is at least with this type of RNG lootbox, you're guaranteed to get something you didn't have before, and in many cases for far fewer currency than it would have otherwise cost you.   It's the same as the mount adoption RNG licenses.  If you buy all of them then the RNG element is removed entirely because you unlock it all.  
---
I'm not saying it isn't lootbox-like because it encourages more purchases if you are going after a specific thing.  As long as they don't include exclusive things in the knife-tail gang I personally have zero issues with it.  
---
The exclusives in BLCs are the real shitty thing IMO.
---
auto-flag doesn't not automatically imply auto-ban.
---
they could have a system that scans and flags text for review, then someone goes through that list and verifies context for false positives before applying a ban.
---
Next time tell him dead people dont talk
---
This what real "Cope" looks like. With spongebob memes.
---
But, do you kill anything?
---
"they think about how they play".... no, they copy/paste a build found on the website and roll their face on their keyboard in most instances.
---
Don't bother. He's just being salty about the season 5 announcement. It doesn't have anything to do with your problem.
---
Back on the subject, there isn't much we can do aside reporting those bots. But even then I doubt it will impact the state of things in SPVP  much.
---
Okay, I don't play anymore, but 96 is aether blade, right? I don't think it's possible to die in that fractal? Or, have they changed it in the last few months?
---
Imperfectly imbalanced as things shouldn't be.
---
Reminds me of when we offered one lucky pug a free cm100 carry [and this guy ragequitted because we didn't destroy Skorvald's breakbar in 0.5 seconds.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aoJWpimLLE) We then got another pug and proceeded to breeze through it in around 15 minutes while cracking out "no cc gl" jokes throughout. The guy probably spent more time looking for the perfect carry.
---
On a more serious note, it does upset me that toxicity has exponentially risen lately. It's not uncommon to find people that are bottles of anger ready to burst.
---
i hate people like him. who cares what build you're running as long as the run gets done.
---
The Circle quest line in Dragon Age: Origins. Thank the Maker for the person who made the mod to skip most of it.
---
Thanks for sharing your story.  It's a cautionary tale that may benefit a small percentage of the community.   ANET seems to be trying to do their part to rid the community of hate speech and they don't seem to share your opinion that it's important to be able to joke about hate speech.  They problem think that it normalizes the hateful words in the community lexicon if it is not addressed, and that is a valid viewpoint.  
---
Sure some the bad behavior was in a closed instance, but what prompted the investigation was apparently someone in pvp reporting you for some other colorful language.  So when ANET comes along, they see your pvp antics *and* the instanced comments, and see behavior they don't want in the game.  
---
Seems like this was handled pretty well by ANET.
---
You are out of luck, Anet doesn't care enough to do anything about it.
---
The most funny thing for me here is that experienced groups that run CMs + t4 almost never run reaper..... this guy is delusional on so many fronts.
---
Jesus, even I don't die there and I'm trash.
---
"Pay 30$ for a tattoo, get a 30$ tattoo done by a 30$ artist" is most likely the source of what we see on this sub...
---
For anyone that took too much time to notice.. middle signet has darker background than others
---
I don't do above lvl 50 fractals. How would you feel about a firebrand? since that's mostly what I play.
---
Nah, people have married virtual girls, marrying Guild Wars 2 is not far off.
---
And I felt bad with my $500 on GW2 gems since 2013. Damn.  
---
Don't really have any useful advice for you, except maybe ask yourself what part of the lootbox you find enjoyable and maybe try to find a replacement.  
---
Personally for me, lootboxes just makes me more depressed so I avoid them like the plague. Out of all the games I play and have played, GW2's lootboxes are top-tier garbage, only beaten by Elder Scrolls Online. Everything about them is shit and the money is better spent on pure gold since that's a thing you can spend it on.
---
One Button Fight
---
Stfu dude you give raiders a bad name.
---
Was running EB yesterday with a friend and suddently he said something along the lines like "hey, just had a thought... the stuff we are currently doing didn't change since the launch of GW2, except now it's lagging a bit more".
---
Suddently i felt some kind of disgust for the game mode i love so much. :(
---
&gt; the number of slot were limited (which I highly doubt)
---
There was a dev that added a bunch of items to the material storage a while back (1.5 - 2? years ago) who did allude to the fact that there is limited capacity in the material storage and that she needed to save room for items that would be added from future LW episodes.   She asked for feedback from the community and shared this little bit of info with us. 
---
Not using personal material storage for scribe mats seems like a great decision, as those mats would serve a guild better being in a guild bank and allowing more room in personal mat storage for items like cooking ingredients.
---
The emote list from Guild Wars 1 is in Guild Wars 2 I think. It's just the animations missing. So yeah, fix, please.
---
P1: someone spawned the red oozes and from there on you have to clear all of those. No1 cleared the 3-4 gravelings at the start of the room where the scepter pieces are.
---
P2: Detha gets bugged when the player she follows dies, i imagined some1 died while running to the boss after the trap part.
---
P3: After the tunnel opens and you run for the boss you have to kill the boss really fast before the gravelings kill the nps ( he bugs if he gets killed). Otherwise you want to kill the gravelings on the path to the boss.
---
The trick to avoid all of these things ofc is to run with an experienced squad. People still run dungeons nowadays, they just do it on discords with friends rather than lfg.
---
Inb4 copyright issues.
---
To be frank: I don't care if you intended to offend anyone or if your friend was offended. I'm happy to believe that both was not the case, but it really does not matter. CoCs are not build in a way, that GMs need to guess your intention. They are build to keep things such as racial slurs out of the game and I 100% agree with this purpose. You used a racial slur, case closed, no reason for Anet or anyone to guess at what your intention was when using it.
---
There is no one who works at anet that understands dungeon scripts because every single employee aside from some that have worked on aetherpath no longer work at arenanet. It would literally be faster for them to make new dungeons from scratch at this point than to fix the bugs of old dungeons. That is why they aren't fixing anything. Basically they fucked up years ago and never addressed the fuckup and as a result decided to drop support for them.
---
You should be grateful for people like him.. The entertainment value~
---
Thats the gw2 community they try and appear like the friendliest community but as soon as you criticize the game they go ape shit been hear from the start its all a facade. I would take the dudes advice and play classic thats where some of the vets go now try the gw2 refugees guild.
---
AFAIK the WvW team wasn't hit by the layoffs.
---
2 devs before, 2 devs now.
---
They're characters from a movie (and new show), The Dark Crystal.
---
The only reason they would involve them self in a personal dialouge is if the person report you. It might be that your friend thought it was fun or he actaully really was offended but did not want to take the discussion with you because there might be something he carries with him that you have no knowledge about or he simply got tired of it and wanted you to stop. 
---
And reporting someone does not mean that you will know if they get punnished or not. And you getting a full weeks ban tells me you have been banned before or the things you said really was far and beyond. The normal thing is that you get a short ban as your first overstep and then it builds up. Unless again you really overstepped.
---
You mean, 0 devs before, 0 now.
---
Can't layoff WvW Devs if there were non to begin with.

I have been playing Spellbreaker warrior in pvp for a while now, and while the charges and leaps of the standard build ([bull's charge](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bull%27s_Charge), [dagger 2](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aura_Slicer), [dagger F1](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Breaching_Strike), [shield 4](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shield_Bash) and [GS 5](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rush))were always a bit unreliable, I feel like today they are completely useless: bull's charge overshoots by a larger margin than usual, while dagger 2, dagger F1, and shield 4 just stop short of ever hitting their target, and even rush, the most reliable of the bunch, doesn't even trigger the gap-closing/hitting animation at the end of the charge.  
---
I'm pretty sure it is a connection/ping issue (as I said they worked 70% of the time before), but I thought I would ask before: has someone encountered and fix that issue before? would a repair do it or should I just avoid pvp until I my ping goes down? I don't think it would be worth making a new post for this issue
---
I'll put up with some really bad players if they're at least nice and legit trying. I have no qualms kicking people the moment they start flaming others in the group. It's easier to carry bad players than it is to carry a cunt.
---
I’ve played Gw1 and Gw2 for years! I remember in Gw1 that I could actually build decent builds that were strong but when it came to grinding a clearing for rewards was started looking at Meta builds so I could do it faster. 
---
In Gw2, it was harder for me to make decent build I enjoyed because I didn’t get see how traits effected skills directly. Yet, I knew I traded dmg output for a build more my play style. I actually think I survived better even if took slightly longer.
---
Thanks, i will.
---
right one (op) is using vigil's honor chest. 
---

Looks like Seer's boots?

&gt; play META team..because they think aobut HOW they play..HOW their build works. 
---
Best joke ever. xDDD
---
It's strange that a dot in the email-username shouldn't be allowed - but good to know.
---
Nope, gen3 legendaries weren't mentioned anywhere (yet). Either he lied or he understood something very wrong.
---
I'd like the envoy armour skins yeah, I'll start looking at W1 and W4 now, thanks a lot.
---
Actually the dungeon door is not the story entrance. The story entrance is a green star, inconveniently located next to the dungeon door. The dungeon itself is the explorable mode dungeon.
---
At one time that was the entrance to the end of the personal story as well, but now it's not. There is a green star, quite apart from the dungeon door.
---
They really should have moved it to another location further away, to avoid this confusion because it's very easy to confuse it.
---
But also please fix other races/genders to not have idle animations during story dialogues. Just because they """fixed""" female humans, it doesn't fix the original issue.
---
Personally, i went for the wvw legendary armor.
---
You can hop in and start progressing towards it at any time of the day (im from gandara) and its not as repetitive as raids or pvp matches.
---
It also takes around 21 weeks of playing 3h per day, everyday to get the full armor set.
---
Pvp takes a bit less, but you have "downtime" when there are no active leagues.
---
Raids you want to learn the professions, rotations, encounters, find a good group or a guild with decent clear time at least, and hope you can raid whenever you want to.
---
Since you want the raid one for its skin, id say get your gear and food sorted out, learn the rotation, watch youtube guides, join a few guilds for some training runs and over time, youll make it a daily/weekly thing
---
You should have formulated it like that in your original post ~
---
If you don't have tomes to level fast, you can go to Lily of the Elon and level from 2 to 46 just by doing Cooking to 400 and Jewelcrafting to 400.
---
And then they dont comeback.
---
Can't unsee. What have you done???
---
Too much condi.
---
Too much one-shotting skills. "Don't use glass gear". Ok, I go full nomad. "Why your damage is so low?". "What? You just asked not to use glass gear". The one who can one-shot others is glass too.
---
Too much lag. Pushing into enemy blob with warclaw, nothing happens after. Not even a single skill activates.
---
Enemies have 10x blob size 24/7. Enemies reset everything at night.
---
WvW is brilliant!
---
All the meta speed clear BS really turned me off from enjoying T4 fractals anymore.
---
But srsly, how did he manage to die on reaper? Is that even possible?
---
That’s the logic of every bad player in any game. Charging 1v5 into the enemy team in a moba while team is seconds behind? Trash team. Every. Darn. Time.
---
weaponized autism is used to describe the phenomenon of collective investigation that the internet preforms and while the most high profile of such phenomenons is the greatest game of capture the flag, it's also been used to identify criminals which ultimately lead to their arrest. (and i'm talking serious crimes like assault and animal abuse, not your common pickpocket)
---
autism in internet slang is a neutral term that can be both used as an insult or a compliment depending on the context. the ppl using autism as an insult rarely have a negative outlook on ppl with actual autism and aren't marginalizing them (they're not even in a position to marginalize them) they're just joking and such negative reactions just make you come of as patronizing.
---
ultimately i think we'll have to settle on agreeing to disagree on this subject but still i think that downvoting ppl that use autism in this context or ppl defending it isn't doing anybody any favors and is kinda dumb
---
This is a valuable post that causes people with no sense of humor to angrily identify themselves.
---
Thats a Bug ??? OMFG i Actually thought anet intended that
---
In addition to what others have said, don't forget to stack other buffs, like food, utility, guild experience, any banners you can get your hands on, birthday or celebration booster, or experience boosters. There's even a black lion booster if you have any of those. Whatever gives you XP usually stacks, except birthday and celebration don't.

Somehow I feel like we're not seeing the full story...

Because it is awesome and I like to phantasize about it. Its like when you start a new game youre hyped for, before you actually play it you probably think about what Race or Class you wanna play.
---
Man that was such a fun show
---
Thanks for the reply, the general consensus seems to be focusing on raiding so I'll do that. I'll also try and fit in some fractal dailies and HoT meta's as i currently have 0 chak eggs. I'll be referring back to your reply while i make the armour so thanks again.
---
Id say warrior cause they use their 2h swords in the most natural, non magical way.
---
Their skills also feel great for a heavy armored profession. 
---
Hundred blades are super fun, rush and whirlwind is also great.
---
Guardian gs are also powerful, but offer a more magical approach.
---
Rangers gs focus on a timed burst, and evasion. Tho powerful, i never liked the idea of a medium armor profession based on range and nature to wield such big and heavy weapons.
---
Mesmers gs skills are purely magical
---
Thanks for the info

It feels a lot to me like Anet is trying to replicate that but failing.
---
Absolutely not. Why else did ANET have nothing else to show during the press conference?
---
Is snow crows going German ?
---
With that Idea, you are not making them more "interesting" though.
---
Travelling quickly to other maps is the whole convenience of the game. You would basically kill off any map jumps for Map boss events because there would be no "now jump from Caledon forest to Thunderhead peaks for the next meta" or a basic situation that you notice that there is currently a meta event going on or someone advertises triple trouble and you have to run there 20 minutes and miss it. Players wouldn't bother with it anymore.
---
&gt; What about world bosses train? Honestly who cares.
---
So, okay, let me get this straight. Just because YOU don't care should mean that nobody cares? Have you spent some time doing world boss events in the last year or so? There are many players doing it, heck even I do it from time to time when I see that one is up.
---
Respawn areas are a double-edged sword, on the one hand, you would punish someone if they die because they have to run all the way and could encourage not dying but on the other hand, as we see today, players don't bother with that at all because even a very convenient waypoint a very short distance away will not be used by many and they wait for the revive instead.
---
Map reward exclusivity would be a good thing IMO.
---
Those were only overlay templates, though. 
---
You still have to click everything

Yes!

Thank you!

Ah, I see, so nothing has changed. It was fun running around like a headless chicken in that fractal.
---
They stopped doing them because they started moving resources away, not because of this theory you have that players magically left WvW after every tournament.
---
What kind of logic is that?
---
Oh jesus christ, I actually feel sad for you... can you get your money back atleast or something?
---
Banish on guardian hammer, always satisfying to get off on a downed enemy player and used to be key to singling out players in fights when hammer guard was a thing. Punting someone off a cliff is the best finisher ever.
---
Case in point.
---
I've been playing since GW1. It's supposed to be fun playing video games.  Why so serious it's not like they hand the Nobel peace prize.  People need to lighten up and enjoy the game.  Otherwise go find something else to do.
---
LMAO
---
I'd just be happy if they made these tradeable so I can put something more useful in the slot instead.  It's not like you can craft the primers without the recipe and you can only get that buying the deed for your home instance.
---
so basically I should not care about fps since everything clearly works smoothly on max visuals anyway.
---
I was just wondering because it was important for me to know how much fps I actually gained. even in full cities it seems like my fps is super high with a lot of people around, so I was wondering if the program actually lowers my visuals or something.
---
Imagine a whale not having capped bank slots.. OMEGALUL
---
It's going to be amazing if you're new to this and playing with someone who is also new, so of course it'll be amazing and you'll love it and you won't care about the problems.
---
This has NEVER been the issue and i have no idea why you and many others seem to think it is.
---
Nice find! It's a new one. (if we don't count all the posts with that exact same bug, at least one per week if we're lucky)
---
Of course you disagree, you're still new and playing with someone who is new, so of course you don't care about the problems when there's still a ton for you to do.

Animation and visuals of a skill only go so far I think, for a skill to be satisfying I think it also needs to be good. Seeing high numbers for me is satisfying and exciting. If I can kill a mob with autoing in Axe just as fast or faster than I would with Hundred Blades, using Hundred Blades would not feel too exciting. 
---
In comparison Guardian's Whirling Wrath is at the top of its game. It has pretty visuals and animations, and on top of that, it is exciting to use the skill because you know you are wrecking faces with it and to destroy the mob there would be no other weapon skill you would rather use.
---
Np! Tbh, i enjoy more mixing and matching multiple pieces of skins to make one or two different kinds of armor sets of my own instead of the way raid armor looks like. 
---
So wvw is the best way for me.

But thats just me. :)

META is not always better than a custom build works for you. Hate people like that who demand “META or GTFO”.  Prefer to play with something I am comfortable and have fun with.
---
You need to ignore everybody in this post and sub. Anybody who tells someone their tattoo looks shitty, doesn't have one. You never tell that to someone. That being said, this is a sylvari? You can pretty easily find an artist who would add more detail to the face and make it more plant-like. That would take care of any linework or shaping issues.
---
Overall, i think it's a pretty cool idea. He just needed to take more time on the linework and blending.  [Your is slightly smaller than mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/chchhx/jellyfish_daydreams_tattoo_cassandra_clark/), so that should've been at least 6 hours.
---
Not only can GMs not know your intentions, they also can't know if the person who you were in an instance with are your frinds or what their perspective on your message is. What do you expect them to do? Retrieve voicelogs from discord to verify they were laughing and thus go "oh then it's fine"?
---
You are quite right that the scenario is rather extreme, but it illustrates a point: actioning CoC violations can be reasonable, even when non of the players present minds what was said.
---
Since you said you wouldn't use that word in game again... It kind of sounds like their system works?
---
Yes GW2 is good, we all know that otherwise we would not be on this subreddit.
---
can you please stop farming karma with these posts?
---
Thanks for your unbiased comment.
---
It indeed is a valid viewpoint that it shouldn't be normalized. This ofcourse only counts as long as people actually still have emotion attached to the word. Ideally, which is probably where my perspective comes from, all being able to joke about it removes to emotional attachment towards the word. Which in my opinion is best for everyone, since I really feel bad for people who can be triggered so easily by the words of others. That means they have a tough road ahead of them, because if you don't have a thick skin, a lot of people are going to trigger you in the world I'm afraid.
---
I also think the situation described by you is indeed the case. Could be, I don't think that there was anything serious that I said in the PvP instances, but indeed they might've looked into the log and come across this. A lot of people mention my friend reporting me and say that's most likely, but idk what kind of friends most of the people have but I don't let such people around me.
---
Maybe it's well handled for the Reddit reader, for me as the person who's banned and is with empty hands it feels like a big loss, and it also feels like it didn't really teach me anything. It wont change my perspective, it just makes me more careful ingame to prevent an identical situation. I mean in the end, however you turn it or wrap it around, my true intentions never were any harm and still got punished for it.
---
Someone tell ANet they can sell emotes in the gem store, then we'll get a shit ton next patch.
---
Nah. Having a bad day should NEVER be an excuse to take out your anger or frustration on somebody you don't even know on the internet. He is just toxic and arrogant.
---
I've been playing since release and have completed end content.
---
Must've been playing with Donald Trump.
---
Are you talking about the mystic forge?
---
This plot is one of the reasons I don't give Anet money anymore.  I use to buy about $10-$20 in gems every time there was an update I enjoyed.  But 2k gems dropped on these plots and then I lose 4 bank slots to these flowers?  Wow.
---
i wish! gearcheck would be cool too.
---
&gt;somewhat recently
---
More specifically, with the launch of LW S3E1, at least 3 years ago, or, almost half the game's life ago. If 3-4 years is the time frame for new emotes, then we're getting more with Icebrood Saga as a hidden feature. But that's just a theory... *a game theory*
---
This is showing a cooking discovery tab that, at 500, is empty. This means that most discoverable (non recipe) craftable items have been added to the crafting tab. There could be more discoverables for which none of the ingredients are in the player's inventories (especially for cooking, where many components aren't bankable), but this is quite a bit of work to have an empty discovery tab.
---
Because most people barley read the complaints and chalk us up as toxic veterans.
---
Even if that's the total number of items you can have in the material tab, that's still more than a million different potential storable items, so that's not it either.
---
I do not like this idea tbh
---
It's also a super inefficient way to do it and doesn't really look better.
---
People are doing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOBpATa1HUY) with the FFXIV emotess. I can't be that hard to add some simple fucking emotes to an MMO. Fuck.
---
I agree but that's just how some people are, on good days they can be super kind and on bad ones deserve 1st class transport to hell
---
well its still. with the overline "perfectly balanced..." , so maybe the mods didnt relised that there is a new thing upcomming
---
That's buried under years of reddit. Maybe vary a few google searches, you might find it.
---
Wow. At least we know now that a fix is coming. Hopefully it will be soon.
---
wait, you think Anet is unable to add baubbles to mat storage?  As in you think they don't know how to program it? Am I understanding your belief correctly?
---
There's no way a Reaper is doing 95% of a DH.
---
some people prefer quality over quantity :P
---
Actually, for me Timberline Falls is currently the most beautiful map in the game, even though it's core.
---
&gt; No SAB Baubles and Bubble Baubles. I spoke with the SAB designers and this is a technical limitation with how that stuff all works in SAB.
---
so it is not "my belief" but rather the quote of the devs. And I doubt they changed the initial implementation of those things just because it got a yearly festival.
---
Yeah I have edited sorry.
---
Again. Gw2 emotes aren't one bit better than the ones in FFXIV.
---
Portal, of course
---
Honestly idk why the other person tries to keep arguing that because it was only with a friend who thought it was funny, there is no issue. To their earlier statement about how anet is now restricting how they can communicate with their friend, I say ofc they can. You are using their game as a platform to communicate which means you have to follow their code of conduct. If you dont, then there are consequences like this. It's really that simple and I just dont understand why they cant see it. If they really felt that they had to make the joke, then they should've just done it over discord because their code of conduct is different.
---
They are already there at least since Thursday. Most were added on Wednesday or earlier.
---
.....are you really telling ME to find YOUR proof?
---
I just don't understand why you weren't on discord. Say all the crazy shit you want and you are fine. The banning that anet does isn't the issue. Your incompetence is the issue.
---
Yes. If you need proof, that's how you're most likely going to find it.
---
Can you fly an airplane right now? Probably not! Which means they can't add it right now but they could do the work so that it could be added when they changed the system.
---
In their current situation, as far as we know from the latest information I quoted, there are technical limitations for them that don't allow them to add those things to the material storage. Just because they could do it at some point doesn't mean they can right now.
---
so yes. They can't right now.
---
Yeah meta is overrated. Reaper is waaaaaay better than people are giving it credit for on here. I would agree its slightly off meta compared to like a dh but really we are talkin like a couple k dps difference in fractals. Sure raids its more but the post was about fractals. Plus in a group without boon support reaper is great because all the self quickness, getting 18 ish k single target isnt that bad, and 20 isnt uncommon to hit either. 
---
Also side comment i just post for "t4s" every single time in lfg and dont give a crap about what people play and i would say 90% of the time its smooth as hell
---
Stupid idea, I can see how new players will enjoy their running while other jump on raptor
---
Normally i pug Cm's with my friend, he plays HealBrand and i play Alacrigade, sometimes we get some players in our party that doesn't do anything to avoid mechanics, they think the supports have to throw evrything at them 24/7, if they get knocked back they start bitching o the chat saying we're lacking stability and sh\*t. And say that they can't dodge or they will "lose dps", i guess "logs" are more important than completing the fractals to some people... I just don't get it.
---
Kessex Hills and Tangled Depths say hi.
---
oh my gosh...I can't stop laughing!!! lol
---
https://i.imgur.com/eXr92lV.gif
---
Probably because all the good content was left in OG GW
---
Coming from WoW and FFXIV, I often find myself trying to use an emote common in either or both of them. When it doesn't work, i try another, and another, and another. After 5-6 errors of emote not found, I give up.
---
I agree that it'd be great to have more emotes.
---
Is there a reason Silver Doubloons have dropped quiet a lot in price?
---
I want a hug emote so bad!
---
&gt; They could add the SAB stuff to the wallet which would make more sense since they are more of a currency.
---
Thats a fantastic idea, they should do that.
---
good to know thanks nico
---
&gt;My guess is the staff is probably bigger as well. 
---
I am fairly certain that Yoshi has clarified their budget is pretty short on numerous occasions. I think a lot of the actual revenue FFXIV makes goes to other Square projects (like FFXV at one point). That said, they may have higher revenue than GW2. I'm not sure on that one.
---
My understanding is the team itself is also quite small for an MMO.
---
Actually you prepare by just showing up haha
---
I mean that depends on what you mean by casuals, I’s say people who do T4 fractals, raiding and tournaments and organized squads in WvW are hardcores, everyone else is a casual/veteran casual.
---
I never said to remove that content, or to only cater to casuals, what I said is the rank and reward systems in that content is designed to keep you playing for years, not to grind out in a few weeks and be done (fractal attunements and skins, raid skins and achievments, legendary armors for WvW/PvP/Raids, ranking systems in PvP etc.).
---
GW2 is designed to reward long-term dedication more than short-term effort, so that’s the way it should be played unless you want to become salty.
---
As for survival, hardcores are the least likely to spend actual money on the game, people who sell raid carries, or streamers like WoodenPotatoes, have way more time on their hands and as a result less money, so they will grind out whatever is possible to grind out. Casuals on the other hand don’t have the time to dedicate to becoming skilled and participating in regular team content, or to grind for currency, so they’re more likely to drop cash for gold or boosts to sellers or skins or timesavers.
---
Remember Wildstar? Pure hardcore MMO with a heavy focus on raiding. It’s dead and gone cause money dried up.
---
I find Sabir a bit boring but the other fights are good. The main issue is the CMs are too easy. Although, Adina CM was pretty interesting.
---
What's your idea of an exciting raid boss then?
---
FFXIV emotes are of higher quality and quantity.

Sounds like in your case he may have used you as a scapegoat of sorts, either he was the issue or one of friends maybe? And since you said something you were an easy target. Just my best guess
---
Kid doesn’t know the meaning of the word “meta” if he’s playing reaper instead of dh/weeb.
---
you really have something against thinking for yourself don't you

Yup, comes equal to the effort put into the HoT shirt.

Working on my legendary armor. What’s the fastest way to getting the Chak Eggs? I know about beating the meta, but is there anything else I can do in between the meta to get more?

Trust me when I say that everything is harder than you think.  Everything.  There have been lots of times when I've looked at a feature, said "oh, that's easy", and then spent a week on it before realizing that it's actually impossible.  Obviously, emotes are possible, but unless you are one of the gw2 devs, you won't truly know how easy it is to add emotes to gw2.
---
This is literally me. Skritt best race ever, no matter what Forgal thinks. xD
---
Those dungeons have long been abandoned by anet. The dedicated dungeon team left years ago so yeah, it is what is now.
---
I'm sorry I lost you there mate, guess I should've been more specific there.
---
Dude, we got half price on all waypoints for 4 weeks!!!
---
for fractals you'd need videos like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnDOrFTrUGQ
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTWJ2_zQAfo
---
as far as im aware they don't do stuff like that and only list classes based on their feelings, for example they invited me once to try reaper run after one of the balance patches and their judgement of the class was based entirely on my performance. 
---
and ofc they don't even update the website that much so not like you can just link them and say stuff with certainty.
---
that being said, yeah reaper isn't meta, you wont do record boss kills with it. but it's pretty close to guardian if you pull off lich form bursts correctly.
---
Endless negative posts are okay though right?  Give me a break. If they actually wanted to farm karma they'd join the negative circlejerk. People have the right to post positive or negative here.
---
Highest dps throughout all my runs was a reaper and I'm at ~700 kps now. Was pretty crazy. 38 k at the end of siaxx for example. He pulled similar numbers at each boss.
---
Tbh seeing how your handling this ban, you earned it. Your trying to fight this ban cuz you think it is ok to say the N word to friends in a non public space...how about just not using such a racist word...lol... and its 80% liky your friend reported you
---
This sounds right.  The squeaky wheel gets the hammer.
---
Your " friends " reported you is what happened .
---
They just mean the community hasn't been showing it's best side this past month.
---
"Its just a prank bro"
---
Don't worry, we gonna get some more Quaggan emblems instead like always. ;)
---
Open caches in TD. There's lots of them in every lane.
---
Check discretize website, lots of info there.
---
I'm not giving corporations the benefit of the doubt.  I'm giving the actual dev team the benefit of the doubt, because I have to make similar decisions on a regular basis.  There are always 100 things that would make your product better, and you never have time to do all of them.  NEVER.  Instead, you pick and choose the highest priority things to work on.  This means that a bunch of clear, obvious wins that wouldn't necessarily even be that hard don't get done, because you are working on some other, higher priority feature.  
---
And often times, you don't end up truly "finishing" any feature.  Instead, you implement the most important parts of that feature and save the rest for later.  You do this because you can then spend the remaining time on some other obvious, high priority feature.
---
So yeah, they only have so many emotes.  They presumably decided that the extra value they would get from more emotes is less than the extra value they would get from some other feature.  Sure, the extra value from the other feature might be income.  Speaking as someone whose salary is dependent on people paying for software, income is pretty fucking important.  If a game doesn't have income, the devs can't eat.  Or more likely, the devs quit, get fired, or get reassigned to a different game and the game stops getting updated.  If you like gw2, neither of those options are good.
---
Economy shifts all the time. Latest festival may have caused the prices to crash because of bigger supply and lower demand.

Bow of Truth, the sound it makes is so satisfying.
---
...what happened to you that I suddenly have to upvote you? :D
---
99% of groups skip tether mechanics because no one knows how it works. You dont need to be highly talented to skip.
---
The game is great for everyone actually playing the game. It sucks for everyone wanting a *very specific kind of content* that GW2 barely offered for the last seven years and most likely won't start to in the near future.
---
I agree with the other commenter. Another thing to consider is the numbers. Sure you can get lucky with the large recipe and get clovers 7times in a row and you are pretty much done right away but the likely hood of that happening is low. Imo the best reason to do recipes of 10 at a time is when you have many hundreds of coins to roll on clovers at once for the many legendary weapons you are crafting yourself. If you are like op and only making a single legendary the single recipe is the best bet to get your clovers while spending the least amount of gold (mystic coins) possible with the most consistent return on clovers. Combine that with all the other ways you can accrue clovers from pvp/wvw/fractals/logins and you probably dont even have to roll the dice all that much inthe first place.
---
I cannot remember the last update that actually "improved the product".
---
Also, we probably don't need Crafter's Backpack Frames or Legendary Shards in the Material Storage, but now that they're there, they won't be removed.
---
*cries in random lumber cores*
---
T4 players are so amusing hahaha
---
We do? All of those posts are from 2014.
---
Any of the *pull* skills, I just really like yanking mobs into a neat pile to kill. 
---
I used to play a Death Knight in WoW and I loved just gathering enemies into a slaughter fest. Reaper comes close with GS 5 followed by Shroud 4, but Guardian has some nice ones too in Firebrand Axe and the skill in Tome 1. So satisfying.
---
Not what i am looking for tbh. if i want a true challenge i´d go to classic or look for raids.
---
That is what the ideal build templates will do.
---
None of this "consume gear" madness.
---
Just a separate inventory that can holds at least two sets of every stat so you can vary sigils/runes too.
---
And if we're lucky, this can be used across characters, account-wide, so we can stop transferring sets through the bank. Build templates will save the cosmetic transmutations and auto swap them back based on the character. Then everyone only ever needs to acquire 2-3  sets of any gear set and also still be able to play Fashion Wars.
---
That may be too hopeful though, so just inventories per character that can hold at least 3+ sets of armor weapons and trinkets would be serviceable too.
---
be ahead of the game bugs and just bug the paths so you do all 3 paths in one run :) never failed me
---
just don't play weaver on 99/100 or i'm going to kick you regardless of your dps. no one likes a dps with no breaks.
---
Ive died there several times..... when I go in with out my team like a idiot.
---
No need to whiteknight, I'm just trying to be realistic here. I just don't like these overpositive posts that try to push away the problem at hand. Nothing wrong with being positive but it seems dumb to me to be like "Yeah I know the game is not having new content but I'm still having fun because I'm not at that point yet."
---
Gross.
---
that's fucking pathetic lmao. all the major hits have gigantic telegraphs and you should be pulling and cleaving them instantly regardless.
---
Sadly you get players like this, that over estimate their own skill level, and or ability, i remember doing Vale Guardian once and the commander was a warrior who got ported away and then died, they proceeded to trash talk everyone in the group about their DPS, and that they all suck, the guy died in the first 30 seconds of the fight and trash talked everyone else, needless to say the group abandoned him.
---
This is just a 'he said she said' situation, I could quote you, just change happy to unhappy and have my stance.
---
Scourge is  great healer , the safest groups would have a heal scourge , but the only problem is other healers give some form of buff (Alacrity and Quickness from Ren and Firebrand) . So them staying alive shouldn't be a problem .
---
are you saying that the majority of the gw2 population *do* have multiple accounts? it's just a simple fact that people with multiple accounts are always going to be in the minority, i'm not sure why you have such an issue with this. 
---
i did search for any obsidian shard sink topics and it came up with a grand total of 9 threads, some of which don't even appear to be about obsidian shard sinks or wanting one. https://prnt.sc/p3g2mq
---
I fucking hate these posts, they achieve nothing and just aim to get free karma by being like "Oh look at me I'm having so much fun why can't you". I just hate this fake positivity farming karma on this subreddit.
---
Idk it would look like the bad guys are sided with our guys and a bit odd - they would be facing away from the icebrood and towards the right, where the banner ends.
---
Even now they kinda look side by side but at least there's the eye tracking on which, by "reading" from left to right, you see first the good side and then the evil side
---
In term of pure heals pretty sure Scourge pulls ahead , but as you said you miss out from the boons that others provide .
---
&gt;The community that whines about lack of content, while having a plethora of content still available to them, simply because they are not interested in those content is the vast majority.
---
No, it is not and you know this perfectly.
---
See that you guys really ARE trying to dismiss everything?
---
When you compare the specificity of 'mediocre ls releases' and 'literally everything else,' I can't help but notice, 'mediocre ls releases' are a waaaay more specific a term than 'everything else' :)
---
Heh, understandable. It actually cost GW2 quite a lot of players, too. And is [quite infamous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQvSbjjFvCY) to this day, even in its nerfed form.

i agree with everything but with DD.  
---
in which world does a DD pull ahead of anything in fractals?!
---
Not my experience. So far it's all about repeatable, challenging content. Meaning mostly instanced, coordinated PvE similiar of not exactly like raids and dungeons/fractals.
---
PvP (and even WvW kind of) has valid concerns. Technically so have people desiring different content than GW2 is about, but that's warped beyond all recognition. ded gaem, trash tier company, nO ConTenT aren't valid concerns, they're bullshit from start to finish.
---
i feel very attacked
---
The new arc divider. Shit just feels (and is) so powerful and looks amazing.
---
*sigh* he means very specific content in the context of someone who plays gw2 only or mostly for pvp, wvw or raids. someone who only plays one of these and not everything that gw2 has to offer.
---
Tried the veal, and tipped my waitress.
---
there are a lot of misconceptions in youre comment.  
---
1. discretize doesnt benchmark themselfs, they just link whatever benchmark they can find, usually from SC.  
---
2. benchmarks dont apply in fractals, because the only thing that matters in fractals is shortterm burst (3-15s)  
---
so their 4m benchmark is completely irrelevant to determine strong classes for fractals.
---
Three words to disprove your whole paragraph. 
---
Domain of Kourna.
---
wait no, its the other way round here.  
---
only in the speedkill they fully use tethers, in normal kills they usually get ignored because half the squad doesnt understand the mechanic.
---
Dont worry about crafting at all until level 80
---
I'm saying that for someone who says "most people" with no actual data, highly ironic to then make comments about thinking for oneself.  You have no idea how many obsidian shards people actually have or don't have so stop pretending you do.
---
You mean NA &amp; EU. You're forgetting China's Guildwars 2.
---
But he wasn't for lack of trying.
---
Are you sure about that?
---
It is indeed an amazing game, but I wish there was more to do for us who have done everything already :(
---
So like, I hate to tell you this, but most likely your friend reported you.
---
Not every addict realises that they're an addict - and even when they do have that realisation, it can be hard for them to stop.
---
I haven't spent quite that much, but I've overspent on GW2 as well. I'm healthier than I was - I don't spend the amount I used to - but while I'm recovering slowly from my depression after seeking therapy and I'm trying to get my life into a better spot, I still struggle with money management simply because I'm autistic and impulsively spending money is a *very* hard habit to crack for my very autistic brain. It's also much more difficult to deal with than the depression because while therapy has given me coping skills and rationalisation skills for me to start healing from that, there's not really any way to "cope with and rationalise" intrinsic behaviours caused by disabilities like ADD or ASD. 
---
ArenaNet and NCsoft aren't strictly "at fault" for following a trend and I would say that blaming them is more making them scapegoats for the real problem: the law hasn't caught up with technology. The UK gambling commission for example, found that lootboxes couldn't be considered gambling because no real world items are traded and there is no inherent value in pixels as far as the law is concerned. They agreed, however, that they were worrying and troubling signs about lootboxes being exploitative. The problem now is that the law *has* to change and *has* to catch up with the technology that surrounds it, so that lootboxes *can* be identified as exploitation that is manageable by law.
---
Not even because I'm sitting here thinking that federal offices *should* manage the likes of games, or movies, or other media. I'd really rather they didn't. But the issue there is that publishers *refuse to manage themselves*. They see the exponentially increasing profits and they don't care that these profits aren't sustainable in the long term, because the share holders only care about the increase in profits too. So they exploit, and they exploit, and they exploit, and they'll find any excuse they can to continue to exploit. If the publishers refuse to regulate themselves and continue to predate on vulnerable people as they currently do, then at the end of the day, I'll take third party regulation (government or otherwise) over no regulation whatsoever.
---
To those people who are vulnerable though: seek help. If you can find/afford therapy and you find a therapist who works well with you, tell them about these problems and ask them to try and help you find mechanisms that alert you to when you might be about to indulge in a bad spending or gambling habit, and have them try to help you find ways to avoid this. Become aware of how you spend. Become aware of your "triggers" - the things you see that immediately grab your impulsive heartstrings and make you really want to spend. (For GW2 and me, for example, it's mount skins.) It's hard to do, but you have to do it: learn to identify what makes you want to spend, and learn to find ways to deal with that. If you have to quit a game for a while? Quit a game. It will suck, and it will hurt that you are chased out of a product you otherwise love, but in the long run your finances are more important than your gaming account is. Game hopping can feel bad and it can feel demoralising, and all I can say is that I'm sorry publishers value you as a human far less than they value you as an exploitable wallet. Maybe one day that will change. Until then, do what you can to protect yourself and your money.
---
Huh, that’s some valid critisim. Where would you reccomend to find meta builds?
---
I simply hold a stance that catering to casuals is inherently less important because they haven't experienced the whole game, which is why they're happy with whatever.
---

---
That's an interesting post you made because it is very polarizing. You manage to be completely right on some things and completely wrong on others.
---
Boons are indeed out of control and should be adressed. At the same time, boons have a modicum of self-moderation with them comming in all kinds of flavours: offensive, defensive etc. The issue with an overabundance of boons, barring eventual performance issues, is that they add snowball effects and the mode have way too much snowball effects now that make comebacks in a fight more and more rare. As one team loses an initial scrimmage the disadvantage just snowballs from there. That's why they should adress boons.
---
Guardians have always been a solid class and there are discussions that can be held between the roles of the different support classes but at the same time they've all had fairly solid roles in recent time and Guardians have rarely been in as fair a spot as now, where you generally want one per party and if you have more support classes in a party you generally want another class. It is rare to see full squads have more than 10 or so Guards. Instead, the real cancer that squads stack 30 or more of, with 2-4 per party is the Scourge. The Guards are not the reason we have the stale boring ranged pirate ship meta we've had for all of PoF, it is the Scourge.
---
That brings us to the last point you are right about. Indeed, the community has a hard time discussing balance these days. In part because too many experienced players are silent for various reasons and in part because most people can't distinguish between the different perspectives people have and how objective they are. That too has been muddled as the structures within the mode has been broken down (guilds, commanders, roamers etc.). In truth, to see it is not too difficult: People who create content has a more valuable perspective than those who only consume it.
---
That is pretty important given your comments since you say that ArenaNet listens to the wrong people but you seem to come from a content-consuming perspective of a player who follows tags but don't understand what the tags want. People who are not very invested in the mode, do not lead, take no part in guild activities and so on, they love the pirate ship. They love standing at range with their range class, letting the friendly support and few melee classes eat the opposing ranged bomb and getting to feel powerful from their relative safety. I can understand that they like it, it can easily bring new players into the mode, but at the same time it is nothing short of egoistic and they don't realize that such a meta makes everyone else who does all the things for them - the tags, the support, the melee, the guilds and so on - absolutely hate the gameplay and stop feeding into it either by quitting or by purposely playing less team-minded. It simply makes everyone playing less responsibly and that keeps further hurting the structures that have been built up.
---
So unless you are a commander, a productive member of a guild or small group, it hate to break it to you: Then you are the "wrong person" to listen to.
---
Yeah I don't think I will ever encounter a ban for this, since I never type anything offensive ever, but I figured I could warn friends or people in general.
---
Geez people on this subreddit are angry, if I don't run at you with pichforks and torches that must be I would do the same thing.
---
I'm on the same boat. I'm tired as fuck of branded mobs. I'm happy that there won't be any more of those. I don't mind snowy stuff except for freeze debuffs.
---
? theirs nothing to be sure about that... some mods **did** abuse their power to ban users or delete channels/server just because they personalty had something about it.
---
Who knows how often they even are in private channels/conversations...
---
Sorry but I use a personal discord server with my friends and I never encountered anything like that. And you can also use discord for private chats and private calls, no need to set up a server or break rules of a server that you don't own.
---
what the f....
---
Yeah, Healbrand is way easier to play than HealRen. That's why Healbrand is more played in pug Raid/Fractal but IMO its a good way to practice to became a great Quickbrand that could bring support has the same time than Buffing and Dpsing.
---
You only lose the block from Mace 3 and shield 4. But you still have your Aegis Mantra, the Stability Mantra and Tome F3. The important thing is to practice giving Aegis when it is needed and not giving it when you could. This way you learn what could be interesting to block and what not.
---
Sadly for HealRen, you couldn't pratice a lot outside of being the second healer in raid or just try it right in the action but that could be painfull because at start your team could have survivability issue. I start playing Heal Herald/Renegade a long time ago and I weekly clear all wing with it. But even for me its hard to teach someone how to play it because its wasnt like a Druid where you have a "Rotation" or Tempest/Scourge/Healbrand where you just spam everything. With HealRen you need to manage your energy, your CD, be on the right legend when needed, etc...
---
But damn, its fun when you master the HealRen and you have a good Quickbrand with you. Me and my friend play weekly for months even years we each others has HealRen and Quickbrand. But I completly understand how hard it could be to achieve that with pugs.
---
if you change your lfg description too often, it gets locked so you can't change it anymore...another person needs to take commander then to rewrite it. annoying when people change classes and stuff and you have to rewrite your lfg more then a few times.
---
Yes, I'm storing them elsewhere... on a mule (alt) character... O.O
---
Because I don't have enough place in my bank. But yeah, I'd be happy if we had a library in the home instance to place all the books / all books we acquire are automatically deposited in the home instance.
---
...and exactly what does that have anything to do with what I've stated here?
---
You don't have to be a "hardcore player" or "casual" to experience and complete all the content available in the game. The type of player you are is completely irrelevant to what I've talked about.
---
Also, if you're actually suggesting I'm a supposed "casual", then boy do I have some bad news for you.
---
Just made a thief deadeye and I love the kneel mechanic that changes the skills for the rifle. It really makes me feel like a sniper. Reminds me of SWG and the stances and makes me wish we had that kind of freedom.
---
&gt; they may have higher revenue than GW2
---
FFXIV has 4x the revenue of GW2.  
---
Even if Yoshi only "keeps" half of theirs, and Anet "keeps" all of it's, FFXIV would still have twice the budget.
---
Yes, didn't work for me
---
Damn, I was hoping it was something that could help
---
Something was tried, but apparently it didn't work as intended: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cuikws/this_is_the_sort_of_thing_the_wvw_community_has/exvqaqx
---
So lag is not uncommon. I have 100/100 fiber, and while my ping is relatively okay (normal is 20-ish, peaks at 70-ish during fights), I get huge skill lag during blob fights. At a rate where I can't even weapon swap unless I disengage.
---
It could, as it could not

thanks!

Give it a shot!  For many players it helps even out framerates.
---
Depending on your setup it might make your performance better or worse, but you won't really know until you try.
---
Most probably your so called friend actually reported you.
---
I'm not black myself, but my closest friend of all life is black and I use the n-word with him, heck, he uses it with himself as well. We use it all the time in whisper and all chat in instances and none of us has been banned.

Nah.

---
Add the difference is worth it!
---
Ok! Thank you!
---
Don't expect ArcDPS to fully controllable like recount in WoW. ANet does not fully support mods yet unlike Blizzard. As other comment said, leave combat/respawn golem.
---
Honestly why I never got into any competitive part of the game this kind of thing happened to me on level 1 fractals.
---
Nah wouldn't say it in map chat or LA ofcourse. Was meant specifically for my buddy. Apparently can be logged indeed, sucks for me right.
---
Valid point. I understand it that. However, it feels a little inconsistent with the /map chat I see passing by in competitive modes sometimes. But maybe this is a sign things are changing. I'm kinda tired arguing about all this at this point actually. People act like I care a lot about the ban, honestly I don't, I have to graduate this year so got plenty of stuff to do. I just felt like clarifying that no harm was meant.  Also giving headsup that stuff like this can happen because I've seen more people joking around with friends in all chats.
---
It's all about the little things!
---
&gt;Snow Crows is happy to present you the world record of Qadim the Peerless with a kill time of 3:43 (8:17 left).  
---
Like my new video roul... I gave you a shoutout
---
Don't worry you'll never run out, I have everything fully trained and have 399 left :)
---
Yea, I think its an issue with the game code rather than an issue with internet lag. Would explain why it happens on both servers and just seems to randomly pop up then go away after a few seconds. 
---
I would say I've been noticing it for close to a week now, so decently in line with you seeing it for the last 3 days.
---
Pugs... acting like pugs.
---
I dont understand why you are surprised or even shocked of atitudes like this...
---
Pug runs are a lottery, always were and always will be
---
Oh. Well, I just assumed since you mentioned your server. Sorry to see that it also affects PvE. I hope they fix it soon.
---
That's the same look my thief had since launch day.
---
I see your Bone Wall, and raise you a Beetle Wall.
---
Prepare yourself. I will enjoy the thread in a few hours so much.
---
i did my first VG kill last week, does that count as an extra 10 people playing it?
---
Not when you bought the raid
---
I just installed it on my pc (i5 2500, gtx 1650, 8gb ram) and after the game loading all the maps again i can now play gw2 on max settings 60fps instead of all on medium/low! Thanks for sharing this mod, it is insane!
---
Goodbye low effort trash 👋
---
i did not!
---
Max level asap so you can experience the elite specs. Assuming you have HoT or PoF.
---
People like this ruin the necro reputation for the rest of us :( I feel like I see this all the time
---
Take you time while leveling, slowly fight/explore your way to lv.80. enjoy the story, enjoy other world bosses (bosses like the shadow behemoth on a regular timer)
---
try different specializations, skills  and weapon skills. learn your class by playing it (you can switch around builds later on for now nothing is permanent.) 
---
if you are curious, try out other classes but dont overdue it. after finding out what you like stay on one class for now.
---
Dont be shy to use karma to buy stuff. there is somewhat of a sink for it later on, but sometimes the armor from heart vendors helps you leveling, while also giving you unique skins for looks. (later in the game there is guaranteed wardrobe unlocks, that unlock you anything from the skins you don’t own yet. so if you buy all karma skins you’ll have a higher chance of getting premium skins in those.)
---
They looked into a bestiary, with I believe the next two items.. around the same time they made the wardrobe? So that is an abandoned project already.
---
You should visit SC discord and look at moods there, displayed both by guild members and outsiders.  And also at how active it is atm.
---
Fits that he was a necro with the most edgy sounding spec too.
---
He never said that, not at all. lmao

Stacking a bunch of traps, tethering 5 enemies with a single spear of Justice or Binding Blade and pulling them into the stacked traps is always satisfying.
---
Its really disheartening that people are downvoting this.... if OP likes the tattoo then why shit on it? Let people enjoy things. I know better myself not to post any of my tattoos or personal things on here, the subreddit is full of brutally honest people who frankly can seem a little rude. 
---
OP is the only one who’s going to live with the tattoo, if they like it, then congrats! Keep scrolling instead of making people feel bad.
---
In the chat box, type "/wiki " then Shift+Right-Click an item you have questions about.
---
If you're still unsure, ask friends/guildmates for advice.
---
I hate you so fucking much right now.  
---
Edit : just realized any sane person doesn't run more than 1 or 2 so nevermind.
---
If you are a new player or returning after being gone for years, you've got a lot of content to try out in PvE.  The major complaint, IMHO, is that that ArenaNet has consistently promised things (notably faster content releases, PvP changes, etc) and consistently under delivered, which each year passing getting slower and slower.  In addition, ArenaNet's communication has gotten poor, even for them.  They tend to respond to the toxic elements of ever community but don't (probably can't) address the real questions: What is going on over there?  What are the real intentions of the game?  The trend seems to be 1) reshuffle teams promising better things to come, 2) deliver something good but not what is expected or wanted, 3) wait a long time, 4) rinse and repeat.
---
All of that said, there is a lot of value in the game.  If you take it at face value (notably for being a no-sub MMO), there is a lot to enjoy.  I've been playing since beta: GW2 is my home, and I enjoy doing things here.  Will likely be playing when the game goes into support mode.  But then, I tend to take my time with long-term goals.
---
I've had that exact experience a number of times, so it seems pretty plausible.
---
I dont know why you loved it. It's terrifying bad design within the GW2 combat system.
---
buying more slots sadly im maxed
---
While everyone will disagree with me, I think one of the worst decisions made is when they legally allowed 3rd party dps meter.  It promotes exclusivity and toxicity more than there would be otherwise.
---
Yes, there was and will be tons of toxicity and exclusivity regardless, but having tools to help you with it makes it even more commonplace and far easier to do it. 
---
Yes, having such a tool is really good and needed when theorycrafting optimal builds.  Solution is create a much better optional "golem" arena.  Not just a golem that does nothing, but a golem that actually transforms into the raid boss (or any other creature you want) and acts like it.  In that arena, have optional DPS ingame that really helps you fine-tune builds.  
---
Yes, I'm aware people still want a dps check for PUGs which by definition promotes exclusivity and provides ground for more toxicity.  Most people however still don't get that the actual dps needed for raids is extremely low (you can search posts to find one where someone wrote what's needed and how incredibly easy it is to achieve for most builds).  People are stuck on the misleading idea "that more DPS means we can increase our odds of beating the raid and that without meta dps it won't happen." 
---
Really, if you want success, work on your communication and learning the mechanics.  That's simply what mostly determines you succeeding or not.  DPS is a very minor, minor role.  
---
Yes, speedrunners (who are never worried about completion as they have near 100% success with their eyes closed) DO care about DPS and more optimal builds.  Such people are wasting their time pugging.  Find static groups.
---
"sensitive part of the community" look pal, you're the one getting butthurt over not being able to say racial slurs. Sounds like you're the fragile snowflake here. Yyyeah you deserve the ban, full stop.
---
We're trying to actively work on attitude in the Discord but can't opress opinions obviously.
---
Those emotes are cringe mate...
---
Mules
---
I'll have my 100gold now thanks.
---
I apologize for our former member's attitude on the public discord. Even though he went over to Final Fantasy 14 a while ago he still regularly visited the public discord to trash talk people.
---
True, would be good to point that out during the incredible negative storms that happen on this forum.
---
I feel so much sorrow for people with your limited mental abilities who are so blind to their own leanings they can't see how fucked up they are.
---
Load a toon you rarely use with crap in your bank you rarely use.
---
Just don't accidentally delete the toon when you have all your legendary crafting materials on it. I mean... IVE never done that but someone might... 😐 
---
(Okay...I did that. Anet was nice enough to restore my character for me) 😂
---
Add another.  I've played since GW1 Beta and have experienced almost every content in the game multiple times.  I do WvW, fractals, PvE, and much more regularly and am pretty happy as a whole.
---
* I'm having a lot of fun with [Pitfall](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pitfall) lately. All preparations look rather nice.  
---
* The changes to elementalist earth dagger main hand are really good too. Rush to enemy with 3, slam them with 2.  Always looks and feels nice. 
---
* Using Arc Divider twice in a row with Blood Reckoning is always lots of fun. It's nice to spam Decapitate too, but it doesn't feel as good as that pause on hit in Eviscerate that reminds you of the pause when hitting enemies with a strong attack that sends the enemy flying in fighting games.  
---
* It's also pretty fun to finish enemies with Launch skills like Wild Blow and Banish and see their corpses fly off. Risen abominations are not immune to Launch like other CC. So it's specially fun to see them flying off with their huge bodies.  
---
* Revenant and Daredevil staff autoattacks are always entertaining.  
---
* When male norn engineer use a Mortar, they will do a [1-hand reload](https://youtu.be/k3I7DYEmULA) move during the aftercast of the attacks, that you only get to se if you don't cancel the aftercast with another action. That makes me wish Mortar had ammo and required a reload after 4 attacks, using that short animation for it, to give the weapon a 'shooting rythm'. Like with FPS guns. 
---
* Norn forms and asura powersuits are always fun to use because of the transformations, shame the skills are weak and the recharges too long.  
---
* And mowing down enemies with reaper shroud is always really satisfying. Pop 3, freeze with 5, then 4, then finish them with autaottacks.
---
You sound like a bandwagoner more than a release player.
---
If you actually played since release you’d know the game now is night and day compared to release.
---
Release was a shitshow; no endgame content, no reward systems, no content, nothing to do. Pretty much the entire core years were about champ farming in Orr and Queensdale and ANet implementing systems like metaservers.
---
Loot was horrible, you’d get a blue and a coral tentacle for clearing Arah.
---
Legendaries were out of reach cause it took them years to get scavenger hunts out for precursors.
---
Now? There’s a crapton of content, loot and gold is Diablo-style showerfests and there are rank and reward systems in place, legendaries to chase in every slot and gamemode, collections, raids, fractals etc.
---
If anything, the game has just become better and better, unless you have the memory of a goldfish.
---
Making things is too hard. I swear it feels like ArenaNet has been stretched too thin since the game launched.
---
Two signs someone has less than 100 iq: 
---
1. THEY will use capitalization VERY poorly and SEEMINGLY at random for emphasis.
---
2. Rather than use a comma... they instead use series of periods... it's weird and pointless.....
---
I'm not saying the game got worse.. I have like 8k hours in this game, I can send you a screenshot of that. I am NOT saying the game has gotten worse in general. Just lately Anet has really been shitting the bet and it's breaking my heart because this game is my life
---
Yeah i know about the proximity tanking i just didn't know how to bait the other 2 tethering. Thanks.
---
Pretty sure that the people who made Season 1 aren't there anymore and ArenaNet has said multiple times that the amount of work needed to re-do it would be too much.
---
Do also know they said this a lot years ago, so imagine how hard it would be now after the layoffs.
---
I run a meta raid build. I just.. you know. Dont give enough fucks to actually run the rotation for it.
---
That would be a full Saga in itself, so highly unlikely. One can hope, though. Maybe someday.
---
Eventually
---
I still think one of the huge problem of GW2 is older content or features never getting any updates. It's too low priority for ANET to care, even though it would be really great to have.
---
More emotes does go in that category.
---
ANET should better balance updates on existing content/features and new content/features.
---
Anet and revisiting old content. Name a more iconic duo.
---
Sounds like a WoW player
---
they are not short staffed, just ill-managed. the gemstore and the new LS (or saga, same thing) seem to be their focus for the foreseeable future.
---
anet and poor management
---
any good tactics to slay legendary brazen gladiator counter? in 98 fractal
---
Look at you bringing politics into everything and anything
---
I would focus on locating waypoints because it's terrible if you fall and die or something and have to walk back from God knows where. You get exp for discovering more of the map, so picking an unknown portion of the map and running to it is a good idea.
---
Getting exp to 80 is also what you want as it opens up the path to all other content in the game. Hearts can give nice EXP, but the best is when a dynamic event appears near a heart since usually doing the event also helps you complete the heart and nets you lots of XP. You shouldn't rush to 80 until you feel comfortable enough using your character and are able to clear zones with ease. If you're new to Gw2 but not to MMOs, chances are you can head towards 80 much faster as the stuff would be much easier to do and you don't want to get bored.
---
Salvage mostly everything that drops, unless it's a better version of  equipment you have already. Sell the materials for a good chunk of coin on the Trading post. Once you get around level 40; you'll be salvaging a lot of pricey materials of which you can save up some gold to buy better gear. You should upgrade your gear every 10 levels or so, but don't buy the most expensive stuff (blues and greens are just fine); you want to save the bulk of it for Exotic Gear once you hit level 80.
---
Finally, you can buy food off the trading post which gives you a tiny bit of of extra XP and stats. There are many low and mid level foods that only cost a few copper. So while it's not necessary to use them, there's also little reason to not to either.
---
We are currently playing season 2 too.
---
I've recently played the main story.
---
And then watched the LS1 Summary ingame.
---
It's really a shame.
---
Where do Taimi, Rox, Braham, Cashmere and Marjory suddenly come from?
---
Scarlet was bad, I get that from the summary. But what did she do? What steam minotaurs? Why did she have Watchwork Knights from the Crown Palace?
---
I think we can see some parts of that story during the wintersday festival.
---
I understand that recreating everything is too much work, but I would love to pay to get something like an very story based fractal which replays all of the key points of LS1 within 45-90 Minutes or so.
---
For someone who came really late to this game mostly drawn in by the story + multiplayer aspect, I first found it quite difficult to get into HoT without the LS2 Story. Now I play LS2 to get some motivation for HoT story, but I feel like the most important stuff happened in LS1.
---
Season 1 would be a lot easier than a new season because all the assets are there already,  and the temporary map changes could be put in an instance or overflow map that can be picked from a dropdown menu or something. It's just that they don't want to.
---
I whisper and yell ideas here and there, reinforce the ideas brought up by others, they spread, get into people's head, build up, and with some luck they eventually they become reality. 
---
Then the devs make changes like Novelties and adding new material storage slots.
---
It takes a lot of time, tho. And so you can't really rely on it for short term inventory management. But damn, it feels great when it finally happens! 
---
[Look at this one.](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Feedback:Game_updates/20190205#Inventory)  
---
It took over 13 years for that one!
---
Total gamechanger me! I can play on all max graphics with 70-80 FPS. Without it I often played with 30-40.
---
Of course people will never be without emotion. Emotion is essentially what makes humans human. That doesn't mean that having emotions doesn't have downsides. We have emotions since thousands and thousands and thousands of years of evolution, and it has evolved itself over the same timespan. Now we are in a society that has changed so much from how we used to be in a much shorter timespan without enough time for adjustment. And back in the day, emotions were perks for survival in a world far more different then now. You could argue discrimination even comes from back then since it empowers the pact; it keeps out the strangers. But these days in the society we have they can also hold you back. And this is far from good in the society we have today.
---
Now being in control of our emotions is the most important part, as that keeps us in control of ourselves. I'm not saying we shouldn't be emotional, I just think we shouldn't put emotion in places and maybe even more importantly, in the hands of those who might abuse it. I'm also not saying I know the cure for racism. I don't, and prehaps it will vanish more passi. I just think that attaching this negative emotion towards it is like adding oxygen to a fire you're trying to extinguish. Because now it's staying alive. And while it may not be the cure for the entire issue, it might be the cure for the individual. Because refusing others to keep you down might be your way up. And maybe you should first work on yourself before you're being able to help others. 
---
Now you can twist my words, find a way to interpret this in a negative way once again. This is just my 2 cents on how I found a bit more happiness in my life.
---
Sup duude, I am Woodstock Brimstoned, hope you get enough squids to cuddle down there.
---
Ahh yes, a poster of culture I see.
---
Any update on this issue? It's also happening to me
---
Do both at the same time.
---
For that matter it may be cheaper than before, as the need to salvage lesser foodstuffs has ensured some minor value for whatever meals you craft to level up.
---
remember one principle: sell whatever you don't need now, you can always buy them back later if you ever need them.
---
Limited number of slots? How does that even work from the backend of things? And that heavily contradicts the amount they've bloated crafting components over the year.
---
Was a great time punting enemy downstates away from their group in gvgs, especially when combined with a perfect port-stomp, oh so satisfying (no idea if it's still a thing, been a long time since I played in a wvw guild)
---
definitely fractal drops
---
It's not even remotely true. But I'm out so can't look up the emotes to show u.
---
They've added loads of free emotes to get thru events, achievements, story etc. Including many dances, battle stance, ready stance, power rangers stances, boxing, fist bump, and many more that I can't recall off the top of my head.
---
yeah and he'll be kicked anyway and you'll have to leave the party
---
what does kp stand for? i am clearly a hardcore gamer
---
Ah yes, burning retreat. Always a fun time when it decides to remind you of its existence when you're spamming 4 to get up from downstate
---
As mentioned before, since people started to be a bit more hostile and discussions went off topic I've decided to remove the post before any further escalation and this becoming a time drain. Thanks for the (constructive) talks! Some people gave me some new insights on the situation!
---
Once again my apologies if you got offended. Take care!
---
Nice flex bruh
---
kill proof
---
Tornado a gimick skill who really don't have that much use in WvW, but if you want to troll enemies you equip it move to Hills and catta wall and wait for a group to come there. Activate Tornado jump out and watch the group fly off the cliff. That is the most fun you can have in WvW.
---
It's almost like cast times and reflection didn't exist at all in that format.
---
I suppose stability doesn't exist either, so let's whine about all that guardian frontline CC as well.
---
I absolutely love the new earth dagger 2 and 3 for ele, they feel so satisfying to use. Especially the 2 because it lets you move during it
---
Another favourite of mine is the guardian GS 5, pulling enemies together with it is so much fun. Especially if you catch a couple enemies off-guard in wvw and pull them into a bomb with it
---
Fractal has kp? Fractal groups require kp?
---
I never had to show off any kp in fractals. This should be changed to raid lfg.
---
Its just anything in general you get for killing something. For raids its Legendary Insights/Divinations, Legendary armor or guild hall decorations. For fractals it's Unstable Cosmic Essences which you get from 100CM.
---
Most of the time they won't when alternative is waiting 20 minutes for replacement.
---
When my friend bought the dlc's a few months ago it took days. I believe it is deliberately time gated, there will be something written somewhere about it, but I believe it was 4 days or so for him.
---
You don't pug fractal cm's very often do you.
---
For some of them, I'd agree that that's the case, however-
---
FFXIV has a *bunch* of different /dance emotes (/dance, /tdance, /hdance, /gdance, etc...). [(special dances)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bsHWh1VLys), [(racial dances)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrLPAIhsM1A)
---
However, they're all much shorter than the GW2 /dances. [(video)](https://youtu.be/Hk0xZqUuNNk?t=7)
---
The GW2 human dance is about 36 seconds long, while the FFXIV male Hyur (human) dance is about 5 seconds long, and the female is about 4 seconds long. The special dances seem to be a bit longer- the harvest dance is about 10 seconds long- but still, they're much more repetitive than the GW2 dances.
---
It's basicly the same \*shrugs\*
---
Fractal 100 Challenge Mode has kp at the end, you can exchange them for cosmetic infusion.
---
I've got a Sylvari ele called Twiglock Trombone!
---
Don't see why everyone thinks it's funny to bring politics in where it doesn't belong on Reddit. Trump jokes are a dead horse, and there are better subs to post political humor than Guild Wars 2.
---
A Sylvari who tries to act like a Charr...that's a hell of a mental image. Good luck to him lol!
---
can relate. When I used to raids, with 1200LIs I invited some friends of less than 50lis. They did great and even outdpsed some groups, so they didn't get kick.  
---
kps/lis are worthless. What really matter is player skill.
---
Post HoT legendaries were always released with LS episode. This one on 17th is not actual episode. Rather prequel.
---
...and then people wonder how it can be that cultures take a nosedive because taking things too far.  
---
biggest example: google mumble rap and have fun. if thats what people strive for today and kids think its cool and want to be like this because its art...then good night. maybe not all muble rappers fall into the whole cliche, but for the most part, i'd rather not say it.  
---
i may dislike tattoos in general, but i still can see a difference between something done with love and quality vs some shitty job.  
---
that "artist" which did the tattoo should work a bit more on his skills before going ham like this on another persons body tbh.  
---
..and is was op's choice to post it one some pseudonymous forum, so he should expect all kinds of opinions on it. if you get a tattoo, you aren't going arround the city either to give a shoutout to everyone about your new tattoo, right.
---
When a WoW player tries to play GW2
---
Sadly it's dead and buried now due to power creep, rest in piece. It was a good time.
---
Now kiss
---
That's probably because you don't do the tier 4 ones or CM 99/100. Literally every single LFG ad in that section will have kp requirements because even if someone personally doesn't care about it, they will soon come to understand that people join faster when you have kp requirements because they assume there will be better quality control.
---
My static sometimes replace the druid with heal herald, it gives fury and might x25 to 10 people and good healing. Downside is you miss the spirits and some mechanic handling that the druid can do, that youll have to replace with other classes (pushes and pulls on chrono, spirits on soulbeast).
---
Yeah as of recently I've heard of people gatekeeping based on KP which to me is silly. If you don't give people a chance to *earn* KP in the first place, how are they ever going to get any experience?
---
I have to run with guildies if I want to bring my DE, META only gets real toxic after a while.
---
I encountered someone I knew pretty well from raiding together. He was commanding normal dhuum 80kp and it was so fucking obvious that he tried to carry his completely oblivious friend through it. Entire squad was annoyed but he didn't give a damn so we all blocked and left him.
---
Spectral grasp+reaper shroud 4. Incredbily fun to melt a group of mobs at once.
---
By looking at him:  
---
\[ \] Stays alive  
---
\[ \] Does mechanicks  
---
\[ \] Has good dps/boon uptime  
---
\[ \] Knows his class and abilities  
---
\[ \] Doesn't flame  
---
\[ \] Gives advice, and ecourages those who struggle

Probably You are 14 - thats your problem.

Well, stealth is fine, permastealth, nope, no good, getting stomped from permastealth is terrible, unless ANet bothers to give more classes some reveal skills
---
it's not that bad tbh, the eye cancer, I mean, you get used to it, but not knowing that something is coming to wreck you is way worse
---
by playing with them. XD
---
It’s technically a trait, but Death from Above on Warrior. If youre defending a keep or tower in wvw from a blob that is using rams or close catas, jump on them from the walls. Then escape. Then jump on them again. Then escape. Then jump on them again. Love it.
---
How did Nico know when the shark attack happens to invuln it?
---
I don't understand why I wouldn't USE these things. My KP is my guild hall I guess :|
---
It's about lording your superiority over them, not helping them out.
---
Thank you what a champ.
---
You should make a post out of that picture, or not, you'll probably get more upvotes than me xD
---
anyone can fake kp.  
---
im ok with that as long as you carry your weight. some people are fast learners, doing it once or twice will get them up to speed. i faked my kp on cm fractals until i dont have to. its not a big deal.
---
There are literally never any 'no kp' or training runs that don't require you to join some guild that says they're a training guild but they just bring the same people each week and don't have room for you "but we hope blablahdude will have group 2 running next week" indefinitely. The only way you can get in is to be brought in by friends or guild members, the gatekeeping is so bad. 
---
"Well I did it and you can too!" is so disingenuous. What people actually mean by this is "I suffered through this shit and you should too!"

You could have stopped listening to him at necromancer who judges other people's builds
