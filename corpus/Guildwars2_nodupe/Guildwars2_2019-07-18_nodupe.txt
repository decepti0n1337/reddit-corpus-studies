I remember people trying. I remember it being a meme that never took off. Have a link to a benchmark for Condi ele before PoF?

if you like quests and dialogue, try swtor. objectively the best story of any mmo, ever. the actual mmo is an alright wow clone though. really wish they had just made it a singleplayer game, the story is certainly good enough to be one.
---
Ahaha...oh...boy...do I have some bad news for you, fellow newcomer.
---
Maybe try [Nike's open world Tempest build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsDFJbabNTc).
---
Pretty sure you're right and they must have a heavy consideration on monetization, but I guess it's also a tradeoff. If gw2 becomes a Raid heavy game, people like me will be unhappy and will leave and complain. Either way, some portion of the player base will be dissatisfied, it's ANET's responsibility to choose the direction for the game, good or bad. For me, I don't have much to complain at this point though
---
Ya'll are hella spoiled compared to other games. Seriously, trust me. Every single fanbase of every single game has complaints about a game's content, and a lot of them are legitimate. But all considering, ANet does a pretty fantastic job of content updates. The people who pretend like the game is dying, or that ANet is dropping the ball in the MMO market are living in a different universe. You would be hard pressed to find a team more in sync with the community than ANet. Besides maybe Warframe.
---

---
But for real, play any other live service game and you'd be really hard pressed to find a better value. Also, the monetization in this game is much fairer than other FTP/non-subscription games.
---
GW2 is a consistent performer on the MMO market, and in a rapidly dying industry, that's saying a lot.
---
... Christ.

Oh I agree. I have many, many hours poured into GW2 (particularly in my college days). I still go back from time to time. The point I was trying to convey is that while a lot of people find that type of endgame more than enough, a significant portion of MMO players still prefer the traditional ‘WOW-type’ formula. The constant gear progression. The ever moving proverbial carrot on a stick. The never ending chase. And I think that’s why GW2 will always be seen as kind of a niche MMO. I don’t mean niche in the ‘lesser-known’ or ‘less populated’ sense, but niche as in it will always be a different kind of MMO for a different kind of player. Which is why I don’t ever think it will ever truly be able to beat out the ESO’s, FFXIV’s, and WOW’s of the genre. At least so far as community perception goes.
---
You can't mix and match attribute combinations in the PvP interface though.
---
Competent leadership, expansions, drop the LS model, engine upgrade, better marketing (no not twitch, actual marketing, this would be easy if they had new and improved stuff to show in said marketing). there is a whole lot of stuff gw2 doesn't have but the big one is just competent leadership, if they had that then the others would mostly fall into place.
---
reaper, i like doing damage and i like not dying, it ruined other classes for me.
---
Thanks dude, the prospect of getting a dragon this early seemed too good to be true anyway :(
---
Have you tried staff ele? Staff has tons of AoE, which is of course quite fitting for open world content.
---
Did you get the DLCs? Or you planning to ESO+ it?
---
aint no laws when your riding claws
---
I am not suggesting that we trade full elite specs for a new set of skills every 6 months to a year. I agree that elite specs add a lot to professions, and can change how a profession works and feels. But even full elite specs get pretty dry after 6 months. I have an 80 of every professions and have every elite spec fully unlocked, I wouldn't say I'm a master of them all by any means. The current system will only satiate people, if they have an alt of every class and swap between then. If you like to main a class or even two, 3 years is far to long to wait for new skills.
---
Thief because it's absurdly fun to play, feels very smooth, is hard to master and you rely on having reflexes and good positioning. I really enjoy the theme of the class too, I think the thief archetype is cooler than your typical assassin edgelord class
---
Most likely, yes. Still, a man can dream.
---
I got the deluxe digital, i need to make sure i can set the movement and view similar to GW2. Certain MMO's have odd camera movement and if it isn't as smooth as GW2 i may not be able to play it, hope that's not the case after dropping 100 on it.
---
Your "facts" come across as a combination of weak and dishonest.
---
For example you state that the earnings in the PoF period are higher, then cherry pick 4 quarters and claim they are "significantly higher", but you don't give us actual figures, now why is that? 
---
The answer is because there is less than 3m difference between your two periods of comparison, that deception alone shows your bias and dishonesty.
---
So contrary to the picture you try to paint, they basically made the same over the two periods there is not a meaningful difference.
---
So fine if we take that we could say that isn't bad, doing approximately the same revenue in the latter period as the earlier one shows the game is holding steady. But there are a few problems with that...
---
Firstly the big decline in the game's playerbase happened before even HoT, then HoT basically finished off the job. So it is not like the HoT era revenues were actually good, they were of a game not doing well, so sure the revenues have held, but they are still of a game not doing well, which brings me to the next point.
---
And to highlight these revenues are not good let's add some context. Let's take Q1 2019, GW2 is doing roughly 25% better than Aion... That should be a clue to why people say the game is not doing well, even more so for a game that is supposedly one of the few big MMORPGs left.
---
I'd also suggest that GW2's revenues holding at around the same over the PoF era is actually in large part down to better monetization with things like mount skins and they are simply getting more money per player, but with less players overall. Which again is why players say the game is not doing well, doesn't mean much players spending a bit more when PvP queues are laughable, raid guilds are collapsing, T1 WvW is like T5 from a few years ago, people struggle to complete old zone events because of lack of players,  etc.
---
As for your GW2efficieny I can only laugh if you seriously think that is evidence of player numbers. Anet don't release player numbers and just like every other game that doesn't and conversely every game that does, there is a very obvious reason for that. ;)
---
When kids are asleep, since the newborn wakes up randomly, I cant get too cozy on my PC. So I havr been playing on my phone to get daily's knocked out and get some form of playtime in.
---
Steam link app works relatively well. The touch controls take any ability to play pvp out, but for pve its playable. Mainly been running gathering routes or silverwaste meta since it's easy enough to run around grabbing lost bandit chests.
---
How is it too early. Episode 6 released on May 14th. We are passed July 14th meaning we are passed 2 months since episode 6. Anets internal release schedule is 2 to 3 months that means they have till August 14th before episode 1 of season 5 is officially delayed. If four winds releases on the 30th of July that means episode 1 is officially delayed.
---
"Visibility during combat is a big problem for new players"
---
Yeah and literally 95% of that issue has LITERALLY NOTHING to do with auras or armor, but in the design of the skills themselves and the cluster fuck that it becomes when 50 people lay down various AoE, etc.
---
When was the last time that ANY episode of the living story came out in 2 months. Someone says something a couple of years ago, which hasn't happened since it was said, and you're still thinking that it's going to happen now?
---
The 2-3 month release cadence is probably a best case scenario. A few episodes didn't even make it into the 3 month release window. It's too early based on what's happened. If you base anything on what's said a year or more ago, you're just not paying attention. Look at the time between every episode in Season 4.
---
And you can beat all Living Story content one handed on your phone.
---
And also the Sylvari Grasping Vines ele.
---
Obviously it’s one of the more squishy builds, but it’s a little a case of git gud. Ele survives by kiting and never staying in the same place, rather than facetanking or even dodging. Dodge out of big telegraphed things and unpredictable attacks and walk out of everything else. If you’re playing power tempest in open world run dagger instead of scepter for weakness procs and movement with dagger fire 3. Other than that I usually play the exact power tempest meta raid build, and once you learn how to kite mobs while casting overload air, you won’t really die.
---
People want UW combat to be exactly like normal combat but realize that isn't possible.
---
Because the other people drive the community aspect, bring in more players and ensure longer term engagement with the game.
---
I'm basing it off what was said by MO in 2016 yes and until Mike Z the current game director comes out with an official statement saying the schedule has changed from 2-3 months to something I'm going to listen to the company not the community.
---
And it has pretty much nothing to do with auras themselves, but the skill effects being cast
---
How about listening to experience? Again, when was the last time it's come out in 2 months?
---
Well this last balance patch sent me packing until i get some kind of sense they have their shit together, and i've been here since beta. I won't spend another dime on a game that completely ignores the opinions of their community or treats their player base like lepers when it comes to communicating their plans or changes. I mean what exactly is the point of putting out the balance patch notes a week in advance to get feedback but never show up to discuss the changes and even more than that not change a single thing before it goes live. That is 100% the attitude that needs to change and if they start bleeding revenue things will change or there will be more interference from ownership.
---
I love GW2, i just hate the way they manage it, and i hate their inability to be upfront and honest with the community!
---
I hate how weapon swapping looks, so Rev was supposed to be my heavy armor class. I was so pisses anet took the easy path and added weapon swapping after people complained. - this is a quote from someone on this very post. And there are many more explaining their dislikes about the weapon swapping mechanic. Either way you proved my point in assuring me you were in fact a troll.

I've written a script that automatically updates arc if you're interested

Actually you're selling the wiki short. The wiki has a ton of information about a ton of subjects, including a ton of stuff not available in the game. Just one line from the wiki for example:
---
Outfits can be previewed in the Equipment Preview, Hero panel (if the outfit is not hidden), or the Gem Store Style tab.
---
It's true it doesn't say you can preview dyes, but the dye page does:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dye
---
I've played a LOT of MMOs, and I've not found too many that had wiki's anywhere near as complete as the Guild Wars 2 wiki.
---
&gt; The whole "I was there" thing sounds cool but it's content that, as far as things are going now, I will never be able to experience.
---
As someone that "was there", it sounding cool is really the limit to it.
---
It's one of those classic cases in game design where a concept sounds revolutionary, but when implemented invariably falls flat on it's face. It doesn't enrich the player experience at all.
---
When you inevitably quit playing the game, feel free to send me stuff from your acc :)

Right before PoF (8/8/17) FGS camping condi tempest became a huge meme that DID take off for a bit, how don't you remember that.  But even before that condi tempest was already a solid build for a few months after they made traited arcane power share burning.   https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6tumlb/qt_updated_benchmarks_and_builds_for_all_classes/
---
The big problem we have no idea what the future of the game is. What content will we be getting? What are they going to focus on? What happens after the restructuring?
---
I think the game is doing really really well. I am worried that they are making decisions about the content to continue developing and I don't know what they are.
---
Into the gemstore...
---
I really hope we get a big expansion/LW with more underwater content. Water themed with underwater mounts, swimming masteries to give us some QoL fixes for combat/motion underwater and some more attention on Profession skills.  
---
I think the biggest issue with underwater combat is that players use the same traits as they do on land and none of those support their underwater skills (or maybe some do but it isn't clarified-- like healing traits).   
---
I love GW's underwater realms and I would love it if we could have different traits set up for underwater that swap automatically, some masteries *(riding currents like Ley-lines?)* and more love and attention for combat skills *(everything doesn't have to be a "sink, 100 stab, rise, smoke screen, etc" - update core water skills so that they are on par with the depth of elite skills in today's meta).*   
---
I think we could get some beautiful and creative fights in future releases if they pump a bit more energy into this part of the game. Masteries that improve swimming could even make fights more dynamic and distinct to the on-land routine!
---
It certainly has less unique flavor than, say, Mesmer. But Necromancer is really just a generic death magic character. Elementalist is a generic caster, etc. If you only want the most unique classes here's what you do: Mesmer, Engineer, and Revenant. Then you're sad every balance patch, but your head's held high in that you only support the Finest Ideas.
---
Now, I meant that all tongue-in-cheeck, but seriously, Warrior is very clearly meant to fill that generic fighter role. With that said, and as someone who has been thinking like you are now of it as boring and bland, I really like it particularly when it comes to Berserker. Because yeah you're mostly generic, but you have these big epic attacks that deal crazy spike damage that you only get when you fill your adrenaline bar and go nuts. And hey, if you want something unique, Warriors can equip rifles and Gunflame Berserker is also fun. I just tend to enjoy Axe/Axe more because of the fast hits and Decapitate on the berserker burst.
---
&gt;There are plenty of "dead" games that are doing fine financially because their cash shops rakes in loads of money.
---
If a game is raking in cash, then it isn't dead.
---
An unprofitable live game is going to get shut down, no matter how many people are playing it, and a shut down game is dead in the literal sense of the word, not the hyperbolic.
---
This was my thought too lol
---
Yea, they'd have to extend the PvP interface to do it, but hey, maybe PvP would want that sort of change as well.
---
It just seems like they've got 90% of the work of temporary gear figured out, they just need to do the last 10% to make it work.
---
I'm donno, just seems like anet heard ppl complaining bout chronos literally being required for every single endgame content so they try to bring some diversity. Same thing already with "DPS" class, there's still no one single dps class, it's a collection of different classes and each with slightly unique thing about them.
---
I’m a ranger main, in the order of condi Soulbeast, Druid and power Soulbeast. I have high latency (350ms) so I’m grateful condi Soulbeast is such a forgiving class. It’s the dps I do fractal CMs on. 
---
Compared to dps I don’t play my druid as much, however I am very experienced with the class and will bring it out whenever my Fractal pugs need healing. Part of the reason I don’t play druid as much is because Druids received the chrono treatment: more work just to reach previous levels of effectiveness. I’m just glad I learned to play druid during a time when it was a lot easier and cheaper, when Magi was still relevant. 
---
I’m currently learning to play power Soulbeast with hopes of playing it in CMs. It’s a challenge as it doesn’t agree with my high latency much. The high burst numbers with successfully executed rotations is addicting though!
---
Good for you. How blissful contentedness with gw2's functionality is a playground must be. 
---
You're not the point of anybody's posts in this thread, but your enjoyment of the game is valid. 
---
However, the point of this thread, and my comments in this thread specifically, are to address the malcontents in the community, and the wavering validity of their complaints. All I'm saying is that people who are holding out hope for a brighter version of the game are misguided. What we've got is what we're getting, because people like you, for no fault of your own, have provided the revenue stream Anet was searching for and consequently latched on to. The game's course used to be set in a different direction, but heart of thorns failed in a way path of fire hasn't, and so we live in the era of mount skins and pressing f on nodes being the primary content in the game. 
---
I'm glad you're happy with it, but I'd wager your enjoyment of the game is quite a bit less conditional that people more passionate about the varying gamemodes. Anet probably has to spend far fewer resources to keep you playing than they do people who play the game for literally anything other than open world and the feeling of being in a barely-social-space. Fewer resources than they undoubtedly have at their disposal.
---
I agree that this game definitely needs more buffs than nerfs. Nerfs are useful when certain things are crowding out the rest, but buffs are what makes games fun, and at the end of the day, this is a game! In this game, what we need is more build options, so buffing underpowered builds, items, and traits would be a lot more exciting for players than just nerfing the only build we have simply because there are no better or other choices. For example the runes of the grove sound really interesting when the runes rework was announced. It could provide a way for underrepresented supports to give out these boons that can make them on par with meta supports. But instead this passive has a 90 second cooldown for a short boon duration. Uh nvm im not gonna use this rune, or play this support anymore. You can nerf the meta support all you want but im still not going to play it.
---
On the other hand I feel like this game just nerfs your build or class to make it feel worse or clunkier and it just feels bad. Then you hope that they notice how bad the class feels and you’ll get a buff the next patch. Then when the next patch comes months later, only for nothing to happen or more nerfs are applied to your class. It gets boring, stale, and there are no innovations for creative builds because everything else is simply bad or boring.
---
How exactly? I auto attcked as best as i could while spamming elements but only got 18k.
---
And still top DPS in raids.
---
These shinies are not cheap. Despite all the eye pain, it's one of the things that make the game profitable. Being able to turn it off for others reduces the value of those items and could possibly reduce profits. There is a bright side to this malady though. You can tell which toons just slapped on some infusions and think they look a million bucks, and which ones are actually well thought out and beautifully designed. Kitsch vs art, class vs crass.
---
I think you're way off base here. Anet didn't find a group of people who bought stuff and latch onto it. Anet designed the game for a group of people who have liked it pretty much for the start, you're not part of that  group.  
---
Anet has spent a tremendous amount of resources to keep me vested in the game. They're adding story and zones, and that's a lot of resources.
---
I play every single aspect of the game except raids. But I play them casually.  I'm almost level 900 in WvW. I'm level 93 in PvP.  I own the PvP legendary backpiece. I own the Fractal legendary backpiece. My fractal level is 97. 
---
But I don't run anything like that hard core. I'm simply a more casual player. I jump in, do some stuff and leave. Sometimes I get into a bit of a spell where I'll WvW for a week or two, because I'm having fun and then some festival comes out, and I move to doing that.  My game experience IS conditional. I just have different conditions. My guess is if they made the game you wanted, I'd be gone, because my conditions aren't met. I've left a lot of other games in the past because my conditions weren't met. This game just happens to provide for my conditions, while ignoring yours.
---
  
---
You're trying to paint yourself as more discerning than me. We're just interested in different outcomes.
---
I haven’t reinstalled it on my PC yet but I guess it’s MMO time

---
My FoV is maxed, but I'll check the LOD. Thank you.
---
I agree skills are the biggest culprit. It just all comes together into this massive cluster and can be quite overwhelming.
---
Same for WvW
---
Pretty much. It actually is not really fair comparison. I doubt arena net is losing sleep over it.
---
So do you hate that they don't work on the game for free, or simply that they don't work under duress? Realize that as Guild Wars 2 content has increased, their work output has remained relatively constant, meaning that whatever they do or release will continually seem smaller and smaller than what they have already released. Specially if they've lost a third of their workforce and have had to readapt.
---
Hellyea air 5 is the best cute little blob

Thank you for posting that link, but I would like to also point out that [Jawgeous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTroiYP2C7Q) is also leaving GW2 for FFXIV so.... *shrugs*
---
My only motivation to play thief is that I really enjoy how it plays and that the fact of that every other roaming profession that you encounter will have advantage makes it a good challenge.
---
It's still pretty frustrating sometimes, but I think thief is the coolest profession to play, even when Anet fail to balance it accordingly instead of nerfing or changing stuff that they really shouldn't.
---
I can't say I'm the biggest fan of the horns and hair combo but I do like his overall look! It's nice to see people who do something cohesive and put together a nice color combo instead of slapping permafrost or shadow abyss on an outfit and calling it a day.
---
Welp there goes my power staff weaver life again :(  
---
It was short lived, but thanks for letting me play with it again last night :x
---
ANET has way too many employees for amount of content they put out.
---
I  just cannot fathom how they can make 10 000 gemstore items but take multiple years to release stuff like new raid wings and WvW alliance update
---
I can't help but their recent layoffs were related to this, they have too much work force doing nothing. Not to mention the living world episodes haven't even been increasing in quality rather being something you can play through and forget about. Guild wars 2 is a franchise that needs to amaze people and break boundaries like they used to, not be whatever gemstore-mediocre story spam game.
---
I only log in once a day for the login freebies and log right off.  Takes me under a minute.
---
&gt; I never even said that. I just said that they seem to be doing fine financially
---
Not if you compare them to pre HOT. In fact they axed the way of doing content in LS1 because it apparently wasn't profitable enough, yet the ongoing earnings in that period are far greater than now. And the increase in earnings from both expansions was paltry when you break it down to how many actually bought the expansions. Like the previous poster said the increase in revenue post POF was clearly due to mount skins and that is clearly in decline now. Couple this with the inability to produce consistent content and the LS model becoming stale.
---
The game is not dying but its stale and in decline and clearly falling behind competitors.
---
One day, though! :)
---
Also worth remembering that's a blatant lie lol
---
People have been saying that last paragraph of yours for literally 5 years now.
---
Just did a few hours of wvw with my condi build and it feels so much stronger now than it used to. Good shout out.
---
I enjoy Trailblazer Scourge the most. Being able to solo everything, including mushroom hp in Tangled Depth and Balthazar hp in Auric Basin is amusing. The build is overkill 99% of the time but damn does it feel food. It is a pain to gear though if you don't raid since the insignia and conscriptions are from Kourna.
---
That's because most of the people on reddit (not all of course) are jaded and bored.
---
No one game can keep you occupied when you spent so much time playing it.  Just like a TV show.  If all you do is just one show and then watch the repeats over and over, chances are you will get bored and start finding problems everywhere.
---
That's why there are multiple TV shows so you can actually watch other stuff while they're working on new episodes.
---
Same thing here.  Most of these players simply need multiple MMO games (or other genres if they're open to it).  At least 3 if not more considering the amount of time many players spent in game bored or bored on reddit.  Play them all at the same time or switch between them as you exhaust the content on one.
---
Most things are centered around boredom.  That's not to say the game is perfect or can't use improvement.  And suggestions for it are good so developers know where to focus more.  And feedback is good so they can refine.
---
But things like the game dying and "everyone is quitting! Me too!" is just silly.  Such people should quit TEMPORARILY.  Go find multiple new games.  
---
There are a number of exceptions to all this but that would make this post even longer.
---
&gt;  I think ESO feels a bit more like a world than GW2 does
---
I had the opposite feeling. The quests in ESO are amazing in terms of storytelling, but the actual maps feel pretty bland and are really plain. I enjoy ESO a lot, but I think exploring the world is way more enjoyable in GW2.
---
Also unrelated but ESO's combat kinda sucks
---
You're so depressing
---
I love dragonhunter for just running around open world. Pull a huge group of mobs and burst them all down pretty much instantly, then continue on your merry way. It's a great feeling.
---
So I started off pretty noob, and my first toon I played for all content (story/open world) was full zerk sword weaver/dd base ele. I thought I was just bad until I made a mesmer. Holy, ele is really, really not a beginner class. I do run the raid sword weaver dps build in open world, and generally it’s pretty good for me because since I’ve become used to being hyper aware of positioning/dodging it’s not that bad. I carry a staff for ranged opponents/mass aoe and generally drop one of my more under used utilities for arcane shield. If I need to tank, I’ll run the elemental elite, usually earth. Using water or earth instead of fire is also a good idea, at a dps loss but grants lots of good sustain. You could also swap out air, but since I really like FA it’s not the most optimal for me. Gear wise there are a few good suggestions people have, I just keep the same zerk/Assas build I have now. Tempest is also really good for open world if you don’t want to play weaver, and is definitely easier to live with.
---
I like Scepter/Focus power Weaver.
---
Blasting things for 11k with Plasma Beam :D
---
well on the bright side - I swapped some traits around on my ele, and now i pulled better numbers. \:D/  
---
You can still off-set the missing 5% from the fix to raging storms by moving to arcane's bountiful power with just 3 boons on you for the 6% if it stacks on a 2+2+2
---
Possible? Sure. At all relevant or worth running? Absolutely not.
---
i don't think having a veteran oriented forum is an "issue" but that's another story.
---
i understand the viewpoint as a casual player of the game...but... *something* isn't right rn. 
---
I know im biased and a tad bit butthurt being a longtime player but as it stands, exactly what you've mentioned is exactly why arena net *deserve* the attention they're getting currently. 
---
you've never once raided &amp; don't have time for wvw- but **just because you have 1-1.5 hrs doesn't mean you're locked out of raids or wvw**. Clearly, there's nothing even remotely enticing about those modes for you to even 30 minutes into. There's no support, no insight into the future of those modes. 
---
quite frankly a lot of the gw2 playerbase doesn't care about raids rn and wvwers are absolutely distraught with the way they've been treated. It's not even about casual vs veterans.
---
hell i don't even raid or participate with any of the ***5 GUILDS i'm in*** because gw2 has lately created such an anti-social playing atmosphere around in an MMO. 
---

**tldr:** i'm genuinely sorry if that read like i'm coming at you sideways and apologize. 
---
it *feels* like Arena Net said "fuck it we'll do it live" and just gave up nurturing their customers for ONLY the bottom-line. but i know that's not true but if only they'd be more vocal, then a lot of people would reign it in on the negativity and doom-saying.
---
It's happened before
---
Damn. Didn't know how bad I wanted an elite spirit weapon until now.
---
Thats all good and dandy, but the game still feels lile shit to play to me. Not because its a bad game, because it isnt, and I love the game, but ita ANet for me. I'm quite done with ANet honestly..
---
As a player that has played this since launch I feel like all the time invested at the end means nothing. Anything pretty, you better pay for it.. wanna have fun with some PvP? Good lucl vs Mirages and one shot shenenigans everywhere.. WvW hasnt gone from the 3 same specs ever since PoF and what has ANet done to correct any of this? Balance patch every 2 months mostly for bug fixing and some reworks that at the end where just QoL and some not even that..
---
Its like Tpot said, amaizing game but a dog shit MMO
---
Thank god there is League and TFT for me, I wont log in until new story comes, and even then its a big maybe. Since 2016 I've had breaks, and this is feels like one without end
---
The only good thing is that I know if I decide to come back I'm ready to go straigth away with my gear
---
Hardly. I just find it amusing when people find the need to announce they are quitting something like it should get some sort of reaction other than "ok, so?"
---
Is it not possible to make it invisible to enemies/ only visible to friendlies?
---
What was the point of dragonbash? Just started playing again a week ago. Did some events and all I really got was some lame ass candy which was more of a pain to use then helpful
---
I think the image covering your chat box probably puts it as well as I ever could

---
Some of these are ofc better than others, but PU used to be pretty standard for shatter mes to run and still works pretty well on core roamer mes if you invest.
---
Currency sink?
---
That revenue mostly comes from gemstore sales. And in the recent years, gemstore had more updates than any other game aspect. As others already pointed out, that only means that Anet is successful at milking people who fall for it. I don't feel that this's the kind of success I can be proud of, as a semi-hardcore GW2 player.
---
Isn't that "uwu but Anet is just a small company, be patient with them" a meme at this point? I can support Anet when they deserve it, but currently they're deserving this uproar honestly.
---
I said before and I'll say it again, I consider GW2 one of the big 3 popular MMOs (alongside ESO and WoW), these MMOs are not dying anytime soon despite all these MMO-lites being around, people complain about the grind but when a new grind pops up they complain and they will still do it either ways.
---
I want to be relevant in fractals =/
---
Seriously tho, I really don't know what they want chrono to be. Should I really change to dps or change to another weapon of what?
---
All MMO playerbases are growing right now due to the state of WoW. FFXIV has seen an unheard of spike in their playerbase, to the point where until yesterday, most of their servers on NA were closed to character creation. I would have been very surprised if GW2's playerbase kept dropping through this. 
---
The problem with GW2 is that despite the amazing qualities that it has, it fails to capitalize on it in any meaningful way. Raid and fractal releases are way too slow, WvW is completely neglected, PvP was (is?) an unbalanced mess for a really really long time. Even just PvE class balance has always been all over the place. 
---
This game is great until you start to specialize or focus on one type of content. At that point the game simply doesn't have enough to offer for anybody that wants to play more than once a week.
---
&gt; beating up on some pianists and holograms
---
I really hope you meant piñatas
---
In general though, there's a few more festivals that happen every year. They're largely meant to provide the same things, some skins, some new activities, some achievement points, etc, just as a break from the regular game. The next one coming up is probably festival of the four winds, sometime within the next month
---
yep we came a long way and no one died this time!
---
Interestingly enough, my smallish guild of 20-30 players blazed through all the dungeons, and farmed them heavily (along with doing everything in the game) burned themselves out in the first 2 years. I survived to year 3. I only do daily login to get the rewards and ensure I get story content in case I return. I don't have the time to put into it these days like before.
---
Those guys, not a single one ever returned, not one time. A relative in the guild still goes back and plays it often but he likes to do the meta thing and work on I-will-crush-you builds (and he is quite effective at it). 
---
I never fully could pinpoint what made me get so bored in GW2, I loved one and actually have more hours into 1 than I do in 2.
---
What would make me wanna recommend GW2 again? Confidence in the game's future. Knowing that an expansion is coming eventually. More focus on veteran/hardcore players, instanced content, PvP, WvW.
---
As a stretch goal, return of LS1, SAB W3-4, removal of the gem price on LS2-3-4: they should come bundled with core, HoT and PoF respectively, so that new players aren't immediately turned away because they just paid $50 for an incomplete story. Was already discussed on this sub last week.
---
As an extra stretch goal: more character appearance options, i.e. new faces, hairstyles, emotes. It's been forever. For Fashion Wars 2, the amount of updates on that is criminally low.
---
Thanks 😊
---
It actually already is half way like that. Notice the mobs in those groups of forged. There are the long ranged snipers. The melee and the mages. As a full glass weaver i do struggle *sometimes* because of the snipers. And if the mage procs it’s 4 wall shield it can lead me to death because short stun and sniper crits me. But usually it boils down to raptor skill one fire/air skill 3-&gt; fire/fire skill 3 and 5 (FA s/d). The mob types and the grouping IS there. It’s just tuned down to a point it’s meaningless. 
---
What could be done, just another idea, keep it the way it is for the usual “play style”. Hardcore content could be that every open world map has a hard mode. (fliped around the idea that raids needs an easy mode essentially). Introduce new weapon and armor augmentations which could be tied to my other idea of masteries. For example some augments provide better exp/karma/MF. However that’s obviously not good enough so PERSONALLY I’d like a new set of armours above ascended however that is extremely unlikely. More realistic would be open world legendary armor. Also, there are a lot, a metric buttload of old gemstore skins that rarely show up in the store because they’re so outdated nobody wants and buys them anyway, anet knows this. These hardcore open world maps could also have a rare (but not ridiculously rare because cmon) chance to drop those gemstore skins. Like the black/gold/white wings. 
---
Those hardcore versions of maps would resemble gw1 quite a lot I imagine. The mages would actually provide protection/stability/regen to melee while might/fury to sniper. Bumped up numbers too. Of course it would require to be different to regular version of the map in terms of objectives. 
---
The possibilities are indeed endless. Everything requires dev time though and let’s hope whatever anet decided to make, it is up to them and their creativity, that it’s fun and enjoyable.
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Personal\_story\_mission\_complete.png](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Personal_story_mission_complete.png) not sure if there's a bigger, better version out there but hope this helps
---
F5 is the elite toolbelt skill for engi. It includes things like:
---
* Moa (Toss Elixir X)
---
* Detection Pulse  (Sneak Gyro Elite)
---
* Orbital Strike (Mortar Kit)
---
* Med Pack (Supply Crate)
---
All of these skills can be game changers in the right scenario. Losing access to them is a big tradeoff, regardless if you want to acknowledge it or not.
---
But they're not creating content faster than *I* can consume it! Don't you see how important my wants are to the long term future of the game?
---
This link. Just add Guild Wars 2 to your steam library and you can play it through the app. Word of advice, make sure you have the streaming PC hardwired. I found over wifi for both devices it's almost unplayable.
---
I have 2 steam links before they went away from them to the app. All hardwired the delay is almost non existent, but still there.
---
&gt;raids, dungeons, PvP, and WvW who are unhappy
---
That's the thing, eh? If those all disappeared tomorrow I wouldn't notice or care. 
---
But I feel sympathy. If S5 was "We're locking everything behind a 10 man dungeon" I'd be salty as fuck too. Map metas give me all the hero team-up I care for. 
---
If anything they need to do a huge QoL and balance pass for everything in the game.
---
I'm 90% out the door as it is, if they handle templates badly I'm 100% out the door and no amount of content release will bring me back. Once I lose faith in a studio / publisher I completely black them out, looking at you EA, you fuckers!
---
I'm torn between Weaver and Thief. Weaver has a lot of flash and has a lot of power locked behind its complicated rotations. The more you invest your skill into it the more it pays off. That said, I do enjoy the ease of Thief's rotations and how varied its playstyle can be dependent on weapon and elite spec. A Daredevil plays entirely different compared to a Deadeye and being able to swap between them on the fly is a nice feeling that keeps it fresh. I also enjoy Warrior but I hope it gets a weapon rework soon to clean up how messy its become in the past 7 years.
---
do i need to complete the whole fractal for the reward? or can i go into the fractal solo and then leave  after the jp
---
No.
---
SA is pretty shit tier right now.
---
ANet needs to address the traits or at least adjust the values.
---
Support thief is nothing but a meme; and will forever be a meme - cause I have no faith in future thief elite specs. Last 2 thief specs were memes, and so will be the 3rd.
---
They are not going to fix this anytime soon. Necro Well of Power got updated twice by the balance team, but is still using Well of Blood icon since October2017. Yes, they will definitely take 3 years or more to get thief portal an icon or to get Well of Power the correct icon.
---
Let’s don’t judge anything on Jaw, he is to melodramatic. I’m sure he will be back playing GW2 since FFXIV has a poor pvp scene.
---
I really do feel sorry for holo after seeing new benchmarks.  That's rough.
---
So something that is relatively an odd topic I feel no one*quite* addresses is that the lack of social media Guild Wars has.One guy hit on it by saying this subreddit is mostly veterans, to which I can't totally attest to (I've been playing intermittently since launch).
---
I'll try to explain the best I can: 
---
Guild Wars' mentality of keeping players from hating each other has ironically made something annoying for me due to the fact I constantly have to Google EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF THE GAME. While it's really cool to feel like I'm playing a game from back in the day where we bought strategy guides and cheat codes, its annoying to the degree where they have MMO aspects without giving you enough information in game to understand exactly what the F is going on or what you need to do. I don't know what boss drops what, I still dont know what fractals are or what agony is (I'm still running through the original campaigns which is so much fun compared to other MMOs that won't be named).
---
All ranting aside, when I try to look up YouTube videos (I still masochistically love that aspect i mentioned btw) the videos have like maybe 2,000 views or some even have under 1,000. On the internet, the game feels dead. But when you log in, the game is so full of people who are actively involved in the game. And I mean REALLY involved. When I play a game I want to enjoy the gameplay and the story, and be around people who enjoy it all the same.
---
The community in game is constantly theory crafting or discussing the world and actively helping other players. The guilds are friendly people (from what I've observed) who are of the same mind like me.
---
If I log in to The Game That Must Not Be Named, its nearly impossible to find other players who enjoy not only the numbers aspect but also the universe itself. If I got into an RP server it's mostly littered with people who change the games story or pretend to be elves with a fetish for orcs. 
---
It was such a breath of fresh air when I posted into general chat saying "This game is so much deeper than what I thought" and hearing the community agreeing with me and talking about how much more I have to discover.
---
In the Nameless Game I basically had to coordinate with a group nonstop to get some of the best and most exclusive items in the game. As a what I deem, a hardcore casual (i like to play solo but I also really comprehend the game without investing time into ratings or speed runs etc) it's almost impossible for me to really see what most MMOs have to offer outside of the initial "early-end game" like Mythic Dungeons or low level arenas. In Guild Wars I joined into my first ever dungeon (the one with the Nightmare group, I cant remember the name exactly I was super stoned and on my lower level Thief I was trying to turn into a Special Ops sniper) and the group didnt nag me whatsoever. I think I did ok because I knew that even my pure DPS build I was using in the open world was getting shrek'd in some content.
---
I had to actively help the group because I wasnt tied to playing a healer class or tank class. I opted for a stealth build that healed and removed conditions from allies but also went Keaneu Reaves on enemies when I could.
---
Sure the game might seem dead from an outside perspective that most Twitch people (the ones that are unfortunately ruining the game community, even though they may have the most benevolent intentions) see, but if players log on and dive deep into the game they'll understand that the game is far, far from dead.
---
One thing that irks me to the very core is the blocking off of older content to players. I'm still not sure if I have access to older rewards in the game even though I logged in at every expansion launch and paid for them. The time gating that games are introducing is making me sick. FOMO is a terrible business practice that needs to be snuffed out in some way that still makes the game money. Q
---
It's a great game, but there's a lot of room for improvement. 
---
Better, more open and honest communication with the users.
---
A return to the 'living world' - making the existing zones something to come back to, not something that turns into ghost towns as people chase the latest new zone/content.
---
Player housing. Even if it's in an instance, real, actual, proper player housing, that players can fully decorate, and show off. 
---
Guild halls that feel like more than just a chunk of map that didn't quite make the cut. A vastly increase increased decoration limit, and the cost of decorations slashed.
---
**Confidence that NCSoft won't do to them what they did to City of Heroes.**
---
Some serious revamping of the engine, to support modern hardware, and incorporate lessons learned.
---
&gt;But of course we do need to value veteran's opinions.
---
Warframe community could use such insight, bravo
---
You're right.
---
Raid scene is dead.
---
PvP is bot city.
---
WvW only has few servers and guild actually active.
---
Save for fractals (which we didn't get any hardcore content into for ages now) every other aspect for players who players who are willing to go hardcore into the game aren't doing well. What is left in the game is for casuals and whales, and many of these whales just refuse to quit because of the sunken cost fallacy.
---
While ANet never truly promised anything the addition of raids in HoT and the cadence of release during that year, including the CM fractals which are raids-lite gave many players hopes that didn't hold up after PoF dropped. It doesn't help that PoF is almost two yers, release intervals between story episodes are longer than they were before and some of them only have the story and the new map, no expansion in sight. It's totally understandable that people who are invested in the game are freaking out, specially when the competition is either around the same age or older and is still doing well in all these aspects.
---
Alliances.
---
Thank you, happy to hear it
---
Perfect !
---
Now Scrapper who's supposed to be tanky support with Gyro can't be bunker or support. This change is just nerf. It's actually 'Purity of Purpose 2019 version'.
---
Great, i prefer to use my weaver in PVE anyway
---
I am gold 3- plat 1 depending on seasons
---
Bad and unrealistic - thank god.
---
Unpopular opinion: Chrono is better now than before.
---
Yes it's true you need clones, so you can't CS shatter for extra DPS. Yes it's true you can't spam F4 for Distortion on Slothasor. Yes it's true that since clone counter empties immediately upon shatter you can't do some of the tricks you could before.
---
However, I feel the positives far outweigh the negatives. For one, you don't need to stand next to a foe to get the full damage of your shatter. Secondly, Chronomancer now has a very viable Condi damage build. Third, you can still boon just as well as before. Fourth, self-alacrity has been BUFFED (which is important since you have less alacrity duration than allies.) 
---
Overall, I'm happy with the changes. Aside from removing distort, they just made Chronomancer easier to play. 
---
Change my mind.
---
What makes it complicated is shuffling loot around various characters, and the need to have a character of the appropriate level to equip that armor on that faction.
---
Equipping it is easy. It's putting yourself in a position where you can do that which is tricky. I haven't religiously levelled alts.
---
I like this game.
---
I hope they fix mesmer in the next expansion.
---
Taking this seriously, no not a chance. Other classes can do way better.
---
Tell that to Kodashs state of wvw.
---
I cam back to the game about a month ago after not playing for 5 years, I was the same, came back and was massively overwhelmed, decided to grab s3&amp;4 unlocked the raptor and then went back to Hot and played the story, learning about masteries and the likes from that, also helps I found a very supportive, active guild, I now have a regular group I pvp &amp; fractal with.
---
Pvp: there are definitely some hard builds to kill but over all its pretty damn fun, wvwvw isn't too bad but mounts feel like it's ruined it a bit compared to how I remember it being.
---
Fractals are still great fun, yet to try raiding.
---
After the first couple days of 'what the fuck am I doing' I'm now really enjoying it.
---
What staff is that :O
---
I like the look :)
---
Pretty sure GW2 has the best underwater combat compared to other MMOs. It even beats the land combat of some.
---
And I wouldnt mind a reason to use my Kraitkin and Kamao'hali more. They are collecting dust until the next underwater fractal daily comes up.
---
Not sure if OP is in denial or bargaining stage.
---
I also have a Chrono, but I like my Mirage much better.   It is a good idea to try Mirage, have fun :)
---
&gt;Core virtues are instant, DH virtues aren't.  
---
You know what else isn't instant? Exiting forge mode to make use of the core engineer skills: kits. Entering forge places a cooldown on all kit utilities. If that's not a good enough trade off then neither is cast times on DH skills. DH utilities not only benefit from passives, but their actives do more than base guardians. They are upgrade not side grade.
---
For new players yes its amazing, for veterans sorry but after so many years iam tired of chasing only cosmetic stuff and doing story content (which is awesome tbh) for a couple of days every 3 months. Plus the grind to unlock something has been getting worse and worse. I used to only play GW2 for many years but now i rather log in Monster Hunter or anything else realy.
---
Sometimes they dont trigger at all even when red (ready to activate).
---
Find the post on the forums about it and comment
---
can someone say if it possible to see same thing for swtor someday?
---
8 man thief party spamming shadowshot with zealot gear or stealthing themselves with SR before they go into dow state to pop up like a daisy
---
&gt;DH.... top of meta.... where? They are only popular in fractals due to excellent cleave. In raids they are middle of the pack almost never a class of choice.  
---
All I can say is if you believe this you ain't raiding with the right people. DH is insanely bursty, which makes it excel at fights where power is preferred.  
---
&gt;DH's tradeoff comes in trait lines.  
---
Umm, this is every single fucking class. Literally. Engineer would love to run Tools alongside Firearms and Explosives too. And don't speak to an engie about utilities that blow, ever heard of gadgets? Or turrets? You're grasping at straws mate.
---
Scrapper really wasn't that good. It's just that it could shut down what a lot of the burst damage meta classes were doing so it took people a while to adjust. The different between the first week after patch and the last week were very different experiences.
---
I don’t get why you’re being downvoted. It’s basically that. You’re paying for entertainment, and while it racks up over time for sure, so does any other form of entertainment with some rare exceptions. If you can’t afford it, then you don’t have to play/pay - but for many people spending 12-15 a month on something they enjoy doing, even if it’s only a few hours a month sometimes, is absolutely okay.
---
Maybe just a small joke left for people who like to do some map break?
---
But that's only for gem skins, a small portion of skins. We still need to get achievement point skins, story skins, racial skins, karma skins, fractal skins, raid skins, pvp skins, and wvw skins... :D
---
I worked in a company that went through lay offs. Different industry, but its irrelevant. The procedure was exactly the same - telling customers and employees nothing will change, we focus on reorganizing etc. They even started hiring month later. And 8 months after spreading false positivity the company shut down.
---
With that experience in mind and seeing Anet realises exactly the same scenario, I dont think anyone should claim "we surviced" so shortly after lay offs.
---
For DH you don't really have to change anything. Rota stays mostly the same except you are punished a bit less if you don't line up F1 + Trap + Symbol as long as you do F1 + Trap and F1+ Symbol at some point so it's nice.
---
&gt;There was absolutely nothing hype about Season 1 in the slightest. It was shoddy, disjointed, rushed and excruciatingly boring.
---
Hey man, there were good stuff there too.
---
Sure, pressing F to fix signs along a road is boring. But Season 1 had really cool things.
---
The dungeons (molten alliance weapons facility, toxic tower, and aetherblade hideout) were quite cool, I specially like the end of the molten alliance one, where you have to run away while the whole thing collapsed. Some fragments of those are (in one way or the other) fractals now.
---
Some world bosses were quite fun. I loved the Giant Marionette and the final battle in the breachmaker with the 3 holograms with different mechanics each. Those things were all prototypes to what we have now in open world (different lanes to a boss, with each going in to fight and others defending) and raids (the 3 aspects of the vale guardian have similar mechanics to the 3 holograms IIRC).
---
And the battle for Lions Arch was damn cool. Both the ones where we need to get the refugees out and the ones where we go back in to retake it.
---
The issue is that this content was on old maps, where people needed to go to their personal stories and it made new players really confuse. So they decided to move away from the style of content that changes current maps and create new maps "frozen in time". Where the story will be stuck forever in that moment.
---
I have thought of that and how cool it could be but sadly the
---
"We don't want to split the game's playerbase" response whenever addressing stuff like an easy mode for taxes or time lapses for open world etc
---
You should rename your druid Oprah Healfrey, and set up a macro that whispers to every Target you heal with "And you get a heal!!"
---
The game is not doing fine compared to other MMORPGs like FF and ESO - they are far ahead now and GW should be there too but the game has no direction atm and feels like its just a matter of time when it starts going downwards.
---
ahahahaahahahaha...
---
I am laughing now, but if I met you in that race, you would be not laughing (^.^)
---
What I don't understand, considering how healthy is the game, is their choice of not releasing a new xpac. Like, isn't thay their main source of income? Not only directly, but it also helps bringing back old players and even new ones, players that might be willing to spend on the cash shop if they find the game appealing. The game might be doing fine, but it's been 2 years since the last xpac and probably will be 2y or even more until next. It's absurd for an mmo, a healthy and populated one
---
What ? How's that ? Having exotic underwater weapons at the least is totally normal, it's not like they're hard to get
---
Yeah it is subjective as an experience, but not as polish.
---
It is far more polished than any MMO's combat in the engine/mechanics and impact factor. BDO is said to come close or edge over it in some factors but it is pay2win in PvP so it has its own pitfalls.
---
I have played ESO and talked to people who have played both.
---
The only people who think ESO combat is better are the people who haven't played GW2. It is objectively more clunky and minimally responsive. Yes the skill flavour is subjective, but the overall systems are worse. Generally though, most people I have met who play ESO don't actually think the combat is that great. They love the other MMO systems and immersion (Why it has one of the largest roleplaying communities I imagine), which I definitely can see ESO is very strong on.
---
I personally like having most except the huge metas soloable, it is an MMO so cooperation should be encouraged, however making it neccessary to do a large amount of the open world content means people may be gating behind "well shit theres nobody doing this atm". When playing open world, it's really nice to be able to just... play. Not constantly worry about "am I intended to be able to do this or am I gonna have to look for people".
---
I do agree that the metas in PoF weren't great (both reward wise and design wise), though.
---
A kind of design I liked was the rifts in Jahai. If you're a large group, the event scales up to fit. However, if you are alone, you CAN solo it, at a level more fit for that.
---
I still use them to make mystic kits even though i have silver-fed as the cost per use is cheaper (10c vs 60c)
---
You have just described what I do lmao, Lava Font takes the cake on rallying me up
---
I'm not sure you truly get the casual mindset. 
---
Sure the actual raids take little time doing once you start doing them. But it's the starting part that takes time and effort. Actually learning mechanics, building a network of trusted people and/or finding a good guild, being there at the scheduled time etc etc. You know, the actual git gud part.
---
And if you're a person who can't play mmos for more than an hour everyday gitting gud is truly not worth the effort at the end of the day. Even if the raids are mindblowingly good.
---
Wether an mmo is alive depends on 2 factors, not 1. New players coming in and players staying around. Anet is currently struggling a bit with keeping them.
---
&gt; If I had to guess
---
If I had to guess the cancellation of a bunch of side projects including terminating their ongoing dev cost could explain *quite* the uptick in revenue :P
---
Yeah but as you just admit, you like the mechanics. That is what he means I imagine, and what I was referencing.
---
The balance has been a shit show since HoT, but that is partially because they neglect the combat. They don't see it as the gift to their game it is and squander it focusing on lackluster story content.
---
Rather if combat was their main focus, especially in competitive game modes, the balance would be better perhaps, but definitely more frequent.
---
Why is it fine for legendaries but not infusions ? Cost ? Difficulty to get ?
---
Stacking infusions is more costly and more time consuming to achieve than any legendary. ( except cheap ghostly infusions )
---
I highly doubt this is the casr anymore. Most people will either still point to WoW or to FFXIV
---
As a berserker main, I just have to find a group to run with now...  
---
Trying to solo roam / 1v10 isn't working as a zerker :X
---
I meant the content specifically. The story itself is really bad imo, but the content (gameplay itself) isn't bad, it's fun but not replayable.
---
It should have never been their main focus though, imo.
---
Yes , some do. That is literally one reason a lot of people made The Dreamer. To annoy others with the neigh sound.
---
&gt;And 97% of the dev resources go into this. Why. 
---
I'm no expert but this is probably because that is what vast majority of players will ever see. I've been playing Guild Wars since like 2006, even though I don't preorder stuff I went and pre-ordered GW2 and all the expansions. And yet, only since about a month ago I started doing T1 Fractals, I don't know if I will ever do raids even.  Doing more than open world is just a time investment, and honestly when you're an adult, with day job and kids, you don't have a whole lot of it to invest and multiple games to play. For the longest time I played mostly Story stuff, and some map completion, and I appreciate how cool are all the maps with little details here and there. You can explore at your own pace, not bound to other people like in fractals. I rarely see stuff at the end of Fractals, since people usually just want to finish ASAP and go to the next island, even though I'd love to get some lore for them. In open world I can easily hang out after the end of even chain to see interactions between NPCs.  
---
I get that you want other stuff to do, and I wish there was more content for you. Anet is again not giving us any info about direction it's taking the game, but with the recent layoffs and moving people back to work on GW2, there's a sliver of hope we'll see more stuff to do for all kinds of players.
---
I'd finally got my shit together enough to start playing and learning and even enjoying a decent Chrono build. Literally after years of feeling 'meh' about that elite spec, I was starting to 'get it'. My thinking was that it had been nerfed and changed so much recently that surely there was not so much risk to it.
---
Ah, I was wrong. Arrogant, innocent and full of hope. No more.
---
\^(But hey Elementalist and Thief are looking pretty nice I guess!)
---
Comparing FFXIV to GW2 is... not really in the same ball park.
---
FFXIV had a major flop and because FF is such a major IP there was the risk that any future MMO they made would flop as well. They decided to rebuild it instead of abandoning it while simultaneously continuing development of their single player titles. FFXIV is also a subscription-based game which means there is a constant revenue stream so long as people maintain their subscriptions.
---
Squeenix is a massive powerhouse in the industry. Anet is... slightly above average, if even that much. Where SE pushes to always have cutting edge, Anet always cut resources to reduce overhead and very rarely pushed for modern tech. Anet is also under the thumb of NCSoft and has a financial duty to them.
---
So not only are the revenue streams for the two games different, the business structure and environment is different as well. They both came out as GAS (Games As a Service) models started coming out. There had been online multiplayer games before which were box priced and free online services, but GW2 was among the few to really cost nothing extra to play after purchasing with large scale multiplayer.
---
Anet isn't generating the money and even if they were they wouldn't have the same freedom as SE to focus on GW2 to improve. And given what we learned earlier this year, it seems highly probable that Anet was just going to coast GW2 for a while as they worked on new IPs/games to branch out as a company. Putting and keeping all eggs in the same basket can be ridiculously risky in online services and video games in general.
---
Being pessimistic is understandable. I don't have high expectations of the game's future either, though I don't really imagine it imploding any time soon either. I expect it to more or less just continue the same path with slight ups and slight downs with an overall slow arc of improvement or adding novel features.
---
You're not wrong that it's up to Anet to show that they care and that there's a sparkling future... though I think you're kind of wrong to expect that they would do that. It's not really their thing.
---
That's because it isn't at that level. I imagine for a lot of people outside the community GW2 is on the same sort of level as Tera, Aion and possibly even Wild Start at this point in time. 
---
The game has such massive distances between content drop, zero marketing, zero presence on Twitch and has little to no hardcore content. As much as people shit on hardcore content it is that very content that builds a game and builds a strong community/scene. Just look at WoWs race to world 1st for the new raid currently going on as an example and all the FFXIV hardcore content as another.
---
As a PvP main, I base a lot of my opinions on that. I have 14k hours so naturally, I have spend time in other modes too, my least being WvW. In PvP, the combat mechanics are stellar, and honestly? The mechanics themselves are stellar across the board 
---
Your issue, as with many of us, is a mixture of focus and balance. The combat isn't utilised properly in most PvE content I agree, but that isn't to do with the combat mechanics or the engine (which as the arguably the best, and definitely one of the best in MMOs), it is to do with ANET's approach to PvEcl content, and the neglect of PvP/WvW rather than the combat systems themselves.
---
Definitely ranger, though I've been a druid specifically since HoT came out.   
---
People make fun of "bearbows", but it really is perfect if you're going for the high fantasy feeling of a DnD ranger, and I haven't swapped out my longbow since 2013, it just feels great to fire. Everyone cries about rangers using longbow 4 until they suddenly have a CC bar they can't break on their own.
---
I've also very recently discovered the Serpent's Ire meta, no idea why I never tried it until a couple months ago. It feels good to throw on all my healing gear that typically only gets used in fractals and be able to keep the zerg alive out in the brandstorm while they kill branded forgotten. Same back when season 3 maps were heavily populated, I'd come cross watchknight events close to failing in Lake Doric, but being able to actually HEAL the watchknights back up long enough for the event to succeed just feels extra rewarding for some reason.
---
Also the pet variety. Using iboga pull to drag fleeing players back in in PVP feels great. Usually the player I pulled back in proceeds to murder me because I suck lol, but boy did I inconvenience them for a few seconds!
---
This gonna be such a big game changer for me. Fuck snow crows, im gonna homebrew EVERYTHING!
---
Nah, pinky swear. It was the case like 2 weeks ago when I was looking for an MMO and settled with FFXIV. 
---
GW2 is a rite of passage. Anyone trying to get into MMOs is going to be sent to GW2 first, and then they'll move onto the MMOs that get updates.
---
I believe we will get the build templates and the legendary sigils/runes in the same patch.
---
I wouldn't say it's the combat personally. Sure it looks flashy and it feels smoother to play but it is by no means as in depth as something like FFXIV or what WoW combat was a few exapnsions ago (bfa combat is shit). 
---
Everything is basically stack in a melee death ball and spam your rotation with little to no thought.
---
You're right. But that's LITERALLY the job of the community manager , and I don't even know who the fuck has that position. I've never seen them on here.
---
You are deluding yourself if you think GW2 is tied for 2nd place with ESO and FFXIV. Currently FFXIV is tied with WoW for 1st place and depending on the next WoW content patches/expansion could dethrone it. I would then put ESO as 2nd and GW2 is really 3rd and trailing from the rest of the pack.
---
I tried it but gave up on the configuration of the controller, I somehow just could not do what I wanted, very frustrating. But it should actually work.
---
The most enjoyable class to play is **Multiclass**
---
Which is a blessing. The few times I have to deal with pugs that are heavily into Twitch culture there will inevitably be either unintelligible phrases that rile people up or outright toxicity. It is quite nice to have a game that isn't so invested in appeasing that sub section of those that play videogames.
---
Twitch feels like an avenue for all those younger siblings that always wanted to come and sit and watch you play videogames (even things as deathly boring to watch as menu based RPGs) and then make silly jokes about what happens. I'm sure it has an audience, but as the older sibling it isn't me and I'm not too keen on games where the culture is prevalent.
---
Stuff like this is why I’m glad I went with a Mirage, but being fairly new I had the benefit of seeing a whole history of fundamental adjustments to the spec before I could even think about trying to get too invested in it.
---
progression is something gw2 really needs to improve upon, the mastery system is alright because it still has a lot of things that are pretty useless; and the gearing system which while many love because it's horizontal progression instead of vertical I would say is making the game fairly boring because it doesn't give you any incentive once you have it
---
Yes the best content GW2 has to offer is to Zerg around pressing 1. Such riveting gameplay how could other MMOs even think of competing.
---
chronom--
---
just kidding.
---
This is what I mean... Just sensationalist stuff to try and push an opinion.
---
I'm not sure when you thought the raid scene was booming, but it seems to be pretty much around the same population as ever. Groups tend to become insular when they get enough people who work well together, so they're not posting in LFG or recruiting on forums and such. I pug raided (NA) for a year and slowly found myself being invited to regular groups to the point we just started up a static. Your mileage will vary.
---
I've seen people post complaints about bots in sPvP and I've even encountered a couple in unranked. In ranked I've run into more than a couple of win traders, too. Out of hundreds of matches, I've seen maybe half a dozen of each. I've seen waaaaaaaaaay more people raging and claiming other people were botting or win trading because they argued in chat or thought they were bad players. Your mileage will vary.
---
WvW is... Honestly harder to comment on because I've been on BG ever since I started playing. There are peak times and there are dead times. Just like how I'm more likely to find a Fractal CM group around reset than I am at Reset+7, I'm more likely to see large scale WvW action around Reset+1 than I am at Reset +20. Small scale stuff I can always expect to run into another solo player or small group flipping camps or farming pips, though. Your mileage will vary.
---
My question to you is: What are you using to set your expectations? The peaks from when new content is released where populations spike? Rose-tinted glasses to look back at when you were new to a certain game mode? Your perspective might be a bit twisted from burnout. The reality may be more along the lines that things were never really all that glamorous to begin with.
---
Another question: Who do you consider to be competition? 
---
When I think about that, my mind goes to games like Secret World and WildStar. Subscription-based games, especially by companies with established intellectual properties (Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, Final Fantasy), doesn't really pan out in terms of scope, capability, or expectations imo.
---
I play all of the game modes, and I can say that PvE isnt fine either. Sure if you plsy 2hours a day, you will be fine with open world conent, but endgame is lacking hard. One raid with 3 bosses/year and no fractal Challenge Modes. Games are supposed to challenge you, not spoonfeed you rewards for existing.
---
Jaws is just a money hungry megalomaniac opportunist. GW2 served its purpose for him so now he goes to leech another community.
---
TBH I don't know the names of those skills yet (not at home to check ingame). But you can have a look at the animations on this other post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ce51uj/first\_thing\_i\_did\_use\_all\_new\_animation\_at\_once/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ce51uj/first_thing_i_did_use_all_new_animation_at_once/)
---
The thing is, it isn't single player content. Streamers like Teapot can use this short hand all they wish but it is incorrect. What they mean is actually "it is multiplayer content that I don't enjoy".
---
The Dragonfall meta would fail if someone truly tried the content as a single player. Same with other small events like many champ fights or the branded Djinn in Jahai Bluffs.
---
Teapot wants raids but, while Guild Wars 2 has some of those (that have been getting better with time too), it was never a main focus of the game so it is something of a folly to hope that that will ever be supported as much as raids in raid-focused games such as WoW.
---
And then of course there is the irony of Teapot stating that he'll be checking out Classical WoW instead, showing that he never played WoW through vanilla or TBC. It is incredibly a single player experience at times. I guess he can have fun grinding out raid mats solo and then giving up when another player turns up.
---
waves of layoffs and spineless firings of outspoken staff because they're afraid of losing even a small part of their community don't paint a great picture of sustainability.  "profitable" companies dissolve all the time.
---
I think you grossly under estimate FF14 twitch reach compared to GW2. In the last year FF14 has had 134k viewers compared to the 27k of GW2, that is really not even on the same level. 
---
Like I said in my post Twitch is "one of the most powerful tools" that doesn't mean its the only thing that will bring in new players, but it is a fairly good representation of having a healthy dedicated player base. 
---
For sure there are big streamers and people trying to make it big that jump from game to game looking for the next big hit but there are a lot of twitch streamers which are mono gamers and will stream their "main" game as it were. These are the people GW2 is sorely lacking because there just isn't any content worth sticking around for after all these years. 
---
An online game having a poor twitch presence is a symptom of having a weak and dying community which is a symptom of the game also dying and no one wants to invest money in a game in maintenance mode or lacks direction.
---
As much as the gw2 player base loves to bash hardcore content it is this very content which builds and develops communities which is a corner stone of a healthy MMO.
---
Agreed. People meme about teapot after watching him for 5 minutes and get the impression that teapot is negative about the game but in reality, if I've ever seen anyone care about guild wars 2, it's teapot. That dude loves this game so much that it actually hurts him to see that the anet abandoned all players except the casuals. 
---
Anet abandoned competitive pvp and made the newer raids like the US public school system and lowered the standards (for the casuals). They are literally afraid of competition. 
---
OP talks about anet is doing better financially but why the in the world are they taking a million years to release raids and LS? Why did they layoff devs if they are doing so well? They have leterally slowed down production while becoming better financially. WHERE THE FUCK IS THE MONEY GOING TO? 
---
OP is just a giant wall of meme. It's true, the game is not dead, it's just filled with casuals. This game might as well be an offline single player game at this point. There is no player interaction when all of the content is casual. The "MMO" aspect is dead. It's a single player game.
---
They dont need twitch but how many gw2 advertisements have you seen?
---
Those damn pianists! They got what was coming to them! :p
---
&gt;but there are a lot of games kept alive just to make money off of a dying title. No expansion in the foreseeable future is a bad sign for me
---
If they're making money, they're not being kept alive. They *ARE* alive by very definition.
---
&gt;GW2 can't be considered one of the biggest MMOs right now for sure, it's not comparable to WoW, FFXIV and ESO.
---
You could say the same for the entire MMO genre using that definition. Just look at any MMO compared to Fortnite. WoW is Dead, FF14 is Dead, ESO is Dead.
---
Imo, it dies too easily in open world, its not the best idea to play pure dps there because you dont have a healer and supports out there
---
Considering that you already got a few answers yesterday, it's probably the best if you make both and test them in pvp lobby with everything unlocked (or try them out with lv 80 boost trial in pve, but this doesn't include elite specs).
---
Open world pve OMEGALUL
---
&gt;Hey man, there were good stuff there too.
---
There really wasn't. At it's very best, LS1 was mediocre. It's only now that the nostalgia goggles have set in and intensified the stockholm syndrome.
---
Whatever you change or focus at, there is always a group of people that feel unhappy. I still like it that content in this game is made and accessable for everyone (except for the content behind expansions, but just buy them they are awesome). It is pretty easy to get into everything and for every part of the game there is this community to help you to get started.
---
Calm down satan
---
A little bit of gold?
---
Is there any MMO that was honestly drawing people from Twitch? WoW used mostly YouTube, BDO paid streams worked for few moments till money stream ended and people realized how p2w the game is, and so on, so on. Sure, GW2 combat is/was on esports viable level, but is there really any real audience for MMO streams to fight for on twitch?
---
I'd also like a method of acquiring pseudo ones like the WVW/pvp armor sets. Maybe unlock a recipe for a new gift? Possible upgrades for the most trinkets that are available in fractals/pvp /WVW. 
---
It would be nice to swap them out whenever instead of a reset item. I'm sure people will happily work towards an upgrade that costs a lot for that slight covwnience
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defiance_bar
---
This lists everything.
---
I love this.
---
As a vet, Im pretty happy with the game currently, I loved the last episode and Im ecstatic they brought dragonbash back.
---
But tbh I think build templates may actually bring a lot of players back.
---
YOU THINK THEY CARE?!?!?! $50 says they pumped these skills out in a week off the back of some off-hand comment.
---
Why make the game enjoyable when they could make gemstone skins instead?
---
This sadly.
---
It could be a tanky trolly build with portal for the luls but not really a point in it.
---
Maybe it will work well if thief gets an elite spec focused on heals/buffs. (A eastern themed monk spec would be great, but likely have to trade stealth in for barrier etc...)
---
Just to be clear, outside of outright removing the content you enjoy from the game which I think we can agree is unrealistic, the only thing that would stop you from enjoying the game is being forced into unpleasant social interactions? Could Anet stop developing new open world content entirely and keep you as a player?
---
That's what I'm getting at. You aren't worth the dev time because, as far as I can tell, You'd be willing to play what's already here till kingdom come, because 'hanging out' with your friends is enough. 
---
I don't think there's anything wrong with that, but it's not the person people should be developing a videogame for, precisely because that development for someone who will always be content isn't worthwhile compared to development that retains or brings in players that would otherwise not be playing the game. 
---
I don't think I'm trying to make you look bad. All I'm saying with regards to our similarity as players is that me and players like myself aren't in an ivory tower doing nothing but sell raid challenges or whatever. We play the same game everybody else does, and our frustrations with it aren't because we're so out of touch with reality that we expect something we shouldn't. 
---
Plus, you can have a playground that can't be played by bots. There's space for legitimately difficult open world content in this game, the devs are just afraid to implement it. 
---
For what it's worth, beetle races are actually an extremely good example of content that can cater to both hardcore players and casuals. They're probably the single best outcome of mounts being added to the game imo, even if they don't really fit the flow of the rest of the core maps. I wish there was more content like that, that could be completed by hardcore players and casuals alike, and provide just as much fun to both parties. I wish more content, world bosses for instance, were designed that well.
---
Not Eta but in august gw2 has its anniversary, so probably around that time we will have a sale, but nothing is confirmed
---
I think that's due to their now-cancelled side projects / mobile games / whatever. They were probably supposed the new big cash cow, a better one than GW2 expansions, that's why they put them on hold. But with the layoffs happening, that plan didn't work out so well, and now that a new expansions should be due, they don't have one.
---
I still think you are right, expansions are their main source of income again now, and that's why I'm absolutely convinced that they started working on expansion three. But LW S4 is over, that's why they'll try to keep us entertained with a fifth season until the expansion is ready.
---
Oh yeah, WvW players. Laughing at the audacity of players who dared to ask to join a zerg with non-meta build. Telling them to go level and gear another class.    
---
And then wondering why WvW population doesn't grow, lmao.
---
How did you create this image?
---
For a lot of people particularly the younger generations Twitch is 100% a sign of game health and if you don't see that then you are blind my friend. 
---
Gw2 is currently being kept a float by so called whales who are willing to spend 100s if not 1000s on the in game shop and really nothing else. For a lot of the gaming community at large this game might as well be DED for all they hear about it.
---
Yeah thats totally fair but Gw2 wasn't always like that. In the early days Dungeons were supposed to be super difficult hardcore content and pvp tried to host an esport scene. The game modes in question don't even need that much attention to be somewhat good. Only frequent balance would suffice.
---
Has there been sales in the past around that time?
---
Makes sense, it's kinda sad tho to know that they only care about the game as long as it can produce money and they are ready to throw it in the trash if a new project looks more lucrative
---
don't downvote this, its true
---
Uhm... where did you read any of those statements? Surely not in my post
---
Immersion 100
---
I wish the guild decoration would let us switch between different dragon holograms. And if they someday decide to swap out the hologram at the event for a new one then they could add it to the decoration so that we get more dragons that we can choose from. This way ppl could get a hologram of the dragon they like the most.
---
It's not about the graphics but how poorly it runs on most machines and isn't optimized at all for new hardware. You can get triple digit FPS in those other games while struggling to stay above 30 in some GW2 areas.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
It's a shame the wiki didn't have the drop rate though
---
So i'm really not sure where this comes from. But even the raiding scene is very casual in gw2, you don't need to be a hardcore player to be raiding (but i guess that depends on your definition of hardcore player). I don't even know where you want to put those 8h per evening into. There are not that many raids. A fullclear takes like 3-5h (with a static ofc, pugs are a different animal) once a week if you do it all on one day. You can adjust that based on how much time you have, you don't need to fullclear every week to be a raider.
---
In the trainings guild i'm in ([RTI on EU](https://rti.enjin.com/)) our training runs are schedueled for 3h, we clear anywhere between 0-7 bosses in those normaly (highly depending on which boss and how many people are completely new). There is no requirement on how many trainings you have to take part in, so you can do it whenever you have time.
---
So no, you definitely do not have to be a hardcore player, nor putting in 8h/day to raid in gw2, you can raid very casually if you're willing to put any effort in.
---
I agree on the WvW players being coocoo though, they are just weird sometimes.
---
I can try that, i need to make a thief though!
---
There are rare weapon skins to grind for in S4 map. For rare armor skin I recommend playing PvP
---
They can work on another expansion, which will make them more money from *both* whales and casuals. Tie good cosmetic rewards to the expansion, as you need to pay the hard cash gate to even attempt to get them in the first place. 
---
&gt; work output has remained relatively constant
---
Are you kidding me? LW4 took 1.5 years to finish compared to LW3's 1 year with far more reused assets and shortcuts taken in LW4 compared to LW3. In addition, they did not lose 1/3 of their GW2 workforce, as most of the employees fired were on side projects (yes, even Josh Foreman. Why weren't there any JPs in LW4 then?). Where are WvW alliances? Why is there only 1 raid a year? What's with the shitty, untested LW4 fractals with no challenge modes?
---
I understand that you want Anet to succeed, but I'm sure NCSOFT wants them to do that as well. You need to understand that NCSOFT isn't just an evil organisation hell-bent on killing MMOs, they are a company and they need profit. And Anet's horrendous management is showing that they need to be punished in order to learn.
---
Tell me what did you hear about FF14 in the last 2 years, hell, 4 years, if we exclude the huge marketing push of the last few months tied to the latest expansion?
---
Did you see people on Twitch running the mutliple new raids and dungeons released between expansions? Did you see people streaming the new story content that has been continuously released every 3 months for the past several years?
---
Are you telling me that people considered FF14 to be DED before Shadowbringers because it had (and continues to have) no presence on Twitch?
---
This is not entirely true, people don't play PvP/WvW or challenging PvE content like CM raids and fractals because of their gold to effort ratio. Rather many of the more "dead" game modes are held up by the small number of veterans who keep trucking on even after the player base has largely left it alone.
---
If veterans wanted to just amass gold they would probably look to more lucrative and exclusive methods of money making that aren't grunt work, like gifts/legendary selling and TP flipping.
---
a player mastering his rotation in full zerk exo (total 15g) will deal wayyyyy more than your average full ascended pug dps.
---
More over, if they focus on the weapons, they can reach 95% of the normal ascended DPS (which amount to 25k+ DPS, which is something I rarely see in Raids, and I include myself in the "not 25k+" category)
---
Okay thank you!
---
I just want build templates so badly
---
You might want to check out some companion tools to the game, for example www.gw2efficiency.com 
---
By supplying it with your API key, the page will be able to read your account and show it for you, filter locked/unlocked skins, order by costs, and so on. It also has wiki link for most items so you can just click on it and get to the wiki where stuff can be got from.
---
That being said, there is a lot of basic skins from crafting through all the tiers, then there is full set of skins (all 3 weights + all weapons) from each dungeon - either play dungeons or do dungeon reward tracks in WvW/PvP. Both WvW and PvP have their own skins, via reward tracks -&gt; then more skins in vendors (ascended). 
---
New maps usually come with few skins, and latest living story maps have whole new upgradable sets. 
---
There is many gemstore skins as well.
---
Have in mind that skins usually aren't really expensive, but dyes are. Also, most rare minis have way higher value than skins as well. (junundu mini, awakened abomination, etc)
---
Not single core cpu locked.
---
He is talking about WoW Classic which releases next month.
---
it's running on a computer, just being streamed to /controlled with the phone
---
Can just read traits tbh.
---
Nah it's not about that. It's a different kind of effect, most legendaries are way less flashy out of combat and their flashiness is combat is usually very well designed. And I'll take glowing footsteps any day over giant wings on everyone and them shining like a beacon.
---
ArenaNet could have EASILY turned GW2 into "THE MMORPG" if they really pushed for that. But time after time they have proven to me that they don't care about this type of thing.
---
The game in the year it was released was actually designed to be very competent in the E-Sports scene. Coming from a game like GW1 which had godlike PvP they were thinking they could push GW2 in this direction and this would have been the endgame (sPvP+WvW). Long story short all of this has either failed or they decided this is simply not the best way to make money. They added Raids to the game in the first expansion, but I don't think they were really thinking of becoming a game focused on this type of endgame content.
---
Basically somewhere along the road they have decided to turn the game into a casual fiesta and build the whole thing around it. So in my eyes GW2 right now is a game for people who are on their 30s who are working while having to deal with kids and have limited time to login to the game. When gemstore updates arrive these are the people who just swipe their creditcard and buy all the stuff cos they can't invest enough time in the game to receive it that way. These people have become the main audience of GW2 and it will be impossible to change this until the game dies. So most of the content will be designed with these people in mind which is why Living Season 5 is gonna turn out to be the absolutely same as LS4 with small changes.
---
So could this game have better Raids/Dungeons than WoW if Anet really pushed for it? Absolutely yes. Better PvP than other MMOs? Again yes. Would they make more money out of the game if they were to push in this direction? In my opinion, again yes. But they have decided against this and went down another route.
---
I'd pay a million bucks to actually learn how much money they make out of different types of players (newcomers, casuals, hardcore pve/pvpers and so on).
---
then why play a mmorpg if all you do is talk to NPCs, not to mention if there's no story in the game you will just have to start doing fracs or raids instead, if you want to read a story you can simply buy a book
---
&gt; The last four quarters of the PoF era have in total been about 12m higher 
---
LOL, the point wasn't that the last 4 quarters were not higher, it was that you cherry picked them and left out that the overall difference between the two periods that YOU compared was less than 3m, to give a false impression.
---
&gt;  If the current trend continues...
---
The trend is the same, it is downhill we are now at 16m rather than 14m, whopee! Which could be entirely down to better monetization of less players.
---
And let's just put it in perspective again that 16m is 25% more than Aion... That is the the steaming juggernaut of "success", Aion...
---
&gt; So far you're the only one who has ever called it "evidence".
---
Okay I'll reword it for you, as an indicator of the state of GW2's playerbase it is laughable and shows an impressive level of desperation.
---
I know games aren't charities, but when a f2p title starts to focus on skins and gambling it's relying on human nature rather than making a good game. There is a big difference between milking every last cent off a playerbase with basically no effort to focusing on actual good content.
---
Referring to criticism with "raging gaming babies" isn't very fair of you. I'm not playing GW2 because it's not worth the time and money anymore. I'm not going to defend it religiously even though I played it for thousands for hours because I can see it's going downhill.
---
I really don't get why people complain about the engine. Yes the game is lacking in optimization but other then very crowded zones, any mid-range PC from 2012 or later will run GW2 just fine. Hell i played on an Intel Ivy Bridge i3-U with IGPU for two years and managed to have a decent enough experience.   
---
Unless i'm missing anything but other then performance lacking a tad, what's wrong with the current engine as it is?
---
dead accounts with hoarded valuable items can still maintain or even gain value in time due to market changes
---
Another useful link for this:
---
http://immortius.net.au/wardrobe-unlock-analyser/
---
Some classes are flat out useless in "Zerg meta" so this is a non-issue.

You dont understand, the engine stop not only performance issues, but it also limit what devs can do in game. It limits what kind of mechanics/balance they can give us. If we wanted more dynamic events/mechanics they need change engine. When stuff like having 2 currencies on inventory window blocked by engine code it shows how terrible situation is...
---
Oh boi, here I come.   
---
First of all, I've been playing since the first beta and logged over 8000h. I've done mapping,  dungeoning,fractals, guild missions, raids, guild halls, pvp, wvw, and anything else that comes to mind, and nowadays I struggle to play for more than two days after each living world episode, unless it has some kind of profitable gold farm (Yes, the only thing that keeps me playing is gold farming).
---
Now that that is out of the way, let me tell you what, in my opinion, could make GW2 the great MMO it was supposed to be.
---
\- Give guild a purpose. Having a guild hall or doing guild missions has literally no purpose at all anymore, unless you want the armor skin or some wvw bonuses, outside of that guilds are absolutely useless. Bring back GvG, guild alliances, bonuses for being in a guild that actually mean something, etc,...
---
\- Zaishen trials, please.
---
\- PvP needs a serious re-work too, as it stands it's a dying game-mode, and not only because after 7 years there's just two game modes to play. It's not only unbalanced, there's really not much point into playing pvp as there's barely any reward to it other than doing it for fun, and the fun goes instantly away as half of your team is always AFK. Pretty sure most PvPers are back in GW1 PvP which, imo, is much more fun and rewarding.
---
\- No need to speak about WvW, we know it's getting a re-work, it's a matter of when and how well they do it. Hopefully the alliance system and server re-works bring fresh life to this "slowly" decaying game-mode. Also, I can't talk much about this game-mode either as I haven't touched it in years, I don't even have the Warclaw. Feel free to argument about it for me.
---
\- Vanilla GW2 needs a re-vamp, the poor ol' thing feels outdated and it barely keeps up with HoT and PoF events and metas, other than because you can glide and use mounts in them, and if it wasn't for the World Boss Rush extra rewards, barely anyone other than new players would be in the old maps. Dungeons also need a fresh coat of paint, heck, I'd give both my kidneys and my liver for some HoT and PoF inspired dungeons. And adding big meta events Tarir, Dragon Stand or Dragonfall style to most maps would give them much more life (Looking at you Gandara) though barely anyone does the meta at Jahai Bluffs (is that the map with the tornado?)
---
\- Some parts of the economy are fucked, but I can't really give much insight in this as I haven't been paying attention to the BLTP for a while. (I'm still looking at you people saying that Multiloot was destroying the economy LOL) Also, how about we give collections for all the legendary weapons? No point in saying you're gonna do something then stopping halfway through it.
---
\- Did I mention Zaishen trials?
---
\- The Sun's Refuge, what was the point of bringing that back if it's useless? What do I want it for other than for the skyscale collection? It has it's own free portal scroll, give the thing life, add to it stuff that I would use in a daily basis, merchants, trading posts, crafting of my choosing, I don't know, give it life!
---
That's about all that comes to my mind right now, let's comment and argumentate about it, as the only way to reach an agreement and improve is by talking.
---
Oh okay, my PC have been dead for 8 months now so I can't play gw2
---
Forge placing a cooldown isn't really a tradeoff. A tradeoff is a loss you get when you use the elite spec over core. Engineer loses the shittty elite toolbelt skills from slotting Holo and gains forge. If core had a forge and Holo had a different or stronger forge that placed cooldown on kits, that would be a tradeoff. Now its just an upgrade with a limitation. Holo utility skills are much better than core as well, and Photon Wall in particular does the same thing as DH f3 but on a much shorter cooldown. Not to mention how Holo in unquestionably better than DH at WvW and PvP.
---
See what I did there? I disregarded the spec limitations with arbitrary reasons much like you did for DH. The limitations do not need to be relevant or clear all the time but they are there.
---
So we can keep discussing which spec has more severe drawbacks. But whats the point? Do you want DH to receive an equally retarded tradeoff as Holo did this patch? 
---
By your standards, almost all of the other classes have an elite spec with superficial or no tradeoffs as well. Soulbeast has 0 tradeoffs, Druid has minimal, Reaper has minimal, Daredevil has one irrelevant for PvE, Ele both specs minimal tradeoff etc. Do you want all classes to receive offhand nerfs, or are you just upset about Holo and want to vent?
---
Reshade i guess
---
Renegade and firebrand are very strong supports atm. Check snowcrows and discretize website for builds and usage.
---
Isthereanydeal dot com
---
Can anyone recommend a build for core Guardian, PvE roaming, in HoT maps? 
---
I don't know guardian very well, but want to get some hero points for the elites, so HoT seemed like a good bet but I'm dying a butt ton and can't kill anything. I'm currently going for lots of aegis and heals but doesn't seem to be working.
---
Yeah this is good as long as you are not focused or 1v1 against a mobile opponent (which is to say, all of them). If you can get the drop on an enemy or a group it's powerful but otherwise can be easily kited.
---
&gt; LOL, the point wasn't that the last 4 quarters were not higher, it was that you cherry picked them
---
If I want to know how the game is doing *right now*, of course I have to look at the *most recent* quarters, that's not really cherry picking.
---
&gt; and left out that the overall difference between the two periods that YOU compared was less than 3m, to give a false impression.
---
Nope, I was not trying to give a false impression, sorry if you feel that way. Point still stands, PoF era made more money than HoT era until now. And I already explained in my last post that the main point is that PoF era earnings are way more stable than HoT era ones.
---
&gt; The trend is the same, it is downhill
---
The game is 7 years old, of course the game won't perform as good in 2019 as it did in 2012. The trend I'm referencing is that the game is doing notably better in 2018/19 than it did in 2016/17, looking at the earnings only. That's a simple fact. The reasons for this are debatable, I know. If the game is doing fine aside from its earnings is debatable too, I get that.
---
&gt; Okay I'll reword it for you, as an indicator of the state of GW2's playerbase it is laughable and shows an impressive level of desperation.
---
Okay. Let's just agree to disagree on that one.
---
Right, but even if you take all traits that reduce those skills' cooldowns, you barely get 50% stealth uptime max, hardly permastealth
---
There are many beetle races  people still do.. this has given me the idea to sit like this one one and afk😂😂
---
Copy this build
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Guardian_-_Radiant_Greatsword
---
Aegis and healing in solo play are really bad
---
I've been wanting a charr tank mount since I first saw them sitting in black citadel, I'd settle for a charr brute chopper. Hopefully with a gun attack for its 1, if it were a distinct mount rather than a skin.
---
so? how do you know others haven't hoarded more before quitting?
---
I know right?!
---
Dunno Metabattle has some stigma since you sometimes still find extremely outdated Guides wich are not reworked after major updates.
---
Hell Lord of the Rings Online and Star Trek Online both successfully implemented DX11 to their engines and they never had those types of resources.
---
I mean, they didn't kill it, they just crippled it a lot, but you're basocally right
---
 Now this is quality end game content
---
So posting trolling videos like this can get upvotes in this community? Just when you thought it couldn't sink any lower....
---
Aegis is very useful. But building around aegis to farm hero points in HoT is a big no. Open world solo builds have to focus on damage, not on full defence. 
---
As a side note, some hero points in HoT are very very hard to solo, so bear that in mind. Stuff like the vampire, balthazar’s rest, etc.
---
A lot of builds stay relevant even after patches, or at least big part of those builds like gear stats, weapons, most of traits etc.
---
Right. Experience taught me that big companies always hold on to their promises and will never lie when they see it profitable. When did that ever happen? xD
---
I don't understand? I see such statments after every patch, but still I see chronos in every grp and they all survive to write the exact same statment again on the next patch... So is this finally the last time or will this go on forever?
---
Don't bring fractal/raid builds into open world PvE. They are fundamentally flawed because they assume you have a team comp - someone pumping out boons. In open world PvE you will more than likely need to be your own source of boons, and you will probably do a lot better with something that provides might and fury.
---
All instanced content builds assume someone is there gifting you 25 stacks of might and perma fury and quickness. In open world that simply isn't the case 90% of the time unless all you do is world bosses.
---
at this point I actually think they will introduce the missing core elite skills soonish
---
I said its earnings are higher now, and then I focused on the last 4 quarters because that is where the trend becomes really obvious. That's all.
---
&gt; The trend is pretty much the same comparing those last 4 quarters, the performance is a bit better, but that is not the same thing as the trend.
---
Then we're basically saying the same thing and merely use the word "trend" differently. The trend you speak of is QoQ, the trend I meant is PoF vs. HoT. We're basically not even disagreeing here.
---
Would be better if it said "11112" for both meter and rhyme :P
---
Lol
---
Obviously everyone has to do his part.
---
If the Druid doesn't heal properly after    a Green explodes, the Group will die even if the Tank distorts himself.
---
And if the DPS are slacking good supporters are wasted as well.
---
Same thing goes for other bosses
---
Worth noting that these skips require the low gravity in the lobby that can only be enabled after completing fractal 100 for the first time.
---
Aren't most Chrono mains in PvE?
---
Alot of people doesn't seem to understand why mesmer is the meta tank. Apart from providing boons, CC and utility (i.e. focus pull) chrono is the best tank because it doesnt have to move to avoid damage because of blocks &amp; distorts. And if you dont move the boss the dps can just focus on dealing damage.
---
I really enjoyed the maps, but in my opinion GW2 does the best open world content and exploration. Also, I like ESO combat the least out of those MMOs, but it is better than Skyrim, except for maybe magic in Skyrim.
---
I have heard that swtor has a pretty good story, but I'm not really into Star Wars.
---
It's just a dumb title aiming to be provocative.
---
Btw I had the time to test this comp since the time I saw you suggest it in another question thread and it indeed makes the runs much smoother even without a very experienced Healbrand. I just need to refine a bit my energy management for some bosses to have the correct weapon and legend up when I need it.
---
The most important thing to know is What content you’ll be playing the most!
---
Worst case scenario is that you chose something you cannot handle and just have bad experience all the time.
---
I have seen a lot of new players got talked into something they cannot handle at all because self proclaimed veterans(casuals that played a long time)
---
I barely know him, no hate. I also mentioned that he does raise some valid concerns.
---
Games like GW2 can profit greatly from hardcore content, even if the majority of players don't even touch it, because it's perfect content for streamers and will give the game lots of exposure on twitch and youtube.
---
&gt; I think even WoW and FFXIV have hit a ceiling for how successful they can be
---
FFXIV has just had a massively successful expansions release. Take a look at this list of the best rated games of 2019: https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/year/all/filtered
---
Oh yeah totally forgot sw 2
---
There is no blue tag rule and people don't have to accept you into their squad.
---
Equally, you can still follow them if they're tagged up anyway.
---
If you play WVW at all, you can use the currency to buy a lot of armor.  There's also a daily called WVW Big Spender that you can complete by buying armor and weapon skins.  That's how I unlocked a lot of them.
---
Oh I see. Yeah , the wings actually annoy me. They just make no in-game sense , they're literally just gem store bait.
---
Well duh. Studio needs money to make things isn't exactly a revolutionary statement. Besides, they have the resources to build upon the game, they lost a lot of people but they're still making good money off the gemshop, plus the net amount of people staffing the game is equal or higher because a lot of the people fired were working on other projects iirc.
---
I expected people to maybe write some interesting comments, and it worked.
---
A new president.
---
I'm gonna point out that Gw2 was heavy touted as a spvp, wvw focused game. Like gw1 the pve content was just there to teach you the mechanics to then go pvp. Slowly over the years they focused to be more pve, because thats where they were getting more money.
---
I read a while ago that the in-house devs working on these mmos (not BDO) are very similar in size, with WoW employing the smallest amount except during crunches, GW2 was the only one with over 300 devs at that time.
---
Somebody needs to do raids like this and record it. Maybe a new challenge for SC.
---
I dont cause cant :)) thx I understand u position
---
IIRC, it's because it's just reskinned GW1 engine, and the people who made it back then don't work at Anet anymore
---
To be fair I fail this turn even without a wall of trees
---
Yep, this.
---
Blue Tag = public zerg but not necessarily open is how I do it as a commander. During the later hours I'm very relaxed about TS but during primetime, esp. if the squad is close to being full, I prefer having players in squad who are also in TS.  
---
Since people who join TS put in "more effort" it should be rewarded with a place in squad.  
---
TS is also useful for stuff that is fight-related but still important. Like fast map-changes because of attacks or sending a small group of people to defend a camp or tower against a small attack so that not the whole zerg has to run to that object.
---
I used to be ashamed of dat lava font rally, but now i just appreciate the added dps
---
Choose your setting:

---
Thank you for the information!
---
FF14's Steam users don't even account to 10% of the playerbase.
---
Ah okay!
---
Just in case no /s it stands for Guild vs Guild and it’s meant to be like 15v15 pvp. Hasn’t seen any support in years and regularly gets destroyed by random balance changes like the removal of scrapper f5. Kind of a meme at this point unfortunately.
---
Thank you!
---
I still think and keep saying to friends that GW2 is an amazing game... it's just that content is very slow at coming out now at the moment so I don't play very much. Which is fine, I'll just start playing again once the next living world/expansion update hits. On a related note, I hope the recent restructuring and refocusing of Anet will start showing, with way more content than LW season 4 was.
---
Thanks for all of the info!
---
&gt; I seriously think people that make this kind of post are just salty they can't have them.
---
So it's impossible for you to fathom that some people don't want to have the game look like a copypaste Asian MMO? Tastes exist. That's why I would prefer client-side display options. People who want to see all the flashy wings/infusions/mounts/gliders, can. People who don't want to have their eyes burned, should be able to opt out of them.
---
Anet *had* the freedom to focus on GW2, they chose not to and instead focused a lot of manpower to other projects. SE doesn't really push for cutting edge, and they honestly kind of play it safe with their patch cycles, but it's always consistent and always more than just story quests.
---
Anet has to say something. Yeah the "we'll let the releases speak for themselves" was great when they were actually releasing shit, but they're not releasing anything atm and people are super down on the game. Somethings gotta give.
---
Just started getting into WvW so will look into it!
---
FFXIV main crowd definitely isn’t hardcore though, outside of Japan less than 10% of the players clear savage raids on average and less than 2% cleared ultimates. You just don’t need to do it to be decently geared or play most of the content of the game, most of it is very casual friendly,  many people play it to RP, dress up their characters, dramamonger around or keep paying their subs to not lose their houses...
---
You’re on point about the archaic grind systems, BfA reception wasn’t the best because of the amount of grind and RNG gating the gear, I tried but it’s just too much, and raiding with 20 people is just too much of a headache because of the logistics involved. Those are decisions that GW2, FFXiV and ESO moved away from that probably caused some of the success at stealing some of the WoW players.
---
Another easy way to bulk your collection is to farm unidentified blue, green and yellow equipment, or buy them from the trading Post. Open the boxes then salvage. A added bonus is yellows give ectos and the others luck. If you don't have coin fed salvage then go for mystic salvage kits.
---
/s was intended, of course. Since gvg is a pure joke, i didnt even bother putting it in
---
If you want to go for the cultural armor, don't forget that you can reduce the gold cost by buying it from the WorldVsWorld vendor. You will need to play WvW to earn the tokens, which won't take long if you join a commander, and you can even activate the [triumphant armor reward track](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Triumphant_Armor_Reward_Track) to earn even more skin in the meantime.
---
Jumping ship to FFXIV was the best decision i ever had!
---
TS and not Discord? Damn, I was hoping most communities had switched over by now so I didn't have to install TS again.
---
Of course, being locked out of something because other people don’t want to do it often is annoying, but imo the scaled up events should have better rewards/some other incentive to actually scale it up. As is, for example, it’s wayyyyy more efficient to have 49 people stay back while one person starts the event, and then have everyone else run in, because a scaled down event is faster, easier, and gives the same rewards most of the time. I’d love for them to implement scaling rewards *hard* so people are encouraged to just run around different zones in a giant open world zerg and complete orange events because they scale up when the squad gets there.
---
Ele's condi damage is overbuffed (and that's coming from an ele main), expect it to be toned down. I just hope they won't wreck the power builds along with it.
---
It’s so sad cause it was so fun, stealth is aids though and now aoe reveal has been deleted.
---
Because most games you pay and play through a fee times.
---
Online games without subscription operate under the same cash shop and lootboxes as GW2 and many are throwing more money at the game than they would’ve if they paid a sub and had that content available through gameplay.
---
People who are actually f2p in these games have to grind insane amounts of hours over people who are putting money into it and the experience is tailored to be miserable to those not paying, specially if they have f2p and an upgrade to premium accounts.
---
TIL that a group of skyscales is called a glory.
---
Now if only Anet would implement ranked 2v2 for us "veterans" who are tired of the 5v5 meta... that would be great. Yeah... I'm sure this will get buried. For some reason any talk about 2v2 gets ignored. Why is that?
---
Just get it off dlgamer, it's on sale there for 20 bucks right now, and they're in anet's list of trusted sites. Nobody knows for sure when the next sale is, August looks possible. 
---
https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43807
---
If you're experienced enough then you wouldn't need to be in squad at all.
---
If you were good enough, comms would know and invite you in the squad anyway.
---
Besides, why are you posting this on reddit instead of your server's discord? Different servers have different rules and mindsets.
---
Ele main, I never really liked sword in open world. It has no range, meaning I need to run around to tag stuff, and it's cleave is very limited. Usually I run either staff, since all it takes is swapping the weapons. And if I'm not lazy swapping FA to BttH. Sometimes I run Scepter/Warhorn Tempest. Especially if you have troubles surviving, go ahead and give it a shot, you can now take Air/Water lines and have that sweet passive healing while keeping up your dps.
---
So you actually chose to have a tantrum
---
Chrono shares boons on top of tanking and Scrapper does zero of that if focusing on damage. I doubt it's even considered for most comps.
---
I use an ipad with gamevice. it's hell for ground targetting, but the rest is ok, did a map completion(base Tyria) with it (on necro MM which is the easiest) but was glad mounts arrived because some vista's were hell
---
&gt; Being able to turn it off for others reduces the value of those items and could possibly reduce profits.
---
I think they could make it opt out. In my experience people don't tend to check the settings/options of anything, so it would be on for most players, but if someone wants to avoid getting their eyes burned, they would be able to.
---
just a wild quetion, but are you playing ranger by any means :P
---
&gt; What you think about BlueTag Rule?
---
never heard of it
---
Earnings show that the game is healthy. Actually more than healthy! But the game is an MMORPG. What makes an MMO arguably great? Well, social aspect, constantly released end game content for every game modes. Does GW2 tick off these boxes? Absolutely not. 
---
Like, take FIFA. The game is great in the menus, EA drops content every 2nd day, you can trade all day, you have flashy cards and nice menu design overall. But the gameplay itself is trash. That alone does not make the game healthy or good. 
---
I'm more than willing to give Anet the benefit of the doubt and I'm hopeful that beginning this Fall we are seeing radical changes and the fruits of their new policy. But at this point I'm fearful too.
---
EA's business practices have gotten world governments to investigate the entite industry's use of loot boxes. That is not sustainable. They may be making a ton of money now but they very well good kill AAA gaming as we know it. So, that is why you can't judge success just by how much money they make.
---
You mean you haven't quit the game since December 2018? Damn. Dedication.
---
I'm so envious that your partner is into GW2 xD I wish mine was too.
---
Yeah but they make both. Money from prescription *and* cosmetics.
---
So...yeah. It's pretty hard to keep up with games who have significantly more recourses, which they do.
---
*Especially* WoW
---
Bigger player base, bigger very long standing/loyal player base etc
---
Wow makes waaay more money through cosmetics than GW - and then they have all the subscription money on top of that
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
&gt; GW2 generated more total earnings since the release of PoF one and a half years ago (3/4Q 2017 - 1Q 2019) than it generated in the same timeframe after the release of HoT (3/4Q 2015 - 1Q 2017). That's quite impressive for a game that's growing older and older and PoF being a lot cheaper at release than HoT.
---
Mount skins.
---
F4 has 40+ sec cooldown so if it was necessary for tanking then those chronos were pretty bad tanks to begin with. "Only" blocks is still a lot of blocks.
---
In order for scrapper to be a competitive tank it would need 30k dps benchmark which will never happen since it's not very balanced.
---
 Anything that does, slow, stun, kcockback, knockdown, pushback, chill, fear, pull. I think thats it, unless im missing any  status. but if the skill has any of those in its effects, it will  hit that breakbar. HOw muh it will  depends on the length of the effect if im not mistaken and  which effect it is.
---
&gt; lowest character model quality
---
When you play with minimum settings, some enemy AoE may not render. I had this happen to me when I had to play on a potato PC, and died because I couldn't see where to run, even though I know that encounter by heart.
---
At least they *did* eventually introduce an option for muting other players' item sounds.
---
It was in the past, yes. But that's Reddit. Most other communities for GW2 aren't like that.
---
But I think this changed **heavily** in the past months/years. I'm not an active player and only see posts on my frontpage, but it's mostly just drawings, updates, and random casual stuff. In the past there were videos about speed clears or other cool stuff so often, but now it feels like it's not valuable anymore to visit the subreddit.
---
Only classes that bring quickness and maybe banner slave can probably get away with doing nothing else. Every other non dps role usually needs to do something special (and dps themselves have to be special in that they need competitive numbers). For example, even though we have several perfectly fine healer options, Druid is still meta in raids due to spotter and spirits (no other healer brings those)—note in fractals, where those aren’t as strong, Druid is not meta or much used in CM groups.
---
&gt; I always think that Blue Com color is public without any restriction.
---
It's cute that you think that, but your thoughts have nothing to do with anyone else's game. 
---
&gt; Ts/discord not SO important for experienced players.
---
Oh, nevermind. I didn't realize you were clueless.
---
It is expansion looked it seems
---
It also culls enemy AoE sometimes. When I played on a potato PC a few weeks ago, I was killed by the VB matriarch's acid field, because it was invisible on minimum settings O.o
---
Until you've gone to the [Wardrobe Unlock Analyser](http://immortius.net.au/wardrobe-unlock-analyser/) and entered an API key for your account, trying to locate additional skins is just a huge waste of time. The Wardrobe Unlock Analyser will show you exactly what you're missing, exactly what you need to purchase/obtain them, and exactly where to purchase/obtain them.
---
That's a pretty big asterisk. "The combat is good... in PvP only"
---
I hate to break it to you, but people go to MMOs for the PvE. There is an abundance of very good PvP-focused multiplayer games out there right now, and MMO PvP is always a side project.
---
The combat needs to be good in PvE, it doesn't really matter what it's like in PvP modes.
---
It's SO much fun. This game is so great to duo. Makes everything so much more lively. (honestly a great starter game if your SO isn't into games. This or Team Fortress 2).
---
personaly arcane fresh air weaver and just dunk everything that comes near me zerker gear some with vitality just cause scholar runes sword/dagger. anything veteran  and lower you can dunk super fast even if there is multiple of them just get them closed to each other. you'll spend most of the time in fire/air vise versa 1st basic attack skills in both are strong which is so nice on eyes now, rotation for my dunk being in fire/air skill 2 engage or 4 then use the other not used skill 3 as it's casting switch to air/fire skill 5 then 4  this should kill almost anything really easy if not go ahead to full air and use skill 3 and then cool air back flip 5 skill, now if thing still being stubborn about meeting his maker this is judgement time do I go to earth for cc and blast in a fire field or go for water healing evasion your call remember exploit fresh airs trait to keep getting those lighting strikes on them. Champions in the open world maybe I'll make a proper post with actual skill names for now this is awesome and works for me I rarely go down unless I f up,
---
You realize that those employees were likely pulled off and made to work on side-projects on the behest of NCSoft, right? Specially if they, as people claim, were mobile projects.
---
Yes. Well. Evil minon #16, remove this chap's legs up to the knees if you please.
---
Pls dont
---
I mean... out of all the mmos i've played, GW2 gameplay is by far my least favorite. Don't ask me why. Personal preference.
---
NCSOFT generally gives their western studios free will to do what they want as long as generate a decent profit. The side projects cancelled by them were not the first ones Anet had since GW2, in fact. There have been multiple others cancelled quietly under Anet's NDAs and thus leave the company in a high churn rate.
---
F
---
Hahahahahaha, you sir, made my day
---
You have a problem with balance, not combat mechanics themselves. 
---
At high level PvP the combat has shined tremendously over the years (with bad balance effecting detrimentally over time)
---
Balance is fixable if they had the right level of focus, whereas to fix combat mechanics if it was bad, they would need to overhaul the whole base game.
---
&gt; Revenue is up because of more tantalising monitization practice in the form of flashy mounts which you see everywhere in game.
---
I would love to see your citation for that. 
---
&gt; You cannot equate account creation to selling of boxed copies of the game as the base game is free to play and so you have zero information as to how many of those accounts actually go on to buy the expansions.
---
As said in the OP, best we have is the statistics from gw2efficiency, which is admittedly a very skewed data set. But that's the thing: that's all we have. It's not much, but it's more than the support that you have for your opinions, which is actually literally nothing. 
---
&gt; And who exactly are these new players that you go about?
---
Go on Facebook some time. The game is advertised pretty well there, and the main group is fairly active and has a lot of new (and casual) players. 
---
&gt; No, I find it much more likely that GW2 is basically being propped up by those that stuck with it and sunk either a lot of money or time or both and find it hard to move on.
---
Translation: "I have no evidence for this and I'm ok with that because it reaffirms my beliefs of ded gaem".
---
You're a bit of a handful mate. Maybe stop being so full of yourself, yeah?
---
The combat is good, because the combat is the same in all modes. Again, the fact that PvE content is developed/balanced in such a way that it doesn't utilise the combat to its full potential isn't an issue with the combat, it is an issue with PvE content/balancing. The two are easy to mix up.
---
If the combat can be good in one more, then it can be good in every mode, but not every mode utilises it properly.
---
I hate to break it to you, but that is wholly subjective. I play GW2 for purely PvP, and most other large PvP games a far too simplistic imo (easy to access as an aim, and GW2 is most criticised for it's combat being too complex for new audiences)
---
Just because MMOs have failed to capitalise on the PvP audience, it doesn't mean that they can't. Again, no MMO has had combat as polished or strong as GW2, but they have definitely utilised their mediocre combat better in content.
---
How would you know if you haven’t read it? There was not a single insult in that comment, I just suggested that you might hold your conclusions before going angry and judging. Aren’t you yourself being condescending with all this attitude?
---
Aegis saved my butt whenever I ran past some strong mobs and tried not to die haha! I really love my Dragonhunter/Firebrand because I love setting the traps and slashing enemies with my sword. I wanted to be both so bad so now it's split between DH on PVE and Firebrand Support on PVP.
---
Ranger main, can confirm all of these.
---
its a joke compared to wow mythic raids
---
Mind posting / sharing your controller setup?
---
Even if all your highly speculative anecdotal evidence is true and the playerbase actually is growing (which is borderline delusional to believe IMO), what does that do for vets?
---
Just because new people are checking the game out, that doesn't somehow magically eliminate the fact that the game has zero attention to repeatable endgame content. And all these happy new players will soon realize this and quit along with the rest of us.
---
Hooking people into early game for few-month bursts does not fix the fundamental problems with this game and will not help with veteran retention. And thinking that Anet is going to do a complete 180 and actually listen to what vets want after nearly 7 years of disappointment is a total pipe dream. People need to accept that this game is finished and move on to better things.
---
I use a Steam controller. If you are an action cam user then it is almost perfect and I play just as well as I do with my MMO mouse. You do need to have a KB handy nearby for chatting.
---
I do for this with eve 🙃 never attempted it with gw2 though
---
Lie more. Gorse infus show even in best performance settings. OMEGALUL
---
lmao facebook really XD totally the best place to be putting adds for a 6 year old game in this day.
---
As far as I'm aware because the general nature of GW2 being a super casual playerbase most people think that GW2 efficiency accounts for less than 20% of the playerbase. So any increase in that site might be players which have been playing for years but for whatever reason haven't made an account at GW2 efficiency. For this reason GW2 efficiency numbers can mean something sure but they can also mean absolutely nothing except a couple of long time players have finally decided to join the platform. 
---
At the end of the day actions speak louder than words and so far Anet has yet to give either of these. If you want to have a positive outlook on the future of this game by all means go ahead, but there is a reason myself and by the looks of it a lot of others think the way we do and trying to brush those concerns under the mat doesn't mean they will magically go away. 
---
If you enjoy the content Anet is putting out then there should be no need for you to worry about what the rest of us think just keep supporting the game and I'm sure you'll be fine.
---
As far as I can tell, the convention goes like this in my world and when I'm in the Edge:
---
* Blue: Quick-join public squad. May or may not require audio. 
---
* Purple: Organized public map-jumping squad with audio (you have to join their VOIP, like teamspeak or discord)
---
* Yellow: Guild 'raids'. 
---
* Red: Small groups, randoms and roamers messing around. 
---
Of course, that doesn't mean everyone will abide to this.
---
Wow you people really will cling to just about anything to give false hope that this dead game isnt dead. Games dead, accept it and move on
---
&gt; This game has so much potential.
---
and it has since day 1 but anet keeps squandering that potential and has never once gone in the right direction and i can gurantee they arent gonna start now, especially after they just canned like half the studio lmao
---
next living world is just gonna be more of the same boring missions and maps you play once and never touch again. there isn't gonna be some big iteration and innovation that will magically bring back people who quit, and even if they do add something new (they wont), it too little too late. People have already moved on to better things (except for the few delusional white knights on this sub that refuse to accept the truth about this game)
---
[The goggles did something.](https://i.imgur.com/zpQfdlV.jpg)
---
&gt; lmao facebook really XD totally the best place to be putting adds for a 6 year old game in this day.
---
I mean, look at the financials, seems to be working. 
---
&gt; For this reason GW2 efficiency numbers can mean something sure but they can also mean absolutely nothing except a couple of long time players have finally decided to join the platform.
---
I know. That's why I'm not saying it's definitely proven true. I'm saying it's some evidence, and you have none. 
---
&gt; If you enjoy the content Anet is putting out then there should be no need for you to worry about what the rest of us think just keep supporting the game and I'm sure you'll be fine.
---
I'm not concerned about the game. I call out bullshit arguments wherever I see them. It's not about protecting the game, the game doesn't need my damn protection. I just don't like people acting like they know something that they clearly do not and cannot know.
---
Ty for sharing u vision!
---
Apologies for questionable grammar or wording, I am on my phone.
---
You saying an industry standard used to rate systems in various levels of polish and performance is subjective, is like me saying healthcare is subjective. If a patient died due to poor healthcare but the patient wanted to die, then the healthcare is good. Subjectively speaking. No of course not, people would still see it as bad healthcare. You can't just wave anything you disagree with as subjective.
---
I have played both too, and you are the first I have encountered as a very active member in many community discords, but even aside from that, a general reputation says a lot. A few dissenters will always arise to counter popular opinion. The vast majority of streamers who have played both will tell you GW2 has the better combat system (the mechanics themselves and the polish if the engine) Look at Teapot, at Jawgeous, at Last Peon, at Jebro (which plays more ESO mainly than gw2 ATM). 
---
Yet someone like Jebro would still say they enjoy ESO more, because if player experience. This isn't a purely combat thing. GW2 could have the best combat in MMOs (and arguably does) but the player experience is lackluster due to how it is utilis d by the content. People need to stop conflating player experience with mechanics, they are not the same thing. How good combat is (lag time, skill delay and after cast, animation fluidity/quality, weight and flow etc) has an industry standard, and thus can be the best but still result in dissatisfaction due to poor balancing, neglect and or poor utilisation in content. This latter is what you are mixing up with the former.
---
This JackDaniels guy, I am curious, how long did he play GW2, how far sis he make it? The only content which utilised GW2's combat properly is high level competitive, and correct me if I'm wrong but he hasn't ever appeared there. Jebro has an understanding of both at a high level and he would and has agreed with me on his Twitch streams before. Why does this matter? If a game doesn't utilise it's amazing combat properly then you won't realise until you have played at the level/mode where it does. This is why. If you said "Yes but GW2 sucks at utilising the amazing combat by making casual/low engagement content and neglecting balance" then yes I would wholeeheartedly agree with you, which is why I would like that to change.
---
As for ROM, I have discuss d this before with him on his Twitch stream and on voice in discord, albeit while he was drunk, and he will tell you 'GW2 has some or the best combat but the worst management. It is a complex and intricate combat system and PvP, more so than many many other games, but caters its content to a casual market, making it a wholly unfulfilling player experience'.
---
The fact balance has been rocky since expansions is a balance issue. The combat mechanics are the same as core. 
---
ANET needs to decide if it wants an easy and satisfying combat experience that focuses on story (not currently, because the combat is made complex and difficult to balance in such a way) or a combat focused game that is focused on invested players. Anet thinks it has the former, but I think the latter would be better for GW2 imo, based on the fact it doesn't have much to rival the other MMOs other than it's combat systems.
---
Them doing fine financially doesn't magically fix the blatant problems with endgame. People aren't going to decide not to quit the game just because Anet has money
---
You can probably tell from my priorities, but I lean strongly toward rp and immersion haha
---
There's all the dungeon armor sets which are nice and the living story achievement ones (you can get all of those from WvW reward tracks as well)
---
Actually any good com is a gvg guild member (or former member) and we all know eachother there. So yea, you get invited and put in coms party if you are known.
---
Blue and green are usually pugmanding or open commanding for TS/Discord. Other colors are most likely ts/discord only or just a guild raid. No matter the color, my guild is still being asked "is it open?", so any color would do :)
---
This is the one I have had the most fun with and the only one that beats Reaper and Dragonhunter in open world DPS on events and such.
---
Still just feels HARD.
---
Volatile Magic compared to Unbound is so bad implemented its not even funny. I used to unlock everything in previous seasons but now i dont even bother. People will tell you just do the Kourna Meta but how much? Its just so damn boring to do the same event again and again and again just to get a couple of cosmetic stuff you are not going to use. They way they have done stuff lately pushes you do very specific content repeatedly until you hate the game.
---
Revenant - I love toggle skills,no idea why.  Vengeful Hammers makes me very happy.  I dig doing damage when I'm knocked on my butt because my reflexes are 47 years old.  
---
Warrior - well, *asura* warrior.  Spin, chop, levitate, meaty hits, ground speed, throwing axes, rifle pew-pew just for fun, heavy armor, signets when I'm lazy and kicking foes when I'm not.  Shield bashes, shouting, dropping banners.  I am never, ever bored.  Also never skeered of groups of mobs or champions.
---
I agree with what the points with what other posters have made, but I want to stress the core concept of their reasoning.
---
No matter your actual setup, an ideal (i.e. standard) raid composition consists of the following:
---
* Reliable source(s) of 25 Might for all 10 characters,
---
* Reliable source(s) of Fury for all 10 characters,
---
* Reliable source(s) of Quickness for all 10 characters,
---
* Reliable source(s) of Alacrity for all 10 characters,
---
* A banner slave,
---
* A ranger spirit slave,
---
* Reliable healing for all 10 characters, and
---
* Reliable DPS
---
I say ideal because you can certainly complete raid encounters without needing every single one of the above. There was mention about the ability to tank, or otherwise evade mechanics in place, but those are more a question of optimization, in my opinion.
---
Currently, two of the most popular tanks I've seen used in raids  are the classic chronomancer, and the up-and-coming healbrand. So let's see what each brings.
---
A chronomancer tank provides Quickness and Alacrity, and extends boons for all 10 characters. This allows the rest of the squad to either run the old meta composition, or have a quickbrand and alacren (DPS or heal variant) to cover boons for the rest of the squad. Slot in a druid and banner slave, and you're good to go.
---
A minstrel healbrand provides Quickness and very reliable healing for themselves, and their subgroup. I'm talking about 4-7k hp/s on Soulless Horror kind of reliable. This again, allows the comp to run similar to the above without any trouble.
---
Now, in regards to scrapper tanks. Even before today's patch, scrappers already had the sustain to be a reliable tank. . . if all they needed to worry about was taking and self-sustaining through damage. However, to fit a scrapper tank into the composition, your squad would still need to five other support roles, thereby removing one whole DPS slot. Worse is that the tradeoff is, well, non-existent. A scrapper tank doesn't bring ANYTHING to the table to fit the needs of a raid composition, and your squad's losing 10-20k dps.
---
As far as I can see everyone's evidence is anacdotal at best and no one but Anet knows the true story which they won't saying anything about. I would call what myself and others have been doing as an educated guess with what information we do have on the current situation, information on things from other games and the current trend in content being released by Anet.
---
We might all be proven wrong once Anet finally decides to show something but I personally am not going to be expecting anything but the bare minimum.  
---
Anyway nothing else to discuss so peace dude.
---
Scholar runes alone cost \~30g a set. And while there are cheaper alternatives, several deviations from the meta can add up quickly... You're right in that ascended gear isn't necessary though.
---
Oh yea, december 2018 was when i quit too
---
Maybe on some servers, but definitely not on all. I would not call it a "general rule". With server matches changing from time to time you cannot expect others to know or even follow a convention made up by one particular server.
---
&gt; The mobs aren't even there for a heart nor quest, pose no interesting challenge, and yield no reward.
---
Yes... they just want to kill you. You know, like enemies and wild beasts do.
---
Might be because this course doesn't already have several actual collideable bushes/stumps in the way on the track. Also might be because the tracks for the beetle race event had much tighter time constraints for hitting gold. For this one, you can totally fly past one of the checkpoints, have to turn back around to go get it, and then get going again and still make gold.
---
WvW chronos died out and pvp ones evolved to mirage and than died
---
Only ranger and now mesmer
---
I got dizzy seeing the linked site . xD
---
&gt; What you think about BlueTag Rule? 
---
Never heard of it tbh
---
Does not open for me. I mean snowcrows.com.

Scrapper has two primary blocking skills -- on hammer 2s block every 20s or with shield every 24s when traited. Another one on gear shield with 20s cooldown. Evade with rocket charge but good luck positioning that charge. (we can ignore Sylvari giving 2s shield on 45s cooldown for now)
---
Chrono has two 1.5s blocking with shield (30s overall cooldown), 1s blurred frienzy on main sword with 10s cooldown. So more blocks/evades. Scepter has a channeling block, off-hand sword had riposte (though dangerous when precise positioning is required). There's also well of precog on 30s cooldown. Signets give blurred frenzy when traited. 
---
So overall it's much easier to block on chrono without moving around too much. Bonus -- you give quickness/alacrity by just using shield and kinda extend boons. Throw in alacrity well and you're also useful to the group :D
---
New logic seems to be very backwards (or whoever did this is trying his/her best to "make tanky fighter" -- kind of same as what ANet did to reaper before they started backpedaling and removing heal-on-hit from being in shroud). You can't go full tank as your DPS would be very bad to use it. If you get enough DPS then barrier won't save you because you will be mega squish. If you try to give boons to the group you need boon duration or still chrono to extend it. So... awkward, backwards, might work as a half-assed solution, much worse than either guardian or just chrono.
---
Recent mining in data hints on something called "item customisation" and a possible link to scribbing. 
---
Nobody knows what's this gonna be, but who knows if it's not something about auras and such
---
Those mobs drop precursors. Just kill them and try your luck. If no drop yet, you are killing too few of them!
---
Raids are a thing lately?
---
I personally think they're just having fun with their look.
---
Just test the weapons out and see what you like.  About the only sets I'd warn you against are Pistol/Dagger (condition damage focused, which won't be as good while levelling) and Pistol/Pistol (can be effective, but only by pushing 3 a lot, which isn't really engaging gameplay).
---
Dagger/Dagger and Dagger/Pistol let you mess around with Backstab, a very damaging stealth attack.  Sword/Pistol lets you use blind fields to cleave down groups of enemies, and is probably more effective than Sword/Dagger.  Shortbow isn't the most powerful ranged weapon but offers a lot of utility and is a good weapon to practice as a result.
---
Pve chrono is fine, just lost a panic button (we have several already) and feels a bit worse when dealing with trash. Otherwise nothing really has changed, dps and boonshare rotations are the same as before. Don't let this stop you.
---
PvP/wvw chronos on the other hand...
---
&gt; There really wasn't.
---
Except there really was?
---
I was a big critic of S1 because I hated how content kept getting removed or how existing maps ended up getting reworked instead of new ones being added. 
---
BUT I have never felt a level of excitement about GW2 I did in S1. There was variety. Regular content drops. Cool rewards. I had *fun*.
---
The molten alliance dungeon and the marionette event in my opinion are highpoints of GW2 design - both as instanced and open world conent. Those were the only times when I thought Anet finally did something the the potential in combat system or even the open world setting.
---
Eversince S2 they haven't taken any risks, they started going for boring and easymode content releases at a worse release pace. They are permanent now, cool. Not like anyone evr does those LS maps a month after they are out. But that is the only step up from S1, in every regard these new seasons were far worse.
---
so essentially what you're saying "im 2 lazy to go for a walk so i just walk around in a videogame. therefore the game should make more content that i don't really like but i do because i'm to lazy to do anything else."
---
raiding isn't difficult in this game, people are just lazy about it.
---
The game is fine and will continue to be fine. Reddit is filled with negative Jim Sterling fans who hate everything and don't understand their outlook is the problem, meanwhile there's plenty of players who are just enjoying the game.
---
&gt;It's honestly just completely insane to me that they've moved so far away from dungeons.
---
They just don't know what they're doing. It's always trying new stuff over and over again just for the sake of it. If you ever happen to love a part of the game, well, get ready to be sad when said part is inevitably thrown away to make space for the new shiny no one wanted and no one asked for.
---
This game's biggest problem has always been direction and management.
---
Resources have always been there, and they still are. They just waste them on pointless bullshit, like spectacular visuals, which no one is going to give a damn about anyway, since visuals are useless without an experience to back them up. Pretty much like those shitty Transformers movies, which spend all their budget on the explosions and don't give a shit about everything else.
---
The game is not dead, but it's far from alive either. Feels like a corpse on a parade.
---
Players worked hard to get those visual cosmetics and you want a button to switch it off, nullifying their achievement.
---
Silence means uncertainty. Silence drives away investment.
---
prolly should
---
The zero replay aspect is entirely untrue. Let's try and actually keep our criticisms focused and not hyperbolic. It might not be something *you* want to replay but that doesn't mean that metas like Dragonfall don't constantly attract players.
---
What I presume you, many other players and myself want is better repeatable instanced content. An easy raid mode to get players in and truly repeatable CMs is what is needed, as shown by MMOs like WoW and FFXIV. However, we aren't going to get content like that as long as the bigger names in the community lash out against that as a suggestion.
---
The other option to make content repeatable is to introduce gear progression - that is what keeps playing non-instanced content in other MMOs - and that would probably go down like a lead balloon if suggested as a direction for Guild Wars 2.
---
I don't think most of them play the game at all, and I don't blame them, you don't need to be a dedicated gamer to do a good job.
---
You leaders and managers, the ones taking the decisions, however... Either they start playing, or they better hire someone to play for them.
---
I really liked condi weaver on PoF launch, can you use sword still?
---
I dont think GW2 is even close to ESO and FFXIV
---
And Cantha is gonna pay for it.
---
&gt; Leadership which lies to your face. 
---
No surprise seeing how they treat their own customers in the first place.
---
Simply not possible witht he current product.  It would be more efficient to start over than try to improve GW2 to the point where it would become an industry leader.
---
Pre-HoT wasn't much better, with CoF1 sucking the life off dungeons and ArenaNet doing nothing to nerf it even a bit.
---
Then they repeated the same mistake with Silverwastes, Tarir, and Palawadan. Because hey, why make content interesting when you can force everyone into braindead farms in the same maps for months and months.
---
&gt;I know I've been playing for years and now I log in at least 4-5 nights a week...but if they added a $5/mo subscription tomorrow I'd drop the game like an 8am elective and never once look back. Even though I put in about $100/yr for gems I do it at my own pace and on my own terms. Changing to a subscription model would totally change how I view the game.
---
&gt;I suspect a great many others would also leave and never come back. Not even for any possible GW3.
---
That train of thought seems to be pretty common, why is it though?
---
The value for money you get from an MMO subscription is better than going to the movies even if you're only playing 1 hour a week.
---
Don't you think it's worth paying for a game that doesn't concede good game design to sell cash shop items?
---
[You between stampedes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGxolwfD5yw)
---
&gt; I'd love more content releases but it really feels like the Guild Wars 2 community is hyper critical about downtime between releases. 
---
More like releases are absolute "single player" trash you consume in a few hours, then go back into the waiting line.
---
It's not too big of a difference compared to what it was before this balance patch. I don't tend to trust benchmarks by themselves and prefer to go by logs from actual encounters. For instance with MO, I would usually end the fight at an average of 33k. Now I am averaging 35k. So it is definitely a buff, but it's not brokenly OP by any means. It's just a bump.
---
how about instead of doing it this way have each of the grandmasters apply to 1 of the "roles"
---
move **Kinetic Stabilizers** into the GM-Minor trait and give it the -300 vitality (sacrificing weight/bulk for speed/stability)
---
- **Adaptive Armor**: Gain barrier based on Outgoing Healing you do; x% 
---
 outgoing healing is more effective. (y%)
---
- **Impact Savant**: Gain Barrier based on Damage you do; x%; 
---
 gain Quickness when struck while above Might threshold.
---
- **Corrosive Armor**: Gain Barrier based on Condition Damage you do; x%
---
 Conditions are more Effective (+% Condi Damage &amp; Duration)
---
This was Legion...  
---
But sure, you needed someone to tank and someone to heal. But I also did my time tanking in LFR, the only content comparable in mindnumbingness is world bosses.  
---
That's really just the problem with non-threatening damage sponges.
---
Wow classic next month
---
I haven't seen it once since until today.. been playing 5 years straight.. although I don't check LFG daily.. does this happen often?
---
Occasionally a boss with a mechanic that can actually kill you, even in LFR.  
---
And tons upon tons of people complaining about it.
---
&gt;but it's not brokenly OP by any means
---
I don't think it's broken either, that doesn't mean it was a good change, it powercrept a build that wasn't underperforming.
---
Mby stop being so selv absorbed...
---
80% of it's playerbase will quit by level 27, when they run out of quests, and discover that they are less than half-way there towards a mount.
---
Half of the rest will quit at 43, and half of the rest at 60, when they realize that the only way to progress your character at level cap is to raid. (And heaven help you if the only guild on your server that raids at times good for you is managed by a clique of douchelords. Your options will consist of quitting the game, quitting your job, or hating every minute of your raids.)
---
I'm shure they will change the whole game just because you can't play.
---
&gt; Started a couple of days ago
---
Your feedback is immediately invalid as far as health of the game and endgame content or balance in general is concerned.
---
You barely know him and yet you make a comment on him. It's true, lately some of his stream has been depressing but dont misunderstand why its depressing. Watch his stream for more than 5 minutes and you'll understand. Im only defending him because I agree with most of what he says (90% of the time) and because he doesn't like to defend himself on reddit
---
The dude is literally the only one organizing a major guild wars 2 event; a competition to gather players across NA and EU and he cant even find enough players between BOTH servers. He has a total of  60 people participating between 
---
NA and EU.
---
Teapot cares for the game but anet doesnt care for players like him. So yeah, it's depressing as fuck. Players across game mode like pvp, wvw, raids, dungeons, fractals, and living story are getting shit on.
---
As I mentioned in a previous comment, it's true the game is not "dead" it just turned into a single player rpg. Casuals come and go (they go once they figure out they are getting dog shit too, like everyone else), there will always be casuals so the game will not "die" for some time. Props to anet for targeting gamers that are parents with loads of money and little time.
---
&gt;Except there really was?
---
Nah. LS1's abject failure says everything in this regard. It was boring and unengaging.
---
&gt;BUT I have never felt a level of excitement for GW2 as I did in S1. There was variety. Regular content drops. Cool rewards. I had fun.
---
Mhmm, even if we put side the nostalgia goggles aspect, there are always a few that will enjoy and defend the No Man's Skies and Fallout 76s that get released no matter what. You *might* have had fun, the majority didn't.
---
&gt;The molten alliance dungeon and the marionette event in my opinion are highpoints of GW2 design - both as instanced and open world conent. Those were the only times when I thought Anet finally did something creative with the potential in the combat system or even the open world setting.
---
If that is the high point of GW2's design, then the game is doomed to mediocrity.
---
&gt;Eversince S2 they haven't taken any risks, they started going for boring and easymode content releases at a worse release pace.
---
They tried "taking risks", and the result was a distinctly flawed game foundation and an awful first 1-2 years post-release. Putting aside the gimmicks, marketing nonsense and wide-eyed "hey you know what would be cool" for solid, reliable content was the best decision they've made in the game's history.
---
Temporary content was absolutely a major issue with LS1, but if the content was really as good as you laud it to be, it would've shined through. Only it didn't, because it wasn't.
---
&gt;Not like anyone ever does those LS maps a month after they are out. But that is the only step up from S1, in every regard these new seasons were far worse.
---
Ah yes, now this is the crux of the issue. The problem isn't that the post-LS1 content is bad, it's that it's not catered to you.
---
Because 250 employees are ArenaNet aren't just sitting around watching anime and masturbating.  
---
Believe it or not, almost all games developers are very passionate about their work and pour their heart and soul into it. Those who were laid off tend to complain more of missing the atmosphere and the joy of working there than anything else.  
---
This is an important time for them. They have to prove to us (and more importantly, the shareholders) that they are an effective team and can generate content that invigorates the playerbase. The very future of the company depends upon it.
---
I am still theorizing that scepter would be more viable than sword tho, since it spams illusions needed for the shatters.
---
Unlock crit for invigorating precision 
---
After that get deadly arts if you want more damage 
---
S/p can work well unless you want to stealth, then use d/d or d/p depending on how much cc and mobility you want. P/p for a second weapon set.
---
If you want to be more tanky replace deadly arts for acro. Lots of good shit there like hard to catch. 
---
3rd line pick up the other line you didnt get until daredevil,  then you can use crit da dd for damages or crit acro dd for openworld faceroll. Use staff pp
---
Deadeye use with crit da and rifle dd
---
Ele is much too strong again it seems. They nerfed underperforming builds and buffed builds that were already working fine this patch, so guess we're going back in the direction of one DPS build being the optimal choice for everything again.
---
Does going water and air once every weave self and use 1-2 skills and other than that only rotating fire earth really count as using all 4 attunements and every skill being worth usage? If so, tempest is also swapping into water and earth for using one skill, fa weaver also swaps water, power staff swaps earth and air. The rotation of condo weaver before this patch was actually more flexible than it is now as you rotated between 3 elements out of weaveself permanently.
---
I have to agree. Even it it's not the easiest and not the best in open world, the flow o playing Weaver is really, really nice. It does take some time to get used to it, though...
---
The way I see it, Anet's vision for GW2 was the following: find the type of players who require no content, they don't want to work for rewards so they are fine buying them, and make this community feel so good about themselves (best community evah) that they'll snuff out any valid criticism of the game because criticising daddy Anet would make you not the best, most friendly community evah.
---
They wanted people who are basically just gemstore slaves, never complain, and never talk. And they got it. Hats off to them.
---
You are giving them the benefit of the doubt that they aren't a shady no effort company now, that's why I called you naive.
---
The state of the game/company is especially sad because GW1 offered plenty of content for the hardcore players, especially PvPers. GW2 doesn't feel like a sequel. So the people who stuck with Anet from the start and helped fund GW2 feel betrayed. GW2 itself didn't start out as a casual game either - Anet prided themselves on how hard explorable paths would be at the release of the game and spent 3 years (and about 400-500k $ ) marketing this game as an e-sport.
---
They just don't care anymore. They have their obedient gemstore regulars now and the rest can go to hell. It's sad.
---
I still want to make an Armor out of that gate.
---
as in, runes that used traps will be adjusted, numbers will be adjusted and bugs fixed. its just 2 days after patch day, things are gonna be analyzed. Take note that the boss rush is also a way for them to test skills data as well.
---
Try to check out MetaBattle! They have outstanding guide on leveling builds of each class. It’s quite useful for me.
---
I have never heard of this rule.
---
Well I really like my scepter/focus too, so yeah, scepter is also in
---
I need a dervish, and greatsword revenant
---
&gt;But the event was utterly garbage. It was awful. Culling, latency issues, disconnects, insipid zerg fights.
---
It was honestly the game's rock bottom for me, after being disappointed as is with the base game's experience post level-30, TLS killed any enthusiasm I had for GW2 at the time.
---
It wasn't until LS2 that the game managed to deliver an engaging experience and start fixing some of the major flaws with the base design.
---
I don't know about PvE, but in PvP the amount of barrier you generate from Impact Savant is immediately lost to Retaliation most of the time. It's extremely minor.
---
They've removed most of the sustain from scrapper, making anything but a full tank impossible to play (and full tanks benefit even less from Impact Savants to the point where that trait virtually doesn't exist). It cannot be fixed unless another rework happens.
---
that's already in place I believe; half your total health is the maximum barrier you can get.
---
Yeah in no way is this using every single skill on your bar. It's not even close. Especially dagger condi weaver seems much less engaging than the old sword rotation, but benches better.
---
I guess it's just preference, but I'd rather know exactly what I will be spending per month, then have a fluctuating amount that varies patch by patch.
---
And I absolutely despise having to pay for solutions to problems that developers make themselves.
---
&gt; And it scales badly.
---
It just goes from bad to worse. Even with small number of people the number of kegs required is way too high.
---
Every class can be played as a condition build.
---
Ehh word of warning, the way defenses work here if you try to really do the affliction thing you'll run out of active defenses and eventually die to soling big enough targets.
---
That said... I think Renegade and maybe staff mirage will get you the feel you're after. Both are ranged-capable condi-centric options with high survivability (use runes of torment in a renegade) and competent open world strength. Scourge seems more warlocky but I don't have a necromancer yet.
---
I have a level 80 from launch. If I buy HoT, do I still have to wait until level 80 to specialize my thief?
---
Big idea: invent piano songs based on ele/engi rotations
---
I wish they would get rid of AR.
---
I'll definitely check that out. Thanks!
---
Just stack Renegades and Blood Magic Necros and life leech the heck outa the door
---
Thanks. Map completion for exp is on of my favorite parts of this game.
---
We have drama queens in the community and other players from other games who like to put us down. Of course it's doing better than what people admit. It's the only mmo that has been surviving and doing really well for 7 years with ai different more fair and accessible business model and different gameplay aspects (that makes it a breath of fresh air for players like me that are tired of the grindy meta out there). Also, arenanet takes a while to add systems in game (mounts for ex) but boy, do they always try to bring something surprising. 
---
Hope we continue like this.
---
Double pistol has been my jam. Got secondary as bow for AoE during events
---
There are usually a bunch of them in the same area. Both can end up spamming CCs. Knockdown from jacarandas and pulls from ibogas. Neither are particularly dangerous but they are an annoyance when combined with their aggro range.
---
Funny because I thought the opposite. I agree on the fact that in pve some elements are underused, but I've always felt that lack of single element specialization like in gw1. Fresh air builds are the closest thing to that
---
Yeah, I'm considering it, but it's not quite the same. Power staff was just such an ancient and long-lived iconic mage build. It was the BLM of GW2. I'm mainly off leveling a BLM right now because GW2 lost theirs and there's not much sign that it'll ever return.
---
funny thing, today i found that it's a pain in wvw roaming.
---
It's already got better burst than power ele builds.
---
How can you learn about rotations for ele? I recently started playing the game, but up to this point haven't really tried any dedicated lines for skill use. Im hoping to optimize my lines so when I queue up with people for fractals and such, I'm not dead weight
---
Ok firstly, you appealed to authority first, don't move the goal posts now when you no longer feel like you have the upper hand. If the opinions of Jebro and ROM are irrelevant then so is this JackDaniels guy. So let's stop here, but I request next time you don't try to use it to counter a point if you aren't willing to hear a rebuttal in kind.
---
Secondly, a large part of your reply is irrelevant, because I only ever stated MMO specifically and we are talking about MMOs. Not shooters. Not fighting games. Whether MMOs should be your go to for PvP? Now that is the most subjective thing in this entire discussion. So no, I just disagree, but I can respect your subjective opinion on that note.
---
As for your relevant points, even your own example fails to represent what you think it does. Yes, waiting times being universally bad is a fair assumption, yet someone like you may come along and say it is subjective because you enjoy talking to others in the waiting lobby. Sounds ridiculous right? Well so is pretending badly implement combat mechanics and engine polish is subjective too. The experience is subjective, but the industry standard is not. It isn't that complicated to differentiate, which you seem to keep ignoring.
---
And your film example doesn't aid you either. Have you ever heard people say "I dislike the film but it had good cinematography and camera work"? Most definitely. That is because many facets go into a film. You can't compare a games combat engine with the whole package of another entertainment medium. You can say GW2 is a bad game, certainly, you can say you dislike PvP, certainly. Yet, based on industry standard the same way camera work might be in a film, you can't just discount the objective design of combat mechanics/systems. So no, your example does nothing to support you there.
---
MMOs are indeed still in decline. I don't see how this is relevant to where ANET should focus when trying to market or grow their game? My simple proposition is that their combat engine and systems as reputed by many, as industry standard (all of which you have just said you disagree due to player experience, and not combat systems) and by all of the most invested players in the games future; should become their focus, and they should capitalise on that strength.
---
What is your proposition? Slowly lie down and let the game die I guess? (Odd to argue such in a thread titled the way it is) Because atm, focusing on no strengths when marketing for the game is getting them nowhere.
---
Also I'm just going to take your condescending tone as a reflex on you name dropping and appealing to authority yourself, only to realise I have individually discussed it with those you mention only tell you, you are misrepresenting their views on the game.
---
&gt;It took until after LS2 and the game clearly demonstrating that content wouldn't be cast aside before I contemplated coming back seriously.
---
It was an easier jump for me as with no sub fee and not playing any other MMOs, the only other draw on my time was TF2/Dota 2. Even during LS1 I'd at least log in to check out what they'd put out, only to close the game soon afterwards.
---
I was very surprised at the time that LS2 actually presented a fairly solid experience for a change.
---
That's one of the saving graces of GW2 to my mind, the no-obligation nature of the game and the resulting ability to just load up and check out new content.
---
You can also use the steam controller on your phone. It can connect via Bluetooth and since it is the same account as your Steam Link, you can use the same control scheme!
---
&gt; as they fell into the bigger badder boss syndrome.
---
OMG this. I've been saying for years that GW2 just doesn't create encounters for its own combat system. It's why we even have the defiance bar in the first place, because we have to protect the One Big Bad from getting CC'd into oblivion. Most bosses hardly have any adds or movement, and their biggest threats come from large AoEs and/or one-hit KOs instead of anything interesting.
---
Pretty sure they didn't promote it because of the acronym..
---
I thought this was sarcasm because people have been calling condi fire Weaver cancer in PvP :P not sure how the most recent changes affect PvP but the class feels strong for once
---
I wouldn't call it a good spot TBH. Due to buffs in core specs instead of to specific weaver/tempest traits or skills, it's overshadowing all other professions with much higher DPS and a simplified rotation compared to pre-patch (using less elements and skills), plus condi ele builds outdoing power in both sustained and burst damage now.
---
Real talk: This is one of the two biggest reasons I dropped GW2 for FFXIV. I'm sorry but there's nothing as satisfying in GW2 as BLM anymore. Power staff ele was the closest you could get.
---
&gt; PoF ones can all be soloed, every single one, easily
---
Tell that to the fire mage dude in Riverlands
---
I love posts like this, thank you for sparking my interest in a completely new class/spec/playstyle!! 😁  
---
could you link any build or info you have for dagger mainhand condi weaver? I've checked metabattle and SC sites but haven't located anything good.
---
&gt; they are probably heavily copyrighted
---
I mean... that's a lizardy Pegasus.
---
I'm personally super happy campfire staff is gone. It had an extremely boring rotaiton and as long as it stayed as brokenly OP as it was, no other DPS option would ever be considered.
---
I mean, it could convert condis into boons on boon heavy fights like Mathias, Sloth, and Soulless Horror. Although the idea of teammates being required to be condi bombed to actually be affective is pretty silly in PVE fights.
---
That's just so wrong. There is a good condi and a good power build for every class
---
When I started I got character slots and 3 outfits, tbh except for maybe one outfit that I use on my Charr I regret buying them, since matching in game armor is more fun and give more interesting look for me.   
---
The other big purchase where getting expansions and missing episodes of living world I missed out.  
---
That's about it, for a very long time I haven't bought anything until mount skins came, then I invested in a few I liked the most and that's about it, had few hair change vouchers purchased and inventory slot.  
---
I try if i spend anything at all, buying something useful which I can't get in game.
---
Good to know!
---
I really don't see how build templates are going to draw in many of any old players that weren't already planning to come back.
---
Well It can always be implemented in story. its easy to provide mounts for anyone on a story missions. or the " Rent-a-mount" options for any player in the area if for a specific meta. The technology IS there( even the flying on a griffon like on the volcano instance of the Asura lab on sanswept isles) its a matter of will it fiit the narrative, more like it.
---
Holo rifle for pvp, condition renegade for pve
---
Who is to say? I'll say it. 
---
If you play an mmo like a single player RPGs you're literally doing it wrong and I dont care if anyone disagrees because they are wrong too.
---
&gt;Ok firstly, you appealed to authority first, don't move the goal posts now when you no longer feel like you have the upper hand. If the opinions of Jebro and ROM are irrelevant then so is this JackDaniels guy. 
---
I did not appeal to authority at all, I simply used streamers that are identifiable as examples, as opposed to saying my buddy Steve thinks x.
---
Let's break this down for you, you claimed "The only people I have met who say ESO combat is the best are people who havent played GW2.", so I pointed to a streamer (Jack Daniels) who I know has played both and prefers ESO combat as an example of someone who does not think that.
---
I didn't make any claims about his "high level understanding" or anything else, there was no appeal to authority.
---
Same with ROM, I just used him as an example of someone who you might have known of in GW2 as someone who stated on his stream that he thinks the combat has got worse.
---
It is only you who started banging on about Jebro's "understanding" of high level play, LOL. 
---
&gt; Secondly, a large part of your reply is irrelevant, because I only ever stated MMO specifically and we are talking about MMOs. Not shooters. Not fighting games. 
---
No it is not irrelevant, because it is putting your delusional views on GW2 as a skilled combat system into place in the grand scheme of things.
---
&gt;  Whether MMOs should be your go to for PvP? Now that is the most subjective thing in this entire discussion.
---
I'd say the numbers speak for themselves, PvP in MMORPGs, even by the low standards of the MMORPG genre is a dismal failure, meanwhile tens of millons play actual PvP games.
---
 &gt; all of which you have just said you disagree due to player experience, and not combat systems...
---
Wrong.
---
&gt; Also I'm just going to take your condescending tone as a reflex on you name dropping and appealing to authority yourself, only to realise I have individually discussed it with those you mention only tell you, you are misrepresenting their views on the game.
---
I haven't misrepresented anyone's views on the game and again the only laughable appeals to "authority" have come from you.
---
&gt; If you fail to reply with legitimate points or try to appeal to authority again, I just won't bother replying.
---
That is no loss.
---
I always considered it undead, but I think your description might be closer. But anyway the concept aside the idea of a creature called a thestral seems to be a uniquely Harry Potter based one.
---
I would play it simple, go d/p for decent enough dmg and cleave, shadowstep, aoe blind and a daze. Use shortbow on swap for aoe or event tag. D/p will also give u on demand stealth.
---
Cant go wrong there.
---
it worked. thanks!
---
worked. thank you!
---
Same. I can only try to force GW2 into my preferred playstyle for so long. I like a lot of things about GW2 besides the combat, but combat is kinda important... I don't want to be pigeonholed into standing in a melee blob hitting stuff with a sword like every class feels in GW2 now.
---
Death. Good.
---
The second edition was covered but barely, they only donated a few gems. No promotion nor anything.
---
Ive seen Anet do things i would have never, nor any of us for the matter, have thought possible. Even if they said they wouldnt, they reopen such discussions overtime. Over 14 years of playing the series...they have done amazing things. have a little faith :)
---
Expacs also require money and a lot of man power, far more than a living update, they also carry much greater risk. They can be a complete shit show in reception, as we saw with WoW's Battle for The Alliance, or they can be a golden child and be the second coming of MMO Jesus in reception as we saw with FFXIV's Shadowbringers. It's possible that Anet just doesn't see the risk as worth it financially right now when weighed against the costs.
---
Obviously there's the third option, where the community is okay with the expansion and just.....well they like it enough, but that's not really what you want for an MMO.
---
Another PSA: Scourge can do the elevator to the JP aswell!
---
It’s not hard, it just has a mechanic that’s hard to see and few people know how to use breakbars. The fire mage guy is a similar difficulty to the obnoxious knockdown branded guy at the top of that tower imo. Requires you to watch animations and dodge at the right times.
---
Taimi tought me that during War Eternal.
---
It's pretty much in line with most builds now at around 30k.
---
I’m thinking you meant this for a different thread?
---
https://imgur.com/8XGDD9S
---
What support? All it does is provide crappy heals. No boons, no barrier, no burst heals, no condi cleanse.
---
&gt;Anet milking GW2 players while keeping it on life support with a skeleton crew to fund other projects is nothing arbitrary, it's a fact.
---
*citation needed*
---
&gt;The game might not be dying, but the community is.
---
***
---
There is a difference between what you *feel* and what is fact. Pushing forth an unsubstantiated claim as fact is, well, just bullshit justifying bullshit.
---
also the statement about NCSoft stepping in is also obfuscated. GW2 was still coasting along, but NCSoft for one reason or another forced Anet's hand to drop other projects and dump back into this one game. That's not really a good sign for a studio's future. They need to be able to branch out and develop new games / new IPs to survive for the long term. GW2 is almost a decade old. It doesn't mean the death/life of GW2, though. It could be a good or bad thing, we just don't know enough information.
---
But if they would want to adjust condi weaver specifically then why would they do this by buffing core ele, it doesnt make any sensr
---
No, the rest of the Ele builds should come waaaaay down. 30k is definitely not really low at all. Just look at the current benchmarks for anything but other Ele builds and power Chrono.
---
Most other professions have 30-33k DPS builds.  The only outliers right now are the ridiculously broken mirage, and these insanely overtuned Ele builds (and power Chrono but that remains to be seen) that are most likely gonna get a blanket nerf. Staff core with such an easy rotation should be closer to 27k or something, so the actually engaging staff builds can be closer to 30k.
---
Depends on how much gold you have ;)
---
Executioner Scythe doesn't have a daze, but a [unique effect](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reaper%27s_Frost) that functions the same as stun.
---
Uhhh, it's definitely not.
---
More accurately, it gives [Reaper's Frost](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reaper%27s_Frost), though the functionality is the same as stun.
---
(Part of my ocd that demands creating as few duplicate or near-duplicate things has me baffled why they didn't just use the [Freeze](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Freeze) effect for the two cases Reaper's Frost is used...)
---
Don't worry about it. It's content. :^)
---
Snowcrows.com is a great place to start.  They have some good break downs and keep it updated relatively close to patch days.  Granted, the rotations you will see will be primarily just for golem usage, but it will help give you a good idea of where to start.  cWeaver will have a lot to learn with how everything synchronizes in it's skills and traits, but once you get more familiar, it becomes a giant toy box of options.
---
On a semi-related note, can anyone tell whether the Tiger Cub clips with Wayfarer's Henge on slyvari?
---
Update: 
---
I ran CMs as DPS last night (for the 1st time in forever).
---
The other dps was an (actually competent) DH too.  
---
Got outdpsed by 3-5k in pretty much every fight. (Still over 2x the ren, thank god).
---
No one cared... CMs+T4s+Recs in 58 min 30 seca... Not that bad!
---
ANet angrily at druid: you can't be a healer and do anything other than feather touches levels of DPS!
---
Turns at scrapper: you _should_ be a DPS dependent tank!
---
It's just.... confusing :)
---
The old condi tempest was that way with only using fire.  There is also a condi might tempest build now that is useful, and only uses fire and earth.
---
Lies. Skyscale fuel can't melt steel gates.
---
Chronomancer got hit super hard in competitive modes, and Holosmith lost some damage in PvE, while still being virtually untouched in other areas.
---
Chrono definitely is struggling more.
---
The topic title company specifies PvE.
---
Afaik (IE according to dT and snowcrows)most warriors in PvE are core or berserker.
---
&gt;Tell me more about Power Revenant please, I'd like to know.
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Revenant_-_Power_Sword
---
&gt;Also Condi Elementalist!
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Tempest_-_Meta_Event_Boon_Support_DPS
---
You're welcome dickhead!
---
Same. I just refuse to play chrono since december patch. Instead I've learned a bunch of other support builds, but still a lot of groups look for an off chrono, where hybrid comp works perfectly fine.
---
As someone who plays solo most of the time, I can say you're off the mark as well. I like to do whatever I want without committing X hours at a time because of people waiting on me. I like being able to explore at my own pace, grind at my own pace, and just have an authentic experience. Add the fact that GW2 doesn't inherently promote guilds beyond some extra stat bonuses and chat channels, and you have less reason to convince a player like me to play with others. Most of the time, PUG is all someone needs, and works well with my laid back approach
---
I am engaged all day, this is perfect for becoming non-engaged.  So yes totally fun and relaxing.
---
When was the last time ANet charged the players for a patch?
---
Also I know how much I am paying for entertainment each month because I am choosing to buy things. I'd rather retain that discretion than buy a subscription where I'm paying for access whether I use it or not.
---
Also what sort of "pay for a solution to a problem the developers make themselves" are you facing in gw2 that would be eliminated through the implementation of a fee?
---
And sure they'd probably have a lot more money if everyone playing the game now was throwing in $15/mo. But two big, huge, game changing issues to consider: first, would that money even be used in ways that would please everyone? Or are you just assuming that it'd go toward changes that you yourself would like? How likely is it that 10 of every 15 would go to NCSoft shareholders and executives and the game would see little change?  And second, that hypothetical is unrealistic anyway because you'd have to account for the not-insignificant portion of the player base that would drop off and the near-zero number of new players such a change would draw in.
---
Basically, cash shop or sub fee, you're making the wager that missing out on other sources of revenue to target a certain demographic will pay off. By their decision to target whales and attract MMO casuals they have their current model. Switching to a sub would push away most of that core and attempt to draw off loyal players of other MMOs who are already being catered to. Ultimately I think that a switch like that would utterly ruin GW2 and by extension, ANet as a whole.
---
They target a niche that as it stands, they're the only major game to target: full featured, no-subscription fee, pay once, non-P2W, premium MMO.
---
For dealing with boss mechanics, typically you will use water and air outside of Weave Self.  Water is always there as a fast and reliable (nope) out of an attack when endurance is low.  Air is good to transition through during CC phases.  For bosses like Samarog with lots of CC phases, you will need to hit both air and water back and forth to maximize your CC output.
---
My Soulbeast (ranger path of fire spec) gets a hefty use out of GS and I find the ranger GS to be the most fun to use. Murdering things with a spirit bear is so much fun! It's a mobile weapon, the 3 bird skill moves you forward and you dont need a target to use it.
---
https://youtu.be/6q3em9s5I4c
---
This is again painfully true.
---
But does is it on the same level as other classes? I dont think so. The only reason to use Tempest instead of Weaver are the overloads and the shouts, but neither of them are great. It seems much better to use Weaver. And what about Condi Mirage, for example? It seems way better. I really enjoy playing Tempest, but it always seems that it doesnt pay off.
---
I'm well aware, I've done my share of commanding and I've never played with a static save for being a temp backup for a few weeks for a dhuum cm group that went nowhere. I pug every week. As far as I can tell there's been a recent uptick with the advent of wing 7 but aside from that it's been a steady decline. Just calling it how I see it. I spend most of my time with the raid lfg panel open if I'm still missing any PoF wing. 
---
I will say there's been a lot of wing 5 groups recently, which is nice. only seen one dhuum cm group this month, though.
---
I think scaling rewards is a decent idea, yea. That way people are encouraged to group up, yet aren't unable to do the content without doing so. The one thing I could see becoming problematic is it might start a culture of zergs being mad at solo players for completing events before the zerg gets there - an issue that already does exist in certain "farm" maps.
---
If that can be avoided somehow, I like the concept.
---
There are more viable builds and party comps now than there ever has been in the history of this game.  People keep wanting to complain about one thing getting buffed, and something else getting nerfed, but that is exactly what a balance patch is.  And it's not like they're unplayable.  Chronos can spec into strong power dps that was and most likely is still the highest burst in the game.  Holo is also still playable and viable.  Just because something's dps drops a bit, doesn't mean it's removed from the game entirely.  Play whatever you want to play.
---
Nice do they also deal damage? Tell me more. Explain.
---
Is there any class that is tanky/healthy for solo'ing and good/decent in group content? I'm new, but after looking over the classes, I'm still kind of lost and what to play. I was thinking either Warrior for Spellbreaker, or Guardian. Being good in PvP is also a bonus. Any help appreciated.

---
&gt; The game is doing fine, people like to dramatise. I enjoy playing it whenever i can,
---
Stopped reading here. The game IS doing fine if you're a new or casual player. You're Anet's target audience. Not veterans or hardcore players.
---
Took longer to write this snarky comment then to google that
---
&gt;They will add them later
---
You comment implies certainty. While ANet adding them is certainly in the realm of possibility, since ANet has not explicitly stated they are going to do this and we have no compelling direct evidence indicating that they are going to do this specific thing, it's disingenuous to say that they will.
---
If you're trying to pug through something harder it's generally gonna be a rough time until meta strats and comps form up. There were similar complaints about W5 iirc. If you're convinced that there are less people raiding even after admitting you have no idea how many people there are actively raiding... Well, that's kind of an unsubstantiated claim, isn't it?
---
I am familiar with Warframe (to put it lightly). I don't really think the two are comparative because of scope of gameplay. For example, Warframe is a clusterfuck of bugs and imbalance (gameplay, combat, and economy) where the developers just keep throwing accretion on. 
---
GW2 is much more measured with the content they add and much more deliberate with things like balance. It's also worth mentioning that the scope of infrastructure behind the two games is vastly different and Digital Extremes still uses (effectively) P2P hosting as an alternate solution to servers hosting gameplay sessions in mission-based closed environments. Hell, most of Warframe's successes came from other games shitting the bed rather than DE doing big marketing pushes. Their first real advertising campaign was when Plains of Eidolon launched and now they're dumping money into the next announced "expansion" update. Kind of how like when Bless online flopped GW2 saw a bit of a spike, but Warframe's genre is a bit less saturated so when Destiny 2 had problems it played up big for Warframe.
---
I'm not trying to discount how you feel and what your perception is. What you feel and experience is definitely real to you. I just want to do what I can to curb people putting forth their feelings as facts when they either lack information or when they refuse to accept information.
---
I definitely agree that people shouldn't set high expectations for GW2. It's a fun and comfy game but if 7 years isn't enough time to convince someone that it's not striving to be a market dominating force then I don't know how else to convince them that Anet just never had an interest in that.
---
I didn't know you could do this, I need to check it out!
---
If all you do is open world, just camp it in whatever class you want. If the highest PvE is normal mode fractals, you’ll do ok camping it in reaper or dh. If you want to do raids or CM, there currently isn’t a spec that doesn’t include swap out of GS for a rotation. I guess you can still play those without swap, but you’d be hitting such low numbers that a good number of groups would just kick you as dps is supposed to well, bring dps.
---
It's certainly a big buff for pvp as well.
---
I bet they're gonna nerf it the moment I change stats on my gear
---
Picking a class overall would be very difficult for me.  
---
But damn, I LOVE me some [Deadeye](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vZAQNAU8an8MBNOhFOBWOBUGjFfCzrJsEiC8ryYZucLA8aCQA-e).  There is something SUPER satisfying about setting up a sniper position and blasting an enemy from super long range.  Even when not kneeling the rotation feels solid.  
---
I think a close second would be the [Holosmith](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vdAQJAsenUUBVIj1IDmIDcJjF2CrfNGHvjgjoTUA47Fkh2QA-e), specifically sword/shield.  I love the whole idea behind the heat mechanic.
---
Thief was in that state with rifle already.
---
Playing with pugs isnt playing single player. You arent what we're all talking about.
---
FA s/w tempest is very good now, especially in fractals.
---
&gt;benchmarks by themselves 
---
The "by themselves" bit was kind of important there.  I never said they were useless, just that they won't tell the full story.  Just like you said later in this comment, certain builds suck on certain fights.  If we only trusted benchmarks at face value, Condi Mirage has pretty much always been in the 20k-28k range on benchmarks, yet for a while it was one of the strongest options for a lot of encounters. 
---
My point regarding cWeaver specifically, is that while it was benching lower than a lot of other dps, it would consistently be at the top spot in a vast majority of raid bosses.  If it wasn't the top dps, it would be tied with or within 1-2k of any other option.  All of W1, Sloth/Matt, Xera, all of W4, SH, etc... it would consistently perform in the same dps range in every group.  Solid statics or pug groups, good and bad, it remained consistent with other logs, but not the benchmarks.  If we were to expect anet to nerf and buff classes solely by benchmarks, the game would be in a really bad spot.
---
&gt;Buff uptime can swing wildly and be inconsistent from fight to fight
---
&gt;rotational efficacy can't be controlled
---
It absolutely can be controlled.  Plan for the worst and assume you have no alacrity.  Adjust accordingly if you see the boon is there.  Quickness is basically handed out at this point, if you don't have it there are other problems to worry about.  But you can 100% make sure your rotation is efficient consistently for each encounter.  If your rotation isn't lining up with the encounter mechanics, it's the player, not the class/build.  Sometimes delaying the usage of important skills around mechanics will improve your dps significantly.  If you only know how to do the benchmark rotation for your class, rotation efficiency will definitely seem like it can't be controlled.
---
&gt;You take benchmarks within the context they're meant to be used for, nothing else, and they are incredibly reliable for BENCHMARKING where a class sits in terms of relative power.
---
The only thing benchmarking really does is establish the most efficient rotation possible with the peak *potential* of dps.  If you can only pull it off on a golem, however, it doesn't give you any real information on where the power level of a class stands in any encounter except MO.
---
&gt;Logs from actual fights are for personal improvement and evaluating a builds viability, not it's power level compared to other classes
---
And this I disagree with entirely.  Logs from actual fights are, again, the only reason something like Condi Mirage actually exists in the meta.  Logs from actual fights tell you the full story of exactly how well builds can perform on specific encounters.  That's not to say that every fight log will give you any valuable information.  Of course you still have to factor in variables and mistakes.  However, when you see a specific build performing consistently on multiple fights, it's worth looking into further.
---
Totally worth it imo 😂
---
I'm glad you learned something :D
---
Don't be so happy about it. You all forgot what happend when condi tempest became a thing 2 years ago. It also benched at 38k and shortly after, they nerfed it back into the dirt where it came from. In fact, this will happen to all of the builds that now do over 33k dps with this patch.
---
Highly agree. It's fun but can be countered if people aren't paying attention. Still, TONS of fun.
---
Yes there have been sales during previous anniversary events.
---
I get 120+ FPS in FFXIV with absolutely everything maxed at 1440p. 
---
GW2 comparatively even with d12x mods runs like shit.
---
Declaring a game dead before it's dead just creates a self-fulfilling prophecy where everyone stops playing because everyone keeps saying it's dead.
---
&gt;At that point your dps would be worse than holosmith's (which is quite low) while also having worse CC output.
---
Nope.  The bosses that you end up using water and air for the most also go invuln during their CC phases.  You can line your weave self up with CC phases for any boss so that going into water and air for the CCs is part of your dps rotation anyways.  Even if you have low CC in your party and have to go into them, the condis ticking will keep your dps from dipping much at all.  You never linger in any element, regardless of what you're in.
---
Ahah that's exactly how I see it 🤣🤣
---
I don't think that's true. It takes 5 seconds to buy an exotic weapon an the tp while you're there doing something else. "Most" seems like a assumed exaggeration.
---
Thank you to the people taking the time to offer legitimate responses. I’ll take your feedback moving forward. I appreciate the time and consideration.
---
Healing scrapper won't be removed from wvw because of this change, in fact the change barely affects it at all. The only one of the two traits that you mentioned you were taking on support scrapper in wvw should have been adaptive armor and even that was a toss up between adaptive armor and applied force. Scrappers condi cleansing, super speed uptime and healing with medkit are all still absolutely insane and way too strong so nothing will change regarding their viability in that particular game mode.
---
seems more malnourished than undead
---
&gt; I have a lot of regrets about Raid Finder for WoW. I am sure I worked on features that were much, much worse, but that's the first one that came to mind.  
---
To be clear, the goal of getting more players into raiding is a good one. But the way Raid Finder turned out removed, IMO anyway, a lot of the epicness of what made raiding raiding.  
---
^ what the dev said.  
---
&gt; What exactly it did, in my eyes, was that it removed the need for community for raiding  
---
&gt; the raid finder was just the icing on the cake that destroyed many smaller/mid sized guilds.  
---
also never forget that lfr in wow is so people can get easier gear to simply start raiding in higher tiers...not so people see the content. its a gateway into it. we have no gear gates in gw2.
---
It doesn't even do good damage, I was getting close to 20k DPS in testing (with a cleaner rotation I'd expect a little over 20k), but I'd have to drop even more to make room for blocking skills if I actually wanted to tank. No raid group is going to accept that loss for a crappy substitute tank.
---
The only skill on the entire bar (beside auto attacks) that isn't used is water 4.  Literally every other skill will be used.
---
I hope the second. I really like this game and I've recently came back and I'm having a blast with elementalist, but the lack of a future xpac would be the last nail in the coffin ⚰ for me
---
What are you on?  
---
Sure there were issues, but during season 1 people loved that shit. So many were glad for all the loot. People ran the crap out of that dungeon that eventually got cut up into fractals. People loved that there was all new events to do in the open world ever few weeks. And the Marionette fight was a defining moment for GW2 open world content. It earned so much praise from almost everyone at the time with how it made it feel like you could be a part of the giant group, but still make a meaningful contribution to the fight.  
---
That fight and its success became a model for all the meta events and bosses throughout the HoT maps. That fight is WHY there are 5 bosses in Verdant Brink spawning at the same time, why silverwastes has 3 lanes, why tangled depths has 4 lanes, why auric basin has 4 octovines and so on.  
---
Sure later seasons have been better but largely due to the success, experimentation, and what ANet learned from what shortcomings season 1 had.
---
Definitely not the spec to want to 1v1 with, it can work if you have to but it's much more fun to use in groups and just melt zergs.
---
Amusingly, I've played against your group a few times as we've been matched up and I'm just the guy on the opposite side doing the same thing from a small guild group.
---
It's that little icon, you just end up learning them
---
WAR (BP version) and SM
---
To sum up what you said:  
---
"I didn't like it, and therefor no one else did either"
---
They can do that for you, but when you are pugging raids, it's best not to trust pugs entirely.  It's not much of a dps loss overall, and compared to wiping an encounter because you refused to swap attunements to provide the CC it has available... well... I'd rather take a short dps loss that is easily recoverable.
---
Or, you know, right click the ability so it autocasts?
---
I feel really bad for all the pvp/wvw chronos, but...
---
Fractal Chrono has already been pretty terrible for a while now though, so the only game-mode I really care about Chrono now is Raids. And... it's same old, same old. Losing distortion is fairly obnoxious for clutch saves on some bosses(Shake on Sloth, easy access aegis elsewhere) but now I often just save a signet for situations where Aegis is required.
---
Really though, this is just another example of making a fairly interesting and neat class less fun for people to play. If you don't care about anything but boons on chrono, then nothing has changed. But trying to do anything other than that is getting more and more annoying with every balance patch. 
---
Something like firebrand is so much more interesting for me to play now because of all the clutch things you can do outside of being a boon bot. Power/Condi Signet share, 10 man stability on Cairn, Sam, ect, ridiculous levels of aegis uptime, resistance pulsing, and condi to boon conversion, ridiculous levels of reflect if you trait for it, ect.
---
Chrono will still be fine, but the more and more annoying you make it to play, the more skilled Chronos will not want to play it.
---
Haha, that's awesome. Who you play for?
---
Do you really believe a GS engi spec won't be camping bomb kit
---
Oh ok, well disregard that then lel
---
There are only 1031 people with a higher material storage value than me in gw2efficiency.
---
You are looking for excuses. I am just saying that it's possible that customers are growing or just remaining static. We don't know, only A/Net does.
---
[Knight of the Thorn](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Knight_of_the_Thorn) was far more praised than any of the Dragon's Watch shenanigans.
---
There's better stories out there.
---
Wait, it HAD build diversity? :o
---
And the world and content themselves are even more shallow.
---
Feef Is now gangsta wizard.
---
1) any class is good enough, all of them can be a support / power damage / condi damage role later on and have enough skills to be sufficient in solo play. race doesn't matter at all.  
---
2) the base game has only restrictions on certain items and chat. leveling in the game is easy since you always get experience scaled to your level...means even if you run arround as level 50 on a level 20 map, you will be downscaled in level but still get as much experience you would get in a level 50 map. leveling is really fast.  
---
3) do not focus on crafting at all at the start of the game. you just blow more gold out and getting stuff later on from the trading post or dungeons is cheaper and faster.  
---
4) certain low level items like t4 leather for example are more expensive since they drop less once you reach level 80 so they are less common...this way you already gather a fair bit of gold while leveling...but there is no real dedicated farm to actually grind something out. dungeons can help tho if you find people willing to carry you a bit through. apart from storys most explorable dungeons paths have a lower level requirement but they were intended for lervel 80's when the game came out. most people do not care anymore tho and gladly take people in without them being level 80.
---
We play the story instances because that's what's we get. But if next year we get a "Dragon's Watch died on the way back to their home planet" and we get some well-designed dungeons, quests or other content made by the freed-up resources, I wouldn't shed a single tear.
---
If you actually read the whole sentence you would realise that he made it very clear that the sentence was about PoF.
---
Yeah Staff 5 + Special Action Key is so broken on 100CM.
---
I've been liking the sword/focus for the longest time, but they all have purposes.  Dagger main seems to be the stonger option bit a little bit.  Dagger offhand provides more mobility than focus, but loses some of the survivability as a trade-off.  Staff is there for memes really.
---
FB tanking is actually surprisingly ineffective in most situations. If you go full Minstrel's you can facetank everything, but as far as damage mitigation is concerned with glassy tank builds Aegis is surprisingly ineffective.
---
VG: Green circle damage can only be invulned, not blocked.
---
Xera: Confounding Frenzy is multiple hits. Aegis only blocks one.
---
Deimos: Prides and Greeds can detonate to strip your Aegis right before either Mind Crush or a pizza slam.
---
SH: Applies damaging condis even if you block attacks. (Not actually sure what's happening here as I haven't tanked it much on FB, but the one-off Aegis blocks don't help as much as you'd think.)
---
Twins: Hard to fit into the comp due to needing either mirror comp or portals.
---
Qadim: Hydra, the only hard part, hits *twice* with basic attacks. You can block one of them.
---
Adina: Works great but Boon Thief is easily best in slot for tanking.
---
Despite "having lots of blocks", Firebrand has a suspicious lack of *sustained* blocks. Your only real option is Shelter, but this requires you to give up your healing mantra which is a huge part of your team utility. You need stuff like Mesmer Sword 2, Shield 4, distorts, etc. in order to effectively mitigate important damage on most fights because they last for more than one hit.
---
People say it because many game modes are, in fact, dead.
---
To me fresh air Tempest is too easy to really be fun. It doesn't feel like Ele anymore. But keeping Ele complexity intact and letting me completely focus on fire would be appealing to me as well.
---
&gt; They wanted to make Scrapper a better tank.
---
That's not what they said.
---
&gt; These changes aim to refocus the scrapper as a tank-like character that utilizes personal barrier applications to stay in a fight. [Lists a number of changes focused around making scappers more dependent on personal barrier.] Beyond focusing scrappers more clearly around their personal barrier application, ...
---
Nothing in that list suggests they wanted to the scapper to be purely better at tanking, rather, everything is about *how* tanking should work for a scrapper, and taking away vitality is exactly in line with their objective. One could argue that the objective is horrible, but the reasoning behind the change is in-line with the stated objective.
---
I'm planning to do is like this:
---
http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQNArdRnkICVdidDBmDBEEhl6BzqDEvSUyzv63A8KAkCiBA-jBCBQBA4UAIJlgU8JAwv9H6iSIvo8JP6Dyk6PkCocZaA-e
---
100% precision and full uptime of protection. Most of the damage will come from Spear of Justice/Big Game Hunter trait combo. Would you mind rating it for solo roaming open world.
---
You won't be using the entirety of water and air, except for a single skill during weave self in both. Anything else is a waste. If you're still fine with using it despite it being a waste, you could argue that every single Ele build uses all 4 elements.
---
It really doesn't. There are definitely mobs guarding chests and gathering nodes and stuff. Of course I just used stealth on my thief to bypass those mobs anyway but I very clearly remember it in Jahai Bluffs when following tekkits node farming route before learning you can quickly farm one of the hearts on alts for the currency.
---
So I’m a long time scrapper player, Iv told my story about how Iv been playing scrapper competitively LONG before the gyro buffs/reworks. Even back then, scrapper had a few fun builds, although nothing meta, you could bunker, power dps and condi dps. 
---
After the previous rework, the 5% damage with barrier, and the 10% from kinetic stab, made a power scrapper viable. Now, I do agree, the more recent bunker scrapper was a brain dead fotm build thats bunkering ability was overtuned, and playing against full bunker scrappers in pvp and wvw was objectively less fun. I definitely think bunker scrapper needed to be toned down. The three biggest offenders were adaptive armor, rapid regen and bulwark gyro. These could have had some minor adjustments to lower scrappers bunker ability, make everyone less annoyed and still leave power/condi in a good place.
---
As it stands now, power scrapper (full zerk, leadership runes) does LESS damage than before, and this is swapping all gear and trinkets to berserkers, as opposed to before when I ran a few pieces of commanders. The kicker here is that the barrier on hit isn’t consistent enough. There are SO many skills, traits, evades, blocks and invulns, glancing blows, and retal, that basically nullifies the barrier on hit trait, and makes the -3k hp feel even worse. 
---
I’m not going to say I know how to fix it, beyond reverting most of the changes from the patch, but there must be a change in the works for scrapper, the barrier is too inconsistent, the damage is poor and the class is having an identity crisis.
---
Aww, my alt weaver is already sword focus :)
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...
---
Buut due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week).

Funny cause i remember preordering  and playing through the beta and stress tests, maybe you "hardcore veterans" players need to get out more.
---
if you take the raids and divide by the number of days between wing 1 launch and wing 7 launch, its actually closer to 2 raids per year than 1
---
Your anecdotal experiences are great and all, but we have tools nowadays to objectively measure performance, and it doesn't look good for GW2.
---
 Heya!
---
I wanted to know which class would be the easiest to pick up after boosting it? I feel bad for not leveling fast enough to participate with my guild and I was planning on boosting a class anyhow. I'm interested in playing just about anything. Coming from other mmorpgs (WoW, FFXIV), I'd like to say I want to tank/heal, but I know here it's totally different. I will look into every opinion or preference posted under this. I really appreciate any answers that come my way.

There are new players coming into GW1 who are anjoying themselves, and that game has been on maintenance mode for 7 years so what's your point?
---
This game *is* dying. Whether you choose to live in denial or not is up to you. Intsead of circlejerking about how it's not dying until servers shut down, I'd prefer if we could have healthy discussion about what could be done to save it. Unfortunately most of the GW2 sub is in denial and downvotes any threads that even hint at the game not doing perfectly fine.
---
&gt; I miss pre-HoT campfire staff, honestly.
---
Same. Ele used to be so awesome years ago, and people bitched about ice bow being too OP yet don't seem to have much of a problem with breakbars!
---
Now look at it. It's so unappealing to me and one of the few classes that doesn't resemble its former self in the slightest bit.
---
The wiki has good [resources on it all](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Profession#Compact_profession_icon_table).
---
Daaaw I forgot one.
---
1 of the 2 bots is actually a shy player that likes to pvp but gets killed when typing back...
---
So, did you even read?
---
Exactly. With limited info you can't create arguments like "game is fine" or "playerbase is growing". My goal was to prove the data provided means nothing without context and conclusions drawn in this thread are nothing more but speculation and manipulation of sort.
---
&gt; even if you run arround as level 50 on a level 20 map, you will be downscaled in level but still get as much experience you would get in a level 50 map. 
---
Almost, there is a scaling factor for when the difference in levels are large enough, so you would be getting some value less than 100% of the total possible experience, and would end up being something like 75% of the experience you'd get in a level appropriate map
---
It was literally this too when it got nerfed before they definitively trashed weaver. It wasn't at the top of the benchmark for once in years and people were absolutely mad making posts about it here
---
I can assure you that the percentage of people (solo or otherwise) who give even the slightest amount of fuck about gw2's official forums is probably not as high as you think.
---
Click on a commander and ctrl+T to call target on them. Other than that, you just need to work on your awareness. Being on discord/ts and listening to the calls is also quite important.
---
I've seen people target their tag so that there's a red circle above their head.
---
Try not to tunnel vision too hard.
---
Get into comms with them so that you hear their callouts and move when they move.
---
I target them with Control+T and use that to keep them in-view. After a while if you're on voice chat with them you'll be able to anticipate their movements from their calls and you'll find your survivability and general contribution much greater as a result. By the way, if you're not on voice chat with them (and they use voice chat at all) then you should be; it'll help a lot!
---
If you aren't doing it already, you can zoom in your minimap and reference that for relative position of the tag.
---
I find it helpful, but it does force you to take your eyes off the fight for a split second.
---
Listen to what the com says in teamspeak/discord
---
&gt; But hey Elementalist and Thief are looking pretty nice I guess!
---
I agree with your frustration but don't shift the blame on those professions, they've been hit the hardest too lately
---
If there's any world boss that needs a re-work.  This is it.
---
Warr, necro and ranger are usually labeled as easiest and most forgiving.
---
It would *cost* them money to retroactively add that feature
---
Well I hope they make it worth it. If they design a new weapon and engis end up in kits again that would be a waste.
---
[removed]
---
Apart from raids, do try to find out how much its needed in pvp and wvw  now.
---
Jesus christ
---
more like 2% missing.  
---
&gt; For example, a level 50 character completing a level 25 event will receive 52500 * .07 * .75 = 2757 XP. This does mean a high level character will receive more experience for the same content as a low-level character, but the percentage of a level gained is higher for the lower level character. For example, a level 25 character completing the same event will receive 14100 * .07 = 987 XP. While this is almost one third that of the level 50 character, it is 7% towards the next level compared to the 5.25% the level 50 receives.
---
Yes, that should be perfectly fine. Canada and the US are both part of the same megaserver, NA
---
By focusing entirely on monetization makes wonders short-term when it comes to profits, but long-term wise if the game will keep lacking new proper gameplay content, the game profits will do a big dive. 
---
If they really work on something big, they should communicate with players about that and clearly state that it will be worth the wait, but at the moment there is huge uncertainty about the game future and if they even plan to do something big (engine transition/remake/upgrade, new big expansion, you name it), or just do some kind of semi-maintenance mode or simply try to get as much money out of whales as they can and then abandon ship. Right now more likely it's the latter. Unfortunately. For a longer while I can't bring myself to play the game longer than just few hours or days and then abandon and forget about it for the next half a year considering the game nearly don't change at all throughout that time and a few hours is more than enough to spend quality time with the game as right after that it's absolutely disgusting time-sink shit you can only do.
---
And still even veteran Igobas and Jacarandas are very easy to kill. 
---
And the bunch you talk about can be easily avoided by just running away. It's not like they are everywhere, you bunch is very limited. You can easily runn in one direction and only have to fight agains 2 maybe 3 of them. And find a place full of Jacaranda AND Iboga (so you have to fight against both together) is even rarer.
---
This is amazing, thank you!
---
DPS dead? Everyone still wants one.
---
how would you add new skills to Revenant though?
---
Just a little side track; appart from elder wood, lower tier mats is where the most gold lies if you gonna go that way for some gold.
---
It's dead in the minds of special people that can only cry, complain, and downvote in the hopes of it makes them correct.
---
Oh, look.
---
Chronos driving
---
I'm not saying you're wrong or deserve downvotes necessarily, as both don't get weapon swap so technically you camp the one weapon, however ele frequently has conjures as part of it's rotation.
---
That said I DO hope we still get new weapons in the future, and either Ele or Rev getting GS would be damn awesome
---
Not a programmer but I think your object just called itself and you're in stack overflow
---
U got the build somewhere cus I wanna play this
---
Obviously all those people are necrophiliacs
---
I tried playing it lol. I really did! But just feels so weak now that you can't go for it when you have other options available.  
---
Any class with decent cleave damage like guard, warrior etc wouldn't kill the clones soon in pvp and the reliance of shattering only when you have clones up just doesn't make it. WvW zerg chrono was more or less already dead. This patch may just be the last straw.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_updates/2015-06-23#Skills_4
---
&gt;Using any shatter skill now creates the shatter effect on you as well by default.
---
Never forget. Something that was made baseline and removed from traits because it was bad got introduced back to same class as "tradeoff".
---
I disagree. I’v been playing zerker scrapper with divinity runes in pvp, bouncing around low plat, and can easily go 3:1 kda. It’s less about how it handles nodes, and more about how it 1v1s. 
---
https://youtu.be/uXtSYA3StZQ
---
I’m the asura with aurora/vision and white hair calling targets, this is a 4v6 + camp guards. Notice my health doesn’t go down?  It’s great sustain in big groups where you have lots of cleave. 
---
It falls flat when you go toe to toe with a warrior who’s got double your hp double your toughness and can hit for 12k easily, or a necro that just needs to load you with condi’s which can two tick you, unless you pop elixer s.

My anecdotal experience was an example of how you can run this game with basic hardware. We actually don't have tools to objectively measure performance accurately. There are vastly different workloads to take into consideration, to many dynamics. If you manage to build yourself a PC anno 2019 that can not run GW2 properly outside of extremely heavily crowded zones, then you can give youself a gold star. It's basically impossible.  
---
The vast majority of people complaining about ingame performance are those who question framerates dipping below 60 while having a 2080ti installed. In reality it is not that bad.
---
Skyscale. As an actual suggestion; I will now almost always mount the skyscale, fly up and hover in the air before ever opening my map to waypoint away. Alternatively, if you log out and back in, it takes you out of combat allowing you to quickly open your inventory and use a teleport scroll. Or sometimes it's convenient to just let yourself be killed to then allow for easy waypointing. Are any of those ideal, no it's terrible design but it's what we're stuck with. The real solution from Anet should be to allow players to /gg in the open world or simply allow us to waypoint while in combat.
---
maybe decrease their agro circle, but then increase the amounts of mobs...
---
i got the griffon and skyscale to avoid the mobs so theyre not really a problem for me now.

Mirage dps is controlled by torment and confusion procs so don’t get that confused

&gt;"Thank you Anet for making my main OP again and putting most other fun classes in the gutter!"

Not much better than the daily legendary post.

That helps a ton! Thank you :D

What am i missing if i do 15 K dps on fresh air tempest with food on the golem?

Farm gold

Humans. This is a fantasy game with many different races, and some powerful beings literally dump some plain humans on the planet randomly and they somehow turn into one of the most widespread races on Tyria? Absolutely typical and boring. The only thing I like about human lore is the gods actually existing.
---
Shoodoo is by Far my favorite craft I've done, Even if there arent much effects tied to it, especially as an Engineer, I just love having it on my back, that alone was worth the craft :D
---
&gt;There are tons of things the devs can't program because of the outdated engine!
---
Like what?  
---
 
---
&gt;And it's not only about "What can I come up with, that I would like to implement right now and need a newer engine for?"  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;It's about having the possibilities and capabilities to develop further and with more depth.
---
Like which possibilities or capabilities?   
---
&gt; And the question is: what for? 
---
Yes, innovative progression require ideas first. There's no point in upgrading a fully functioning system if it's delivering what is required. If requirements shift, that's when you start looking at an overhaul.  
---
&gt;  it's basically like the issue in League - where many bugs can't properly get fixed/many things can't get implemented properly because of the primitive coding they have used   
---
What is GW2 lacking right here and now that it needs huge time and money investment for to make it work?  
---
 What kind of 'non-argument' is it to say that the engine **isn't** fine because you can't think of anything that's missing/can't be done by said engine.
---
1. Race: doesn't matter, pick whatever looks cool. Class: Warrior and Necromancer are probably "easiest," but practically speaking you'll be able to manage just fine with whatever you want, so again, pick what looks cool (or most closely maps to what you enjoy in other MMOs).
---
2. Leveling is pretty quick in GW2 - you'll probably hit 10 within a couple hours, and 80 in anywhere from a week to about a month depending on how much you play. This can also be sped up with boosters, which are available through a variety of sources.
---
3. Crafting is only really important once you're at level 80, although if you're willing to put in the time it can give you a bit of a boost earlier on. Inventory management is dead easy: you have dedicated bank space for crafting materials and can deposit them from anywhere in the game. Just remember to keep some salvage kits on hand and break down any gear that you aren't going to (or can't) use, although I would personally recommend holding on to at least one of every weapon your class can use.
---
4. The easiest way by far for a new player to get gold is via Daily Achievements, the game gives you a selection at the start of the day and completing any three of them will net you 2 Gold, which isn't a fortune but will add up fairly quickly. You'll also get Writs of Experience in the process, which will help speed your leveling a bit if you're so inclined. You could probably make a reasonable amount of coin by selling the crafting materials you'll accumulate, but I'd hold on to those starting out.
---
And I can assure you that the demographics of players on reddit is drastically different than the official forum, and the official forum is a MUCH more accurate representation of the larger playerbase.
---
The thing is though XIV has the exact same problem as GW2.
---
All of the content it releases is mindless and repetitive. The dungeons are all cake walks that give outdated gear so you get a shiny new hallway with 3 target dummies.
---
The story mode raid is the standard, this is piss easy but one monkey will fuck it up so we wipe.
---
The trials sit as the only moderately challenging thing for the majority of the player base to do.
---
The 24 mans are a shiny set piece of piss easy unegaging content that only serves to catch you up to do the MSQ next patch.
---
Savage raiding is actual challenging content and well design yet released at a laughably glacial pace compared to its competition.
---
This is XIV and this has been XIV since 2.0. You can sit here and plan out every single piece of content that will come out in Shadowbringers and how hard it will be. The expansion has been laid out because they've done the same fucking thing 3 times already. 
---
The only reason XIV survives is because it's named Final Fantasy and has a story. The reason people are praising Shadowbringers and it blew up if you actually look at all the reviews and praise is its STORY. People are loving the world and the story. As an MMO is extremely average to subpar because it just like GW2 lacks anything meaingful to do that you havent done 20 times before.
---
May Chrono's reign be long and full of reworks.
---
Alright.... I'll bite 
---
:-D
---
Male Norns because their lower bodies ate just too skinny and don't match their physique.
---
Charr; they don't make good eating. Too gamey 😁
---
Almost leggy bow :)
---
They can work, but do know that roaming is very similar to pve open world when it comes to build crafting. Different people have different play styles so different stuff works for them, but you can also make almost anything work as well, especially if it's a ranged build with high burst.
---
Conquest builds are a good start, but you'll need to experiment a bit until you get something that's good enough for you. Wvw is also a lot more glass cannon friendly than pvp since you're not fighting around points, you have freedom of kiting and choosing terrain where you want to fight and classes you want to fight, especially with mounts.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Which sounds amazing on paper, but when every single class has access to prot, invulns, blocks and evades (plus a whole lot of other shit that reduces dps in a fight) the barrier you gain doesn’t make up for the loss of the hull integrity.
---
Watch out, we have a badass casual player here lowkey calling people no-lifers.
---
It’s been upgraded by now with Pharos. Azureflame is still an awesome bow though.
---
&gt; If the single dad wants to play  
---
a single dad has better shit to do than to play games.  
---
&gt; Instead you would get additional difficulties. More to do for veterans.  
---
no, anet is not gonna release more raids just because they make it for a broader audience, this is simply some assumption with no background. as if anets suddenly gonna shit out raids. how many challenge modes are in the story...very few...and they have this options since ages and do not plan for something like this to cather to the more hardcore crowd. same argument. look at dungeons and fractals. fractals are very much this and what do we have there? bad development after 99 and 100.  
---
&gt; You would deny people some light-hearted after-work fun because you disagree with their philosophy.  
---
i don't. i do the same in openworld after a long day. its just something which has no place in raids. raids are its own gamemode, not regular pve. wouldn't jump into pvp not expecting to get killed because "i just want to cap nodes, capping nodes is fun but killing not".  
---
&gt; You'll probably never realize how fucking disgusting that mindset is.  
---
is it? i tell you what really fucking disgusting is. "i want everything now without putting in any work". "what, i have to change my build for the team? never lmaoo bye you toxic people, expecting me to do something".  
---
that is disgusting. being a fucking special snowflake which gets their ass powdered by mom not standing up to anything. thats toxic and delusional.  
---
it is not my problem that you search salvation in some online game to feel special. as if every raider goes arround and says look at my shinies, i am raiding, so proud what you cannot do that, lmao what are you bad? thats something you always project onto us...and that is the only fucking toxic and disgusting thing here.  
---
simply stop being a shithead to other people which do not share your opinion.
---
Thanks so much!
---
You’re forgetting that you can’t use your shatter skills without having clones. This means that not only was F4(distortian) and F5 combined but they also require a clone. Maybe not that big a difference, but it’s not ”the exact same class” as you worded it.
---
1/100y.
---
without a doubt, power soulbeast is what you're looking for. 10000%. one of the few meta specs in fractals, insanely strong burst in open world, and _very_ mobile.
---
Be careful if you're in squad and you target, though, as everyone can see the target and you might take it away from an actual enemy the comm wants you to target. If you're in a subgroup within the squad, only those in your subgroup see the target so you could ask them if they're cool with it. 
---
You can ask the comm to put a marker on their head if you'd like. They tend to stick out and are more visible than commander tags imo. Worst cast scenario, follow the zerg. If your issue truly is getting distracted like you say, you need to address what's distracting you and fix that. 
---
But I definitely recommend being in voice too. So much easier to just follow heard commands of "go right, hug the wall" etc. than trying to see a little tag in an endless mass of aoe markings.
---
It is literally every game being neglected that is not open world and gemstore. How can you defend this?
---
Shatters have not a lot to do with you plopping down some wells and pressing SoI on CD. So, not whole lot harder, just cumbersome - especially every CS-related part, if you have that basic instinct of pressing CS somewhere near opening to dupe yourself SoI/time warp. But other than that, meh.   
---
WvW and PvP though, yea-a-ah. Yikes from me.
---
Zamasu, is that you?
---
Thems fighting words.
---
Maybe it's not a question of people wanting it, but a question of people willing to play it in its current state.
---
Not a fan of the Dredge. They have a rough history sure so one might empathize but they get really obnoxious at times and their whole “comrade” thing is a little off putting.
---
I would more so blame Anets neglect of WvW for the lack of growth.
---
I don't think some mean WvW players prevent it from growing, otherwise PvE would shrink too. Every game mode has dicks.
---
No it's not, the larger playerbase visits neither.
---
Forums and subreddits of mmos are and always have been angry people shouting at the sky. Regular people who enjoy the game don't give a fuck.
---
&gt; How should I spend my talent points?
---
The leveling experience in Gw2 is very forgiving, so all you need to do is play the game and read the tool tips to get a decent grasp on things. If you are unsure test out some things yourself and/or look it up on line most of the answers are out there already. You dont have to worry about min-maxing pre lvl 80, just focus on doing dmg and having a couple of skills you can use to help mitigate dmg, things like blinds, evades etc.
---
Condi Weaver was already good pre-patch, barely anyone used it. Two straight months of t4s/raids; a single other condi ele. And it was a tempest.
---
Shame that with it now being the new flavor of the month it'll get taken out back in a few months.
---
Absolutely! It's funny, when I first began my explorations of that map, I hated it and never wanted to attempt my dailies there. Now, I absolutely love it and would definitely welcome more maps like it.
---
You should have said this in the first post lol. Sorry but this sub is a hive mind and anything people don't like will be downvoted instead of actual replies.
---
Works with vpn, huh. Curious.
---
Yeah dunno why this is upvoted so much.
---
This is my own current scrapper build, meant for pve:
---
Firearms 3 3 2
---
Exploives 3 3 2
---
Scrapper 1 1 1
---
Running hammer (force/accuracy) with heal turret, bombs, bulwark, shredder, sneak gyros
---
Wearing full zerk/scholar.
---
Literally it is the snowcrows holo build (explosives 3 over 2 for solo fury uptime) but with scrapper instead of holo for 3rd trait.
---
Basically i spam the hammer skills as much as i can, then swap to bombs and pop bulwark and shredder together, and i go back to hammer when those gyros grant me superspeed. As long as im not *fucking* chilled/slowed, im almost unstoppable; my weak spot of course is cleansing conditions.
---
I am starting the process of making an ascended set of assassin/zealot with rune of the defender (5% heal every time you block, 1s cd, 175 toughness/100 heal power), would run accuracy/transference on the hammer. Overall the power and ferocity are significantly lower, so im worried about barrier generation there, but every 1% dps loss is only .15% barrier-per-second loss.
---
The tradeoff would be not having to use explosions to maintain fury uptime as id be sitting at around 74.9% crit chance excluding firearms, allowing me to run inventions 2-2-2 or 3-3-2 and swap bombs to the purge gyro for cleanse and get much higher survivability.
---
The compromise here would be staying in full zerk, using rune of the defender, and then running inventions 3-1-2 or 2-1-2 with rifle turret instead of bombs. Bad condi cleanse and much lower cc but fury would just barely stay up and overall dps would be much closer to a regular power scrapper.
---
When a pug maintains fury for me, i run the build listed at the top but swap explosives to inventions 2-3-2 and it makes it around 25% easier to tank things.
---
Oww, I know now what's wrong about the build I made. It's leaning towards DPS rather than survivability. Thanks for the feedback. It actually took me time to realize what is wrong.
---
I’ve raided with him before I wouldn’t want to again
---
"Since the very beginning, one thing that always disappointed me about Elementalist was the lack of usage of all the elements. For years, meta Ele has been swapping between Air and Fire."
---
Vs
---
" It had me on the cusp of giving up the dream of an Ele rotation that used everything on the bar. Then, after some balance patches post PoF, we were blessed with the Condi Weaver."
---
...Was what I'm talking about. It is kinda implying that the power mainly only rotate between air/fire while condi weaver uses all skills it has, even though it also only rotates between earth and fire for the most part.
---
It's strange that all I've heard for months was that ele is the weakest class, it's worthless, ect.     
---
Then it gets a little buff and someone says they are enjoying it and it turns into a big deal.    
---
It's the absolute hardest to play and squishiest class, shouldn't it have some good points?
---
The changes did not kill Healbot Scrapper in WvW Zerg Fights. It's still a cleanse machine and Sneak Gyro is still great for prolonging stealth on engages. The removal of the reveal is probably the biggest nerf that happened, but we'll have to see how the guilds adjust to that.
---
&gt; loss of the hull integrity
---
Just equip a Damage Control II and you'll be all set
---
It also removed the ability to do a zero-clone shatter to do a quick 5-target aoe attack with a low cooldown to tag stuff.
---
More like , empty
---
No. It isn't. I've tried this as a Deadeye might share healer with Shadow Arts in open world and raids.
---
In open world, the number of targets that die quickly allow for an easy 25 Might. In raids, you are reliant on either external SoI or Pack runes to maintain 25 Might with a Trickery/Shadow Arts/Deadeye build.
---
However what kills heal thief in any PvE content is that the scaling of the direct heal (shadow step) is far too low. You do about 1.6k per shadow step and this is both too slow and too little, even with sword main hand and Trickery for more initiative.
---
The heal overtime aspect, while nice in theory, doesn't work in PvE since people keep attacking. On top of that, you miss out on many defensive boons, flexible ranged heals, unique buffs and the healing output is far, far too low.
---
The changes feel far more like preparation for a support elite with actual healing modifiers and options like alacrity and quickness rather than something that is supposed to be used now.
---
Ugh I wish It was that easy. Atleast the superspeed helps with our transversals.
---
People seem to forget Anets original intention was that endgame was PvP/WvW and a competitive focus...
---
Somewhere along the road... We lost that.
---
&gt;I didn’t downvote anybody in this thread. 
---
Well it's a good thing I'm on a throwaway account where I can say whatever I want.
---
Trash dies before you can get off a good burst. Heck, it often evaporates before your berserkers stop spinning and turn to clones, so most often you can forget about pressing f1 at least for style points. Conclusion?   
---
Functional, but just not fun.  
---
Bosses in fractals already either phased or straight up dead before you could even finish first loop of power DPS rotation. Not to mention that DPS rotation itself suffered, because what chrono needed for personal DPS/5man is of course even more reliance on Slow. Do keep in mind, official benchmarks just cheerfully assumed permaslow for Danger Time before - especially for GS variants, see Xera meta squad - in 5 man (fractal, god forbid dungeons) - have fun reaching any uptime aside from your own time warp (for which FB/another chrono will hate you for overwriting their quickness stacks with your sissy 2sec ones), so it is implied that now you're somehow supposed to line up Time Sinks and Split Seconds. Except CDs a little backwards for that, too.  
---
I'm not even going to mention that fixing that issue by taking Lost Time is, ironically, a waste of time over Chronophantasma and a huge blow.   
---
In short, don't underestimate what Ill. Persona did to Chrono's attempts at being anything but a wellbot. Funnily enough, dominant wellbot role is mostly fine and dandy and majorly unaffected - because it's already snooze-inducing with it's choking requirement of 3 same utilities ever.
---
To clarify, it could *only* effect Jormag, wouldn't be any good against Kralky.
---
Scrapper cant be balanced to do dps comparable to holo or condi core engi.
---
Let's review: holo gets dps from photon forge, and from bombs/grenades/laser disk when out of forge. Well, scrapper doesnt gain access to the forge or the laser disk.
---
Core engi gets dps from conditions. Ignoring how hard it is for cDPS roles to feel valued and appreciated, let alone to find good bosses to fight, currently condition damage does not add barrier for scrapper.
---
Scrapper can do bombs and grenades like core engi, but a huge portion of that damage comes from those conditions you so desperately wish you could get barrier from. Plus using bombs and grenades doesn't let you bring bulwark *and* purge gyro. Basically it would be core engi with scrapper traited instead of, idk, tools is it? Idk what 3rd trait is meta for condi core engi.
---
The only other option is the hammer, as its attacks do more damage than the pistols and rifle, and generate blocks, interrupts, and direct barrier creation.
---
But youre still just swinging a hammer around. Your best hope is to try and do 4 bombs a second with alac and quickness while your shredder gyro is going, and it just isnt very good.
---
Well in the game you don't typically one-shot everything, so you're kinda left saying, "ok, that did nothing..."
---
The bug was on a power mod, condi is still benching 38k and upwards.
---
ok
---
From Roul's comment chain I understood you're trying to justify the unjustifiable as if in reality a condi DPS doing 38-39k DPS with the burst of a power class isn't super busted.
---
&gt; Why this third person nonsense?
---
Cause Kitty is full of itself and thinks Kitty will be famous streamer? 
---
Pulls the same stupid bullshit on the forums. And never heard of 'em till this patch.
---
Yeah, sums it up nicely
---
And if you wanna see the cooldown out of the trait menu?
---
Engi is pretty dead in PvE currently, I'm actually amazed on how things took a turn for the worst in a single patch.
---
Which is factually true. Bury your head in the sand all you want, but ArenaNet would not have abandoned the Living release model otherwise.
---
Just started playing with some friends and was wondering if there was content we could do together despite being fairly low lvl. Atm we are playing the starting zones together but being in a party brings little to no benefit from what I can see.
---
Also, how often are the expansions on sale? After a brief search I could see that the last time both expansions were on sale was on March.
---
I stopped playing last year because I loved unlocking new skills and theorycrafting but didn't like deadeye. Things got stale fast.
---
If it’s for tanking, chrono is still king.
---
The chrono changes really only affect it in PVP/WVW. WVW, by far the most impacted
---
What're you talking about? Jil Adren is a divine gift to NA raiders with his godly DPS and mastery of mechanics. Such titles, much wow. All bosses, all classes! Boom!

I have a special rune that beats the selling boss:

Minimap helps a lot to me personally. Just a quick glance lets me regroup with the tag more easily.

Reaper or Guardian is the correct answer. =)

Thanks,

I didn't crunch numbers but the kind of hybrids I was thinking of were between 2 of the stats, not necessarily celestial in particular.
---
Grieving w/ Condition Duration Runes/Sigils as an example, it would give a ton of defensive barrier to a glass build If it got barrier from both power &amp; condition damage dealt. And since engineers primarily have Bleeding and Burning as their conditions of choice, you could get a ton of barrier out of those :)

People who call businesses shady who provide a group of people with what they want are cynical, that doesn't make me naive.

I played Guild Wars 1 too, and you know, I played it pretty much exactly the same way that I play Guild Wars 2. There's virtually no difference. It's true that you can buy most rewards with gems turned to gold in this game, but if you think people didn't buy gold in Guild Wars 1, you're simply wrong. Plenty of people did. I wasn't one of them, nor do I buy gems in Guild Wars 2.
---
In Guild Wars 1, the vast bulk of the rewards could be bought with gold, including end game weapons from Domain of Anguish, which some hard core players got and sold in Kamadan. O they didn't sell the weapons directly, but there was a currency they sold where you could build them.  Most of the rewards in Guild Wars 1 weren't account bound. 
---
There was one guy in my guild who farmed feathers in a low level zone to get enough gold to buy pretty much any reward he wanted. Seemed all he did, ever was farm feathers. Other people had other farms, but many of those didn't take skill.  
---
More to the point, these rose colored glasses need to come off. If you were a PvE'er in Guild Wars 1, you had a build and a build of heroes through most of the life of the game that required virtually no effort from you at all. For many people Guild Wars 1 was a harder game, but for some people Guild Wars 2 is a much harder game because you can't take a bunch of heroes into dungeons, and win. You have to play with other people or learn how to solo them, and that's a pretty big change. You definitely have your rose-colored glasses on if you don't remember sabway or iway or lf r7 ursans, because 8 of them could beat anything with virutally no skill. You don't remember thieves who couldn't take damage that could tank, or gimmick builds like 55 monks, who could farm the area outside bergen hotsprings for decayed orr emblems with relatively little skill. You don't remember paragon/warriors that could mitigate 90% of the damage that were required in every team going into DOA.  
---
You dont' remember outfits being sold in the cash shop, or skill packs that you could buy so you could unlock skills on an account on all your heroes without capping them, particularly if you did Zaishen dailies and used the currency from them to buy tomes.
---
Sorry guy, but I play the game, I'm no gem store slave. There are people who farm this game for gold and pay nothing in the gem store too.  Those people are playing. And though I have spent money in the gem store, most of it isn't for skins. I mean I have a lot of character slots that I bought, just like Guild Wars 1.
---
In fact, when you compare Guild Wars 2's cash shop or business model to most MMOs out there, it's one of the least intrusive, most fair gem stores in existence, with the exception of subscription games.
---
You get games like SWToR with their "optional" subscription, WoW and FF XIV with their subs, but have you ever seen Lotro's cash shop? How about BDOs? I don't suppose you've played Blade and Soul?  We won't even talk about PWI games, or Maple Story type games, or Runes of Magic.
---
Honestly, if you don't think 1500 dynamic events is content, with the starting dungeons, Fractals soon after, the first Season of the Living World, I don't know what to tell you. Many of us do think it's content.  It's not YOUR content. 
---
And if they made a ton of the content you want, it wouldn't necessarily be content for the rest of us.
---
And just like you can pay people in this game to run raids for you, you could do the same with pretty much all the content in Guild Wars 1, from Drok's runs to dungeon runs.
---
PvPers are the ones who get teh short end of the stick, but even back in Guild Wars 1 days, PvP was the initial focus of the game and as time went on, PvP became less and less of hte focus. Anet was originally going to alternate expansions with one PvP focused one and one PvE focused one, but the last two that came out had no PvP at all. It just so happens that PvE players ended up to be more numerous and Anet didn't expect that.
---
What they did was open a business and follow the flow of traffic. When I ran my PC store, I didn't have a mac section or an amiga section, but I ended up getting both and as time went on, I got rid of the sections that weren't making me money... because that's good business.
---
If you want to work for rewards that's fine btw. Some people work for a living and want to come home and blow off steam and play a game, and not work for them. I'm not one of those people, though. I work all the time. 
---
But grinding is a form of work too and people did it in Guild Wars 1 just as they do it here. And then they bought the rewards from other players in Spamadan.  You're just not remembering, or you've not paid attention.
---
Were going to own Guild Wars 4
---
Yep. Anets been letting us down with their PvP balance and profession editing since before hot. Such a shame to waste the potential of such a fun mmo combat system.
---
To add to what ChmSteki said, I would agree that those 3 classes are indeed very easy to pick up. Necro and Ranger have the added benefit that (with one of their elite specializations) are often used as healers (Scourge and Druid respectively). 
---
I would also include the guardian is also a very easy role to pick up and is able to adapt to most game modes
---
&gt;What are you on?
---
I'm doing a drug called reality.
---
&gt;Sure there were issues, but during season 1 people loved that shit.
---
Demonstrably false.
---
&gt;So many were glad for all the loot. 
---
So what you're saying is, content can be complete garbage, but as long as the loot is good they'll lap it up? What a lovely indictment of the demographic.
---
&gt;People loved that there was all new events to do in the open world ever few weeks.
---
Content release cadence is a completely different topic to "living" releases. I don't think you'd find anyone that would disagree with more rapid releases, providing

&gt;And the Marionette fight was a defining moment for GW2 open world content. It earned so much praise from almost everyone at the time with how it made it feel like you could be a part of the giant group, but still make a meaningful contribution to the fight. 
---
And yet here we are, with the LS1 model in the garbage can.
---
&gt;That fight and its success became a model for all the meta events and bosses throughout the HoT maps. That fight is WHY there are 5 bosses in Verdant Brink spawning at the same time, why silverwastes has 3 lanes, why tangled depths has 4 lanes, why auric basin has 4 octovines and so on.
---
This is pure unadulterated fanwank. The Marionette didn't invent the concept of meta events, the groundwork already existed in Orr. It's an intrinsic part of the game's foundations, and one that would've been obvious had GW2 had more level 80 zones at or near launch.
---
&gt;Sure later seasons have been better but largely due to the success, experimentation, and what ANet learned from what shortcomings season 1 had.
---
"It's failiure made what came after better" Such a ringing endorsement of LS1, bravo.
---
How does it fare in PvP content?
---
You can go into your options menu and select to hide names above player heads. It helps reduce the visual clutter so the commander tag is more visible.
---
No point on this subreddit unless you want to get downvoted to hell.
---
&gt;The general release cadence would be totally fine if we had variable difficulty raids
---
\*gasp\*, you said the no-no!
---
The raid gatekeepers will be foaming at the mouth now!
---
And STILL no love for the engineer
---
Because people are snowflakes and raids are hot. If Anet should ban someone it should be people who buy raids because sellers are actually doing content, while buyers are the one afking.
---
Are the expansions really mandatory? I want to try the f2p part. 
---
Are there any group of people for the vanilla content? 
---
I want to play until i have time and money for the expansions :P
---
Sounds risky. I like it.
---
With the changes to chrono, is it still the best tank/support for pugs?
---
What classes should be played when your in a pug?
---
It was the fractals one, unless im mistaken Southsun cove was accessible through a boat at some point.
---
Feelsweirdman

Which can mean death ;-;
---
There seems to be some confusion about how stats work.
---
If you take Viper, you do *not* do as much direct damage as if you take Berserker.
---
With Berserker, you get big crits that take advantage of +damage% modifiers.
---
With Viper, your crits are medium at best. You lose Ferocity, Power, and Precision compared to Berserker so your overall power damage goes down quite a bit.
---
If it were doubled as you describe, everyone would be running hybrid already in pvp and especially pve, because it would mean you could be doing 2x as much damage.
---
Since we don't see that, we can safely assume hybrid deals similar damage to zerker builds.
---
Yeah but in wvw zergs where everyone can take a lot of damage per second, the ability to aoe heal like scrapper can would probably mean they’d still be infinitely capped at max barrier, which would be super obnoxious. You’d need a small percent healing to barrier ratio on the heal trait, like 5-10% tops.
---
i edited that literally half a min later already because it was wrong in context.  
---
whats your point?
---
cHolo benchmarks are already up and it's exactly the same with PBM, just a slightly more complicated rotation. We tried Thermal Valve a ton and the obvious conclusion is dodging for the burns is a dps loss in a skill intensive rotation.
---
Then cWeaver arrived benchid 5k more than cHolo with a much simpler rotation and like 4 different variants.
---
Nope.
---
My honest opinion: roll renegade or firebrand instead. It appears that the meta will be moving in that direction for the foreseeable future. While I’m sad that chrono is getting dumbed down and nerfed constantly, maybe anet just wants us to play firebrigade.
---
Yeah leeches suck
