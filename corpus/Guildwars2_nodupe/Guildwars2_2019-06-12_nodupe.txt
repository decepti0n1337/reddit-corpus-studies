I have never really cared about a 2000 gem skin, but this one is something.

We mainly went scourge because it trivializes the mechanics.

Of course, the one thing I _was_ excited about...

The gift from W7 is the same as the one from w6 collection. Its just there so ppl can buy it if they deleted the old one.
---
Is it illegal? It's against various games TOS i guess, but Google probably doesn't care about video game 'laws'?
---
They aren't real laws.
---
I feel it is unlikely that you will get an answer other than what you expect. There was no error on Anet's side. I wouldn't say cancel your ticket, there are probably less important tickets out there anyway. Just be prepared to have to do it again.
---
Confirmed: last gift is gift of desert mastery
---
I love that map design
---
Nah, you just post of reddit and let everyone suck your e-peen.

where can I find how to translate those runes?

Holy shit dude. I promise I probably love dragons just as much as you do, but Christ, it doesn't matter. It's a game

Check the SC killthread. We were first on all bosses apart from earth Normal mode, don't know about earth hard mode. Also first on all achivements.

Thanks for sharing. At first I thought the environment around the player was their graphics card breaking but turns out it's just a clusterf-- of other players stacking horrendous infusions.
---
do you have a pcitre of the ring yet?
---
so was (or still is) Gorseval, quite fitting
---
Oh lmao 😅 I misread your comment
---
Im pretty sure it is, its infringing copyrights of the ANet for the game and they also used their graphics too.
---
Any dyeable spots? would be cool if we can dye the smoke
---
more like w6.  
---
but if you are used to fractals you probably have no problems with the air one.  
---
earth one just comes down to coordination with pillars. we made pairs with tags up on 5 ppl so they split quick and the others just followed up on their assigned tag.  
---
qadim is like, once you have the first phase down and know what to do, you can just copy paste to the last phases since they are all kinda the same, with minor quirks.
---
Is this an all or nothing legendary with no unique particle effects on its own? Is it dependent on both Aurora and Vision to shine?
---
Buy a Deimos kill, If it's gonna make you that sad and angry and just get it over with. You might even get the gold back farming for 6 hours than waiting 6 for a group to form and then *maybe* kill him.
---
I recommend carapace armor set collection between silverwastes and drytop; best armorset 6 years running
---
I mean think about it, we already got staffs so what will a trident do? We already got rifles so what will speargun do? Outside of staff recycle we dont have any pole weapons so a spear could work. I can see a guard/war/rev with spear. Even ranger!

Feels like such a waste though. I'm pulling 25k dps easily, and yet it's like I'm forced to buy my way through because people are so quick to quit. Its infuriating

Take steam sales for instance, we know they always have seasonal sales. Ie summer, winter etc

---
Up to you man. I mean, you could just play as you normally would and just keep an eye on the LFG, for however long that takes.
---
This has been a wanted feature for guild groups for a very long time, we usually have to tag down and then place a symbol above commanders head and sometimes it scuffs the squad so you have to reinvite everyone.
---
It's the same as Aurora and Vision
---
Is there anything as annoying as Largos? Fuck I hate that fight.
---
Yep!
---
Yeah I don't know man. This community is cool except when you ask for a discussion about things like this. I don't understand what fun it is waiting for mats to be refined. Shouldn't you like go enjoy the game rather than waiting.
---
btw it took me 1 hour and 46 mins to get 13k mithril ingots and 8k elder wood logs. I just don't see the point in wasting so much time for something that shouldn't be a thing.
---
I think the best way to think of it is Tiered Legendary Trinkets. Which ever combination you use, it has 1-2-3 different looks.
---
Several examples in this thread but in my personal case, me and my guildies will roam in wvw for guild missions or what have you and don't really want people that aren't in the guild joining us because they see the tag. There's a bunch of other similar cases for open world were you want a bigger party size and markers but without unknown people joining you.
---
It's just the toggle. If you had an invisible tag before the patch, you still have it. Recommend leaving it on and not leaving squad if you want to use this until the feature patch releases.
---
Kill proof
---
I was always worried about effect overload with 5 accessories or whatever. 
---
This makes sense that it’s always 1 affect altered by how many accessories you have.
---
Source?
---
A tangentially related issue I have with the collection is that the second and third scavenger hunts are, for all intents and purposes, identical. First hunt was nice, giving clever hints. The second hunt was boring, but at least the areas are small enough to narrow the locations down, and I did it without a guide just by running around each zone searching. Then I got to the third hunt and it was... exactly the same clues. I could have done it without a guide, but after searching all the nooks and crannies on the map it was extremely demotivating to have to go through it *again* but look for collectibles that I probably walked right past the first time around and could have collected had they been visible. So I had to pick between doing what I had just done a second time, or using a guide (which I usually like to save as a last resort for tricky collectibles I can't find).
---
That's indeed how it worked, but in case it doesn't work, that's most likely cause the tag has already tagged up at least once already in the instance. A quick relog or map switch will fix that.
---
After 6 hours of trying to get a squad, activating your heart should have been top priority. 
---
How do you forget something like that? 
---
Thats like taking your kid to disney world for its birthday and forgetting the kid at home.
---
The 40 people is a big variant. I might need a name change and alt account, or nothing at all.
---
Just got off my computer, so I'll be able to add later (or if someone else would). The effect is similiar to the effect of the spawn animation..small neon blue/green grass sorta thing. Its also random, you wont always get them but when you do, the sound also changes :D

Where is the option? I don't see hide tag on that image...
---
We get to ride Niv Mizzet? That's pretty slick
---
Gz. I just need 4 of the 6 map currencies now and then I can do the final part myself.
---
I don't think the collection has been as bad as I expected (quite expensive though for someone who hasn't leveled up crafting + didn't have jackal for a few locations so had to buy overpriced treats from TP) but the currency part feels like needless filler to make people revisit the maps. Not a fan.
---
A squad is just an extended party system. Why can't I open a squad and use the functionality without having a symbol on my head that draws attention? 
---
I'm not commanding. I just want to make a squad and maybe put some markers down.
---
What timezone are you? These don't seem to be server time

Did someone try Gift of Maguuma Mastery?
---
I like how they used Scourges to do the cm qadim despite not recommending it for their raids lol
---
I love it
---
Came here for this exact question
---
It's snow crows - the guild that literally EVRYONE else leeches their builds from. this isn;t a reg guild. I'm sure thousands of statics will struggle with this wing over the next few weeks.
---
Weapons and people who refuse to spend money.
---
Big massive oof.
---
Fall with style.
---
This feels like a mistake, ArenaNet.
---
Sorry.
---
Donations might be related to the (still busted) MF event?
---
10000% crap just a recycled aura.... lazy lazy lazy
---
DMed! :D
---
But what I’m saying is that you would never receive THIS as an armour set because there would be too much clipping. They only reason we’re able to get something as detailed as this is because it’s an outfit.
---
Has anyone tried Gift of Maguuma Mastery instead of the Gift of Desert Mastery?
---
The new rifle is a literal rifle. A realistic rifle.

I want it.

The if you zoom in on the corners it looks like its printed on canvas and stretched.

Undoubtedly by far the best and friendliest community of any game I've ever played - the only game that's ever come close was Puzzle Pirates. I recently returned to the game too and it just makes me ridiculously happy whenever I see random acts of kindness and friendliness in the game, it reminds me why I keep coming back to this game and it's such a welcome change after playing other games.
---
you're delusional tbh.
---
Heh maybe they are going to sell this feature through the gem store for only 400 gems to finance the first episode of LS season 6.

To be fair, since the tooltip doesn't explain precisely what "Unique" means, it could mean pretty much anything that the English word "unique" means. As in, this is a unique item in the game's lore, like it's a flavor-text-like qualifier.
---
It's also apparent from the fact that there exists a wiki page for [Uniqueness](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Unique) (and from the number of examples it gives) that the "Unique" qualifier on equipment is not exactly straightforward, even when one does know its proper mechanical definition.
---
Yeah, I understand that randoms can, and usually do screw up everything.  The public scenes in Divinity's Reach are fairly wild because of the random pick up nature of it all.  If it's a premeditated scene, sure, don't let them in, the scene was already scheduled and participants locked in.  I know it's very difficult to get someone into a scene that's currently half way through for both the GM and the player just coming in.  However, this shouldn't stop the communication to talk to them post event if they, the random, are still interested in jumping in to the group later.
---
It's not remotely, the attack rate is similar to VG as far as confusion procs go. It looks faster because each attack has multiple hits but it only procs confusion once.
---
Use the GW2 LFG to taxi into a map that's actually doing events.  You can easily access the Matriarch Platform with a little map know-how and the Gliding &amp; Updraft Masteries.  Look up some videos how to access the canopy during the day.  It takes about 5-10m once you're comfortable with the method.  I'd say the Matriarch phenomenon is pretty unique to VB, and as far as I remember killing any of the night time bosses will give you a gemstone; so if you're in a populated map just kill anything else?
---
Doesn't mean they can't make immersive things from time to time. It's all a matter of perspective
---
The base effect for all three items appears to be identical. It’s when you have multiples together that the effects change.
---
Might want to re-label this as, "Marauder's removed as a stat-choice for my gear," or something like that.  People are going to assume that you're whining about ArcDPS Templates deleting your gear in a fit of ignorance or something.
---
&gt; I go to verdant brink to do meta, population is low because everyone is just waiting to log in once the night event is over just to kill boss, so yeah, i have problems killing the over-run camps but i finally do an ofc the boss is already dead. All these people just skipped the entire meta and i played it and failed because i had no support from the people that should have been there... i even did a bug report asking for them to block people from logging out up there...
---
maybe don't submit false bug reports? if you are afraid of missing out, make your way up there before the bosses spawn like everyone else, ez. if you want/need to do a t4 night meta or whatever... i understand that it's tough to find a group for that nowadays... but that's still not the fault of the people killing the night bosses.
---
&gt; Also, i dont have a mount so i cant keep up with the blob in WvW anymore, you could probably just skip the verdant brink meta with a flying mount aswell now that i think about it... I dunno but buying PoF isn't really an option for me and i dont like being put at a massive disadvantage in WvW and being unable to complete metas and stuff
---
the speed advantage of mounts in wvw isn't nearly as substantial as you make it out to be. it is generally quite easy to catch up as soon as your squad starts to siege. flying mounts are far from necessary to skip the night meta.
---
&gt; I also have to buy the living story which everyone got for free or spend my hard earned gold on which i suppose is ok but you know i just wish it could go on something else..
---
an episode is what? 200 gems? even now, right after an attractive gem store update that's only 65g.
---
&gt; I understand this game isnt fully f2p, they make good quality content that in the past i would of happily paid for but im a returning player and im really not happy with what im seeing, you pay to skip everything at the cost of anyone that dosent have the thing, even the littler things like basic encounters in leveling zones, they die before i can get to them because people on mounts just zoom there and im not even half way there yet...
---
that'S because in reality it's not f2p, but rather an unlimited (and quite extensive) trial. seeing others on mounts and in shiny new armor is supposed to serve as an incentive for you to show interest in the related content. core encounters are still designed with normal running speed in mind, so not being able to reach them likely is caused by other factors.
---
When did they change it to always be 20 guaranteed? It used to decrease further from there, so by the third or fourth run in a day, you'd only get 18 or 15 tokens or something, and keeps dropping off from there.
---
Iirc it was only possible to change LI - &gt; LD if you killed wing 5 bosses before the release of wing 6, which brought us LD in the first place. And it was capped to the amount of LD you could have gotten in between those 2 releases
---
I can't believe their restraint in making a normal looking weapon.
---
I hate their clipping excuse. *Everything* clips something else. It's ridiculous for them to keep hiding behind that. The least they could do is just say "We don't feel like making everything in triplicate because of our past stupid decision to make armor pieces have different intersections."
---
The last two raids were easier in comparrison to Wing 5; they want to make the raids more accessible to the casual community.
---
Why is the right arm so screwed up? And the sleeve is torn. What is that? A known disease in-game? Lore-hounds, any insight?
---
I would say that is extremely improbable, and would make that image far too large, and very, very difficult to have taken that photo of. If you'd said some saner, but still improbably large, size, I would have been delighted and pretended to believe you for at LEAST a second or two! XD
---
You're fun.
---
What I do is:
---
1. Type /mentor in chat to turn on your mentor/apple tag.
---
2. Type /map to turn map chat on, then type “XXXXX BOUNTY ON MENTOR TAG”
---
3. Grab the bounty, then go to the location marked on your map for the target.
---
4. Wait for people to come and help.
---
5. Fight!
---
Instead of doing the Matriarch, pop a mentor tag and do the Patricarch instead. It usually gets done, and you get largely the same reward, ie the hero's choice chest. There are four night bosses. I usually just do the patriarch.
---
Also keep an eye out for LFG because people do run the T4 meta on organized maps. If you randomly rock up to a map without using LFG, you're going to miss out on getting the T4 rewards, ie the bladed coat box.
---
You're not happy with what you're seeing because you don't know how to navigate the game yet. I'd be happy to show you the ropes if you're on a US server. Hit me up in game on Vayne.8563
---
same here. multiple people i'm with have reported this same issue. i can't aim any of my aoe skills near the boss' hitbox, and it's not unique to just the new raid wing. it's making raiding near impossible to do at all. needless to say i'm pretty upset about it, it's soured what was supposed to be an exciting new release lol. i think i'll just hold off on trying to raid until it's fixed.
---
Do ya'll think it was worth the long wait?
---
So disappointing if youre a person who has no interest in that particular look because, congrats, its three iterations of it (and imo, the last one looks the worst...just a turd holding together some white balls).
---
mainly condi from my observations with a splash of power for the first 2 bosses. and the meta for the last boss will prolly be 3 dead eyes with IP as kite and either condi or power comp on the boss. the alternative to that could be a full scourge comp for epi bouncing the last 30%
---
No, the wing and its respective CMs are short. The aesthetic is there, the mechanics are there, but there doesn't seem to be much of a challenge, even on CM. The only boss my group liked was Adina because it needed people to pay more attention.
---
Christ. Where did they come up with that abortion of an effect. I can't belive that's not just some debug output accidently put in a live build. I feel even worse for people who liked the effects so far and have been working through these. If nothing else it had beem a consistent stylistic progression with the first 2 stages, then this... thing.
---
Want legendary trinkets? You have to look at that. Can't hide it. Can't stop at a lower stage. Can't reskin one to something else. You are stuck.
---
Right, my bad, when I read waypoint I only remembered the ones you actually use to teleport with.
---
You were probably DISCORDED.
---
That's it? No other skyscale skins? Really anet?
---
How're you liking S2? I'm in the same boat where I came back after a loooooooon hiatus, but I bought  the dual pack of HoT/PoF. A already had a character at level 60 so I just had to finish leveling him up. I did do the prologue for PoF just for the mount and now I'm thinking about buying S2 + S3 for the story parts.
---
If you like to follow the order of the story then season 2 would be next. There’s a small trailer in lions arch that recaps season 1 and the events leading into season 2. And then eventually HoT and so on :)

Gaeting

I always liked this loading screen. I think the ships are modeled after Hong Kong's ["Junk" boats.](http://img.timeinc.net/time/photoessays/2008/10_hk/hk_junk.jpg)
---
Nice QoL, I also hope ANet gonna change squad icon for Commander, Lieutenants and ourself, with that we can immediately know where is Commander (Easy Taxi), Lieutenants and ourself, even better if we can change icon colour for roles, like blue for healer/support, red for DPS, yellow for tanker and green for default/neutral.
---
[removed]
---
clearing =/= speedkill
---
This is a great idea. Some of the art in this game is really cool
---
No, it's standalone for 2k gems.
---
O happy dagger
---
Why is mirage so good? I don't know the class that well sorry. I know high attack speeds mean more confusion damage though so is that why?
---
That smile tho 😊
---
In hindsight it makes sense, otherwise the aura spam would be even worse as everyone will want to show off their legendary trinkets. As long as the final effect is worth it people will be happy. I like the theory that we will essentially get the model of the great alchemy from Omadd's machine when we have all 5.
---
Right now, with 1, 2 or even 3 trinkets it's pretty meh to be honest. On the other hand, it's the equivalent of a precursor for the true legendary at this point.
---
Finally, since it is essentially an incomplete set, I hope ArenaNET won't wait another 2 years to reach the end-model. If it takes all of LWS5 + new set of raid wings or even LWS6 people are going to get really mad.
---
Well cool to know I guess. But sheesh people seem really upset I don’t know my proper meme origins... sorry folks! Just doing my best.
---
Wow! That sounds awesome! Never heard of that bit of lore.
---
It's looking increasingly likely. Utopia was meant to be Aztec themed which was something ticking away at the back of my brain when Xiuquatl was released.
---
Did every boss with a power como and we had no issues, for the 3rd I can understand but first 2 are ez power stuff
---
You will get it eventually.  
---
Currencies come out of naturally plying the game. You don't need to grind it.  
---
Also, you can get the map currencies with PvP or WvW, so might be worth to do some of those between your pve dailies and stuff...
---
Options tick box: show other character infusion
---
It's pretty unique in its own rite. 
---
Found this old comment who said the same but more [eloquently](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/41e672/alternative_to_celestial/).  (see: top reply)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Maybe your best bet would be looking for ways to obtain stat selectable armor- such as the "bladed" set from Heart of Thorns. (If you have the expansion)
---
Otherwise, you'll just have to crunch out those charged quartz daily.
---
It can also be fun to have 10 people wiping groups of 25+. And if you have an open tag then the pugs start to follow and your group goes from 10 people to 50 and it runs everybody else off the map.
---
I'm a bit more than halfway through it. I'm really enjoying s2 so far. It was a bit confusing at first since unlike the personal story it relies a lot on world events, which I didn't notice and kept thinking the quests were bugged because NPCs would just stand there for minutes at a time. Then I realized they were waiting for the events to pop before it could continue lmao.
---
What do they cost?
---
well dont have a guild so i tried puging it, couldnt even beat the first boss because we couldnt figure out how to coordinate the CC soo thats a RIP for me
---
I don't know what to tell you, I've sat here in LFG pretty much all day while doing some of my summer HW and there hasn't been more than 6 squads doing Deimos, 5 of which ended up not working due to someone rage quitting.
---
I put this skin on several of my characters! The Abyssal Sea, Abyssal Forest, Frostbite Blue, and Frostbite Green dyes are absolutely fantastic on the wings. Love it!
---
Don’t you love how the wings have that shimmer effect 😍
---
See, I can't glow and have particle effects in real life so gw2 is the only place for that
---
Absolutely! And using dyes that already have a built-in gradient effect makes the wings shimmer that much more. Very happy with this skin!
---
Gems well spent!
---
Imagine making a solar system. Literally Aurora.
---
Saffron + emerald is still an unknown result then? I don't have enough emerald to try it myself though.
---
WTF....are u kidding me Anet ´_&gt;`
---
For raiders maybe.
---
Oh yeh guess what, we give you this girly dragon with butterfly wings for 2k gems to match up with your very manly character, cuz you know anet memes.
---
i really thought ANet wanted to permanently move away from such stackable infusions, and instead would opt for more cele/ember/crystal/diamond-like or polysaturating-like infusions. instead we now have this fishbowl that looks like a part cut from the stacked trinket effects *sigh*
---
By chance what game mode specifically are you planning to use celestial gear for, trying to make sure you dont make a mistake.
---
I enjoyed the acquisition of the mount more than the Skyscale itself. The mount is cool and all, but it seems like more of a QoL mount. I like use blasting around on the Beetle myself, but again, I really did enjoy the long goal of acquiring the Skyscale.
---
Autoloot assumes Advanced Logistics, which requires a level 80 plus 19 Mastery Points plus millions of XP.
---
Anyone other non-CoD players here besides me who was also initially surprised the first time they saw the meme, thinking "wow, GW2 is THAT famous huh?" only to find out later that the meme came from Call of Duty and not GW2?
---
"Quack quack quack quack" -- what you sound like at this point. I'm tired of replying to you, so this is going to be my last one. Have fun screeching about the Evil Illuminati Machine and the New World Order that's going to turn us all into protein bars.
---
I agree. Its all very gaudy and seems like kind of objectively poor art direction, tbh. Feels like wading through a sea of deviantart OCs.
---
This game has always had an issue with excessive particle effects during world bosses. Now we have excessive particle effects at all times. The flashiest it should have ever gotten is stuff like Leystone armor, imo.
---
It would be easy enough to add what part of the story it spoils, as the Dragon Age subreddit does (so they have tags for Origins spoilers, DA2 spoilers, Inquisition spoilers, or All spoilers which covers parts of all three games). The majority of the posts will be tagged under that system, sure, but at least you as a reader know what you're getting into if you do venture in anyway. So for this subreddit, it could be split up into Core spoilers, HoT spoilers, PoF spoilers...or even further into Living Story spoilers, as many little distinctions as the mods would want to add. 
---
"You should've played it 4 years ago then!!" is just a bad argument. Plenty of new players or players who haven't played since 2013 try it out every day, and they shouldn't have a major character death spoiled for them on the front page of the subreddit just because they don't have proper tags in place.
---
I am so glad that I did not convert LI to LD yet.. now I know that I only really have to bother with W1-W4 from now on.. :D
---
If you have someone with a Cat tag.. then tosses the tag to someone that has commander tag, but not cat tag.  It goes invisible.. then they just put a squad marker on top of the person driving.
---
&gt; Fewer "run around and collect 25 things" would've been better but having a longerterm goal to work towards is 100% a great move on their part.
---
It could have been dropped to about "run around and do 10 things" and I might have been okay with it. But several collections with 20+ items in them, sometimes having to wait out bosses and meta events? That doesn't respect my time as a player.
---
It only shows top 10 servers, if I remember correctly. There are other smaller severs with good WvW pop aswell.
---
OP, If you started the game as F2P, and then converted into expacs, you will get one free chance to change server later. In case you find a guild that you like in another server.
---
Also check out r/guildrecruitment sub
---
First: If you are not able or too lazy to look up "gw2 chat code generator" via google and find  [https://gw2.ninja/chatcodes/](https://gw2.ninja/chatcodes/) , then I have serious doubt you will be able to wrap your head around any CM by faking KPs.  
---
Second: " The CM versions can't be that much more of a stretch"... Oh boy, your group will have fun. And any 50-100KP will know you faked and kick you. Just by watching videos you should have been figuering out it IS a stretch. Geared for T4 and ad infinitum means nothing.  
---
Third: Why must everybody go the easy way? Get your KPs by STARTING YOUR own group, learn, work through it.  
---
Once you have \~30 KPs you can join 50KPs group and ask if it is ok. Must will keep you.
---
Looks like ill just be collecting the AP and moving on..same with Aurora. They’re really dropping the ball with these legendaries lately, barr the weapons.
---
You WILL get kicked. And blocked. 
---
CM groups are already minor. You will lock yourself out of everything. But that is good according to your attitude.
---
Mesmer is the only class, you don't already know?
---
Yeah. Something meaningful to work towards. Unlocking Warclaw is a cool little grind. The legendary backpack is pretty cool. And you can work towards Legendary armor just by playing.
---
My guess is Sinister works even better than Grieving for short fights.  
---
Condi soulbeast has pretty low power damage, Sinister also gives higher condi damages and crit chance for the trait/sigils that proc some condis on crit, so based on your build you should probably consider it.
---
Usually I try to adjust my organized content build for open world with different traits and sigils, but I run my raid condi soulbeast build in open world and it does just fine anyway!
---
Upcoming legendary ring
---
Content creators leaving to vlog about other games (they used to be able to cover gw2 exclusivly)  
---
top guilds leaving to go to other games (guilds that created websites for this game, just gone)
---
Layoffs at arena net (They were thinking this was going to be the last living world season)
---
Yeh, im the delusional one.
---
How can i get the camps to 10 to buy the pieces for the medicine?
---
Do you want ANET sued? Because this is how you get ANET sued.
---
Yeah basically. It's good on the first and last boss. Qadim has a high attack rate so I was getting good numbers on scepter (confusion damage doesn't show in area stats), sadly we killed it on the first try I went mirage though so I didn't get to try axe even.
---
First thing that came to mind with the last point was menstruation.
---
no
---
Exactly
---
TFW making it wardrobe so you can disable the aura rip
---
:/
---
Yes. Canvas print.
---
Probably the team wasn't working full time on this raid for 9 months.... the raid wasn't the top priority :S
---
Really really wanted you say to fell charr
---
Probably the only good thing about these is the Title you get from collecting all of them.
---
Perfect title for guys like Ez infusions
---
Yes, it's a 3D render, not a real image (a LOT of things give that away lol). I put a lot of time into modeling this and this is actually my second render of it. The first render with Mental Ray came out a little wonky so I wanted to try out this scene in RedShift and that was the whole big deal...just testing out a new render engine lol
---
Order this to a printing company. The price is about $ 25.
---
For those that need more proof that I actually made this...

---
I would be completely fine with it if equipping Coalescense alone would give you only the black goo bubble..
---
The limit is the available resolution :(
---
Adding legendary effects in a tiered format is the worst decision they made in terms of legendary effects since legendary medium raid armour.
---
Any other combinations didn't go to forge together.
---
Thank you
---
I mean I can't argue with that. A fair answer 😂
---
Why does this look better than the legendary armor I spend months making.
---
Yeah it would be nice! I suggested a slider- i don't know if these auras and such have an affect on others' computers but if it does, it would be nice to have that much more control over your visuals (and how other players' visuals affect you)
---
I agree with everything except for the "most importantly" part. To me, the most important aspect is that the reward is actually amazing.
---
I have the exact opposite opinion, it's a very easy collection, nowhere near comparable to a legendary, and yet it has a reward much cooler and more impactful than a legendary.
---
I would be too. I think they should have mounts (or one special one) that can hold multiple people.
---
This is why the only kp worth asking for is title, but really the best way to do a group is just let anyone in and kick aggressively.
---
You could break it down, but I don't think it's worth it. I'd just put it in the bank, you might want it for another character or build later. But I'm guessing you got it mostly for the infusion slot, you can make that up by adding more slots to your rings. I think you can have 3 slots on both.
---
&gt;If only you could edit titles
---
&gt;Just full cleared all cms and normal modes + achieves.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Left boss we did DH stack, right boss we did Scourge and Qadim we did Scourge.  
---
&gt;CMs: Scourge stack for all bosses
---
In squad everybody that has the special action key has a yellow border, so we just said moment there are 8 yellow people all use it. break instant
---
I'm just baffled that the raid legendary is tied into living world, and doesn't have it's own unique effect. The concept of combining effects is cool...but the delivery here is fucked and to me personally....I think it's damn lazy
---
That's not the problem here, the option is completely gone. It's been reported multiple times over here and on the forums though, it will probably be fixed soon.
---
I personally would prefer this level of difficulty if it meant more raids per year.  Ive always raided with a static group...and I pugged and cleared the whole wing and two CMs....I had so much fun today blowing off studying for a med surg final tomorrow
---
Resulution?
---
Hey, what key do you think Battle on the Breachmaker is in?
---
I'm happy people like this and are supporting Anet by buying the hell out of it. But really disappointed that they released only one skin which suits only a certain kind of look.
---
Can you help me understand how to read that. Currently I play on Riverside, I want to move out. My times zone is Indian Standard Time, so what must I look for. And what are the numbers in the brackets? Population?
---
PooOoOooOoOobadooOoOooo!
---
ROFL hahahhahahaa
---
Chaos Armor has been nerfed due to visual clutter.
---
It's nice that you don't have to do the catmander glitch now
---
All banners stack, except the herobanner (which overwrites all other banners with a slightly better buff)
---
I was feeling SilkWing vibes when I first saw it. Was gonna see if I can replicate any of the characters onto the mount (Blue, Luna, and Swordtail, probably).
---
Just tested it out in-game and it's not there.
---
You're full of shit OP.
---
The only issue i have with this skin is the butterfly wings design. That makes me hesitate to get it or not. The head however is definitely better than the original. More dragonish.....
---
Damn I had Aetherblade armor set but changed it before wardrobe FeelsBadMan.
---
Your asura must be a messy eater.
---
I don't really mind if people want to make their characters in to light bulbs. What I worry about is how it affects performance. If all the glowy effects are part of the reason why we can't have that many high quality character models shown then I'd prefer an option to hide auras and have more HQ models.
---
That's how it usually starts. One unique 2000 gem skin in the beginning to maximize profits, later on we'll get more and cheaper skins.
---
I need a choya army with different weapons!
---
&gt; I hate their clipping excuse. Everything clips something else. It's ridiculous for them to keep hiding behind that. 
---
Well firstly, you're equivocating. Just because something clips at all does not make it the same as something that clips a ton or clips *very badly*.
---
Secondly the excuse isn't actually just "it clips". The chestpiece and leggings of light, medium and heavy armours are all built using different riggings, none of which outfits are limited to. The other four slots need to be fit around those. So the overall outfit would almost certainly not be directly transferable to any one armour weight. The cowl specifically *might* be able to be made into a helm, or it might not.
---
Shiny weapon is rare, Ultra Shiny weapon is exotic.
---
I do too. We should both get some sun.
---
What would you recommend? No skins ever? Because literally anything except the default has nothing to do with what's already been set out. What if they found more? We don't know where they came from or if there are more. Out of all the mounts, this one makes the most sense to have all sorts of shapes and designs.
---
Hey, maybe the next ring will make it better. 
---
I'm going for it. Just need 4 weeks to get all the LDs.
---
Then, what are you supposed to do with that amount of LDs? convert them back to LI?
---
Nice, tnx for sharing.
---
For sure—I think the stacking effect is really cool. It’s just lame when the *only* legendary trinkets are stacking and identical to each other. They aren’t even recolors by themselves. :(
---
Perfectly logical tho, no MMO should have endgame content so easy and fast that someone who started in the last episode of this season could do without putting in some proper work.
---
Who's "boss 1" exactly ? Earth, air ?
---
Tbh shit advice. No1 Not everybody gets burned out ESPECIALLY after getting the mount they wanted and No2 You will get it in over 2 years of playing like that lol. Those currencies you can't get unless you play the maps or specifically via pvp. You WILL get them eventually, eventually being in 2y lmao.   
---
Just do a small bit every day (like just do the heart quests) and /gg. You won't get it if you don't go for the currencies tho xD, unless you don't actually want the skyscale.
---
Because a dragon gotta be this big macho looking bad boi right ...?
---
I like purple but yeah some variety would be nice
---
Well, they gave us that option with this patch, and the only real sink for LI/LD is legendary armor, which needs LI. So maybe that's what they want us to do. Make PoF only players buy HoT and convert their LD to LI to get legendary armor. Who knows.
---
It has to be different stats?
---
i just wish the inner parts of the wings clip when idle and running
---
My rant isn't about the gem cost, I would have purchased this if it didn't look like a [butterfly/faerie dragon/discount Seath the Scaleless]
---
Somebody answer please
---
[Snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/reaper/power/) has a power reaper build but it is listed as mediocre in almost all of the encounters and only as good in the Qadim encounter.
---
So viable, yes but not really optimal.
---
By editing `"Guild Wars 2\addons\arcdps\arcdps_imgui.ini"`
---
Agreed, not everyone likes the same things. To your point, it would just be nice if other players had more say in how they want to view the game as well. I find it kind of odd that skill effects were so scaled and toned down yet people are allowed to stack 6 infusions + auras.
---
Skill debugger Oo
---
did they let something from previos environement (dev, staging....) go to production ?
---
or they didnt have any log tool for skills during all that time ?
---
i wonder how their CI is :p
---
(so many developer questions pop up when you see that kind of things)
---
Shout out this being at least 50% more expensive than the other legendary trinkets too for some reason lol
---
The big deal ? Legendaries are also convenient items, not just for looks. Especially for characters with many builds. So a full stacked legendary build makes sense.
---
Can't unsee.
---
I am totally fine with the stacking legendary trinket effects, but I really dislike that on their own, they all look the same. If vision was the lighter aura and some lavalamp-bubbles, and coalescence was the big black blob, I would like it much better.. the way they are implemented, there is no reason to go for vision or coalescence before you have aurora (which is the cheapest of them)
---
Oh right there's no set order. To clarify, if it wasn't clear from the tornado statement, I was talking about the air djinn.
---
[No he is not, you are just too late to the party](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/948826#Comment_948826)
---
The wings are ridiculously cool
---
I think I missed it, just to avoid confusion you're talking about a new effect for 4+ legendary items that was "leaked"?
---
Hey its me your long lost brother
---
I don't mind that they build up and use the same effect when you use them alone. Tbh this is a great way to handle legendary trinkets that have effects. Creating effects for each trinkets that don't overwrite each other but still look good together would be a nightmare.
---
 I just don't like that they look so different. I, for example, would love to have the blueish look from Tier 3 but would rather disable the effects of T1 and T2 because I don't want to dye my character pink or purple. If they would be dyeable that would be perfect. Or let me disable the effect.
---
I read about this part as well but I woulnd't be too worried about it.
---
We don't know yet how Anet intends to proceed with Living World Season 5 and onwards since it will be the first season without any expansion pack tied to it. Could very well be a season pass including some features like new elite specs, masteries and raids, like a smaller expansion pack with less maps and only story episodes.
---
What it would mean for raids is probably a new currency similar to gaeting crystals and magnetite shards and a new story arc to explore.
---
Same  happens to me. It a bug.
---
Basically, there is/was a bug what showed it on Mesmer clones, but can't find the topic right now. It had way more effects, lightning and stuff
---
wait, so can we only make a single legendary ring?  What is our long term LD sink then?  LI sinks into making as many sets of legendary armor as you want, but LD can only make a single ring?
---
Can't find posts about that either, I remember the same mesmer bug when they released vision that was showing the 3 legendary effect but not this one.
---
Pretty sure that appears to you because of cookies. What have you been googling?

Your a lemming who can't see past his own selfish wants, I would kill for the whole game to be made lore friendly without shitty cosmetics but doing so would result in very few mount skins and most wouldn't be any more worth than rocking the original.   
---
Lore and origin is unimportant for fashion and looks to a large majority of people so it would be incredibly stupid of anet to do that (shrine guardian jackal most sold btw). You'd run the company into the ground if you were in charge
---
I feel like HIV is possible to contract through the internet after I've read your comment, because I sure as hell think I have it now. Thanks a lot pal.

&gt; A butterfly skin like this wouldn't suit griffon at all tbh
---
No more a stretch than a hummingbird skin for a skimmer, or a gecko skin for a springer.
---
Recently YouTube has started showing very lowly advertisements and apparently they don't care. I've seen elsagate-like mobile games ads appear and your case doesn't even surprise me that much.
---
I couldn't find it anywhere and it bothered me so much I had to go through my browser's history !
---
It is, I simply pointed out that, as the thread talked about, there seem to be comments about things that never seem to actually have any sources. And thus I would take this with a grain of salt as well, until it is actually given a source.
---
I just did Qadim with some pretty hardcore dudes and the consensus we arrived at is that Condi Renegade is incredible on him. He's a stationary boss and it seems like his hitbox is roughly KC-sized, and those are the conditions in which Renegade flourishes.
---
Thing is, if you’re going to raid as dps role, you also need to have a condi class to which you will switch to, since some bosses simply can’t be damaged very much by power classes cause of their insanely high toughness.  
---
Also in case that you’re going to pug, be ready to sometimes get kicked just for being a reaper. Yes, it sucks cause it seems to be in a good spot now, but general belief is that reaper is a selfish class and that really good reaper players are rare and most pugmanders would rather not risk wasting time to find one of those “good players” and rather go for dps classes that bring more utility to the table for the whole group.
---
Okay, I tried English and German and in both he's unbearable. Maybe he's handsome in French, but I will never know.
---
Racoon griffon best griffon.
---
No more catmander juggling in wvw. Nice
---
I am not 100% informed, but it seems there is no trace of Shiny there.
---
they still add individual armor pieces in the shop once in a while.
---
Wow, that's dumb.
---
Anyone know if you can harvest the nodes multiple times a day?
---
since it seems relevant to your comment: we hit enrage on Qadim but it's actually not too bad to outheal. ^^
---
I am so disappointed right now. I didn't make Aurora because I just don't like the design at all and since Vision was released I was praying that Coalescence would be its own theme and not tied to the living story trinkets... I am so let down. :(
---
I like the idea of stacking trinkets to evolve the shape of an aura, instead of having layers of particles on top of other particles, but this floating balls theme it's just not appealing to me and now we don't have a choice because they're all the same. That's terrible and incredibly lazy. I mean, the effect itself is cheap and doesn't feel legendary.
---
At least I enjoyed last wing and a few refreshing mechanics. But I don't even know if there will ever be a next raid wing to look forward to after the layoffs.
---
Ohh boi, glad I did not go into the effort to start making any of those trinkets. Theoretically I'd like to build them for stat selection, but it's just not worth the effort, as I'm not really playing anyway anymore and just look what stuff they release.
---
&gt;Currencies come out of naturally plying the game.
---
No they don't. You need to go out of your way to visit the specific maps and know how to get them (like doing hearts alone doesn't give them, you need to buy them with VM from the vendors)
---
The dev server for guild wars 1 was called the “stage” server. Not sure the name of gw2 test server.

Yeah, gw2status is down that is why I provided the 2nd link to get the asset server IPs.

so, to sum this all up

* take one of those IPs and add this to the link to your GW2 exe so that it looks like this `C:\Program Files (x86)\Guild Wars 2\Gw2.exe" -assetsrv &lt;theIP&gt;`
---
Yea it didn't work. Guess i'm just gonna reinstall the whole game
---
The reason for your situation is fairly simple imo. If someone joines a pug it has no consequences for them to leave when they feel like it. That's just the nature of the lfg. The better approach to a new raid wing would have been to gather a geoup the week before and set up a discord for that group, get everyone to join and discuss times there imo. That will make it so your groupmembers are more invested into the content and the group and won't leave after 2 wipes since you already set a duration for the progressionnight.
---
I would buy a gargoyle skin in a heartbeat. Either that or a bat skin. Whatever the case I'm hyped to see what they'll do for the Halloween Skyscale skin.
---
Maybe open up a squad in lfg so you can taxi people in that actually want to do the meta. That way you won‘t be stuck with people that leave after matri.
---
A lot of people have been playing hot since release (I have the maps on 100% on almost 20 characters) and at some point you just really don‘t want to do the meta anymore. I really can‘t blame people for wanting to do the bare minimum to get the daily reward.
---
Did you have renegades in the pylons too? I wanted to try that. They could easily sustain themselves with kalla lifesteal. Only problem is can't use mace axe while they are there.
---
You get the skyscale only for the price for the ball, the flute and the combined costs of the saddle. All other things you need are actual farmable for free.
---
If you don't have the story chapters, other story. But then you should also include the 25$ for PoF
---
You have to buy PoF to get the Griffon. Assuming you're paying gold and not cash for the LS is a bad assumption. Also some people got that free. It was given away to everyone in the game in the weeks before the new chapter came out.
---
precedent with beetle says that we will get 2000 gem model makeover skin, and then a regular set of skins when the next set of contracts come
---
I would feel bad by faking KP, I thought only people who look to be carried do that and it turns out to be obvious, had a few kp fakers in my runs and it was really noticeable
---
Thanks for your feedback, i'm glad it helped!
---
What I think would be nice is if Anet can put a limit on how many you can have on a a time (say, 2 max). It really isn't pleasant to go into Mistlock and see several characters with 6 different infusions stacked onto them.
---
I think that you cannot find a good progression group from LFG "off the bat" (or you can, but it's very rare).
---
I have a guy in my static who wanted to make his own progression group for W7, since he wants to go all-out and get all the CMs/achievements ASAP. He started advertising for his progression group in LFG since the raid was announced a week ago. He then "vetted" each application to try and match not just schedules, but personalities as well. He had a successful night raiding yesterday and I'm sure he will today.
---
That's slightly different to what you've described (he was recruiting for hardcore progression, not an "everyone is welcome" type mindset) but I think the underlying truth is the same. If you are committing to every pug that joins through LFG, you're going to get bad people. Not just bad skill-wise, but bad personalities like you described (RQ'ing after a wipe, leaving too much downtime between pulls, not having any role flexibility). That's going to happen.
---
I recommend joining a raid training guild or community. I don't think that's "giving up" like you say. For example, RTI actually put together focus groups for W7 progression in advance of the raid landing.
---
I did not know about this, thank you for the input. Only wish I knew this on time
---
Don't let a single bad night get you down man. That's the thing with pugging, you sometimes get those impatient trash people that break up the groups with a waterfall, it happens.
---
I basically opened up a squad yesterday with 4 friends with a generic 'show some general raiding experience" LFG, and we ended up with a pretty stable group and eventually got 1 boss down, while making good progress on the second one.
---
Try to keep a positive mindset, and things might just go your way.
---
Reinstalling the game, IP showing in the  nslookup assetcdn.101.arenanetworks.com has changed. This should work now i think.
---
Except it would look way more trash than those two others by a long shot. 
---
Please, do attempt to design one that won't look like shit nor animate like shit. You legitimately think making skins is THAT easy?
---
Good stuff.
---
But he's right about new players. They have to buy each episode for 200 gems first. And afaik some mats are needed are capped at 1/day to craft. And I would count the material cost (even if u gathering it) because it's  money u lose.
---
Assuming it's assaulters (i don't think the other prefixes even had marauder so it has to be assaulters?), surely you can just pick it again?
---
&gt; You need to buy at least 2 pages of LW4 story and currently it would cost \~140g. 
---
you need all of lw s4 but it was free TWICE so i don't really understand what you want here, give it for free for a third time ?
---
&gt; After that you need get/collect materials changed quartz + grow lamp which price combined is \~330g. 
---
no, you can buy your way through the time gate or you can get the lamp and food for free but if you wait 22 days.   
---
the only gold you will spend will be on the toys and that's just 6g   
---
you literally only spend 6g on this thing but if you're impatient and want your new toy instantly then pay for it
---
I mean, the question is, if you're here less than 3 months you're not in a position go get either end game mount. If you got the game 3 months ago, every chapter was in the cash shop free. I guess if you're talking about new players as in players starting today but one would assume those guys have other stuff to think about first.
---
Have you tried the Recruitment section in the official forum, or in training discords elsewhere? Pug nature is to easy come, easy go, no string attached and here you lament about pugs do not commit to you and thus you feel left out on certain content.
---
Honestly, it goes both ways. Either you start your own group or join another dedicated group: be invested, punctual and respectful. Your group will enjoy better longevity and quality time.
---
Bug indeed, I have aurora too and had the third iteration, while a friend only had aurora and had the second iteration.
---
These Coffers might improve the dodgy state of KP that we have now, with the guild hall decorations being the random amount that they are, where having 50 kp could mean you've completed anywhere between 10 or 50 encounters of a particular boss. The Coffer will show a more exact amount in this case, although I wonder if people will be able to make the transition at this point.
---
How is this beneficial to anybody but lore autists? They are skins made with the purpose to fit different character themes and look cool. Do they need to make up a whole new civilization to explain the 9tailed fox or how the eternal alchemy works for the star skins? 
---
What I think would be way nicer QoL is them doing more important shit with their time than satisfying these notions from a total of 5 people who can't wrap their heads around how not everything is immersive in a video game nor has to be.
---
what i meant is that materials you are collecting mostly are tradeable so you are spending gold for the mount. it is literaly same as buying, just in form of gathering materials.
---
How about you give a little more time before claiming it baseless. There are a couple of people that claimed it happened during the stream, and now we're searching for the exact fragment. Coming to a post where we are ASKING and SEARCHING for the source and saying its just words because theres no source its like shooting yourself in the leg.
---
Were do you get the value of 330g from?
---
But there is also people who wouldn't buy it if it looked like a giant mech.
---
That's why you have to realize that taste is different and everything isn't tailor made for you. Yes it sucks that the first 2000 gem one isn't your taste instead of others. But other mounts have gotten other 2000 gem options later and have been added to future mount adoption licenses etc. Your time will come.
---
&gt;  that materials you are collecting mostly are tradeable 
---
so? no one is forcing you to buy them
---
I don't even have to read the post to say this: Open your own squad.

---
Have just been having this issue and ONLY software in the above i have installed is Razer Synapse. Stopped it and started the game with no issues. In this instance Razer nFTW…...
---
What they should do is something like caladbolg where you unlock recipes for the collection item so you can craft more.  
---
Or maybe they could make upgrades to mist trinkets similar to how other ascendeds get legendary upgrades. The catch being you need to have made aquired the trinket first
---
Smaller groups can be between 10-20 people. Small coordinated groups are better than large hazard groups. I've been apart of some guild where a 15 man zerg took down a 50ish man zerg easily.

Lmao the best part is his legs didn't reset. Our buddy "Shufflepants" wasn't even able to shuffle the stats on his pants! :(
---
It's naive to think:
---
(a) the leader can coordinate a static progression group without at least knowing peoples' schedules
---
(b) asking what days people want to play and for how long is the equivalent of a ＬＩＴＥＲＡＬ job application.
---
If that's too much then just pugging is always an option. But if that's not fun either for the reasons discussed then I guess the answer to your question is "try something other than raids".
---
it's not even near 330g if you buy everything
---
Enjoy being noob, that was the most exciting thing about this game for me. Explore
---
At this point, with LS4 over and the raid story line also completed, why should future raids still be pof-related?
---
As the comment of the AutoModerator said, cdKeys is not an official retailer. This means that there could be keys sold that were obtained through shady practices like bought with stolen credit cards.
---
You could buy one of the keys there but might end up with your account getting banned (whole account) because a chargeback was issued and the corresponding code was deactivated.
---
Precedent with all the mounts, really. All of them have "this mount is now an entirely different animal".
---
Of course anet wants other professions to tank but the majority of the community will only use what's meta for tanking. Chrono has been meta for tanking since HoT and only with some of the more recent balance patches has that pattern finally broken.
---
You are free to find like minded players and tank with something else. It's totally doable! I have tanked Vale Guardian and Deimos as a heal tempest before and easily killed them. I remember all the way back when Wing 1 first released and my static didn't have anyone with a geared chrono so we sometimes had a tank dragon hunter, tank herald and even tank daredevil a few times.
---
Had a guy join my dhuum group that asked for a kiter in the lfg and a warrior joined asking if we needed a "tank shout heal warrior". He didn't make it into the group but at least he tried!
---
Same reason LS5 will be PoF related
---
Griffon already has the "I am a lion" and "I am a sphinx cat" skins.

Command your own squad then... Its what i did, and had a great time playing for hours. Managed to kill the first boss with just pugs.
---
You also don't naturally play the game. You need to know where there is a mob and how to whack it with a stick.
---
Assuming that we all know the most basic necessities of MMO gameplay, I'd say 'playing it naturally' is a fair statement.
---
You're ok with having to juggle with sub tabs in the hero panel every time and not having keybinds to go to specific panels ?!?
---
The key itself is legit, and no one has yet been legally prosecuted.
---
BUT there are some legality issues still.
---
Good riddance she became very condescending after a certain period
---
good job comparing a fucking mount to a legy weapon   
---
good job comparing fucking 22 charged quartz to 10k mithril and wood planks   
---
good job defending an idiot who cant do basic math and overexerting things
---
they are running a business, it's not there fault that u didnt log in in the last 2 years to get all lw s4  
---
and if u started days ago i really think there are many thing to worry about other than mounts
---
Am I actually the only one who enjoys this? Huh.
---
Even the fact that they stack and, on their own, look the same, is a good decision for me. So it doesn't matter if you slog through Aurora, blast through Vision, or crawl through whatsitsname, you get the same starter effect, allowing you to choose the path you personally enjoy the most without being limited.
---
Let's not forget the part where it's totally unreasonable to make sure people have at least moderately-compatible personalities, given that they're going to be spending a fairly long time working together in a potentially stressful activity. Oh no no, trying to prevent fights and drama that will end up shattering the group is *literally a job application*.
---
I am not defending any of his arguments if you actually took your time to read my comment except his last one where you totally missunderstood what he said and thats it.
---
&gt; So why people say that griffon is more expensive than skyscale?
---
It is more expensive when you factor in every little bit that you would need to buy.
---
If you don't own the Living world Season 4 episodes you will not be able to get the Skyscale. If you don't own the expansion you won't be able to get both. If you don't own a PC you will not be able to play GW2 at all.
---
It is more expensive if you just look at the baseline which is that you own everything that you need for it to actually get it. Therefore the Griffon is more expensive because you need to spend a lot more gold than the Skyscale.
---
Is it worthwhile to swap from scholar to thief runes?

What if I told you that after thousands of years of human civilization and *billions upon billions* of humans, every original idea has already been thought of?

If you prefer Guardian you have some firebrand builds on metabattle which are all more fun and rewarding than druid.

Personally I prefer my tweaked build :

---
Which heal and give quickness, power, fury, and good amount of protection/aegis. It's perfect for open world with friends, and for fractals to replace Chrono + healer.
---
And the dps is not that bad thanks to zelot gear ;) but full Harrier works also.
---
Have a nice day.
---
That level of desperation.
---
This is normal terminology for development - "staging" is the part that's basically the same as production (i.e. the live game) with only some new updates applied.
---
_"A staging environment (stage) is a nearly exact replica of a production environment for software testing. Staging environments are made to test codes, builds, and updates to ensure quality under a production-like environment before application deployment."_
---
Thank you ^.^
---
Who say's it will, though? PoF plot is tied up, LS4 plot is tied up. LS5 could be anything. Season pass is suspected given the lack of a new expac in the works, but we really don't know anything yet.
---
Search GW2 wallpapers and try upscale pic.
---
Oh just as I thought, doesn't give a shit about lore around miniature copies of characters running around but magically cares about lore behind cash shop skins. 
---
Doesn't provide any arguments and just insults, 10/10 post it is very clear you are the thinking mand in this exchange (who is the only salty party for no lore for cash shop skins :&lt;). Consider alternatives
---
It is ugly though...
---
The key is only legit if it was bought with a credit card that wasn't stolen. There's no guarantee. Not that you'll be prosecuted but your account will be banned if that's the case.  I don't think prosecution is on anyone's mind.
---
Dark times indeed. All our hopes now lie with you, little 2nd legendary ring. Please don't let us down.
---
shadow dyes are literally the opposite; they have basically no natural colour gradation; unlike say bloody red, abyssal forest/sea, various bloodstone dyes etc
---
It has already been hinted LS5 will not be PoF related.
---
Wait, people really do the "hurr i farmed it so its free" fallacy here? Yikes.
---
The first paragraph is about kp.
---
&gt;Newer players do exist, but the Skyscale is simply not something that newer players would be in any position to try to get 
---
Then it should not be front and center as the primary selling point of the current content patch.
---
select triumphant or legacy reward track it gives onetime stat selectable exo gear
---
I *think* the idea is that the original balls are sentient blobs of magic, which are then shaped by our experiences and visions. The ugly black blob is coalescence, hateful magic from the underworld that has learned the power of friendship by connecting with the other friendly orbs.
---
Yeah, I don't know.
---
I do hope the final ring transforms all this mess into something complete, like a little floating buddy like Xiuquatl.
---
What's wrong with a fart when you already pooped all over yourself? We are WAYYYYYYY past worrying about integrity of characters right now. And the patch did give us some basic skins, the "shiny" weapons aren't actually shiny and just some basic skins.
---
Good year. Free real estate.
---
&gt; but in the end I have seen plenty "high KP" groups fail hard. 
---
Sure any group can fail, but it's about minimizing the risk.
---
Are you trying to say a group of 10 people with 0 kp will have the same chance at beating Dhuum CM as a group of 10 people with 50 kp?
---
&gt;  After a certain amount of KP it shouldn't really matter anymore. 
---
More KP means more experience with the boss, which means less risk for the group.
---
This should be common sense.
---
&gt; I would rather have them ask for KP instead a certain amount. 
---
People with only 1 KP can often be leechers that got carried or paid for it. No thanks.
---
&gt;  I would advice you just create your own group, there are plenty of people like you who want to raid, but dont like the current raid-scene. 
---
Definitely agree with this.
---
It's possible this will become the new proof for w7 onwards, but opens a new problem - people will also want to open them for the loot.
---
When I first saw the new skin on Reddit I didn’t think I would like it. But then I saw all the amazing dye combinations you can do
---
Since it's not an official retailer, there is no proof if they got their keys illegally in any way. And since you can't check every bought key from that side, your statement "*no one has yet been legally prosecuted*" ist wrong and baseless. You just can't know that. 
---
You should use the official retailers to buy the game. This way you make sure nothing illegal happened with the key you buy.
---
It was made for a certain kind of person, I understand why it looks like this, because that certain kind of person loves spending money on the game. Hope we get some cooler skins later on.
---
Only one skin got released so far...  
---
If it is shiny and sparkly - people want darker.  
---
If it's dark and gloomy - people want cuter.  
---
  
---
Basically wait a but and you will most likely get the counterpart soon enough.
---
Honestly, as soon as someone said that, I was sold, even with the pink glow
---
Can you please show me an instance where people said they want it more colorful and with butterflies and stuff? I'm curious.
---
Not sure if you noticed, but we just got (and then lost) this very feature.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/949216/#Comment_949216
---
Looks like it'll come back soon though, so you should be good to go at that point!
---
Skin is acceptable. 20€ for a mountskin is still unacceptable. 
---
And it baffles me how many people are ok with such a "micro"transaction.
---
if you do get lucky, pugs are also a good way to make new friends and get rid of the need for pugs
---
Its not
---
[Like this one ?](https://imgur.com/YnoVmP2)  would be funny to see an Asura flying with it... " OI ??? that dragon is flying by itself or is it me eyes playing tricks again ? "
---
i know it s not noticeable, anyway it still it use resources for something that makes my eyes bleed (or worse)
---
So wait season 5 still on track to be released reletively soon? Thought we would be living quite the hiatus as they re write everything they plan for the next year or so.
---
What about scheduling a football game with your peers, or a birthday party.
---
It requires the exact same things as applying to a guild, you wanna schedule stuff when the majority of people can come, and you don't wanna invite the people that noone likes or that will ruin the occasion. 
---
If you think that everything that requires coordination is too much to be doable, you probably don't even spend time with other people in real life.
---
Thank god. It's such a let down. I've been raiding for 15 years. This is one of the most boring, stale wings I've ever seen in any game. They have gone so downhill. It's like the raid designers have no idea about other mmos...at all!
---
Well for sure the last raid for the next 6 months or more
---
Spyro is that you?
---
I want it more colourful with butterflies and rainbows and stuff.  And more twinkly.  Magic.
---
In regards  to the OP, CM's are out of the question here. CM are hard (and meant to be hard), and better for organized groups. So the analogy 10-0 vs 10-50 is not up for discussion. A better analogy would be, is a raid party with all 25 KP that much better than a party with KP ranging between 10-25 KP ??? imo it doesnt. The discrepancy should really matter. AND more kp does not mean more experience at all, I have done plenty bosses where I only got 1-2 KP. Because the droprate of KP is rng based, so for example a person with 15 KP is not more experienced than a person with 3 KP . This should be common sense.   
---
\&gt;  People with only 1 KP can often be leechers that got carried or paid for it. No thanks.   
---
so everyone with 1 KP is a leecher..?? Is it not possible that these are people are starting to raid, and therefore dont have many KP yet .?? The OP talks about the casual raider, so it is possible they dont use reddit or discord to communicate with the community. And they want to try raiding through the LFG instead. Finally most of the lower bosses (not the end boss of a wing) dont have a instant wipe mechanic, so 1 person with less KP than the others should be that much of a burder for most groups.
---
Thanks!! I was assuming enameled but wasn’t sure what else
---
Whatever they do, move the FUCK on from djinns and Glenna. To say I'm disappointed by the new raid is an understatement. It's a very tired mix of old raid mechanics with fractals. The first boss is a str8 up mix of amala and Matthias mixed with fucking jumping. And of course every boss is on a platform. I was so incredibly bored. Think out of the box ffs? CHeck out other games, other mmo's, other raids...do some research because anets inspiration is done.
---
It's not illegal but Anet has the right to refuse service (ban your account) if you violate the terms of service.
---
dope
---
Welp...and i was wrong. Sadly
---
You won the endgame
---
That's just no true. There are plenty of skins in those license boxes that look perfectly normal.
---
Without fuckin galaxy sparks, lighting or crystal wings.
---
They also don't kill your performance.
---
I wish there was a show default mount skins tick box in the options.
---
I was going through some of the beautiful Guild Wars 1 concept art and got this idea of making a character select menu concept for a possible expansion that would be set in Cantha. I blended some of the GW:Factions concept art together and this is how it ended up!
---
No, that's buying everything off the TP. You don't need charged crystals then. 
---
And then, you only need an additional 35 gold for the saddle which you shohkd be able to get by farming your currency.
---
So roughly 80 gold for the skyscale.
---
I agree with guy. You are a dick.
---
I wish there was a police car mount in this game.
---
Let's be honest that pungent treats don't even have to be bought. I bought one more on top of the freebie given because I didn't want to do The doppelganger and the Anomaly. Everything else was super easy to do
---
Don't forget electricity and internet costs.
---
"Look it's already pretty bad so it's ok to make it worse" is not an argument.
---
Thanks mate.
---
They would've been perfect for the new mes I'm building.
---
I'm sorry you what?
---
phrasing
---
Oh wow~ I did a Faith cosplay for a video I did back in 2015 for my music guild, and I picked the *exact* same pieces you did!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBid-q982P0
---
B-b-but dude! Purple!
---
Why does this game make me kill dragons anyway. I wanna befriend dragons not kill them :(
---
can do a video with asura later :D
---
The problem is that most people got their tokens months ago and so it does not reflect their *actual* skill at all. It reflects that in *past* they managed to *somehow* kill the boss. Was it close call all the times, or flawless runs? Zero information. So yea, you can religiously follow the linking of some proofs but they are just ... relative.
---
Bloodstone dyes too.
---
I curse you to not get any good drops for 7 years. /joke
---
He didn't resort to it. That was the whole point of the comment chain and I don't exactly understand why you are moving the goalpost or using the childish 'B-But you d-don't need it!' argument. It was about Treize_XIII claiming that time is free, to which jihuiz responded that it isn't. Your comment is irrelevant.
---
&gt; A better analogy would be, is a raid party with all 25 KP that much better than a party with KP ranging between 10-25 KP ??? imo it doesnt. 
---
Sure, but i'v never seen a commander that cared about that difference.
---
I frequently join pugs where i have *slightly* less than the required KP, and no one cares. 
---
&gt; AND more kp does not mean more experience at all, I have done plenty bosses where I only got 1-2 KP. Because the droprate of KP is rng based, 
---
Which is why people ask for larger amounts of KP, to prove experience.
---
&gt; so for example a person with 15 KP is not more experienced than a person with 3 KP . This should be common sense. 
---
But a person with 25 is objectively more experienced than a person with 1...
---
I have no idea why you're even trying to argue this point.
---
&gt; so people with 1 KP is a leecher..?? Is it not possible that these are people are starting to raid, and therefore dont have many KP yet .??  
---
It's like my point of "minimizing risk" completely flew right over your head.
---
&gt; Finally most of the lower bosses (not the end boss of a wing) dont have a instant wipe mechanic, so 1 person with less KP than the others should not be that much of a burder for most groups. 
---
Irrelevant.
---
If you want the smoothest run possible, which is what most experienced commanders starting a pug want, they want to minimize risk as much as possible. It's completely understandable &amp; justifiable.
---
If you want a less smooth casual run, then start your own raid group and say "all welcome" in the LFG, or join/start a training group... I'v done it myself, and it can be fun, but it's undeniable that it takes much longer.
---
You're free to start/join any type of group you want, and other commanders are free to do the same.
---
close to 25 bucks for a mount LOL.........sorry Skin LOL
---
&gt; I wonder how the new skin looks with wings dyed shadow abyss?
---
Depending on the shaders you chose - https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bzelhr/psa_skyscale_2k_gem_skin_has_a_purplepink_dye/eqs27z7/
---
Better than a bunch of stupid posts about a paid mount skin or talking about content only a subset of people actually play.
---
I personally only like subtle auras, something on the style of liquid aurillium.
---
Most of the FFXIV raids are on platforms.. I'm not sure that platforms are the problem. 
---
It might be a burden of mechanics thing, though to be honest, I am in the boat where I think it's less the destination nor journey but the people along the way?  There will always be cones, lines, circles, but the people you carry with you lingers much longer.
---
I am not sure where your frustration with djinn and glenna come from. This is the second wing to feature djinn and the first to only have djinn as boss fights. Glenna is entirely interchangeable and barely noticeable too. As for platforms, I kinda understand what you mean. However, I prefer ridiculous platforms over the awkward camera situations we have on sloth and MO.
---
Oh boy, here I go buying dyes again
---
Have you ever seen realms falling off from the mist before? How do you know this?
---
Do you want some fries with all that salt?
---
I think many players here pay gold for gems. 700g for a well mayed skin don't seem that bad. Someone is paying real $ for the gems to gold ofc but I guess that groups smaller/less represented here. 
---
And this have always been how GW2 earns it's money, one time cost for the game, no monthly subscription fee but selling skins/QoL stuff for $. So don't seem unfair/explorative for anet release expensive skins, it always was expected.
---
Nice work!
---
Wait it does? Fuck.
---
I had 0 charged crystals when I started the feeding step. I crafted one food a day while feeding the skyscale and bought about 6. Took longer than the 4 days to feed it like that but I needed that time to farm the season 4 currency anyway.
---
The biggest cost for me was the grow lamp which cost me about 35gold from the tp. It's probably cheaper now. Where are you getting 300 from?
---
But can I hide it from myself? :(
---
Just wait a couple of months and this map will be a paid content as well.
---
It's MR E like Mystery...
---
I wish people would read before they post
---
Again, read before you post dumbass
---
&gt;I saw that there's no interaction bind. Does it trigger when you just want up to it? is there's collision? Can they stack?
---
you have to get close to it and it makes us jump I didn't try to fill them up but I don't see the point and it's still jumping platforms
---
Took me a second
---
Do they make or break?
---
Progression PUGs entirely made out of random people with a random number of kp are very risky. Its like rolling 9 dice and expecting a 6 every time. You have on way of influencing it in the LFG but your best bet is to get an incomplete static. These people didnt just hop on LFG to check out how the new wing looks like but they made an appointment to learn it over hours of failing. Sounds like you got unlucky yesterday :/ 
---
Thats at least what I can tell you without going back to the good old "get a static". Making your own group isnt even helping too much in this.
---
&gt; because they're not clowns
---
When I was young, I had the opportunity to perform in the circus, but I turned it down. To this day, I'm sorry I didn't leap at the chance.
---
The issue is that this isn't a unique reward for raids...
---
Not from the mists, but they are landmasses anyways. Once in the physical realm the condensed mists that form the realms of the gods are as physical as Tyrian mounts.  
---
We've been taking stuff from the mists for ages now. Once we took something from the Underworl into Tyria, it was physical. 
---
We saw [the cinematic](https://youtu.be/v07-M1ntPGw), there was no magical giant sculptors chiselling them as they fell, or cosmic walmart baggers putting them in place. They were scattered all around him.  
---
So if those landmasses are physical, and they fall following non-magical physics, they would be in a scattered pattern.
---
Kinda reminds me of the hexer's set from DS 2.. [at least a little bit anyway.](https://leviathyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/felkin-concept-art-1050x720.jpg)
---
I meant "playing it naturally" as in doing whatever you feel like (exploring different maps, participating in events etc.)
---
With this definition you can play naturally for a hundred hours without visiting the season 4 maps and that means no map currencies. That's why I said it requires going out of your way.
---
That would be me for example: 600 hours in the game and hardly any s4 currencies because I simply played other maps apart from briefly visiting the maps while doing the story.
---
Just happened to me and a few others. Didn't seem as widespread as when SB bugged for me. Only a few of us were saying so in chat while the majority said it was fine.
---
Kinda weird for Anet to leave one of the possible combinations out.
---
Let’s say that you have no map currencies, how much gold could you have farmed in the time it takes to obtain all of them for the skyscale saddle?
---
I am capped in LD but this is not the case for everyone, 150 LD is 15 weeks of full w5/6/7 which is a decent amount. Considering the elegies we got guildies that stored them beforehand because it felt obvious they would be needed (and if not this one, at least Vision which shared the same pattern as Aurora). Well I still need to finish the first collection tough...
---
It's tied to PoF core content, not LS, but yes, if you compare it to raid armor (which is tied to HoT core content) it's much more tied even it's just a single ring compared to 3 whole sets of armor.
---
Legendary armor collections basically asked to do certain things on HoT maps (remember having to kill the gerent 5 times back when killing gerent was very hard) and the most grinding thing you had to was to get those tokens that required you to exchange certain weapons (you could do it daily).
---
On the contrary, a single ring has the level of requirement as a full legendary weapon. It requires full map completion of each PoF core map and a ton of elegy mosaics. It's true that the drop of these has been increased but we are still talking about a lot of grinding of legendary bouties and other meta events that give them. Instead you only require 150 LDs (remember that you can even convert 168 LIs into LDs). So basically the only raid content you need to to for this raid ring is basically kill each boss once.
---
I tried that yesterday (repeat SB) and no luck on the node again.
---
And with the wrong one, it becomes an eye-searing monstrosity.
---

From the point of the people who want to stack mobs well and kill them fast - they break

From the point of the people who want to be a golemancer - they make

Trash tier raider here. I support this guild suggestion. I've done training with Rum Guzzlers twice, and had pleasant experiences.
---
Depends on what hardcore and casual means honestly. You wont break any records with a power reaper but it is very reliable and sustainable. The only "power" encounter I can think of where it actually sucks is the vale guardian, and there also only if you choose to outheal the greens.
---
As much as I love Cantha, I don't want to see it in GW2 yet. I prefer to explore new lands lile the charr homelands in the far NorthEast or anything else completely new tbh. Your concept art though is really well done.
---
Edit: typos
---
Uh no. Ignoring the cost of the season 4 itself, I have no idea where you get that price from.
---
Grow lamp is 30g, the other toys maybe 5g combined.
---
Skyscale food is around 47g
---
Extra pungent skyscale treats are completely optional unless you want to skip some jumping puzzles and world bosses. Jackal is the only relatively expensive mount to get and it's needed for a couple of parts there so you can either get jackal for 20g or buy what, 3-4 treats for 21-28g (atm)
---
Saddle is 30-35g(?)
---
That's around 140-145g without any crafting whatsoever and without having a 20g mount (I would've got the mount for it but didn't want to go out of my way to get the sand portal mastery)
---
Horses don't exist in Tyria.
---
No, we don't talk about the death knights in Kryta during GW1.
---
Good thing that's just your opinion and not a fact.
---
Correct i do not
---
Wait, I don't raid, what happened last time?
---
Very odd
---
Good to know.
---
I dont think Anet ever confirmed that you need PoF to play LS5 or related content.
---
Subscription MMOs have you pay $10/month for just the privilege of logging in. 
---
It's not surprising at all to me that some people will choose to spend roughly that amount on cosmetics in the gem shop instead, since they're effectively saving the money on the subscription. 
---
I personally won't. If I want this skin, I'm going to farm gold-&gt;gems, and I imagine a lot of other people will as well, but just by doing that I would be supporting ANet as well by inflating the value of gems and incentivizing more people to buy gold with gems.
---
Correction on the cap, its about half that. 150 conversions.
---
someone call police
---
Well $20 is not micro but it is like this bec. you can actually turn gold to gems. It is a complete remodel with added effects so a 600-700g price point does not seem bad to me as long as it is not rng.
---
&gt;Where can i get a mount?
---
Do you own the Path of Fire expansion? Mounts are exclusive to PoF, if you own PoF and are on EU I can help you with the mount.
---
I love everything that is Colorful and Rainbow. So bright and shiny it blinds my Enemies forever. They just much more Fun. so I would dig an even more colorful Skin for every Mount. Just my Opinion
---
&gt;Raids are not for the audience of this game;
---
Yes because everyone in this game likes the EXACT same type of content and aren't allowed to enjoy different things.
---
&gt; they are fringe content that takes the extra 80% effort for 20% of result. 
---
Some people enjoy doing more than just mindlessly mashing buttons in open world and collecting loot. If that's your thing then fine but I, for one, enjoy being challenged and having to improve and work with other people that I know. The result for me isn't the 3 rare and 5 greens I get at the end of an event. It's improving and having fun with other people. And by the way, if you have a good group that can clear bosses easily raids are one of the fastest way to make gold in the game.
---
&gt; If you want to have proper raids and proper raid communities, you build a game around those and ditch everything casual 
---
And fail miserably because your audience is too small and your game will never sustain itself financially. There is no reason that even if Gw2 isn't a raid only game it can't have good raid content.
---
&gt; If your target audience is the casual, non-competitive young MMOers plus older people with jobs and families, raids won't really work to anywhere near the level of hardcore gamer's expectations... 
---
Again, a game can have more than one type of audience. I don't see any reason that older people, people with jobs and families can't raid either. What you're describing is just normal adult life.
---
You don't have to be hardcore or play 40 hours per week to do raid content.
---
Besides, raids (and fractals for that matter) actually do a good job of offering options for people who want different levels of challenge. You can run most bosses either in normal mode or challenge mode. There are also build that are easier to play and give good results.
---
Thanks for the advice. Do you recommend do HOT before POF?
---
To be fair, I see way more starmounts than I do aura characters and they are a lot more blinding in screen real estate.
---
It's easy! All you need is a curtain pole, some white paint and a whole lot of hallucinogenic substances.
---
Don't make things like this for fun. :"(
---
Still hope.
---
I could get that from MightyTeapot when watching his stream but guess what he did when cutscene happened...
---
when doing challenge modes safety is the main priority and scourge allows you preciselly that. After all you only need to do them once.
---
Also for first kills it's usually a good idea to prioitize safety until you learn the mechanics.
---
reminds me of fairie dragons from
---
heroes of might and magic 🥳
---
I like how when describing how an elder dragon and the land around it fall from a giant tear in reality into the ocean we use physics to declare OTHER people are the ones being absurd.
---
It is a lot of assumptions, but not completely unfounded. You have people like teapot alway mentioning and discussing ‘is this the last raid wing’ and many of his guests (who raid a lot) saying it probably is. Combined with raids being, well, not done by a lot of the population and Anets recent troubles.
---
They already take an age to get each wing out, and it’s a sustainability thing. Do they have enough resources to keep it up? Is it worth it? Should they can raids and pump those resources into something more people would participate in? These are all the questions. 
---
Personally I hope they do keep raids going. I think they will tbh. Even if it’s quite spaced out. Variety of content is good, and although I only raid sporadically, they are interesting.
---
Looks nice. Could really use a change of view from the pyramids, honestly. I miss the nice HoT one too. Even better would be a log in screen that shows of multiple characters at once (7?).
---
Oh, I know. Did it for CM as well.
---
https://youtu.be/5hE4ynuZvZo
---
At the end, he has it from someone else. Silly guy.
---
Because most of the dragons in this game are... let's say... *hostile.* Yes. Some aren't, and you'll meet the not-hostile ones, but most of the really important ones are.
---
Only if you are a minmaxer
---
Wait for it :)
---
But even if it was not official we already knew with several months of advance that PoF was following the end of LS3, and we knew it would have to be purchased with real money.
---
We don't know anything about LS5 yet. And the end of LS4 doesn't hint at what's coming next.
---
Anet giveth and Anet taketh away.
---
[Centaur's](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Centaur) exist, and why would it matter if they dont exist in Tyria? Humming bird didn't exist either and they made that mount? How does that have any correlation to mount SKINS?
---
&gt; But even if it was not official we already knew with several months of advance that PoF was following the end of LS3, and we knew it would have to be purchased with real money.
---
Leaks don't count in this discussion, because ANet certainly doesn't make business decisions based on leaks. You can bet that the average GW2 player didn't know about the leaks months in advance.
---
Echovald is to the west of the Jade Sea, the sides should be reversed.
---
No, the issue is that people think it's ugly and can't reconcile their desire to make all the legendary items with the fact that they don't have to use something if they don't like how it looks.
---
Me, I'm just enjoying the schadenfreude.
---
i think it's hideous :3 they can't even let us change the purple/pink parts. sucks. and it's a 2k gem skin.
---
I support this idea!
---
Gear up, play through living world season 2 (1 isn't available but you can watch it on youtube) and then give Heart of Thorns a go.
---
Be warned, HoT will crush your hopes and dreams when you first wander into the jungle and you will die a lot. It happened to us all.
---
See? There's one voice that points out what an absolutely uninspired shitshow raids have become, and it gets downvoted to hell. This new raid will not save ArenaNet.
---
They're exotics, not ascended. Didn't think stat-changing worked on exotics and would probably be just as expensive as new ones. I say they effectively deleted them because salvaging them will not recupe the cost of getting new marauder pieces. Or would you prefer I said they effectively deleted \~20g and 5 transmutation charges from my account?
---
When it happens. No one can really answer that question.
---
I like these threads because I get to see people work so hard, coming up with worse and worse excuses to try to justify the perfect rectangle island instead of just admitting that yeah, ok, how anet did it was a bit silly.
---
lazarus got resurrected in the third raid wing
---
so soon?
---
Well, if aurora + vision = floaty purple blobs, maybe vision could be some sort of a purple liquidy aura. And coalescence could be the black liquidy thing in the blue-white circle that, idk, maybe is centered around one or both of your hands? And then vision + coalescence could have a different aura? Or coalescence could be a bunch of the floaty black blobs in the places where aurora is so that vision + coalescence looks like coalescence has been coated in the vision aura. 
---
Stacking legendary auras is certainly a cool idea, but giving the same aura to three different legendaries, each with their own story, is lazy. I don't see how Aurora and Vision, which are more centered around mastery of the living world and your memories of what happened, should have the same aura as coalescence, which seems to be centered around dealing with hatred and strong emotions. I mean, the precursor is even called "hateful sworl".
---
nice job \^.\^
---
You need lungs to start breathing?
---
Imagine making 3 Aurora, we literally have that anyway.
---
You know what else are convenient? 32-slot bags and extra inventory slots.  I have 3 or 4 full sets of gear that I carry around on my rev and no legendary trinkets.  Legendary armor is really the more important part there.  I make it work and you can too!
---
great skin, really. but none of them 25$ skins are worth it. only if i got one in the blc id be happy. they should be 5-10bucks tops.
---
but the stained glass effect on the wings are dopeeee
---
It would be cool to see IoJ, or explore an area wholly new that we’ve never seen on a map.  A mist portal taking us across Tyria to somewhere we couldn’t reach otherwise would be amazing.
---
Edit: I want cantha though.  Shiro rev in cantha would just be tagachi talking shit...I WANT IT
---
No, the issue is that you need two other legendary trinkets to get the unique effects.
---
Coalesence was hyped up to be an underworld-theme legendary, with things like the precursor literally being called "Hateful Sworl", and having to meditate in order to calm it down.
---
The third tier effects look fine. It's a cool black liquid thingy in an orb. That's cool. The issue is you need two other legendaries to reach it, otherwise it becomes a Mesmer-themed legendary with a purple aura. WTF?
---
Soooo you just copy pasted someones post. Karma whore.
---
I've been out of the loop for a while. What did they do this with recently?
---
If only everyone wasn’t talking over the top of it
---
When I made the comment I was on Ch.4, that's as far as it let me go, now I need to buy the rest. Not sure how much of S4 is available for free.
---
For the love pf gods Anet please give us Cantha!
---
I don’t get how they would think that literally *anyone* would want this... 
---
Casual players outraged that their next-tier effect is raid locked, and raid players mad that their cool, raid-only legendary looks the same as an open world grind reward...  -.-
---
Do not fake kp as that is just rude and dishonest. You are better off having some kp, but not at the required amount and asking the commander to give you a chance as you know your rotation and the mechanics, and to kick if you are not performing. Most of the time I see kp requests as arbitrary and the commander is fine with people with less as long as they communicate well and can perform. And for the first week or 2 of a new wing, saying you don't have kp yet but know all the mechanics and to kick if you're underperforming should be enough.
---
Hopeless.
---
They're pointing out that people are clamoring for more when we literally just received a skin, because some weren't happy with it or expected (keyword) something that suited their specific tastes instead.
---
But if we got the grimdark skin first, then the opposite crowd would complain that we didn't get something elegant. And even when we get a darker-themed skin, I'm 100% positive people will complain it wasn't what *they* imagined for it. There's no appeasing everyone.
---
Yes, but unless you played Wing 3 prior to LS3ep4, then that context was diminished. You also have the entire seeding of the upcoming White Mantle aspects of LS3ep4 and Eye of Jathir aspects of LS3ep6 properly introduced in raids.
---
It is annoying enough trying to keep up with the story constantly jumping back to things of importance in Guild Wars 1 if you didn't play that game. It would be even more annoying if you didn't get that extra context within raids. I feel quite bad for people that don't raid and picked up Guild Wars 2 because of what it did differently from Guild Wars 1.
---
Something being possible won't stop it from looking off.
---
The main reasons to tweak the map art around it are aesthetics and immersion.
---

Ikea?
---
Because we still understand Tyria's physics to be based vaguely in the physics of our own world. Unless there's some tangible explanation for how things behave, we're going to make assumptions based on how we understand reality to work. The large-scale high-fantasy elements surrounding the situation don't apply: it's still rocks falling down.
---
Even in square-based games like Minecraft, if you dump water on a flat surface, it'll make a vaguely circular puddle. Because that's how our reality works, and how we naturally base our perception of things *unless guided otherwise.* If something deviates from this without justification, it'll feel wrong to people.
---
I HIGHLY recommend you finding someone to help you getting that mount before you hit level 80. Even the non-upgraded version of the Raptor is still a huge improvement to running around on foot. And like the other guy said, if you care about story spoilers (there won't be much), change the game language and skip all dialogue and cut scenes.
---
I second that reckon.
---
Go Team!
---
This is the patch bug thread, not the weekly discussion thread. Bug reports go here, questions go there.
---
I would recommend saving your 2x Instant Level 80 Boosts for your future characters, not your first character. Unless you really feel like you are stuck or hate Engineer, it's better to learn the game gradually on your 1st character.
---
&gt;The maps will be built around the story (which is much better, as seen in LS2).
---
Oof, heavy disagree there, mate. While there was been a few rough spots in LWS3+4, overall the map design (at least for exploration) was LOADS better in those seasons than in LWS2. Also, LWS2 easily had the worst story in the entire game. Honestly, after slaying a dragon suddenly I'm in a guild full of Mary-Sues who I am suddenly supposed to care about? Compare that to the Balthazar/Joko/Kralkatorrik arc and there's no comparison at all. I hope they keep the map design of paramount importance as it's the replayable content that really matters.
---
All three bosses are djinn?
---
Which post did I copy paste? I did this in Photoshop by myself, in around 5 minutes. If you are referring to the idea, I'm sorry that I didn't see that a similar post was posted 3 weeks ago. Else I wouldn't have bothered with this.
---
Yeh cuz girly pink and purple rainbow dragons are the norm in fiction.
---
Counter-point: Raids have had some of the best storytelling quality in the game. If they hadn't done it in raids, what are the odds those threads would have been painfully unfulfilling?
---
I dont even have the mount yet and this makes me want to buy the skin
---
Someone is going through this thread and downvoting everything. Look at the controversial comments on the thread, most of them are reasonable suggestions. What can you do. /shrug
---
you can join a training guild NOW they are doing progressions on those new raids.
---
Not a noob question, just a fucking stupid one.
---
Don't do that. Don't give me hope. Jokes aside it looks dope!
---
I am stealing this.
---
i will go to your party, eat your food and leave when i want.
---
Have you looked at your linked posts? 
---
One of them is copy paste from Orr and the other one is literally a joke.
---
OP did a great job letting the map look natural and make it fits into the world way better.
---
Bubbles. For sure. During or after. Pretty sure him and Zhaitan were the reason the sea was uncrossable in the first place.
---
Thank god you left that bad mix guild that was making you hate raids
---
R I O T  
---
the game does not give me what i want NOW!
---
then fuck this game im returning to blade and soul. F2P is my title
---
The idea isn't new, but your picture looks really great. I would love to see this version ingame.
---
&gt; two more chances to save it
---
Like, I am totally behind the idea of the final form being something like the vision of the Mists like people have speculated, but this all seems extremely underwhelming when you consider how many *legendary* items are going into this.
---
Ridiculous time costs in a PvE environment where I don't want to Run to Place #1, press F; Run to Place #2, press F, Rung to Place....
---
When you've run to All The Places? You get a new joyous new collection where you Run to Place #1, press F; Run to Place #2, press F, Run to Place...
---
Then you get a new shiny joyous collection! Nope. Not doing it.
---
I am patiently waiting for a way to make my GW2 experience more immersive.
---
Did you used clipping to improve the costume? Or is it my eyes that deceive me?
---
So because of racism.
---
Yay now I'm hyped!
---
=D
---
Is it really that hard? Also season 2 costs gems right?
---
Nooo but I want to befriend em not kill em :(
---
Replied :)
---
2025
---
Or some raiding!
---
You simply can't expect to go into a PUG group and have people not leave all the time. You should have really low expectations when playing with a PUG group, basically shouldn't expect to get much done.
---
If you looked at the state of the game 8 or 9 years ago when the equipment systems were designed it'd start to make sense. For example, backpacks are coded as weapons in their backend
---
tldr: duct tape
---
[https://www.godsofpvp.net/builds/thief/](https://www.godsofpvp.net/builds/thief/)
---
so it's the game's fault that someone was rude to you on reddit?
---
Please don't cite WoW as an example of good story progression! While the Lich King story worked in WoTLK, anyone playing through that content now doesn't get to see the raid, has no idea of how any of the plot threads of the expansion end, and has no idea who the fuck the burning guy in the ice chair on the Northrend splash screen is.
---
[deleted]
---
Except you need PoF to progress with skyscale collection,unless it skips those steps required for collection if you dont own PoF....(that is some new level of goofy tho)
---
Too late. Next expansion "Fairies of the Mists" incoming.
---
sighs... the reason why I started playing guild wars TT\_TT.... the memories..
---
Still waiting on How To Dance Volume 2....
---
The shawl is made of smoke so its fine if it clips
---
Cantha is the one thing I want in this game. The only thing that would make it better is if they kept true to the lore and banned all not human races from entering (except norn)
---
At what point was I not calm, if anything you were the aggressor as I simply posted a thing that happend. I didn't remotely mention if I liked it or not, even still I responded with my opinion and that is not ok even though you have your opinion right before that? Talk about a double standard.
---
We had Scourges on the pylons but any ranged class should be fine, like Deadeye. We were experimenting with solo healer to emulate 9-manning it, so that they could sell the kill later. The healer said it was very tough, so it might be good to use Parasitic Contagion on Scourge or Invigorating Precision on Deadeye.
---
I was secretly hoping you were right to be fair :(
---
Oh that's good info!
---
I hit the same roadblock as you (Bifrost?) And scraped and slogged getting a few tokens from the Arah reward track in WvW, and a few from a pug run one time that Arah was a daily (patient party leader)...finally what put me over was getting a zone completion that yielded a BLC key, and the chest dripped a Tyrian Exchange Voucher.
---
Since then, I've gotten 4 more vouchers that I've been saving. I'd like to use some to get sigils of nightmare for my condi mirage, but I think I'd need 3 of my 4, which leaves me less than what I'd need for another legendary.
---
Was a nice stream, watching players figure out complex mechanics on the go while having to fulfill their role is always fun.
---
I love that we used to only have eye cancer at ground level, and now it's in the air, too. Now my screen can be filled with eye cancer from top to bottom. Thanks anet!
---
You do. You probably also need exotic gear at the least.
---
My point was that it is silly to add the costs of the episodes into the cost of the Skyscale. We can start adding on basically everything. At the end of the day, Griffon has a 250g cost and Skyscale' s varies based on your crafting but is less than 60.
---
Imagine paying actual money for gems in 2019
---
Brought to you by gold &gt; gems gang
---
I knew the song, but never saw how satisfying the video for it was, thank you!
---
Yea, the wardrobe.
---
Well if you're up for it you can do some farming for airship parts in Verdant Brink and select Marauder stats on the [Bladed Armour](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bladed_Shoulders_Box). You can see the available prefixes on the wiki.
---
If this franchise's past is an indicator of its future, it's safe to expect a future Living World season and/or expansion to be set in a new or distant land, e.g. Cantha, along with thematically matched faces and hair styles.
---
Lol who pays real money for gems?
---
If you going to have 1 effect that upgrades, rather that different unique effects for different tastes, that effect needs to be universally loved which it seems this isn't.
---
Same tbh
---
I was really surprised they gave those new hairstyles for free with PoF. They're so well done, a lot of the older ones look so dated in comparison. Was eased they gave free charr customizations too
---
lol damn all i got from this thread was, "people won't like you if you play reaper". seems like i won't be raiding anytime soon
---
The Luxons vs Kurzicks factions was literally my favorite thing in all of GW.
---
&gt;Most raiders love Glenna.
---
My raid static made a list of each member's "greatest raiding qualities". Mine was "kills Glenna".
---
&gt;XOXOXO,
---
&gt;Zommoros.
---
.... Oh.
---
Hopefully when we go to Cantha they'll finally give us that asian male face they've been using on NPCs since the base game but never bothered to give us.
---
Plenty of people or the game would shut down?
---
So make your own group
---
For Sabir, we had a fairly standard comp. We had one Mirage and mostly Daredevils as DPS, it seemed to work fairly well once we got on top of the mechanics. Sabir also seemed very forgiving in terms of outgoing damage. 
---
For Adina, we a mix of Mirages and Daredevils. We kept losing a lot of people so we tried to merge the pillars when we could, which sort of worked? We ended up getting extra stability by switching out one Chrono to a FB/Ren in the other subgroup (+ stability mantra on chrono) since people kept getting pushed to their deaths by hands in the final 25%. We ignored the hands, since it felt like killing the hands wasn't really worth it when you could just dps Adina down.
---
On Qadim 2 we had a very, very strange but very safe composition. We're still not sure how pylons work exactly or how to survive while tethered to them (in our first few tries we kept getting downed by... something after a while, we're still not sure what - does anyone know? All three pylon dps downed at the same time each time, more or less), so we ended up with three subgroups - 2 dps + some form of healer/buffer such as druid since being tethered to a pylon seems to give some quickness and alacrity, then a Chrono to tank with the DPS trading the pylons and grabbing the balls every now and then. Our DPS was mostly scourges here, since they have an easy time surviving, although we had one rifle deadeye as well. Still gotta figure out how to do it with a 'proper' composition though.
---
:'''''''’'''''(
---
Well. I fo agree with you on that point and I very possitive that small details matter alot, but it is not like I sit a lot looking at the WM. I have my Teleport Contracts, Special Passes that takes my every toon in every place (or close to it) I mostly need. The WP acces is in milliseconds range, longest maybe was maybe a few seconds for me. So it's not like it is that big of a bummer over all, still one nonetheless. 
---
Sure it could be better, but I care most for graphics, gameplay and story. A few rocks that felt in a square configuration, maybe the portal Aurene created was square-ish, maybe these are only the big rocks that are visible with a lot smaller-sized landmasses underwater.
---
Or a reward from Guild Wars 1 Hall of Monuments.
---
I can understand that you enjoy combat. You probably enjoy PvP and WvW a lot more than I do because that's combat focused. (I find those arenas boring for long periods of time.)
---
You said you couldn't understand how "anybody" could enjoy the collection.  I was giving you another perspective. 
---
Just because content is different from what you enjoy doesn't make it bad content.  Please understand that everyone likes different things. This is an RPG and lore is a part of that.  Some of us do in fact enjoy lore heavy content and collections more than straight combat.
---
It's more complicated than that -- there's a history between these 3 countries that can make blending together their cultures particularly hurtful. Not to get too heavy but check out Unit 731 and the Nanjing Massacre. Many of these atrocities were never apologized for so I can see why Asian fans were upset by the blending of their cultures, as much as I love the Canthan expansion.
---
I totally think they could bring back Cantha in a way that avoids hurt feelings, though. I'm sure they have Asian developers on board now that can offer insight and direction. Let's hope they'll bring that region of the world back 'cause it's my favorite to this day
---
honestly not really happy about clearing raids on first day, but if they stick to cm's and design the last boss more "in your face", like they do, i can live with it.

The post they got heated about wasn't mocking them at all. It was asking them why they haven't done anything to fix their lore problem and illustrating a possible reason why ANet hasn't done anything about the lore themselves. I thought it was pretty obvious, but maybe not.

And I posted mine. But yet I was the one who had to calm down. Even though I even said I think it should be hideable (which you should like since you think it's ugly).

I would normally mention how you're not my mom and you can't tell me what to do. But seriously. Fuck you :)

Top guilds in, say, WoW, require hundreds of attempts over multiple 12-hour days of no-life raiding to down hard mode for bosses.

"Behold the subtle and elegant waving of my delicate hand a mere instant before I Hadouken the ever-living crap out of your face with a half-ton ball of concentrated bloodstone as the battlefield is inundated with torrents of poison rain, the very air around us spontaneously combusts in gaudy scarlet flames, the ground underneath us is engulfed in corruption, and a dozen mesmer clones and mirrors flurry and shatter around us. It will be the last thing you may or may not ever see. Something something souls of the unbelievers."

Also I did not mention your mom, I said **you** are not **my** mom.

And I'm only unpleasant because you're an unpleasant little troll, if this behaviour bothers you, start with changing your ways.

Is that per type or in total?

If it was per type that seems decent.
---
If it is in total then I am not sure.
---
Ok thanks everyone from the feedback! I’ll take them all in. I guess 100+ hours at max level wasn’t enough for one mount. I’ll continue do work on them every now and then. Until then I’ll just be jealous of all the skyscales I see. I guess the frustrating thing is that I put in a lot of hours to complete all the collections and the timegates and now I hit this wall... it’s all fun though thank you all again :)
---
Sorry but that's just really fucking rude. I'm confused how you got that impression of me as I am very much not a hardcore player.
---
If you buy Living World Season 2 and play through it before starting Heart of Thorns - which you should, honestly - you'll learn some important stuff about the hostile dragons. Stuff that will continue to be relevant all the way until the most recent story episodes.
---
And since you finished Core, I guess you already watched the "Scarlet's War" video in Lion's Arch. It's *really* inadequate. Set aside a few hours and watch Living World Season 1 properly, courtesy of a *whole lot* of players who worked together to archive the events of Scarlet Briar's attack on Tyria for the rest of us who would never be able to experience them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d17gwV4vXOg
---
It will also help prevent the confusion of "who are these people and why are they calling me Boss?" that sets in during Season 2 and onward.
---
I'd very much like to move away from living story for the simple fact that Anet just aren't very good at designing open world maps that attract players because they're fun and rewarding. No one played HoT maps when that released, and they ended up having to go back and buff every meta. Same with PoF, it took them almost 2 years to actually buff the metas so that they were rewarding to play.

From LS3, bloodstone fen, ember bay, draconis mons, and siren's landing just aren't played, lake doric has some population very now and then when leather farming becomes popular 1 day every 3 months; the only map that is kinda played frequently is bitterfrost, and only because people are grinding for trinkets. Same issues with LS4 - Istan ~~is~~ was farmed for gold, and that's...it really. Granted, the recent Dragonfall map is great and Anet really outdid themselves, but I'm not convinced that creating a new map every 3 months, but not putting in the effort to give it replayability, is the best model.
---
This is **aammaazziinngg**
---
Nothing new since aurora and vision are pink ish in hue.
---
Things will never suit everyone's taste, would be best if it was dyeable and hideable. But I'll take being able to hide it since dying would probably be a huge undertaking by this point.
---
&gt; I guess hairstyle kit doesn't sell as well as mount skins and gliders.
---
psh you should see my purchase history.
---
Makeover Kits are like crack
---
The black blob is disappointing.
---
Jesus, just let people enjoy things. 
---
There's no need to be a condescending tool about something just because it doesn't suit your tastes.
---
Trinkets (i.e. not backpiece) do not have skins. They have stated already that Aurora (and now Vision) do not work off of skins.
---
It is not impossible that they could change this, or may even be working on it right now. But the relevant question is, does the minor inconvenience of it not matching your outfit really justify significant reworking of a system that is not technically broken?
---
Not really surprised since the "PoF era" just ended with that last episode. Every issue proposed in Path of Fire has been dealt with.
---
From here on out it will most-likely be preluding toward expansion 3.
---
I suppose living world season 2 is set between season 1 and Hot?
---
Also, about that Scarletts thing, should I just ignore it?
---
I put in a ticket last Friday because I want to go back and only got the automated response so far. Is there a reason for the influx of players? My timing is totally co-incidental and all i need to have them do it remove the Authentictaor which is on a long dead phone.
---
Nothing really changed. Still a lot of focus on a mediocre story, hand-out achievements and overall easy mode content. If you enjoy that, welcome back... the gw2 world is your oyster, all gamemodes are equally interesting then.
---
Personally, the easy mode content anet produced since LS3 bores me to tears, so Im only there for 4 hours each week to raid with my static.
---
Are you really nitpicking on a weak-ass photoshop of two artworks from the original game? And I thought I had high standards...
---
When you stop and think about how much money 2000 gems actually is, especially for a single mount skin, it's not surprising that the skins at that price level rely on "Holy shit, compared to the other skins, that's amazing" in order to generate sales.
---
Yes you do get that. It might not be quite so relevant, but as far as a I know, the raid is still there, the quests are still there and the cinematic to view who the "burning guy in the ice chair" is still there.
---
*At the time*, the story progression was great and worked incredibly well. However, things move on and all MMOs suffer from that, not just WoW. Guild Wars 2 is arguably just as bad - who cares about Xera when you not only need to buy the expansion but also multiple LS episodes for it to make sense?
---
while that's a fair critisism, i don't think that's the fault of LW and making every map "infinitely replayable" (and let's be fair that is what ppl are actually complaining when they say "fun and rewarding") is just an unreasonable demand for any game.
---
Did we just go full Game of Thrones logic here? The story has dragons therefor nothing needs to make sense?
---
And it is for sure Asura and Sylvaries turn. I mean Sylvari desperatly need faces, The female one even more desperatatly and so does Sylvari.
---
i'm struggling to digest all the content. There's way too many maps now and i'm falling way behind on AP and collections.
---
I will note that you will hear talk about how annoying the acquisition of the Skyscale is too (new mount). It's not meant to complete in a day. Just enjoy the collection of it and it does require you to go back to some older maps for map currencies. Welcome back by the way!
---
It's total score for those time zone.
---
Anet lessened the lengths of them, but the Skyscale collection still has hard time gates if that's what you're asking.
---
I thought we were going to get some kind of necromantic aura because of the precursor icon and first PoF raid wing. So disappointing...
---
if they did this then people would complain that they cant keep a specific version with multiple trinkets equipped. The design is essentially 4 precursors (assuming they add an amulet) leading to the actual legendary which is the completed set
---
its like complaining that the legend experiment skin looks bad
---
Always yours
---
It wouldn't be a problem at all if we could dye said ball though :)
---
Farm the mounts, map completion, WvW...
---
Hard? No. Time gated? Yes. They reduced the hours on the time gated portion to be able to finish it in a day for that section. Mind you, you still have to grind out map currencies of some of the most recently added maps. Like Kralk ore, Diodrite ore, etc. -correction- if you deem collecting map materials as hard, then I guess you can quote it as hard. Although I'd say it's more time consuming than hard. You can farm map hearts with multiple characters to speed it up.
---
YES!
---
Wow. Pugs suck. What a surprise.
---
You gotta join a pug with at least some LI requirements and with voice chat. You can't do progression with pugs who most likely joined to see the raid and fuck off.
---
You're right, not every map does need to be fun and rewarding, but when you release 6 new maps, each 3-4 months apart, and 4 are dead within 2 weeks, that's far from good design.
---
I want decent long hair options for men and more than two faces that are actually attractive, but I'm not holding my breath. :(
---
And so, the Skyscale Cashcow Empire begins.
---
Its been brought up in the stickied bug thread by multiple people.
---
Don't think its intended, but seems to be affect world bosses and raid bosses.  I've seen it myself as well since patch day and its a bit annoying.
---
It’ll probably be a lame outfit.
---
I agree, I would like to see more elite specs / new weapons. I don't know if that means adding elite specs more often or possibly adding new weapons to core classes. A couple years wait for another elite spec is to long for me.
---
&gt;They reduced the hours on the time gated portion to be able to finish it in a day for that section.
---
There's still also a later feeding section that's a hard 3 day time gate.
---
if you look at that profile, i think fries are not enough. he should open a mine and sell it.
---
Really disappointing.  I don't like the stacking with Aurora and Vision, since raids should be their own thing, with their own unique rewards, but if the stacking visuals is Anet's solution to potentially conflicting auras/effects on legendary trinkets, then they should have *at least* had the solo Coalescence effect be different than Aurora/Vision.  
---
Have Coalescence be a black, oily, dripping ball that hovers above the character's head, then with one of the other legendary trinkets, it envelops the black mass, then the third trinket adds the orbiting spheres.  The way it is now just screams laziness, and is really lackluster, especially given that the first set of raids awarded the components for a full legendary armor set.
---
They should just do away with makeover kits and start selling hairstyles which are changeable via wardrobe.
---
Not sure how they could compensate current owners though and the perma contract would still be a problem.
---
Kuunavang skin for skyscale confirmed.
---
 They should do a straight up butterfly one in the future. Full on Mothra.
---
I would love to see raids being related to the main story in some way. I think they wanted to do that with the Forsaken Thicket but then decide to introduce Balthazar who suddenly was a fake Lazarus to lessen the impact of the raids into the main story. I mean the reveal of Lazarus being Balthazar was so sudden and without any hint ( And no. Using fire magic does not count as a hint ) it felt like a last minute change. Raids have overall the best fights in the entire game even if some flaws of the combat systems are showing there and everyone should experience content with high quality content. The story fights we see right now are overall average. Some fights are really good but we also see a good amount of really bad stuff there.
---
Thing is, in order to do that, Anet must do something so that a good amount of their community doesn't get pissed and the raid team needs to be much bigger ( well even if they are not doing it, the raid team needs to be bigger than it is right now. Waiting 9 months to get 3 bosses ( 3 awseome bosses by the way ) is way too long )
---
That's the go-to when trying to defend inconsistencies in a world with anything somewhat fantastical. Sure, this world's physics act in the same way 99% of the time, but there's a goblin in the background so when the designers get lazy and fuck something up you just shrug and say "LOL YOU CAN ACCEPT A GOBLIN BUT NOT THIS?" and you automatically "win".
---
For the record, the last (And only? Unless you count HTDV1) time we've ever gotten new emotes was Episode 1 of Season 3. 
---
That's just shy of 3 years ago.
---
Ah sorry. Hard vs Soft. Not Hard vs Easy.
---
Hard time gate: There's a direct timer you can't get around. Examples include the 2 hour waits between some of the steps, or the 3 days the feeding step takes. There's no fuzziness to it. Just a timer.
---
Soft time gate: Something where there's a time restriction to what you're doing, but it's not as clear cut. Honestly that's not a great description examples would be better. All the map materials. Their method of collection involves diminishing returns that reset each day. You're effectively going to farm the easier sources each day instead of just powering through as much as you can in a single 24 hour period. It's a kind of time gate, but more nebulous and we can't really ascribe a specific time to it. There's still some function of putting effort in to shorten the overall time it takes.
---
Fuck yeah give me more colour and butterflies any day, this bitch loves colours
---
The solution is to add the effects to the wardrobe.  If people prefer the look of a precursor weapon over the legendary, which some do, (there was a thread on that exact topic a couple days ago) then they can spend a transmutation charge to skin their legendary, and get the precursor visual, with the legendary QoL.  The legendary trinkets should be the same.
---
Darn that sucks to hear man. Yeah I think lfg may be tough to find for that purpose. I usually just try to do it with the training guild but as you said it may take a while before a training run starts or be very limited. Is the new raid hard?
---
Incoming bullshit explanation about how "it's different" and why
---
Why not? It's not a switch to turn them off, just to turn the overall quality down.
---
Absolutely. But not everything ingame is dyeable. Dyeing weapons is something Anet had to sacrifice in order to make the trading post work, and since backpacks are also technically weapons, they aren't dyeable either. I'm sure we got something similiar going on with jewelry.
---
What we need is a total rework of the faces system.
---
I love how they reskinned Master Blaster and called it SHINY
---
For world bosses, make sure you turn the character model limit down, and turn off the option that shows all player names. Both of those have large impacts in dense crowds.
---
When will they fix Kessex Hills? Who knows...
---
I’d throw down another 2K gems for that one!
---
here's a thought,  don't buy it if you don't like it
---
Topics and questions that are posted repeatedly are regularly downvoted. Some of them are practically indistinguishable for low-effort content (e. g. screenshot of object that's been in the game since launch), and others are just kind of pointless (e. g. proposals for elite specs, "let's discuss my opinion", "does anyone else think", etc). Most new player inquiries could be handled by searching the sub or reading the wiki. Complaining about downvotes also tends to earn downvotes.
---
These phenomena are not unique to r/GuildWars2.
---
Anyone who buys gems with money is a sucker
---
You are the only one pact commander in lore anyway ;)
---
Wait, how have you played 15 more on the character than you have on your whole account? 😂
---
r/tf2 probably
---
Weapons, Backpacks, Auras, and Infusions still show. It's super annoying.
---
6-7 years ago unless you were involved in internal testing oO  
---
And duct tape... IDK if anything else could possibly be more accutate xD
---
Oh, I didn't know that. I mainly use that setting in WvW and just assumed it worked everywhere.
---
Here's one for you. 
---
upvooote
---
Honestly, this post is the classic unpopularinfusion-formula.
---
I'm still wondering where the Pale Tree and the Sylvari fit into all this. The Pale Tree, like Glint, is a child of an Elder Dragon, freed from that dragon's influence. Specifically, it's implied that she's a purified/freed version of a Blighting Tree. The Sylvari are, like Aurene, the grandchildren of an Elder Dragon. I don't think the Sylvari could ascend to BECOME a Dragon like Aurene did, but I'm wondering if they as a *whole* could take part in the magic recycling efforts. Like... working together as a linked network, kinda like how Moredremoth was the ENTIRE Maguuma jungle. 
---
And in fact, like... remember the Unchained in Siren's Landing? There's even a pair of Sylvari trying to "rehabilitate" the Risen (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Weaken_the_undead_so_Scholar_Anka_can_capture_them). Though it doesn't go very well for them. Even so... IF there's a way to rehabilitate the Unchained Risen, perhaps they, too, could act in such a way. 
---
TBH, I was already thinking that Season 5 will be less about fighting a war, and more about cleanup and recovery efforts. I'm hoping we can go back to a kind of dynamic Living World where some maps change a bit, but in a way that's like... we're going to clean up and repair the damage done during this war against the Dragons. I think that'd be a nice change of pace from the constant fighting.
---
*edit* Yeah, on further thought, the whole cleansing of the Brandstorm... I really think this season will be about *cleanup*. And I'm hoping this might mean returning to some older LS maps... idk.
---
Agree. And replies like his get upvoted. Good job Canthros! You got my upvote.
---
The answer to your actual question: because likely when they coded those options in, auras/effects were not a thing, so when they became a thing, they didn't get automatically included.
---
The answer to what you imply with your question: because ANet believes it's not much of a priority, likely according to their data, or that it's so deep into the legacy spaghetti code that they don't think it's worth the consequences.
---
mind the facial hair :)
---
Want. To. Buy.
---
And plenty of non whales do too. While there are probably whales that don't. The issue seems to be that you don't (which is fine) and your comment comes off as arrogant towards people who enjoy the skin (which again are not just whales).
---
&gt;Enjoy the gameplay and story, not the lack of 12 paint stains around a fantasy world.
---
I can easily do both.
---
&gt;Grow up.
---
Pot, kettle.

the ads are displayed depending on what you are searching on google/youtube and which websites you visit.
---
You look for something on amazon, you get the ads for that, you search for something on youtube and you will get recommendations and ads for that as well.
---
This is called "targeted advertisement" and whenever you do anything on any website your browser will save those things which will be read by those advertisement companies.
---
So if you look for something that might embarrass you, you shouldn't do that in a regular browser session.
---
Gotta pray to NCSoft for that one, they're the ones who put the kabosh on Cantha coming to GW2
---
They started showing the game at trade shows in 2010 or 2011 iirc. The jank was apparent at the time. It was definitely there when I was doing closed betas early 2012
---
This is quite a long way to take an example that doesn't really work as evidenced by you already moving the goal posts on your definition of "not there" but chatting is fun so whatever. 
---
Everything in an MMO progresses onwards, if the game is alive. The content becomes antiquated - either by story or gear - and that is a weakness faced by all games, from WoW to GW2. The way to avoid that is to either force those raids to be essential to progress into new expansions, as FFXIV did, or you accept that things move on. If you do the latter, and want to have main story content in raids - as Anet originally did - then you may as well use raids to their fullest to make sure the story points are impactful. I'm sure we'd have been less annoyed with Joko's death if he was fought as a challenging boss within a raid setting.
---
Monetization behind LS is absolutely relevant, particularly if you want to discuss your perceived limiting issues in WoW. It is only fair then to consider the messed up manner of the GW2 story. Which it is given that you can do PoF before HoT and LS4 before LS3 or LS2 - as in your book analogy. None of that helps story telling and is very similar to the issues you are trying to raise with WoW, while handly ignoring my actual point which is that raids can be a huge boon to telling the *current* story.
---
As an aside, it is ironic that your book analogy perfectly describes both the reliance of Guild Wars 2 on lore that was important in Guild Wars 1 and not fully addressed in GW2 (that would be your Latin) and the Living Story model where you can be on "book 2", come back after a bit, find that you've now moved on to "book 5" with the associated current events occurring across the game world and you now need to go out of your way to request and pay for "book 3" and "book 4" to make sense of where the story has gotten up to. 
---
Who the fuck is Aurene after all if you don't play LS2, HoT, LS3 because you got PoF cause that is the new one, right? And has mounts that help with that other older and harder expansion. And why the fuck do we care about the prophecies of some dragon from GW1 and her brother, what has that got to do with the burny people? Wait, aren't dragons supposed to be evil? Oh. You need to read a book about the events before Guild Wars 2 and after Guild Wars 1 (but not the ones about the other important things!) to better understand this. And if you want to understand how that big dragon snake of plant bits got awoken? Tough. That content isn't even in the game anymore. 
---
Guild Wars 2 is far, far from immune of the example of problems in MMO story telling that you've used. It isn't related to raids or their use as a device to better frame and deliver a story. 
---
Your final point isn't really touching upon the subject of this conversation - can raids be used as an effective story telling device - as Anet has *already* included major plot beats in raids. For what it is worth, I agree with you that it should be side stories. I even think tying it into the Mystic Forge is too much of a main story beat considering its presence in the world. However, Anet have chosen the path they want to go down so they may as well move major story points into raids, make better use of resources and introduce variable difficulties so people have more content to do and a reason to stick with the game. The variable difficulties is essential if Anet want to be successful in using raids as a storytelling device.
---
Do we know for a fact that aura affects have a material impact on fps?
---
I've seen this topic over and over with almost the exact same wording and I think I know who's behind this: get over with it. Nothing is toxic about downvoting.
---
Questions almost always get answered (nicely) and ideas discussed. Some ideas just aren't interesting enough for people to actually **upvote** them, how about that? If nobody upvotes, downvotes from the few that do weight more.
---
&gt; It won't hurt you to let them voice their thoughts and just move on.
---
People can freely voice their thoughts, just because they don't generate upvotes doesn't mean there is some kind of "oppression" in this sub, like what the hell?
---
You don't need to hide behind a throwaway, karma is just some internet points with no importance or meaning - embrace the downvotes like a champ and move on.
---
Sadly it doesnt :(
---
It still lags even after loading. It's just pretty strong when it's loading. Thanks.
---
Eh, I'm gonna need a source on that, because I remember being surprised that we were getting an expansion and doubly surprised that it was coming that soon.
---
I don't know... I even have an alt and I'm doing keyruns 
---
Maybe they count the time of my pet, I'm on ranger most of the time
---
The ending cutscene kind of seems like it can be tied into the LS, but I think it's really just an isolated event that mostly pertains to the Djinn and offers some sort of happy ending to that raid two-parter. And since we are most likely leaving Elona with S5, I doubt there will be any callbacks.
---
its been a week they still dont fix this i really hope they actually give us something in return of it
---
If I've already been playing the game forever and got the box the Krytan Jerkin came from, is there an easy way to get it now?
---
At least legendary armor can be transmuted if you don't like the look, I just want stat swap trinkets and don't really like any of the effects.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6sO5B06n1Y  NOSTALGIZE HARDER
---
I NOSTALGIAZZ'ED ALL OVER
---
Well you can start over on your already existing account? A brand new account could be a bit too much in my opinion.
---
Btw the image link seems to be blank
---
Also my specs are a bit lower than you except I have 16GB ram. While I can drop to single digit FPS that is usually at events like reset ley line anomaly or svanir shaman world boss
---
Yeah we've just had a human expansion, we haven't had a Charr map since launch.
---
Start a free to play account. I have one. Got a character to 80. But went back to my main account due to the lack of convenience items, like you noted. But it was fun for awhile.
---
those are rookie numbers
---
Additionally, this is further corroborated by the portable gaeting crystal exchange being released this wing, too. I can’t imagine that they would release that and then another gaeting crystal wing afterwards.
---
we ran with one on our clear last night
---
scourge is just so much safer/easier though, plus epi comes in handy for the last phase
---
well... I'm a rookie you know? :D
---
I can beat that. I only ever create one character in MMOs. Not even joking.
---
Plus you have the option of playing on the other region, or if you want it in the same region, another server for wvw.
---
There are definitely more efficient ways of kiting the pylons. However, the boss isn't a DPS check and you have more than enough time to get someone else to collect the orbs. We used a Minstrel FB, HK Rev, and a Harrier druid just to make sure no one would die while kiting and risk the run. This isn't the best way to do it, just the safest.
---
just joking glad you're having fun
---
This is what happened to me when raids were first released. I stick around as the group loses more and more players. People don't seem to understand that abandoning a group because it's losing players is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
---
Would you mind creating a side by side picture comparison of the new skin (with wings out) with default model?
---
The 2k gem skins have almost always have been "above the standard" and changes the base form of the mount in some way, more than a reskin.
---
For Raptor you have the Dreadnought and the Resplendent Avialan
---
Springer has the Summit Wildhorn and Sun Temple Gecko
---
Skimmer has the Umbral Demon and Magnificent Hummingbird
---
Jackal's are the Reforged Warhound and Shrine Guardian
---
Beetle's  the Tremor Armadillo (doesnt have a 2nd one yet)
---
Warclaw doesn't count because it went the way of 1 pack of four skins for 2k instead
---
Griffon has the Grand Lion and Night fang...
---
and now we have Skyscale with the Shimmerwing.
---
I think as they go they have all gotten better, which is natural. They have an idea of what sells, what people like, and what they as creators are better able to do with skins now.
---
That sounds pretty sick, maybe my next char is gonna get a new experience
---
I didn't. I didn't actually die, but I moved 7,000 miles across the world and couldn't play for a while haha. I think I made it to about 50 before then.
---
I'd like to do it again, actually.
---
Sadly it's one of those grueling issues that we can only speculate and/or complain about. Hope we can get enough upvotes to stay visible for more than an hour. And then I hope Anet actually pays attetion.
---
Each wing is its own finger.
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...
---
Buut due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week).

I argue what it is designed towards not what kind of people will like it exclusively. Hard to understand concept.
---
just finish one and go to the next one?
---
I'm going for the next char once my power soulbeast is full ascended, has full mapcomp and 150 +5 stat AR.
---
After that I want to train my Mirage to have a condi spec and to add raids after hitting fractal level 100 with soulbeast.
---
Set yourself some goals and go for it :)

Dear lord the man had a family
---
Definitely reasonable for posts to be downvoted. This sub does have an issue with comment downvoting, though, which is more obnoxious since it can put new users on the sub into negatives quickly.
---
thanks, didnt notice there was another setup for the lynx build. Krait runes on that makes sense so i guess i'll go with those.
---
That's like comparing nailing a hook to hang a picture to replacing the doors in your house. Both take time and effort, but you can't even begin to compare the amount of time and effort required for each.
---
Tweaking a small map detail takes less time time than improving graphics, creating more story or improving gameplay.
---
Some things that take little time can be done while the artists in charge of the map are waiting between tasks.
---
[That's why they had the time to adjust the revealed areas in Jahai.](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/56766/game-update-notes-october-2-2018)
---
They did it before. They can do it again.
---
thanks
---
Actually i wish it was a griffon skin...Right, it sounds stupid to call it griffon at that point, but IMO it should be a speedster rather than a helicopter.
---
You mean you dont enjoy a nicely cut piece of rock in your map?!
---
But seriously tho, the map needs to feel more organic when you zoom out. I doubt there will be a new map next to this, so just make some blurred changes and not make it seem so jarring
---
Edit: There are a lot of cunts being downvoted here...
---
It isn't purple/pink if you use the right dyes. Albeit A LOT of dyes turn pink but you can turn the "shimmer" off using Medium Shaders.
---
Just an FYI.
---
maybe the next legendary ring and Legendary amulet will make the black blob form into something.
---
If that is their plan, then each trinket should have a pretty significantly reduced cost imo.  They probably didn't even think to do this until the past couple months after they had already locked the crafting cost of aurora in.
---
I've gotten 11 today, so don't think that's it
---
I only got 6 and mine didn't spawn on Jungle Wurm.
---
Someone who made several posts in row about posts getting downvoted while ignoring the fact that there is not a single post in this sub that gets left uncommented.
---
I meant they prob didnt sell well after adding additional hairstyles, hence why we dont get more.
---
Have done mutilple of the same boss before reset? Cus I wasn't sure if you could mine the same one mutilple times
---
Exactly, it's like you need to make connections with people in an mmo... Over time people leave and that sucks but there's still a lot more people to find, you make these connections and one day they look at their friends list and say "hey wanna come do XYZ? we need 1 more" and there you make more new friends who raid and can invite you to a static maybe. Or make your own.
---
I'd love to get a bajillion of new weapons, all of them low-effort reskins of already existing ones, simply because they can be produced for cheap by Anet and provide us with a plethora of additional options and choices. Not everything has to be ultra high quality sparkle.
---
I think for now I'm going to remake my main character but still keep everything I have. Can always change my mind later. I just have too much stuff to lose by doing another account.
---
Honestly just hide the banner icons from other players, who the flux cares how long I have left for my harvest bonus.
---
Not being able to dye shit has more often than not technical reasons. But not being able to toggle the effect, yes, that fucking sucks and needs to be fixed ASAP. Considering that Anet didn't give a shit about that since Aurora however, I very much doubt we'll ever see that option being implemented.
---
I used Blood Is Power, Epidemic, Sand Swell, and Flesh Golem
---
You can run offhand Warhorn (swap) for more CC power (particularly for the adds) but between Golem, Torch 5, Scepter 2, and F4 it should be fine
---
Here's why it's different: European countries get along better than Asian countries. 
---
That's pretty much it.
---
Yeah, it's a fandom thing in general. People take things as personal attacks. For some people you can't like a thing and also have a criticism about things. And yeah, the Skyscale collection is another great example. I do like most of the actual content parts of it, but if I ask on the subreddit what the actual positive benefit of the hard time gate portions of it are, some people just lose their minds. Even the responses from people being reasonable about the whole thing just amount to it's good because it's not *that bad*.
---
No, pretty sure you just get one node per boss - but to be honest, haven't tested it out personally. I did try SB twice, but it was because it bugged out for me the first time. It didn't show on the second time either.
---
I started gw1 with factions, this is so much nostalgic to me..
---
Super rare drop from the djinn essence thing or 20g + 2000 gaeting crystals from pof raids
---
Not with all dyes! Depending on the hue the iridescence will. Change. Green dyes have a pretty vivid red, and grey dyes have it closer to steel blue.
---
It's a hassle and I agree that you could never make it look "rough" as it's always a very elegant mount in the design, but it is not always purple. I swear
---
Who said it was a fact? Of course it's an opinion. Reddit is full of them.
---
Some things are released so rarely that people can't endure waiting until the skin they expect is finally released.
---
Mount skins and legendary weapons are prime exemples.
---
Grim/shadow, heroic/luminous, fancy/colourful, normal/believable, elemental themed, ridiculous/troll, ...
---
Similar to waiting for an elite specialization with a weapon you would like so you can use the skin you love.
---
If you can wait like a monk, good for you. Expressing their wants increases the chance they get what they want.
---
Because [Arena.net](https://Arena.net) will do what most people seem to want, if enough people ask for it often and it has no downside.
---
That's how we got mounts, they figured a way to make them without the downsides seen in games like WoW.
---
What?
---
Unsure if true, but I’ve heard it includes the time spent in character creation
---
Can also fit colourful sylvaris.
---
It depends on how much info you provided them. I raised a ticket a few weeks ago and had a reply in about 4 days.
---
I'll be your +1
---
Hmm seems it's all pretty bugged up
---
Yes, it was Bifrost, my very first legendary.  I have a habit of not looking ahead to see where the legendary journey will take me.  When I hit the Arah gift needed, I was bummed, but in the end used the dungeon frequenter method.
---
So true dude.
---
All mounts default skins are decent. They're just normal/standard/bland.  
---
They fit without sticking out. It's not a bad thing.
---
Five years ago Anet decided to go with a 10 year old raid system. A raid system, that is now 15 years old. It was old when they introduced it, and it only becomes more archaic as other games innovate on the game mode.
---
Seeing them going with an outdated model with the release of HoT, it was clear from the beginning that there isn't much to be expected from GW2 raids in terms of management decisions. The artwork lore and craftmansship and everything else around them is fantastic though.
---
&gt; If it's dark and gloomy - people want cuter.
---
99% of the skins in the game are shiny and sparkly.
---
I ALMOST didn't buy it, as it looked like it might have been too feminine for me, kinda like that jackal skin with the peacock tail (won't buy that).  But I managed to find a colour scheme for it that didn't make me look like a Disney princess.  So it gets my stamp of approval.  The iridescent insect wings are kinda cool.
---
And then I remembered I was playing a Necromancer.  
---
Just like Exordium, it doesn't mix well with the grim.
---
You can get the essences from the Djinn bags as well by chance.  But if you can do the whole WB rotation every day you have more than enough chances to get enough essences.  As well as the bags can drop the weapons.  
---
There is also a Mystic Forge recipe for converting the essences to others if you need to later as well.
---
The event lasts until the 25th so you have some time.
---
My math could be wrong but I think you need like 12 (saffron, emerald) or 18 (crimson, azure) of each essence in total to make all normal and ultra shiny weapon.
---
Possible? Yes but potentially very expensive.
---
we could have [this](http://www.kekaiart.com/uploads/5/4/7/6/5476798/9517530_orig.jpg) but instead we get [this](https://i.redd.it/dyi2sq2cmmwz.jpg) :(
---
revamp the map art around HoT maps while they're at it..
---
imo there are too many long-hair male options! I would like to see some short hair options for guys that don't look like total douchebag stereotypes!
---
Do you get the mount if you don't already have it?
---
They could just give that thing a vendor value of 1000g so you can throw it away :p
---
Honestly high quality ( except for the actual model/textures, etc. ) can  mean very different things to people. to me the rifle is more high quality than most of the gaudy stuff they released recently.
---
To me, a weapon or armor set that has character to it is way better than one that just screams "MAGIC LOOK PWETTY MAGIC UWU"
---
thanks for proving my point on the whole twat thing
---
waves, curls and victory rolls for females, thats all im saying
---
Are there any other good necromancer builds?
---
Take my downvote!
---
It's likely not a simple reskin, but the skin meant to be the upgraded version of master blaster.
---
Many exotic skins have an 'upgraded' version. For example.
---
* [&amp;CgATAAA=] Ebonblade  -&gt; [&amp;CucSAAA=] Cobalt 
---
* [&amp;CvgSAAA=] Phoenix Talon  -&gt;  [&amp;Cr0SAAA=] Phoenix Reborn 
---
Some are obtained from mystic forge, others from exotic lootbags and rng drops.
---
It would have made sense if the unpolished version was always the drop, and then you would upgrade it in the mystic forge to get the 'shiny' version, but instead they first added one of the versions in the mystic forge, then added the rest as other drops, like in champion bags.
---
Only a few of these skins that are obviously upgrades on each other can be actually be upgraded, like Lidless Eye -&gt; Eye of Rodgort.
---
Shame they didn't make the rest work like that too.
---
Hahahahahah touché
---
Definitely the best way to play with it. Turns a 4v4 into a 3v4 in literally 2 or 3 seconds
---
They're not Bolt footsteps.
---
Can arenanet relase a cantha xpac for fun too?
---
I miss 2012- 2014 gw2. :c
---
Yeah, life force generation is pretty ass in the fight. Basically just doing F5 and then saving a bit to F3 on demand when you need to alleviate some pressure, then F2 in between. It's by no means minmax dps, but the enrage timer is so generous you should not be worrying about that as you get familiar with the encounter.
---
Still as playable as ever in OG Wars
---
I love shiny auras and glowing weapons. A lot! Even I was a bit surprised at the new gigantic purple ball infusion. I was thinking of people who already hated auras and that would be crossing the ultimate line of tasteful and overwhelming haha.
---
I updated the post, the recipe is at the bottom. Good luck!
---
Obviously they have an impact but is it material? Like do we have any factual information on how much fps is impacted? Based on your other response in this thread you're clearly biased
---
So. Legendary mount, last collection item was actually 2000 gems.
---
As someone who plays almost exclusively as a female Sylvari, I say a resounding YES.
---
They appear during the day-time too.
---
Can they actually update the map art dynamicly so it changes to include these islands around the map after ppl have done the first part of episode 6? Because if they just add shit there it might be a spoiler for ppl who havent reached that part in the story yet.
---
Would be awesome if they came on reddit with the title, We made this just for fun... And there it is, Cantha expansion, ready to purchase/download.
---
It’s definitely harder in gw2 because it isn’t as explicitly encouraged, but this is an MMO and things get much better if you actually make friends. I’ve found that players you regularly group with aremuch less likely to rage at you even if you mess up. Compare this to fandoms who have no reason to hold back (even if the community is small and they’ll likely run into you again).
---
So you don't have any real evidence that frame rate is significantly affected. I'm not trying to individually call you out because the whole sub is afflicted with it but this is a classic case of confirmation bias
---
is that the new raid  [Loading](https://imgur.com/bUVY3Vs)  screen
---
Condi Thief
---
don't forget beards, the options are sorely lacking at the moment.
---
Maybe this command uses the API somehow for some reason? IDK.
---
my biggest desire cantha expansion and tengu playable race .´º( &gt; ⌂ &lt;  )º¯\`:
---
Just think of it being a literal dragonfly. Dragon body, fly wings.
---
i'd still be out over 1000g if they did that, i cant remember the exact price but it was definitely over 2 k
---
You should be able to just withdraw unlimited bound replicas of a legendary once you've created it, as long as there's no possible way you could profit from them.
---
They're so expensive that they should have the added convenience of not needing to swap them between characters. Have the replicas be named as such and not included in achievements. They're just there for appearance and stat-swappability.
---
This is the best option imo and what I really hope they implement
---
Well just to make it clear. It's not impossible to clear with pugs. Just minutes ago i finished air and earth cm with full pugs.
---
But now regarding you "static/group" members. Did you just accept everyone into your group without letting them give you prove if what they said? Like cm titles or something? Because some ppl say they are "exp" and have 50li and some say it and have 1k. Imo plyers that already have commited to the last 6 wings will be more likely to stay then ppl that just casualy raid and "want to see the new raid wing" though they won't tell you that.
---
Feels kind of nastolgic for some reason, love it
---
I know right? You would need a much bigger sword to take down a mighty charr. Don't insult me.
---
I see Cantha, I upvote.
---
I knew what it was before I clicked. Was not disappointed.
---
It affects me so I would love those options, yes. That's all the "testing" I need. We're not gonna do the work to convince you. If you got a nice computer then this isn't exactly your battle to fight.
---
It's pretty entitled to think that just because you have an opinion on visuals the developers should spend time and resources building a feature like this. Sometimes you gotta understand that you won't always get what you want
---
As the Owner of said Perma Contract... Yeah, 1k would be a pain. But I'm pretty sure the current system is here to stay.
---
Haha I'm not the one you need to convince. You need to convince the developers and they're going to need a little bit more evidence than "ree I hate infusions". Maybe you should do some more testing
---
I am clearly not the only one who wants such a tickbox. Also fairly sure Anet loses potential costumers. But if they don't want my money, who am I to complain.
---
And fuck off with that patronizing bullshit.
---
You can report bugs without using reddit I think
---
Yeah the ground on this fight is real wonky. My group has resorted to mouse double clicking the skill to cast ground target skills at feet.
---
See, those are the experiences that scare me the most, though. Being the brand new outsider joining a group of people who already know each other and have a set way of doing things is like being the weird new kid at school coming to sit at the popular kids' lunch table. Sure, if you do *really* well, you might impress them and wriggle your way into their social group, but you're going to have to be twice as good as anyone else, because they're going to subconciously, automatically be far more critical of *you* than they will be of anyone who's already in the group. They'll also expect you to do things exactly the way they're used to doing them, without explaining it to you, even though that's not particularly fair -- not because they're bad people, but because that's just how people are (they don't realize you may be used to something else and mentally don't make allowances for that). 
---
Unless they're the most friendly, chill guild of people on the planet -- or an exceptionally skilled guild who is highly critical of their own performances and very aware of the causes of hiccups and wipes -- they're probably going to blame you the instant anything goes wrong, regardless of whether you're at fault or not. It's just human nature.
---
I'm sure this strategy works great for some people, but OP has specifically mentioned being very emotionally stressed by the whole process, and I can't imagine anything more stressful than throwing yourself at the mercy of a group of bros and bro-ettes who are already thick as thieves.
---
&gt; do T4s
---
A bonus event like the one we have now might actually bring me back into fractals.
---
I feel these events are great - the only pitfall ANet has to avoid is *putting them on a constant predictable frequent rotation*; if they ever do that, people will start avoiding that particular activity until it gets back into rotation to maximise profit.
---
Viable in raids, sure.
---
Viable in pugs, not so sure..
---
Sadly not by much
---
It’s pretty empty in there xD I think only the ultimate dominator achievement is there.
---
That’s horrible.....I will never forgive Anet for doing this ugly animation. 
---
P.S. You did great job for making this nice with black&amp;white style :)
---
haha thank you :D
---
No infusion are really great like they are. Its the only items in GW2 that could be use and resell after that. Making them into the Wardrobe would remove this aspect because they have no choose to make it account bound when you unlock it into the wardrobe so you couldnt resell it afterward.
---
It literally doesn't matter, flip a coin.
---
People wanted prestigious rewards. Full set of legendary trinkets will be prestigious as fuck thanks to effort needed to get them all.
---
I had joined a few guild runs and sometimes it was smooth, sometimes not, but I considered them okay, only one instance left a really bad taste in my mouth and that was in W1. I wanted to do my clears on monday so I joined a 250LI w1 fc as a cbs, we one-shot every boss, I did not die or fail a mechanic or a single thing until sabetha, where first wall spawn was bad for cannon 1-3 so I barely missed the platform to jump up, and things got a bit rough but we recovered. I also didn't go for last cannon because I learned in my previous runs to normally focus on dps near end 10-15%. We killed it  and no one said anything, I apologised for first cannon and then I asked "are you going to do w2?", while we were looting the chests up on the way to w2 entrance, and response from one person was something like "haha with you? lol". No one else said anything in next two minutes so I thanked them and left.
---
I killed the earth boss Tuesday night with my guildies. I got one KP they got 3 to 5. so in KP temrs im already behind lol
---
This made me happy. Haha
---
&gt; what happened to "if you have nothing nice to say don't say anything at all"?
---
This sub operates under a different, but similar credo: if you have nothing interesting or relevant to say, don't say anything at all. 
---
Our post volume is pretty low. If pointless fluff posts weren't universally downvoted, we'd be immediately overwhelmed by them, drowning out interesting and thoughtful content. 
---
If you don't want your post downvoted, try posting something interesting or useful instead. It's no one's fault but your own if you get downvoted for posting pointless and trivial wastes of time.
---
Same. I need to try all classes to get a proper feel. I have switched mains like 4-5 times but i have settled on Ele since end of 2014, but I still sometimes just play other chars. Like i did all pof story on Firebrand because i was so much more excited for that spec.
---
They said they *specifically* made a group of people who are "new to raiding" -- aka people who are not going to have any, or have few, LI and probably no CMs. They didn't ask for experienced people, they specifically brought in newbies, and then were surprised when actually inexperienced people show up.
---
/u/jesselavender, if your group is specifically bringing in people who are new to raiding, you have to understand that they may not actually understand what the raid definition of "experienced with my class" means. You're probably going to get people who have mained that class for hundreds or even thousands of hours, but who have never actually learned a flawless DPS rotation because there is literally nowhere in the game outside of raids that demands it except *possibly* high level fractal bosses, which are still a somewhat different beast. These people probably weren't lying to you -- they probably just honestly thought they *were* experienced with their classes, not realizing that raiding and optimal rotations are an entirely different beast. 
---
On top of that, people new to raiding are *never* going to be able to pull off those rotations very well while learning mechanics in the beginning, because it's just too much to process all at once. Even with lots of rotation practice on the golem, trying to get it all down so that you can run it subconsciously while concentrating on mechanics, it's going to take time to be able to pull that off consistently in a real raid situation -- more than one session, certainly. While it's true that people who give up after a handful of wipes in a training group suck (that's something you should have made clear with the group from the beginning -- "hey, we're all new to raids, please realize this is going to take a lot of time and we won't be immediately successful"), IMO you had inappropriate expectations for the group you pulled together. It's exceptionally awful for a commander to specifically bring together a group of newbies, and then complain when the newbies "suck". I sincerely hope you didn't voice that sentiment out loud, because if you did you may have turned those people off from raiding for a long time.
---
2 types of stacking, intensity and duration
---
might stacks intensity (up to 25), this means that each individual application has its own duration (with the timer shown on tooltip hover being the longest duration application)... other things that stack intensity are stability or damaging condis
---
duration stacking effects add the duration of the subsequent applications to the current duration (to a limited number of applications, something like 5? might vary per boon); examples of duration stacking are fury, protection, quickness, blind, immob etc
---
the very few things that dont stack are unique effects (neither boons or condis); stuff like scourges [sadistic searing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sadistic_Searing)... although some unique effects do stack if they say they do; such as [vicious lacerations](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vicious_Lacerations)
---
This is so epic.
---
Jyc Row big fan here :)
---
g2a is not an approved seller by the Lionguard and can lead to trouble if bought from. Just stick with the approved merchants so I don't have to come bail you out, recruit.
---
[Official market](http://buy.guildwars2.com/) | [Approved retailers](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/) | [Why should I avoid these sellers?](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/2yhlw4/key_resellers_and_what_they_mean_for_you/)
---
Good. The game should be about prestige not how much gold you can get. Make all these bs infusions account bound. No more chak eggs selling for 20k (not even sellable in-game). Get rid of rng too, this game needs prestige.
---
I always fall for these for a second
---
Play XIV.
---
The warclaw and the skyscale are not decent, in my opinion. They look like cheap reskins, and I don't like that the game is giving such a bad impression when its overall quality is far above them.
---
Don't buy from G2A; your account may be closed for fraud if you do. As the bot said, only buy from the linked approved retailers for your country.
---
Yeah, not like anything else released in yesterday's patch or anything...
---
Can confirm the jackal one has footsteps too.
---
With the way politics are going don't expect that to change anytime soon.
---
there is NO P2P in gw2. buy once and play for free forever. cosmetics and QoL improvements in gemstore.
---
ONLY use approved sellers located on the gw2 official website. NEVER anyone else. Never buy accounts/used accounts. walmart / best buy are trusted retail
---
Complete the Warbeast armor achievement and get 3 type of selectable stat exotic armor  and points.
---
Just sell them and use [chat codes](https://gw2.ninja/chatcodes) instead. The Cosmic Essences are 50 silver a piece and well worth vendering if you don't care for the infusion.
---
Tend to swap main every 800 hours or so...
---
You don't grind for the precursor armor in PvP. You grind for the upgrade components like ascended shards of glory. The precursor itself can be obtained rather quickly.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
I also used to do that on every other mmos but this one really does incentivize using a lot of diverse alts
---
It is "no pain no gain" situation. Anet do not commit with constant raid releases and gamemode do not grow and die. How convenient, when you can release mount skins instead.
---
And why can't we have both? How does me turning off the infusions on my client limit people in enjoying infusions?
---
What are you even arguing now? Why is this such an issue for you?
---
You haven't played ESO and FFXIV right? 
---
Specially in FFXIV (because ESO's are laugh worthy), raids have tiers. You usually know how the raid boss will act by practicing alone, then you can get into the harder ones where all the meaty rewards are.
---
Ours? The "casual oriented" MMO with no mechanic tutorials assumes players won't need it.
---
What we need is REPEATABLE CMs! They said it will be there with wing5, but here we go again
---
Also. Whole wing with cms was cleared in what? 4 hours? Maaaan, that's not even funny
---
Yeah maps and exploration are by far the main things that interest me in this game and any other. I’m giving S5 a shot but if they drastically decrease my chances to explore places and expand what we have uncovered on our map, my playtime and spending amounts will plummet drastically
---
I don't have a problem with you talking about how much you hate infusions (although it is an incessant circlejerk at this point). I'm pointing out how entitled it is to clamor for the devs to dedicate limited time and resources to something that's subjective. Truth hurts
---
Noth with this, but you can see it with the gw2 discord bot
---
That isn't a Reaper trait that causes Might to boosts stats differently, it's a base Necromancer trait.
---
why does this deserve it's own post?
---
Big mmh.
---
Also fractals
---
I'm not saying LS1 is a model of storytelling, either.
---
Because it takes time and resources for anet to implement a feature like that? There needs to be a better reason than "i don't like the way infusions look" for resources be diverted. I think asura are ugly and annoying. I'm not exactly out here clamoring for an option to convert asura models to standard ones though am I?
---
It's an issue because the anti infusion circle jerk is so toxic and annoying. There was an instance last week where someone said a due job looked like shit because it used an infusion. I don't find infusions tasteful, I don't use them but I understand there are people that enjoy them and don't think an option to hide them is a valuable use of resources.
---
i do in fact play FFXIV, the normal modes from the current expansion (O1-12) are not at all compareable to gw2 raids, and the CM's only have a few things in common with normal modes, therefore you can't at all practice for a Savage by doing normal modes...
---
For example O9-12 you need like 2 pulls without ever having done it before with a complete pug group. But O9S-12S you barely see any Pugs groups in immediate time after release, EVERYONE searches their progression groups way before release. which is my point. Same goes for Primal NM and Extremes respectively.
---
Edit: my point being in both games you 'll have a hard time catching up if you don't prepare, in fact on FFXIV the LFG tool can be limited to  "duty complete" which kinda is the same as KP, getting the first clear is always a struggle, people leave instantly, and everything else this thread describes.
---
Edit2: also GW2 has mechanic tutorials for alot of bosses. VG has preevent with all mechanics,  sabetha pre event has the green bomb platform, in w7 u are being shown the pillars on right boss, and the lil adds and special action key on left boss just to name a few
---
My opinion is that raids should not be puggable. If they are supposed to be the real endgame content, then the content should be difficult enough to require the coordination of an organised team. Pugs are not organised, they're randoms that never have played together. The raids on GW2 are far too simple in design and the fact that so many (potentially the majority) clears are done through the LFG shows a problem to me.
---
OP your situation with insults and ragequits, as bad as it sounds, should be normal for pugging but hear me out I'm not trying to say that people are correct for behaving that way. What I am trying to say is that I don't think that raiding should be possible to just jump in and go casually like you want to be doing, and like so many others are doing. I think that the game needs to have content difficult enough to facilitate a *need* for an organised guild to get together and practice for hours to be able to clear. Right now, it doesn't have that. That's why so many people are doing them the way that you're describing.
---
&gt; So of course.
---
What is that impact, then? 0.2%? 2%? 22%? 80%?
---
Do you have any data, or are you just shutting down legitimate questions with an unsubstantiated guess?
---
And when making that PLEASE make the option for me to turn off min and others infusions as well. Some of them are really really really hard to deal with if you play close to them and espeically in WvW. 
---
It is not that i mind people wanting to have those i totally understand that, but i have a hard time to deal with those that shines to much to a point were i have to move away because they hurt my eyes for real. Please let me have the option to stop that, whilst the players who have them can have them and enjoy them without getting comments for others about it. So give us all the otions we need.
---
From this and the shortbow, we can learn that skritt think grenades are shiny.
---
The jargon is b2p since p2p typically means a subscription
---
Just being anal
---
Indeed they can because in the real world and even "in fiction" fancy colorful non menacing animals are in the top of the food chain. Keep it up.
---
Thank you for your sacrifice to show that, once again, gambling isn’t worth it.
---
Honestly I like everything hahaha. I usually play healers and tanks since they’re always needed, and I love playing wizard-like spellcasters or elemental mages.
---
My first character at launch was a ranger and I have 100% map completion on her. I want to do something different though, and I think I’ve finally settled on either Mesmer or Guardian...
---
I think you went full derp with that kind of argument, we’re talking about a game here.
---
None of you are right. I actually had a real issue this last days in WvW. One guy got a infusion and ofc he want to use it and he should it is faishion and he is happy about it. But for me it hurts my eyes so badly that i actaully have to walk away from him.
---
In WvW i have EVERYTHING on the lowest of all lowest settings. And whilst he is showing as a awful standard looking characters he is still a shiny as hell awful looking character. In WvW this is still showing even on the lowest setting. And in this particular case it is actaully making the shiny worse because with the standard model the character have no other shine so the shine turn in to a yellow shiny aura and this is in World verses World.
---
I made a mesmer last 2k hours into the game and now my main mesmer has 2k hours and my other mesmers have collectively around 1k

---
To use a search engine like yahoo, bing or google will answer this question in seconds.
---
The down voting issue described by the OP is more of a “group think” issue.  
---
I’m generally one of those people that try to make every post an “effort post”.  I put a lot of effort into my posts with detailed reasoning and analysis.  I even try to draw on my past experiences with software development and IT Service Management. 
---
That being said, whenever I’ve made a post on why I don’t like HoT, it gets heavily down-voted.  Whenever I make a post on what ANET does wrong in software development, it gets heavily up-voted.  In all honestly, the up-voting and down-voting has been extremely consistent.  It’s sort have gotten to the point where I can predict which posts get up-voted and which get down-voted based on topic alone.
---
To be fair, this is an issue that most reddit pages suffer from.  For example the Legend of Zelda reddit pages generally down-vote anyone that doesn’t rate Ocarina of Time as their favourite Zelda game.  In an attempt to combat this, the True Zelda reddit page literally a sticky thread that basically says “it ok to have a different opinion”.  
---
It’s probably worth mentioning that from a software development perspective, the game is continuously changing.  If a new user asks a question, there’s a good chance the answer in a previous thread with the answer might be out of date or misleading due to a change in the code.  A good example of this would be the recent change to stat selectable gear.  There’s probably hundreds of previous posts that are now out of date due to that system change. 
---
Lastly if someone asks a question, it doesn’t hurt to answer it using the latest information.  You can save that person a lot of time by doing so.  For example I recently hooked up my Top Loader NES to a modern TV.  It’s literally taken me years to do this due to the large amount of out of date or misleading information such as “the only way to hook up Top Loader NES is via a VCR”.  If anyone is curious, you basically need an RF female to RCA phono male adapter, a male to male RF cable and a TV that supports the “ATV format” (basically any TV made in the last few years or earlier).  If your using a Samsung HD TV then there isn’t a button to switch to ATV mode, you have to retune the channels to ATV.

Wow and I thought getting a shiny a weapon from the first cache I opened was nothing special.
---
 
---
I then opened 6 more and got nothing but Luck, so been selling them on TP since.
---
These drop rates really are terrible.

My buddy currently plays a pure 70 Bard in xiv. No other classes unlocked, no DoH/DoL either.

The best thing to do in this game is a variety of content. If you find yourself only doing one kind of content, you will either get really frustrated with the game or play it only occasionally or casually. If you instead, play a variety of content, the game is the game that never stops giving

&gt; **Bug Fixes:**
---
&gt;
---
&gt;* Raid: Adina: Seismic Suffering: "Confusion" was doing more damage than expected on this ability so a change was made to make "Confusion" not do any damage on skill activation.
---
&gt;* Fixed an issue causing the Glyph of Alchemy to reward unexpected materials when equipped to the Unbound Magic Mining Beam or Unbound Magic Harvesting Blast gathering tools.

I wish this was real...

There's a lot of fun to be had in pvp. If that's what he enjoys maybe encourage pvp play instead of introducing him to all the hate?

Wauw, that looks beautiful and it is perfect for my Silvari Mesmer.

Looks better indeed. I can't get over how stupid the rectangle in the ocean looks.

ITT: People flexing their hours played on this dude
---
Jokes aside, I'm kinda similar, but for some reason not with this game, this is one of the only games I have a fairly reasonable dispersion of hours between chars.

Need a help cub? [Check out this while waiting](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/343/account-support-helping-us-help-you#latest)
---
Seems like im lucky, i can queue pvp again. So a bit of waiting did the trick, although there might be other players in that match that reported to support. Who knows. I don't care, i can play pvp again :D
---
Wait they dont? I'm not a raider but I assumed there was some story or stuff there I'm missing lol
---
Try to join party with someone and that guy triggers new queue. You need to accept it -&gt; now you can cancel and are free.
---
If that won't work, you need devs to help you (easiest is on forum or directly ticket)
---
Let me know if you're still looking for help, more than happy to run people through to get the first mount.

The three East Asian countries got a love-hate relationship for cultural, historical, and political reasons (depends on the individual, as you totally have weebs in Korea and China while you have people who would refuse having anything to do with Japan). 
---
Having Japan attack and conquer them was a huge blow to Chinese and Korean pride, before that time they were seen as lower civilized people and pirates. They weren't dismantled and forced to really apologize like Germany had to (the same political party is still in power); they did apologize a few times, but there is always a high ranking politician ruining things (publicly saying it wasn't like that, or going to Yakusuni Shrine), or paid a repair fee/donation (but the funds were often used by the government and not given to direct victims).

actually, there are aspects of your point I agree with. The daily system, for example, kind of puts a soft limit on how much it's worth your while to actually play the game. Fractals, for instance, don't really have much of a reason to be played more than 3 times a day, which can be frustrating if you actually wanna just take a day to sit down and no-life fractals with some friends for that day, or even play fractals for 2 hours rather than 1. Now, you *could* play fractals all day, if you wanted, but for most of us, it's just not attractive enough to do that. A system *designed* to get you coming in and playing, kind of has the opposite effect. It kind of depends on whether you see the daily chests as critical to the reward structure, or just as a bonus thing.
---
That said, I point back to my earlier point in a previous comment: This is why the game is better played as a variety game, than specifically attempting to only play one kind of content. This is a game that has massive quantity of content in a diverse amounts of modes. Fractals, raids, casual exploration, adventures, races, meta events, achievement quests, story, pvp, and wvw. If you play all of them, you're basically never bored.
---
HOWEVER, all this is kind of beside the point of the OP. The events they were talking about weren't time gated or have some sort of limit on them. In fact, if I recall correctly, the events were LIFTING limits from the content they were associated with. So, if you were inclined, you could play the content as much as you'd like and get rewarded.
