---
anyone know where this is in NYC??
---
I was thinking the same as well. Thank you &lt;3
---
Yes
---

---
*Yes*
---
^(*this pleases me*)
---
Fingers crossed for a release date soon!
---
One of those giant whales from frost gorge sound please!
---
If very few are defending, is it really fair to let them hold onto the objective? Might as well lock objectives to only allow them to flip during peak hours then? 
---
This change won't change very much, it'll just make the taking of objectives less tedious. If a server has 2 people on, they'll lose the objective in the end. It just makes attacks less tedious, and hopefully will draw more aggressive siege fights.
---
Not bad, should say "Nerf Warrior Please", though
---
can you portal me to the zones, too, pls? :o
---
Now i want names for mounts like pets do.
---
100%, if I were to pick the Norn, I would choose the Blacked Out choice so I get to go adventure with some Charr and smack some fools.
---
Had thought he could be a Flame Legion slave, with a crispy-fried face due to torture and other hullabaloo that comes from forges. Hence the mask. The guy would then grow up to believe that his "legend" is different, he doesn't get to go on hunts, he doesn't get to align with an Animal Spirit, but he gets to forge a mean ass hammer and bash every head in. 
---
Every head.
---
Nothing says tank like Norn.
---
Human in term of the body type.
---
Same! For now ill just put on a tin foil hat and watch wooden potatoes.
---
Fashion Police? This man here.
---
:p I just watched his latest video and he mentioned about only doing patch notes videos for a while.
---
The big collar makes his broad torso much more balanced, big reason why I went with it
---
As a side note, I wish they wouldn't put pure white text on a black background. It really hurts the eyes for lengthy reading sessions. 
---
If you want to tweak this, you'll have to go into the developer tools and adjust some css which will last for that session.
---
All I can say is I had a specific vision based on my previous experience in game marketing and was supported to do what I believed made sense with our incredible marketing team for this amazing game. Working closer with the community, we were able to find our unique style of expanding awareness for GW2.

Thank you for the confirmation! I was planning to WvW today and didn't want to be totally useless or have to switch classes
---
Yes, because it's GMT/UTC. That's 34 minutes ago.
---
Being a collector of Black Lion weapon sets myself, I appreciate the research. :D 
---
They don't seem to have a pattern or logic concerning the sets that get reintroduced. I wonder how or why they pick them. Neither popularity nor market balance seem to factor in that much.
---
why do they use server time on the forums &gt;__&gt;
---
I like it but for skimmer? A hard pass for me
---
Because you're not logged in.
---
Just waiting for people to complain how griffons should have the same mechanic of scaling walls because it has a pay wall so it should be better than something anyone can get (assuming that it will be). Any day now
---
It's a new big marketing campaign to repopulate the game.  
---
It includes even youtube ads like this one  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRIrIR7SNzY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRIrIR7SNzY) .
---
forums too confusing @__@ real help is in the reddit comments
---
Yeah its actually becoming ridiculous.
---
Next update we’ll see big airships with glowing signs advertising the black lion company
---
Only because we got no Green Rose dye
---
I **KNOW!**
---
Also to add to the benefits of having all the episode of a season:  
---
We're in Season 4. Starting with Season 3, we had new maps that let us obtain mats and resources to get access to new events to grind for gold, receipts for new gear stats, and let us be able to craft ascended armor/weapons. Season 3 even has a meta achievement where doing certain achievements for an episode and its map will let you unlock legendary trinkets. We only have 1 so far from season 3, but I am 99% certain with how the meta achievements are similar in Season 4 so far, we might get a legendary trinket that will be obtainable with the conclusion of episode 6 coming up soonish.

OBTUSE RUBBER GOOSE GREEN MOOSE GUAVA JUICE

Honestly I could kinda care less, sure it's a lil disingenuous and manipulative but it's just nice to see this happening.
---
Your charr looks too much like my Iron Legion charr.
---
So choose norn so I can keep my uniqueness.
---
Oh, I misread the earlier comments. I thought it was just about the commenters popping up and immediately getting answers from the Anet account, I didn't notice the part about the OP itself being suspicious.
---
But a hummingbird can hover
---
Your berserker's berserker with runes of the berserker had better be using a berserker's Flames of War to cast the berserker's skill Flames of War, otherwise what's even the point?
---
Fair enough! I appreciate the response, and the change in direction. :)
---
Ah you are the best! Thank you so much
---
&gt; Consumers are smarter than most marketers give them credit for, and they’ll call out any dishonesty and develop negative opinions about a brand as a result.
---
Some will maybe, I personally feel pretty indifferent. It's not like it can be proven either way.
---
But how does it fight the wind?
---
...there are add-ons?
---
You are a genius!

Imagine if they played a version of Fear Not This Night at the end of the epilogue of each big release:
---
* After Zhaitan : Original Sylvari version we all know an love.
---
* After Mordremoth: HoT doesn't have a proper epilogue. It'd be neat if they added a new instance at the end of the last episdo, in which we return to the Itzel village and regroup with survivors, and have a small victory party there. A group of Itzel would play the  version linked here.  
---
* After Balthazar: [2018 dark version](https://soundcloud.com/arenanet/fear-not-this-night-2018).
---
Had a Dhuum kill once where everyone but 1 person was down (bomb explosion) right when he phased at 10%
---
We all thought we'd wipe but then we got rezed back to full health 😀
---
Agreed. Calling it now: due east of Sandswept Isles, about 50% larger, with the big branded patch in the Northeast corner.
---
To be honest, going to Ravnica in GW2 would be something I would absolutely LOVE!
---
I can fly pretty much permanently when I get on mine. Back when I was awful at it, I completed all of Queensdale waypoints with the griffon.
---
It's not shown in the video or talked about in the relevant article, but the helicopter vs jet plane metaphor has me wondering: will the Skyscale have the ability to climb arbitrarily high from level ground, and will it have the ability to hover in midair without forcing horizontal movement? I want both of these things, they were my favorite parts of WoW flying before Blizzard started murdering the ability to fly.

[Here’s an open world Minion Master build.](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Necromancer_-_Power_Minion_Master)
---
Unlock Blood Magic first so you can get the trait to increase passive moving speed while you’re holding a dagger. That’ll make your life easier. 
---
Minion master is fun but if you get tired of your minions aggroing everything under the sun, can swap them out for high damage Wells. You can even trait it so standing in Well skills grants protection, making it even harder for you to die. 
---
As for Elite skill, get the Flesh Golem and it will tank everything for you :)
---
You know why I am rarely east at the vine event? Because whenever I've tried to to do the east pylons I'm either alone or with one or two others. Which frustrates me to no end. Leading me to sometimes check to see what's up and on seeing nobody just going elsewhere.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
West is easiest to find people for in my experience.
---
Ah yes, Anet's wonderful "New player experience", where you need to level up to Lv14 before you get a functioning map.
---
Yup making a handful of mount skins attainable in game is going to bankrupt anet, outstanding logic.
---
Cool!
---
Needs more Asura

---
Am I the only one not excited?
---
On a side note there was once upon a time a sylvari that went through all schools of knowledge at Rata Sum...It didn't end well.........
---
The only content where having a druid is a must is raids.Unless you're planning for that then any healer will do just fine, if not better. Then again apart from raids and fractals a healer isnt much help anywhere....so u could just go with firebrand but not heal stats, just a combination of zerk/diviner (preferably) for nice damage and boon uptime.
---
Every time SB pops just yell "CC! CC, morons!!"
---
Between Queens and Logan
---
That is really cool.
---
Hope I don't sound negative, but I think GW2 should change it's name. In the past if I mentioned Guild Wars 2 people don't know what it is and assume it's a pvp arena battle game.
---
Season 3 was structured very heavily as a bridging season between expansions - pick up the story from post HoT, set up the plot for PoF. They had to contextualise the elder dragon threat with the timeline (which dragons are around, which are active etc) and they had to introduce Balthazar's plot for PoF while developing Aurene's story. They also chose to hide the Kralkatorrik plot (using Jormag and Primordus as red herrings).
---
Season 4 is able to better focus on its own plot because it doesn't directly lead into an expansion.
---
I'm a computah!
---
I went to high school very close to the image on the top right. Mostly local street traffic, but I'm sure it's cheaper ad space than in a busier neighborhood. Granted, a lot of the high schoolers there did go to quickies or the donut shop out of frame during lunch/after school. 
---
LA has way more car traffic than foot traffic though, and outside of hotspots (which this isn't) people usually only  regularly walk around their neighborhood. 
---
I recognize the top right and bottom left images as well, and they're all definitely within the greater Los Angeles area, but I can't place them offhand.
---
technically anet never said anything like "no lake doric". they only ever referred to the unfinished version of it that was in the files for a long time, and that spanned over the northern and western region around DR, and said that they had no plans of finishing and releasing it, which turned out to be true.
---
The problem is though, the current addons are more like overlays anyway. Except ArcDPS.
---
But let's get real, after getting burned out and starting running FFXIV Free Trial, I'm starting to wonder why GW still lacks add-on support or some accessibility options in high-end content. For the least example, even GW1 had enemy castbars, which makes it easier to tell what to expect from the boss. Latest fractals and raid are mostly a clusterfuck anyway, and AoE telegraphs alone are not helpful in this mess. The biggest violator is CA, when his arm slam AoE appears, it's already too late and I'm starting hit my face to the ground too much often.
---
Well, thanks. You ain't so bad yourself.
---
What even...
---
The underwater elite spec?
---
I think that’s quite fitting!
---
Where are these, out of curiosity?
---
If Gw2 gonna put up ads in NYC, they should utilize the new video ads on the subway platforms. Show some of the action and mounts on those screens while people wait for the train will be a better way imo.
---
I'm doubtful. First off, we see green in the video, and only branded portals rather than any dragonbrand. While we do see the sea and high cliffs next to it.
---
The deciding feature though is whether Skyscales are native to the new map or not. If so, then it's unlikely to be where humans had established land before, since non-Elder Dragon dragons are, while existent in lore since Prophecies (Bone Dragons), not a very popular thing. Makes me think northern Dajkah or Scavenger's Causeway (yeah there's no green in the later, I know...). Or, though I consider it unlikely given the Elonian flora in the video, northern Woodland Cascades.
---
So I think we may be north of that area. We'll see in a couple weeks no doubt though.
---
Not my cup of tea but it's a really cool idea, hummingbird theme fits the functionality perfectly.
---
When did they ever said no Lake Doric? AFAIK, it was only said that the original Lake Doric map was too incomplete and tricky to finish and publish. What we got was a completely different map, that didn't even fully cover the same areas even, with the same name.
---

Remember you can make a (non-thumb) button shift, so you actually have 24 side buttons.

I don’t know if you’re implying I was planted by AN or what, but I just work at a small local agency. More than anything, I was curious about what marketing strategies they implemented for a national campaign, especially one for a game. It’s interesting to me!
---
As a new player I really used to love seeing tags and being invited to groups.
---
HELL NO !
---
We were already chasing after Balthazar since Draconis Mons, though, if it wasn't the Eye, it would be some herald from Elona asking us for help.
---
To have a more interesting transition to the expansion, you would need a different storyline to begin with.
---
3 months would have been today.

---

---
But the SB doesn't have a break bar
---

Based on looks? Norn. Thematic-wise? Charr, although Norn are known to do just whatever they want, so.. why not?

When the guy said you gotta watch out for centaurs I was really hoping he would say that he's fine because he can outrun them
---
Norn still mine and smelt stuff. Badger teaches them to dig and Raven encourages making things.

---
Personally, I feel that power chrono is easy to setup and play in open world. However, if you're going to power chrono in competitive/difficult PvE content that require proper rotation I wouldn't recommend power chrono as the rotation is complex for starter/beginner. In general, power is better than condition in open world as it doesn't have the damage ram up time and mobs dies quickly to burst damage. Mirage is a niche condition dps class that specialise it specific scenario and is especially good at certain raid boss(es) or pvp/wvw roaming. With that said, both chrono and mirage are fine for open world as long as you're playing what you enjoy.  
---
In general, I would recommend doing both HoT and PoF first story to unlock glider and raptor which will help you with exploration.   
---
If you're aiming to gear up for condition mirage, I would recommend playing HoT first for viper gear.
---
&gt; rather than any dragonbrand.

The sky is covered in purple storm just like Vabbi though.

Placing 2 completely identical ads beside each other feels kinda bland though.

Skimmers should move at max speed even on land as long as you are floating above the normal height. That would make me not instantly swap like how I would use roller beetle to go a few hops on the water.

You did it, ANet. You found a way to get me to impulse buy a 2,000 gem mount skin. It's so *perfect.*

A few months ago I actually witnessed a one burn on every lane (if I remember correctly, might have been that one lane needed two tries, but it happened absurdly fast). The whole Meta took about 2 to 3 minutes, truly a once in a lifetime experience. I wish I would have recorded it.
---
That is literally the gag I run with him. I sometimes even take it a step further and go with the reality he isn't actually sneaky, he just scares anyone too shitless to _admit_ they saw him steal something.
---
No, because I open a website which shows ALL major events across the whole game.... for free..
---
Because we have literally one branded weapon skin in the game, and it's a shield.

So people who don't want to track the dailies would have it on their screen because this guy is too lazy to track the dailies?  Keep it the way it is so that the player has the choice of what to track.  
---
It's not hard at reset to select the dailies you're interested in for tracking, and ignore all the other ones.  Or if you're not a slave to dailies, you can track whatever tickles your fancy.
---
It has its ups and downs.
---
Placements (first 10 matches to group you into a Tier) can be pretty rough but after that it gets better.
---
It's definitely not boring and every once in a while you have a truly memorable match but it has some downsides aswell. Like getting used to a new build especially after being placed with a more familiar build can be pretty bad.
---
or, or change it so there is a box you an tick to get the dailies tracked alongside so people can choose themselves.
---
&gt; It's not hard at reset to select the dailies you're interested in for tracking
---
i mean its also not hard to look at dalies being tracked along with chosen achievements, doesn't mean people don't want different things.
---
So you're essentially equating ping causing a macro to fail to a person lacking skill? In other words you genuinely believe that me pressing a single button, which has literally no variation whatsoever in what input is sent from myself through my computer through my client to the server at all under any circumstances, yet the outcome of said button press is unpredictable and varied, is at fault of my own?

Can anyone share some preview of human and sylvari female?

Nope, this new mount adds nothing but the ability to get more money out of the player base. Given the lack of content in this game they should be using resources on that rather than what is nothing but an expensive shiny.

---
Learn what the skills do and why one skill is performed before or after another skill and how they influence or be influenced by trait options, don't learn a series of actions...
---
Yes, that's life. And yes, a person is a lot more than just purpose. And yes, the emotional impact is there. But no, that's often not enough in storytelling. Stories aren't life. 
---
I agree that Aurene's death was a fantastic story *moment*. The story problem is "what comes after". She's not just a main character, her character was built as a plot device. And not just any plot device, the one meant to resolve the main problem the story posed - how to deal with all the magic without having Elder Dragons destroy civilization every now and then. 
---
I am willing to admit the resolution this was building to wasn't particularly brilliant. "Get our own, benevolent dragon" is kind of cheesy, no doubt. But the story never really established the existence of an alternative. The closest we know of are the Bloodstones, but a) we're not really able to construct one, and b) they ultimately failed. And if anyone pulls out of their hat a brand new, working idea, it will feel orders of magnitude cheesier, because it will come out of nowhere. classic deus ex machina.
---
&gt; That heavily implies a natural mixture of environments,
---
And I've yet to see you explain how that mixture is problematic? The way I see it is that you're associating certain visuals to Maguuma like if it couldn't exist anywhere else but that's not true.
---
Desert and palm trees exist in both Dry Top and Crystal Oasis.
---
Environments can be repeated.
---
If this jungle area is underneath some rock structures and close to the water/ocean, it's just a natural formation in my opinion. When I saw the trailer, not once I even thought it was Maguuma, even less illogical. 
---
&gt; But Kralkatorrik isn't at that big purple crater. He's in the Mists. 
---
He is in the Mists mostly, indeed. But as far as I'm aware, he's also free to leave the Mists as much as he want. That's why we fight him in Thunderhead Keep and not in the Mists in All or Nothing after all.
---
Perhaps we'll fight Krakky directly in the mist in the next episode. Perhaps we won't.
---
But Lindsay Murdock confirmed a few times that Living Story maps wouldn't happen in the Mists. First.
---
Secondly, like I pointed out the sky is all-branded and in the teaser there was a few floating rocks. So it need to be close to a branded area at least, unless Anet update the world map art to throw a few branded stuff elsewhere. 
---
Third, the map is very vertical.
---
And fourth, the reason we went to Thunderhead keep was because of the lore behind the area, mainly The Brotherhood of the Dragon. It was extremely organic with the current narrative at the time, gearing up Aurene, glint, and preparing an army. 
---
Personally, it all line up with us finally reaching that mountain summit one way or another for whatever reasons. Given the baobab trees, I still believe we're in Elona and of all areas [currently explored](https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/guide/?v=4&amp;x=-1640.5&amp;y=1086.25&amp;z=1), Sunward Marches and Marga Coast are the only big main maps from mainland Elona that haven't been covered yet and they happen to be not only linked to two blocked paths from Episode 5, *but also* next to that big purple mountain.
---
1+1=2.
---
&gt; Griffons existed there before. 
---
Skree griffin =/= Griffon (mount). I must also point out that [Owl Griffons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Owl_Griffon) have been a thing since launch too. Griffons have existed all around Tyria for a while in many different forms.
---
But as far as the ones we get in Vabbi, they're part of a supposedly secret sanctuary while also being a fantastic/mythological noble creature. In-game description:
---
&gt; Glorious and noble beasts, the art of taming griffons for flight has only been recently recovered.
---
We have this huge scavenger hunt deal giving the impression it's a great creature but the reality here is that we never had any mentions of them as "noble and glorious beasts" prior to PoF.
---
All this to say Anet can very well pull out of their magic hat any justification of their choice for the skyscale.
---
Is it possible for Anet to make this skin also for griffin? I like the skin but I just don't use skimmer at all. Most Raptor and Griffin.
---
WTH man you /wooshed the wrong guy.
---
if you ask me this is a way for have her reseurrect her (she ate palawa joko remember?) and then we will be able to ride her on the last episode of the LS (maybe even the process of acquiring the new mount could involve riding on aurene).
---
Oh no.
---
I usually stack up on 12 slot bags and hand them out to whatever people ask me stuff. Usually I check so they have less than 500 AP though.
---
this is considered ppt again... so ppl that doesnt care about ppl dont care about thatas well. They just want fights and fights are happening during prime hours anyway.
---
That's my guess. It seems like too striking a feature on the map to not go there eventually.
---
Scrapper is based on charr lore so I would go for charr.
---
I would recommend [https://parsecgaming.com/](https://parsecgaming.com/) its free :)
---
A player doesn't need to play every single day, or even every single month to still a player. If they have created an account and done anything in game, they are by definition a player. Guild Wars 2 can easily have 11 million total players, but the "active" player count will obviously be way lower compared to the total amount. That's probably why they went the total user route instead of active. Having 11 total player's is more impactful to a new person looking at  an active number of lets say... 50,000 players on a day, across both EU and NA.
---
Most of the guilds I've been in have been a bit of a bust. Though, I might actually suggest running some WvW and jump in a few zergs. I found a really fun guild that basically talks shit and jokes around the entire time they're not actively fighting or discussing targets. Not sure if it's common for other servers, but most groups I've jumped in have a discord going and will send a guild invite if you ask.
---
I said nothing about player activity.they dont have 11 mil players. They have 11 mil accounts, f2p included.
---
Well it was barely advertised in 2012 so it’s practically new on that front.
---
Doing map completion in low level areas is pretty good way too. I met lot of nice new players who appreciated company/help this way \o/
---
You stay productive for yourself and be helpful to others.
---
they already know that they can get away with ridiculous prices after so many people still buy their loot box keys. that ship has sailed
---
classic krall, misinformation is king
---
I think no, yeah there are some simallar like, it glow.
---
Permafrost too!
---
Sad salad, or maybe a sadlad
---
Thanks, it's working fine now
---
Jep, there is this one guy in my guild that saved ~1000 black lion keys for when the chaos weapon return.
---
Im so happy seeing this! Looking forward to more ads, maybe have them show up on popular gaming websites, or stores even. Cant wait for the new influx of players!
---
&gt; Are you serious? Why do you think QA testers and dev tests exist?
---
In terms of gw2 I doubt they exist. I think they have an intern who checks if new patch can be downloaded and played and they call it a day.
---
Just look at magnificent Kourna release. The same team will now provide us with season finale. I have chills.
---
I wasn't there for other LW release, but I'm wondering if this massive communication (ads, free episodes, "how to return", ...) isn't hiding a full extension instead of LW5.
---
North of Vabbi, there are changes in the map border [-&gt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b5ul0l/undocumented_world_map_change/)
---
Conspiracies !
---
Have you thought about making a crossover event with Monster Hunter or another game? It would be cool imo and it will bring alot of attention to the game
---
Try to use [Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini_Skimmer_Pup_Collection) from time to time. Might help you ;)
---
Wow, much thoughts, very confused.
---
I would finish the story first and explore the world. You can learn the profession by playing it at it's best. Don't think that much and just play the game. That's my advice at least.
---
What are some easy to get symmetrical staff skins fir daredevil?
---
Well, I did actually notice that this guy was a new-ish account who had pretty much only ever commented in this post as well, but I don't think they were a marketing account. I'm not gonna say everyone who has a new account is doing it for commercial reasons. The OP of this thread has many other red flags despite just the account age vs account activity. Also, the guy I was responding to also seems to agree this is a marketing post, and says stunts like this often hurt the brand, which a marketing account wouldn't do. They just wouldn't talk to me.
---
We can only do one Istan per day then go back to Silverwastes. It was nerfed. Heck, do SW 24/7 even with PoF.
---
Anet proudly presents: after a success with WarClaw and ScyScale we are giving you WaterFin!
---
The answer to every question about "which race" will allways be Asura ;-)
---
Which is where is supposed to be wing7 not the story
---
FYI, Margonites are the demons of Abaddon. Basically humans corrupted by Abaddon, á la the Elder Dragon corruption. Iirc, it's unclear if they still exist.
---
what do you mean? They advertised it as guild wars 2, and there are no guild wars anywhere to see. 
---
The whole concept was, to make a sequel to gw1, which they didn't do at all. 
---
No real builds, no guild wars, only cookie cutter classes with no real depth, wvw is a joke compared to rvr of daoc or even warhammer. 
---
For the theme park mmo that it is, the gear/character progression is non existent, it's only skins that you're chasing, which is not enough to keep me hooked personally. 
---
Some people might enjoy it, but I'm having a hard time enjoying any of the content.
---
&gt;Season 5 involves Margonites, the Mists, Space Travel, and all of the cutscenes are musicals.
---
The Commander, Dragon's Watch and the Pact lined up on one side, Kralkatorrik, the Branded and weird alien Mist critters lined up on the other. They slowly advance towards each other while clicking their fingers menacingly a la West Side Story. Music slowly begins to play. The singing starts. This is the true nature of war.
---
The cheeky sneak peek at the next expansion's mastery system: Battle musicals and dance fighting. Anet strikes gold yet again.
---
I am okay with explaining to new people but some of them don't even read the chat.
---
Margonites were Abaddons followers its a joke. You fought them in Nightfall.
---
You drew me in with "invasive tentacles", but left me hanging, waiting for my prescribed dose of asura sexualization that never came
---
How do I go on living now
---
You cant compare a 4min trailer with 40s youtube ads. These clips fulfill an entirely different purpose and while I dont like all of them, I see potential in the new marketing strategy.
---
Mesmer especially Chrono is the most wanted class atleast in PVE. The problem with chrono is: His Equip is expensive af. And statwise is most likely to change again with the next balance patch. Thats why i recommend to get legendary armor asap with him. Otherwise prepare to invest a lot of gold.
---
Characters involved and living through a tragic story scene are sad. Shocking.
---
Scrapper is hella lot fun with the hammer. And your killer drones are awesome!
---
Norn,
---
Deadeye is so upsetting. Ok, you have high dps using d/d, but you totally Fall out the concept of the spec. I guess it's the most failed spec of the game. Daredevil feels so much better.
---
If there were no exalted left, then it would look similar to Kesho.
---
Dagger aa hits 3 mobs
---
They advertised it as the game they showed in all the trailers and previews. Just because the name says "Guild Wars 2" doesn't mean they *have* to put guild wars in there. (even though I wish they would) You got exactly what they showed you and anything else you imagined would be there is your own fantasy.
---
Or GS mesmer to 5
---
What about rifle deadeye?
---
Deadeye is perfect for many WvW and PvP encounters.
---
Especially if it catches people unaware.
---
Chrono main here :
---
First of congratulations on 80!
---
As for what to build on your mesmer it depends on what your aim is. Chronomancer is currently one of the best offensive support that can do decent damage while providing vital boons in PvE environment such as raids and fractals. Your gear for this build takes a bit of time to make and you will need crafting tailor to max. Diviner gear materials are farmed from Lw S4E5 by doing the treasure room at Thunderhead peaks. You need 18 pieces of Jewel which at worst case will take you 6 days. If you open small chests and get lucky then only a few. You can get diviner trinkets from lw s3 maps too which is a big boost as it is far easier.
---
My recommendation for the build is to get all armors diviner 2 rings and 1 accessory diviner with rest of it berserker's along with weapon. You will hit around 85 Boon duration ( rune of pack and concentration sigil included ) which is more than enough for beginner chronomancer. As for your rotations it is quite simple just takes a bit of time to practice and get it right. This build does well in open world too but maybe change some utility skills and traits from time to time.
---
For Mirage: It is easier to do openworld and stories with mirage as they are a dps spec thus making life a little easier. They are also great in PvP and WvW which i sometimes play from time to time but for end game PvE : 
---
Mirages are extinct in Fractals and are a great in SOME BOSSES in raids. So for maining a character i prefer chrono as you will find more people ask for chrono than mirage.
---
aka some of the [greatest](https://wiki.guildwars.com/images/0/0a/%22Margonite%22_concept_art_1.jpg) [designs](https://wiki.guildwars.com/images/d/d0/%22Margonite%22_concept_art_2.jpg) in the original Guild Wars:
---
I am in a PvP guild on one account. Not because I am the great PvPler, but because I helped trio the guild hall quest as random. I would say, do all of that. A guild certainly helps, and they will share tips. But it will be appreciated, when you do your homework, aka watching videos, looking over guides, and builds. A certain amount of pain working your way up in matches comes with the game mode, I guess. And that is another area where a guild is nice. They know your pain, and are on your side regardless. They are more or less casual, so find one that is open for noobs.
---
Did you check out the [gallery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gallery_of_staves)? Many are for gold, or karma.
---
This is something i need to test, thank you for the reminder =)
---
So you're the pug I always kick in my pve groups.
---
Infusions are ONLY relevant for fractals (and the 1% minmax). 
---
For the rest of the game you want ascended for the stats and weapon strength. Agony Infusions are for fractals. Stat infusions give a very tiny amount of stats (+5).
---
&gt; makes one prediction, lists several outcomes to make sure one would come true
---
Do I remember correctly that you can't get all PvP chests if you play unranked? I feelbad for people who actually want to climb ranks. I'm not afking or anything but i'm not that invested in the game mode outside of the rewards
---
Well, maybe. Never been so far south to reach UK ;)
---
I did an oopsie
---
\&gt;saw the skin, bought it instantly
---
\&gt;still have 33 keys saved up for a good chest
---
\&gt;could've gotten it from the chests, now probably wasted 2k gems
---
not my day so far
---
Open the Hook configuration window (default Alt+F2 I believe) and go to the Settings tab. There you will find the option.
---
According to the leaks, no.
---
You dont stop night capping by having absurd defensive measures. 
---
This doesn't suddenly change the effect of population imbalance during inactive times. It does prevent action during active times entirely as the losing side can easily bunker up unless the difference in strength is absurd (as high as during inactive moments).
---
Buffing defense throughout the years hadn't made nightcap any less relevant. It only made pre-prime upgrading more relevant as these structures are almost impossibly to challenge during prime.
---
Holy fuck people *really* hate this. Good video of good scenery.
---
The point of being alive is not being adead.
---
Voice line system like in Paladins would be really great for communications.
---
I've streamed other games to my laptop with steam, but they were all steam games. Some non-steam games work with the in-home streaming, but GW2 is one of the ones which don't.
---
Damn shame no commercial with mr t. Guarantee we can get Felicia Day to "mock" a copy of scripts Mr had on the "what's your game" commercials for wow.
---
Scenes flashing of tequatl and few dragons !
---
Confirmed. couple days ago south stalled on it's third "attempt" while everyone else 2-killed and the octo reset. 5-7 from west went south to find 4 armors spamming attacks on the shielded vine while the squad laid there dead. I had time to run out, get an armor, drag it inside, and fix the blooms while the rest of us who had already killed west killed south too.
---
Maybe jus' A Lil
---
What are you talking about? It happens successfully every day on EU.
---
The state of balance and current meta you can find here:
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki
---
https://snowcrows.com/
---
(probably because everyone hates chak xd at least that's why I never go south)
---
I guess you mean T5 to T6, as I don't know what T7 dust should be. But anyway, https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/spirit-shards should help to decide, if it's worth to convert them.
---
yeah and ? Starting as P/P thief and then been P/P Daredevil. Same build just lower mobility.
---
Loads of people got laid off and the rest of the staff were told “fine, you guys can try out things you were told not to before”.
---
Joke about the last bit idk.
---
east: drop bombs
---
south: knockback or pull the bomb towards the octovine (classes with few or no such skills are kinda useless here)
---
west: turn into mushrooms and run to the octovine to explode. If you run at the right edge of the lane towards the stairs you can avoid the big mordrem that f* you up. 
---
north: grab a weed killer, build a turret thing near the octovine and spray it to death.
---
Imho east is the easiest and westis the most difficult, but north and west can struggle too if people don't know what they are doing.
---
"I thought this was real"
---
Snargle x Portrait crossover comic when.
---
19 Silver for a single chest!? I'm gonna get pretty excited now when i get one from a random moa drop in queensdale now
---
normally id say charr, but this that get up i prefer the norn; though maybe thats just because i know how those shoulders and that coat look in movement on a charr (not good)
---
With so many people doing the events daily in core maps, it'll be harder for them to control the stock.
---
kinda loving this new focus on gw2
---
not OP, but:
---
scrapper helm
---
bladed gloves
---
legs i dont know; but irrelevant
---
and rest is sorrows embrace/forgeman
---
You can start by not giving players you don't trust the right to remove items.
---
A random one is sacrificed each time, but all of them reset. 
---
So the same one may be sacrificed twice in a row.
---
Guild wars has to do with the lire and not guilds in an actual war. Gw1 had it as pvp and it was amazing but it wasn’t because of the name. That dude is just rambling without knowing what he talks about
---
You can get a full breakdown of [what you need for twilight here](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-30704) (If you enter an API key you can have it detect what you already have and what you still need). Once you know what you need you can see what is worth promoting, if it isn't worth promoting then you can sell it. The other major uses for the lower materials (besides guild halls) is legendary armor and season 2 weapons.
---
the collar clipping is much worse on the charr (maybe not in this pose, but actually ingame its going to be a clipfest; especially with those horns)
---
liquour mart and pizza place? Preaching to the choir.
---
Makes sense. This looks more like a case of "gained trust" over a long period of time.
---
This was absolutely me the second I went to DR and saw a line of beautiful birbs
---
More like lower Verdant Brink. Modremoth -wants- Glint's Legacy and all magical artifacts reserved for the activation of Tarir.
---
The cane sets it off.
---
Isn't that.. abusive? Like in my country that would be illegal. Ads can only be placed on dedicated ad spots (billboards, bus stops etc)
---
You can already do this. Just click the little eyeball when the dailies first pop up to track them.
---
You can also rearrange the list in the 'watched' panel to suit your preferences.
---
just found out about the stories that tells the characters thoughts (the one that just had the Zafirah released) and i saw Rytlock's say " " even prophecy was on our side! And then it was over. " 
---
but wasn't the prophecy directly against us? it showed no matter how we challenged kralk Aurene would be killed? didn't prophecy go down exactly as it was shown? or did i misunderstand something?
---
I was wondering about this yesterday as I was trying to get it and it was still 200 gems.
---
You can also rearrange the watch list by clicking and dragging the watched achievements over each other in the list.
---
Exactly, I also agree with you. There are always going to be cunning individuals out there who do bad deeds, nevertheless, I think their guild leaders just want clarification so that they can act immediately instead of letting it go on for months on end.
---
That's a griffon skin if ive ever seen one
---
Mildly amusing, but they certainly wouldn't draw me in esp. if I wasn't already a GW2 player.
---
You don't have to 'find them' though. They pop up on the screen as soon as you log in. All you have to do is click the eye symbol on the dailies you want to do when logging in and they'll be tracked.
---
We know treason can happen even among family members (stolen accounts, items, other), there are plenty of cases. Trust is the most subjective concept, it's always valid, until it isn't.
---
How can one decide who's trustworthy, beyond any doubt ?
---
Regarding the content guide, you can disable it. Options &gt; Content Guide = off
---
Also, something that most ppl don't seem to know, you can swap the location of the party/squad GUI and the chat. You can also move the map from the top right to the bottom right.
---
They can kick said member, that's what I would do at least.
---
How odd.
---
that doesn't mean it wouldn't be a nice quality of life change if it just was on the side where it is when you aren't tracking anything.
---
Maybe there are some who somehow exist but most of them turned into Jackals.
---
I know but it's a pain in the ass to go through each LS zone and super adventure box dailies. Can only see like 8 tracked at a time.
---
Those were Aurene's visions. The prophecy was that Aurene would kill Kralk and take his role of an elder dragon.
---
Yes I know every bit you had metioned. Honestly I just do miss GW1 and EVE-Online UI customization.
---
I'm pretty certain that is the point at which Kralkyboi blasted his way into the Mists. Remember that he's not on Tyria at the moment, per se. So maybe we'll go there, but there's no reason to assume that we need to for any reason.
---
We can already track his location and vitals. No reason to follow the physical trail.
---
[removed]
---
The game died.
---
Dont know if they get kicked or not. I never kicked anyone. And are you sure they are Daredevils or Deadeyes ? There is a diference between those two. Daredevil wasnt used because of Fotm traits as SliperySlope and now when its gone it might be played again. But even then its really hard to play it and survive. Even if you would have been spaming skill 5 on your staff over and over again, one good hit between those jumps and you would be dead again.
---
If there's a record, they'll just do it in one go and leave the guild at the same time, thus removing their name from the records.
---
It's better to have something like a Squad Commander WvW rank with consumable permissions for the guild.
---
Yea like since like Nightfall. But is it released? Like clicking 6 pieces of legendary armor with 20 point drop down to swap stats in 2k19...
---
So my charr is technically riding around on top of what was once a human?
---
I don't know how I feel about this information.
---
I started playing last week and I'm having lots of fun on my Engi running around with a flamethrower &amp; turrets, but I struggle with more complex rotations. Now I've hit 31, I would like to give PvP/WvW a try, but I'm worried that my play type won't be very good and so annoy people I'm grouped with. Is that likely an issue and if so, is there a class with a relatively simple PvP rotation I could use in PvP instead?
---
Mounts.
---
Also, painfully blinding mount skins.
---
WOW that's quality marketing!
---
I've tried to watch it all the way through and I just can't. It's too cringe.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini_Skimmer_Pup_Collection
---
Just one more click and you would have been there.
---
I got very lucky using a few keys that I had sitting in my inventory. Now I'm very smugly flying around the main cities
---
Cheers for the info, I'll pass it on to him and the leaders. Sounds like nasty business if there's not even any trace left behind.
---
What are you on about?
---
Asura, that armor looks really good on them :')
---
This is the part I was really hoping to get some advice with. Thank you!!! I’ll look to implement everything you mentioned here after work. Cheers!
---
I like doing the story first, then the map completion and by doing so, discovering the events of the maps, and if there's a meta. Then, work for the achievements. For the last part, I recently found out that working for these without using any guide at all is way more enjoyable than just going to Dulfy and have a grocery shopping list of locations to go to. Even better if you can work on these with a friend. My best memories of LS maps were actually discovering new maps with some guildies, and then doing the scavenger hunts achievements without guides (Like the heated stones in Ember Bay, that was an adventure!)
---
However, even with that, the content doesn't last for more than 2 weeks (except for the grindiest achievement, like the dragonsblood weapons from the last episode that demanded a LOT of branded masses). So I guess, enjoy it while it lasts, there's no magic formula. Try to make the enjoyable time longer by not spoiling yourself all the things there are to do.
---
the story was better then the HoT story by miles. The maps also dont feel like chore
---
Long before that we got the odd skin drops too. Granted a few were through raids
---
OMG HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS WAS A THING
---
Why did you use it with such cheap unlocks still needed on your account? 
---
Use one of the many API sites to look at how many cheap unlocks you’re missing and buy them all up. It’s nice to have those items always give you something worth at least 10g
---
Daredevil is a very strong power spec in raids, especially the ones with magnetic bomb or consume plasma.
---
Lol yes I'm sure. Staff/staff with Sigil of Energy means you pretty much never run out of dodges. Swap in "Roll for Initiative" for yet another dodge + Initiative boost at the cost of dps. Never had any problems myself and never heard of if somebody getting kicked for it.
---
Deadeye seems less welcome in Fractals with its lack of cleave, but more welcome in certain Raids due to its high single target DPS.
---
Daredevil rotation doesn't use Vault. The "spam" skill is staff 2, which animation locks but doesn't "bounce you around the arena" and the burst is only a few seconds. So you time the burst to not blow yourself up and you'll be fine.
---
&gt; Daredevil with magnetic bomb ? Also if you are talking about stealing that can do even normal thief. Its nothing special for Daredevil .
---
Seeing as how Anet wanted to get away from fantasy stereotypes which long lives kind of is I doubt it I'm afraid.
---
legendary set goes on the chrono, and you'll also want a druid
---
I like these so much more without the unnecessary sexual innuendo.
---
I would have had no objections if they'd been out front about being part of the dev team.  Not that it really matters in the end anyways - I'm not going to drop the game just because of questionable marketing decisions.
---
yeah the problem is that 95% players have problems to time it right. Take the fact that sometimes even the pro players can have delay and even a sec can cost their lifes. The difficutly of playing this it really ... really high. Thats why you mostly not find Thiefs in Fractals in general. Its .. not as easy as is sounds.
---
It's a joke how easy East side is...
---
All the races seem to have roughly similar life spans. The Charr and Humans are very similar, and the Norn are stated to live as long as 120 years making them the longest-living of the playable races. Oola is noted as having lived an exceptionally long life for an asura, of ~120+ years. So their lifespan may be slightly longer than that of Charr or Humans. 
---
No sylvari yet has died of old age so who knows how long they can live.
---
I’ve done it with a group of friends and some could see it, others couldn’t.  Those that could see it, had to have the bug
---
Cool, thanks! There's something about it that doesn't quite capture the cuteness though.
---
I have to agree, this was sorely needed for sometime! They are doing a great job communicating just enough without over-hyping incoming content and still maintaining the mystery of what's actually coming in the story. This is good stuff, bravo!!
---
https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1270906713068019
---
Yeah, I think skimmers with their skill should be compareble speed with jackal with teleports or raptor with jumps. You'd have more choice and still had to swap to other mounts to jump gaps or use sand portals. Skimmer is probably my favourite mount but it's just so useless...
---
Murdock said they were UNLIKELY to put a map in the mists. Not they never will
---
&gt;Does it matter though, even if it is?
---
I haven't passed any judgement about whether it's right or wrong. Just pointing out that this is clearly a paid-for marketing campaign posing as user-generated content.
---
*Does* it matter, though? If I *am* going to take a stance on it, then frankly I would say that the question has already been answered by the fact Anet *did* try to pretend this was a "real" user's post, instead of just having one of the actual Anet accounts post "Hey, try and see if you can spot any of these posters that we've put up!" Shouldn't matter who posted it, right?
---
They just need to have an option to show the dailies for the zone you're in in addition to the achievements you're tracking. I had this problem when I was doing Astralaria - I had the collection tracked but I would have to untrack it if I wanted it to show the dailies/fractals automatically. It's not a huge issue but it would be a nice QoL feature.
---
I'm torn I like what they are doing but I liked how they did it with the season 3 finale. They gave us the trailer first then small teasers for upcoming features. I only think this is good if they are doing elite specs in living world so people can see them in action.
---
Oh, I was wondering what was up with that, I thought I just wasn't away long enough for it or somethin'
---
I think the sword and the greatsword are a fairly good size.  I hate the axe though, I wish it was a hatchet style instead of a battle axe, since it's an offhand weapon on my ranger.  I use the most basic (just 'axe') skin because it feels more like what a woodsman-type ranger would carry.
---
I press F for your wasted unlocks. I'm glad you found it at least!
---
My dream is pretty much to be able to rock legit heavy armor on my Reaper. Any outfits I wear are plate-like, but I'd love to be able to do some more FashionWars with it besides "this outfit yes".
---
The gods of humanity are underwhelming to say the least in the GW franchise. A couple of them tried to screw us (balth, abby) while the rest just give us the finger with one hand and a pat on the back in the other.
---
bo-ring.
---
&gt;But I don't think, given the record, their marketing department thinks that far ahead.
---
Considering they're making an actual effort to change their stance on communication and marketing, maybe they do now?
---
armors takes 10x more time to make,so if they gona do this,its better be something worth while,not like last 50 shitty outfits.
---
Exactly. Them adding more mounts isn't a sensible reason to become "more and more scared for my game's future," as the other person put it.
---
Hello. I'm an old returning players and have a question: Are there no more monthlys? I see that I have daily quests and I can see I received achievement points from monthlys a long time ago but I don't see any current monthly?
---
But...but Edinburgh...is in the UK...
---
I guess you're not a hero then, because you're not a beauty yourself.
---
The numbers are variable, they are taken from the API. That's why I commented replacing them with ??.
---
shouldn't $20+$10 work?
---
Im sorry man, but that is just old BS, plain and simple. Armors already clip, LIKE CRAZY, on nearly all sets, with one another, heck, even within the same set! They are gonna have to come up with a better excuse for that one, because the clipping one stopped holding up about 6 years ago.

Tig ole bitties

Oh wait you mean when we were running 25 against Dusks 35 and Johnny had to call back up from either Sin or KRTA all night? As I recall. The only fights we lost were where we got double and triple teamed. Bar the fight in Hills, where we stomped all three of your shits in...
---
Blasphemy
---
It's looks kinda fat (in game) and I like this one better
---
* Human: 60-80 usually depending on whether they can afford to pay a doctor.
---
* Charr: 60-70, if they don't die in battle or workplace accidents before that.
---
* Norn: 100-120, if they do not manage to kill themselves early doing something stupid.
---
* Asura: 80-100, if they do not kill themselves in a lab freak accident.
---
* Sylvari: Nobody knows.
---
oh no
---
For mount you can just buy key in the game's options if you have the spare keys to do so
---
i just played To Kill A God for the first time last night, and now i see this. This is SOOOOOO TRUE. 
---
but the cooldown, tho...
---
This...I only use my griffon and soon the dragon
---
Thanks everyone for the replies and the links, it's really appreciated :) Will go researching and hopefully have time to start losing this weekend ;)
---
I'm not pretty, I'm deadly!  [https://imgur.com/a/if4sYrZ](https://imgur.com/a/if4sYrZ)
---
It's a skimmer skin
---
Monthlies are gone.
---
As far as the expansion goes there are two possible reasons:
---
1. Revenant, if you want to play one then you need HoT
---
2. If you want a friend to teleport you to get a raptor then grab PoF.
---
All in all I say just wait till 80 to get them unless they go on sale.
---
Ah, okay. :)
---
Thank you.
---
Yep, I feel like I got a terminal disease from seeing that fashion wars.
---
Kalla feels like it covers the summoning spirits for support concept for Revenant.
---
I don't know, between Engineer (all of them), Renegade, and Scourge it feels like we've got most of our bases covered on the functionality of the Ritualist.  Renegade and Scourge even have the placeable spirit concept.  
---
I keep feeling like people want a very very ***very*** specific combination of how they played Ritualist in GW1, which means they likely wouldn't be happy anyway if ArenaNet actually brought it over.
---
Gonna give it to my Renegade.
---
When you use the mystic forge recipe to change the attribute combination on an ascended item then you create a new item which doesn't qualify as the precursor anymore.
---
I did that with pvp armour before it was a precursor and wanted a full set of shards.
---
Well that's just bad design.
---
I am really struggling gearing my chronomancer. I want to do Raids, Fractals and Open World. But it seems every build varies wildly having a mix of berserker's, assassin's and diviner's. Where should I start with Ascended? What should I get first? I have berserkers asc trinkets but am overwhelmed with the options, do I really need a set of each? Would berserker armor be fine and get a mix of trinkets? and what is the easiest way to get diviner's stuff?
---
Sorry for the overwhelming questions, I am overwhelemed. And yes I am a long time player returning, excited for the difficult of chrono and loving playing, but really starting to notice my lack of uptime. 
---
on a side note - I love utility and boon, is it viable to run this playstyle in raid fractals and open world? How much would I need to change. Thanks so much in advance! Love this community and game :D
---
11 mill was reported when PoF launched. There are more now probably.
---
Not really
---
I see that more as an anti-bot feature rather than a 'bug'.
---
No one told you to run three healers.
---
Unintuitive to say the least
---
Ritualist as a Revenant Elite Spec makes sense, but I feel like Renegade fits a lot of themes rather closely what with you summoning spirits of Kayla's warband.
---
If anything I could see Ritualist being a Necromancer Elite Spec what with both having strong ties with death, only each handles it differently.
---
Granted Legendary Togo Stance sounds like it would be straight fire so I'm down with either at this point. It would really depend on how they handle it tbh.
---
I see. And this raptor I assume is the first mount you can unlock?
---
Thanks again for the answers!
---
So.. why would you not want a firebrand in WvW?
---
I do Living World episodes in 4 passes with at least a short gap between.  Between each pass I'm likely doing other content, usually previous episodes/expansions or festivals.
---
Pass 1: Complete the story.  Mess around on the map and play the content while it's fresh and lots of players are there.  Try to complete things that will be much easier while there are a ton of players available.
---
Pass 2: Map complete the new map.  This is usually combined with more exploring the map, doing metas, talking to all the NPCs, and just getting absorbed with the area.  My favorite discovery here is the deep pool in Kourna.  Really beautiful.
---
Pass 3: Complete all achievements (outside of really long term ones).  The story achievements are usually done with other characters as I'm playing through the story with them, but the main map achievements are done with my main.
---
Pass 4: Farm mode. Play the map as I'm interested, get the rewards from hearts, complete the more long term achievements if they weren't done above, gather the map currency for future use, etc.
---
Me too! If I could put some light armor skin on the heavy armor professions I might just go and build myself another character yet!
---
I sold what little I had for 7 silver each. A day later they were 14 silvers each ;-;,
---
Yes, firebrand has no aegis... Hey! Wait a minute...
---
Maybe add a teaser video before the trailer. Just a few clips with some cool things that'll definitely make it into the episode, and let people speculate wildly before the full trailer hits.
---
Alright I can't argue with hoping for the best. I just wish they'd announce a new expansion because frankly speaking new episodes aren't enough to pull me back into playing at the moment. I haven't played actively since I finished playing through PoF. Just like my interest faded with every episode of LS3, the same happened with LS4. I've only played through Daybreak, and it took me months to do so.
---
The amount of times I've logged into the game just wanting to get the log-in reward, and my daily gathering done; only to see a notification for a world boss that I like fighting, and just spending an hour doing a World Boss farm is enough for me to say that that purchase was 100% worth it.
---
Who the fuck advertises outdoors products like this anymore...? Google Ads and Facebook Ads are way cheaper, can be targeted properly and offer conversion analytics. I don't know who is in marketing there but they need to rethink their careers
---
I saw that last line, and thought "is this a fail troll post?"
---
you were missing a loooooong long time i see.
---
They actually nerfed key farming by limiting it once per week per account.
---
But they made an overhaul on BLChest loot and rewards about a year or two ago and people really like them it seems.
---
Everytime I see someone say: "It will NEVER happen", this video comes instantly to mi mind: [Stealth Guardian Never happen omegalulz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDOACN1yfjY).
---
Thread removed: Misuse of the term 'PSA'.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
you havent been farming keys once per week, or buying any with gems it seems
---
Parent to baby: talk
---
Baby: #MAGA  
---
Parent: not like that
---
I want to believe your theory.
---
That is very true, and yet they still feel that they should talk about how it was back then.
---
I don’t touch g-shift because it feels clunky. I use 12 numpad keys + ctrl + alt giving 36 buttons. I haven’t even run out of room in FFXIV so I don’t know how you can use them all for Gw2
---
probably just can't convince you because based on your post, it seems like you've just made some assumptions about both of those classes and never bothered to figure out how they actually work or what they can offer that chronos cant. (eg. at least one or both of them can be hybrid dps, renegades can give additional dps through Assassin's Presence &amp; Soulcleave's Summit, pure support fb can crap out basically every boon including proc, stab, aegis, and resistance but just not alacrity, and fb can still pull if you just use a gs...etc).
---
yes you were! glad i waited. some piece of shit kept playing games when i kept putting up buy orders for 650g like a few weeks back. well, yesterday someone sold it to me for 270. so to that greedy piece of human garbage whose been hoarding them hoping to make a profit, you can go fuck yourself! keep your worthless skins now, clown.
---
Just wondering how you use it? I guess you let off of the mouse to press the numpad keys?
---
I personally think G shift is awful. I just use ctrl or alt for different sets
---
This is my reason for not getting it. I love the skin, it's beautiful, but the skimmer is my least used mount and I have the oceanic one from the original pack with a dye setup that I have. Least used mount and already happy with the skin I have, easy pass. Now if they release a flying turtle skin for the simmer they'll get my money.
---
I feel like for a lot of people nostalgic rit=spirit spam. In that case, yeah kalla has that covered for rit. If anet were to go the ashes as kits route I think it would be a less repetitive and more jack of all trades rev spec, but people wouldn't get the nostalgia boner out of it. 
---
I can see it as a necro spec but I feel like they already have minions, giving them more/different minions wouldn't add much to the class imo.
---
Am I missing something? They revealed the mount and?...
---
The teaser, posters, it’s just nice
---
I use alt + key(lower char line so far) for the mounts and there could literally be 20+ additional mounts and I'd be fine. I wouldn't mind better accessibility for those who want it thought =)
---
That's me. I'd just buy $35 and pile the 700 gems leftover.
---
It's not a new way to get keys, but a few years back they reduced how often the chests themselves drop.  They're still reasonably frequent, but not incredibly common junk drops like they were before.
---
The chests jumping up to around 19 silver is quite recent, though.  A couple of weeks ago they were 'only' 7 silver.  I imagine this spike is due to people wanting that hummingbird and buying up a lot of the supply from the Trading Post.
---
Go with Ranger. If you don't like druid you can run power or condi dps as a soulbeast.
---
If you're willing to go farther, the Heart of Thorns story in Tangled Depths has a key too.
---
Did you really make that account just for that?
---
Druid (ranger), firebrand (guardian), renegade (revenant) are all strong PvE healer support picks, with tempest (elementalist) being a strong full healer. An off healer pick is scourge (necromancer) which doesn't heal, it just protects with barriers.
---
In PvP/WvW, firebrand and scrapper (engineer) are super strong support options
---
And who said elementalist is in a bad spot? It constantly outputs some of the best dps in a PvE setting, and is an amazing backline WvW fighter. Only place it's not a great pick is in PvP just because it takes a lot of work for an average amount of output.
---
What elementalist suffers from is that it plays as a glass cannon. You die to a breeze in the wind if you're not careful
---
Thanks Jennifer Hale!
---
Because most people want the sexual dimorphism so that they can feel like pretty house cats, I suppose.
---
The same thing happened with the light legendary armour, the wedding outfit, and the hexed outfit.
---
Legendary was fixed, but you'll still find different models for wedding and hexed between male and female.
---
Me too, but i have excuse cuz i'm a student &gt;.&lt;
---
Humanoid then :P
---
yes sure, I promise I will "not" steal them or you know they could be placed downtown
---
turtle for underwater mount
---
And please somehow give it a /dance emote
---
I have work and other games to play :v
---
This is good to hear. I really appreciate the assistance. It just seemed like everything I saw was leaning toward certain “meta” builds that I was worried that if you basically weren’t running the meta then there wasn’t a point.
---
If it works for them then sure.  At the end of the day advertising and marketing are driven by statistics &amp; analytics.  I think they've been casting a pretty wide net and trying out a lot of different strategies.  I can respect that, and I hope it goes well for them.
---
Hell,I would settle for them just picking scenery points in possible new areas and showing characters dancing or something. Also I just want to see Rytlock dancing.
---
Agreed. A good elementalist is amazing. Most people aren't good elementalists
---
Mostly likely accounts yeah, there is no way in hell GW2 has anywhere near that many active.
---
Is the Annual Nostalgia achievement in SAB bugged? I completed (Annual) Super Adventure Box Nostalgia and received the Mini Super Adventure Gourdon from it, but the Annual Nostalgia achievement wasn't triggered, so I haven't gotten the 50 AP. I haven't done all 6 zones on tribulation, but only 4 annual achievements should be required, no?
---
No thanks. It would be nice sometimes but I do not want that behavior by default.
---
How did you get a 2 month old and a 7.1 year old reddit account to both post similarly laid out instagram type photos or did the agency that put up the banners handle that?
---
I've noticed getting more killing low level enemies going through core Tyria as opposed to playing 80 content possibly due to being able to kill them with greater frequency.
---
Yea:-)
---
&gt;I’m used to playing healer but Guildwars didn’t really have dedicated healers back when I played. Has that changed? 
---
Yes, but healers are only good in group content.  I suggest having at least a decent DPS gear set before investing in a healing set.
---
Druid is the most desired, not because of its healing (it's actually one of the lowest Heals per Second healers), but its insane utility, buffs, and boon output. Some fractal/raid groups are picky and only want Druids, other groups are pretty open to any healing class.
---
&gt;I’m torn between ranger, ele, or engineer 
---
**Ele**
---
Eles were overpowered for literally years and crowded out the DPS meta, but they've been brought back down to Earth.  So yeah, they're weaker than they used to be, but they're still in a solid spot.  They're very squishy and have tons of skills to learn, so they have a fairly steep learning curve.  But when you're playing solo, you have plenty of liberty to take some defensive skills (which Ele has tons of).
---
Weaver is pretty self centered and very difficult to play, but one of the top DPS in the game. But if you're looking for a fast paced, and engaging rotation, Weaver will provide it.
---
Tempest is a super strong heals per second healer, but provides less utility than other healers.  It also has a DPS build that is less powerful than the Weaver build, but is much easier to execute and isn't required to be *entirely* melee.
---
**Ranger**
---
Ranger is one of the most diverse classes in the game.  It has builds to do pretty much everything.  Plus its builds are on sort of a sliding-scale, you can provide as much or as little support to your group/raid as you want.  
---
Druid is the staple healer in endgame PvE (although ArenaNet has been chipping away at that each balance patch). Despite having weak actual healing output, they have strong buffs and boon output.  You can also play Condition Druid which will give you some DPS, but drastically reduces your healing and reduces your utility.  I like taking my Condi Druid in zergy PvE content since I can provide utility while still pumping out some damage.
---
Soulbeast can be played as a very powerful Power DPS, or a Condi DPS which is a bit out of the meta right now.  Not only does Power Soulbeast hit like a truck, but it can take some support skills to supplement the lack of a Druid.
---
**Engi**
---
All of Engi's build are on the hard side.  All of them require swapping between kits, which requires being comfortable knowing your cooldowns for skills that you can't currently see.  That being said, if you're willing to put the time into learning Engi, it's one of the most unique and the rarest class in the game.
---
Scrapper was literally garbage tier for years, but it got some love to push it to a viable spot (especially in WvW/PvP). In PvE, it pumps out pretty strong heals, and provides light boon utility (not nearly as good as Druid though).
---
Power Scrapper is a solid Power DPS with great CC. Its burst damage is amazing, which makes it really good for solo play. It's not as hard as Weaver or Condi Engineer for endgame content, but maximizing its damage output and learning its rotation will take time.
---
Condi Core Engineer/Condi Scrapper play very similarly, and is probably the single hardest build in the entire game. [Its rotation video really speaks for itself](https://youtu.be/Mt2zNWVpTzo), and that's in a perfect scenario where you never have to interrupt your rotation to dodge or deal with mechanics.  Condi Engi is in a reasonably strong spot, but honestly, is not as strong as other *much* easier condi builds like Mirage and Renegade.
---
forty thirth :^)
---
&gt; I'm gonna steal it
---
And that's why there is seemingly a lack of posters in Germany.
---
Wait, wait. Did this change at some point? I'm pretty sure you couldn't mount up on water surface initially! You definitely *can* now, TIL.
---
Also allows us to have Aurene as a mount in-game, where other players simply see you riding a skyscale so as to not ruin the immersion. They tested this tech with Blish following us in Ep4, now they're implementing it on a larger scale.
---
Mount, teaser, posters, several different ads on different platforms.
---
I use one side button on my mouse for mounts currently. Selection is done with modifiers. 
---
Default is the Jackal, +Ctrl is Raptor, +Alt is Springer, +Shift is Griffon, +Shift+Alt is Skimmer, +Ctrl+Alt is Beetle. Right now, Warclaw has +Shift+Ctrl, but I’ll probably replace it with Skyclaw as I don’t use the Warclaw in PvE anyway.
---
All that does is make it look like a bad mobile game to me.
---
Hello everybody,
---
After going through the mists rift events waaaay too many times I wrote down a lot of data and made a timer out of it.
---
I happen to have stumbled upon on a bug several times where it's possible that you enter an instance from the previous sequence instead (which is quite annoying because your next chance wont be over an hour later)
---
Enjoy!
---
Meta is just that. It's the optimal set up for a given situation to do something as cleanly and quickly as possible. It is by no means the only option
---
There are a few tiers of builds for any given situation. 
---
There's the meta builds, which are amazing assuming you can get everything else set up properly too. You also have to know how to play the meta build for it to be meta
---
And there's the great builds, which aren't meta but they still work for what you need them to do. In fractals, druids aren't considered meta anymore just because people might not need as much healing anymore if you're playing at a high level. But at the same time, we bring a druid because statistically, you're not going to be playing with people who can get by without it
---
You tend to want to be somewhere in those regions when you play with other people.
---
You probably have but it's a repeatable achive so it still dispplays as "incomplete" when you got it this year. You have to click on the achieve and see how many time you got it or how many AP you got from it.
---
there is a way to buy this mount for 2000 gems, im sure you could gift like that.
---
But the black lion chest reward is probably acc bound
---
no they havent. Perhaps you just upgraded the raptors mastery which doubles his jump distance from its default jumping length
---
The poorman's bank access pass.  I also use the PvP lobby on alt accounts, but find the mistlock sanctuary a valuable luxury for my main account.
---
I never bothered to look, tbh. But.... the folks at the wiki did.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fortified_Wall
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reinforced_Wall
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fortified_Gate
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reinforced_Gate
---
It looks like reinforced was 25% for towers and 33% for keeps/castle and Fortified was 33% for towers and 50% for keeps/castle. 
---
So we're looking at maybe 50% more damage for reinforced, and up to twice as much as fortified.
---
They should make a version of this birb mount that looks like a manta ray.
---
I’m still sad that we’re just getting another lw season and not a expac.
---
Me: oh honey, you go ahead and get this hummingbird mount.  It's super cool but I can see how much you dig it, this way you'll have a unique mount ino our static party.
---
Wife: thanks sweety!
---
Me- buys 5 black lion chests. 2nd chest: Hummingbird mount skin!
---
Me: .......
---
While I would like to see better accessibility for Alacrity, this doesn't really carve out a niche for the Herald.
---
Also, effectively removing the capabilities of the Renegade in order to "fix" the Herald is *almost never* the right course of action. Removing the healing capabilities of the Renegade doesn't just affect Raiding/high-tier Fractals, that impacts general PvE play and potentially spills into PvP or WvW depending on the level and extent of the changes. We don't need to break one option in order to fix the other.
---
The biggest issue with Revenant as a whole is the energy system and how it impacts both utility casting and most weapon skills. This extended almost directly into Herald, whereas more time and careful consideration of energy impacts seem to have been made by the time PoF/Renegade came out, namely the number of upkeeps in one Legend.
---
Yeah i think thats it lol i play a lot of WvW.
---
Ogden basically catalysed the event after learning that the lich king had been destroyed, he assumed it was because Aurene ate him.
---
Aurene's vision shows her dying, but she never once looks past this simply due to the fear of dying.
---
I'm nearly certain that eating the power of Joko gave Aurene the ability to resurrect herself. Aurene herself just doesn't realize it yet.
---
North of Vabbi is the Hidden City, which is underground. Not much would look like what is in the trailer.
---
Heralds spot is ok. The healer can upkeep fury and protection to 10 players, extend boonduration and has a nice ferocity-boost to allies. Revenant in general is the ideal offhealer. It has its strengths and weaknesses but both specs has their uses. Small buffs to shield would be nice but thats about it, at least in my opinion.
---
Not everything must be as good as everything else. Some minor buffs would be great tho.
---
Nice joke.
---
You clearly have no idea what balance is.
---
I don't agree with any of your ideas as they are, I think there is need for a much more deep rework of both elite specs. Ideally for me things should be as follows:
---
* Renegade loses most of its group support capabilities in favor of a fully fledged power DPS line that goes in hand with its theme. Finally Revenant as a whole can see a meta power DPS option.
---
* Herald gains everything renegade had that made it a desired support choice, like alacrity sources, something you touched with your OP. It will never be a decent power DPS option because it lacks burst so may as well make the elite spec a completely support oriented one.
---
Humans , tho not from this world, are still based off "humans", so their lifespan is around 70-100 
---
Asura have 5-10% more lifespan than humans, so 80-110 years 
---
Norn can live up to 120yo more or less, tho most die before that cause of their way of living.
---
Charr mature about the same rate as humans do, so they probably live just as long.
---
As for sylvari, we really dont know, its quite early to say, none of the oldest (first, second born sylvari) died of old age yet after 25-30 years.   
---
Tho they are able to "grow" and "shape" parts of their body (such as "home grown clothes") i dont think they are able to regrow things such as entire limbs? If they are, then they could potentially live indefinitely.
---
On the other hand, we have Ogres live extremely long lives, some are even more than 250 years old and its not that uncommon. A similar story goes with the Jotun.
---
Furthermore, I'd really hope for it to become a passive benefit for all "flying mounts" to be able to use updrafts (so we're not leaving out the griffon), kinda like how the jackal lets all the movement skills have evade frames, etc.
---
It's a shame things like updrafts and mushrooms have been put to the wayside. I'd love to see them get just a bit more use out of them than we're currently getting. I miss some of the more elaborate jungle gym elements on maps from HoT.
---
Yeah, when I saw it returning I got super excited as well.
---
As another poster mentioned, it would make sense for them to release it with the new dragon mount. I hope that's what Anet does/was planning on doing.
---
"and if you don't save us, don't worry! One of us shall sacrifice for the greater good and activate emergency defenses. You won't get ant treasure though.......it resets every half hour!"
---
This has been bugging me for a while now but if alacrity reduces recharge by 25% (ignoring that one chrono trait), why does the wiki say it recharges in 80% of the time? I know 4, 5, and 20 have an awkward relationship in fractions so I'm wondering if this is just me misunderstanding or a typo.
---
__*The greater good*__
---
You realize that this post is about HERALD and not renegade? Feel free to give your opinion on my ideas not my person. Incredibly rude comment.
---
Jumping isn't necessary.  Couple of possible issues:
---
* It's likely you were slightly out of sync with server, so you may have been outside the white circle
---
* If some other players are in the "catch" zone, I think the most recent player to enter will get it
---
* Not sure if you need to face in the direction of the incoming crystal
---
You press F to catch them, jumping keeps you from getting knocked back when you do catch them.
---
Do every achievement and collect all the items from the vendors.
---
Because half the game plays neon purple/pink themed chrono/mirages now
---
Even if they extended the range of those to 5000 units you would still be fucking things up due to the mechanics of certain fights
---
I did some math on this a few days ago.
---
I do not remember specific numbers but the general result was that copper is best for blues and whites and runecrafter is in fact better than silverfed and copperfed for greens and yellows.... BUT only if the drop rate of charms and symbols is higher than some  number( 0.07%  I think?).
---
I can share it later when I am home if you're interested
---
lol wut?
---
We got two whole weapon sets made of pink branded crystal last LW chapter
---
Also keep in mind that it would take you hundreds of thousands of salvaged items to repay the cost of the salvage o matic in the first place.
---
you can farm 1 free key per week, some people collect it and use all up when theres a good item/s in the chest.
---
You can right click on the chest to preview its content (which keep changing every now and then).
---
The latest hummingbird mount is apparently so popular it skyrocketed black lion chest prices to almost 20s per piece.
---
So unless you dont have keys or dont wanna spend gold/gems on them, sell them away for some extra silver
---
makes sense :)
---
I guess the rules are the same though : it counts as the previous one, only go in if you need it and there is enough time to not miss the next one
---
Herald and rev are basically ubiquitous in this game. There's no reason to run the base class, and there hasn't been since launch.
---
That's my birb!
---
Even though their intended target is marked on the ground like an AoE, the crystals are projectiles, not AoEs, if you are too far, it'll hit the ground instead you.  
---
Try to stand on the edge of the inner circle closer to the champion so the projectile will properly hit your collision box.
---
* Being out of sync is usually fixed with an emote like /dance.
---
* It's the closet player. The crystals are projectiles, whoever is closer will be hit first and grab it. The circles on the ground are just a reference, they do not really determine if you'll grab it. Being hit by the projectile determines it. Just to test it, I've actually climbed a few of the large terrain crystals there, and intercepted the projectiles mid-flight nowhere near the aoes. In open world I even managed to catch a couple mid-flight while gliding. You can also see some of the terrain like the large crystals in the rift intercepting the projectiles sometimes
---
* Nope. I got several of them while literally looking away, both character and camera.
---
Thats because humans have 2 eyes
---
Pressing F is unnecessary. There isn't even a prompt to press F.
---
Same ^^
---
Yup, that's what I'm doing.  Just hitting the jump button.
---
No F needed.
---
It's much harder when you want to return but you dont have expansions
---
the episodes are a snoozefest for everyone else, great content for bad players
---
Ah, good to know.  Thanks for your input.
---
That's a very dangerous loop to fall into. I really do not recommend that you use gambling as a way to treat stress or any other mental condition.
---
Hell I dont use addons or whatever gw2 radial is, and I dont have problems with having more mounts, my plain keyboard still has more hotkeys to fill.
---
OS is nicer since the bank is much closer to the spawn. Everything is closer together in general. Only drawback is if you actually play WvW since that will slowly eat away at your participation level.
---
Nice that you think that, but it's not like showing approval of this is going to have any effect on how the marketing team operates. They're going to act based on how it affects sales.
---
Increase the recharge rate by 25% means that if the usual CD is X then under perfect Alacrity uptime the new CD is X/1.25 and 1/1.25 = 0.8 so X*0.8 which is why when the wiki say the skill recharges in 80% of the time it is also correct.
---
Not to mention the "chest", since the main character was looking for bewbs since the start
---
It's not really rude at all.  A little intense sure, but not rude.  If you can't handle that kind of comment why are you on the internet?
---
Elementalist can be a very difficult class in raids, the main power builds all rotate between Air and Fire, where Tempest is relatively easy, followed by Core Ele, then Bolt Weaver, and lastly Fresh Air Weaver which is renowned as being almost piano-like in its methodical, complex rotation. It feels damn good, though, and honestly, none of these are terribly difficult to learn with enough practice. As others have said, DPS Ele is **the** glass cannon build, and is extremely high-risk high-reward.
---
Condition Weaver dwarfs its power counterparts in difficulty and fragility by a huge margin. This build is crafted around Weave Self, a skill which grants boons for each attunement, but then needs to be popped within twenty seconds to double the duration. So not only do you have to get comfy with your four-second attunement cooldowns (and associated skills), you need to know when to pop Weave Self at the last second, and memorize ANOTHER rotation for the second part.
---
Do note that in any raid scenario, someone else will be healing you 24/7; when people talk about Ele being "fragile" they mean for each second you're not pumping skills onto the boss, any other class is better. Ele has some of the highest APM per DPS, so where other classes can press one button and have 10% of their DPS guaranteed, Eles will have to push three buttons within the same time to be effective. Of course there's a more traditional fragility too; I wouldn't take Ele into Matthias Gabriel or overworld unless I liked being in downstate 24/7.
---
Alternatively, since you mentioned healing, there is a build of Tempest that can run heals or boons. It's a very beginner-friendly build, and shows off the versatility of the class. It's not nearly as good as Druid, but it's still absolutely viable.
---
Engineer follows almost exactly the same pattern as Elementalist. Power Holo is the most basic rotation, and I would highly recommend it just for its versatility. The build has far more survivability than Ele, and can actually be used in the overworld comfortably. The difficulty is about the same as power Tempest, making it a more forgiving rotation than most Ele rotations.
---
Every other Engi rotation is condition-based, and therefore, a nightmare. Condition Weaver is hard, like, **hard**, but condi Engi is basically the same thing with MORE invisible cooldowns and MORE memorization. Every non-weapon skill changes your weapon skills, so you have in effect five different weapons you're swapping between, and all of their cooldowns are hidden. At least with condi Weaver you get to see your longest cooldowns for a few seconds more.
---
Engi does also have, more recently, a viable heal build as well. Healer Scrapper is not that bad, with the changes to Gyros and whatnot. The build is straightforward and relatively easy, with the biggest drawback being the lack of offensive buffs.
---
Would a button to "Always track dailies" help?
---
completely agree, but i tend to get keys when there is stuff i like avaiable with statuettes, last time i got tons of keys [both buying and farming] and ended up with the mount skin and 3 infinite gathering tools..
---
guess i'll do the same now since i want a couple of outfits and i can still complete tons of maps with alts in my free time this weekend
---
Wait, really? All this time I thought the damage was set when you apply the condition, not checking back to whatever your stats are each tick. So I could apply, say, a stack of bleeding, then gain might and the stack of bleeding would do more damage?
---
Don't worry about it. You'll be matched with people similar to your skill level after a few games. Just try your best and communicate with your team, and you'll be better than 90% of the sPvP regulars in terms of being a good team mate.   
---
Here's what I recommend if you're only playing sPvP for the rewards. Pick 3 of the top tier builds from 3 different classes, take those builds into the PvP lobby golems and arena, practice each for like 5 minutes, and just play 1 game of each of those 3 classes per day. This will get you on the right track towards Year of Ascension achievements. Don't stress yourself if you are losing, don't lose your cool if your team is flaming or the enemy is shit talking, and just try to enjoy it as much as you can. If someone is being toxic, immediately mute and report. It's much easier on your long term enjoyment of a game mode you aren't that invested in.
---
can confirm that having a skin you like a lot, can motivate to use mounts.
---
i literally forgot about raptor till i got the cool armored skin
---
This has been me for the past 2 weeks...
---
Well as a matter of fact it happens to be that I have autism which makes it difficult for me to interact with people in real life. Therefore I end up spending a lot of time on the internet. I am also more sensitive to negativity compared to most people. April happens to be autism awareness month so feel free to read about my condition, would make me happy:  [http://www.autism-society.org/get-involved/national-autism-awareness-month/](http://www.autism-society.org/get-involved/national-autism-awareness-month/)  
---
I hope this answered your question. I also do think its kinda sad how people can be as mean as they want and hide behind "this is the internet bitch" and its all of a sudden fine. Treat people the same way online as irl that's what I want!
---
i think they actually spiked to 11s even before this skin, i tend to put the chests i drop into my bank, i accidentally saw the price and made some extra money selling them, it was nice
---
There should be unique treasure to big meta events like this. 
---
 Themed skins and other items of the like would really breathe life into these events.  Give it a low drop rate but at least let there be a chance of something that says Tarir from doing Tarir's meta.
---
The chests have enough other rewards that I think it’s worth a try. There is a gambling high, but I should be mature enough to keep myself in check. Everything in moderation. I’ll support RNG when it makes sense, and it’s not that different from buying lottery tickets or visiting a casino.
---
As a new player, I would definitely get the copper fed first. It's not about making coin as it is about efficiency. Copper fed kits will free up inventory space, and allow you to be more efficient and faster with your runs because you spend less time managing inventory. 
---
if you're going to spend 200+ gold upfront, it should definitely be about the QoL and not about squeezing every last drop out of greens.
---
I'm gonna say Norn for the voice lines
---
I just wasted 4 hours in trib mode and it kicked me out for not having continue coins.
---
there is no daily limit. you can run it 100 times for the token if you want
---
They are not daily. You can farm the skins in 1 day if you choose to.
---
Chests are once per day per account, but you can farm as many of the green and yellow skin tokens as you want per day. The bouncy chest and the baubles when you beat the bosses are there every run and the tokens is contained in the bouncy chest.
---
You can farm the Trophys for the skins all in one day. The bonus reward chest is always spawning after you looted the chest the first time for a day(that with 4 Bauble Bubbles) and has those Trophys too.
---
Eldrazi\* xD
---
Daily rewards, chests and digging spots were account bound last time I checked.
---
Pick-up baubles are repeatable.
---
That makes sense! One of the few I still haven't gotten round to doing, thank you!
---
Correct! Thank you!
---
Carapace, it turns out.
---
This is a well recorded phenomenon.
---
They would put an animal like rats or pigeon and give them treats at random times. Sooner or later they would develop a 'tick' like standing in one spot or moving in a certain way because the treat happened to coincide with when they did that.
---
Oh, this is wonderful thank you so much! Really happy to hear I can just build one set and be all around okay. Not playing on tanking just enjoy the support role. And thanks for clearing up snowcrows, that really confused me! So if I am understanding right, it doesn't matter as much what gear the stats are on, as long as the boon duration is a good number? And that is a great build order so thank you very much. Will probably ignore assasin's as well, for the time being so as to not get overwhlelmed or confused again. This feels like I can relax a bit now with an achievable goal.  Seriously can't thank you enough :D
---
Not usually for Easter specifically. They just wrapped up their March sales and there will probably be more in the future. August is a big one too since it’s the anniversary sales.
---
I recommend Pistol/Pistol thief. Good damage, good survivability -- remember, though, that you'll need to kite and you probably don't want to get caught in a large group of mobs. It's very single-target focused. But bursting down mobs can be pretty fun!
---
Pistol/Pistol engie is one of my absolutely favorite builds to play, and it's how I leveled my main. That said, though, it's a lot harder than thief -- it has a lot of options if you're good at juggling kits and such, but you won't kill as fast and requires a lot more skill and coordination, which doesn't really come until you have a lot of engineer experience under your belt. It's also generally played as a condi build, which isn't easy to do as a leveling build. If you want to play p/p engie at 80, it might be good to level with just so you spend that time getting used to the playstyle and skill usage, but if you're just looking for something fun to level with, I wouldn't recommend it.
---
Mesmers cannot use dual pistols.
---
Slightly off-topic but I felt like I never "got" what a renegade was made for? What is the thematic root of it?
---
I think this was pretty much obvious..but thanks for writing it down anyway lol.
---
Minstrel armor set cost me about 191g to craft, the earrings rings and amulet about the same and the weapons about 75g. Your fastest way is to craft the gear if you have the gold to support the cost of the pearls.
---
At this rate, I literally just expect it to be a giant dead floppy fish. Now anything better will be a fantastic surprise.
---
I'd like the precursor to be a greatsword made by combining Madgaer and Sohothin into a single sword.
---
So first you'd have two pre-precursors, then make the pre-cursor out of them.
---
Whatever it is, it'll be better than all other gen 2 legendaries...because as gw2 tradition goes...GS ALWAYS gets the most attention and love when it comes to skins.
---
I want a dragon greatsword...so that I can finally have my charr guardian riding skyscale (I really hope it is decent in size) with all his glory.
---
Depends on the hour but I don't have problems joining in 10 minutes before. 5 min might be pushing the limits cause I've failed a few, but 10 minutes was always fine.
---
Oh that's nice to know, thanks :)
---
Are you a person laying fully dead under Tequatl's foot, by chance? Or on a blighting tower racetrack? &gt;\_&gt;
---
Oh but you should have bought 2 lottery tickets...
---
now i want a giant dead floppy fish legendary greatsword.
---
From what I've found, run I run scrapper support, the build is fun but the loot sucks.
---
How come 90% of pugs can't seem to do the ooze boss on Thaumanova within a reasonable amount of attempts? People just stop using their brains despite deciding you're going to kill the vets.
---
&gt;herald has burst
---
I don't think it does in any format, you won't one shot anyone with a herald the way you do with pMesmer or DE.
---
if i were an asura the first thing id do is give myself a cool tail
---
that sounds similar to m+ in wow. m+ can be a good way to get high end gear but typically if youre geared from the mythic raid, your gear is on average better than what you get from m+ barring a very lucky upgrade. i grinded m+ in wow to about 2200 rating in season 1(highest achieved was 2800) purely for the fun of it and ranking.
---
First of all, [the happy raider's kit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/829k93/the_gw2_happy_raiders_kit_a_guide_to_starting/) is worth a read. Secondly, training discords like the ones listed on [snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/) are a fantastic resource to get experience.
---
I could go on a big spiel here, but I'll boil down my recommendations for new players' build choices to some bullet point here:
---
- Daredevil/Deadeye (power DPS; very easy)
---
- kitless sword holo (power DPS; easy)
---
- Dragonhunter (power DPS; easy)
---
- Druid (support; easy)
---
Any one of these would be good places to start, as you'll have an easy class to play that will be in demand on pretty much every encounter. Once you have one of these classes and are looking to flesh out your roster some more, you might want to look into banner warrior, Chrono, and condition DPS.
---
My prediction is that there will be 2 gen 2 greatswords that can be combined to form 1 mega expensive greatsword. That greatsword can be combined with eternity to make an even more expensive greatsword.
---
&gt; people just stop using their brains
---
You just answered your own question friendo.
---
Two precursors and two different legendary greatsword, but you only can craft one per account
---
I like your dyes on the Hummingbird, they make the mount really fleshed out from the backgrounds. But your chars are a bit monochromatic and use cultural/Nightmare a bit too much for my taste.
---
I want it to be a RTX: On greatsword
---
i'd kinda like to see a Madgaer and Sohothin style greatsword.  but with crystal energy instead of blue or red fire.
---
Oh now that you mention it you're completely right! Hammer herald doesn't provide any burst in WvW!
---
And power mesmer has better burst compression than herald, so we'll pretend herald doesn't burst anything while disregarding the fact power mesmer has barely seen play since PoF.
---
Back to being a fractal goddess I suppose.
---
buy the lottery ticket next time when they introduce a special mount skin :)
---
The precursor cost would be obviously split between the two sword. 
---
You would craft 2 swords, then 1 precursor greatsword with them, then the legendary.
---
I cannot compare GW2 to WoW, since I’ve never played the latter, but I can tell you that the combat in GW2 is the best. It’s enganging and requires you to react to what is going on. You are not just mindlessly pressing buttons. 
---
That’s what makes GW2 fun in all game modes. You truly have control of whether you character dies or not. So jumping into something like PvP could easily give you an idea of how the combat is, even if you do so with a free account. 
---
If you find something like PvP fun and challenging, I have no doubt that you would enjoy raids and fractals. Many, many people play endgame with little regard for rewards or progression simply because they enjoy the game.
---
What is the fastest free way to farm Spirit Shards? The following two paragraphs outline the fastest techniques that I'm aware.
---
I can create a character, power craft them to level 80, delete the character, and repeat. This will net twenty-five spirit shards each time. This is the fastest way to farm spirit shards that I know of (without having stacks of tomes), but obviously power crafting requires a large amount of resources and thus can be quite expensive. I'm between jobs right now, so I'd rather not buy gems to indirectly dump into those resources.
---
The fastest free way that I know of is to grind Dragon's Stand. With all Heart of Thorns masteries… mastered, the plethora of events allow one to quickly farm Spirit Shards. Additionally, the events themselves often award Spirit Shards. However, the problem with this method is that it leaves about forty to sixty minutes of downtime between runs. Unfortunately, I've forgotten the rate at which one can acquire Spirit Shards via this method, but I'm wondering if somebody who is more experienced can chime in with a faster method.
---
I'm aware of the Treasure Mushroom events and the Daily Completionist achievement, but I'm looking for something that I can grind out for an entire day. I want to spend more than I'm currently earning.
---
There was no reason for you to be rude, man. Just state your case and let the facts speak for themselves.
---
Daammnn yoouuu Paavlooovv
---
OP is just responding to the speculation that it might be integral to the story, in which case it would likely not be dependent on a collection like the other ones. A number of people were suggesting this, though as everyone in this thread has pointed out, the established method of past episodes is much more likely.
---
Yeah, those are my... plantier sylvari. I have two others with more of a mix - my canon commander in scales and metal armor, and a daredevil who's basically full cyborg.
---
What if I told you there are 2 Legendary Greatswords that can be combined....
---
The plot thickens
---
Please share your experiences of W2z2 once you do it
---
My default mount is the griffon. It's obviously not as fast on the ground, but I usually don't mind that so much. I much prefer not needing to dismount a jackal or raptor just to jump over or onto something, especially if I've aggroed a nearby enemy. Few things irritate me more than when an enemy hits me mid-mount-switch.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEMPLrWh35g  
---
Whlie most spiders are just mean/ugly looking by nature, some are actually fairly cute without needing an artist's hand.
---
It ultimately depends on the level of detail and types of artistic liberties taken with the in game design because IRL insects are generally rather grotesque looking when you examine them closely enough.  
---
The artists do it right when they make it as impressive and/or gorgeous when we zoom right into the things face as the irl one is from a few feet away lol
---
Would never of done Trib without Taco and Tekkit's guide, and even then I have no idea how I finished it with still having a working keyboard.
---
I will never do trib ever again. I would rather be ____ by ____ than do trib again. Seriously, fill in the blanks. Anything is better than that evil evil mode.
---
Once a week, you create a character and run it through the level 10 storyline for the key you get at a the end. There are also keys at level 40, 60, Living World Season 2 episode 8, and Heart of Thorns Act 3. The level 10 one is gated weekly, but the rest can be run as much as you want. I spent a week getting all my permanent characters through level 40 storyline and randomly push them a bit further. lol
---
I actually got the Gecko that way! I was so excited! :D
---
Best way to handle Sub 6 with pugs is to drop a Chrono or Druid for an extra DPS or Support/DPS like a pQuickbrand or cQuickbrand. 
---
People obsess way too much over having "perfect" boons from things like FB/Ren or Chrono/Druid.  The reality is that Subject 6 is an ooze, and oozes are low toughness, low armor monsters that are super susceptible to competent burst from various power classes.  
---
In addition [consumable CC \(Shovels, Rods, Planks\)](https://discretize.eu/guides/consumables) are *super* useful for breaking bars.  If you're within about 15-25% you can usually still burst it to zero so long as you get a fast break on the 2nd break-bar immediately when it recovers.  That 15-25% threshold is usually where 3x DPS compositions run into issues because there's almost always one player that's under-performing.  Players that panic and get scared of going down (as if you can't still DPS while downed) are another problem.
---
[I expect something like that.](https://i.imgur.com/S1oTk.png)
---
Such a good daily too. It should be a daily every day and then maybe people will take the time to save somebody before they need to WP.
---
I'll wait till it goes on sale. These things often go on sale before they get pulled. I really want it—but definitely not for 2,000 gems. That's $25.00 for a *skin* that I wouldn't be using too frequently. I'd rather use those gems for gold for other purposes.
---
I did not know that. Thats kinda cool.
---
&gt; ...drop a Chrono or Druid for an extra DPS...
---
While you are right. I think if the players on the struggle bus with subject 6 there is zero chance they will also be players that are willing to swap classes for a fight. Getting people to swap skills or weapons or traits is already hard enough. Thats before the already huge hurdle of having pugs that talk to each other or read chat.
---
Im being cynical but this is also my experience pugging T4s nearly every day for a year.
---
Maybe both?
---
Dolphin has great straight line movement with a speed boost special, but maybe can't dive deep, or make sharp turns. Or maybe it has a "come up for air" bar that builds up while mounted and declines slowly as you don't use it (or maybe put its speed boost on an initiative based system instead of a dodge one).
---
Turtle is slower in a straight line but very maneuverable, and is immune to environmental effects like a skimmer, and has stronger armor and resistance than any other mount, allowing you to take significant damage without being dismounted. Special action is a PBAoE knock back that also gives you and 5 nearby allies a barrier.
---
The new legendary greatsword will combine with Eternity to make...
---
A SWORDfish!
---
You still have ap up for grabs. Better get back in there champ.
---
I just invested in an infinite continue coin to be honest. I think it's soo worth having if you're trying to run these skins.
---
Your complete and total disregard for everything that is fashion wars 2 is why the gods left Tyria.
---
I saw these in LA yesterday too and they prompted me to come home and fire up my client for the first time in forever!
---
IF you have all the masteries completed for a region then each level completion would give a spirit shard.
---
So let's say you have all mastery completed in PoF or HoT, any experience you gain in the region would give spirit shard..I don't do it on purpose of farming shard but i have got a lot of them accumulated by doing events.
---
The others that I know of, you mention.
---
If so, gamble first before spending the 2k gems, who knows you might get lucky
---
Good concepts. Dolphins can make crazy sharp turns in real life though but I like the idea of it having a diving limit and coming up for air both of which really fit. Give it crazy good speed at like 10-20 feet of water and as you get deeper it goes slower and slower as it loses energy to get you to go back up and take a breath.
---
Turtle as tank works great and would be very useful in many water maps that have a ton of hazards and enemies that love to rush you.
---
I know most people don't want it but I would really love to have an underwater expansion.
---
You can play the entire core game for free.
---
Would you mind showing them? The cyborg sounds particularly interesting.
---
And don't get me wrong, I like slyvari too and I have some looks of my own. I am not trying to diss your looks, its just that I like multiple colors a lot.

Maybe next season we spend more time in the mists and discover the remnants of the Aetherblades that fled into the Mists, finding out these leftover humans are now powerful Mistnauts that destroy whatever they find that they cannot enslave.

Try W2Z2 tribulation, it's easier.
---
you make that jump look so easy.  I've spent the last hour trying it and I can't even get close  T.T. Trib really isn't for me xD.
---
&gt; You seem to not have answered the arguments that actually supported my point, or quoted only specific segments and ignored the rest.
---
Because I'm not going to quote a wall of text and reply with one. I made my point, I have zero interest in arguing something that is pointless to argue that we'll find out in a few weeks.
---
Yeah, that is a possible location. I never claimed otherwise. But I think there are more likely locations.
---
You claimed that 1) I was saying the mixture was problematic (I didn't), and 2) "Sunward Marches and Marga Coast are the only big main maps from mainland Elona that haven't been covered yet." (that's false).
---
That's the point of my reply, so that's why I didn't "answered the arguments that actually support [your] point" because I'm not trying to counter your point. I'm counting your argument that your point is the only viable option or that I had issue with something.
---
&gt; You suggest that the vegetation and the presence of skyscale bound the map to not be in central Elona despite the fact we have evidences and precedents showing that mounts can be justified, invented or retcon in GW’s universe at will (griffon, skimmer, springer, warclaw) or that the geography/vegetation can be flexible (Istan, Kourna).
---
All of those examples are either creatures from GW1 (griffon), brand new to the universe literally (warclaw), from an area unexplored before (springer), or migrated to the land after a major event (skimmer, raptor). So I fail to see how that counters my statement that if humans had known about some region that housed living, normal, dragons, it wouldn't go unknown.
---
And sure, they could alter geography a bit, but if we work on that, then we get literally fucking nowhere because, hey, maybe the sun now has grass on it.
---
&gt; In the end, I’m not closed to the idea that the map could be elsewhere (and I apologize if I sounded condescending, it wasn't the tone I aimed for)
---
You have been, and honestly, still are.
---
&gt; but I feel you’re being too prompt to dismiss Marga and Sunward Marches as possibilities for arbitrary reasons.
---
I never dismissed it as a possibility. I dismissed it as "the only place in Elona we've not gone" or as the place I personally think we're going.
---
That only agrees with me, you know. Linsey was talking not about the location or the map's name or the map east of DR, but that specific iteration of the map that surrounded DR.
---
I'd say LW/Patches are part of the expansion in the same way. That's a lot of content added, plus raids? I missed out on a few months of gameplay so I'm still not sure what's new.
---
With [Nova Launch](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Nova_Launch_(Mistlock_Sanctuary)) in Mistlock Sanctuary, everything is close to the spawn.    And with a 1/2 second cooldown, you can spam it to your hearts content, going 1800" in any direction faster than (insert funny simile here). 
---
I have to be honest though, I do not have any experience with OS (assuming you are referring to Armistice Bastion).
---
alright thanks for the insight
---
i already know that but i was talking about how enjoyable the core game without the raids and dungeons
---
RIP Frames
---
Wow 2 of the biggest contrarians on this reddit arguing. What is this? a Crossover episode?
---
I'd do that in a heartbeat.
---
So you are missing out of all the new colors of the weapon skins and the infusions :P
---
There was only a single hint in the patchnotes and two new achievements in the current events ui so it's pretty easy to miss!
---
That is the exact opposite of the point. They do this to attract new players, not the likes of you. If you don’t enjoy the game, this is not the place to voice that.
---
Nice try Mardoo
---
Ah San Andreas I miss you, here we go agai-
---
ALL YOU HAD TO DO-...
---
Yeah, my laptop is getting old.
---
Any class except maybe necro. If you want some easier class I'd suggest ranger or guardian.
---
More humans. No thanks. New lore please.
---
You use 1 key to open 1 box, after opening the key disappears.
---
Thanks now I unironically want this
---
Tybalt, introduction.
---
Yes, commander

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:  
---
* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.
---
So basically the Gallant greatsword?
---
pfff, T4 recs is where all the cancer is,that LITERALY place,where i get my everyday dose of insults from random necros/lb rangers,lb guards all without pots or food,BUT IM FUCKING TRASH BRO :DDD
---
bcs when you tell ppl after first fail,to just drop ooze to  85% and wait for shield,you can be sure that no1 (or at least one dps which cant read or i dont know what is that one person issue) will give a fuck. But since im doing T4 with CM groups,this is issue of the past,it was literaly reason to start doing CMs at the first place,ppl actualy listen there,have no issue with swaping skills or classes.DPS there is actualy dps,not warrior aa with dagger,so you dont have to DROP chrono as someone sugested here (probably most demented thing ive ever heard) and just burst it in 10 sec.
---
I practically dont speak when I pug Fractals, I simply make my own groups asking for people to pot up and use some sort of consumables, groups fills fast enough, and with said requirements, people usually know what to do
---
You're just a liability, Trahearne.
---
I have SO MANY Outfits I wish I could at least match with other hats. But ideal would be to be able to split them. Damn, let us at least split shoulders/gloves/bootdls/hats and keep body and legging together if that's the biggest issue. So many boots from outfits I wanna use!
---
I got both infusions, no taco. Did it for fun , anet didnt force me ...
---
I should probably not say that but i usually farm all my keys but this time i bought 5 keys because yeah that mount. I got it on the third. Saved me a lot of key and gold farming :)
---
Its a game, its not a job , why u do fractals if you feel bad about doing it ?
---
also no weird prehensile tail
---
I dont see a wide blade or runic symbols so no, nothing like a gallant greatsword.
---
Or at the very least the hot ones.
---
I'm done with the Toad, and I'm 7 runs away from the wizard.
---
I'll never go back there. EVER.
---
Lion's Arch... Home. At least is was until Scarlett fucked everything up.
---
I don't pug much but that is actually mostly the same for me. For t4 anyway. T1 doesn't matter. T2 mostly doesn't matter so that only leaves t3.
---
They should reveal the release date on the day before the release date
---
Thank you! Also, what class do you suggest? Before I left, I had a elementalist, and I remember it was a fresh air dagger x dagger build, was pretty fun and I really liked it. What class should I take now? Or which ones do you recommend me? I've mainly played pve, and I did some fractals before I left, not many though.
---
Think of the title for 100 kills!
---
I think it depends on your region (EU/NA), when you pug (AM/PM), whether or not you do CMs, and how selective you are in LFGing.
---
As someone who generally doesn't do CMs aside from on the odd occasion, and pugs before EU prime time (AM-early afternoon), I usually have to cycle through 1-2 groups before I get a decent one. Every day.
---
I've been tempted to do a video gag reel of the shit I see in my daily runs, but I feel like half the people who'd watch it wouldn't see a problem, and the other half would be mildly infuriated.
---
Well done ANET!
---
It is a matter of time. If you put around reset three groups are normally good, of you try to put from 5 to 6 hours after reset you will have a bad time
---
Find a guild. With the right people, you will enjoy fractals WAY more.
---
Thank you!!!
---
Imma go ahead and agree with you, skimpy armour and reapers hood, I hate it lol
---
That's a lot of keys ...  :O
---
yup totally did, thanks for the heads up
---
&gt; ...but a few years back they reduced how often the chests themselves drop.
---
you are the second person I have seen say this. Do you remember when that change was made and possibly a source? The wiki say anything about bl chests dropping at a lower rate as far as i can tell so far.
---
Love when you join a pug w/ somewhat of a requirement in terms of meta/p+f and people are to cheap to buy pots or try to sneak it off with a minor one thinking people won't notice. Most of the time it's those people that actually need the potions the most as well in regards to how well they do mechanics/survive. :)
---
Pro tip, for spiky ice room bring potions. Take damage from the second trib cloud, use your potion to stun break, and then use mercy invincibility to cross the spikes to the exit.
---
Gw2 forum: no posting! Just reading!
---
I have razer naga with 12 buttons, and I play a Mesmer. 1-3 are push to talk, 1, and map. 4-8 are Chrono keys and 9 is special action. There's literally not enough keys on this ridiculous mount to accommodate all the mounts... I just use the keys above arrow keys, and make it work for now. In-game radial would make sense and incredibly useful.
---
Tysm
---
Hmm ... maybe a legendary throne
---
Business also run on money, and you know what makes money? Happy costumers. Im not saying double up on "problems", all Im saying is open up ways for people to be even happier with your system, net result is, and I can guarantee you this, more people will be happy about being able to mix and match, than people unhappy some armor parts slightly clips with another armor parts. Sure, there will always be people who cant stand the minimal of clipping, but most other people will simply work around it until a better fix is issued, like they have been doing up until now.
---
You know I'd actually be willing to throw them some money if things in this game were priced appropriately. Basic ass unbreakable tools cost more than this dank mount.
---
It’s good to explain it because there are a lot of people that know how to play the game but just don’t know how some metas work. There are people who do a lot of PvP or raids or WvW and one day they decide to make a legendary and need to farm or do achievements. These people can be told what to do and can follow basic instructions like what to cc.
---
I have a static group and we have to pug that last slot, and man, pugs can not read. The last 2 times we've done 100CM we ask for EXP and *every damn time* we get a pug who has no EXP and we end up asking them to leave. Why put a description when people don't read it.
---
Didn't know it worked that way, thanks.
---
It's a tiered achievement. You did one zone which opened the next tier. Just click the achievement to see which one you did, or do all three at once. It's world 1 infantile, shouldn't take more than 20 minutes.
---
Zone 2 and 3 of world 1 in infantile mode. Like it said.
---
Oddly enough I get smoother and more reliable runs pugging than I do with guildies.
---
I went to do this meta and nobody tagged at south. I volunteered to tag up and had to ask what the hell I was doing. Someone was very helpful and explained stuff to me. Ended up with at least 20 people following. Why the hell are people so scared to tag up?
---
After going through all 6 zones in trib mode, I can honestly say the absolute worst part of it all is the [ice spike room in 2-3](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EUWvE2eTRh4/maxresdefault.jpg).  Checkpoint at one end of the room, cloud checkpoint at the other side.  How hard could it be?
---
My only 2-3 trib run, I was stuck on that room for over an hour.  over 200 deaths, I lost count.  It was an absolute *nightmare*.
---
2-2 wasn't as hard by comparison, even the piranha pagoda didn't take me as long as that one fucking room.
---
I use Steams In-Home streaming all the time.  
---
And I do stream GW2 to my bedroom and it works great, even using a Gamepad.
---
Regarding your problem; maybe change the Steam hardware options for streaming?  
---
And you might have luck switching to windowed fullscreen in GW2, instead of exclusive fullscreen.
---
Just for fun; here's a video of Steams In-Home streaming to an Android phone and using a gamepad.  
---
[https://youtu.be/M\_3rCqjIBkA](https://youtu.be/M_3rCqjIBkA)
---
It doesn't actually say that here.
---
Oh yes! commandos of our era falling into the mist.
---
I went back prowling through game updates and couldn't find where they mentioned it.  I guess there's a chance that it was a change that wasn't officially documented in the update notes, but were mentioned by a dev somewhere else?
---
I remember back in 2012-13, and now, and the difference in how many Black Lion Chests you get as drops.  Just can't find the written proof right now, sorry!
---
You are free to not like someones post or character but you don't have to be a prick about it. Take this as a verbal warning. If all you have to say is something insulting, don't bother saying it in the future.
---
Which sigil is it gonna be this time?
---
Humans are primary focus of this game. I would rather see some enemy from other races such as ~~big humans~~ norns (no Sons of Svanir) or Charrs (no Flame Legion).
---
I know it's a lot of work on their end, but I'd buy a lot more outfits if they gave me the individual pieces to mix and match.
---
I don't think that would bring in new players, honestly. It's more likely to sticker-shock them out of trying the game in the first place.
---
IMO it's a lot more effective to get them interested and bring them in with free-to-play or a small purchase, then allow them to buy the rest (once they're hooked). Remember how people regard prices when they see them: there's a reason that many things (in the US at least) are priced as $19.99 instead of just $20.00. People are inherently attracted to what appears to be the lower number, even when the difference is negligible. People are also a lot more likely to feel good about many purchases for small amounts rather than one large purchase with a huge price-tag on it, *even if the bundle saves them money*. (To be fair, it can swing the other way if the bundle includes only 2-3 items and the cost difference is easier to calculate, but the more items you add into the bundle and thus the higher the price, the more likely people are to absolutely balk at the idea -- *especially* brand new players.)
---
I think the idea of having smaller bundles that include an expansion plus related story seasons is a really good one, and more manageable... but the target audience you *specifically* mention, and the target audience for ad campaigns like this -- brand new players who have never touched the game before --  aren't going to be pulled in by a giant bundle that would almost certainly have a big price tag on it.
---
I'll consider doing that when you consider upholding your own subreddit's rules that you've set forth yourself.
---
Hell, just giving me the option to wear bunny or cat ears with the outfits would make me spend money on them.
---
Weirdly (maybe not weird), what I am looking forward to after the last legendary is released is some time for them to look back at all the legendaries and make their experience more consistent or complete.  (e.g. footfall length, projectile or attack effects (or lack there of), etc...)
---
I cleared it on Monday without any problem.
---
No, I didn't actually imply you're the only one playing P/P thief in instanced PvE. I implied that I always get rid of them. 
---
Dual pistols offer very crappy damage in an extended fight, especially for a daredevil. If you want dps on a daredevil, get staff. Pistol thief is very far from being the "most powerful build in the PVE"
---
What raptor skin is that?  Love the way you have it colored.  I can't seem to find one I like.
---
I have a guild, but sometimes people aren't online and I need to pug to get the dailies done.
---
Hmm, I think we can discuss this for a long time without commin to an end. :P
---
Okay, another point, what is about Tixx's Infinirarium? It's a huge airship, they could literally use it to fly over the Black Citadel and any other Charr city/outpost, out of the range of Charr's weapons and bomb them from above. Only counter would be the Charr copters and they don't really have weapons. 
---
A few more ships like this and the Asura could even live there (a bit like the Zepherites), completely out of the reach of the Charr.
---
Question  1) T4s?
---
Question 2) CMs?
---
If not, sure. You can basically carry standard fractals solo anyway if you wanted to. Im 100% positive people get hard carried all the time but think they are doing fine.
---
Source: DPS meter
---
Respect the shameless plug, but I've got a guild and not looking for another one. Just have to pug sometimes when we have less than 5 150+ AR people online since my schedule is weird and doesn't always match up with the guildies'.
---
Ahh.. The story of my life. 😓
---
Hmm, I'm pugging both CMs as healbrand since I figured most Druid healers can't even keep themselfes alive ^(even with 200+ kp ffs).
---
Its best you yourself bring absolute failsafe classes with a hugeass toolkit (Chrono/Guard) and bring power dps. Your personal performance does not matter too much and even dps classes should care about stability, vigor, reflection etc. uptime to **dupe** as many mechanics as possible.
---
Often times I see players not even changing their Weapons / Utilityskills for bossfights. I'd consider those the ultimate braindeds and I'm not even joking, they just 1:1 copy builds directly from snowcrows or discretize without reading the disclaimer and looking into their utilities.
---
Good, now I can't keep a cohesive look while I'm leveling a character or trying out new gear.
---
Was excited to see it listed on the news article, sad it’s a no show. Want it for my ranger with a dragon theme going on over the full dragon head helmet I’m using.
---
Hoping when dragon mount comes with new story, it’ll show up then and it was a early  announcement mistake. Not a lost dream and complete miss type
---
It's just the default raptor skin 😊 I think I dyed it with either redemption or preservance, I'm not sure though.
---
We were _just_ ready to do SH CM and we encountered this... :(
