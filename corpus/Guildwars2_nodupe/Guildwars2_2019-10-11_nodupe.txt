You know the 11 million players thing is a complete lie and they've only started saying that since NCSoft took over the marketing, right?
---

---
It's 11 million accounts... The amount of active players is *far, far below this* and you'd be a clown to think it's anywhere near 11 million. If you researched the sales at all over GW2's lifetime you'd know this.
---
The burden of evidence is on you to prove to us that this would be a good idea because all I'm seeing from you is "I really think it would work because capitalism" but you're obviously not very familiar with this game, Arenanet or the kind of people this game attracts. Account selling in GW2 is not a big market, end of story. Just look on Playerauctions - one of the most well known sites for this kind of thing. There's 21 accounts listed for sale right now for GW2. Let's compare that to Runescape; a game with a much smaller playerbase, 198 accounts listed. There is no demand, and there is already an outlet that makes them plenty of money.
---
And do you really think this would bode well with the existing playerbase? Hell no, they're not on the best of terms with the community right now and pulling this shit would just show as a last ditched pathetic act to squeeze the game dry before it's too late, because that's exactly it would be and that's your whole preface for this bs. I don't know why you think this is such a good idea.
---
I got a better idea: get player numbers up by having an amazing game that sees lots of content updates and marketing, sell more living story episodes/expansions and more crap in the Gemstore. It's a real doozy isn't it?
---
Give up dude, your idea is stupid.

What the fuck? I'm new to the game but I remember reading about people getting banned for buying shit with karma to resell for gold, using buttons and values devs put in themselves. I've never heard this stupid behaviour with the banhammer in any other game I've played. Blizzard might be sucking Winnie's peepee, but at least they are not *that* stupid.
---
I think one of the Problems ist that you are showing them the stuff, its way more natural Just exploring and figuring stuff Out by themselves, Like Most of US did Back in the day - everything ist explained, theres a reason why one Slot ist called enrichment and the Others Infusion Slot - Not saying i didnt Made that mistake a few years earlier. 
---
I know that you want to Play with them, nur If anybody would "Show" me everything, i would get overwehelmed pretty fast too.
---
It's more hassle to switch instruments now. Previously, you pressed weapon swap and double clicked on the item, both of those actions could be done simultaneously. Now you have to press the instrument keybind or click the tiny, tiny button, then open the hero panel, navigate to the top tab, then novelties, then instruments, then you can finally equip the instrument and then once again press the keybind or click the tiny, tiny button. 
---
I'd rather give up the shared inventory slots than deal with this.
---
Eh, while I agree that he could have been more considerate, I think you're overstating the harm done. Basically, you're nitpicking. Also, sure, it's on ArenaNet if there's a problem, but that doesn't mean it only affects them.
---
&gt;I was scared for my own account at this point because it wasn’t just 1 ticket in 10 where this happens. From my own experience it was around 90% of the tickets I opened. I could get any account at this point.
---
It literally could have affected everybody who played the game. It's not his *responsibility,* but that doesn't mean he can't do anything about it or isn't justified in trying to fix it.
---
Well fortunately that's why suits are tried in a courtroom, to determine if there is "enough" reason for damages to be awarded.
---
It would be pretty ass backwards for there to be a process for judging if a cause is "enough" to win before it gets to court. That's what court is for.
---
As a player who still clamours for that manifesto and still believe it is the "future" of the genre I must disagree with the conclusions that you reach when reading it.
---
When the manifesto speaks about storytelling it refers to the point with examples of the old dynamic event systems, where your choices had an impact on the map and how the maps were essentially designed with a good vs. bad map control aspect in mind (events either being attack or defense events for the control) so the PvE was in many ways designed like PvP (WvW).
---
That is the innovation that GW2 brought to the market. Anet managed to solve alot of the old problems that the prior generations in the genre never managed to solve. It brought in a PvE system that fit with WvW, that DAoC never managed, it solved the world bosses that Blizzard botched in WoW and it solved the quest-item competition from essentially every older MMO.
---
When it speaks of competetive play it speaks of WvW, nothing else, and it reiterates the points about the PvE/PvP overlap in PvE with cooperative play and open choices in how you wish to support and add to the effort. The social aspect as the key, playing socially but providing you with options in how to organize it.
---
When it speaks about combat it speaks about the flexibility of choices and the use of the combo systems and keeps referring to things like siege that are integral to WvW (PvP) but can also be used in map-control oriented PvE and storytelling through maps.
---
Now, if you look at the game from HoT and onward they have completely changed the direction of almost all of these design principles. The combat systems barely uses the combos anymore, much of the flexibility is gone since the creep and added complexity to the systems have been met with streamlining the choices. If you wish to play a certain way the choices in traits are becomming more obvious with every balance patch. Raiding and sPvP dominates the combat system choices and the competetive aspects of the game.
---
Attention changed from the open maps and telling stories on them into instanced content that is far less social and open. First the primary attention was raids and later the primary attention became the LW, expansion stories and the sagas. They have continued to churn out maps and boss events but they have not been the focal point of the story telling and most of the events on the maps are just grindy and farmy with little to no soul. The LW maps do not hold a candle to the old event maps and world bosses. Even the Strikes are a good technology but implemented from the wrong perspective as introductions to raids rather than expansions of world events.
---
WvW is the most underdeveloped mode in the game and has not seen much of anything. That it still primarily plays like vanilla release and is still plagued by it's noted #1 problems from the vanilla release should tell you everything. It has been given so little attention that when it is thrown the occassional crumbs, it is so completely out of touch with what the mode needs and its content-creators asks for that the players always come off as unhappy. Yet all they've ever gotten are watered-down recycled things from PvE that does not fit as well. The tracks are recycled, the items are recycled (and worse), the mounts are recycled (and worse) and the alliance system will be recycled (because it essentially is megaservers or a lesser version that will not capitalize on the overflow technology etc., so the "new" system will still have queues and other outdated functions). So, what do they have to be happy about? Getting lesser versions of recycled content later, to a lesser degree and at much longer intervals? The day-1 problems and #1 problems remain.
---
Essentially all my gripes with GW2 comes from how they have betrayed that design manifesto and simultainously, that I remain in the game, still care enough to post and still consider GW2 one of the best games that I have played is entirely thanks to what little remains of the ideas in that design manifesto.
---
He would have been asked for proof of the tickets, and anet would have, again, stated that he went"cs rep shopping".
---
"Hard" is subjective.
---
Some people find something that requires multiple different button presses hard, while others may not. This is actually a non-factor, because there's only so many buttons used for any given class - the only difference being f1-f5 (some use 1 while others use 5).
---
Some people find it hard to press buttons in quick succession, especially in a given order. This is what your DPS rotations are heavily impacted by (especially on certain builds). This can easily be addressed through the development of muscle memory and practice, unless you're handicapped in some manner (unfortunate if you are).
---
Some people find thinking on the spot and adapting to a given situation in order to use the appropriate skills hard. This is something you have no control over. You're either quick witted, or you're not - the best you can do is be awake and alert when playing. You can practice all you want, but if you're slow at making judgement, you will always lack in a live scenario.
---
So, at the end of the day, the only class that can be argued to be "hard", with no way for you to address the problem of it being "hard"...is thief. Every other class that is "hard" can be easily mastered. Thief takes the highest amount of skill level, because to actually master it, you need to be quick witted. If you don't care about mastering a class, then sure...you can claim one of the other classes to be "hard" based on how many different button presses it takes or how quick you need to press said buttons for a DPS rotation. I'm talking about changing live scenarios by the way - not pre-programmed encounters...because that's the real test of a class and your skill. This is also evident when you look at any better than average thief player. They are all able to very quickly pick up and learn other classes, and adapt to any situation.
---
He could have reached out to GW2 streamers or other partners, you don't think Mighty Teapot would have talked to this guy? Of course he would have.
---
Sorry but the person is also at fault. He pretended to be someone he wasn't to gain access to many accounts. He deleted items on those accounts or gave stuff away. He was abbrasive with people in chat as well as a number of other things. This person is not a saint or even a good person. Even after all the court happening he went back and did it again recently, proving this person hasn't grown up or learned their lesson. I am not saying Anet is in the right for not fixing their system and more training for their reps, of course that needs to be addressed. But for very good reasons they tried to take him to court and have him charged.
---
I never understood how it *couldn't* be regenerated.
---
I'd prefer it if they took a page from DE's book and just said, "eh, fuck it".  DE's incredibly unprofessional (I mean, their dev streams tend to have all kinds of innuendo) but people love them for it.  Why? Because it makes them seem like normal people.  Granted, only a handful of DE's team regularly interact with people and there is one dev in particular that people don't like, but that gets overshadowed by how outgoing they make themselves appear.  For the most part people really like DE, even despite the shortcomings, blunders, nonsensical changes, and so forth.
---
Additionally, DE isn't afraid to make jokes about themselves, isn't afraid to show their behind-the-scenes stuff sometimes years in advance, and have somehow managed to teach their community that "soon" = "Soon™" = "Might come this month, might come tomorrow, might come two years from now.  We're working on it though, we promise." All this transparency has lead to people understanding what's going through the dev teams head, which means that changes are better received, even if they aren't the changes people want.
---
Finally, DE actually pays attention to their players and admits when they've fucked up.
---
It's amazing how far you people go to excuse Arenanet's completely atrocious communication efforts. Look at literally any other company that delivers an mmo or a "live service" game and you'll realise what a massive joke they are in this department.
---
To be honest, the estimate of &lt;100 is probably lowballing it significantly. Literally all you had to do to get banned was have another person logged into their Windows account and not run the game as an administrator. The game would try to hash exe's and dll's it didnt have permission to and return the null hash, resulting in a ban. That's common enough of a situation to believe a *significant* number of those bans were in error.
---
They didn't actually unban them. The ban lasted 6 months. They tried to not give up the hash, but the person persisted with threatening legal action even after the ban had expired. So all they did was say sorry and give a few gems (which was worth little more than the login rewards from that time period?). Also, they never gave numbers on how many accounts were banned in error. If it was a small number, they would have, because it would make the issue look less major. The situation that lead to the false ban was common enough that it was likely a significant number of the total bans. Sure, it's speculation, but hundreds is probably the most accurate estimate.
---
And they fought the GDPR request until after the 6 month bans timed out naturally, anyway. Those players weren't unbanned as a result of GDPR, since the ban was already over. They got an apology and a few gems.
---
Imo there are no hard professions to play. Basically they are all the same but thanks to the unique traits and playstyle u can squeeze out from each one something unique. If u ask about hardest to master i would say probably weaver because of very low gap for mistakes and their multi attunement mixing nature.

B.S.  Also he loved Anet, he loved them so much he fraudulently gained access to Gailes account and did all the things he did out of love. BULL.
---
I don't know where you are from but 19 is an adult. I guess this does depend on where you live. Even at 23 he doesn't think he did anything wrong. So he's still not an adult? Immaturity is not a defense for breaking the rules. 
---
Also I don't have it backwards. This is not some 13 year old kid. This was a 19 year old who knew exactly what he was doing, went out of his way to prove that he could gain access to these account, trash one account and then was lucky the laws are the way they are in Germany.  You're damned right they should go after him. It's not vindictive, it's protecting your company. He didn't do them a favor as many people seem to think. 
---
I guess it's a good thing that Anet didn't win the case because they've be even bigger villians then
---
He was justified, just a little immature. He was worried about the security of his account. If he'd jumped immediately to hacking Gaile Gray's account and deleting items and acting rude, I'd agree that he was way out of line. You're trying to take the moral high ground and judge him to shift the attention away from ArenaNet's faults.
---
Similar to you, I jumped back into gw2 after both HoT and PoF were released. This meant I missed seasons 2 &amp; 3. There were a lot of things that caught me by surprise because I was missing details from the LS seasons. I read about them after the fact and eventually bought the story to completely fill in the blanks. There was also the extra mastery points I got from the LS chapter which helped expeediate those masteries. If you can't spend the money, play the main stories now and read the wiki. Also, find someone to guide you through the main story unless you are looking for a challenge.

You can but most squads will ask for no mounts except for transport back to group if you fall behind. Which means no mount engage.

Sorry not at all justified. I call 100% BS on being worried about the security of his account. I am not trying to shift attention from Anet at all. Anet is at fault for poor training , hiring, and allowing this to continue for as long as it did. When you find these flaws you fix them as soon as possible. Anet are not the good guys here either. 
---
Did he make some attempts to get their attention? Yes. But the solution he came to was a horrible one, and after all that is said and done he went and tried to do it again, and then was shocked when the blocked his accounts. Of course they did!
---
Did you ever get this resolved?
---
Still working with support to get it fixed.
---
I have no love for Blizzard anymore. I feel that the people that brought me the epic dramas of Jim Raynor, Thrall, Deckard Cain and others have long since been drown out by an apologetic corporate agenda.
---
Your brain isn't fully developed until you're 25. It's reasonable to expect 19 year olds to act like adults, but the immaturity of him venting when he got access to Gaile's account is not unexpected. And I'm saying you've got it backwards because you're judging ArenaNet by lower standards than a 19 year old. Yes, that's unreasonable. We're not going to agree on that, though, because you don't realize how leniently you're judging ArenaNet. There's no real point in arguing that, though, because it's not going to go anywhere. I hope you can just try to see this from another perspective.

Interacting with a game - however you interact - is content. You may not ENJOY the content, but it IS content.

I don't think I'm overstating anything. I should be the one to decide if my account is used to demonstrate a problem. Someone else shouldn't get to decide that for me. It's not about "harm," it's about freedom of choice. Let's say, theoretically, I didn't care about an issue that negatively affects me. Why should I feel it is justified for someone else to use something I own to spark a beneficially change that I didn't care about in the first place? That would be a case of helping someone who didn't want to be helped, and justifying it by saying "it's for their own benefit." Let people know about an issue, but don't force someone to be directly involved if they would prefer to remain passive.

Maybe it's overly idealistic, but I'm not someone who believes the end always justifies the means, and in this particular case, I believe there were other avenues left unexplored that could have been pursued. The writer of this article mentioned he could have went directly to the press, in which case they would have brought the issue to ArenaNet's attention on his behalf and possibly even publish articles about this issue to apply public pressure before it got to the point it did. Why wasn't this option explored by Lynie?

Well obviously you plain suck.

Here's my response to a similar question. In case you don't want to read the whole thing, let me pose a question to you. If he approached a news site and they published an article about it before ArenaNet fixed the problem, wouldn't he be somewhat responsible if accounts were stolen by people who took the article as a roadmap? The outcome then could be worse, with the same thing that happened to Gaile's account happening to countless players. How is that better?
---
I agree with everything that you said honestly. I would like to add though that in my opinion I think the concept of stealth is pretty self-explanatory and I don't really think there is much to learn with it other than how to apply it, and when to use it. It should be common sense that if you see your player and party members with a see-through silhouette that you're stealthed, and if you see everyone running past a cluster of mobs then it should also be common sense to follow suit with them rather than attack them by yourself.
---
I dunno, I just don't people.
---
Combat is action-based.  Characters can move while using most abilities.  You need timing to activate your universal dodge to avoid incoming attacks/damage.
---
I assume that means combat is more like Tera than FFXIV, though I haven't played Tera to confirm that.  With that said, the base game for Guild Wars 2 is free to play, so if you can make the download, you can try it out for yourself.

---
The point is that you're judging him with hindsight and still can't definitively decide on a better solution. It's possible that there was another way to do it, but it's not unreasonable that he went with his solution seeing how many avenues were shut down to him by ArenaNet's obstinance. And that stubbornness could negatively effect many innocent customers. Let me try to draw a comparison. 
---
The April banwave banned a bunch of players for the null hash. If you submitted support tickets, they told you they were confident and wouldn't double check, then closed future tickets without a response. Even as a partner, I was ghosted by my dev contacts and couldn't even get a response on the issue. Now here's the question. What if the GDPR didn't exist, and the player who proved his innocence did so by hacking ArenaNet and stealing the data around his ban? They didn't ask him to prove their mistake, after all. He tried to prove himself innocent legitimately, but ArenaNet cut off all such avenues. As long as he doesn't do anything with irrelevant data, I would consider him in the right.
---
Now, the difference here is that it would be in response to ArenaNet's incompetence harming him, rather than worry over it happening in the future. But trying to prevent an issue from being abused before it causes more harm, in the long run, causes less harm. It's a case where "the ends justifies the means," but only because he didn't have any ethical means in the first place. Pragmatically speaking, "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." You might not think like that, but that doesn't make it wrong.
---
This all breaks down if you think he should have just accepted his ban instead of hacking ArenaNet to get the hash and prove his innocence, though. In that case, I just have to say I disagree.

Yea, Manaworks have 8 listed employees, of whom 4 worked at Anet, based on [this page](https://mana.works/About.html) and the Anet staff list on the wiki. Suffice to say, it's a few less than all of them.

it's not inevitable in every game and some games can even do it well, like CoD4 or Spec Ops The Line, but those games aren't explicitly *about* politics

Another reason to not do this, is if you don't want to power creep the initial progression experience of Heart of Thorns. Mounts trivialize the game and earlier areas in many ways. There is something to be said about the fun in playing through Heart of Thorns properly, as it was when it was released. I only wish I could reset my progress on masteries on a given "hardcore mode character" or something, so I could play through the experience all over again.

I am judging him with everything we now know from that article. I've said the solutions I would have tried and even if those did not work I still would not have stolen access to someone else's account. I do not believe doing the wrong this is right or justified. Not in this case.
---
His disappointment with Anet not willing to act (in which they are in the wrong) does not give him the right to gain access to other peoples accounts. Every account he did this to there are victims to what he did. Regardless of weather or not he did anything harmful to their accounts. I don't want him in my account, he does not have permission to do so. And in Gailes case he did cause harm.
---
You seem to be judging him to lightly but that is up to you and not me. 
---
As far as your banwave goes. Again I am sorry that happened to you and I am sorry that is happened to a lot of other people. It is silly and was silly then to assume on Anets part they could do no wrong. They very fallible both in past and present. And they should apologize to you and anyone else effect in this way, and in fact I think they should go even further with some gem compensation. 
---
In regards to you being a partner that is even worse. You should be able to get a response, they should double if not triple check, you have a signed contract with them and I believe that more should have been done. In fact I think I remember talking to you about it and it's total BS.
---
All of that being said, it's still no OK to hack your account back, or social engineer it back. Anet is in the wrong, they refuse to listen. But you can go breaking or bending rules just because they are being A holes about it. I mean you used the word stealing in there, it's just not ok.
---
You and I and others in here simple disagree on the ends justify the means, You say it's ok, and I say that it isn't. In this case or the case that you've given above I do not think it's ok to hack, or social engineer or whatever you want to call it in order to prove a point. And even if it was he went too far with it by acting the way in which he did by deleting items, giving items out, trying to ban people, cursing and swearing and generally acting in a non professional way on a professional account in order to get his way and because he was upset with his supposedly beloved company. 
---
I am not excusing Anet, and they shouldn't be. But what he did isn't right either. In my opinion he wasn't and isn't a child, he knew what he was doing and he was doing it on purpose because people wouldn't listen or believe him.

Do you have sources to back your claim up? As the number of edges increases, an n gon approximates a circle, but I don't think that "an n gon with infinite sides IS a circle" is a true statement and couldn't find anything to prove that it is.

Warrior bucaneer.  Weapon: pistols.
---
A support specialization that  uses tricks. It has a number of grog skill that heals and give both vulnerability and might.  hook skills that pull enemies to the warrior and pulls the warrior to a ground target area. A cannon barrage ult and a group stealth+swiftness.
---
Vampire Necro using dual swords. His shroud becomes a blood gauge that is constantly drained to recover his health.   Sword skills are all about teleporting in, cc'ing bursting a moderate amount of damage + giving heavy bleed stacks and then teleptorting out. Bleeding stacks near the vampire conceeds might and life force.    Vampiric skills are all about evasion and metamorphosis (becoming mist, turning into wolf, summoning a cloud of bats and teleporting to Target area.)

I like this idea allot!

I think they had a few gemstore sales, but actual sale on the game itself.. never happened yet during black friday afaik
---
As former IT, I sympathize. I know some people take the approach that anyone finding the post-it has physical access, and physical access makes everything else meaningless, but *some* minimal barrier to temptation is important.
---
Otherwise, your shit is definitely getting photographed and sold before Friday.

Literally anything at this point.

The POF upgrade contains both Heart of Thorns (the first expansion) and obviously Path of Fire. That purchase does not include Living World seasons that aren't the current free released episodes.

---
Buy PoF and you get heart of thorns for free. You will need to buy the living world seasons separately.
---
Thanks. So is the Path of Fire Standard for 29.99 the cheapest way to upgrade? Or any cheaper way to upgrade from Core to POF?
---
If this is the case, I'm thinking I can just make a new account and buy that so I'll have a 'core' account I can give away to a cousin or something.
---
Currently that is the cheapest. Since it includes the HOT expansion I doubt it would go on sale anytime soon. Until recently both expansions were 29.99. So you can look at it as 15 per expansion.
---
This was really an amazing read, kudos to the writer.
---
&gt; Content =/= "stuff to do'.
---
funny that you say I'm wrong without explaining why that is. "stuff to do" was my opinion on what content is, you might not agree with that but you should at least explain why you think my opinion is wrong.
---
So, I ask: What is content if it is not something you can do in the game? Because no game that was ever created had any content.
---
Can you elaborate more on this?!
---
That could easily be a grandmaster trait in beast mastery rather than a whole new elite spec. Visually augmenting traits are the fun and flavorful.

I own a small yet international software development outfit and we got a complaint from a recent client that they keep getting hacked. So I took my whitehats and started looking for holes. We couldnt find any that would result in altered data they were describing. So we had an experiment. We created an email from thisisfake@insertobviouslyfakedomainhere.com pretending to be HR and stuck their company logo. We asked them for names, addresses, phone numbers, pin keys to the software and even ridiculous crap like number of children in their household, how many times they go to church, etc. Guess what, 93% responded among 200 employees using the system.
---
With Halloween coming up whats the best way and best class to farm the labyrinth?
---
it's fine, not the best but it works. There's no real nonviable classes in PvE, but some do perform better than others. There are builds for each class that aren't really great for PvE, but the same can't be said for the entire class overall
---
Is there any way on gw2wiki to look for changes history by whole profession instead of per ability or patchnote?
---
To be fair, this particular situation is due to a recent exodus of guilds from SF (of which my guild was part of) which has left the server lacking in troops.
---
I just hope they'll again go creative and won't just slap a focus/staff to engi and call it a Golemancer. This is such a boring idea that screams "another spec with broken AI!"
---
Live by the warclaw, die by the warclaw is what I believe. And now, as melee preferred class you can reliably have a shot at dismounting someone instead of having to go play pew pew.
---
I just wanna point out that this post isn't about the manifesto, and that the manifesto is just used as a *tangible past example* of the company having communication that backfired on them. If you would prefer, I could use the [Cab Advertisement Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uk717LQnpVE) or the [Live Action Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Noh81HcovYY) that's 2 minutes long, with only about 30 seconds of it related to the game itself.
---
But those are *advertisement* faux pas, and they're not related. The manifesto is an example of ArenaNet trying to communicate their plans and intent to the players. It was a failed attempt, but failed attempts at communication provide context for the **lack** of communication we're facing now.
---
Yeah I know it was older, but it describes how to circumvent Apple's move towards making it more difficult to run programs that aren't downloaded from the App store. It took me a while to discover where the setting was, and this article does a good job. I didn't get the standard "trust the developer" popup when I clean installed GW2, so this may be a new "feature" in Catalina.
---
And FWIW, I'm not getting CoherentUI\_Host crashes now that I've done a clean install of the GW2 App.
---
Arenanet: exist

Bored plahers: "is this drama?"
---
I'm not entirely sure about it because I haven't kept up with it that well lately, however I think I remember them resolving the issue with the chat mods, but kickbot's chat filter is still an issue because that's run by the dev I mentioned.  Afaik aside from that one dev most people like warframe's dev team.  
---
I mean, I'm not trying to make it sound like DE's perfect, sorry if I've given that impression, it's just that I personally like their style of communication and it seems like a lot of other people do too.  When they do fuck up it seems like it has a tendency to blow over fairly quickly.
---
Will you ever open them or did you already said "f that" and created a new char?
---
I wouldn’t worry about it too much. The most recent story chapter was my fav since ... the story began.
---
Does firebrand with radiance traitline get fire tome recharge on kill in labyrinth?
---
This is pretty off-topic, but I am a founder on Design Council, and I can confirm that while a lot of people are disillusioned, the game is still massively successful-- and not in a MTX sense, but in a player count sense. Tons and tons of people still play Warframe regularly, and then you have the Mayfly players like myself who play the heck out of a major update (Like Fortuna for instance), then stop and come back whenever another big batch of new content has accrued, or when they see something limited-time they absolutely want. Warframe like GW2 has massive player spikes when something new comes out, and dips in the content droughts. The lack of entry price nearly guarantees a large chunk of people come back each time though.
---
While reading your post I had a craving for McDonald’s
---
Just because you hear of people leaving does not mean that new ones are not coming in. It is important so tell the community if a important member of the dev team that interacted with the community a lot leaves, but know one in the community cares that a Mr. Smith starts at Arenanet.
---
So I read it all and it wouldn't surprise me one bit I'd they actually did it. I also read the comment about the Voldemort exploit. I wonder what happened with that exploit.

You may not get as much reward as a Scourge that has a a huge AoE damage/tagging potential but as far as I remember Anet tried (and succeeded in some extent) to help healer/support roles get more reward that only what they tagged themselves.
---
One thing that can help you though is to use your F1 tome skill 5 (and sometimes 4) to increase a bit your tagging potential but be careful that it does not come at the cost of you forgetting to support your group in a key moment :p
---
That's the game though
---
How so? Do you have a build?
---
A Renegade is definitely not a Ritualist wtf? It's not even NEAR the concept
---
You might be right, but here is the thing, a lot of misunderstandings are happening because people don't make themselves clear or others understand what they want to understand.
---
And, you know what, if you go deeper into the rabbit hole then "running endlessly in a circle" is something the players have created to maximize profit, not ArenaNet. Which means that Players actually created "not good content".
---
Still, some players might enjoy it because they do it the first time and can still work for something they enjoy or want in the game, is that suddenly not "good" or not content at all for them?
---
That is why I asked, "what is content then?" because from the different replies I got is it is only (good) content if you can play it endlessly and you like it.
---
Me and a friend both experience this when we play the game on fullscreen on the same type of MacBooks. A workaround is setting it to windowed.
---
Yeah exactly. "Oh no, I have to selectively restore a backup, this is all arcane sorcery and I cannot possibly fathom how to do this!" &lt;-- said no serious DB admin or support ever.
---
Nothing in particular. I'm also not sure why there needs to be the attempt to throw PvE under the bus either. The same reasons that the poster is giving for Thief being difficult in PvP absolutely apply to instanced PvE. As a profession, Thief is very reliant on encounter knowledge, positioning, timing and awareness to perform at its highest level - the same things that are suggested to make Thief hard in PvP.
---
For what it is worth, as much as I love Thief and especially Deadeye, there are Elementalist and Weaver meta builds that are more challenging in PvE.
---
This might work in the US, but while IANAL I'm fairly certain that over here in Germany you need a verifiable way to gain profit from the fraud for it to be considered that. Plus, importantly, the intent of doing exactly that.
---
For the most part he caused virtual-only "damage" to an in-system virtual account. That is to say, you could ban him from the game for it, as the company running it. That's without your permission to do, after all it probably violates something in the EULA. But he didn't interface with the outside of the game - for example, he didn't try to sell the account for profit! Hence, no fraud. No **actual** damage was caused.
---
Heal the raid encounters to death!
---
oh damn, so i need to buy a 3rd slot for professions? ouch
---
Because he didn't try to be "Gaile Gray, the person". He tried to be "Gaily Gray, or whoever is the owner of account XYZ in this virtual game you're running there".
---
There's no attempt to take over Gaile's **identity**, just a virtual account in an online entertainment system. As a result, there's no actual damage caused to Gaile's ability to exist online (as a person) or the company's ability to conduct business (that is, selling video game boxes and services). He didn't take down their online store, he didn't burn their boxes from the store shelves, and he didn't change Gaile's home address or vehicle license registration or something like that.
---
Its nice but please remove the aegis on guards while mounted or it doesnt make any sense.
---
Great read, I like your solution to the pillars
---
I just want them to bring back bonder/prot monks in some way, one of the most unique classes I've ever played in any game.
---
Again, Germany not the US. He only choose person X to impersonate insofar that this person happened to be the owner of the account he wanted access to. And importantly that account had no actual monetary value.

---
Basically, keep clones out and spam ambush attacks on greatsword using the Infinite Horizon trait that makes your clones ambush when you do. 
---
Greatsword has decent range, pierces and has a two-beam ambush. This means that every time you ambush, eight laser beams appear and tag a load of enemies with a reasonable amount of damage. 
---
Mirage mirrors really help, so equip skills and traits that drop them and take Domination 221. The hardest part is avoiding the ~1.5-second cooldown.
---
Paragon was a heavy armor class, if I don't remember incorrectly. And Dervish was medium. Also, they were Nightfall campaign additions.
---
So while I also would like to see those professions make a comeback, I don't find it all that likely, as we're moving away from the Desert with the coming Icebrood Saga. And even if they were to implemented again, they'll probably not be for the classes you picked. Rather the opposite, actually.
---
Meanwhile my account has just been suspended for 48 hours for an "unacceptable name" when I have no inappropriate character names.

Yes, I've seen all those videos. All of them were possible thanks to jump-dismount trick - when you pressed jump and dismount at the same time (like in dodge-jumping), you gained a bit more height. It is not possible to do ever since 1st of October.
---
I don't really care about 'what was in Lynnie's head'. I am more interested in what was in ArenaNet's Head's head while they ignored the concerns and proceed to persecute a 19 year old (he was not a teenager).
---
Two alarm clocks and eight screen brightness? Yeah I'm casual.
---
Hah, I can bet!
---
Was season 1 the one with the LA changes? I dont remember. Because then its not possible since LA was not instanced. It was an open world event.
---
Lmao!
---
More or less. You rather circle around the outposts and try to get all events and open chests on the way from event to event.
---
Yeah, that's gonna be a can't unsee.
---
If OP reads this: There is no best race and class combo, all profession/race combinations for a single profession are equally strong.
---
The minimum is to remove trinkets and if possible not have ascended weapons (because of the weapon strength increase) but don't go buy exo weapons just for a festival if you only have the Ascended version.
---
If you have non-offensive stats on some armor/trinkets then you can keep them but if you have some Marauder, Zerk, Assassin, etc it's better to reduce how much you have equipped (don't go buying defensive gear just for this though, just do with what you have).
---
Then if possible going full naked with just the weapons is great for others (you can pop an outifit on if you don't want your character to catch a cold :p) but can make the big legendaries more annoying to do if your group is killing them (iirc the best farm tactics do not kill it to maximise trash or only kill them when there are no other door around for a bit).
---
A harlequin mesmer with daggers. Instead of spamming clones like any other mesmer build, this one would have only one clone that is present whenever the spec is equipped like a ranger pet.
---
The mesmer would be able to have decent amount of control over the clone, switch places and health with the clone, and have clone generating skills interact with it in unique ways, like healing it or making it deal damage depending on traits chosen.
---
All power based with off builds that could make it more durable and cc heavy.
---
I don't know if f2p cav use lfg but if you can, there's almost always a squad called RIBA that's three to farm.  Good luck!

Are there any Domain of Anguish (GW1) minis in gw2? Bosses, creatures, etc...
---
I had one, it got stolen from storage tho
---
My friend owes me £20 and is going to buy me some gems for GW2. Where can he buy them legitimately? Thanks.
---
I was feeling bad about my banks, now im fine.
---
Must be common. Sword broke from mine too..
---
You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like
---
It is more because of us hearing only when important people, people with names leave. Surely there are more mundane employees leaving as well, but these won't have established twitters and won't be recognized. 
---
We do as well hear about important people coming in, but there are obviously aren't nearly as many of those. I think I can remember two such cases over the last  2-3 years plus one jessica price.

Awww

Dual pistol Mesmer with a Gambling Theme.  It's bursting skills are removed and are replaced by Ace's. Each Ace, when activated, creates a clone that pulses buffs, debuffs, healing or deals aoe damage.  When a Ace is active, enemies destroying a clone that isn't the Ace heals the Mesmer, deals some damage and inflicts aoe vulnerability. While an ace is active, destroying clones that aren't the Ace immediately spawn another clone in the vicinity.
---
Maverick's skills are deceptions. His healing, "one up the sleeve", puts him in hide and spawns clones. For each clone destroyed while in hide, the character is healed for an additional amount and the cool down of the healing skills is slightly reduced.
---
"All in" reduces the damage of the character by 90% but gives a buff to a random clone that makes it deal a huge amount of damage. When all in is activate, the character and all the clones start doing the very same rotation of 5 pistol attacks.
---
"Bluff" prevents all damage the character would take for a few seconds and exchanges his location with a clone if hit by an attack. If an ace is activated, hitting a the character with bluff is considered the same as hitting a clone.
---
&gt; Well, you're free to have opinions about anything you like, but in math, something is either true or false, whether you agree or disagree with it is irrelevant.
---
So is 0 a natural number or not?
---
You can certainly have opinions on a lot of things in mathematics, usually definitions.
---
By the definitions I learned a circle is not an object that can have edges. Edges are something a polytope - in 2D a polygon - can have. A polygon is an object that can have an arbitrary (but finite) number of edges. Sure, a circle can be the limit of a series of regular n-gons with vanishing edge length for n -&gt; ∞, so you may call it a "∞-gon" if you want, but a "∞-gon" is not a polygon, just like 1 is not in the open interval (0,1), even though it can be approximated by the series 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ... (which is equivalent to saying 1 = 0.9999...).
---
Now if you want to extend the definition of the number of edges from polygons to a circle, funny things start to happen because you can argue [one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogon) just as well as [infinty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apeirogon).
---
TL;DR: Infinity is weird. A circle with infinite radius is a line.
---
**Monogon**
---
In geometry, a monogon is a polygon with one edge and one vertex. It has Schläfli symbol {1}. Since a monogon has only one side and only one vertex, every monogon is regular by definition.
---
***
---
**Apeirogon**
---
In geometry, an apeirogon (from the Greek word ἄπειρος apeiros, "infinite, boundless" and γωνία gonia, "angle") is a generalized polygon with a countably infinite number of sides. It can be considered as the limit of an n-sided polygon as n approaches infinity. The interior of a linear apeirogon can be defined by a direction order of vertices, and defining half the plane as the interior.
---
This article describes an apeirogon in its linear form as a tessellation or partition of a line.

Pelt Collector Druid. A shapeshifiting tanky build in which the character can change forms by doing specific "pelts". Each pelt would work like an Engineer kit, changing all 5 weapon skills and making the character model turn into the animal's model. Instead of Cooldowns each pelt would have have it's own hp pool that would be shown as % on the skill icon when the form is deactivated. 
---
The pelt Collector would use rifle which would be a long range CC, condition damage weapon with skills that allowed the pelt Collector to disengage and heal up his pelts.
---
The ultimate would be a werewolf transformation capable of inflicting fear, inflicting heavy vulnerability to a single "prey" as well as shadow dash and get barriers and alacrity as it dealt damage. The werewolf pelt go constantly drained like a timer being extremely powerful but have very short duration.
---
Each pelt provided a kit for a style of.play. Naja pelt would be ranged Condition Damage, tiger pelt would be melee power damage, stag pelt would be aoe healing / buffing and Buffalo pelt would be cc/tanking. Each pelt comes with a "passive" that makes equalizes the highest attribute of the character with the appropriate attribute for the pelt while the transformation is active. This would allow pelt Hunter to be a great generalist.
---
Keep it and don't open it.
---
Give it like 5-10 years and this will be a real collectors item because the servers will either be dead or in maintenance mode and the company will either be on life support or dead increasing the value of this item.

Complaining on Reddit is hardly apathetic.

We had a really big security breach half a year ago in our company network. Someone was clicking on a link that redirected him to a "Microsoft Sharepoint" page with our companies logo and everything. He tried to log in but nothing happened because, the site was not real. In the next 2 weeks, we had thousands of mails going out from his company account, sharing the same link. It was also send to customers. As a former IT guy I was really happy, that I don't need to deal with that BS. But our IT contractor was also not really helping.
---
IT started to do online workshops on how to detect and identify phishing mails. To little success I might add. The test mail send out one day after we had the training, was clicked by 44% of our employees worldwide. So it was clear, people just don't care about their account security. This goes now on since months with test mail after test mail. But people still fall for it.
---
This week, our IT contractor reviewed all of their AD security groups. We use SharePoint as world wide fileserver. On Tuesday, after they changed something on the groups, I noticed that I have not only read access but OWNER access on all HR folders. I work in Operations, not HR... So, that's a bit of an issue in my book. I called our CIO and demonstrated him what happened. A lot of people had access to private information considering all of our employees, including salaries, bonus, contracts and so on. With our CIO's  permission, I downloaded all of the data to a spare notebook and deleted the HR folder from our Sharepoint. Of course it didn't took long for someone to complain that the data is gone, but our external IT contractor only restored the data without questioning what actually happened. Our CIO didn't even get a note from them, that something odd had happen. So we did it again and the same thing happened. They restored it. They didn't even check who deleted it or if data was downloaded. Just restore and close the ticket.
---
We went one step further and asked our intern to call IT, requesting to get access to confidential customer contracts. The call was done in 2 minutes and she had access to everything. They just granted an intern, who works for this company for only 2 weeks now, not only full access to confidential data, but they also granted her "Owner" rights. So again, like I was able to delete the HR folder, she was able to delete the customer contract folder.
---
This is how a professional IT Support contractor, we pay A LOT of money for every month, handled our IT security. Well, at least this is how they did up until now, because they won't do it for much longer.
---
And if you find a bug you'd better not report it since ANet will ban you (https://youtu.be/0bY_pPslgPE). Not that it matters since apparently customer support can give your account to someone asking for it with minimal effort (https://massivelyop.com/2019/10/10/guild-wars-2-studio-arenanet-chased-the-2016-gaile-gray-account-hacker-all-the-way-to-germany-and-lost/).
---
But hey, the ringleader of the circus known as ArenaNet has recently founded his own studio (https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/a-message-from-mike-obrien/) along with several other veterans so things might be starting to improve!
---
Might, or might not, since the future of the game seems to have only a single player storyline while most of the multiplayer features have been "coming soon" for a while now and no talks of a possible expansion have been made.
---
dude i shared this on fb for you,....its fking epic!  &lt;3
---
Like players have mentioned, usually there are  alternative events for the bugged events.
---
I did play through almost all of season one, but studying for getting in uni got in the way. So a reminder while not necessary could be useful.
---
But the videos about builds could be useful and since i just got back I'm thinking about boosting a character of a different class.
---
I don't know what's more disguting: that ArenaNert fanboys want to delete anything that makes the studio look even slightly bad, or that they're used to getting what they want thanks to the facist state that the official forums are.
---
Thankfully reddit has a far better moderation than the forums.
---
 I am from Belarus and my second native language is Russian. But I can't understand what is problem?  
---
 When I play any game with my russian speaking friends we always use  discord. It's more comfortable and faster than writing in chat.   
---
 We even use discord when we play russian version WoW. And not only us, as I know everybody use discord or teamspeak.  
---
 Why you didn't want to use discort too?  
---
 Why should everything be as you want?   
---
 This game was not originally intended for Russian speakers, and when you bought it you knew it.
---
IMHO  
---
 I think it’s not a matter of convenience here, just someone wants to be  known as a “hero”, because he has not become famous a streamer and  because the Arena.net doesn’t give him "cookies" for streaming GW 2.   
---
 Нe often "cries" in his videos about that. It's enough to look at his videos.   
---
 Very interesting was his reaction to Ork-podcaster's video about GW2.  
---
 This was a poorly concealed envy that one Orc-podcaster's video  generated more interest to GW2 than all Mr. Inoy’s videos. It was after  this that Mr. Inoy decided to make a fuss about the Cyrillic alphabet in  the game, but not a year, two or three ago.  
---
 And now, when Mr. Inoy has not received an answer, because he is too  lazy to seek an answer on the forums, he wants a personal answer, Mr.  Inoy decided to arrange, as he says, an unauthorized rally in the game  itself. ( 📷 )  
---
 A great decision is to go where you weren’t invited and do something  disgusting, as a result of which they can block all Russian-speaking  players, regardless of their desire to have a Cyrillic in the game chat.
---
Maybe someone from Arena.net can explain Mr. Inoy personally why it  is impossible to add cyrillic to chat of GW2 and gives him some  "cookies"?
---
I'll try to convert gold since i have some laying around and get S3 and 4 while there's a discount.

Is the main story really that hard that I'll need a friend?

Ah, you mean the phase quite a lot of people had years ago, called Anet out on and then got shit on by fanbois on the subreddit?
---
Already complete forgot about that.
---
Same is happening over in Destiny 2 with Bungie leaving Activision Blizzard and changed their game model to f2p and their ingame store went from the mainfocus for skins to pretty much the main-mainfocus for skins.

I agree that we need a roadmap.

Decided to try and do it in order.

I remember there were many that did it a handful of times and didn't get banned, up to like 10-15 times and just kept everything. Possibly the ANet employees fell in that range
---
It is not the best gold farm in game but it is the easiest. And also fast leveling for players who want to make a new character.
---
Do mind though it is a grind and how much time you spend there depends on how much you can take without your brain giving up :D
---
I care more about protecting my account management than my ingame assets, though.
---
For some reason, my Arcdps only shows cleave... so I see on the target DPS only "0" for everyone (and it sort like that randomly). Any Solution on how to fix that?
---
2 69’s that sounds like an orgy to me
---
Daaamn, why I did not read this yesterday =(.
---
Yo why this guy hack the account in the first place?
---
I definitely agree that their policy of silence hurts more than it helps. They need to start telegraphing at least *some* of their decisions months before they get locked into stone. Even with the recent balance patches, where they announce their plans a week or two in advance, have they *ever* actually changed any of those plans based on feedback? I think it's too soon to release for them to do so. 
---
I would REALLY like a genuine dialog on balance changes. I don't want "here's what we're doing, deal with it," I want "here's what we are *thinking* of doing, **what do you guys think about that?"** and then genuinely listening to what is said in response. 
---
If they still think they have the right course, *explain* why it is right, and what the community is missing, and listen to the response to *that.* Be open to having their mind changed, and adapt. 
---
If there are technical reasons why they wanted to do something, but couldn't make it work, like the pilotable tanks in the last patch, then let players know. "We *planned* to have this work a certain way, we *told* you about it, but then we tried it and it didn't work like either of us thought it would, so here's what we're doing *instead."*
---
Just keep us in the loop.
---
&gt;Isn't the last friday in november "black friday"?
---
Usually, but not always. Black Friday is the day after US Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is always the 4th Thursday in November. If the first day of November falls on a Thursday (as it did last year), then black Friday is not the last Friday of the month.
---
alright will try that too, thanks for the information :)

When you do the silverwastes RIBA farm, you open all the bags you get with a lvl 49 character, then sell the materials you gain.
---
If you open the bags with a lvl 80 character you will get differemt materials that are worth "nothing".
---
Which meams you will need two characters: a lvl 80 to do the events and a lvl 49 to open all bags/containers.
---
Thanks for the answer. Good to hear we're not completely dead yet. Should I keep Commander gear for my Chrono in this case, and keep playing kinda like I'm used to?
---
And it seems I don't understand mirage as I couldn't break 10k dps with the viper axe/torch and scepter/pistol build on the golem, performs poorly in open world too. There just doesn't seem to be enough condi damage to make the viper gear worth it? I'm really confused where all that huge condi damage should be coming from on the mirage.
---
I would prefere a delete all option without typing "250 of useless finisher because I have the permanent one"
---
I'm almost 2 stacks of legendary spikes in WvW. I don't know why I'm still hoarding them.  It's a fair chunk of gold in merchants value
---
Firstly, wholeheartedly agree. To help in the meantime: link the chat code, then copy paste into delete dialog. Now all you have to do is remove the "[" and "]"
---
Not ideal, but a bandaid fix for the time being
---
The value of mid tier basic materials is higher than high tier. Supply and demand
---
I do agree that this stuff can feel nebulous at times. I don't think this was one of those cases though. When a player repeated this task a few thousand times in an hour, they weren't thinking this was standard gameplay.
---
I think I land more with the developers in many instances like this. I know people in game QA, and I know these are massively complex systems upon systems with so many possible interactions it boggles the mind. You absolutely cannot reasonably catch everything, and if it's economic in nature, you cannot always fix the damage it does to your game. If I were setting up an MMO, I would absolutely have rules in place similar to ANets, if a bug DOES slip through and you repeatedly use it for personal gain, well there needs to be a rule to encourage reporting, not exploiting.

If we can have the ex-god of death as a mini then why not?

offtopic question:
---
whats the point of writing 2k19 instead of 2019?
---
Not so long ago I would have commented "The poor guy who needs to balance that in PvP"... But since Arena Net doesn't seem to give a flying F on that game mode anyways... Yeah, sure. Sounds great! Would like to play it.
---
Maybe it sounds ‘hip’?  Idk
---

---
Would also be funny if the clone also copies everything you say in Chat for further confusion. :D But for real now... I think I would get annoyed of having a mirror image of my character running next to me all the time.
---
Congrats. I wish I could find one myself.
---
Awesome! I'd love to see a pic of it out the box at some point if possible please?
---
Good reception absolutely makes good headlines! "After doubling revenues, Guild Wars 2 is getting a third expansion - and it's CANTHA" would be a top 10 post for the year. People also really love banhammer posts like "Guild Wars 2 banned 5000 cheaters last month and it's not stopping there." This genre is starved for really good news and it gets gobbled up when games actually provide it.
---
"Condi works completely differently in different game modes of the game"
---
How can you possibly believe this when you are playing the game?
---
Was he banned for Cheat Engine? Because they did reduce bans for that to one month if you submitted tickets. They never admitted it was a bad ban, though. If you were banned for anything other than Cheat Engine there was no reduction.
---
Haha! I beat you on the Geods :D   ^but ^lose ^in ^every ^other ^category
---
In the defense of Fractal pugs the Iboga was busted at that time and some of the Druids took traits and skills to try and buff their pet as much as possible and we tried to maximise the number of conditions on the boss :p
---
But then in retrospect, giving Alacrity was probably a DPS loss for the Ibogas because it made them use stuff that was not their AA (the most powerful attack) more often so that was not that good.
---
Yeah I think it was for running Cheat Engine while he didnt even have gw2 launched lol
---
Ahh ok.
---
That is indeed true. But still funny how fragile Pet Balance is...
---
I can't tell if you're trolling or not. Bosses don't have condi cleanse outside of changing phases, players in PvP have small amounts of condi cleanse unless they're built specifically to not get memed by an all condi team, and condi cleanse in wvw is exceptionally common with a fb and scrapper in every party.

What exactly would an article like that even entail? The method wasnt anything tricky, just persistent. They literally gave him access to an account that he said wasnt his and didnt ask for, after all. Anyway, the point is, people already dismiss gaming sites as non-journalistic entities looking to hop on the drama train. Whether that's true or not, it means that an article as vague as it would have to be would not bring about a change.
---
The reddit threads were closed to prevent that exact situation. If you think that's a bad call, then the moderators are just as culpable. I disagree with that, though.
---
ArenaNet already refused to listen when he linked a ticket that gave him access to accounts that weren't his. Even if he sourced the accounts more ethically, ArenaNet still wouldnt have listened. Theyve demonstrated that repeatedly.
---
In the end, the fault lies with ArenaNet for refusing to listen. Trying to find another way he could have done it in hindsight is pointless unless there was an obviously better way to do it (like if he didnt try to contact ArenaNet). There wasnt.

As much as I agree on their policy of not saying anything until it's ready being shit and not the correct reaction to underdelivering in the past - the correct reaction would have been to get their shit together and get stuff done instead - I just can't take anyone seriously that only has praise for Path of Fire, sorry.
---
In that case its more of a difference in perspective. I cant say youre wrong for thinking theres never an excuse to hack a company. You can think hes in the wrong because you disagree with his methods, but calling him childish or a bad person for it is just narrow minded.

The only thing that's "challenging" on weaver is finishing your auto attack chain without interrupting it...just like most other DPS rotations; if you're trying to be optimal.
---
&gt; This can easily be addressed through the development of muscle memory and practice, unless you're handicapped in some manner (unfortunate if you are)
---
Oh yeah, I always forget about that site.
---
that's totally reasonable. Season 2 is the weakest.

yeah, but you would have stopped playing years ago, right?

The bots regularly get stuck and glitch out an entire game yet still get high gold to low plat at times.
---
Not sure if that says more about the bots or the playerbase.
---
Oooo I like that. What gear set is that?
---
Culture difference is noticable in pvp and wvw too. NA is more casual all around and heavily opposed to organisation in pugs. As a result they simply dont have any pugs for harder / group content.
---
EU chances on a decent group are higher on Monday and Tuesday mornings, lower on weekends. Afaik groups are also in decline.

Game so alive it can still lag for an hour straight!!!!!!!
---
While you are correct about toxic pvp being the norm in all games, a game with an endgame specifically about collecting skins (fashion wars), having ALL the mount (and most glider) skins in the gemstore is a very valid criticism point.
---
True. Game still dead tho.

I enjoyed reading this post. It's written nicely and reflects my feelings about Anet.
---
 Hey!  
---
First of all, thanks for the long and thorough response - I can see you've done your research and know much about the history of the company. I admire your attitude and would just like to present a little different point of view - for your consideration.  
---
&gt;this was abused by people who gained those keys through illegitimate and even criminal activities by getting credit card information, buying those keys, selling them on those key-resellers platforms like G2A for a much lower price to turn it into profit before the key is being banned because of CC chargebacks. 
---
This is an overarching myth that's dragging behind the company for a very long time, but tell me just one thing: how can you buy a game key online using a credit card? From my own experience, no big game dev does thins - you buy games directly on their platforms and they are automatically added to your account. You can't buy a key on Steam, you can't buy a key on Origin, or on Epic Games Store. Smaller stores usually also don't offer game keys - the exception being Humble Bundle, which has a very solid anti-fraud protection (trust me, if they had issues with credit card fraud, their payment provider would stop supporting them long ago). Bulk purchases of keys by wholesalers aren't paid by cc - these require signed agreements and payment transfers.  
---
&gt;G2A tried to go against this by introducing the G2A shield, Platform for developers to check against banned keys and other mechanics but with little success. 
---
I think you're conflating two things here: G2A Shield and the key-blocking tool. The former was a paid membership program, and yes, it wasn't a good idea - so it got scrapped altogether. The latter was a solution offered to the developers to facilitate reports of keys that are not meant for resale - this idea got scrapped because only a third of the number of developers we asked to sign up did so. Still, this doesn't mean we won't listen to such reports by devs - only that it will have to be done manually.  
---
&gt; 2017 when their AMA got a lot of attention 
---
This is a very specific case and explaining it whole would require a separate post, so to not make this wall of text even bigger: the seller who started all this was not completely honest with the audience from the start, as they underwent a detailed verification, which allowed them to do so - normal sellers "from the street" didn't have such ability back then, all keys were immediately, automatically blocked after being set up and a request of a proof of purchase was sent.  
---
&gt;While I agree those are pretty old instances their latest controversy is from earlier this year in which indie devs are saying that you rather should torrent the game instead of buying it from G2A. 
---
This is a very interesting case, because in [our response](https://www.g2a.com/news/latest/g2a-vows-to-pay-devs-10x-the-money-proven-to-be-lost-on-chargebacks/) we asked the devs to give us proof of any misconduct with the keys that happened on the marketplace. Only two replied, and [one of them](https://kotaku.com/developer-fumes-about-keyseller-g2a-but-admits-he-was-1837252091) turned out to actually try to tie their problem to us, while we didn't exist as a marketplace when it happened.  
---
&gt; you should ask yourself how such a low price can be reached in the first place. 
---
A multitude of ways, actually: buying keys in bulk as a wholesaler, buying from a cheaper region (which is totally fine and legal - this is how trade worked for thousands of years), selling a surplus of keys got in a bundle are just a few.   
---
&gt;If you want to save money then look through the official retailers like DLGamer who have a lower price 
---
Just a thought: what if someone - a wholesaler, for instance - strikes a deal with an official retailer for a few thousand keys at a discount and then resells these keys on marketplaces? Are all keys sold that way illegitimate? They came from an official source, after all, and the developers got their share already.  
---
Lastly, to end this incredibly long dissertation, here are some numbers: on G2A there are roughly 1 000 000 keys sold each month. We have over 20 000 000 clients, most of which are returning buyers. Our biggest sellers report only a 1-5% of dissatisfied customers, and these bad reviews are for a multitude of reasons, problems with banned key being only a minuscule fraction. If the issue you describe here was in any way as common as it's thought to be, these numbers would be much different. Once again, thanks for the thorough comment - it's always nice to see someone who thinks critically and posts rational arguments online :)

As someone that falls into the latter category, I find thief easier and that it has a much lower APM in instanced PvE. I'm not spamming buttons as power Deadeye (either variant) or Daredevil and instead timing and positioning is much more important.

Unless you want to include spamming auto attacks as contributing to APM difficulty.

---
Regarding 4), how realistic is "find a zerg to follow" on a random server and time in 2019? Seems unlikely.
---
I fully agree they should L2P. Also, warclaw shouldn't be a way to avoid combat. 
---
But it's true that the difference between skilled players and average ones is absurdly large. 
---
Playing wvw against veterans is like doing dhuum cm before doing any fractals or raids at all. Some people will manage but for most it's so far above their skill level that it wont help them learn nor help them enjoy the process.
---
The truth is skilled wvw players should NOT be playing with newbs non stop. They should be fighting among eachother in their own tier. And new players should be fighting others of their own level in another tier. 
---
You know, like every modern competitive game. Putting players together regardless of skill was the norm 20 years ago, but was already outdated 10 years ago.
---
 
---
Unfortunately certain players are heavily opposed to this idea because they have the /right/ to play with whoever they see fit. Because they dont want to play at their own level, nor improve or l2p at all. They want to get carried to easy rewards.
---
Most veterans I know liked it, the only people that didn't seem to like it were the hyper mobile classes (thieves)
---
Yeah, mobile games.
---
there is a quote from article author's comment:
---
"I’d like to be able to nail this down, but the original wording is confusing. To the court, ArenaNet claimed Wasabi’s account was worth $750K on the black market and that the damage done to Gray’s account was even more than that (I take this to mean the embarrassment, not just the hats and armor), so they were in effect compounding to at minimum $1.5M in calculated damages."
---
Me neither, they can do rollbacks and recover character data so it doesn't add up.
---
Okay, I have read it and had no idea that someone else was reporting issues to Anet. 
---
Let me be clear. Everything is written there is truth. I mean talking about Anet security.
---
I will write my story as soon as I will get home.
---
You would be amazed how easy is to take control of your account at NcSoft platform.
---
* **No one:** ...
---
* **Blizzard:** Let's suicide 1 month before BlizzCon!
---
* **ArenaNet:** WE CAN SUICIDE TOO, LOOK AT US!
---
*Slow clap*
---
Most veterans I know didnt. And they're mostly guild / group players that proudly kick thieves and rangers from their groups... not exactly the mobile classes.
---
It’s happened to me. They should make it a bouncy chest
---
This. It's really weird that guardians still get this when other classes like Daredevil don't get the extra dodges

&gt;  how can you buy a game key online using a credit card?
---
I'm not that well informed on how criminals get those type of keys but I ran into some issues with keys for Software bought from a key reseller (not you) myself in which my key suddenly was not accepted anymore since someone else already was using it. 
---
Also [this AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/arl5bz/i_am_an_exg2a_scammer/) isn't that old with only 7 months ago so it is quite fresh.
---
However, those keys come from somewhere, I don't know where but they do and for the end user there is no way to distinguish between a legit key or not.
---
And I bet you yourself will not be able to prevent that one key gets sold on multiple websites either.
---
The thing is, you have already this bad reputation and you probably will not be able to get rid of it.
---
However, the developers of this game have a very strict policy on stolen or not-legit keys and will ban your whole account instead of just access to certain parts of the game. And since no one can distinguish between a legit key and one that isn't, the recommendation for this game is to not buy from you or any other not authorized reseller.
---
It is just to protect ourself and not risk our accounts in the process because we can't know if we buy a key or pig in the poke.

I've got a funny story about that!

It was super neat!

Illusionist wouldn't be a bad name, however, for the german localization they already translated 'Mirage' with 'Illusionist'. It's not that they can't change it, but I always wondered why they choose a name for a translation that could sooner or later become an elite on it's own.

Used Gorilla Glue Epoxy and now it feels just as strong as it was before breaking.

Kitless holo is different from normal holo for only one skill. Instead of taking grenade kit, take photon wall.
---
Then play same rotation as normal (don't let overheat). Use photon wall toolbelt skill same time with surprise shot. They have same cooldown.
---
Damage is similar, slightly less, does not matter in real encounters. Fun, has damage and CC. If I play engineer in raids, I always choose kitless holo.
---
Gorilla Glue Epoxy, mine is as good as new.

But that is still not entirely true. There are very high ranked players out there who are not skilled, just played a lot. The problem that OP has is they are getting ganked by gankers, not your average veteran players.

It's not all or nothing. If you have constant communication you can manage and adjust expectations subtly over time, rather than having to knee-jerk react when you drop a bombshell or let your community whip themselves into a Redditrage while you sit back with your fingers in your ears.

If he literally couldn't think of another way to convince ArenaNet, I would honestly prefer he still be trying up to this day with the other methods he has been trying with rather than to do what he did, which is something I would never do no matter what. Maybe you would think it's wrong for someone not to do what he did, I wouldn't think that way.

Right now you just have people run around on soulbeast 2 and 2, oneshoting people with next to no counterplay.

So getting dismounted is just 100% you die.

Not delays. But when they talk about a feature, and then they decide it isn't gonna work, and the community gets angry as if they broke a promise.

If you have a mentor tag or even better, a Commander tag, many people just can't resist the draw of following it. Turn that big neon sign on too!

OMG I remember that! I was the druid that died at the end of Deimos like a prick (patlick). Do you remember how we desperatly tried to do Deimos with just 9 druid and that all kinds of weird handkiting techniques. The other bosses were so easy tho! Still a shame that we had to take an actual handkiter in the end.
---
At least you made me laugh :D
---
I am talking about the incident itself and Jessica’s firing was clearly gender oppression and abuse of power. It is very disgusting that you keep pretending she is not a victim in the entire case. Do I really need to point out that you are exactly the same type of people as those who defend male rapists and murderers? 
---
You label the oppressed group as evils and turn the entire world against them. Aren’t you trying a little bit too hard in assisting the witch hunting? Wish to look like a good girl to men so they won’t do the same horrible things to you? Well, that explains it. 
---
Just because the level of oppression is “ignorable” to you does not mean other women must also shut up on it. I mean, you can enjoy being beaten and abused by men every single day. But that is YOUR problem. By your standard, you can also just say that HK protestors were complaining for nothing since there was no oppression done to them in YOUR EYES. They deserved to lose their jobs or even lives because they were the ones being offensive to innocent policemen. 
---
Obviously there is something you will never understand. Other women do not deserve to lose their lives and jobs just because they disagree with you and your male lords. 
---
A mentally messed up person has no place to tell what other people should do. Tell the male haters to stop being pieces of shit to women, not questioning oppressed women why they can’t “just live normal lives”.

is there an list of ascended gear like rings and accessoires you should keep? I have like a million rings and beside zerker im not sure which one i should keep or salvage.
---
So cuteeee! &lt;3
---
I'm going to disagree pretty heavily with this. APM just isn't that important as a Thief in PvE - it's timing and positioning that counts for more due to how we improve our damage with flanking and sensitivity to both Assassin's Signet and Revealed timing.
---
You can have amazing APM and still not get those aspects down and you'll end up doing pretty average DPS. Have bad APM and it was still possible to hit benchmark numbers and easily get 100th percentile parses on GW2raidar when it was a thing. I know this because I could do both despite damaged nerves reducing my APM and moving most of my actions to my thumb and a mouse numberpad. 
---
Staff DD hasn't had any sort of APM requirements for as long as I can remember. It's certainly been made more easy in terms of timing as you no longer have as much important on interrupting your auto chain at the right time but the number of buttons being pressed and the speed they need to be executed remains pretty mundane.
---
Not really sure where this fixation with APM has even really come from. This isn't Starcraft.
---
I'd be happy with delete all.
---
r/GW2Exchange is probably where you want to go for that
---
Thank you \^\^
---
In regards to rings and accessories: if it's stat swappable, berserker, or you need the stat combo right now then keep it, otherwise feel free to salvage it. 
---
Ascended trinkets are so easy to get now that you can easily stock up on 2-3 sets of spare, unset trinkets and that will be all you need for a long time.
---
the ones in vabbi are all on surface so you cant lure t hem to a cave to check. they might be. or might not
---
I gotta check the borderland ones during the day. It may just be an alternate skin just for them.
---

---
Holy shit can you spare a dye bro? I'm new and a fashion whore, if you don't like pink/purple or anything usually girly please dump them on me D:
---
Are you having fun?
---
Are you successfully completing your intended roll?
---
If the answer to these two things are yes then thats all the validation you need.
---
As for keeping alive, well use the heal skill that heals you for an amount based on the damage you do, and get a few good utility skills that heal / reduce damage. I also like the signet healing skill.
---
What i use on my guardian atm (at least until i get fire brand
---
The heal skill i mentioned (i forget its name, its the 25 second cool down one that converts damage to healing ) spirit bow, hammer and sword, and elite signet. Bow + hammer can proc a light blast finisher, and sword i mainly have because its cool, but it also deals good damage.
---
I also recommend keeping a staff in your offhand slot, for the heals and buff,  or a scepter for a ranged attack + whatever offhand you prefer.  Tho staff is probably better.

They did exactly that for the latest balance patch on the official forums, posting multiple threads over the course of a month and asking specific questions about what the community thought. Some changes were cancelled, others altered, but most remained (as it should be honestly).

---
Yeap thats the healing skill im currently running here!
---
I was considering weapon swapping with a focus since it has a nice mitigation skill
---
Like I always say, alive DPS is greater than dead DPS.
---
Not really, it just caters to the least fun experiences you can have in WvW: getting spawn camped by 1+ enemies, and being forced to 1vX. Neither of these things should be strictly forced on anyone. The Warclaw was a nice (but not 100% perfect) way to opt out of that and only play proper WvW, but now they just let no-life trolls jizz their pants by harassing players they know for sure can't fight back due to the differences in build purpose. It's just dumb, and only makes WvW less appealing to play.
---
Delta mentioned you when I asked if he had any plans for exporting the builds to a readable format!
---
Are you going to be working on a read and write or just the read? i.e. for saving text-only templates after the update
---
For the “millions of dollars of damage” they were claiming, probably would have been a lot of expenses, especially given the international jurisdiction.
---
Stop being a piece
---
Remember you have two weapon sets..yea for sure.  But remember that you also need to watch out for heavy attacks and red ground circles from bosses, dodging is essential. I dont remember when you get elite skills,  but the elite signet will help with passive healing,  + plus an emergency oh sht full heal.
---
&gt; Abandon the strategy of Silence. Speak to your playerbase. Communicate with your playerbase.  
---
That would rely on a PR and marketing department not constantly stumbling over their own feet. 
---
Because when they trip, someone goes:  
---
&gt; AAAAAAAAH!
---
nope
---
&gt; I’d like to be able to nail this down, but the original wording is confusing. To the court, ArenaNet claimed Wasabi’s account was worth $750K on the black market and that the damage done to Gray’s account was even more than that (I take this to mean the embarrassment, not just the hats and armor), so they were in effect compounding to at minimum $1.5M in calculated damages.
---
&gt; Even as someone who’s sold MMO accounts long ago when that was still a common and legal practice, I’m speechless at the idea that any MMO account is worth $750K, but especially a Guild Wars 1 account in 2016. I can only imagine the court found the whole thing even more incredible.
---
From Royce in the comments
---
Duh, writing on the wall shows Mo left cuz ncsoft took over leadership, hence he does not have power in the studio anymore to create gw3  mobile. Basically your new president is that Cape dress guy from ncsoft who came out to show gw2 merch during the big announcement. As far as devs goes, ncsoft got alot, you may not like it tho.
---
Reminds me of a few quotes/paraphrases from the old forums: 
---
&gt; “I’m finding companies should sell access to forums,
---
it seems many like them better than the games they comment on.”
---
&gt; There has to be profit in providing therapy for people who no longer play games but can't be bothered to leave.
---
but but archeage has more content for casual gamers than gw2... hence all the vocations and non combat related activities which farming is only one of those. Archeage pleases both the hardcore and casuals more than GW2 whi i find comical since gw2 brands itself as being a casual friendly mmo
---
Yeah, tbh if this is your first char and you are trying to solo bosses (I'm assuming these are champion mobs) you'd be significantly better off once you have all 3 specializations, since they give insane synergies.
---
Oooo she looks so great! I love your armor choices and her overall color scheme.
---
&gt; If i commit to a focus as a offhand there is any option for ranged attacks on main hand
---
Scepter is really your only option
---
What I mean is, that Laser Disk, Photon Wall, the according toolbelt skills and Sword 1-3 are not very useful below the heat threshold of 50.
---
If you overheat, you need to cool down to 0.
---
So, running the blasting module, you overheat with a blast, and need to push out laser disk, photon wall, sword skills and the according holo toolbelt skills before you cooled down to 50%, because under 50% heat these skills all loose about 30% of their strength.
---
Then you got to cool down from 50% to 0%, where the above skills are all loose their heat buff. The sword auto attack chain is quite strong anyway against a single target, but you should bring something besides that, like granade kit + granade barage.
---
At that point I usually go back into Forge, to heat up again and don't get into that 50%-0% cooldown phase, but you can't do that if you overheated.
---
So no-kit + blasting module  doesn't make sense to me as a concept, because you want some kit for the 50%-0% cooldown.
---
It's either overheating and bringing a kit for the second half of cooldown or don't overheat and try to get back into forge just below 50% heat for maximum use of the benefits from heat.
---
In reality it doesn't matter that much, because even on an inefficient build 30k dps on holo is no problem.
---
But just thinking about the logic behind the build and why it wouldn't work anymore, because overheating got a bigger penalty is hard for me to understand.
---
that some quality purrkour
---
It was a good read and well written. 
---
My advice to add on to OP's to ANet would be: look at how Bungie handles communicating to their playerbase with Destiny 2. They have multiple community managers who talk to us on the d2 subreddit, and sometimes not even about the game. Like they come in and just talk to us sometimes. They mention things like passing on information and suggestions between the community and the developers, they mention known bugs that are being worked on, or just hopping in for a witty response or joke. On top of that, they post a TWAB (This Week at Bungie) every single Thursday. And, for anyone unaware, Luke Smith (the lead director for the franchise) posted a MASSIVE behind-the-scenes write-up a month or two ago about past failings, thoughts, and what direction they want to go and what they want to do for the future of the game. 
---
TL;DR: Use Bungie and Destiny 2 as a prime example of how to communicate to your community.
---
yo get everything if you repeat it except one bouncy chest that is only once per day per account.

I kind of want a Greek or Roman themed Warrior elite spec.  With the special mechanic of being able to wield 2 handed weapons in one hand.  I'm not a game designer, so I don't know how to decide which skills would change when you go from 2 hand to 1 hand, but I think it would be interesting.

Wielding a longbow with 1 hand may not really work out though...

Probably not because:

A. People love to talk about boycotting something but not actually doing it.
---
B. WoW is much more similar to FFXIV than it is to GW2
---
It does seem that way.  But that’s life unfortunately. I’m sure you’ll win something you didn’t expect to at some point.

For 99% of people nothing a company says would make them quit or boycott a game. People just want to play, nothing more, nothing less. Especially if they've already invested many years.
---
ANet could declare their war on women and black people tomorrow and I would not stop playing GW2 because the game doesn't change for me, no matter what the company says. Those are the company's views, not mine. I don't play the game because I share their views, I play the game because I enjoy playing it.
---
Silence is honestly what gives off the horrible feeling that the game is dying or has no future more than anything else.  Maybe this type of communication worked 4-5 years ago, but it's no longer the expectation from a community towards its devs.
---
Warframe, Destiny 2, Path of Exile, FFIV, shoot even SW:Battlefront 2 has been doing amazing lately by realizing that times have changed and communities expect better, more transparent, and more frequent updates from the games they love and the direction it's headed.  
---
It's a shame to see GW2, which originally pioneered amazing innovative ideas ahead of its time for the entire MMO genre, now fall soooo far behind the times on what is expected from online video game community interaction standards.

For those people I have been ecouraging them to look into pirating blizzards stuff and using unofficial servers.

No one is meaningfully contributing to their server, because as a meaningful competition WvW is a complete joke.

nope, it's the one that lets you choose an item from an small pool. Every HoT and PoF maps have one of these. People ussually get amalgamated gemstone due to the price.
---
Lmao you're so incredibly angry at a select group of people. This entire comment is an enormous rage filled generalization. Just like how I could say how zergers have no interest in anything related to PvP.
---
Like i could simply say Zergers want xp/karma/loot. Zergers have no realm loyalty and don't care whatsoever over having a proper zerg build you're thinking of gvg players. For some all this is true, for some half, for some none. That's the nature of generalizing large groups of people into idiotic stereotypes. 
---
 It's not a roamers fault that a zerger can't use the plethora of tools imaginable to escape i.e mount, gliding, stealth, mobility, and the environment. If you're stupid enough to beeline directly to your tag without utilizing any of the impossible number of combinations of options you have at your disposal to avoid a fight then you deserve to die. It's not a no life killing you, it's just someone better at utilizing their skills and mechanics to win. Something you don't learn much riding a wave of 30 other people that can make up for you personal short comings. In the end your pussified playstyle is no worse than a roamer wanting to gank bad players (you).
---
Way to long for a read, not that interested :P

[Here is one druid killing Cairn](https://youtu.be/VWDvHazI8G4)... I've also seen 3 player Mat, heavy healer comp ignoring slubs and poison in the center on sloth, 2 man VG, 5 man Xera, etc. The DPS checks are not as hard as you think they are and there are builds like condi druid that can pull decent DPS when you have 7 druids running it, allowing for 2 other professions also means you can cover basically all boons which is important.

Are you Eu or Na. If you are an servers I can help you this weekend
---
Nope, sorry not really interested in role play or story characters.
---
Instead, GW will HAVE to be behind a monthly subscription.  Which I don't feel like paying for.  They will lose customers with a monthly sub.  Having skins in a gem store is totally acceptable.  As long as you aren't given an advantage with it.   And in Guild Wars, there isn't really an advantage to get anyways.  Unless you're playing PVP and then that has it's own system in place anyways for leveling up as it were.   Boost away in what is mostly a single player game anyways, and fully co-op otherwise.
---
care to give a bit more detail?
---
it was regarding... ahem... a certain decision on taimis biology... we'll say.

Professions do not have "a role" and should never be pigeonholed into "a role". The entire premise of GW2 is that there is no trinity.

&gt; I am really looking for a casual MMO that I can play around with  
---
Gw2 definitely fits this. 
---
&gt;  I was wondering, how populated is the game still?  
---
populated enough to quickly find groups for most things you'd want one for most times of the day. very populated in the evenings/on the weekends  
---
&gt; How much money do I need to put in the game to get the full game?      
---
29.99 
---
&gt;Are there any newbie friendly guilds out there?  
---
most definitely. the entire community is usually very friendly to new players and there are always guilds posting recruitment messages in the low level maps willing to help out. you'll only occasionally run into some people who expect to you know what you're doing and flame you if you don't but usually in my experience they just didn't realize you were new and would be willing to help you if you told them.    
---
Give the game a shot I think there's a lot to enjoy here. Some veterans are bitter and frustrated with the amount of new content it is getting but if you're just starting it won't affect you. A few of my friends started playing recently and I'm having a blast rediscovering the game with them
---
Okay, I didnt think it needed clarification but obviously this would give it the CAPABILITY to be a support class, not pigeonhole it into only ever being support. Im not saying replace its current role entirely (although its current role seems to omit any decent use in pve, bar ooen world)
---
The game is very populated and there is always someone ready to help. **Guild Wars 2** is free and you can buy the second expansion **Path of Fire** for $30 which gives the first expansion **Heart of Thorns** for free. On top of that, there are three "Living World Seasons" that must cost about $50 total to obtain. I don't know about newbie guilds but they surely exist.
---
Game is fine, I never had any trouble finding party or just random people for help during events. It's just weird that people don't stream it on twitch etc. that's why it looks like it's dead, but it's not. I played BDO recently (im lvl 29 and I barely saw any people outside town). Btw if You will play on EU server pm me your char name.

This reminds me of that Pokemon episode where Meowth goes to Hollywood and challenges a pack of Meowth and Persian... lol
---
The movement in GW is soo good that I can't play other mmos anymore, feels really bad, like running as piece of wood.

It already is viable. Basically everything is viable in PvE. Scrapper has crazy heals and tons of protection. Those are two very valid reasons to play it.
---
Double mace engi

Don't forget to give scrapper an evasion frame when gyros are destroyed.
---
Gwen was my favorite original character. Chibi Gwen even better. When you first meet her mom in UW... the feels. And then the revelation in EoTn was just like "f\*ck yes!". Easily one of the best developed characters in the series.
---
Evennia is my other favorite. But Anet gives no shits for Evennia. Everyone else gets minis, or ghosts, or skills, and tons of cameos and lore. Evennia gets an enemy occupied tower prop just sort of mentioned in passing.  We didn't even get a name drop during the reenactment of Markis's betrayal; and she was the only reason the Shining Blade even continued to exist after that.

Although I recommend against Amalgamated Gemstones on Dragon Stand. The Pact Commando Crate is a much better deal, since it comes with 12 Machetes. If you need gemstones, just grab them on the other metas, buy, or craft them (they’re pretty cheap at the moment).

---
DLGamer is an authorized keyseller for GW2.

Mine broke as well. Then i lost it in the move 😭
---
I get the impression that if we had a roadmap, it would just look like the next couple of episodes of the Icebrood Saga, maybe a fractal or a half-completed raid wing, and then just vague storylines. I really do think that the rebranding of Living World into a Saga is just their way of admitting they have no idea what they're going to produce looking forward, and are winging it based on what works and what doesn't.
---
They wont communicate with us, because they have no road map.
---
90% of those players are just going to keep right on playing and forget about the whole thing in a month.

Preach.

What's this have to do with the post?
---
&gt; *I’m pretty content* but my best friend (who also plays) thinks I made a poor choice. Thoughts? 
---
Asked and answered. If you are happy and it adds to your enjoyment of your character and the game then it's not a bad choice. To each their own.
---
Is druid good in raiding? Does anyone have a build?
---
That was the case in GW1, that game had a *lot* of rubber banding on weak connections. I'm pretty sure that's not the case with GW2. I don't think I've ever seen rubber-banding in GW2 even though I've seen plenty of other connection issues (skills not firing, fake dodges that don't cost endurance because the client just plays the animation, players running into walls because my client hasn't gotten their updated movement). You can do complex jumping puzzles in GW2 on a horrible connection (good luck doing that with rubber banding) and I think one of the reasons for why there's no body blocking is because movement is client-side so that wouldn't work very well anyway.
---
I'm pretty sure that when the devs switched gliding from the server to the client (because people in Australia just died to fall damage before their glider had a chance to deploy), they commented on how they had to do some parts different from normal movement because faking gliding would somehow be worse than faking regular ground movement.
---
&gt; If it were the other way around, you'd probably see lots of movement hacks being used in the game, especially in competitive modes. 
---
Isn't that a thing? I've never seen it in person but I've read lots of movement hack complaints on reddit. I can think of two particularly notable ones in WvW: in one case people were "under" the map. They weren't visible because the floor was blocking line of sight, they couldn't be targeted for attacks, and they were attacking regular players with glass cannon thief builds. In another case, *waaay* back in the day when WvW still had those orbs that gave bonuses or something, players movement hacked into keeps to steal those orbs and then flew away with their movement hacks. I think that's actually the reason those orbs were removed.
---
For a casual player it is fine, its issues are for the more hardcore things like raiding / PvP / WvW (mass scale PvP).
---
not sure, we're not support.
---
Welcome back, and hope you enjoy your stay! I've taken many breaks from this game over the years, but it's one I always have a blast coming back to.
---
Thing is those pods need a machete to open and it is not that easy to get that many. I mean it is not hard if you play it but it is not like in verdant brink were you kill a ambient creature and get 500 crowbars. 
---
So were the thought is nice the farm wont be that great as you belive because you will fast run out of machetas and buying them cost a bit of currency you need for other things as well.
---
why should this even be a thing to consider?!
---
Spoken like a true CCP supporter!
