Yup, sorry I didn't see this sooner to reply. It's not even very hard to make. This isn't the final form, either, but I like it better for the lightsaber look. (Finished the ascended version then reskinned back to the previous, ha.)

They punched up a basic hairstyle, I think I know which one that's supposed to be, and it's

A: one of the few available to both genders of a race (or at least there's a nearly identical hairstyle on female sylvari)

And B: so much cooler looking in this piece that I'd be wouldn't complain if a new variant was created off this alone even if it was locked behind the makeover/hairstyle kit.

Getting burned out on PvP has made me into a super casual log in every month type of player. It’s hard to stay motivated when you can’t have inherent communication with your teammates, call out plays and help each other. I play other games now to scratch my competitive itch and just fractal with my guild it’s on occasion.
---
And there has to be intuitiveness to combat so people do not need to know the intricacies and peculiarities of every single skill to know whether they'll go through a 6 meter thick wall. 
---
I'm not saying nothing should go through walls, but one thing is a shout like "Chilled to the Bone!" or a mesmer ethereal field going through a gate, and another is a melee attack or a long cleave like blunderbuss of Flame Jet that no one would - nor should - expect going through a wall.
---
They usually unban accounts for this i wouldn't worry too much, ANET can hardly blame customers for shopping around for a better deal.

[The purple mask](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glowing_Purple_Mask) says it was limited time only and for signing up before the 29th. Doesn't look like you can get it unless the offer it again in the future. You might as well contact support if he was having issues with the newsletter signup staying on, worst case is they take a while to respond and say no.
---
I can’t tell if the joke is the karka killing or the idea that dragonite is rare and precious
---
That was pretty clutch, I'm not gonna lie.
---
Really depends on how you feel, I always suggest leveling a character first (you go through the full story, get a better feel for the game and areas, and don't feel as lost). If you're confident feel free to gear and play on the 80s but if not just keep leveling. I am also working on a [guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Leveling) if you want some general help or of course ask questions here if you're feeling lost.
---
Oh please don’t change the Deepstone fractal. I love using Unrelenting Assault to chase that boss.
---
I would have to say so, But it will be pretty cool
---
Thanks for the link and the info!
---
So I should get a vipers set just to be safe?
---
No not useless. Skyscale can't climb if there's a Slippery Slope
---
Go to every HoT, PoF, and Living Story map you can and farm mussels. Do it on every character and make sure you get a guild gathering boost first
---
That is not really an underwater fractal issue so much as a general issue everywhere. Use of movement/shadowstep abilities will increase the chance of running into.

Why did you make a new post about it? ArenaNet just wants you to contact support. Posting an apology here here is no big deal.
---
Thank you for heads up, didn't know those also reset. SR feels even more wicked now.
---
So I'll assume this is for WvW and that you already have ascended so you don't want cheap exotic/ascended alternatives like [Druid's staff](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Druid%27s_Staff)/[Yggdrasil](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Yggdrasil) or [chronomancer's shield](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chronomancer%27s_Shield)/[Horologicus](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Horologicus)/[Caladbolg Astera](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Caladbolg_Astera) or even the [fractal](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/BLING-9009#Ascended_Weapons)/[PvP](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_Weapon_League_Vendor)/[WvW](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skirmish_Supervisor)/[raid](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Basic_Magnetite_Exchange_Operative#Ascended_Weapons) options like [cobalt staff](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/BLING-9009#Ascended_Weapons). I'll also assume you have done the ["Is a good Offense" achievement](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heart_of_Thorns:_Act_1#achievement2287) for the inscription and a [chest of inscriptions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chest_of_Inscriptions) from raids is out of the question.
---
Well the farming options aren't great for [pearls](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Freshwater_Pearl), lots of limited daily farms on mussels and chests that all have low drops. Unless you're fine hoping for rng for a long time your best bet is to just buy them so you're better off focusing on [high value farming](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Gold_Farming) methods like silverwastes, Istan, or HoT metas.
---
&gt; Was your best friend
---
Mate I would give her the benefit of the doubt of not knowing better and being misinformed just the same way as you were.
---
I saw your other post, if only either of you did a quick Google search you would have known G2A mostly has low price because games and stuff there are often purchased from stolen credit cards.
---
In fact there was a post on this very subreddit just 1 or 2 weeks back warning everyone that we should not buy anything from G2A since we are getting an influx of new players.
---
I would suggest you talk to support, explain your situation with as much detail as you can, apologize, and never do it again. Hope it works for you and you get your account back.
---
I used to run into this a lot but it was fixed for me quite a while ago.
---
I know people are reporting this but I am going to leave it up. We can never have enough warnings for people to never buy things from G2A.
---
I mean, you *could* do Power Firebrand, but there wouldn't be any reason to outside of niche Quickness builds and self-sustain.
---
DH is the power Guardian spec and FB is the condi/support Guardian spec.
---
Best you can do is contact support and explain the situation. If you are lucky they will restore access to the accounts. Nothing we can do here for it.
---
Dry Top, Silverwastes, and any core Orr map. They're much larger and denser than Bloodstone Fen but don't have hearts to slow you down. After that, other Living Story maps, which are generally smaller and have less hearts than core maps.
---
Southsun Cove seems great, but is in fact so great they disabled key drops for it entirely.
---

I think it's just because the gate doesn't count as a wall. Ever stood in melee range of a gate in WvW with a zerg hammering on it? x_x 
---
"Walls" don't really count as walls either, but they're thick enough to avoid things like a Blunderbuss.
---
Might also be due to blocked ports client uses to download data. You can try 443 or 80 instead and that may fix it. Add -clientport 80 or -clientport 443 to a shortcut (properties destination) and confirm if its resolved. More info as how to below:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments
---
Stuff like that makes it seem less like the encounter was fine-tuned to be fun, but challenging and with a good bit of counter-play, and more "throw all the adds you can at them, don't care that their skills become much more horrific when there's a bunch of them at once."
---
[removed]
---
Ultimately it's up to you; I personally don't wait until I have the gold because I like seeing progress. If I was hardcore and needed it ASAP, I'd wait until I had all the gold first (then you can invest the gold into other resources in the meantime)
---
And yet none of these legendaries had anything to do with the story. 
---
They are related to the map and maybe some NPCs, but not to the story. 
---
But in your opening post you talk about how the new greatsword could reveal things about the futur story, LS5.
---
Why do your characters use the broad end of the sword? Major DPS loss
---
&gt;Druid is not that good in fractals, IMO, there are supports that either heal (druid can't really heal) or bring similar utility while doing a lot more damage. But it's a pretty good class in fractals 
---
This is all over the place. Druid is still great if you have a chrono in your group. It's not as great if you have a quickbrand or alacrigade and one of them is capable of healing. But the same applies to Alacrigade if you don't have a Quickbrand, or vice-versa. 
---
Druid and chrono may no longer be considered optimal as compared to a quickbrand/alacrigade comp, but it's still easily capable of carrying groups in CMs and beyond.
---
Druid CAN heal, and heals very well. It may not have the constant sustain of a heal tempest or alacrigade, but it is more bursty and better at recovering from spikes of damage. In a pug setting, where spikes are expected, I would argue that Druid is objectively the better healer.
---
No other healer can provide spirits. Spirits have been nerfed heavily, but they are still unique buffs that only a Soulbeast (or Ranger) can provide.
---
No healer does "a lot more damage" in fractals.
---
Legends says he still there, *posing*
---
most of his audience probably wouldn't enjoy gw2 in the first place. he doesn't actually care when people talk shit about him (many in the WoW community already do the same as you guys) but he just laughs at them and the fact they took time out of their day to badmouth someone they don't know on reddit / wow forums
---
There used to be at least several hand drawn comics here on this reddit about the commanders shenanigans. What they lacked in "art quality" they made up with either funny quotes/faces or by being suprisingly deep and hard hitting. Does anyone know what I am talking about and has a link or something for me?
---
2-3 unid for tarir/gerent? Seriously?
---
I ran the events between 5 and 20 times depending on length and tracked the drops in the gw2efficiency farming tracker. You got a LOT of unids. Like, issues with invisible bag space after a few hours of cycling lots. 
---
9g is without the gemstone. You get enough currency at maxed participation to buy enough keys to open almost every chest in tarir and about 3 lanes of chests plus the final room for TD. Both events gave pretty reliable values.
---
Personally I map complete the 5 starter zones since everything is so low level it's quick and easy to kill, and since I've made such a habit of this I know my routes by heart. Not saying they're objectively the quickest to finish, but they're what I've gone for.
---
Dry Top has always been quick for me to complete (with mounts - the springer makes all the difference for it) but I've already done it on every character to farm geodes. I also do Malchor's Leap on most characters since I've spent a lot of time there farming elder wood and know my way around it a bit too well for my own good, and the complete lack of hearts is nice. 
---
Basically, if there's any maps you know really well and spend a lot of time in anyways, they might be better to do on alts since you already know how to get to most poi and vistas probably. Otherwise, the other answer pretty much covers it.
---
trolls don't make the kind of money that streamers make. it would be pointless if he was just doing it for no reason but he makes more money than most just for playing videogames and watching videos all day. it's not really that different from acting like a prick for a movie / tv series, he just isn't a professional actor
---
At some point (2016/2017) anet said no more ever anymore legendaries....
---
(as much as this is asked, someone should sticky the anet dev post on this)
---
Happy to help, it's too bad there aren't more mace options (only 3 professions use it and 0 elite specs). Also if you need to make the mace it is cheaper (gold wise) to craft a [Maklain's Mace](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-71457) (59.5g + fulgurite) instead of stat [swapping a Grizzlemouth's](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-46956;1-72875) (60.75g + ~1g ecto + 10 spirit shards). So depending on if you have the [fulgurite](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fulgurite)/[Obsidian Shards](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Obsidian_Shard) or want to save a couple gold (really not that much in this case).
---
The more comments I get people saying different things just makes me more confused tbh
---
Don't use a mini.

Lmao for real... just switch it off if you're playing a mission.
---
I'm having the same issues as you. 
---

---
Any chance the GW2 expansions will go on sale soon?
---
Well, GW1 is more like the old school MMOs while GW2 is more like an action MMO. Also in GW1 all maps are instanced, which makes you team up way more important. (actually GW1 is an Competitive Online Roleplaying Game, a CORPG not an MMORPG) In GW2 on the other hand a map can be filled with up to ~150 players (depends on the map), but also you can run around solo. So it's between both extremes, solo and zerg. Team ups are only important for certain instances (fractals, raids). 
---
All in all you can see that both games are completely different and imo they are not comparable., because you would compare two different genres. (Like comparing an ego-shooter with a racing game, but way less extreme)
---
However, this doesn't change your opinion ofcourse. It just explain why (a little bit). :)

I agree. I prefer GW1 combat as well.
---
Plus, only 8 skills to manage...could remake for consoles. Won't happen but I can dream.
---
Best bet is to ask around in game or on /r/guildrecruitment. You could also try and find your old guild on sites like [guildex](https://gw2.guildex.org/guilds) or [gw2armory](https://gw2armory.com/).
---
Totally worth it. You'll see a lot if familiar places and people to.

I'm searching for a new goal to sink my time in.

Mainly people farm the[ two clumps of trees in straits and malchor](https://gw2efficiency.com/gathering/permanent-nodes?filter.materials.copper=false&amp;filter.materials.silver=false&amp;filter.materials.iron=false&amp;filter.materials.gold=false&amp;filter.materials.platinum=false&amp;filter.materials.mithril=false&amp;filter.materials.orichalcum=false&amp;filter.materials.potatoes=false&amp;filter.materials.lettuce=false&amp;filter.materials.strawberries=false&amp;filter.materials.spinach=false&amp;filter.materials.grapes=false&amp;filter.materials.cabbage=false&amp;filter.materials.pumpkins=false&amp;filter.materials.cauliflower=false&amp;filter.materials.butternut=false&amp;filter.materials.artichoke=false&amp;filter.materials.carrot=false&amp;filter.materials.cactus=false&amp;filter.materials.flax=false&amp;filter.materials.seaweed=false&amp;filter.materials.lentils=false&amp;filter.materials.mussels=false). You can set up multiple alts there and have each farm while you wait for the trees to respawn every few hours.
---
I think they recently had a sale but you never know. They have upped marketing and promotions recently.
---
Ya, it's been a common request to get some better rewards from CM raids. Many of them are very difficult though (I'm looking at you Dhuum) so it can be a worthy goal to try for.

I'd honestly play GW1 on mobile no problem. Movement isn't fast paced or crazy, tapping skills or enemies would work fine for the most part and you could maybe make a 'next target' for allies and enemies

Magi's Druid with Lingering Light and Glyph of Unity for the billion HP heals.
---
Just be mindful that they don't include NVidia beta drivers in the repo, only stable ones, so if this requires NVidia 430 you'll need the graphics-drivers PPA
---
Power dragonhunter gets better DPS than power firebrand but doesn't provide group quickness. Fractals focus on power damage (faster kills, better burst) so you won't find a condi firebrand there (though honestly it would do better than a lot of other condi builds especially if you were running grieving or something, still not recommended). Also the idea behind quickness firebrand is that you use it and a renegade to cover your quickness/alacrity needs and not need a chrono to provide them.
---
I'm also in a LUKS mounted drive
---
Fractals wants berserker [like so](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/hybrid-firebrand) on DPS. Raids can go [berserker](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/power%20quickness/) (+ a couple diviner) or [viper](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition%20quickness/) for quickness or [full DPS](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition/).
---
Yes!
---
You could probably achieve a similar look with gw2hook.
---
I only have one character with full inventory out of 23.  80-100 slots is manageable, but having 160 feels really, *really* nice.
---
you are so correct. Perhaps if the tech gets to the point where you dont have to worry about those scenarios and a pebble on the ground wont block LOS and connection issue are a thing of the past. Until then what we got is the best option.
---
Gear wise, you should have at least full exotics and preferably a few ascended items, so you're perfect. Experience-wise, the fact that you know and have practiced a rotation is huge and puts you ahead of plenty of others that are getting into raids. As long as you're willing to listen and learn the mechanics, I'd say you're more than ready. 
---
I was lucky and most of my guild decided to start learning how to raid together, but finding groups, especially consistent ones, isn't always that easy (although it could be, depending on your guild/friends). You can always search for "training" or "casual" groups in lfg, either in lfm or by putting your own listing up. Heck, just typing in "-sell" will get you more relevant results. Also, there are some good communities, guilds, and discords dedicated to learning how to raid and finding groups afterwards. In the [guides](https://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/guides) section of the sidebar/wiki here, specifically under the raid mentorship heading, there's a good listing of guilds and discords that run and train raids. The big discords for NA are Raiders in Training and The Raider's Inn, while EU has the Raid Training Initiative and The Crossroads Inn. You probably also know that sites like Snow Crows and Metabattle have strong builds (although still updating from the recent patch, but I'm not sure how much guardians/DHs were affected) and both SC and Dulfy, plus the GW2Wiki, have good guides for each encounter.
---
This is so good.
---
Ain't even mad, you beautiful beast!
---
If you look above the waypoint there seems to be some type of black rift. It’s kinda in the shape of kralk’s triangle head, so I’m assuming like most that’s it’s some type of contested waypoint.
---
So...let me get this straight, you just want more windows that you can break?
---
I think one of the other main issues is the lack of break-bars.  Siren's Reef has zero break-bars during the Captain Crowe fight.  I think the boss fight is an experiment in a divergent boss fight that players can't "break &amp; burn" for a 10-15s victory.  The theme is a drawn out battle on a pirate ship, but the meta resolves extensively around exposed, burst DPS with minimal CC, sustain &amp; utility.  
---
"Break &amp; Burn," is a big part of why I don't really find Fractals particularly fun anymore.  Everything morphs into a DPS golem.  The entire point of meta-compositions like FB-Ren is to maximize DPS  w/ minimal CC or utility.  It's a very static and uninteresting way to play the game amongst strong enough players because the bosses don't stand a chance.  Siren's Reef?
---
I don't think the fight would be so bad if the arena weren't so small.  It quickly becomes over-saturated with pressure from adds and it seldom feels like there's a "safe" spot to stand.   It also becomes very difficult to group with your allies and scales horribly with instabilities like afflicted, we bleed fire, boon overload or outflanked.
---
They should rehash the scribe so it's more afforsable, and let us use decorations in home instances. That would be a great xpac size feature. Half the shit is already there
---
I dunno, I was never really excited for the guild halls at all as I didn't play GW1, or Wildstar, or any other MMO with large-scale housing, but being in the SPUD Club and having tons of decorations and doing themes where everyone interested decorated the hall, was really fun.
---
I haven't participated in a while, and not sure I would drop much money decorating my home instance, but I think the way they did guild hall decorating was successful. I do agree with someone up further about there needing to be a free-camera mode while decorating.

Depends on the player.
---
Teapot is hardcore by many accounts, and he has said multiple times how he has put a ludicrous amount of money into the game.
---
Plus, if ANET began to also cater more to hardcore audiences in some areas, they would be more likely to invest in the game and put money into it.
---
Hardcore players aren't a group famed for being frugal, they just play more than others which translates to:
---
A. Having more in game gold to turn into gems (which casuals would as well if they had the in-game currency)
---
B. They are less satisfied with ANET's content in both pace and efficacy. 
---
If lets say, ANET released more content, which was more challenging, then B would change, and I don't see why they wouldn't invest money into the game. 
---
People always miss that while Casuals are more profitable, because they tend to throw money at things with little persuasion, Hardcore players are the lifeblood of the game. Casuals look up guides from Hardcore players to learn things. They adjust their playstyles (even if they don't like to think so) in the footsteps of the Hardcore players (even many casuals nowadays run Zerker gear for example). 
---
The Hardcore players have a huge passion for GW2, and want it to succeed due to their heavy emotional and time investment, but in it's current state, they might not be satisfied enough to put money into it. Who is to say this won't change if ANET's development style changed?
---
I hold a really high opinion of GW1, it has its strengths, and GW2 has its strengths. That said without the playerbase GW1 does not make me want to play it. I wanna play it like in the old days and be able to gather a party of players everywhere I go. Playing with bots is not how GW1 is meant to be played.
---
Hmm ... I am okay with most of it except the grab treasure -&gt; kill ghost sequences. They feel tedious. Are the spawns on a timer? That always makes things feel like a drag.

It's the last of this set that we were promised 3 (4?) years ago. I doubt they'd start making them considering that legendaries are a pretty big part of what people look forward to each episode but this is the last one we know for certain is coming.
---
When LS5 was revealed to come immediately after LS4 and everyone was wondering why the two were separate at all then, I did consider that perhaps they were separate feature-wise: that LS5 episodes didn't or didn't need to contain legendaries and that they wanted to make that clear with a new title. But as I said, I think they're just too big a part of the patch to stop making them and it seems that actually designing the legendary isn't holding anything back, it's just the journey that was the problem.
---
Huh? i Could be wrong, but i think there's a Bear Norn there, or was he in the Sylvari Prison in the Groove?

check out the guild recruitment sub on the side bar. 
---
as a side note "No negative comments" and "a guild where people get offended from words cause I'll be kicked within the hour" dont line up so well. Maybe you need to work on you a bit. No hate. Just sayin.

I know... I was waiting for someone to make it but then nobody did so I had to be the change I wanted to see
---
No, *you*
---
I mean, without emphasis on movement in combat and the skills the way they are it sounds a bit like a card game like Hearthstone. I don't know if that design makes combat any better.
---
&gt; This should have no place in real world 
---
Really? You find a credit card with code on the street and use it. Of course it will go through initially, as whatever place you use it cannot know that it isn't yours. That still doesn't mean that what you did is ok and that whatever you bought is yours. That also doesn't mean that you should expect no consequences. At the very least, the place where you used the card has the right to perma-ban you, for trying to scam them, don't you think?
---
It's not just the combat. Everything about its gameplay philosophy makes it superior to GW2. I don't have to grind for "ascended" armor to get the best stats like in GW2. I can just go into Consulate Docks in Kamadan and buy it off the NPC for next to nothing. This is how GW2 promised it would be, but then people complained "hurr durr exotic armor is too easy to get, there is nothing to do!!" And ANET pretended like that wasn't the point and said "oh we always meant to add stupidly grindy bullshit armor with better stats".

Heritage armor only requires 6 points to get it all, which is really easy with just the base game and EotN (linking the accounts will give you 3 points) and a single gold mini pet will get you another two points.

And it doesn't detract from the seriousness of the rest if the mission that is not a cut-scene? Just turn it off for story missions.
---
You don't even need ascended armor apart from high t4 and the stat increase you get from upgrading your armor is minimal when compared with upgrading weapon/trinkets which are basically handed to you.
---
 Its also not too bad to get full ascended armor, its 50-60g per armor piece afaik. Thats not a grind.
---
Well, the only information we have is May. Surely if the exact information was available you would have been able to find it yourself instead of asking? Why would we magically have more information available than you?
---
I love it.
---
&gt; I want easy access to max stat gear for no effort just like in GW1
---
That sounds a little too much to ask for. GW2 is a game. You need to play it to win. You need to develop your character. You should not be handed everything on a silver platter on day one.
---
Oh my, we better not be starting a witch hunt. Best be leaving out the name and account there.
---
To add info on the wood spawns
---
* the nodes respawn every hour since they only are "regular" nodes and not "rich" ones
---
* there was/is squads called "multiwood squads" and the general idea is to hop in another instance of the map and gather the nodes all over again without having to wait for 1h (a bit like Tarir multiloot worked)
---
You know what I am fine removing his name but if he claims his guild doing it always.. i dont see problems name and shame such a guild..
---
Is deepstone being a hated fractal a common opinion? I think it's really fun with all the mechanics they have going on with it.
---
Ban is permanent with no way to lift it. 
---
Put thanos meme here.
---
You had.
---
This. I can't believe how annoying it is that stability is so useless against this stuff.
---
Cheers!
---
Well that's what I expect coming from GW1. If it's not going to be like that then it shouldn't be called GW2. It's clearly a completely different game and that's not what they marketed it as. Either way, I have over 20 sets of ascended gear after 7 years, so I've played enough to know exactly how much effort it takes to get them. And it's not comparable *at all* to the ease of acquisition in GW1. Not by a long shot. Sure different people will have different measures for what is considered grind. To you 60g might not be a lot, but to someone that only plays 2 hours a day it's the world. And GW1 made sure to cater to those that only play 2 hours/day and still give them max stat gear far faaaaar easier compared to GW2. That's my beef with GW2 and that's why I even commented in the first place that GW1 is the better game. To the person I replied originally, it's because of the combat. To me - it's because of what I define as grind.
---
You summed up how every whisper spam plays out - there is no logic to it, it just happens, making 0 sense. Thats why the pm convos are usually started by the most idiotic dumb players you can find and their language honestly just reflects that.
---
&gt; I have never seen people outright leave a group because one particular fractal was on, no matter the instabilities
---
Anecdotal but I've been seen people do this every single fractal roll out. From Thermanova to Sirens.
---
People want T4s to be like their daily boss runs and will leave at any sign of trouble or new mechanic.
---
The worst thing about Deepstone is people who don't bring CC and people who don't bind their special action key. Oh and its dark.
---
Gayyyyyyyyy
---
GW1 was a game, too, and it worked exactly like that.
---
This game is missing stuff for classes that can strip boons to do.
---
I simply dont care about rating and points. just about the actual games and rewards.
---
they are different kind of games, period. GW1 is a heavy strategy game that is solo friendly while GW2 is more an action RPG that requires cooperation between multiple players for most things. Therefore they cannot be compared objectively. After all you may like one style more than the other.
---
take rez orbs, enter the council chamber instance of Rata Sum, jump off the edge, rez orb after falling to death, repeat sliding down the city....You're now at the bottom of the cube....enjoy :)
---
Yuck
---
Honestly, i agree. It’s your image after all. If people wanna act like asshats then maybe they’ll think twice before acting like that again when they see their name posted. Besides, people stream the game without telling others, ‘hey, FYI, I’m streaming and your character and play style are being viewed.’ Post whatever you want, imo
---
From what I can tell he is a Spellbreaker, as you can see him use full counter in the launch trailer.
---
Around 1:40-1:50.
---
Dunkoro is bae
---
you can do "Fractals of the mists" and buy 20-slot bags for fairly low effort/cost.  
---
I do not know how hard it is the find people for T1 fractals though, but try the LFG tool in a tab in the "friends" window
---
Probably have to give a cut to steam as well, but otherwise I don't know why.
---
Fuck me, just bought the complete collection for me and my friend last week for $40 each XD
---
My biggest issue is the clashing textures. There's polished metal mixed with animal parts mixed with glowing magical energy mixed with fiery crystals mixed with demon horns. I could probably close my eyes and select 6 random pieces of armor but dye them all Sincerity Valor and Ghost and I'd get upvotes :/ my biggest pet peeve with armor posts is when people use different kinds of metal or materials sporadically through the look. Or worse, if they use multiple pieces of armor with clashing patterns..... Ugh
---
People can't get offended on discord? lol
---
It's not just a matter of being banned or not banned. It's a matter of offending people. Sometimes people are really sensitive, but sometimes, there are different people with different cultures, different backgrounds, different age ranges, different ideas of what constitutes offense. You're going to offend someone at some point no matter how careful you are.
---
But if you know you're more generally offensive, discord is not really an answer or wouldn't be in my guild, because if I find someone overtly offensive, I'll ask them to leave discord or kick them out anyway. 
---
Some guild leaders protect the members of their guild from certain types of comments. Where that line is varies from guild to guild.  We're not puritans in my guild, but there are still lines I wouldn't like to see crossed.
---
Every race has really good and flavorful quests for early levels. It's really up to you which side of the setting you want to explore.
---
I like Charr... but I'm a Furry so...
---
Glyph of Empowerment was removed in the last update. This means druid now doesn’t bring any profession specific buffs for power classes aside from frost spirit, which doesn’t matter since a power soulbeast can bring the spirit. Therefore, in fractals and power favored raids are run optimally with firebrigade (quickness firebrand and alacrity renegade). The old chrono druid comp is still great, just not the best compared to firebrigade. Especially in pugs and moderate skilled runs, druid is still accepted. 
---
Bs warrior is still the same overall; power core and condi berserker.
---
Then you have off healers: tempest, scourge, and scrapper.
---
Scrapper is not very good in PvE, but dominates as a bunker in PvP and a healer in WvW, if you’re into that stuff. Firebrand is also an amazing choice for WvW support as well.
---
Scourge is an amazing group carrier through barrier and rez power.
---
Tempest outputs garbage tons of heals and has some aura mechanic too. Dunno much about it, just that it heals like crazy.
---
Overall, I’d say keep your druid. I can still be used if you’re not running the most optimal stuff for record runs or something. But now there are many other options and class diversity is great right now.
---
Oh yea also spirits can be healed so they never leave you :D
---
Gosh, communication's great.  It gives us something to look forward to, and it gives the game a future, instead of not knowing something till a week before it ships   I love the new anet.
---
No, he has done that in the past, like saying you can control wall spawning on Desmina, that you can block the flame wall on Sabetha or that you can aegis sloth's shake.
---
You can use turrets underwater
---
Sylvari is the best race to experience the story with imo, you are introduced to a certain planty boi early on and its a lot less jarring when he shows up later in the story since other races don't interact with him before that point but as a Sylvari you are already familiar with him.
---
For raids druid is still the go to healer mainly for the damage and utility they provide. They just got a nerf to pet damage (20% weaker pets when you pick druid) but it shouldn't change much as they still provide full group might, damage buffs with spirits, fury, protection, spotter, etc. If your group is bringing a second healer though your options have gotten better with [renegade](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/heal/) and [firebrand](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/heal/) being meta picks along with [support scourge](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/scourge/heal/). Tempest and scrapper still heal for a ton (and are great at dealing with conditions) but don't bring a whole lot else to the group. Honorable mention to [heal thief](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/thief/thief/boon/) (only applicable to Mat and MO really). 
---
As for fractals the better groups don't run a druid and instead opt for firebrand, renegade, soulbeast, warrior (maybe berserker now), and another DPS like weaver or dragonhunter. The firebrand/renegade both are hybrid DPS + boons and cover quickness/alacrity, soulbeast can cover frost spirit, warrior has banners. Lots of pug groups will run druid + chrono though or even heal firebrand/renegade to carry the team. 
---
All in all I'd say druid is still the most damage primary healer you'll find, especially considering they stack might and bring so much else. Of course if you head into WvW it's nothing but scrappers and firebrands, I'd consider druid as one of the worst options there.
---
My problem is more that a new person will look at these, think that the information is correct and then wonder why he fails. It's the misinformation that's annoying me. More "hardcore" raiders have long given up on Tekkit and his guides and I have been told by many people in the past "oh I saw you arguing with Tekkit, give it up, it's pointless". So they know to take everything with a grain of salt. Newbies don't. Off and on I've been running training raids for years now and I always keep telling people not to trust everything in these guides and I keep occasionally getting questions like "but can you really *not* block the sabetha wall?"
---
Thanks for the answer, I didn't knew there where a disc for ele. I will try to upload a log file in the day. That might help me really hard
---
While I play mainly humans and sylvari, I enjoyed the Charr storyline a lot. I'm not sure if I'm accurate on this, but it felt like the story chapters were longer than of the other races, which by all means is nothing to complain about.
---
I play games mainly for the storylines so this was a welcome surprise.
---
We will see.
---
Many ppl, including me, thought the Griffin could fly.
---
I wait to hear what you hear when the first ones have it.
---
If people didn't want challenge at all they would be asking for there to be no mobs and nothing threatening, but that is not what people are saying. I'm reading most people saying it doesn't feel fun because it's too long compared to other options, it's annoying how often they're getting cced with no way to prevent it due to stability not functioning, there are too many adds that can't be dealt with for the last encounter because they are spread out and out of range to get pulled in with poison gas that kills you if you try to approach them, etc. There's a difference between not wanting to be challenged and not liking something because it doesn't feel enjoyable.
---
It's worth mentioning: if you want to go beyond 100 slots, you should upgrade *in this order*. At current gem exchange rate, it's a lot more cost effective to get a new slot and put pretty much whatever into it, than it is to make a 32-slot bag (Except for the LW 4 episode 2 one, which you can get through achievements). For reference:  
---
139 gold converts to 400 gems converts to 1 bag space. Add 10 gold for the 20 slot bag, just to pick the biggest basic bag, and we get about 150 gold for 20 slots, or 7.5 gold/slot.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
According to gw2efficiency, a 32-slot saddlebag takes about 143 gold to craft. Subtract 10 since we're assuming that we're using an existing 20-slot bag to help craft this, and it's 133 gold for 12 new slots, or about 11 gold/slot. That's about a 50% increase in price. 
---
tl;dr, buying new bag spaces through gem conversion is way, way more effective than upgrading to 32-slot bags.
---
"Yep again, I'm not dumb I can read it's may"  
---
Hmmmm
---
So I must be in fire the most of the time. Ex: I have my air 3 up, I should precast it then immediately swap to fire attunement going in fire air while the air air 3 is making dmg?
---
It's not impossible, but compared with his model, his spikes have a slightly different shape - but I'm not sure if we have only seen his head and neck so far.
---
The [teaser from a few weeks ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdUvX34yWXc) shows more of the whole dragon, but the sideview is also only head and neck (you get a good view at 0:20).
---
However, not impossible. Could we worth starting a post about this, because this is buried deep in the comments.
---
I am willing to help out with new guides. I absolutely refuse to watch each one of your old guides (again) and point out what's wrong in them (again). These are your guides, your name stands on them, you should do that.
---
Well it was 155 USD for 3 campaigns and expansion originally.
---
Thanks for typing that out.
---
I have most classes (except Renegade/Tempest) leveled to 80 but not particularly geared.  I'm sitting on a fair amount of resources (600g, two months of the daily ascended crafting mats, about two months of most of the LS3 gathering things).  So I can basically choose any one guy to gear out very well.  What kind of overlap is there for gear?  I imagine if I geared the Druid it's pretty worthless for anything else, but I might be able to share gear for Guardian/Revenant and Scourge/Tempest.
---
If you have proof of what you're saying, it's not a witch hunt. You have the screenshots of him offending you, so you don't have to hide his name afaik.
---
Nobody has factual evidence that housing will come. It's my prediction that I believe to be accurate, because what else is there for Anet to do?
---
There has been a recent increase in "ironman" players, an idea taken from runescape.
---
These players out the word iron in their character name and do not open the xunlai chest or trade (some choose to trade with each other). There are a few guilds and they play through the story only with other iron players.
---
could've sworn they were there last time I ran it, may be wrong tho
---
Anet probably did this on purpose to extend the time you play Living World episodes since they are so short to begin with ;p ;p ;p
---
Thanks.  I asked the other person to reply [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bhywi0/weekly_rguildwars2_question_thread_april_27_2019/emaqxut/) what kind of gear overlap there is.  I'd be more interested in gearing something that can share gear with other classes.
---
sylvari probably, i actually prefer the racial stories, after that it all goes downhill. if you are interested in well written stories, characters and lore, i would not recommend gw2. SWTOR or ESO would suit you better.
---
But ascended gear is still entirely optional in any content apart from fractals. I am not sure whats the problem. How is 30 extra power going to matter in open world? You would still rely on your skills and reaction times to kill stuff.
---
In total it should cost you like 300-400g to get ascended armor. In getting the gold there is no rush, you can get the gold from playing any content you like and doing some story/cosmetic achievements actually give you ascended armor pieces. 
---
I am not sure calling ascended armor a grind when its largely optional, when you can choose the content you do for it, when you can choose your own time schedule and when it can come from ingame achievements do it justice.
---
Also, use the LFG to find a populated map. It's not unusual to have one or two very populated maps and then a few nearly dead ones.
---
Shooting from the hip here, but I had a similar problem in another game. Random disconnects in places where I'd been active. I couldn't find anyone with the same problem as me, but I managed to fix it by going through all router settings. Maybe it'll help you: If you can access your router settings, some of them have a kind of priority list, where all connected machines are present with a priority. This setting might be really hard to find. Anyway, all machines have standard priority, but if you change yours to high it might solve your problem.
---
Hope it works, dc's are so frustrating in gw2 instances :(
---
Ah ok, if you want to swap gear around healing [renegade](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/heal/) and [firebrand](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/heal/) both want harrier same with the fractal variants of [firebrand](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Firebrand_-_Support_Healer) and [renegade](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Renegade_-_Boon_Support_Healer). Also by "support" do you just mean healers or would you be fine playing a a boon support since those are options too. I will say what works in one game more (fractals) isn't going to work in another (WvW) and most of the builds there are very different (most healers and supports run full minstrel) and not something you'd see in PvE.
---
Is Random Arenas still alive in Europe so I can do an Echo + Blackout spam mes?
---
Drop danger time for improved alacrity. 
---
The greatsword is a ranged attack weapon, so you lose some survivability that you make up for with range. It's worth keeping a shield on you for when you need to go toe-to-toe with something nasty.
---
You gave him the attention he wanted. He won.
---
if i and others have managed to map gw2 to controllers, gw1 should be a piece of cake :p
---
I really like this fractal, esp. the boss fight is very well done
---
But not in factions where he just fucking stays behind healing minions.
---
It's a really nice rendition of LA/HoT themes and I'd certainly love to hear the actual live version (since this is obviously a demo) but... That video painfully reminded me how much of HoT we didn't get in the end... :c
---
Why do people not read what i write? My belife is that A-Net loose buy opertunities because you check through the gemstore, you run in to lisences and you think oh i wonder how they look like, the store it self do not offer this. Now if you really are looking for this and really want to find out, you can go out side of the game and check it out or check the mount section in the game and try to figure out which one that belongs to the right liscense. But that demands effort and regardless what you or even me feel about that (because i my self always check them on youtube), it means that not everybody interested in the skins are going to look for it. They simply gonna think meh to much effort, or i am new how the hell do i find a way to see this meh w/e screw the skins and leave or the like. And THAT is my point here. Not that there is no way at all to find out, just that it is not in the store where you are shopping. 
---
It is like in real life were you shop something, the store offer you visibillity of what it is you buy. It is not very likely that you randombly buy a box of something you have no clue what it is or how it looks like and have to look it up on the net first. 
---
The store also always have things lying around the for you to grab randomly because it caught your interest when you past it. 
---
I mean come on do i really need to explain how you in a real life store get manipulated in to buying things you did not intend to buy but when you saw it you wanted it?
---
14 years ?
---
Should work with 418 too. As long as your drivers have the new vulkan extensions, you should be fine.
---
A lot of people kept going for expensive cosmetic armor but a shit ton of progression was in skill capping. In gw2 you're basically done with your core skills once you're level 80 and it doesn't take long to max your 2 elite specs. In gw1 to get elite skills you had to go out into the world and kill the boss that had those elites. A lot of builds revolved around elite skills so often times my guildies and I would go skill capping in multiple characters. It wasn't a gear based game at all. Having max armor was just the beginning of shit you could do.
---
Vistas are super-easy even with just Springer, no need for fancy masteries :D
---
I find that sometimes even with other metal items. Some of them are super reflective, some of them aren't, some of them look different in different maps/loading screen. I notice it a lot in Istan, weirdly. I think the colour palette there is different.
---
Up to you to be honest, all races have their own story at the beginning and if you are a lore nerd (like i am) you should really play through them all. Each personal story are also slightly different depending on what you pick when making it. What is best is really for you to decide. Everybody like their own thing.
---
Later in game Arena Net add a few things here and there that are race related or class related and i usually play through every story with several different races and classes to get it all. Ofc that is a long term project and something that will happen when you feel you done a lot of things and what to try something new. But never the less, just pick what you feel suits you for the first and then you will make alts because it is very easy to have alts in this game due to most things being accountbound.
---
Tbh I felt that on the other races too. He's basically gw2's kormir.
---
While you still save a lot, you only need 290 Two-Handed Legendary Shards, not 300.
---
Same. But (spoiler because OP hasn't started yet) I still felt &gt;!genuinely sad at the end of HoT when you had to kill him.!&lt;
---
I really wish anet would buff turrets significantly, like why should necro minions be allowed to be very good (mainly for open world content) but turrets are just left in the dump when they're essentially the same thing? As they are now, not really worth using at all besides rifle turret only for the toolbelt skill and healing turret since forever.
---
For GW2 Anet has been known to be nice and give partial refunds for cases like this, You can probably try your chance with GW1.
---
It's not minimal. Overall you can get about 15%.
---
I am not denying its BiS gear, but its neither needed nor the stat increase matters in general PvE. A piece of ascended armor is still not needed all the way into late t3.
---
As for infusions, they are another thing entirely that you can put on ascended gear. The agony ones are easy to get and the stat increase ones are completely optional. Are you just going to find stuff to get upset about? I mean, you can completely ignore ascended armor and do almost all of the content.
---
After the lay offs? Not really.
---
RA is still alive from what I could see but I think everybody goes to America server (or International? not 100% sure).
---
Yep, that’s true. I didn’t consider it in my calculations out of simplifying reasons :)
---
He's a sword/pistol Holosmith. You can see him using Corona Burst at the very end of the [launch trailer](https://youtu.be/cGZ4X7cER8k).
---
Can you show your recent finished achievements ? If the Family Reunion is there ? Might also happen that you wil not get it inside the instance but it will add itself when you go outside.
---
Yeh okay that’s true :)
---
Is Field of View slider also new?
---
From ascended armor? 15%?
---
I vaguely recall card games being the inspiration for the skill system. The Codex Arena helps back this up I think
---
Endboss is like playing Dance Dance Revolution on hard.
---
i have no problem with that but maybe its a little bit too much.
---
and some of the instabilities are pure cluster fu...
---
Saaaaaaame
---
From ascended gear altogether
---
We are talking about ascended armor here, if you read.
---
Thanks for the heads up! It's ok though, I don't mind paying a little extra to ANET for me and my friend to have fun. I just thought the timing was fairly unfortunate lol.
---
New player and necromancer! That's why!
---
* GW2Navi is useful for accessing info from GW2Timer.com without having to alt-tab
---
* Launchbuddy is nice for saving alt account login info as well as multiboxing
---
Incredible this moron kept his job
---
I can finally start playing!
---
To bad they never stopped the scripted bots, account thieves, and gold sellers that killed the game for real players long long ago..
---
Just go to ANY PvP zone and it’s only bots 24hrs a day.
---
Embarrassing how they bot farm items on multibox accounts and sell them all for “real life cash” which has entirely devalued every single title or accomplishment to zero..
---
Z keys, Ecto, Armbrace, rare mini, rare titles, gold trim guild are all for sale for real life cash by hackers and botters, thieves..
---
That’s what really killed gw1 and now you can’t stand in KMD without seeing spam and getting PM’s from gold seller spam bots...
---
So yes I loved gw1 far far better then gw2 because it was the game from “my days” but as anet allowed the bots to take over it means real players get less and less (because botters can farm mats 24hrs a day on multiple accounts and you take months or else real money to get anything done)
---
The best thing you could see from anet for gw1 would have been a new system of tracking and finally taking down the botters (and the black market money network they run)
---
Alll sorts of websites do it now it’s not just Kiki anymore.... it’s honestly so far out of hand I’m not sure how they could fix it without banning more then 50% of accounts (yep that’s right more then 50% of currently active gw1 accounts are running bots... botters run 40+ accounts 24hrs a day.. players play 1 account for like 4-8hrs stretch max)
---
Same as gw2 PvP bots.. you look at their matches played and do the math which shows them playing 1 match ever 12min for 24hrs straight (something no human player could ever do for days and days on end never stopping.. they even script the inventory sorting!)
---
The rest of us “real accounts” generally haven’t logged in for years due to the problems anet allowed to plague the game (after they turned their attentions to gw2)
---
So sure enjoy gw1 if you never played but you must be VERY careful.. you will see bots, you will talk to bots, they will spam and talk to you..
---
You might even be tempted to bot but remember IF they ban you on gw1 for botting they also perma ban you on gw2 so think long and hard before you make some serious mistakes playing a 10+ yr old dead game from the past.
---
It’s not a dead game because it’s old OR because they stopped skill balance (which is the true death of the game).. it’s dead because the bots are an artificial players base and without them zones would be completely empty and the economy would drop out entirely. (= dead)
---
No TP means all those mats and items are trapped on dead/banned accounts rather then floating for the marketplace SO the bots are the only reason you can still play and the catch 22 is... your not actually “playing” when you run a scripted bot.
---
Soo don’t bother and if you do.. be very careful who you play and/or trade with.
---
Also they do the dumbest hack in gw1 by getting the support to give away account credentials.. They even got Gaile Gray mod account at one time so watch your back if you ever get rich (I would know.. they hacked and sold my gold trim guild for real life cash and the only way to even save my personal account was to link to gw2.. in gw1 they cannot recover lost/stolen items so yeah I got fucked majorly and lost years and years of hard work and investment just so some botter could sell everything I worked toward for real life cash) which is also against TOS so... just don’t go bad is my advice.
---
You want HoM rewards get in and get out quick.. You want to play the story? (YouTube it)
---
You really don’t want to go back to a game full of bots/botters.. botters don’t have the same attitude about the games as you do so they are quick to mass report you with all their accounts and generally just be rich nasty little players (all the while they will tell and challenge you to report them back claiming anet never does a thing so it’s nothing even if they do get banned they can buy 40new accounts the same day and anet loves it because they make money with the new accounts and the damn botters make money with 40brand new accounts again).
---
Takes them less then a few hours and they are back up and running.. posting updates to the gold seller places and everything.. the botters run /ruined gw1 and laugh all the way to the bank
---
Plot twist: Anet forgets to add Exordium shards to the chest. Ok I am scared now.
---
I like the challenge. But it sucks that as a mesmer I can't do anything outside of dodging. The dazing attacks are unblockable, distortions, stab and blocks don't work on the "wind". Portals don't with the treasure, CS + portal did but anet removed it.
---
To me it feels like whoever designed this fractal is very adamant that players play by his rules.
---
I did answer your question, it has better stats because its BiS gear.
---
I mean if all you are upset about is that you are not handed the BiS armor you don't need for majority of the content, thats just pedantic. Functionally, it won't matter if you have ascended or exotic armor majority of the time, and getting it is not even that difficult. God forbid we have goals in the game. But okay, get upset if you want.
---
He has mastery Level 276, and Reaper

In case you werent  /s
---
It’s more realistic cause the only two sources of lights are torches, and the background light isn’t strong at all.
---
&gt; I got the game but still never tried it, since it feels like a "waste" to play GW1 when my PC can handle the latest, much prettier and active GW2.

Well majority don’t find it fun... imo something should be done
---
Now post a screenshot outisde of 100cm. It has a very  heavy post processing and I have doubts that it looks like this in the rest of the world.
---
Indeed I am pedantic and I must have the BiS gear to enjoy the rest of the content that is modified by it, such as skills or taking damage. 
---
Try and do raids in a pug with exotic and see how long that will last before being kicked for not meeting the benchmark numbers. Especially when you're on a time limit and people expect you to finish well before the given time to be considered "good". 
---
GW1 BiS exists in 2 flavors: the easy to get and the hard to get. Functionally identical, only different in cosmetics. That's all ANET had to do for Exotic vs Ascended. But nooo, they had to make it functionally different too. And I will be upset about it and will continue posting to defend GW1's version of it as long as people want me to.
---
Even if I haven't explored them yet?
---
Those 2 points you mentioned are perfect, but also 2 major points which make me not enjoy it
---
You mean the ‘bright’ sky that has no sun and is about the same brightness as a full moon? Yeah no this seems more realistic
---
So in essence, a house where your parental education missed one of the most essential and fundamental parts of live: proper communication on a sophisticated, respecting and friendly way.
---
So now you're communicating in real life like way too many people do under the protective shroud that is anonymity on the internet. Thats not good.
---
Nothing is lost, you can still change. Words aren't just words, they always have a meaning. In fact, EVERY single detail about your communicative style carries a meaning. Tone, body language, context, it all comes together to form a message. Now, if you don't play by the rules, people will always have a hard time correctly understanding you, and you'll hurt many of them. Some less, but some more. You can and should aim to reduce these cases to a minimum.
---
You cannot get the Personal Story achievements a second time by playing through as another race. You get them the first time, only.
---
D I S C O M B O B U L A T E
---
Thank you all for answers! What about class tho?? :D 
---
And in others mmo (except wow vanila) questing is oneshoting everything. Is it the same here too?
---
Have you ever thought of taking a break before you burn out completely?
---
60 power (30 from infusions) you dont get from ascended armor will not lose you the benchmark dps. Your skill will. 
---
In gw2 you have cosmetic armor options and an option to get BiS gear, so that is on top of hat what gw1 has apparently.
---
You are just not happy ascended gear is largely optional, you need the option to be removed altogether basically.
---
Well then you can also take a look what achievements give you red mastery points on the wiki. Comapre the wiki with your accout and then you will see if you have them all or if you are missing. If you will be missing then yes oyu should make a ticket to support.
---
As someone who remembers the communication pre-information embargo, I find it hilarious how happy people are. I mean, I love it, too. But communities forget so fast, it *is* a bit funny to watch.
---
Anyway, cynicism aside. I, too, love the new old Anet. I wonder what happened. Layoffs? Mike Z? Is it just a coincidence that everything changes close to the end of S4? Will they really blow our minds again with S5?  
---
I'm curious and excited for the near future.
---
Kind of lame that they are handing a free griffon out to the ultra casuals
---
Filler is indeed a better word. Deepstone is already barely more than an empty corridor leading from boss to boss. Its two puzzles and lift is all that stands between you and it actually becoming that corridor.
---
...and people still complain. Can't wrap my head around it.
---
I still play it sometimes, going for my second LDoA. Did some missions in the domain of anguish recently too. Might start a new Rit and go through factions again. Gw1 did a lot of stuff well, for instance the combat and in my opinion how it delivered story (through side missions and dialogue). However gw2 has a lot (a lot!) of nice QoL options plus the combat, while different, is also a lot more active.
---
This would probably fit better in the stickied questions thread.
---
I like toy weapons
---
Hi there, Asmongold
---
They matter to us who want to experience them and get more flavor behind each race.
---
Both Necro and mesmer have weapons that are either low or delayed damage (conditions do damage over several seconds, and things like Necro scepter and mesmer staff are mostly condition damage, so they kill weak things much slower.
---
For Necro, you should focus on dagger and axe mainhand, and your offhand will be mostly for utility so pick the one with skills you like better.
---
For mesmer, stick to sword/sword and greatsword for levelling.
---
In general, in addition to the advice above: yellow mobs usually don't get killed regularly, and the longer a mob lives the more xp it is worth. Murder all the innocent animals you see for maximum xp.
---
If i had to guess, according to the [r/steamcontroller wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamController/wiki/config-guide) you can map buttons to click in a specific position on the screen.
---
Alternatively there is [the "Touch Menu" feature](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/steam_controller/touch_menus) which you can then add custom icons to.
---
You'd have to save/load the config for different characters and set them up separately i suppose. But its possible!

I haven't bought any expansions, and i only used Heroic booster yet i leveled so fast. Thanks for this guide

---
I couldn’t find a single sword that looked somewhat decent in that gallery, let alone suitable for a legendary
---
i think it looks kinda cool.
---
that would be a good way to look at it, but consider the fact that gw2 is much more casual and a lot of the playerbase is not as engaged as a result of this. Many people may play the game every lw episode or once a week due to it's casual nature, and not be in the sub.
---
There's discount in gem store from time to time, but you can always purchase episodes. During the previous month episodes of ls4 were free to acquire for a week each, but that's not something they've done with ls3 so far.
---
i have a request too, make all cutscenes skippable
---
They just had every episode of season 4 for free this past month, I doubt they'll do it again soon and I don't see them giving out season 3. The packs do occasionally go on sale and you still have a couple weeks to get episode 5 before 6 and the season 4 pack (which reduces the cost of all of them).
---
Nice try.
---
Weird. I logged in last night to buy these and didn't see them.
---
“majority”
---
Source?
---
This is clearly a Burger King toy smh my head...
---
That‘s a low blow against woman, because Samarog was created by a woman and named after her.
---
And i heard that the one who made Xiuquatl was also the one who made now Exordium.
---
I'm sorry you have a small penis.
---
I hope this post gets deleted
---
Ahh...didnt know you could map it that way. Thanks for info.
---
Guardian, warrior, thief, elementalist, ranger, necro, enji, mesmer
---
Probably in this order, but difference is minimal
---
There are a bit more things to consider here that make the levelling process slow.
---
Movement: In general, the faster you are in the world the faster you are at new enemies to kill or new locations to explore. Almost, if not all, professions have the ability to passively increase their movement speed or at least have skills to give them swiftness.
---
Gear: This is probably the issue many new players have. Gear has attributes that boost your effectiveness in some way. Most new players don't spend time reading this and only see 'bigger numbers' and equip it. However, if you find defensive gear with Toughness, healing power and other things then you will have little damage and feel weak. The same applies to your build, if you use skills or weapons that are more focused on one damage type like Condition damage but you gear up with Direct Damage then you will also feel weak because it just doesn't match. The General Consensus is that, while levelling, you should favour offensive gear with Power, Precision, Ferocity.
---
Gaining EXP: This seems Trivial but many things get overlooked, a lot of things will reward you with EXP in this game, reviving NPCs or other players, exploring, Vista, Point of Interest, Events, Crafting and many more. Another way is just the good old 'kill stuff' and most players just kill the aggressive, red, Enemies and totally neglect the passive, yellow, mobs. The thing is, in GW2, the longer an enemy is alive the more Bonus EXP will they accumulate (to a certain degree). And since nobody kills those yellow mobs they will give a good chunk of EXP just because nobody killed them for a while. Which means, if you travel around the world then kill everything in your sight.
---
The suggested level on the other hand is not really something you need to pay attention to. The only thing you could do is that when you finished a map and have to go to the next one and you are not that close to the level displayed on the map then you can go to other maps with a lower level first. It won't change how you level because your level will be dynamically adjusted depending on the Zone you are in (the green arrow pointing down). Which means, you have your actual level that you get EXP etc for and you have the effective level which will reduce your attributes so that you are similar to the level in the zone you are in.
---
No offense, but if they made it any faster you might as well start at max level.
---
Or after you finish the maze.
---
But collections aren’t the only way to get precursors. It seems like gw2 is definitely not his type of game
---
Looks like [Alexander Youngblood](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bj50ec/war_eternal_arrived_this_may/em5z6t8/?context=1000) had a hand in creating Exordium.
---
What do we know about the new legendary armors? They look like finally introducing PvP/WvW skins for the legendary armor
---
Yeah cause the game is literally the opposite of what he wants
---
He judged the game based on the video he saw... and the game clearly isn’t right for him
---
I like the new way of thinking. Temporalelly changing Gameplays, like the WvW change. I:m happy that they created a tram again for pvp and wvw modes, especially the last one. It's the only game I know with a gameplay like that and makes the game unique. They should focus a little more in it.
---
We'll see what the future holds for us ;)
---
my bad
---
The silly NPE (new player experience) is to thank for that... i.e. unlocking dodging, vistas, map visibility, etc. as you level up...
---
hai cira! Thanks for explaining it for lazy people.
---
It all depends on what you want to do. The best and worst thing about warriors is that we have SO MANY WEAPONS. I'll see if I can give a decent rundown.
---
Axes attack very quickly and deal great damage. The fact that some of their skills grant boons is even better. They're great for building up adrenaline quickly through attacking, and also work well with any "on-hit" or "on-crit" effects (at least without a cooldown).
---
Greatswords are also another great power damage weapon. They're not as fast as axes, but hit hard and have good movement skills.
---
Maces are huge sources of hard cc (hard crowd control effects, like stuns or launches). They're actually used in meta power warrior builds in raids because they're so good at breaking the boss' defiance/break bar.
---
Hammers are also great sources of cc, as well as AoE damage.
---
Swords are one of the two condition damage weapons for (base) warrior, along with the longbow. Swords have so much bleeding and soft cc (like crippled and immobilized), and as a condition warrior main, I love it. The sword 2 leap is also pretty fun, whether to initiate or get back to a fight or to jump across pits when running around the open world.
---
Longbows are the other condition damage weapon, except instead of bleeding, they set everything on fire, as well as provide good soft cc (immobilized and blinded), plus they recently added bleeding onto their bow 5 immobilize skill. They also have a fire field in their adrenaline burst and a blast finisher in their bow 3 skill to build might.
---
Rifle is good ranged single target damage.
---
Shields of course block and stun enemies. 
---
Warhorns grant boons and support allies.
---
So really, whichever fits your fancy, or get one or two of each and switch whenever you get bored. For leveling especially, they're all pretty much equally viable (raids...are a different story, but even then most are still good). Gear-wise, with any class, you're going to want to focus on items with power (damage), precision (critical chance), and ferocity (critical damage), pretty much in that order. Once you reach level 80, if you want to focus on condition damage, try to find viper's gear, with power, condition damage (self explanatory), precision, and expertise (condition duration), otherwise Berserker's gear (power, precision, ferocity) is the best for power damage.
---
Yeah. Love the game, but the community on reddit and the forums is a big no
---
Except not really, because this isn't an issue with being a bit harder content like raids, it's a bad design issue.
---
Have you posted on the official forums, Anet may want to learn about this.
---
Not for years and even HA was only mildly active during double weeks.. Sadly botters and syncer run all PvP now
---
I'm gonna go ahead and say yur family is bad and yu are toxic for saying that I'm toxic and will be better off without me.
---
Personally i love power chrono, very fun and intricate to play
---
Why?
---
Hahaha That was a nice one but you hurt my feelings :P
---
*Laughs in Kourna*
---
It was honestly spontaneous
---
Class has no impact on the storyline as far as I am aware. Some minor dialogue options change, but that's doesn't impact the story.
---
He wasn't shunned because he was an outsider, he was shunned because he refuses to accept that he might not be an expert on something he has zero fucking experience with.
---
The community is welcoming to people that come to the game with interest and sincerity.  he wasn't looking into the game because he had any real interest in it, his mob of fuckwits just pushed him to look at some videos so he could shit on things under the cover of being an MMO "expert/critic".
---
Literally the same thing.
---
Or [WvW](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Siegemaster%27s_Satchel). Just follow a zerg if there's any commander on the server
---
Lots of episodes of Season 4 have been free over the last year. *Long Live the Lich* has been free three times in the past year. 
---
Seasons 2 and 3? Unlikely, but they do get discounts occasionally. 
---
For Season 2, you're basically paying for the story. 
---
Season 3 has new maps (that are very popular due to the ease of getting fairly good rewards) and new events and so is pretty good bang for your buck. 
---
Season 4 has a good story, but several of the maps are a bit underwhelming, in my opinion, partly because the early ones lack variety and feel a bit too big. The meta events could use a rework too, I think, but they're not as awful as some of the Path of Fire ones.
---
axe 3 is great for cc and axe 2 is good fury generation
---
  
---
mace is better for healing, but you have a decent amount of healing already to be honest, so if you need the cc or party buffs, axe is just fine and don't hamper you too much
---
and don't ever give up staff. it's great. staff 1 now does decent damage but mostly it has good range finally. staff 3 can help do things more quickly or reposition more easily by providing swiftness. staff 4 is a great heal and generates might. and staff 2 now is a blast finisher. use it on a fire field (F1 tome 4) for aoe might, water field (F2 tome 4) for aoe healing, or light field (axe, mace 2, staff 3,F3 tome 4, various others) for aoe cleanse. staff is a great support weapon for firebrand
---
What are those trading posts you are talking about? 
---
I was looking to buy better gear but all guys just seem to sell stuff worse than my current equipment :D
---
Wait a minute...Core?
---
The main difference looks like "You want to be pretty or edgy?"
---
PvP wise, both are strong. But Herald seems a bit of a safer, albeit more difficult, class due to the recent nerfing of Mesmer builds. I'm only saying this off memory from what I remember of patch notes (Don't pvp much myself, and never really learnt any meta).
---
PvE, Chrono is stronger as a dps class, but the alternative spec to Herald for Revenant (Renegade) has an extremely strong DoT based build and support build that runs quite dps oriented gear with some buff duration in it.
---
What about the rest of the playerbase?
---
Have fun asking each of them.
---
yea, thing is, every class does use the same keys - some just have more F skills. So if you manage to map everything including F1-5 then youre set.
---
Essentially, you use modifiers. What I did was make (using xbox controller names here bc thats what i use) LB, LT and RB modifier buttons, that modified ABXY. (RT was for autoattack) Action camera is also vital, so I put the toggle for that on some button too.
---
So what I did is:
---
A/B/X/Y - interact, dodge, heal skill, special action
---
LB+A/B/X/Y - weaponskills 2-5
---
RB+A/B/X/Y - utilities and elite
---
LT+A/B/X/Y - F1-F4 (i dont remember what I bound F5 to, if I'm to be honest, but it shouldnt be hard, could just bind it to LT+RT or smth tbh)
---
don't remember what weaponswap was on, select..?
---
then you have some buttons left for other actions - d-pad, joystick presses, start/select. If you want to, you can make some of THESE modifiers too, giving you even more buttons to use. I think I did that for mount keybinds.
---
It's a little cramped, but possible. I did this using Xpadder, though it did have some quirks that made it not work perfectly as intended. I've heard it's a lot easier to do with a steam controller, so perhaps look into that?
---
Just as a note, the "Select License" costs 3 times as much as the random one.
---
So for the same price of 1/15, you could 3/15 random ones. Food for thought for those it applies to
---
The main role for thieves in PvE in DPS, and they're a totally viable DPS class, though no longer the best.
---
Glad you found it ^^
---
ArcDPS has interesting links: https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/x64/README-links.txt
---
Most of the things that ANet says about why ArcDPS is ok can also be applied to gw2hook.
---
Reshade: Yes
---
Gw2Hook: Yes
---
ArcDPS: Yes
---
General rule of addons is as long as it doesn't provide any obvious advantage to you over an enemy, it's good.
---
In Arc's case, all the information it uses is stuff you can see without it. It just processes the information for you
---
and skips
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/65547/policy-third-party-programs#latest
---
ArenaNet does not review, approve, or endorse any third-party program. Each use of such a program is made by an account holder at their own risk.
---
Thanks for the info! Why would a fractial party take a thief if they could get a better dps?
---
Even if the waypoint appears to be in the instance, like not in the red kicking zone?
---
aw yis please
---
it's exceedingly obvious that you made this post about that specific situation.
---
equating it with any other criticism is a bad faith argument.  it's also flat out wrong, there's TONS of criticism here and few of it is viewed as toxic.
---
lastly, it's not the criticism that's toxic, it's how it's delivered.
---
I mean...you can use that rationale, but then none of the story matters at all, since open world will still be the same regardless.
---
Hell if you really want to get pedantic about what "matters" it's just a game. Your time would be better spent working, or exercising...or even sleeping. The whole game literally doesn't matter.
---
turrets were never good in pve.  
---
you can use them if you don't care about anything or you want to afk farm (which is not allowed by the rules btw, just saying).
---
I made the same mistake as a not new player.
---
Soo basically you don't like getting busted in zergs.
---
Guardián with GS farm asf im a phyco farming character, I did like 7 rangers lvl 80 4 guardians lvl 80 2 warriors 3 engis 2 revenants 1 necro 5 thiefs and only left mesmer and ele, and I must say that aoe dmg is the best for lvl up with power dmg, like GS users, and I think that imo guardián is the best role, and one tricky advise, farm enemies far away from hearts, I discovered, that enemies that never been killed, most of them water enemies since people don't wanna go underwater give most exp than usual, I mean, centaurs for example near to heart or the same heart give shit exp but go near to some. Beach and kill marine monsters, I streamed some lvl ups I can help you bro dm if you need something
---
necro minions are shit for openworld content too. nuking with wells is so much more effective. only minion which shines is the elite one because of cc.
---
That would be the wet dream of the worse kind of ganker out there.
---
If anything, downed state should still kick in if someone goes down under 3 seconds from the start of the fight, even during no downed estate events.
---
&gt; it’s us being the toxic ones by shunning people outside of the community 
---
Nope .. its not only for the ouside of the community. Its even aimed for the community. 
---
The whole Gw2 community is more of a cult these days then community. They claim one thing over and over again just based that it worked before. Not playing attention that it might changed long time ago.
---
but, are u absolutely sure how u feel about it tho?
---
Devs closed the Thread, so right now we have zero communication with them about it, guess it's a wait and see and go play other games while waiting.
---
Chrono has the usual mesmer blinks and whatnot - portal of course is huge, but herald (in shiro mostly, sw/sw) has a huge amount of mobility and evades: two targeted shadowsteps, a very powerful dodge ability, and some of the easiest access to superspeed in the game (literally a toggle).
---
PvE this point is moot, they're both survivable, but in pvp I wouldn't go calling chrono the more mobile of the two, at least during a fight
---
I'm kind of excited to do the living world story as they tend to be very interesting as well as rewarding. Regards to silverwaste i need to wrap my head around that as I was always a istan kinda guy. 
---
Thank you for the warm welcome, just got to wait for my friends to get lvl 80 so we can start exploring :)
---
Anet is famously bad at banning. The biggest "ba..suspension" was lats year for cheat software that was speed hacking and gear checking on the client side. ATM there is something like 40% of top 100 PvP roster occupied but strait up bots. On the day of the Colosseum update it was clear that every team every game have at least 1 bot (stuck in new terrain). PvE is plagued by same multibox bots for months...
---
And lets be clear software named is used by thousands of customers. There was massive outcry and support spam when the ban was for real cheating... with inevitable lift of suspension for most of cheaters. Even while this software officially (by the EULA) in the grey area, Anet would suicide the game if ban people for use of any of that addons.
---
Power Holo has quite a lot of CC in the form of knockbacks and knockdowns. It also has the ability to change to Scrapper for a couple of situations to use Sneak Gyro, as well as a little extra health depending on traits. You have Vulnerability uptime as well with [Steel-Packed Powder](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Steel-Packed_Powder) and a block with either Shield or [Photon Wall](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Photon_Wall)
---
Soulbeast also has comparable CC but, from personal experience, much higher burst from Sic'Em, which gives a damage buff when merged with your pet. You also have a damage buff when you CC, so you have it during that window where any non-breakbar enemy would be unable to answer. The biggest bonus however if to be able to slot out a skill for Spirits, which are fantastic at open world events.
---
Personally I feel Soulbeast is stronger statistically in open world content (Leaving out Fractals and Raids, which I can elaborate on if wanted) but Engineer is more fun and engaging to play if you use Rifle instead of Sword/Shield
---
Also, a side note, I'm talking about things while keeping the identity of the builds from [dT](https://staging.discretize.eu/) and [SC](https://snowcrows.com/). There is obviously more to the builds than these two provide. And that can make the difference if you know what to look for.
---
there are quite a lot of guilds you can join to go through the story and other events with.
---
Anet doesnt "allow" third party programs, its always use at your own risk.
---
Otherwise, Anet would have to allow every new update to these 3rd party programs individually to check, if they break ToS after new functions have been added.
---
"This time, *I'm* taking the credit. "
---
The general gist of SW is to go through the keeps in a certain order (**R**ed, **I**ndigo, **B**lue, **A**mber and tag mobs). Usually there's comms on LFG so you can just join them and follow them as you learn things.
---
Another one I never mentioned, but its a much more acquired taste, is the obvious TP flipping.
---
Waypoints outside an instance will warn you that the waypoint will take out outside, if you are not too hasty and click them once instead double-clicking.
---
They should disable waypoint double click in story instances so this doesn't happen.
---
They use reshade on their streams... They don't support addons, but they don't ban people for using them either, which is the main concern of people.
---
[Slapping](https://youtu.be/hHZvUeAdzeI) happens to be very powerful!
---
okay, what did i miss? who made a video?
---
Context?
---
Welcome to 2012.
---
&gt;Enjoy
---
Uhhh... Thanks?
---
If you don't like it don't play it.
---
yeah no.. how many of the gw1 skill did you actually use? always the same 20.. oh you want to build a ritu healer? here you go as N/Rt with 2 possible setups...
---
I love gw2 and I have to play very very much, but If Im not wrong comunitty of gw1 still big and strong no? Maybe I'll give a try, seems a very good game
---
Asmongold, the WoW streamer, is who I think was being referenced.
---
It is on the front page of this subreddit (Or at least was). Also can just youtube search "Asmongold GW2"
---
This post put all of my sentiments eloquently into words, so I just want to underline: both have great burst, but soulbeast has the biggest. Holo, however, adds loads more versatility, utility and interesting, varied gameplay. I think it is nice when things die with the use of two skills. It is nicer, however, if your gaming session utilizes slightly more than those two skills.
---
&gt;Unpopular Opinion
---
Well, at least you have something 100% accurate.
---
Yeah, I'd just rather spend that sort of mint on other stuff, haha.
---
&gt; To you 60g might not be a lot, but to someone that only plays 2 hours a day it's the world.
---
I usually don't even play for that long, but 60g is a few minutes of dailies each day for a month. Yes, this is a time-gate, but since it's essentially a present for the players, I am glad to take it. I didn't even count in the login rewards to that, which is probably another gold per day at least, on average.
---
However, I now get that what you expected from GW2 comes from GW1, a game I never played, and apparently a game in which progression was a lot faster, if it existed at all. Where I come from (other multiplayer online games), it is implied that you play a character (as in one (1), the number) and while playing, you develop it, and that this naturally takes time. Taking time is ok. "Grind" for me is doing the same thing over, and over, and over again, just to get, e.g., more of something. That is what makes a game just boring. I don't quite see that for most of the ascended stuff.
---
There is "grind", as I define it, in GW2, of course. That would be things like the material requirements for legendaries, both weapons and armor. Or think of that special apple. Those are beyond what I personally think is good for the game.
---
GoAFUS
---
I feel like there's more teamwork and synergy in GW1 on the lower levels of accessibility than in GW2.  In GW2 players are independent to a fault and it makes the game seem a lot more chaotic than it actually is in a small group with decent synergy.
---
Stream quality in game content, interact with your viewer's, run things in game, advertise what you do, but remember your roots, don't be a big headed arsehole. Unless of course you want to be famous for being one
---
It doesn't really matter what skills you get, what matters is what you do with them.  
---
If you need to find some obscure gimmick combination of skills that'll give you an undeserved advantage or grinding higher stats to feel like you have skills, you don't really have skill.  
---
Look at all the things revenats can do with their fixed sets of skills in their legends.
---
It's almost like they're different games entirely.
---
2 methods: 1 is significantly easier than the other
---
* become a part of the dev team, and make your presence known to the playersbase
---
* be as toxic as possible to everyone you come across in the game for no apparent reason whatsoever
---
Figure out which one is easier.
---
What does condition dps mean?
---
I have both lvl 80 ascended, and I raided, pvped and fractals, with engi you feel very versatile, with sb you can feel the insane dmg, and BTW one user said that engi can be scrapper on some situations, maybe must say also that ranger has also the choice of been druid, and very usefull on raids/fractals
---
They said that, for whatever reason, in-engine cutscenes are REALLY labor intensive. I agree with you that the pre-rendered ones are almost always terrible. Personally, I would rather have no cutscenes than have pre-rendered ones

As a point of reference.

This is what goes in my head around 1 AM in the morning
---
All of them. Each race has its own lore and peculiarities, and the personal story missions fit together like the pieces of a puzzle. 
---
Take "The Battle of Fort Trinity". During this story mission, you will use explosioves made by Tonn, recover an orb stolen from krait, and defeat a group of risen spies disguised with mesmer magic. 
---
Based on your choices at the end of "A Light in the Darkness", before The Battle of Fort Trinity you would have helped obtain Tonn's explosives, steal the krait orb, or discover the risen mesmer plot. So you'd know where they come from, which makes them more significant and memorable. They are jut just a thing that came out of nowhere anymore.
---
After playing the story several times with different choices, you see all the things that happened from different perspectives.
---
Step One: don't chose mesmer or necro class.
---
Step Two: do tutorial
---
Step three: go with lvl 2 pvp and metabattle top tier build of your role
---
Step four: get crazy and freak out shit talking about how unbalanced and broken are scourges and mirages
---
Step five: congrats, less 2 or 3 pvp proplayers you're famous for crying like the other 98% of pvpers(I'm in that 98% also XD)
---
If you click ok on the message, does it still let you use the tp? It just seems to be telling you that you meet both requirements for using the tp, so you should be able to use it once you click ok...
---
Piggybacking on the thread, but is it worth crafting the 22+ Slot bags?
---
That one was added in the [first big update last year](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Feedback:Game_updates/20180606), actually, along with some other graphics changes and chat log stuff. The gate to the northlands in pre was also changed to stay open long enough to enter solo in that update ~~but somehow I still haven't finished getting LDoA yet~~.
---
Awesome now I want that to be a mini, an animal in the game, pet for my druid or companion with legendary weapon.
---
Holds up quite well in most places actually.
---
Looks like HDR mode
---
Please have more 1 AM thoughts.
---
Ok. I need to watch this vid
---
Well I dont want to put effort in. I'm gonna say what I want, but I found a guild no worries
---
...are we pretending that best-in-slot skills are not a thing in every game ever? Including your precious GW1?
---
[Kinna like this huh?](https://i.imgur.com/CpQQvhD.png) (I'd kill my gold wallet for a ravenmander)
---
&gt; how much of HoT we didn't get in the end
---
? I thought everything in this video made it into the game in one form or another?
---
Great minds think alike.

The season 2 and 3 living world packs are on sale in the gemstore this week i think "Living World Season 2 Complete Pack—30% Off

well, that looks more like Pigeonmander. I prefer central image, even though its kinda looks like Blue Owl with furshoulders and body made of perfect darkness.. Sigh, stuff like this makes me soo happy.
---
Sure looks like it. I’d eat there!
---
6/7 meme, 8/7 with rice
---
Holy damn u triggered the carebear part of the community, a large portion indeed
---
Vista even, iirc. But now it's just one shortcut to bring it up even without alt tabbing or anything. Super handy!
---
Did you find a WvW guild for TC and/or TC's teamspeak and/or discord?  I would try that first before transferring.
---
I think soulbeast is better if your group is good, and holo is better if your group is modest or bad. Soulbeast has really good burst, then kind of needs cooldowns a bit. This works really well in CMfracs and raids, where things often have burst phases or breakbars that allow you to really pop cooldowns in small windows for massive dps. But, if your raid doesnt quickly burn phase into phase, youll be left outside your burst window and your dps will drop a good bit. Holo kind of just does its own rotation, so it doesnt really matter if stuff is in a burst phase or whatnot, itll just do damage consistently.
---
Yes, as I said, it is still very good, but there are better options. You can get a slb to drop spirits. A scourge healer, for instance, can keep scholar up a lot better than druid, and still doing a decent amount of damage. All I was saying is, if you want a optimal party, druid is not an good choice, no healer is.
---
That’s only if you choose that story mission during character creation. There are 2 other options
---
That account was only deleted because I wanted to change my username. It's not a bad link or spam or anything like that.
---
Yeah, he is always complaining in teamchat about "hackers" and "cheaters". I think it's a pretty big consensus among many of us that he got psychological problems.
---
Ah, okay. Thanks.
---
Unfortunately, your two main modes (open world and WvW) have *very* different build requirements, and there's next to *no* overlap between WvW builds and good Fractal/Raid builds. You can get away with playing in the open world with a damage-oriented zerg build or any roaming build (basically, anything in the WvW section except Support Firebrand and AH Frontliner), and that's what I'd suggest if you really want to use one set everywhere, but those builds are inherently going to have a lot less damage than your typical PvE builds, which will be a big hindrance if you foray into end-game content.
---
Rather than trying to find a good all-in-one build, my best suggestion is to get multiple sets of gear anyway. Focus on your WvW build, because gearing is a lot more important there than in PvE, but don't stress about Ascended armor. Sitting in mostly Exotics is fine, and you can get it for cheap on the TP or for free from your WvW reward tracks. Don't worry about making it an all-in-one build either. Make the build you want to play, and if it just doesn't work out well in PvE, buy a set of rare gear with the stats you want for a PvE build until you can afford to bump it up to exotics.
---
Side note: while working on your armor sets, also take a look at your options for getting Ascended trinkets for both PvE and WvW builds. They're generally cheaper or cost non-gold currencies, they account for way more of your stats than Ascended armor would, and they're just generally a better idea than focusing on anything else. Having Ascended trinkets and Exotic armor is like 95% as good as having full Ascended.
---
&gt; Well, in GW1 your class had 150 skills or so and you picked 8 out of that list, build diversity right there. 
---
So much diverstiy in good ranger bow builds.
---
* Wild Shot
---
* Distraction Shot
---
* Natural Stride
---
* Apply Poison
---
Fun fact, it takes literally 45-60mins if you buy the ore/logs and convert it to ingots and planks. You literally click make all and thats how long it takes. No moving, no nothing, just log in and probably spend your whole session watching combines. That is the worst thing about gen2 (and gen1 precursors, if you feel like wasting money).
---
So does this mean that skill is coded as if it were a melee ability?
---
His downvoted comment
---
And exactly this makes guild wars 2 fun, you can adapt to your enemies, in content x you are facing powerful melee attackers, you can take blinds, weakness and blocks
---
tg noname
---
Have you been outside during a full moon? It may be dark compared to day, but it's certainly pretty bright with your eyes adjusted.
---
Except in this case you can see blue in the sky, so it's not even that. It's just a cloudy day.
---
Florals? For Spring? 
---
Groundbreaking.
---
Try it out, let us know.
---
Send me a chak egg sac and I will give you free exposure.
---
TC is horrible im so glad we unlinked from them. They have inexperienced players that die within 2 seconds of engaging someone else. And they lose just about every zerg fight.
---
&gt; carapace/luminescent
---
was totally it sadly it the hat looks totally different on female characters :(
---
Wait the bank and the wardrobe tab only allows me to preview things I have unlocked right?
---
Any news on the new episode release date? I don't follow this game too closely but do play the episodes.
---
&gt; Playing with bots is not how GW1 is meant to be played.
---
I played it with bots for most of my time, and that was when there was some playerbase. the game works fine with bots, but any game gets better when played with friends
---
Joko appears at the last statue you saluted for and starts twerking in front of you with the spirit of Turai Ossa.
---
double the disappointment, we at least know that after layoffs there is more than 1 person working on WvW (most likely 2)
---
Sure the way you donate and (potentially) contribute to future content is by REAL MONEY converted for gemstore purchases.
---
I say potentially since they get to do whatever they want with the money and that means 99% pve/1%pvp/0%wvw
---
Sorry that’s the budget
---
Since there have been zero details published about it in over a year, I just assume it's canceled and won't be released because they don't have any sustainable idea how to make it better than it is right now.  
---
Now, I am just talking out of my ass here. But in my experience features that take that long, rarely get released.
---
Well, if you are not friendly, you'll be more 'infamous' than 'famous'.
---
They're still working on it guys. There's some issues with some backend stuff that they're trying to iron out atm.
---
Yeah, something like any typical map editor would be great.
---
On another hand, Halo's Forge Mode was pretty ideal with its design. Even more so with the precision controls added with Reach and so on.
---
It wouldn't be too ridiculous to turn players into a floating golem while they're in designer mode, so they can at least fly around and access areas with relative ease.
---
This was implemented beautifully on a console in 2007. We shouldn't have too many issues bringing it here.
---
Take your time and have fun with collections. If you decide to go crazy farming later you can but the most is recommend is parking alts in malchors leap to farm the elder wood nodes at the front of the map. 
---
Hope is an excellent weapon and I don't regret it at all! Though I do wonder how you will manage to use a pistol in wvw. I love wvw but as a zerger I've never found a use for pistol.
---
Do you have the expansions ? At least one on them. Without expansion, mastery points are locked behind a door which will open later. 
---
Also these points are rewarded only once. You don't need to replay the same story chapter to earn them again. And can't.
---
I don't know where you're getting your average of 6K or what conditions you're running.
---
But, just so you're aware, Power Soulbeast, played perfectly with realistic raid boons, benchmarks ~31K DPS on the golem.
---
Obviously in a solo open world scenario, or even in most raid/fractal scenarios, that won't be achievable. However, 6K is very, very low for a DPS class.
---
I'm only mentioning this because you say you have nothing to compare to. I can't truly comment on your build without trying it myself or at least seeing it in action, but, claiming 6K DPS is very far from a ton of DPS.
---
I wish I could share your optimism. I doubt we'll get much more than a bare bones form of alliances, with some rewards or bonus weekends to hype it. That's fine for me if its functional.
---
However, optimistically Itll take another 6 months to fine tune. Pessimistic is full abandonment of wvw if alliances crash and burn.
---
Since it wont address many of the core issues, such as skill, population and coverage differences, alliances wont be functional nor make a huge difference on release. 
---
People will tell me alliances will fix population imbalance, but they wont.
---
Yea, lest hope that they actually working on WvW re-balance and that why it takes so long WvW alliance update.
---
Otherwise be ready for people glitching air keep, 10 spellbreakers chain permacontesting rings of t3 keeps using warclaw and other fun exploits for the win.
---
His Twitter and other places have also referenced him as being Analytics before, so I imagine he's helping these bonus event folks gather the data they need to run the events.
---
In gw2 the teams of AI that let you completely AFK are your fellow players. Leeching all the way!
---
Can't really argue with that.
---
The guy is on the piken of NA. Trust me it's pretty bad. 
---
Frankly this thread seems like a very healthy reaction to realising your server has zero intention of competing with other players / servers and rather RP as victors regardless of reality.
---
Bots suck but they arent the reason the game is dead. The game is dead because anet straight up abandoned making any content whatsoever for it. Its really a shame too since elona never got its gw:beyond content and WiK/WoC is better content than any episode gw2 has gotten released.
---
Holosmith because Elementalist in general is kind of a jack of all trades with so many skills but no real bang in general.
---
Holosmith combines the straightforward aggressive Bruiser-warrior playstyle with the immense utility superiority offered by Engineer base class resulting in a very durable, self sustaining damage dealer which is hard to go down and is great for dishing out damage.
---
Elementalist, or Weaver in particular suffers from the single fact that it can't decide wtf it wants to be, and in trying to be everything, lacking one aspect be it Power Condi or Healing or Health or Toughness or Precision results in some subpar garbage damage, or yu just die immediately. 
---
These days people run FreshAir Weaver often because they try to cheese people and blow them up before they get aggro but it's really not that great when yu fight someone like a Thief or Mesmer which outmatches Weaver in mobility and evasive mechanics that yu just can't keep up with the pressure. 
---
Not to say it's not good for PvP, but usually Weaver players have little to no presence in a well matched PvP because they are all bunker heal and evade spammers which can't kill anything. 
---
Like hell if yu ever fight seen a Weaver fight any high sustain class but both are equally matched, the fight just doesn't end.
---
Wow, I just watched that Asmongold video (If that is what we're discussing).
---
I think the problem here is that this guy is just an egotistical douche and the GW2 game philosophy doesn't align with that. Not much more to it.
---
Oh, ok. I didn't realize the roleplay joke.
---
I wouldn't use that general rule honestly, it has led people to come up with their own rules on what is allowed or that they will only use "safe" features or in ways that don't give them an advantage, which I think is an issue going on with gw1 currently. Sticking to stuff that has been given an "ok" from someone at arenanet is the way to go, which those have had.
---
Jessica Price?
---
No they have a difference and a very staggering difference : Purity of Purpose.
---
Any random Condi thrown onto Scrapper has a chance to be cleansed and converted into a boon for the Scrapper to use.
---
Yu screw yurself twice as hard if yu throw it onto multiple people and he uses Purge Gyro to cleanse his entire party. 
---
Weaver kind of just washes it off but Scrapper turns yur condi spam into a boon steroid for himself with a couple of cleanses.
---
The first strip I actually like from this series. LOL
---
None of the guilds I've played with used TS for closed raids. I've only been on TS when it was open community-supported raids. To me, TS is very uncommon.
---
&gt; First - Is the game still very lively? When I go back to Guild Wars 1 it's a very condensed community hanging around in very specific areas. I remember Guild Wars 2 being pretty vibrant, but it's been about six years since I've played it. It's not a Ghost Town or anything, is it? That'd just make me sad.
---
It's not really a "ghost town", but activity, especially higher level players, is still more concentrated in higher level areas.
---
&gt; Second - How easy is it to find people to play OG dungeons with you? One of the big struggles I had the last time I tried to play Guild Wars 2 is that the initial "wave" of players had sort of passed and it was pretty difficult for me to find a team to beat any dungeons with. I really want to experience the original story and everything I've missed, I'm just wondering how much of a challenge that is.
---
There's usually some people on LFG. If not, you can put up your own LFG and those generally fill up pretty quickly.
---
&gt; Third - Is Roleplaying still very active? Is there a specific server I'd need to be on? Etc. I have very fond memories of the Guild Wars 2 Roleplaying server, but I know they've changed the way servers work a bit.
---
There are some RP guilds, but no dedicated "RP server" since the new system doesn't really work that way.
---
1. Yes. Game is still very active, especially in expansion zones.
---
2. As long as you’re not doing an obscure dungeon that nobody does anymore, dungeon parties are not too bad to fill up.  Just don’t be afraid to post on the LFG yourself!
---
3. Role playing is still a thing, but it’s usually just RP guilds now a days.  If you ask around Divinity’s Reach, there are plenty of active RP guilds that recruit there.
---
Kazo used to be community-friendly and willing to teach players who actually wants to improve. Dunno if they're still on AG, I haven't seen them since I moved to UW.
---
As a renegade main, go renegade
---
I once heard clipping errors and characters getting stuck in walls and alike would be a thing of the past 10 years ago. At this point I don't even care anymore..
---
Well my telling of the general rule is from my memory of the [policy](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/65547/policy-third-party-programs/)
---
&gt;We do not permit the use of any program that gives one player an unintended, unnatural, or unfair advantage over another player. This includes programs that alter game balance in favor of one player over another, automate actions within the game, promote unattended gameplay, or have an adverse effect on other players
---
As mentioned, there's a community Discord for AG: https://discord.me/agdiscord
---
Not entirely sure about that. I do believe the reference is from South Park though. The underpants gnomes episode.
---
Yeah but weaver has more mobility and is harder to actually push off of a node in a 1v1.
---
&gt; I figure if random bullshit can screw me, I have zero issue using random bullshit
---
This man ! This man! Have my upvote!
---
Hm. If you don't mind my asking - One of the things I really enjoyed in the initial release game was the sort of Map Events. Like, the Swamp monster in Kryta. I just remember large numbers of players getting involved in that.
---
Is that sort of thing still going strong? Or has it become more of a migratory thing? I mean, I do recall OG Guild Wars sort of being like that. A lot of empty areas where the story had sort of "Passed" and large numbers of players in the newest zones.
---
I am sad to hear that about RPing, though. I recall when I started RPing with some dude while we fought and another person walks past and says "So. You guys realize that X is the dedicated roleplay server, right?" Switched over to it. Lots of people constantly in character. Town areas that would be otherwise empty full of life.
---
Ah well. I suppose it will have to remain a fond memory. Thank you very much for your answers.
---
I can see more invisible walls being added :/
---
That's why we can't have nice things
---
Well ok then.
---
Not entirely true, exceptions are story dungeons... there you can usethe waypoint int the dungeon itself
---
not that good compared to other better options, but still good
---
I think it's such a no brainer question to the point mods should just close and delete question threads like this.
---
Gw2 isn't an "easy game" where yu can boost to max level immediately and jump into content without getting lost and slaughtered or both. 
---
New character? First character? New class? 
---
DON'T BOOST. DUH.
---
Thanks! Maybe I'll finally make a phone theme with these!
---
&gt; And yes, despite all that calculation it is a very lenient goal,...
---
So is GW1's BiS armor - a lenient goal that is not mandatory for anything. And yet it takes 2hrs vs X weeks in GW2. That's my problem. Give me full ascended in 2hrs in GW2 and I will shut up. But that's not going to happen because the people playing GW2 don't want it that way.
---
That is a lot of icons.
---
Anyone else remember 2012, when TC had a really strong wvw base?
---
There is no "we".
---
Never give up.
---
GW1 took 14 years to get a master volume slider.
---
Gonna have to disagree with basically this entire comment.
---
Dungeons are my all-time favorite thing in the game and I hate 99CM and 100CM because they are do far departed from dungeons and box you in to annoying arbitrary mechanics
---
I remember seeing a version of this LA theme were it was described as a computermade placeholder for when a proper orchestra had it done.
---
Mastery Points dont do anything until level 80
---
Join an active guild.  For sure not as good as it's golden days, but joining a guild actually made it really fun again.
---
&gt;(soon we wildstar 2.0)
---
Wildstar-style red AoE rings were probably the best thing that ever happened to making combat more readable in this game. The AoE circles we had at launch were barely even visible.
---
Tarnished coast is still probably your go-to as a rp server. The rp community has always been struggling with how.. unfriendly the world is for rpers (closed buildings, very few casual spaces in zones, limited emotes), but they have given us chairs and such now which is cool. Just still either concentrated to divinity's reach or guilds you'd have to seek out.
---
Yeah like in real life where you can't see shit at night unless you are close to those fires?
---
search "arenanet icons" under everything in wiki, has most nicely categorized
---
Sweet thanks was surprised the hate replies but don't care just keyboard warriors hahaha
---
&gt; Do this every three months and the meta will change
---
I think you're misunderstanding how that works, *and* how much players have pushed back on rapid change cycles in this game. Just go looking into the concerns posed about how frequently key classes like Chrono are adjusted and the impact of having to re-gear constantly, and you'll see how unpopular that idea is.
---
Most of these exact environments didn't (pretty much everything besides Verdant Brink parts). Sure, we got Tarir and other jungle parts but it always saddens me when I see those trailer-only parts of the jungle that I'd love to explore but never went live exactly as they were.
---
Is t this the dude that lives in absolute squalor?
---
&gt; because it would be easily fixable by the devs, 
---
fix what? The entire game which is not gw1?
---
Yeah here 150 skills with 85% useless, no thanks, tho they could do better with balance that's for sure
---
Oooo. Borb
---
1. Yeah you will consistently find people in all the maps. Some maps are less populated, but even there you find plenty of people and if you need help with some event, you can usually get people running by calling it out in map chat.
---
2. Very easy, TBH. Dungeons have gotten easier and power creep has made them easier as well. And several runes are meta/close to meta, therefore lots of people run them.
---
3. Servers are no longer really a thing. Megaservers mean people from multiple servers can play together. Your server/world tends to only matter for WvW. Plenty of peole RP in DR and Queensdale.
---
Let's say for the sake of argument that in gw2 there are only 3 skills to choose from and in gw1 50. At some point you find what works best in both games, but which system is more fun to you, the one where you only have 3 to choose from?  
---
It is perfectly fine if you find out after balance updates another good combination. Imagine you couldn't. It is an endless cycle which keeps players interested. If it doesn't matter what skills I take because everything is perfectly balanced then skills because cosmetical. Of course you are supposed to find out what works best for you. Just don't make it last forever. Don't give my the conspiracy crap.
---
That'd be a cool griffon skin for commanders
---
Portal people to the end of the daily jumping puzzle, the whole day, every day
---
Well most of it it simply felt at least in the beginning bad that I need to get an area and than clear all the golden hearts than past to the next and do the same thing again it felt kind of not good to me
---
Yeah well, GW2 has better graphics
---
Agreed, but I thought it was a neat trick.
---
why cant we just make these dye-able?
---
Or make things easy for yurself and just play from scratch. 
---
It's ludicrous to think a game wouldn't change after 5 years and that everything would be as slow as before, especially for lategame content.
---
GW2 appears to have depth, weapon swapping is 'supposed' to open up options, but cooldowns are designed such that weapon swapping is just part of a rotation. You feel majorly handicapped and wait around for cooldowns autoattacking if you try do play something thematic like a sword and shield warrior/guardian without swapping to another weapon. Everything in the end just feels up restricting, pigeon holes you into being stuck on a weapon just because you had to go through a rotation, or pigeon holed into having abilities on your extremely limited hotbars that you might not want just because they're tied to the weapon.
---
Even buffs and support stuff rather than being reactionary is just kept through uptime of a regular rotation. GW2 really missed out on interesting action combat. Everything should be reactionary based.
---
Also the immersion aspect of instant swaps to weapons that aren't even holstered on your character. Why is it that when we play BOTW, Witcher, Skyrim, RDR, etc... we want these immersive games where swapping weapons have real animations, your mounts are persistant creatures that you leave in places and call to you....but in MMOs everything has to be ridiculously instant, and your mount is just a speed buff thats summoned out of thin air. I hate it.
---
I watched his video where he discusses the value of having a stream persona that is separate from your actual self. And he brings up good, valuable points. I like who he is as him much more.    
---
I find it frustrating though, that even as he's describing the type of people that you are protecting yourself from by having a 'character' to play, he plays that character on his streams. So I have a better understanding of where he's coming from, but I disagree with his methods. He could have chosen to be *anyone* online, but he chose to portray, and perpetuate, an angry, overly critical, harsh, drama-llama personality.    
---
Thanks for pointing me towards his other channel :)
---
that link...
---
what is going on with that character?  did they make Heat Miser as an Asura?
---
The best use I have found for Lv80 tokens is the revenant, as it just "doesn't feel right" to me until higher levels.
---
Really? Can you share your preset?
---
I mean the gameplay did not suit me then but I like it now I have changed my view called growing as a person lol haha
---
You can skip all the hearts if you want, and just collect all the Waypoints/POIs/Vistas. Do any events that you feel like, as you come across them, as usually they will contribute to the nearest Renown Heart anyway.   
---
The only thing you'll really miss out on is the Gift of Exploration (or whatever it's called) from having 100% Central Tyria map completion, and that's only useful for Legendaries (which will be a long way away for you anyway).   
---
You don't even have to do any map completion if you don't want, level up through alternative means. WvW, sPvP, Dungeons, Story Missions, etc. Come back to do World Completion when you have unlocked the mounts through PoF.
---
I will do that a lot mention it online.
---
What I see: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Circle_of_Light
---
As others have mentioned, there are skills that give passive movement boosts, and the faster you are, generally, the faster you level. The wiki has lots of info about movement speed [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Movement_Speed)!
---
Several professions have a signet that gives a passive +25% speed boost. I would *highly* suggest keeping one on your skill bar while you level. These signets are:
---
Necro: Signet of the Locust
---
Ele: Signet of Air
---
Ranger: Signet of the Hunt
---
Thief: Signet of Shadows
---
Mesmer also has a signet (Signet of Inspiration) that gives you 5 seconds of swiftness (and another random boon) every 10 seconds. 
---
And, from looking at the wiki, there are several traits you can take that give you a very similar +25% speed boost under specific conditions (using melee weapons, attuned to air, health over 75%...). 
---
(oh, and a few random tips, if you haven't heard about them yet: you can search the wiki by using /wiki {whatever you want to search} in the in-game chat box (opens a window in your web browser), and you can link items, waypoints, points of interest, and a ton of other stuff in chat by shift-clicking whatever you want to link. You can also use this to search a specific item or location on the wiki! Oh, and /wiki wb gives you the world boss schedule; /wiki et gives you event timers for various areas in Tyria; and /wiki dnc gives you info about the day-night cycle.)
---
Ty great post helped a lot
---
Want!
---
&gt; One of the things I really enjoyed in the initial release game was the sort of Map Events. Like, the Swamp monster in Kryta.
---
Shadow Behemoth world boss; [there's going to be an event](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/weeklong-bonus-event-world-boss-beatdown/) that will boost up loot from that type of encounter between May 6th and 13th. You may wan to visit Sharemoor swamp and other world boss locations.
---
&gt; I am sad to hear that about RPing, though.
---
RPers are still here; there's this guild I saw few times who acts like Vigils squad force doing missions in maps.
---
Megaserver update made players of one region playing together and home world you've pick matters now only for WvW mode; RP folks may be occupying specific IP addresses and communicating thru guild - [you may want to join such](https://www.reddit.com/r/guildrecruitment/) if that's the stuff you liked back then. You can get map address from /ip command or have it permanently visible on loading screens with -maploadinfo argument added to game shortcut. There's also RP section in Looking For Group tool - Fountain of Rurikton on which you can also keep your eye on.
---
Well let me ask this. If you use the lvl 80 booster what will you do after that?
---
I see fairly little progress in balancing. What has been accomplished since pof? Balancing some HoT classes that were blatantly broken for 2-3 years for raids? Tuning down a few specs for PvP? That's great! 
---
But that's also about it. It literally takes them longer to adress the powercreep and inbalance they add than adding more random fluff that makes it worse.
---
"process and impacts of balancing" is rather hilarious considering how they first massively druid / warrior banners / ... to "promote diversity" only to years later realise their bandaid is the opposite of balance.
---
But with the megaservers, it doesn't really matter what server you're on, unless your RP group decides they're going to do RP in WvW. You just have to make sure you're all on NA or EU servers. 
---
Generally speaking, it seems like TC is a great server for WvW, but since it's so popular (I think it's currently full?) I kinda doubt you'd be able to transfer over.
---
Debating on the gem aura outfit it looks really good. But also considering getting an outfit not on the gemstore atm. Decisions decisions..
---
The "hard to balance" argument can't refute what I wrote. Fixed skills isn't great, hard to balance or not is irrelevant. This isn't about balance.
---
Looking for tanking builds for raiding
---
Saw a Firebrand Tank option in Snowcrow but no build yet, same with Chrono, Though is the metabattle build for chrono tank still valid?
---
sent :)
---
1. Nothing compared to gw1. Activity is everywhere, even on the population-wise weakest mode WvW. And even in T5, it's very active for such an old game. As far as other places goes, Spvp is populated, world bosses are populated, dungeons and raids are populated, some older maps also have people because they lvl up or do world map discovery etc. so on every map you can find people...Players who left this game for whatever reason tend to call this game dead, because they hate it and want to see this game die. Just make sure to double check it yourself first. 
---
2. I played way back then too. Dungeon got easier to find thanks to LFG, but since dungeons were dropped by the devs, it isn't as populated as back then. The newer dungeon "fractals" is the way to go now and is very active. If you like story and stuff, make sure to find a guild, it is much more enjoyable that way and they are able to reintroduce you to the game.
---
3. I don't roleplay so I can't answer this one.
---
Not really. Here is a list of 1336 different builds that were once used:
---
 [https://gwpvx.gamepedia.com/Category:All\_archived\_tested\_builds](https://gwpvx.gamepedia.com/Category:All_archived_tested_builds)

And here are the \~400 builds of the current "meta":

---
&gt; And if you simplify it to where it becomes easy to balance you’ll see a limit to build diversity as a result.
---
This statement isn't true. You can have well designed specs which are diverse but can be balanced just fine; and you can have non-diverse specs which can never be balanced.
---
I'll give deadeye as an example. The class can't be balanced for PvP and WvW in a healthy way. It's either going to destroy players low-end or it's going to be borderline useless due to counterplay. Similar to how kalista and azir were designs riot couldn't balance across their game. Just because their designs were bad to balance; doesn't mean there is no champ diversity. 
---
But truthfully believing balance can only exist if diversity doesn't means it's time for me to nope out. No point in having this discussion. 
---
But there are played plenty of games with far better balance than GW2 and plenty of diversity. In my experience, badly balanced games like GW2 kill their own diversity by having very few viable options unless you don't care about effectiveness; and in my experience people tend to care.
---
They are not working on that because it simply is not much you can do about it because people play on different times and have different ways of playing WvW. In fact at this point imo they should not do the alliances at all because that will kill the last of WvW because as Etheri said they do not adress any issues and will only bring the old with them and some new.
---
People might come back for a few weeks until they realize it is the same thing just now it is called worlds and people who played together before but will be spread out and players you did not want in your world will show up because of all of those players who are not in WvW guilds/alliances will be thrown in to each world and so it goes. 
---
They should drop the alliances until they can give us the alliances we really want and instead merge servers with to small population, let the players on it move to server or their choice, and then give us tournaments. All thise requires way less work then the alliances, in which they can work on for later so that when it comes it really solve issues not create new one.
---
ty :)
---
Chrono Tank will always be valid as it's got the highest evade/block mechanics. It's just been surpasses as meta in some encounters simply because you don't NEED that many evades/blocks. FBs provide more in terms of boons, utility, damage. This won't matter for most except the most serious min-maxers.    
---
The group comp was very recently updated, so expect the builds to be out within a week.
---
Stack all infusions in game. Place your self in LA and annoy the hell out of all people who have to use their sunglasses by standing next to you or log out because they cant stand it. There now you are famous.
---
I hope you realize it was a parody thread :P
---
It was meant to be garbage
---
The site says they're returning this week so they should be up soon.
---
This is so cute. She almost looks like a Bratz doll, only more badass.
---
1 spellbreaker contesting ring for 20 seconds against 80 people is pretty strait forward issue... exploit to some extent if abused properly.
---
Air keep that you can breach without any siege is pretty strait forward.
---
But there is other more important problem a in WvW: queues. During Warclaw week I was literally unable to play, because smallest queue at prime time was 1 hour for border without any action. Warclaw aside, you most likely would be unable to play 1 day of the week (reset) if you sneezed during reset and usually end up somewhere at 50-70 place. Merging servers only bring more strangers to the community who would not contribute to actual match.
---
At the moment any major update WvW aside server deletion is a joke for t1 servers because it strikes at people who play WvW as main gamemode bringing more players to the mix.
---
Most of serious WvW guilds were ready for Alliance update in the autumn... and well... it failed to become reality.
---
Ravemander immediately made me think of raves haha. But both ways, it would be awesome!
---
I think it's even more hated than Twilight Oasis. Lot of walking, lot of puzzles, and a boring and disappointing end boss. You don't even get to see the treasure room you're promised across the whole run!
---
It's funny how they nerfed many older fractals, like Cliffside, ruining a big part of their original appeal, just because they were too long, to then go and release fractals that are even longer than the originals they already nerfed.
---
i really want to run an axe/axe but idk where to get an offhand axe
---
Plan and simple, NO. Expect a fps,graphical and features hit. 
---
Keep reading if you want the low down and like to game under Linux despite it's quarks.
---
Subjective:  While being able to run and play gw2 in this way it performs amazing and gives another way to game under Linux.  I do feel people tend to leave out some glaring issues at least for me.  Running gw2 under wine/proton/lutris etc, creates subpar visuals/graphic.  HR textures for characters/weapons/armor are lacking.  LOD is lacking as well.  Imagine extreme lens blur (bokeh) at greater distance.  Micro shuttering/fps drops is also a problem, although can be reduced by turning off compositing.  But even in windos this is a problem with gw2.   Keeping fps above 60 you will be hard pressed even at times under optimal windows sessions,  it will be compounded under wine.  While minor i is a negative for me and others, no arcdps,tactical overlay,graphical overlay,mouse overlay, mount assist.  I haven't tried every app/tool out there under Linux, so others mileage may vary.  
---
Conclusion:  I spend the better part of the day in Linux and love it.  Login into gw and do a daily node farm rotation,mystic coin and daily and I'm out, weekends I login to windows and do some fractals and dungeons with friends.

The AB map artist wrote (official forums or artstation icr) that Tarir in all the pre-launch the trailers was a mock up for marketing because the actual game environment wasn't done yet.
---
i had this issue too, constantly. I tried different router settings, re-installing, etc. Nothing stopped it from happening.
---
Someone recommended to me to spam my auto attack button any time there was a change in the story... NPC dialogue, a cutscene, any kind of a transition in the story. I thought it sounded dumb. After killing the same boss 4 times in a season 2 episode and DCing every time it switched from his death to the NPC behaving badly, I tried it on the 5th attempty out of desperation.
---
It worked. 
---
I do it religiously now and haven't been disconnected once since I started. Obviously, there a chance it might not work for everyone, but I hope it helps you!
---
Huh, I thought it just told you about that stuff, not literally unlocked it.
---
Still works for ZMs. That's why I currently enjoy most in GW.
---
For legendary crafting, doing world cpletion and some World Bosses or SW will get you the experience required more easily than you think, and using a booster or a few will only expedite the process.
---
As for which legendary - I would probably say the sword, every class besides Necro uses them and looks wise both are fairly adaptable.
---
You can buy all the '1st gen' Precursors off the Market as well as craft them; 2nd Gen are all Account Bound, and must be crafted. Early 2nd Generation Legendaries (H.O.P.E., Astralaria, Nevermore, Chuka and Champawat) have "Journeys" that take you all over Tyria as part of their crafting process (as well as the material requirements). Later 2nd Gens did away with the story aspect, and have only the gold/mat dump to gain your weapon.
---
I just thought OP meant something more distinct/impactful like a giant above-ground mushroom forest, or underwater village.
---
Only thing that big which we know they cut was Malyck's tree.  But yeah, it was never featured in marketing materials either.
---
&gt; I'm well aware of these "other MMOs" that expected you to gradually develop "1 character". 
---
&gt; GW2 conforms far more to standard modern MMO archetypes. 
---
I wouldn't call the ones I meant modern. They didn't even had a graphical user interface. If anything, I would say GW1 might have been less of a role playing game than GW2 is.
---
&gt;Skill hunting was my personal favorite form of progression. A lot of the skills could be acquired by quests. 
---
That's the opposite from GW2 then. Obtaining the skills is quite easy.
---
[GvG discord](discord.gg/uyuPxCN)
---
You will find a lot of guilds there. There are some that will take you in i imagine, but don't be offended if most wont, because you are a noob.
---
Check recruitment channel.
---
Oh well, I'll just keep making my gold and they can keep making posts on how to
---
Earn the title (akin to GW2 achievements, iirc you can see them in the Hero panel) and then go to the Hall of Monuments, where you can display it. The points should then be associated with your joint GW1/GW2 account
---
All these designs are too busy and poorly readable in realistic application, IMO.
---
Yeah, for example sunrise needs about 90 mithrillium which you can only craft once a day per account. If you search on the wiki legendary weapons you will see there are two generations. The first gen legendaries cost around 1400g to make each and the second gen are 2000+g.
---
They require things like Deldrimor Steel Ingots, which are crafted using Lumps of Mithrillium.  You need to be max in a crafting profession (or 450 in some) to craft Lumps, and you can only craft them once per day.  This makes them timegated.  You can buy the Deldrimor Steel Ingots directly off the TP if you have extra gold and don't wish to wait.  Same for all timegated ascended materials.  
---
Other parts cannot be skipped as they are integral to the collection and not a purchasable material.  I made Astralaria which required the purchase of a whole list of materials from a specific NPC, but he would only sell you one book per day.  I think there were 7 in total, making it impossible to complete in any fewer than 7 days.  This is timegating.
---
Well, when you consider the various permutations and their interactions with other skills, then yes it does.  A condi soulbeast having access to bonfire, whirling axes, poison volley, crippling shot, and dagger auto in a single skillbar would be stupid strong, which is why they are on separate weapon sets so that they can be combined between the sets, but the skills can be balanced per weapon instead.
---
Iirc, GW1 doesn’t have traits but instead it has stat points.  If we dropped the trait system entirely then I’d lean to agree with you that we would need more skill access.  But given that traits are designed to interplay with skills to augment them in (sometimes arguable) meaningful ways, then the skills themselves need to be limited.
---
Copy on this.
---
I'm short about 12 mastery points from Central Tyria though. Will need to figure out where to find more points to pay for rank 3 and rank 4 of Legendary Crafting. I maxed out pact commander first because the itch to make a legendary is fairly recent.
---
Gw1 skill system was bloated.
---
Always getting around 4000 ping in WvW at peak times makes it unplayable for me, such a pain especially since i'm trying to get Warbringer :(
---
&gt; Instead, the grind in GW2 is for cosmetics, and skills.
---
(assuming you meant GW1 here): So, the grind was there, just not for armor, but skills? So, what you want is not no grind, but a different reward?
---
&gt; ...the developers already decided which skills we all going to use. Basically, here are your fixed skills and this is how will play the game, for the rest of your life...
---
Where are you getting this from? the only place you can stretch to make this argument is weapon skills because those are set per weapon and dont change (some thief and weaver weapon skills do). Also the devs dont decide what skills to use any more or less than any other game. They design it and put it into the game. After its in the game and in player hands its all on the community to form a meta, min/max, and figure out the broken combos that devs never saw coming (happens in every game). 
---
Maybe think of things in a slightly different way. You have 3 traitlines you can pick at lvl 80 right? thats sure 3 per trait line are taken by default but you still choose a traitline. So thats 18 traits (plus another 18 that can get swapped between where needed) 5 weapons skills with how ever many weapons the professions you are playing has. You have your choice from 1-6 heal skills (2 from elites) a butt load of utility choices (depending on your profession these can change you weapon skills) then another choice for elite skill. Oh and i almost forgot every profession has F1-4 skills which depending on your profession change with weapon choice, utility choice pet choice and can further change with elite spec choice. Im to lazy to get all the numbers and add them up for you, but i think can see my point. There are alot more choices in GW2 than you are acknowledging.
---
I guess depends what you call viable and what you consider a scepter build.
---
Elementalist is probably the most varied as scepter can be used to great effect for core Ele, Weaver and Tempest. Works in all game modes, but considered Niche for high end Fractals/Raids and only used in certain encounters.
---
Necro uses scepter for condi builds, here it really only works well as a Scourge, again is decent in all game modes, but again is Niche Fractals/Raids and used widely only in scenarios where large amounts of Ranged DPS are required.
---
Numerous guardian builds have scepter build into their rotation. Super strong builds, all game modes, meta for many raid encounters. But they are all builds that focus on another weapon and keep a scepter on swap for some portion of the rotation. Scepter is not the star in this case, that might make this less than ideal for showing off your legendary.
---
I loved the jumping puzzle parts, with the scaffolding and the tunnels.
---
If they wanted to make it last less, they should have made the fights easier, that's the boring and annoying part.
---
yea, but its not his fault that someone else used stolen cc. he got robbed and shouldnt be punished even more
---
I'm so glad I wasn't the only one who thought of that 🤣 10/10 fantastic
---
lets say the car was stolen directly from dealership (anet), do you think the dealership would ban him from purchasing a different car directly from them?
---
&gt;Later 2nd Gens did away with the story aspect, and have only the gold/mat dump to gain your weapon
---
that sucks. The journey was the most fun part of the process, IMHO
---
Thanks for the link to the Central Tyria stuff. I didn't even realize that was a thing. :)  
---
I intend to work more towards earning the griffon and then slowly re-earning the 100 gold I have to spend to get the last bits of stuff for the griffon. Hoping I can get the missing collection requirements done over the weekend. :D
---
That isnt arc's fault. It could lead to a ban if its a continued toxic behaviour but thats it.
---
&gt; Also i'd advice you to not rush your first legendary. You will feel burned out and wont enjoy your legendary then.
---
For the OP: take this advice seriously, it is a really good and important one!
---
I was just adding a supporting argument to your original objection. :)
---
I kinda assumed it would fall under the \`Copyright Exceptions for Archives\` by the \`ICA\`. However I'm not up for disputing legal issues. I've removed the archived files until further notice.
---
I play for the reward lips and the fun, not for my rank. 
---
So whoever I lose a bunch of MMR I just think 'great now I will get easier matches in the future' :)
---
Check [GW2 Efficiency](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator) if you want a cool breakdown of cost estimates for crafting legendaries (just type the name of a legendary into the box).
---
I'm not sure if this is true in today's economy, but at various times, for gen I legendaries, it has ended up cheaper to buy the precursor than to craft it.  If you go that route (or try to get it in the mystic forge) you don't need to worry about the mastery system at all; that's just for precursors for the gen I legendaries.
---
Otherwise, the GW2 wiki has a good breakdown of exactly what you need for each one.  The legendary is 3 gifts and a precursor; each gift may be made up of smaller gifts or other components, either crafted or in the mystic forge.
---
Every legendary (weapon) requires level 400 in at least two crafting professions, for two of the gifts.  Which profession each requires depends on the legendary.  Figure this out ahead of time, level 400 isn't likely too expensive these days but it is an added cost if you don't already have it.
---
Why is Armored Scale in the Accesory_icons folder? Is there a trinket with that icon? :O
---
It is nice, but if the picture was the blueprint for the doll, they messed up the nose. The face in the image has a lot more "character" than the one of the doll.
---
idk if you have inside info on this case but gold selling wasnt mentioned anywhere. another point is YOU are letting the bots farm gold in pvp making the gamemode awful to play and letting the gold sellers farm.
---
as for the gem codes, its not his fault the codes were stolen and he shouldnt be punished any more than taking the gems away.
---
Yeah, the griffon is way more important and fun than a legendary, tbh. Sounds like a good plan.
---
Also soon the last Gen 2 legendary will be out and there will be good videos on youtube showcasing each and every legendary. Just collect as much gold while enjoying the game. You can then decide which legendary you want to buy when you have enough gold and when you have had enough time to watch videos on youtube.
---
Owning the legendary shouldn't be the goal. Enjoying and *earning* the legendary is the actual goal.
---
Isn't this post around 6-7 years late?
---
Thanks! The picture was actually a surprise addition from the artist. They were sent an album of in-game references to work with. The doll's facial features kind of came with the Monster High doll that would best fit , I figure.
---
Agreed. And even then it's in the form of "better utilities for guild leaders and community managers" more than any sort of hope for gameplay or matchup improvement.
---
I'm not the person originally complaining about ascended armor, I was just clarifying how GW1 did things.  Personally though, I do prefer the GW1 loop; it's kinda similar to the Mastery System in GW2.  It was nice in GW1 to be able to easily have a character that was pretty much complete, and then be able to set your own goals, since nothing was gated off.  You still got a bit of vertical progression, since some skills were clearly better than others, but the emphasis on horizontal progression was really nice.  
---
An issue with a lot of multiplayer games with heavy vertical progression elements is that it's difficult to play with friends; you either have to roll an alt, or the lower-level player just has to be content with the higher level player curb-stomping everything for a while.  Modern games (including GW2) have attempted to rectify this via dynamic scaling, to varying degrees of success, but Guild Wars 1's approach is a lot more elegant, IMO.
---
Has this been resolved? What's your ISP?  
---
You may need to ask on the forums for additional help though. I'm from the Philippines and could play without issue on PLDT Fibr.
---
Like... posing... **ad infinitum**?
---
i'll see myself out.
---
It's pretty effective in pugs.  I'm not interested in speedrunning, so it works just fine for getting t4 dailies done.
---
For T4 Fractals, there are plenty of groups that will take any class. I played a Flamethrower Engi(Lower dps than Reaper), and no one kicked me. 
---
I don't know about Raids, but people kick me even if I brought a good class. The requirements requires experience than class choice.
---
then you should have put it in binary.
---
Now the joke falls flat.
---
Fell in love with the piano version when I first heard it years ago, tried to replicate it but never managed to.
---
Big f***ing upvote to you man, great job
---
Even then Anet won't do anything.
---
How do you do that?
---
It's fun
---
Honestly what you just described is my #1 pet peeve in Raids. If my pug fails no-greens-VG, no-updraft-Samarog, melee-Deimos or center-tank-Xera more than once, it's time to change it up. Once is a fluke, twice is a trend. Just go with the safer strat and take an addition 2 minutes on that encounter, instead of failing another pull at 5min in.
---
Maps frequently have multiple instances, which can be identified by their IP number. Typing /ip in chat will give you the IP number of your instance (e.g. 12.345.678.90). People will refer to these instances by the last part of that number (e.g. 90).
---
Usually when there’s a big meta event going on (e.g. Octovine in Auric Basin), only certain ones of those instances will have enough people / commanders to be successful. People will try to get into (“taxi into”) the organized maps via LFG, by joining the squad and then changing to their squadmates’ map instances. Assuming you’re on the same map but different instances, you can join a particular instance by rightclicking a squad member and selecting “Join in Auric Basin” or something similar.
---
Each instance of the map is hosted on a specific server IP. Each instance can have up to 100 (afaik) players, if it gets close to filling it opens another one up when people try to load in.
---
I can't speak for raids since i only play those very casually with friends, but for fractals I pug CMs every day and noone complains when theres a necro (or any other class).
---
Heck, the other day we had reaper, dh, and me as DD. dh and me were 1-2k away every fight. Reaper was 2-3 above whomever was winning...
---
The dps difference between DPS classes is not that much to begin with, and in a real scenario skill can make up for less theoretical damage.
---
Thank you so much! Kyle Landry's arrangement will always be my favorite and I was so stoked that I managed to be able to play it!
---
Who knows, because in gw1 you could pick any skill out of thousands, you don't have use the fixed ones on your weapons, so gw1 has more build diversity in general. But sure, one single gw2 build can be more diverse than one single gw1 build. If there would only be these two exact same builds , gw2 would "win".
---
What are people doing with their 2nd weekly supply drop? I have the stuff sitting in my inventory and have no idea what to do with it? :S
---
A ***properly built*** reaper is very strong in PvE now. I stress the "properly built" part, because there are tons of reapers running around with garbage builds that don't contribute anything. WvW reaper builds do not work in PvE because they are focused on survivability which is unnecessary in PvE with scripted enemies and healers.
---
If you follow the snowcrows build I'll link below, you'll do great damage, be invincible, and also bring high AoE damage to handle adds so they don't overwhelm your party.
---
**IMPORTANT: This build recently changed slightly.** For the second trait in the Reaper line, take Soul Eater (the damage boost) instead of Decimate Defenses (crit chance). The Soul Eater damage boost and self-healing are very strong and help Reapers a lot.
---

---
I played gw1 since factions preview weekend so... nope not new.
---
Also..
---
It has nothing to do with selling items earned through legitimate means (for cash or otherwise)
---
It’s about bots and botters which devalue the accomplishments of real players while also devaluing the material farms (since they farm 24/7 so they control over supply on markets WHICH in turn drives down the price of anything you legitimately farm) so bots drive down your potential profit on every single drop.
---
And in gw1 since they bot everything and every title now... there is truly nothing left of value (but possibly the story/lore if that’s what you’re into).
---
Take it from a person who played the game with thousands of real people... those bots that fill every instance aren’t real and will never breath “life” into the dead game.
---
So it has nothing at all to do with... people selling items went on the very 1st days of gw1 so that’s not new (it has everything to do with “how” they acquire them and how they are running 40+ accounts without fear of consequence)
---
Botters don’t care they can just start fresh.. Anet never set out to put in place ways to stop the script itself so they keep the working bots and constantly roll new accounts...
---
So sure go back and play like I said but remember what else I said... They even hacked and stole Gaile Gray mod account, so don’t act for one second like your “safe” out there.
---
For all it’s faults you are a hell of a lot safer in gw2
---
Plus holo is just so bad ass
---
That's because the guy in charge couldn't say no to anyone.
---
I recommend that you level your character. But, this choice is personally yours. 
---
If for any reason that you just want to use the boost to get to 80 despite everyone else saying you shouldn't, then it is perfectly fine. With level scaling, all zones, including ones that you are outleveled, will remain forever relevant. 
---
What can you do?
---
The first and main thing you can do is **Level up your mastery.** When you are level 80, you have a new exp bar called the [Mastery system](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mastery). The primary purpose of the mastery is that You unlock abilities such as auto-loot. You can level it up with exp and it is account-wide. What you also need to know is that you have to go out and find [mastery points](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mastery#Mastery_points), which is what you will need in order to progress further for mastery. You can find the location of where to get mastery points by looking through your achievements, which is done by pressing H -&gt; clicking on achievement tab -&gt; Looking for the red dots that look like [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/thumb/b/b7/Mastery_point_%28Central_Tyria%29.png/20px-Mastery_point_%28Central_Tyria%29.png). 
---
You can level up your mastery by getting experience. This can be done through:
---
* Exploring the world. If you are lost, just hold W, and see where you end up.
---
* Do every random events you find.
---
* Do Map completion such as finishing hearts, finding vistas and PoI, do the Hero point challenges.
---
* Do Dungeons.
---
* Kill everything you see.
---
* Mine/chop/gather everything you see.  
---
* Completing the personal storyline.

Basically, the mastery system is the leveling system that you missed out by boosting.
---
If they had released it when they told us about it then maybe it would have worked until we realized that it does not change a thing. The only thing that do change is servers are worlds.
---
As for merging, well that happens every 2 months anyway, but in this case you give the person a choice to move to any of the servers left. And tournaments would give us something to do. 
---
Queues in WvW will always be a thing. There is not really much we can do about it because we have population and should be happy about that. I also get stuck in queue sometimes and especially on reset when queue bugs out which is does pretty much every reset and it is a lottery who gets in and who do not. But even so i prefer this rather then having no people in WvW.
---
And alliances wont change this. Because again, you can decide about your guild and your alliance. You can add or kick people out of it. But a good pile of WvW players are not in a WvW guild or in a alliance and those will be placed out each period. This means that you will still have queue to the borders because those people will still pile up on your world. I mean it is not like arena net will shut them out :) 
---
So we already doing this today with links, nothing will change really except that they can make this happen much faster. And we get tornaments in to the game and if lucky they might even do something guild related with that. Like a leader board (i can still dream) and people will come back because this is something positive. The only thing A-Net need to remember is to not only have a few weeks between the tornaments so that players can recover.
---
That was extremely silly and rude of this person considering the mobs die in like 2-5 hits and I legit have not bothered timing the kills since forever as when I do it we just storm in and pick the 1st mob that's not already attacked.
---
So communication is important in most cases but in this very specific scenario that person sounded like an ass and I'm not sure any amount of communication would have solved it. Since the timer is very flexible and the person was very much alone in their desire to kill with a perfect timing you could have ignored them and just went on to kill the other mobs, nothing's stopping you :p
---
Yes, Reaper is good, especially in Fractals. Don't just look at benchmarks or Snow Crows' raid viability scores to judge how good something is. 
---
Something that people tend to ignore about Reaper is their tankiness, which allows them to face tank attacks that other people would have to dodge. That's especially noticeable in Fractals with instabs like We Bleed Fire, where everyone will be dodging to avoid the burst from that attack, while the reaper can face tank it most of the time. Reaper can also get easy on-demand stability from their Shroud 3 skill, which can allow them to further shrug off attacks and continue wailing on things. 
---
Reaper also has very good burst in an AoE. It's similar to power Berserker who also has a bad benchmark. The AoE cleave is extremely underrated, and that's not something you'll ever be able to appreciate when you're just looking at benchmarks made against an immobile, non-attack testing golem. 
---
I personally see Reapers get ton damage often when I do my daily T4s, so please don't be discouraged to play it.
---
That statement does not cover being an asshole. If it did many things would be disallowed.
---
If you or anyone's interested, here's a demo reel of mockup HoT environments that never went live. Amazing stuff.

---
Hearts are really quick to clear.
---
* **Melandru**: The density of Orrian gorillas are pretty high.  Dagger Storm easily tags and destroys a crowd of them.
---
* **Grenth**: You can use [Ley Organs](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ley_Organ) skill 3 to [Reclaim](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reclaim) wraiths, both hostile and allied ones.
---
* **Dwayna**: Use the artifacts to clear 5 corrupted clouds to clear
---
* **Balthazar** &amp; **Lyssa**: Use the Ley Organ skill 4, [Transfer Magic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Transfer_Magic).  The farther the orby guy goes, the more the heart fills up.
---
The meta also helps fill up the hearts too.
---
You need to be 80 to access LS story (Tangled Paths) and maps (BSF &amp; SR).  Being 80 also helps make the run easier and I have a set of ascended weapons and trinkets.  I use either character level rewards as gear or exotics that I gotten thru map clears.
---
Dunno a single class to join all groups would be Guardian since you have a burst Condition DPS spec as Firebrand, a burst Power DPS with Dragonhunter, a Supporter with Quickbrand and have even access to Healbrand.
---
If you're looking for a Puzzle piece to bend into most Situations it'd be Guardian.
---
Maybe just work racist/homophobic slurs out of your vocabulary? It'll help you out of game too, unless you like to hang out with that kind of person
---
Yeah I haven't picked them yet, too many choices LOL. I will probably check dulfy's site for the full gallery (if she has them) in order to make the decision.
---
You need to be level 80 to access the LS episode (Tangle Paths) and maps (BSF &amp; SR).  Being level 80 also helps with clearing mobs, having traits &amp; skills, and access to ascended gear (I have a set of weapons and trinkets).  I used either character reward gear or exotics from previous map clears.
---
Map clears have, IIRC, a 20% chance to reward a key.
---
Nice link, thanks!
---
You've got to hate fractals. Cliffside with its bullshit "puzzles", Uncategorized with its rooms, snowblind and all of its waiting and corridor running for no reason, Underground, the new Molten Boss, Solid Ocean has got to drive you mad, Aetherblade is torture, and so on, and so forth.
---
Now tell me that you do your daily T4s.
---
You can also store it in bank and not risk with tp.
---
Whilst i agree with you what you say about how it was i don't think Arena Net can solve this at this point. Why i think this is because in EU we have pretty much already taken over how we want WvW to be for the server we are on. We don't have full control but never the less we decide how we want WvW to be by having movements when a server gets to over crowded or some super drama happen or what ever reason i don't really care what it is, my point is that we are doing it today. In the past we did not really do it. Guilds moved at points but server pride was more of a thing and you stayed with your server, you worked with your guilds, your roamers, your scouts, people came to save shit bla bla bla. Today that is not gone on all servers but on many and we have changed the way of thinking. 
---
And with that i belive that there is nothing Arena Net can do. Because we the players will go on doing what we do now because this is what WvW grew to be. It wont change with alliances we are both agreeing on this in the past at least. And tbh it can not be that we take over full control. Because so many players are not in a WvW guild or not even interested in being in one. New players have no idea what this means and so on so a large pile of players will stand without a world and tossing them on a shitpile world noone wants will not create a healthy WvW. It just feels it is too late. But then again what can we do if not alliances. And that is why i belive merging servers and give us tournaments with reasons to win and reason for guilds to fight in it and maybe as you said stop players from swapping every week. I have no clue really i just reached a point were i feel alliances will hurt WvW more in the shape it is said it will come out.
---
What? Game development doesn't all happen in the month before release? Then what's all the crunch for?!
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/September_2014_Feature_Pack#New_Player_Experience
---
Wasn't quite the dodging, but downed state and weapon swapping etc... couple of things they "level-gated" to aid new players who otherwise might feel overwhelmed.
---
There is also the other half of the problem. Too many people are all too willing to be the audience for the attention seeking asshole.
---
But... there's no risk? Really old buy orders don't get deleted, after all...
---
If you have the log of that KC I'd be curious to see it : ) I've never seen what a Reaper can do on KC. I'd love to compare to a pro Reaper.
---
Yeah I meant Gorse. If the Pug can't execute the riskier but more advanced strats then the group should fall back to the safer way. There's no change in the reward, so spending 2 min more in safer pull compared to trying and failing the advanced strat is well worth it.
---
That's a good system!
---
Pve it’s fine pvp it’s ok wvw it’s shit unless ur roaming
---
store it in the bank? what year is this, 2013? if you are referring to guild banks, surprisingly not everyone has one, and they are quite restrictive for this matter.
---
You can? I know you can store gold in the guild bank, I didn't realize you can do it with the personal one.
---
my bf told me to post my logs here and im very obedient:

Honestly it sounds like your ISP or an intermediary (e.g. Campus Network admin) is throttling your connection. You can try using a command line argument to use a different port as a [workaround] (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments), or you could just leave the VPN on while playing.
---
Alternatively it could be a network adapter issue where it's turning off to save power. In which case you could check your PC's power settings.
---
I don't like the buying bag space in general because it changes game design to include more loot than needed. But, still a good deal for 4 characters (iirc) and bag upgrades via in game gold purchases.
---
Bruh, spending $14 real dollars on something in game is worth the 30 seconds it takes to ALT+TAB out of the game and look it up on a website.
---
But yeah, sure, it's ANet's fault because  they're trying to make it hard for you to spend money.  Let's go with that.
---
Yeah honestly gathering 10 people to help you run the reclamation  mission for the GH is probably the most annoying part.
---
And my own motivation was simply due to the lack of Housing i wanted to make the GH my own housing... I have sloooooowly managed to level some stuff buit alone ill probably never complete it.
---
Someday though. (i have taken  biiig breaks from working on it though)
---
&gt; You run a specific build and swap out 1-3 skills for some specific situations and that's mostly it.
---
With templates it doesn't even have to be that specific ...
---
Use this template for this mission.
---
Use that template for the other missions.
---
Mm. It was always concentrated in DR, I don't mind that so much. Though I did occasionally meet people out in the maps.
---
As someone who mains a Mirage, I always feel like my boons are my biggest give away. I always felt it is the easiest way to tell especially if they have guild banner boosters .
---
I pray they bring player housing in season 5 or the next expansion. I feel like they were dipping their toes in the water with the sun spear sanctuary, and I want them to go full force with it because it's such an mmo mainstay.
---
yeh in everyone welcome you don't bitch about dps, it clearly isn't the main goal there. It's to have fun and finish ur dailies, I know those groups aren't for me so I avoid them. But now I agree the guy that started about dps was a jerk and prolly isn't good enough for tryhard groups so gets joy of doing this.

Fashion is all.  Nothing else matters if you leave a good-looking corpse 😁
---
If you dont like particular little quests on the maps (golden hearts) dont do them, but do keep in mind - some of them offer useful things and there is reasons to complete all maps at least one time.
---
Dont pick up thougness/vitality gear if you planning to do some solo map completions. It will slow you down in most cases. 
---
HoT and PoF content quite hard compared to Core Tyria. 
---
Pay attention to this subreddit, 99% of important news will be here minutes after official site (or even before official announcement).

https://gw2efficiency.com/ - very useful resource
---
http://dulfy.net/ and this.
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki for builds, although there is alternatives like snowcrows site.
---
Race has no gameplay impact, all professions can survive alone, dodging [default key is V] is the best way to avoid damage and the story starts at lvl 10.
---
 
---
Enjoy the game.
---
Don't stashes have a weekly withdraw limit?
---
Check out these links to start with and see if you find something interesting: https://old.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/newplayers
---
I personally found them useful back when I was new. 
---
On the more direct note: when you play on your first map just go around and do whatever catches your fancy. There'll be events sometimes marked by orange symbols of different sorts: Shields tend to be an NPC that needs protecting, crossed swords means enemies and circles mean a large area with stuff going on in. These events are a lot more fun and dynamic than going between hearts to do the quest there. 
---
If you picked say a Norn as your race you'll start in the Norns racial area. But all racial starting zone waypoints (a way to teleport between maps) will be available to you. So you can do the Norn starting area first, then move on to the Sylvari one. Just waypoint around and explore!
---
Ahhhh, the catastrophic risk of getting a 10g liquid aurillium...
---
No it's not Arc's fault.  It's also not Logitech's fault if someone decides to macro their entire DPS rotation to one key.  However, "logitech is an approved keyboard!" doesnt mean you haven't used the keyboard to break the rules.
---
ArcDPS is a tool.  People aren't being blanket-banned for using it, nor should be.  But it doesn't mean the tool can't be misused and lead to a ban.
---
All I'm saying is use your tools responsibly.
---
I've been working on improving the number. I'm currently in mostly exotics, with Ascended trinkets and rings. But yeah, I don't plan on raiding any time soon (I play mostly with just a handful of friends), and I'm not too worried about being top-meta.
---
I'll probably post my full build later, to get some basic advice, and find out where I'm falling short DPS-wise.
---
- There are no racial traits. 
---
- There are racial active skills that you know from the beginning; however the class skills are stronger, and you can only have 1 healing skill, 3 utility skills and one ultimate skill, so taking a class skill for each is best.
---
- Each race allows for 3 different beginnings of your "personal story" (the main story arc in the base game); later all stories continue the same
---
- The looks of armor and colors depend on your race
---
- Theres 3 sets of "racial armor" that can only be worn by the corresponding race
---
The personal story is not great in gameplay imo; it is mainly for the story. 
---
There are no typical quests but Renown Hearts (where you help an area) and events that are limited in time but will repeat after some waiting (and doing precursor events). Both  range from "kill bandits" over "help out the farm" - so you have variety in style. And for most renown hearts, there are different tasks available.
---
The lore: To get the whole deal in lore, you should play the racial part of the personal story for each race; afterwards theres three fractions where you can join one. Use many characters!
---
Exploration is the same for all; there are no regions that are restricted for races.
---
Holo if you can pay attention to what is going on. You can easily kill yourself if you overheat, as it does a lot of damage.
---
I forgot to mention, I'm only experiencing this issue with this game. no other client or game has this problem for me. I'll try what you said, thanks.
---
&gt;  The entire point of meta-compositions like FB-Ren is to maximize DPS w/ minimal CC or utility  
---
Play with LFG parties then, like I do. I rarely get the same group comp, let alone the utilities. And most of the time can complete them with no problems.
---
&gt;And what sense does a huge number of skills do to the players if they can't get a decent balance with them?
---
Ask the path of exile guys that, crapload of skills everything overpowered and yet great gameplay. How does a low number of skills create balance and great diversity? But sure for PvP balance matters, in PvE I don't give a crap, can't buy a cookie with balance, I'm not looking for balance, I want to create unique builds.
---
Haha yess you are!! \o/ big thanks for that! &lt;3 after that i realized there’s many people who don’t know about it. So this is my contribution to this community :3
---
Hey Chelsea, feel free to come back and answer this after exordioms released with the next update, but what was the overall arching theme for the weapon? It seems like Crystal or glass played a part but i'm actually more interested in the creative process that happened to make this come to fruition.
---
"RP server" tends to be Tarnished Coast. You can switch "worlds" (servers) on login screen of the game. Most people RP in Divinity's Reach (in Kryta) by the human starting area. 
---
To use waypoints you press M for map and then rapid double click on the one you want. When I was new I was used to ESO's waypoints where you had to walk up to them... Doesn't work here haha
---
For pve: DH is super, super strong atm and uses it. DPS firebrand also uses it (although not much). Condi scourge and condi reaper both use it and are okay, scourge is better and it uses it more so woo. There's a passable power tempest build that uses it, and condi mirage build that uses it (although the axe build is superior in *most* situations, it's still quite good).
---
Yeah. I think it's 300g.
---
i mean cant you use the photonic blasting module perk to counteract that
---
The skill system is better, items are garbage and lvl cap is a joke. That's why we wanted higher lvl cap and better itemisation for gw2. What we didn't want is fixed skills on weapons.
---
Those are buy offers. None of that will get bought for so little, of it did, it would mean it has become much cheaper.
---
I do something similar. Whenever there's something I like, I set a buy offer for as little as possible as a reminder usually around 1 silver or so. Then another to store gold for it.
---
Yeah, I hear ya.  Good luck with your runs and key drops!
---
Shining blade backpiece would be sooooo cool if it weren’t bright blue and gold.
---
Well, isaiah cartwright already decided the most of my skills on those weapons. So perhaps he can play my chara while I'm playing poe.
---
Wings may not be dyeable just like the color eye mask set.
---
Reaper has gotten better by staying the same. It's problem was always good but not great DPS, no real party buffs.
---
Now the game has been balanced so that dedicated DPS builds can only do elite DPS if they sacrifice part/all of their support. This has made reaper more viable despite the fact that it hasn't really changed all that much.
---
A better solution for the clueless player issue would be having some sort of template/build loadout system and providing some reasonable default or maybe a set of defaults aimed at various archetypes. They don't need to be optimal but it would be better than the mess people can get themselves into. Those who want to chart their own course can ignore it. Basically like how it is for sPvP right now.
---
Not really 150 either. Some are exact duplicates. While other might be mostly duplicates with reduced mana cost and/or reduced recharge time.
---
If only you had multiple weapons, utility skills, and elite specs to choose from.
---
Feel free to message me specifically if you'd like :) I'm no pro but I'd like to think I can give some pointers
---
Starts scaling at 6 people, it has always been easier to take 5 or less people.
---
im in good sir :)
---
Eh? There are a lot of other things with similarly high demand and higher profit than destroyer lodestones. Such as iron and platinum.
---
Thief is very forgiving with its rotation. Rotation that usually is fairly simple, it's very quick to correct mistakes and get your dps back to speed in a couple of key presses.
---
I do remember some skills being locked when I started new characters until I reached a certain level, I guess the other stuff was unlocked by account max level. They added little dodging tutorials in the starter zones around the same time, so I get the confusion.
---
The risk is that through some stroke of madness, Anet decides to let LA drop more commonly and the price falls to &lt;100g or something.
---
I know people who invested in some weapons a while ago that absolutely plummeted in one update or another.
---
For instance, do Zoom: All on [this](http://www.gw2spidy.com/item/48726) item.
---
Awesome thanks, I'll get started on it!
---
Wow. Talk about low-effort trolling. Pathetic.
---
human t3 chest and pants with bladed boots
---
you missed the most important resource of all - the wiki. having played a bit of FFXIV recently I wish they had any kind of wiki even half as good as ours here.
---
you can always type /wiki in the chatbox to open it in your browser. if you add a space after and shift-click any skill, or item or trait it takes you to its page (it should look like "/wiki [Banana]" for example).
---
while dulfy will have guides up sooner for new content, the wiki has them for pretty much everything after a few days as well, and especially for older content its way better, since dulfy rarely updates old guides with new information, while the wiki constantly gets updated.
---
&gt; when all else fails he basically says you're wrong and I'm right 
---
I never did that. Are YOU trolling? Because you are using strawman arguments to avoid addressing any arguments. Fixed skills are in fact a fact and now show me that circular logic.
---
I redid my s/d ele gear and really liked the black onyx sword so I grabbed that, other than that I have no clue too.

---
Did you clear the story instance once before doing it?
---
You do this monthly? my friend doesnt meet the reqs but we could try to get him there by next month
---
Screenshot of your gw2 folder might be of help.
---
its kinda obvious, albeit, I expect someone mention it anyway so I saved a bit of my time.
---
Of course it didnt work quite well.
---
Build it right and use it right. I have a negative attitude to other necros because theyll use staff which is pure trash or sit there autoing with axe.
---
For harder content like cms no i wouldnt use reaper. Shroud stops you from being healed if you eat a mechanic.
---
blasting module is used almost exclusively in raids, as it locks you out of photon forge for longer making it not ideal for open world
---
What do you recommend doing all the hearts no matter what
---
Would love to join, but alas, I am one of th EU people.  
---
Does anybody know if there is a similar community event for the EU?
---
Excellent performance! This is the piece that inspired me to play piano myself. Do you have the sheet music to share?
---
Scourge. Just use skills off cd.
---
If you're spec'd properly, you'll do far more than daredevil that others are suggesting...and be more tanky (so you won't insta down from getting sneezed on).
---
Most recommend thief.
---
It is fine to start out with.
---
But Dragonhunter (guardian) would probably be a better choice.
---
It may be a bit harder than daredevil but is still relatively easy.
---
You bring more utility and a lot more cleave damage.
---
In some fractals there are a lot of mobs than you want to "cleave" down while you kill the boss or whatever. And daredevil is kind of lacking there.
---
If you ever decide to try out cm's you will also have a better time than with daredevil.
---
So yea. I would strongly recommend Dragonhunter for fractals. It's also one of the meta builds at the moment. 
---
If you need to look up a guide for the build. 
---
You could head to discretize.eu or snowcrows.com 
---
Snowcrows homepage favors raids and discretize fractals 
---
That would be my opinion. But most importantly choose which seems to be more fun to you
---
People say trolls is hard without mounts, pfft I speedrun that shit. It's just long. Lots of fun
---
Sorry can you re-word that, don't know what you mean.
---
I think TP is broken, cause I haven't been able to use the gem exchange or purchase gems for days...
---
this has been among my favorite songs since i first heard it in 2012. 10/10, thank you
---
No refund/extra things to redeem. Your game is the same as it was when you purchased it. You just can't do expansion things.
---
F2P comes with a bunch of restrictions, like no tp, no whispering ppl, no map chat ect. The wiki can show you all of the restrictions.
---
Expansions give you more content in the form of new maps, story, raids, specializations ect
---
Don't rush to reach level 80 and gear out your character in ascended equipment.  Also don't rush through the story or the world in general--take time to explore, get lost, stumble into things/events, and befriend other new players (there are lots of newb friendly guilds) so you can experience things together.  The game was designed to not be super grindy, and it can be enjoyed at all levels.
---
even for roaming it struggles quite a lot
---
that was quick. Announce an event and a few days later its already cancelled RIP. Not really a great start to these new events. Why even say anything if there was even a possibility it might not work?
---
I remember the day they changed the drop rates in aether path I made a lot of money that day :D
---
Honestly. Thanks.
---
I spent waaaaay too long in sandswept isles and in vabbi for just achievements and elite specilization collections and stuff. I checked wiki/dulfy/google what have you and found nothing. So even though I might not have as much use for it (unless something pops up) I thank you, this will save someone a headache!
---
Got it. So I'm basically a normal paid player. Thank you for the response. Two expansions to purchase then?
---
The short version is purchasing the base game before it went free to play meant you could play the base game before it went free to play in 2015.
---
Free accounts have some restrictions you don't have. 
---
Expansion content is usually pretty busy, but that doesn't mean Core Tyria content is abandoned. The base game is still active and busy. 
---
Expansion content access costs extra for everyone (although often discounted by 30-50%). Check for offers if you go back into the game and enjoy it. 
---
Living Story (season 2 onwards) content is unlocked for free if you log in during the release window or during a giveaway, but is then paid for using gems if you miss it, which you can buy for cash or get in-game. They're been quite generous with LS4, offering repeated opportunities to get it for free and if you get into gold and achievement farming, you can unlock it without spending a penny. 
---
After Season 1, they moved to a "unlock it once, get it forever" model, so it works like an extension of the personal story more than permanently inaccessible mega events. 
---
To play LS3 you need Heart of Thorns and to play LS4 you need Path of Fire. 
---
The expansions are worth paying for. The Living Story content varies, but is generally worth your time. Each season is basically a mini-expansion.

If I buy the expansion to play the new profession, can I level with my f2p friend?

Anet has specifically stated all new maps will be in Tyria, not the Mists.
---
Thank you!Better view of cat -&gt; https://i.imgur.com/9oYgCGr.jpg
---
You're meaning Revenant? You totally can!
---
EDIT: The main differences will appear once you both reach level 80 - you'll have access to the Elite Specialisations, new maps, and extra story.
---
Uh ... how is loading up a predefined template making your own build? That is the complete opposite of making your own build.
---
I was wondering too! :)
---
The OP does have a point, to a degree.  
---
A common complaint with GW2 is that weapon skills aren’t customisable in the same way utility skills are.  To change your weapon skills, you have to change what weapon is equipped which changes your entire rotation.  One of the main reasons why Elite Specialisations are so popular is they provide classes with more weapon skills and more utility skills.  More skills equals more strategic options and that’s the crux of the issue here.  
---
Personally I think a lot of the issues with GW2 can be traced back to the “Colin Era” of GW2.  There are a lot of very interesting ideas and mechanics that occurred during the “Colin Era”.  Unfortunately a lot of these ideas and mechanics suffer from a lack of polish (e.g. the crafting system).  These issues are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things and they are easily fixable.  In all honesty, these issues would have probably been fixed years ago had ANET not invested a significant chunk of their development resources on projects unrelated to GW2.  
---
Lastly there’s no harm in preferring GW1 over GW2 or vice versa.  Personally I think there are a lot of interesting ideas in GW1 that could be migrated over to GW2 as part of a future update.  Personally I feel like GW2 is yet to realise its full potential.  I think masteries were a step in the right direction.  The developers now need to deliver “the next big thing” for GW2.
---
The cat tax has been met
---
&gt;Now, I was hoping someone could give me some insight into whether or not an Engineer with 500 Weaponsmithing can craft a Legendary that he can't wield...
---
Yes. Most of legendary weapon crafting is done via the Mystic Forge, and none of it is soulbound (just account bound at most).
---
&gt;An additional issue is that I don't quite understand the long, convoluted process it takes to make a legendary... and it's a little daunting to undertake without having a better understanding of how to acquire the needed items since different legendaries appear to require different things?
---
The process differs whether you're doing Gen1 or Gen2 (and which of the Gen2). But overall it's not \*that\* convoluted (though it may seem so at first glance). It's largely a lot of material farming for the most part, with mapping, some WvW, and obtaining the precursor (method varies on generation).
---
It'd be easier to consider what the process is when you nailed down which legendary you want. But effectively you're going after four items:
---
* Generation-specific mapping Gift
---
* Generation-specific material Gift (varies per crafting profession)
---
* Precursor
---
* Legendary-specific Gift
---
If you nail down which generation you're going for, you can work on two of the gifts while figuring out whether you want a sword or greatsword.
---
&gt;For instance, I think not having max Legendary crafting locks me out of Gen 2 versions of the items, is that correct? 
---
Technically true, however, the process is long enough that you may be able to finish tier 4 of that mastery line before getting to the point you really need it. The mastery really only prevents process on precursor crafting, so there's three items you can work on while farming experience.
---
Each expansion is $30, the official pack reduces the cost of both to $50 and sometimes goes on sale for 50% off dropping the price to $25 for both. If you want to get them now DLGamer (an [official retailer](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/#UnitedStates-digital)) has them [both for $38](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911)

Oh and if you want the full list of free to play restrictions (which you don't have) you can [see them here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Account#Free_accounts).

So... millions of players playing a dead game, which continuously gets updated, since 2015. 
---
Well, that's not the definition of a "dead game". ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Ja
---
Well, that's it for my ideas, so if I guess you could either [submit an issue to get help](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/issues) or [ask on the developer's discord](https://discord.gg/y2MGJYr0).

&gt;Look, I have over 500 gold!
---
I'm mainly a support player, so I don't spend as much time on DPS specs which is why I tend to favor relatively simple rotations or skill priorities that don't punish you much for mistakes. 
---
On that note, I recommend Staff Daredevil for Power DPS and Shortbow Soulbeast for Condi DPS. These are relatively easy builds to deal decent damage with, so you can dedicate more of your attention to staying alive and dealing with mechanics.
---
If you're a bit more experienced though, you might want Power Dragonhunter and Condi Scourge instead. These are also relatively easy builds to play and do great DPS while also providing additional utility. However, it takes a little more learning to get the hang of these classes.
---
My personal favorite is Quickness Firebrand though. Very nice hybrid DPS and boon support, can be geared for either Power or Condi. The Power Quickbrand has a lot in common with Dragonhunter, while I've found the Condi variant almost as easy to play as Condi Soulbeast while being much more supportive in group content.

Theres often combo deals for sale on various authorized retailers.

---
Everything you do/make for the legendary will be account wide. It doesn't matter what if one character does every step or if every step is done by a different character
---
If you're planning on doing a generation 1 legendary, you'll need to do map completion of the core map, and have reached the 3rd tier of the legendary crafting mastery. 
---
For a generation 2 legendary, you can choose to do map completion of the HoT maps or the PoF maps. There are different crafting requirements between the two choices, but personally the HoT method is less awkward (funerary incense is kind of a pain), and have reached the 4th tier of the legendary crafting mastery
---
The easiest (outside of just buying a precursor/legendary) legendaries are probably the newest ones, which pretty much just require a buttload of crafting. The other legendaries have some sort of collection scavenger hunt that you have to complete, which jump around from crafting to killing specific enemies to participating in certain fractals to finishing certain events. They end up at similar costs, but the experience is dramatically different between them
---
Fantastic as usual :D
---
I have no idea what is being run in fractals now (I mainly raid), but have you ever thought of switching from DPS to support role?
---
Healer might suit you well. There usually isn't a fixed rotation and you have plenty of heals yourself, so good survivability there. 
---
In raids people usually run either druids or healing Firebrands. Fractals should be more or less the same. 
---
I've done my share of healing (both fractals and raids) and boi would I recommend it. It's bit more laidback and you will see more of the fight. You will be more aware of what is happening and you might start enjoying the fights even more.
---
When I started with druid, that was something eye-opening. That's when I really fallen in love with raids as I started understanding everything more, started seeing things in the bigger picture.
---
I eventually switched back to dps, but because I had the understanding it was much easier and I was better than I could have been without trying out the supportive role. 
---
I highly recommend you giving it a try. :)
---
The 2k mount skins are all new models. The warclaw skins are all the same.
---
It's not. But it still requires decisions from players and understanding of different layouts. The easiest solution is to make it so when you equip a weapon,. the skills are just there.  The more you raise the bar, the more people fall beneath it.  It may seem ridiculous to you, but Anet took out interactable food in early levels of Queensdale, to make the game easier for some people.

In current Tier 2 matchup this week, TC is up against FC and YB.
---
FC is made up of a large number of bandwagon fight guilds which i bet many servers in NA will struggle against.
---
YB on other hand is just meh. While TC would come and fight FC....YB is more interested in running away and doing PPT.
---
I think you might be best picking a linked server and bandwagon to whoever is linked with Blackgate so you can have twice the number of people than your opponents and kill them easily and feel proud of your achievement :)
