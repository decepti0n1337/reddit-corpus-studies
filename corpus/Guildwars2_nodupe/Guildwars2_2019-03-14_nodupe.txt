As someone who hates wvw and pvp i will never be you :(

You do know how the exchange works right? Every gem there was bought by someone with real money. So if you buy gems with cash or with gold somebody already used cash for the gems.
---
Would anyone mind selling the Dhuum Bench for 20% off?
---
I never really played reaper but for this encounter you need to change build to get as much mobility and evades as you can.
---
First time I did it with my weaver it was not too hard. Fire sword has good mobility and an evade, lightning flash and evade stance. Plus dagger mobility skill.
---
Second time I went for achievements with my chrono for good spike range dmg, respec to condi mirage and triple blink + ambush mobility made it almost cheating. If you don't use mobility and extra evades it is indeed really hard you should really adapt your build 
---
I made the same face as him in this picture when I saw it
---
If you play a class that does not support the raid than why joining the raid? Only for the protection? Yes it is the same on other servers and their good right because in the worst case you block a place in the raid and you are a rally bot for the enemy.
---
You earn the first 4 of gen 2

I could also see how this could be exploited to track players in PvP or WvW...

I recorded this last night; I dismounted but it glitched to where I was still on the Warclaw and I wasn't able to swap weapons: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBWMIgewEBk&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBWMIgewEBk&amp;feature=youtu.be)

I know the mumble api was used for this type of thing.  A quick search brought this very old thread:

---
So true it hurts.
---
All you're really doing when washing really is removing dead skin and other things like contaminates that are mostly attached to said dead skin... In the desert you can't afford to use your water so you just scrub yourself with the sand if there is any or just a dry cloth will work too.  
---
The takeaway here is that you can wash yourself and still smell like the desert :D
---
200g and getting boosted to top4 omegalul
---
I think anything doing things with current player location uses Mumble API for it
---
well i should think that you would not be able to see EVERY player using the program. would not really make sense. im thinking that you would have a private server people can connect to and you would only be able to see them.
---
You are kidding right... a lot of people are asking Anet to actually have some medium armour that is a skirt.  There's only 2 medium skirts and they're both gem store only.
---
Honestly the fact you can even buy that on the TP is kinda gross to me.

The trait applies bleeding but also the axe skills themselves apply bleeding too, especially the axe symbol. It ends up being a non-negligible chunk of your damage, and Sinister or Grieving builds won't do as much damage as Viper. Granted, no matter what your burning damage will be the vast majority of your damage output, but ignoring the bleeding damage would be unwise especially now that Viper is so easy to get as compared to early HoT when it was difficult to get.
---
I'm totally making an asura named "notALightFury"
---
I'm still trying to lock down some points I may or may never be able to.
---
But it's pistol Pistol, using stealth as a main element plus the OP bulk gyro.
---
I say points because it has a certain way of playing that can work but fail at the same time.
---
If I can get it locked down Ill post what I have then :)
---
But... Scrapper isnt locked into Hammer to be good that's for sure
---
Congrats, dude! Took me a long time to make Astralaria too. Well worth it. Enjoy your new shiny!

Agreed!  But it makes them happy, so I'm happy for them.

I do this during the wait after the Chak Gerent too.

That's a pretty stupid thing to assume even for an average redditor.

Who even uses that in pvp?

Anet treats PvP like "stretch armstrong".....pull this way, then this way, then, well, fuck it.

Is this a hidden teaser for chief 500 update? QUICK BUY ALL THE POTATOES!

You mean scrappers.

&gt;literally cannot die

Yes they can, they have heavy counters, power herald is my favorite counter though.
---
Why are you so angry?
---
Currently around 20 amalg and 75 mystic coins off this myself. Can't wait. Congrats!
---
If you have no boosters you can always buy the laurel versions, although they are not the best bang for your buck (last only 30 minutes). A 50% reward track boost helps a lot though just to get the Warclaw track done. 
---
Are you retired? I just cannot see this as possible if you went to school or work regularly like most people while still having a healthy eating and sleeping habit. Are you okay? Should we be concerned?
---
o.o
---
Seriously, congrats and all, but damn that's insane.
---
congratulations! now on to the next one! 
---
omg this is hilarious
---
What game mode is Scrapper good in ? Just curious, never played an engineer before.
---
What I dislike the most is when a pug runs past 95% of the content in a dungeon but expects you to not only know how but to survive it. I have no idea nor do I want to. Running past a little is fine but when I am dead, come back for me. Because I guarantee I will be dead fast as I do not know how to skip.
---
Well and keeps certain somewhat populated, moves new people to try new things when they're populated, just keeps them active overall, even if it's only more active once a month. 
---
Please, condi sb is comparable as is firebrand on largos. You just haven't seen it since most people run mirage.
---
Yeah my group does this on sam all the time.
---
You mean you can't play the hard-to-kill class that you wanted to play because there's an even-harder-to-kill class finally getting a chance to shine in *one* single aspect of the game (while firebrands are meta for literally every game mode)?
---
My heart breaks for you.
---
I’d eat there. Sounds ace. 
---
Blackgate or any T1 server. You can expect them to be active all day long.
---
Reasonable is different depending on the player though. Skins for 400 gems / 50g to some people is excessive, while people that may have come from other games with more greedy cash shops might think 800 gems is a bargain.
---
Personally, I just think we need more options to get them. For instance if they put these skins out, 400 gems each for an RNG box, 2000 for the whole pack, or say, 600 gems to pick the one you want, no RNG.
---
This being a WvW mount should have an option to get SOME kind of skin with 4 dye channels from actually doing WvW though, with tickets and/or badges and/or reward track stuff. The point of the mount was to get people into WvW, they should have had a skin as a longer term goal to keep people in WvW.
---
I'm expecting Lord Vanquish weapons to be black and on fire

They are the embodiment of magic that is running rampant in ls3 maps.

---
I doubt that we will get elite specs in LW5, but if we do we will not know about it until the trailer for LW5 episode 1 is released. ArenaNet are very averse to hyping up their content.
---
Well considering they didn't even plan an expansion at all before the layoffs, I doubt even they possess that information.
---
Gold, sure.
---
But 39k+ AP on two accounts on top of 20 world completions, 12 legendary weapons, and 6 legendary armors.
---
I guess if the weapons are all Gen 1 and some/most of the armors are PvP/WvW, it's not as surprising as they could just be gained by buying gold via gems and spending time in either PvP or WvW. But the AP part alone is a bit incredible though.
---
This is hearsay. We don’t know whether they were planning an expansion, just that S5 is next, and two unknown projects were cancelled. 
---
Well. Nothing stopped you from just jumping off and bodying the entire horde of em.
---
Any tips on getting the 3-ele pulls? Every time my group tries that it either doesn't pull them far enough, or doesn't pull all 3....
---
I’ve collected a bunch of ascended rings through fractals, and I need to start getting rid of them. My end goal is to have Mesmer, Necro, Ele, Ranger, Guard, and Engi up to speed for Raids, Fractals, and WvW .. 
---
My question is what stats on ascended rings can be trashed / salvaged? I know that there are several which are never used, but I don’t know which ones. 
---
Where?
---
&gt;Mike Z sat down with us at  Gamescom and revealed that Guild Wars 2 would not get a third expansion
---
Sometimes it's good, but blockading spawn points with gankers is as lame as gate camping in Eve Online. 
---
Also there are different wvw guilds some are having fun with strategy, some are really, really passionate.
---
Neat.  I did it using frost bow and other ice skills on my ele.  Ice runes and sigils of chill, etc.
---
That was what I was thinking, too. Smells Like Teen Spirit ...
---
That's not a Mike Z quote. That's the title of an article written by a third party.  Sorry to burst your bubble, but you need to find something Mike said, not something a journalist said. Journalists, even gaming journalists, tend to try to make headlines by massaging the truth. It's called clickbait for a reason.
---
those are hybrid builds not supports..if your argument is any type of buff=support then i guess when people stacked dps chronos and chained timewarp on xera they were actually playing 10 support squads that somehow outperformed normal dps squads..can you see how much of a twisted logic that is?
---
but sure i mean you're doing exactly what i said in my previous comment..stretching it hardcore
---
chrono dps is probably around 70k or something if you go full batshit crazy and attribute buffs as dps "given to other classes" and just compare a squad with quickness and without..at this point why not just add the might from druid as well
---
i can blast some firefields for might on my holo..does that mean i'm a support that does 33k? yay 
---
If you're so convinced then maybe you should find your own article that confirms there's gonna be another expansion? As far as i've seen, we've gotten nothing of the sort. "Yeah there's gonna be another expansion just because" isn't a convincing argument.
---
“Guild Wars 2 would not get a third expansion, at least not any time soon.”
---
You cut that line off, which isn’t even a direct quote. That last portion could mean it’s been underway for a while, but not close, or it could mean they weren’t planning one. My point is that we don’t know, and it’s not a legitimate fact, it’s an inference. 
---
in·fer
---
/inˈfər/
---
verb
---
deduce or conclude (information) from evidence and reasoning rather than from explicit statements.
---
honestly? Time. Nostalgia is the most powerful drug man has ever come across, and it warps perceptions to the point of absurdity.
---
Take the stars wars prequels for example. Pure garbage, terrible from pretty much every angle, but now they are loved and applauded by tons of people as being genuinely good films, and their glaring flaws are treated as minor concerns. What changed? People recalled how they *felt* when they had first seen them, and then base their entire perception off that feeling.
---
Nostalgia is crazy.
---
You can infer whatever you want from the article, doesn’t make it a fact. Neither of us are saying one way or the other that it was in development, just that you’re not presenting evidence to back up your statements. You’re creating misinformation by making a factual claim without evidence. My point is that we don’t know, but you’re pretending that we do. 
---
Cantha isnt all about humans though. You have the Tengu, the Naga, the Celestials... And the whole Kurzicks vs Luxons thing has been a favorite of a lot of people and it would be nice to see how the region has developed after the Ministry of purity took over.
---
And with some brain use, you can build a Soulbeast that is useful for groups regardless. Maybe not as 'flawless' as a Firebrand or the likes, but people might have to get their head out of their rears and read their Specialization lines, not slavishly obey Metabattle.com all the time.
---
While not Soulbeast exclusive, a 'Boonbeast' with Warhorn and Stance share can hand out Fury, Protection, Stability, Regen, Swiftness to the team. Plus One Wolf Pack.
---
Given what happened to the Chronomancer Elite Specialization, or the Mesmer in general, expect the same to happen to other 'Everything and the Kitchen Sink' 'Meta' builds, down the line.
---
It is what I believe, simply due to the lack of evidence that there actually is a third expansion in the works. Mike Z could have always cleared his name and said the article is false if that's what it was, but his silence allows me to INFER that there was no expansion in the works during the time prior to the layoffs.
---
This is amazing! You did really well with it! That would be so cool running around there 
---
“Well considering they didn't even plan an expansion at all before the layoffs, I doubt even they possess that information.”
---
You didn’t say they “probably weren’t working on one before the layoffs.” You said it as a fact, which it isn’t. You then proceeded to dig yourself in further, even insulting my reading comprehension, all because I understand what qualifies as a fact. The grown up thing to do would be to say, “Sorry, guess I was wrong.” But no, now you’re trying to change what you said, when it’s still right above this conversation. 
---
This is your exact quote:
---
We don't know what they planned for long term or what they did or didn't start working on from the content of the interview. You said they didn't start working on an expansion. I remember people saying that during the first expansion.
---
But in fact, what they are working on is stuff for the game. An expansion is to some degree a delivery mechanism. 
---
There's no evidence to say that they weren't or were working on what, and you said they weren't. You're making an assumption. 
---
It's likely that you're right, but it's not proven that you're right. They might, in fact, be slowly working toward an expansion they plan to release eventually.  We simply don't know. At least not from this interview/article. No matter what the title of the article claims.
---
Ok so a group that is:
---
Gr1: Alac Ren, QuickFB, DPS, DPS, DPS
---
Gr2: QuickFB, Druid, Warr, DPS, DPS
---
Is this a group with only one support?
---
Gr1: Chrono, Druid, DPS, DPS, DPS
---
Gr2: Chrono, Warr, DPS, DPS, DPS
---
Is this suddenly a group with 3 supports?
---
&gt;if you go full batshit crazy and attribute buffs as dps "given to other classes"
---
Why would you think that is batshit crazy? If people found out that spirits/GoE were no longer worth bringing because a DPS slot did more to increase group DPS than a Druid bringing them... People would take it. Like no shit you need to compare the complete package. The reason AP and Soulcleave are attributed to the Renegade for comparison purposes is because it's the only class that can realistically bring them to a raid without being dead weight.
---
Cool, that’s a belief, and could have been prefaced that way. Personally, I share that belief, but I wouldn’t falsely present it as a fact. 
---
True, and I knew that before commenting too. But what I said is still true, whether the OP copied a piece from a previous other mount skin, he/she still thought of it while the black lion skin devs did not. If you check his/her other works you could see how much better the mount designs are compared to majority of the mount skins we have in game. 
---
So yes opinions are like a h**** everyone has one, but I stand by that a fan can make mount designs better than developer made. If the mount skins were as good as the fans designs, anet would have more gems bought from me, but sadly most skins are meh, and pass them by.
---
This is the exact reason why I open beginner friendly dungeon runs in lfg. You want to watch the story? Go ahead, we wait. You die because something was happening you're maybe not aware of yet? Ask and we explain. No skips, no "super pro stealth stacking whatever just gotto go fast" strats.
---
I do understand that some people don't want to spend hours in dungeons, but still farm them for the 5 gold and some other stuff. The key for a happy dungeon life is, how you set up the lfg request. If you join a group that is already named "only lvl. 80 with exp", don't expect them to wait for your or explain anything. Join Story groups instead. And if there is no story group, open your own lfg. It will fill up in no time for most of the dungeons.
---
New to wvw but I've been playing a lot the last few days and the commanders policy is :
---
 - strongly advise people to switch class if squad is not full
---
 - once the squad is full or the map has queue kick rangers out to make spots.
---
I think it kinds of make sense 
---
Pretty sure it was temporary and they can now que on their mains.  
---
also wondering this. /u/QuelThelas?
---
Ahh, they're beautiful! I can't even pick a favorite with how much I like them all!
---
The do that so people dont exploit builds on a large scale. When you have time to test out builds everyone will come to same conclusion of exploiting op shit and it will reveal how shit the balance was. But when they release in the middle some people usually tend to stick to whatever they were playing before as they are most comfortable on it and have found prev success on it and do not jump boats easily.
---
Good pick, one of best-looking legendaries. After grinding for the Meteorlogicus I too wanted to craft this one, but then boredom struck and I left for ages. Now, I can't say I'd like to return and continue as Anet has downsized and hasn't got any plans for any expansion pack to revitalize the game; an unfortunate decline.
---
Amazing work on your character!
---
True. Even the specs they announced before HoT have been completely different in the end. At least some of them.
---
This said: If LW5 comes with new elite specs, I would suggest them to announce this latest with the end of LW4. New specs have a much higher impact on the game than a new map, new legendary or new fractal/raid. Announcing them one week prior to release with the usual trailer they throw out, will steal away a lot of traction this would get otherwise.
---
The only PvE meta stats from fractals are berserkers ([Crystalline Band](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crystalline_Band) + [Ring of Red Death](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ring_of_Red_Death). Knight can technically be used on a chrono in place of berserker to raise toughness for tanking but isn't used otherwise in PvE Cavalier and Berserker/valkyrie have some use in WvW on power classes and Celestial is meta on a few as well.
---
I mained scrapper pre-POF, and this is it 100%. Scrapper could sustain and kill most other meta-builds, and the Warrior of the day was pretty much on par, probably a 40-60 ratio in favour of warrior. But if you ever saw a reaper coming your way, you /bow and head the other direction. People have just forgotten how to kill scrapper. It's weak to high condition pressure, high power burst, weak to highly mobile classes who can engage and disengage easily (condi thief was a hard fight if the thief was patient). Scrapper cannot chase effectively, it fights to win points, but the rise of mirage/fall of firebrand/scourge has created a meta where you fight to get kills and builds have become highly optimized around that idea. These are not good against a scrapper, but that does not mean scrapper has no counters.
---
I don't want to participate in that discussion because we really can't tell what the new plans for GW2 look like. But there is one thing I want to add.
---
If you want to make a point, don't just copy handpicked lines to your convenience. There is something like "out of context", often used in politics to shit on other people just to pretend that your opinion is more valid than what the counterpart said.
---
People can believe what they want in my opinion. But leaving out half of a statement is not the right way to change someones mind. And to be honest... Both of you could be right. When Mike Z made this statement, Arena Net was pretty much working on other projects and most likely didn't plan to release another expansion because of that. But as we all know, projects got canceled. So while this might have been true 6 months ago doesn't mean, that it is still today.
---
It would have to be small bonus or bonus to thing that is "decent but probably not worth going for full-time".
---
We all know how players work when you have "this gives better rewards now!"
---
That's why double XP or double anything wouldn't work so well.
---
Someone excels that gold/hour impact and if it's below X or Y then it's "shit and not worth doing". If it's close or above X or Y then it's all People do for weekend for 8 hours a day.
---
Then people feel "forced" to do that because "rewards are just so good this weekend!*.
---
Good thing with no special bonuses like this is that it doesn't feel like you are missing out on something major. You do what you want to do.
---
Thank you for this answer! You’ve answered my question :)
---
Yeah I’ve met him a few times when I was ranking up, gave him a report every time I saw him. He’s a real piece of work.
---
Well as a newbie without mount you're just always left behind and get picked up by other players
---
I never seen ppl asking for mirage on LFG usually they ask for condi dps, and if you dont want play mirage and find a group asking for it, just dont join that group, ppl really need stop asking for nerfs, i rather have other classes buffed then nerfing a existent one that works in literally 3 bosses...
---
PPl just gotta be real and start ask for BUFFS in the classes that i wanna play, this nerf FIASCO has been running the game for so long, ppl just dont realise that...
---
well it is a dying game anyway...
---
You clearly didn't read far enough in then because I state at least a couple of times that this probably changed after the layoffs happened which is also when those said projects got canned.
---
Playin 5 Wells will NEVER be Meta in any sort of way. The reason? WoC and WoR are either just DPS or Aegis/Stability, which is basicly useless in Raids, especially on a Suppirt Character. WoE is most definitely a viable Pick, due to the strong Heal/AoE Cleanse. Same for GravWell which is one of the best CC Elites.
---
I my self want SoI out of Meta, but youll play either Mimic+dWells or dWells + iDis for DPS. Nothing else is even worth taking for Chrono in Supp Slot.
---
And not gonna even start to argue about the SoE. SoE is pretty strong witg resetting Phantasms, yes thats right. But sacrificing your only Heal for DPS makes you a class canon (especially with light armor and no defensive traits) without survivability. So its a equal Trait and it has its right to be strong. Any kind of nerf towards it would downright destroy the Reason behind the functionality. 
---
Don't expect anymore dungeons aside from new fractals
---
lolol
---
Muting won't make them sabotage the match, which Op was relating to. 
---
Because im always gonna keep thosr to craft that stuff when i dont need that kind of stuff uh?
---
And because im always gonna go for crafting that Stuff to empty my Material storage? F no.. Still gonna continue Trashing those Items.
---
OP's idea was basicly that, to have some QoL item for Trash Items you cant even sell.... 
---
Would be impressive if you had gotten all of the Coins, but only 2/3 is meh :D  
---
Get for ur necro a warhorn, it gives decent swiftness. Spectral walk gives swiftness too. Cast a shade before popping the swiftness. 
---
Thanks, will try
---
My thought would be to do a falling off bonus.
---
So you have your catagories of Living world(pve), WVW, PVp, fractals, and raids.  and they rotate with one receiving no bonus. 
---
Week 1 PVE +100%, WvW +80%, Raids +60%, Pvp +40%, Fractals +20%
---
Week 2 Fractals +100%, Pve+80%, wvvw
---
You get the idea, maybe have it be that as experience drops magic find increases for that game mode.
---
 
---
They won’t go back on the leap distance because that is the fix to the exploits. Why would you change every map if you can just change the leap distance lul 
---
Don’t take it personal lad, after playing and teaching the game for 6 years some people just can’t be bothered anymore. If you like the game mode you will stay. 
---
How does the spear give the effect above water?
---
Another thing is, if after reviewing his gameplay, it comes down to something mechanical like camera movement not being fast enough to see if enemies attack him from behind, try turning on action cam for him. It might be hard to readjust to the new control style, but it also could help him if camera movement is an issue
---
I know, I was just kitting him up to dervish with meloni and my main char. Together we form the sunspear's only squadron of "Beyblades"
---
I solo'd endgame boss lupi the other day in 1:56:32

Would need all three plus Eotn to max it out most likely.
---
The boar sandwich sounds delicious.
---

---
ok i could have kinda agreed on the other stuff but this??
---
Thanks! Honestly i hate farming, so with gemstones it was part farming, part crafting, part buying (but smallest part :'D. But, yes, gemstones ware my nightmare, even more than mystic coins and ores from DS.

One of the 3 base games + Eye of the North
---
You are looking at the 99th percentile. If you look at the 50th the gap narrows incredibly. Most people who play the game don't end up in the 99%, to 2k for soulbeast.
---
The people here bitching aren't in 99% meta speedclear groups.
---
Bugs out all the time with mounts, not sure what actually causes that though.  
---
There is a way to force it:  
---
Unequip it on land, draw your land weapon and reequip the spear.  
---
That's an old bug that still works though it can be tempermental and go away when you auto sheathe your weapons.
---
That is true though.
---
It appears to have also cost you an arm. :)
---
Admittedly I'm specifically going for the heritage mantle. I think it's around 5 points? Any idea how long that'll take?
---
Seems like they’re always out of stock though. Apparently those drakes are eating all the fish.

I say we consume her

Oh god, even this sub has been contaminated?

/r/EnoughMuskSpam
---
what is this viking funeral talk you are talking about?
---
Thanks, my memory is bad 
---
Everyone prefers to say diferently good bye. But eating her ? I would understand it when you would be behind lines and wouldnt have food for a long time but she was fighting by your side for a long time. She just died and you will say on it "\*\*\*\* it let's not waist that meat". 
---
i think there was a post yesterday
---
First the Viking funeral .. then you can go catch the boat and do as you want. 
---
Good points. I'd like to add: pressuring defenders/siege on walls.
---
As a commander I often have more soulbeasts than firebrands and scourges (combined) in my squad. I (try to) adapt my style of commanding to the people in the squad. I like to put all soulbeasts, deadeyes, ... in one party and ask one of them to mark targets (focus party wise). 
---
I also like to joke about soulbeasts in voice chat. (eg for once you could use your lb4 and you let him fly away?, if only we had more soulbeasts we had destroyed that ac).
---
Hmm I wonder by who ? o\_O 
---
You inverted colors.
---
Classes that are buffed, and opponents that didn't have the time to adapt yet.
---
I hope she's rotting in a ditch somewhere:)
---
Dont get me wrong. I dont want to make it easier. But sometimes you cant out of combat for some reason and /gg works there.
---
I am currently opening Noxious seed pouches and bandit loot bags on a level 49 character, am I doing it right? I tried opening bag of loots but seem to get very little coins from it. 
---
Then it's your loss.
---
&gt; That does not take into consideration the effect of WXP boosters, but it also does not take into consideration the fact that permanently maintaining tier 6 participation is required. Many new players aren't going to have any WXP boosters and they're also going to have difficulty maintaining tier 6 when they can't keep up with the zerg.
---
I'm a novice player in that mode, that exclusively plays WvW when I need a gift of battle, or 5 minutes a day for dailies. If you have a brain, you can keep the participation up ...
---
Try to get ministrel weapons and trinkets first, in the meanwhile mix nomad and giver, use concentration sigil and foods, sanctuary or durability runes. Better survive and support the squad at 70%bd than being dead at 100%bd
---
Find me a good bunch of PvP oriented games with no toxicity at all ....
---
Well, everybody has access to the same classes and the same time to adapt to balance changes. I would argue that adapting to a new meta faster than others is a matter of skill, so I dont see a problem, if players who do so, win more matches than those that dont.
---
ATM for fractals soulbeast is full zerk with scholar runes, with pots and fury and banner you should have enough precision, 
---
On raids you should bring thief runes instead of scholar, be aware that now one of your damage modifiers comes from flanking the boss.
---
Not long at all. You get 3 points for linking accounts and 2 points for any statue. By the time you get to EotN you may very well have everything you need for the mantle. And if you don't, you can buy a minipet for cheap, dedicate it, and that will net you 3 points.

[Here's the official calculator they came out with for it.](https://hom.guildwars2.com/en/#page=main&amp;details=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA)

It doesnt really matter before lvl80, most things can be solo'd in story, but if you're talking late game then yea, guardian can be the tank and you can be boon/healer with Tempest spec! Or you can be boon/dps too amd it can be the other way around guardian can become healer/support while you tank 😂
---
To answer your questions, yes its a good match!
---
So now even subs for specific games are not safe from Melon wankery. I will never fathom why Musk is so appealing to the masses. Pathetic.
---
They eat eachother so it's okay
---
there were. basically 500 people hating each other. They were occasionally called "the salt mines".
---
other than that there's the official forums.
---
Not expansion specifically, but yeah, f2p can't convert gold to gems.
---
Solid advice, thank you very much! I'll do this.
---
I would introduce one new elite spec per new LW5 map. Then they will have enough time to adjust it.
---
I maintain that it would be a whole lot better if there was a slight blur or give-away about where the character was so that you could at least throw AOE's at them.
---
Yes do this. In that way you would not have to worry too much about AR infusion in Rev's armor.
---
Dh doesnt excell at all in wvw roaming, also fb is perfectly viable for roaming, even solo roaming with a decent build.
---
True
---
DH is a really solid pick for easy DPS in fractals. With traps, having some ranged dps with scepter if required and access to blocks and dodge along with greatsword 5 pull to group mobs and Dragons Maw gives great CC too, all in all a very nice pick, including in pugs where you get no boons.
---
Try putting largos with mirages.
---
If your meaning consume Aurene to get her magic this only works with gods and dragons.
---
Yes, fairly simple and self sufficient
---
Can caladbolg be stat-picked as Diviner's? The wiki says no but the metabattle how to gear guide says you can choose any heart of thorn stats and that Diviner's has been retroactively added to HoT.
---
Wiki may not have been updated for all the objects that can use HoT related stats. However since Diviner was added to all the LS3 trinkets (since it appeared in PvP during HoT) I think it is fair to assume that you can select Diviner on Caladblog.
---
that's not true kormoir consumed some energy from a god and became only then a goddess 
---
Didn't he specifically ask for the end of the season, during the offseason ? I'm not very aware of Pvp schedule.
---
According to https://silverwastes.loltools.net/ level 49 is in the range.
---
Check for prices of raw/refined materials to see what is more profitable and then sell on the TP the T3/T4 materials you salvaged from the gear (leather, wood and metal mostly).
---
congratulation. i build astralaria myself this week. Took me over 1 year, because i hate farming gold :-)
---
But if you know how, its pretty simple and fast.
---
I was very unlucky with mystic clover . only 10.5% in the mystic toilet.
---
And you know "after legendary is before legendary" ;-)
---
after Sunrise, Aurora, Astralaria its time for a back piece. But i dont play PvP, dont have a fractal group and my guildies are not very good at fractals ... 
---
The people here complaining most definitely include the 99% meta speedclear groups. Hell, looking at the 99th percentile doesn't even really represent how oppressive mirage is on Largos, since few decent players even upload their logs to raidar. There's still a very large gap between 99th percentile and the DPS top players actually pull on mirage, and it just gap betweeen mirage and anything else just keeps growing to the point where even if you want to play another class, it just feels like you're throwing by not playing mirage.
---
Scrapper sure rocks ass right now at the golem. There is literally no raid PUG that doesnt specifically ask for DPS scrappers since last balance patch.
---
it should be the waterfall west of Bay Haven, in Sandycove Beach (not the one you can see on the map)

Simple advice to get higher DPS : always put symbols first, and don't cast traps/spirit sword without at least a symbol or F1 active.
---
I used to play PvP with my roommate. We played tournaments together. She was in plat too. Gw2 spreads by word of mouth and so does PvP knowledge
---
Then please, show me a case where another class comes even close to a top level mirage.
---
No. These boards are reused assets from amnoon.
---
WvW won't grow in popularity, pve players have got their warclaw and have now left the mode.
---
If he get's double outdamaged by a condi class in every fight on DH he is not doing well.
---
And make it a thief to copy the stealth ability.
---
If he wants to play Guardian, it's preferred that yu play a range to accommodate his frontline tanking.
---
Ele, Ranger and Mesmer are more suited to playing the backline with their superior ranged weapon options, while Necro is somewhat of an inbetween due to their slightly weaker weapon range but brings more fun to the party with minions. 
---
All ~~six~~ five of them.
---
They actually did it that way when seasons released iirc?
---
On ONE boss.....lol
---
Sometimes the simplest solutions are the most effective.
---
Roast boar sandwich? Better get those while you can before i show up.
---
Amazing 200 IQ strategy from Anet
---
Does sigil of force affects the whole build or just the weapon I put it on? E.g if I put it on warhorn will it only affect warhorn or mainhand weapon as well?
---
ON which boss specifically? Deadeyes, weavers and holos can be better than mirages pending on what boss? I don't get why people are ignoring this lol Mirage is top on THREE bosses - Largos, SH and Matthias. It's literally NOWHERE on the power bosses. Whatever. I have every class so I could care less. I just don't get this panty wetting over mirage.
---
If you were a firebrand, you could have used Frostfang and made frozen footfalls like in the trailer! https://i.imgur.com/nta2bjN.gif
---
Just when i thought this sub uses ancient memes already, this gets posted. Damn.
---
Sadly, most of the times its the 2nd. And in even fight, the group with more rallybot pugs loses.
---
Excellent! Good job :) I kind of want to see them make one that spawns a ghost city now haha.
---
I can't handle the grind for legendaries but It's always nice to see others getting them \^\_\^
---
I've never actually seen people complaining about it though, I've only seen people claim that there were people complaining about it. I find it odd since Kryta is basically "Europe land" and the same for Elona but Africa with Egyptian vibes specifically.
---
Also I've seen other games seemingly do the same thing like Blade and Soul, and Revelation Online, but I've seen literally nobody complain about those either. I don't buy it honestly.
---
You-re so kind, thanks a lot! :D 
---
Who doesn't bring them? This is all anecdotal. We just one shot DHuum tonight with no mirages at all and 2 condi necros? DO u understand how many people are actually really shit at mirage? I mean I have every class so its all immaterial to me. I think people look at golem figures from snowcrows and think everything is irrelevant. In the real raiding world, that isn't the case.
---
pretty cool :D makes me wanna try do draw my ele too
---
It probably won't be that easy via lfg anyway. I've run this event many times completely random, but last 12 months or so... ugh. That's why our super über mega raid squad will join\* hoping that they will cause enough havoc for it to work smoothly.
---
But... all my event squads are super relaxed so nobody should be afraid to come if they are not sure about the event or their class. =D
---
^((\*actually I am forcing them to come))
---
Dhuum has nothing to do with this, considering it's not one of the bosses that mirage is oppressive on, and mentioning it in this context proves you don't understand why people are complaining about it.
---
Also, oneshotting bosses has nothing to do with the classes you bring, but the players. It's irrelavent here as well
---
Sigils affect the whole build including utility skills as long as you are on the weapon set that has this sigil: so if you swap to your other weapon set (when applicable) you will then benefit from the sigils of this weapon set and no longer from those from the initial one.

You don't need to be "good" to get the PvP Legendary backpack, sure being good makes it go a bit faster. A lot of the Achievement things you need to do is win 1/3/3/5 games as X class (I think those numbers are right although been ages), get a certain amount of kills, win a total matches in ranked, capture points I think is one. 
---
But if you've got a 50% winrate then every second game will count towards your win
---
Ranked pvp is also nice that it'll match you with people that are similar to your level, and if you end up in bronze or silver, well the people that might call you bad usually aren't very good themselves lol. The gold is also decent
---
I found it was mostly a time sink, especially when I had to play classes I wasn't used to or never played before. On a sidenote, I went from 0 Ele/Weaver experience to getting into plat 2

I've learned that when it comes to memes and internet culture, a lot of GW players generally live in a cave. Same goes for alot of MMO's though. 
---
Of course I understand that people are really shit at Mirage - I made that comment in my first post that I *actively avoid playing it* (disabilities are fun and committing new rotations to muscle memory is painful) and my static doesn't enforce Mirages (though they'll be sitting pretty at 30k after Nikare with other dps around 19k). Goodness.
---
If we want to get to the point of it being anecdotal and throwing that around while ignoring numerical evidence of Raidar comparisons there isn't really much basis for a conversation. This has nothing to do with SC golem numbers (which aren't presented with confusion modifiers anyway) so I'm not sure why that is being brought up.

Killing veterans and elite will Zelots will spawn. Find them and kill them. They will have traits from bounty system. After that go where the final boss will spawn. There are 5 places where you need groups with a lot of CC. Dont focus on the demage but on the Cc. Cc them to oblivion and they will not be able to charge anything. After you will kill those 5 you can enjoy your final boss fight. Killing the pet is pointless when he will get resurected immediately. After this last bos fight (where my Pc always drop so I never have the reward) you can go to the back "Jp" for the Ley Line Anomaly achievement. Its also needed for one of those specialization collections. I was commanding it as well many time and we always did it even tho I never was able to see the end myself =/. 
---
U still dont get it? GW2 is a farm game from its bone, every end game item requires thousands of materials to made, and they dont magically appears from "enjoying" the game
---
As a work around for future problems: Since you use SMS authentication, you likely have a smartphone with you. I'd suggest getting an authenticator app and do the authentication with that one instead of SMS. Its much more reliable and you can use authentication apps on just about any platform, be it iOS, Android, or Windows.

Okay then, I'll explain it again. Nerf the confusion it generates so I can play other classes without feeling like I'm throwing
---
This is great, I have been considering running a D&amp;D campaign with GW1 as a "module", bringing my players along that storyline. I think it might be a bit tough to have everything fit in perfectly, but there's definitely room for overlapping. 
---
I will keep an eye on this and I'll probably try to take some part in it, it's a wonderful idea to have this open to participation.
---
Are you thinking of suggesting alterations to D&amp;D classes so they look/feel similar to those of GW ? And are you thinking of incorporating the Eden as the "low-level initiation" ? There's really a lot of things in that game.
---
~~What about running straight to Droknar to get the best stuff real fast ?~~

Must have been south africa, we get government actioned blackouts regularly for 2 hours on some days

I'd be glad if there were all the missing skins for underwater weapons brought to the game...
---
My favourite! Seriously anything that makes me look at environment rather than minimap wins for me
---
Or a more simple tweaking of percentages, such that any core spec that is put into the 3rd slot where the Elite spec is supposed to be, automatically gets X% boost to the stats or effects its specialised to do.
---
I don't ever ping any kind of "proof", because they all mean absolutely nothing.
---
that was actually confirmed to be a simple missing tag during the furst stresstest/beta weekend thing. still the impression was dire.
---
God, I'd give some very important organs to just have a PvP mode that wasn't capture-point. I love capture-point modes in other games, but with the sheer mobility GW2 classes have it feels like a poor fit. A payload mode would be a great fit.
---
Capture points just seem to incentivize playing really degenerate and unfun builds - I should know, I was our bunker back when full-on bunkers were a thing. My entire job was to stall and make the game go slower. :v
---
"I'm trying to heal you, not bloody shag you!"
---
Yeah well but you have the diference in decision. In raids you have just one set you can go for. One set of skins for all the classes. In WvW or Pvp you have more sets. Soe without effects and some glowing so much that I want to burn my eyes 
---
Some players are dedicated scouts who spend hours looking after keeps and towers: escorting dolyaks to upgrade them, building and refreshing siege, running supply to fix damaged walls and gates. It's understandable they get a little upset when all the hard work gets wasted because nobody answers to their cries for help. However, there are plenty of people who simply just spam and rage no matter what you do to help them. As for your questions why don't they move or tag up? It's simply just easier to be a backseat driver and shout nonsense than do something about the situation at hand. WvW has so many people with different playstyles (Everyone being 100% sure their way to play is the only correct way) that these clashes happen quite often over the smallest things. My advice would be to just not take things too seriously and have fun :&gt;
---
Exactly this. All these people thinking it's about squad boons only... 
---
100 man queue means there are plenty of players willing to follow. Literally waiting to follow. 
---
You kick rangers and other snowflakes to make space for more useful people. Why would any comm cater to entitled players demanding special treatment when they just take up space of players willing to actually play with the group? 
---
Having 35 in squad on a 100 man
---
queued map shows exactly why elitism is required. 170+ players in map and queue combined and barely 35 can get into squad. Rather sad for a team game.
---
Wvw comms are the same as those raiders. You can adapt and contribute or get out and find another group.
---
5 tries for a 250LI group is trash. I expect to kill boss 2nd 3rd try at most when reqs are that high. Unless you slip up like tank getting caught up in a wall, dude dodging out of the platform or smth (which is understandable to happen once or twice) is alright. But druid failing all pushes or, cc being thrown around like mad or people walking into red circles is just not cool.

---
Fractal instability rework, rune and sigil rework, a new mount. I think that's it.
---
Bah, just assume those lucky plebs constantly get a maximum of kps each boss kill, so do not risk and put somewhere around t least 100 kp, should be fine. Anyway, you'll find a fine squad, with high requirements. The highest those are, the better the squad is. Otherwise, you might not win a fight in 5 minutes with all those casuals lurking around raid lobby. You may even wipe once, so you'll have to kick a person who caused a wipe and  look for new player, nobody wants that, right? I think waiting few hours for ppl she meet requirements definitely worth it.
---
But seriously, most sorts of kp is not a good thing overall. Firstly, it really locks out new players. We pve players made fud of those wvw players who've been complaining about lack of ppl in their mode and then started complaining about pve casuals swarming their wvw (there's very few dudes like that, but they are quite loud), but raiding community do the same thing.
---
Also, those kps do not even represent how good you players are. Let's say, some thief player decided to gear up a chrono, as more desired role, but he has all those sweet decorations and able to ping them. He actually knows the encounter, but he's a novice as chrono and does chrono stuff shitty. And also one can fake a kp. 
---
I dont know correct solution of that problem, but current kp situations kinda produce a lot of toxic elitism.
---
scourge is the best condi dps class for 99% of players
---
but that pitchfork is zerker, casuals don't run berseker gear
---
What exactly means "balanced" in your eyes? I cant help but wholeheartedly disagree with you stating the game is not balanced.
---
Thats how I feel everytime In WvW. Commander is fighting and Im sneaking around with my thief trying not get into the fight =P 
---
you'd think charr would be too as they are native to tyria.  the only race who couldn't be would be humans.

Honestly if exploring and doing the world are boring you are probably in the wrong game mate.  You can run fractals or pvp I guess but outside of the few things like that the games bread and butter is exploration and open world adventures.  
---
&gt;one does not need to kill a boss 50 times to understand it

Really? I looove this argument.  Then go join groups that don't ask for 50kp.

I don't see how gearcheck being allowed in end-game raiding content was so bad.

I don't know. We could also imagine most mortals would just explode under such power, and that only chosen ones are strong enough, physically and mentally, to succeed, even using the right way.

Oh sweet, if you only want Wings of Ascension, then it's just playing PvP til you fill up all the pips in each division. Which will net you 110 tickets, buying all the wings costs you 100, so you've got 10 left over to buy a Llama mini :)
---
Wow, that sucks.  I read all of The Orrator when I first learned of it, and really enjoyed it.  I just assumed he moved onto other things when updates died down.
---
how is this related to what i said? in no way..you just assumed i have issues joining groups or something because you are so obtuse and thick you can't possibly imagine somebody being different or seeing things in a different way..or caring about stuff that doesn't affect me directly?
---
i'm so sick of this argument..i mean why would i care if a system if flawed if it doesn't directly affect me right? i can't for example talk about foster care issues cuz i grew up with my natural parents right? so so silly
---
what i said was that the kp system doesn't accurately reflect on one's knowledge
---
your counter to that? some nonsense
---
Just 16 days ago he was bullish on beating the cancer.  It most have made a turn for the worse.  Cancer sucks.
---
It's hard to define "Only used in WvW" since that's a player-side thing.
---
Low req groups fill slower than 300+ ones because of ppl being scared of having to raid with bad people. Bad people exist in any requirement but maybe they are easier to carry then.
---
At world, wvw it’s fine 30-50 fps. Viable to play.
---
But i tried to go in Conquest. 
---
And it’s a hell. I have 1second lag every few seconds.
---
And i also put it on low resolution 
---
IIRC most of it requires ranked play, so a large part of it isn't obtainable off season. I really wanted to complete this but being forced to play ranked with classes I don't enjoy really makes it suck.

Repeatedly using a known bug to gain an advantage = exploiting?

Hi OP, I hope you dont mind but I love this so much and would to tinker with animating the water in wallpaper engine! I have a question about the foreground in this image- are the lanterns resting on solid ground on floating on water? And then is there a separate body of water between the illuminated building in the distance and the bridge or is this darker area just distant building? Maybe it's just the glow of the building that makes that look like water? Hope my questions make sense! great job on your amazing work!
---
It matters because it frames how you an approach the situation. Decorations were not meant to be KPs they were meant to be decorations but "we" are using them as such for lack of a better tool. Therefore it is no surprise that this tool can be imperfect and has limitations because it was not designed for this use. Random comparison attempt: you can probably plant a small nail in a wall not made of concrete concrete in you home with the back of a shoe but if you try to plant a bigger nail between 2 wood pieces it will probably not work out as great as if you had a proper tool.
---
Wouldn't you agree that those 2 situations are vastly different in the way this situation should be looked at?
---
* Anet implemented KPs as a way to count how many times you killed a boss (but still week-gated like LIs) but added a RNG so that player can't know exactly how many times you killed a boss but only have a rough idea.
---
* Anet implemented guild decorations rewards to raid to be used as is or transformed into a bronze/silver/gold statue to put in a guild hall for "glory" and style. Because it is tied to a specific boss players decided, later on, to use them as a proof that you killed a boss at least X number of times (and not just that you killed it).
---
In the 1st case you would ask Anet to fix a behavior that they intended and designed something for. In the 2nd case you are asking Anet to change a system for a totally unrelated and non intended reason that players created while knowing from the start that this use had limitations. The reason why player had to default to this imperfect situation is probably a better direction to look at imo.
---
It's called missed opportunities. Always forvever
---
To expand, Giver's armor and Minstrels trinkets and weapons give slightly more toughness and a total of 2k less health. Decent trade for cheaper gear. Weapons are always the biggest upgrade when moving from Exotic &gt; Ascended, so prioritising them to be Minstrel is rather important.
---
But yeah, working to Minstrel, even exotics, via the grandmaster shards or Triumphant track is preferable.
---
Have you ever heard of a phone? What program do you use for communication with your team?  Discord, Teamspeak, Skype, Facebook Messenger, Steam, Sony, and text all those work on my phone when the power is out. I am pretty sure if I was playing with a group and say we were on teamspeak I would be hopping on to give the heads up. 
---
I also know at one point the team I was playing with had 3 people of 8 in the same house all being brothers. So yes it does happen while that is not 4 of 5 it is still 3 players that we would lose all at once which is one less then 4. I also have a friend I have been gaming with that has last I checked six different people actively gaming in their house and there is times most of them are playing the same game together.
---
Because people would ask for ascended gear only or berserker gear for pdps only and ppl who don't have it would go to the forums and complain about it.
---
&gt;Idk why people are down voting you for agreeing
---
Reddit is a *strange* place
---
Well Weaver suffers because of a different problem. (The rather weird start to the rota + rather high toughness)
---
I think you haven't tried assembing a team recently :3

If you did you'd see that Anet didn't joke in that update post like a half a year ago, when they said they're nerfing ele because a good weaver deals 6x more dmg than a casual one.

My dad started GW2 around a year ago and has a level 80 engineer and a level 20 ranger, but when I visited him last week I found out that he's been clicking all of his skills! He told me that he wants to switch to keybinds but can't press his utility skills on 6-0 in combat. And he hates modifier keys too -- he doesn't like to "press multiple keys at once." So I came up with this layout and taped this chart to his desk.

Let me know if anyone has ideas about improving or simplifying this layout!

Thank you!

Because cancer builds are OK on anything, but a tanky engi that deals no damage is just too OP for the world, even when it does have counter classes...

I'm sure having the time of my life with my scrapper now, messing around with those stupid mesmers.

Of course scrapper needs LITTLE tweaks to be balanced, but we know how ANet's "balance" work.

Oh you are right. My brain doesnt even bother to remmeber that. There is always so much of it anyway so I will never notice. 
---
You better moove your ass
---
Ranger for sure.
---
Sadly, Steve (Slurms) passed away last night. Our little gaming community is devastated. He was one of the nicest, smartest and funiest guys I've ever had the pleasure of knowing.
---
i hope your dad is a pianist
---
Most keypads i see have 28+ keys. And far as the G700, That is way more than I am willing to pay for a mouse when I am a casual pve player
---
Why not? Choya are just watermelon with feet! LOL
---

---
Thanks! Of course I ran across the FAQ two min after posting. /eyeroll  That was after 10 min of searching and finding nothing lol
---
what about mouse key binds, I have them for inventory, map, raptor mount and backflip.
---
I'd be interested to see some of your logs
---
have you tried giving him an mmo style mouse, having the 12 keys on the side is a great help for this
---
It's funny you mention that, since he actually does play piano.
---
I use the Razer Orbweaver and my gf the Tartarus v2. But if I had to choose I would go for the Tartarus v2.  
---
Nevertheless I am very happy the Orbweaver. And both have all that gaming software that razer provides with the color effects, profiles, macros...  
---
I will never play on a keyboard again!
---
well that is true and our character isn't necessarily human either xD
---
well in gw2 we haven't seen a human, charr, sylvary, asura or norn absorb the power yet, but that doesn't mean it isn't possible (shown in gw1). Also when we killed or then they died no one from our party tried to absorb the power.
---
M8, are you telling me he needs to press ZXCV while moving to use his utility/elite skills?
---
Atm i use 1-5 for weapon skills f1-f5 for profession skills and Q/ERT/C for heal/utility/elite. Professions with F4 and F5 skills are rough to use but otherwise it allows you to reach everything with ease.
---
Since he uses engineer that may not be the best layout, but probably better than swapping kits with ZXCV. :P
---
Couldn't agree more :) 
---
Well you don't need multiple characters if you have the build templates add on, but I don't think you take into account the issue that plagues OW which is people want to play a role and are only good at that role. 
---
Just because someone can swap to a support doesn't mean they will do well. 
---
If I go necro for example but my team needs someone to hold down a point instead and they all ask me to switch. We are fucked because it forces people into play roles they don't normally play.
---
Take one look at OW and it is always a shit show in character select. 
---
Thanks, I was looking at Tartarus v2 since it is the suggested replacement for the Nostromo 
---
Or the LM30 for less than 1/3 of the price.
---
I use a Logitech g602 and I really like it. However, the buttons, while I really like the way they are formatted, aren't super straightforward like the Razer mice and might take him a bit of getting used to. But I find it very comfortable.
---
NSP currently has a lot of pugs and only a few tags (which tag at NA Prime).  Its usually a FFA until primetime.
---

---
I find those mice to be more complicated than they're worth. I've got two buttons and i'm always mixing those up already!
---
¯\_(ツ)_//¯
---
&gt;  What is Anet going to do, ban them all?
---
Mute them for 24h
---
The typical pugs don't realize their [insignificance and ignorance](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aqcugo/im_never_raiding_again/eggoo4t/?context=2). Your "kp" pings and titles means absolutely NOTHING.
---
Care to drop some links for those keypads?
---
You can bind special keys too. Shift, Control and Alt give you +6 keyboards. 
---
I'd recommend using an mmo mouse too. 
---
Here's some examples:
---
* Dodge on middle mouse button.
---
* Swap weapons on mousewheel tilt.
---
* All skills on the mouse keypad.
---
* All special keys on mouse-shift + mouse keypad.
---
* Mounts in Shift + Z,X,C,V,etc
---
* Novelties is Shift+Ctrl + + Z,X,C,V,etc
---
* Q to mout.
---
* E for special action. 
---
* R to autorun. 
---
* Ctrl+R to toggle walk. 
---
* Ctrl+Q to use selected novelty.
---
* On Shift alone put Swim down, Second mount skill and Toggle ground target. They do not interfere with each other since it's impossible to use all 3 at the same time.

---
https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lag-Free-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B00E4MQODC/ This is the mouse I have and I love it. I've bound all my mounts to the mouse buttons along with my heal &amp; special action key which frees up keys for other things. I do swap out buttons depending on the class/role I'm playing but that's easy enough to do in gw2 :)
---
Guild Wars: Eye of the North to unlock the hall and a few achievements to get the points. However, you will need Guild Wars: Factions, Nightfall and Prophecies to unlock all of the achievements.
---
Just remember to write this also on 4chan and maybe myspace for better visibility.
---
As was said, EOTN is required to do the linking to GW2.  Beyond that, I really recommend getting the collection that includes the core game, Nightfall, and Factions.  This is because they give you access to heroes, which you are absolutely going to want if you get into GW1 at all.  Heroes enable a lot of solo-play.
---
Personally I prefer my dodge on C or V to make it much easier to dodge-jump. SAB is coming soon.
---
While I like the core idea of "make tracking Raid experience more reliable," the issue with this idea is that it is based on a fundamentally flawed assumption: that the design purpose of the items we use as KP is to indicate how experienced a player is at raiding. LIs and Boss Tokens were not implemented into the game as a means to gauge player experience, but as resources for crafting Legendary Armor and Guild Hall decorations respectively. "KP" as a concept in GW2 was invented by the community, not the game's designers, and them adjusting the items we use for that purpose to better suit that purpose would open a massive can of bad-game-design worms.
---
The basic principle is this: under virtually all circumstances, the metagame should be informed by the balance of the game, not the other way around. This is because as soon as the developers decide to take a certain aspect of the meta as a given, it essentially stops being part of the meta and becomes an actual mechanic of the game, which is rarely a good thing. For example, suppose that rather than trying to balance Support Chrono against other Support specs, the devs decided to essentially give up and design future Raid content under the assumption that all squads will have at least one Support Chrono in them. This could potentially lead to mechanics that are fundamentally impossible in some way or other without a Chrono (a debuff that you need to use Continuum Shift to remove, for example), and suddenly things have gone from "serious Raid groups will almost always have a Support Chrono" to "you literally *cannot* clear this Raid without a Support Chrono," and I don't think anyone wants that.
---
This is an extreme example, obviously, but the fundamental principle is the same for any less-contentious aspect of the meta in any game mode, Raids or otherwise. By adjusting things like LIs and Tokens based on the idea that "these items are used to track a player's Raid experience," even slightly, that statement becomes an *actual game mechanic* rather than a loose community standard that can be ignored by anyone who wants to, and can find nine other people who agree with them of course. It would actively discourage players from using the items for their intended purposes, and that's just sloppy game design. To be fair, I completely agree that we need better ways of assessing how experienced at Raiding a player is, but canonising part of the meta is probably the worst possible way to do it. Something akin to Mastery level but exclusive to raiding would probably be a better solution, although in the long therm any system that relies on a finite number is going to eventually break down. The only perfect solution would be to implement a proper party finder, and unfortunately that just doesn't work in the game that GW2 is today.

/salute
---
Maybe with a crap ton of supply from a full squad an airship could be a mount assembled at spawn complete with cannons.
---
I mean who’s firing at me at SMC?
---
I assume you mean the blue circle under the feet which comes from the elite signets passive effect. 
---
I just want to put my basic key bonds out there:
---
Q for heal skill, E R T for utilities, Z for elite, mouse 4 for weapon swap, 1-5 are the same.
---
I started raiding with a guild and didn't know the decorations would be used as KP for pugs. Over 100 LI later my guild stopped raiding and I don't have a single KP because I just kept double-clicking them (since I didn't need them...).
---
Now I get punished for investing my decorations into the guild (where they belong...) instead of saving them as KP :/
---
Heh. Clockwork orange. 
---
Really sad. I always enjoyed the orrator. Given the enthusiasm put into those posts I can understand the very kind  twitter comments. My condolences.
---
yet companies regularly stipulate a number of years of experience for potential applicants, because while it may not be 100% accurate, it's still a very good indicator. the same goes for killproofs - some may cheat the system, some may be bad despite a lot of kills and some low KP players may be good, but these are the exceptions, not the rule. the whole system of using KP is imperfect, but still far better than wasting cumulative hours letting anyone join and having to get rid of them, then losing the good players because they get bored or annoyed and so forth. especially since while waiting for a group to fill, people can do other stuff on the side, but if they constantly have to refill the group, not only can't they do anything while waiting, their potentially quite expensive food runs out as well. 
---
No, shitty entitled pugs demanding everyone caters and revolves around them is bad for the game mode and people are simply doing whatever it takes to deal with their bullshit. 
---
Plenty of negatives in wvw are a direct consequence of this. 
---
I was going to talk about two of my ideas, but I ended up redesigning the warclaw as well (now called the panther). I added a few notes about mount roles too.
---
**Panther**
---
* Medium speed, medium health.
---
* Skill 1: Leap at enemies. Finishes downed enemies. Dismounts the player.
---
* Skill 2: Grappling Hook, pulls enemies, dismounting them as well. Can be dodged. Consumes supply with every use.
---
* Skill 3: Turn Disabling Hook on/off. Disables siege weapons, but locks you to them, forcing you to stick nearby. Dismounting or moving too far disables the hook. Consumes supply while it's active.
---
* Dodge: Leap forward. Three endurance bars.
---
* Special: Your mount can swim.
---
**Dolyak**
---
* Slow speed, high health.
---
* Skill 1: Charge forward moving the horns, launching enemies in your path. Finishes downed enemies. Dismounts the player.
---
* Skill 2: Headbutt a nearby gate. Consumes supply with every use.
---
* Skill 3: Turn Shield Bubble on/off. Can be used while moving. Consumes supply while it's active.
---
* Dodge: Gain stability, and become invulnerable to dismounts. Two endurance bars.
---
* Special: You can load supply into your dolyak, letting you deliver it wherever you want. The supply will be lost if you dismount.
---
**Moa**
---
* Fast speed, low health.
---
* Skill 1: Slash at a single target repeatedly. Finishes downed enemies. Dismounts the player.
---
* Skill 2: Applies reveal and marks nearby enemies on the world map. Consumes supply with every use.
---
* Skill 3: Turn stealth on/off. Consumes supply while it's active.
---
* Dodge: Greatly increases your movement speed, roller beetle levels. One endurance bar.
---
* Special: Your mount detects WvW traps.
---
**Additional notes:**
---
* You can only equip one mount at once. To swap mounts, you need to go back to the respawn.
---
* Forced dismounts, either by using the attack skill or enemy attacks, ouput the mount on cooldown for 30 seconds.
---
* Trap redesign, now they have 20 charges each, consuming 1 every time an enemy steps inside. New trap, dismounts enemy players.
---
&gt;This, since kp can be faked, could be fixed by adding a command like /kp [boss] or something, which would return name of the boss with number of kills you got on him.
---
To be fair this either would still not help you know if someone is garbage or not but it would indeed be a step closer to it (especially if you can count all the kills and not just 1 per week).
---
But then again having killed a boss X times may not mean you are not meh/garbage and a number of boss kills remains an imperfect metric (but still miles better than using decorations).
---
Oh I get it. You made a meme. Took me more googling than it probably should have.
---
Thanks for the excellent breakdown.
---
So while I am wrong about the details, I am still right about the overall issue, being that it brings too much stealth with no tells.
---
Were they actively not attacking or something?
---
I have a hard time you’d get that low with the boons available in most any raid group. 
---
As other people said you'll need any of the 3 base campaign + Eye of the North.
---
Once you get to Eye of the North, message me here and I'll hook you up with minis.
---
Oh no, that's horrible! The Orrator was always a fun read. I'd wondered what had happened to him :( 
---
Get the G600. If your dad finds it is too heavy, search up on YouTube on how to remove the two weights that are inside of it. You will need to buy new mouse feet if he wants to remove the weights, but all-in-all the mouse+feet should cost you less than $50.
---
I know a lot of people will argue that GW2 doesn't warrant the use of an MMO mouse, but there is no way I would have made it to Plat if I had to play DDR with my left hand. The ability to have unhindered directional movement will not only increase your dads ability to play but also the enjoyment of his experience.
---
G600 all day.
---
Is that at xx:45 every hour?
---
So *that's* how you place markers!
---
Turns out he just wanted to use a legendary torch he crafted so just had a torch. No idea what his gear was. His arc damage skill just had torch 5 being used.
---
&gt; the issue that plagues OW which is people want to play a role and are only good at that role. 
---
Mirages before the patch, and scrappers after the patch?
---
Let's not pretend we don't already have those problems, but worse.
---
Could be a transmog. 
---
And no rotating keys? How do you rotate in combat while the mouse is busy targeting AoE? :I
---
Water overload also provides 10 man cleanse, regen and vigor... so if you really want those theres options there as well. 
---
He said that cause it's a third party application not officially endorsed by anet. As for the tool deleting gear delta said it was more of a joke than anything else.
---
I know this is about PvE, but man, do Eles have it rough in PvP too! When HoT dropped and chronobunkers and scrappers were making fights snorefests where you could literally have a game without a single kill or death, eles had a Tempest healing build, that was basically just a heal-btch for the chronobunkers and scrappers for their downtime, no damage, no utilities, just raw healing. Anyways, time passes, ele's base values on healing skills get reduced, some ratios reduced too... then they actually nerf what was wrong, the chronos and scrappers, but they forgot to buff eles back up.
---
Fast forward 3 years into the future, eles have no viable damage build, no viable support build in PvP, just a self-healing-wet-noodle-decap-troll weaver build and all because they way they set up our traits and weapons and scalings, we can only have one thing at a time..... meanwhile marauder or paladin soulbeasts/spellbreaker/holos get full heals while dishing their own share of pain. 
---
Staff tempest is fun, but man, when I play other classes and get to do crazy trait combos, I wonder if there is anyone at Anet who plays eles  at all :/
---
A good FB nearly never uses tome 1. You are confirming with each of your replies that you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
What do STAB and Bomb mean in WvW? I hear people call it out, but I don’t know what they are referring to.
---
That's ele for you. More complex than any other class for no real reason (gtfo with your 2012 arguments) and does less than any other class. I'd rather play druid and be braindead than actually experience some form of gameplay. /s
---
I had a heal firebrand who swapped to dh and did less dps than before. I was really curious about his gear.
---
Agreed. On technical QOL changes.
---
I think it's sad you need to hide your tag to be able to do a closed raid at this point in the game. However it's better than not having closed raids not open for anyone to join at all. And personally I think many players dislike the idea of raids that aren't open for them to join. 
---
&gt;Black Citadel Abandoned Cave.. of Flame Legion. So called access prohibited. Yet bunch of flame shirne still active.
---
That's from the Personal Story, the father storyline.
---
J-... Just torch?
---
No scepter or axe? Not even a sword?
---
Did he at least double tap 4?
---
Please man, you gotta give me some peace...
---
Where did I say he does? You can do a quick 3, 5 and come out. Extra damage isn't anything to scoff at.
---
Damn, pulling out the insults now since you don't have a point otherwise?
---
The future of raids and their viability with the recently downsized ArenaNet is uncertain, so here comes the raid community with another attempt to make their club smaller and less inclusive (and advertise to everyone how exclusive it already is, discouraging people from joining). Let's see how that works out for you...
---
Between the WvW players and their "muh gamemode" complaints about the Warclaw and all the new players it attracted and consistent posts like this, GW2's communities are their own worst enemies.
---
MMO Gaming Mouse would make things so much more comfortable. 
---
I couldn't imagine myself playing MMOs with a regular mouse anymore. It's just too good. 
---
So this can only currently be loaded, together with ArcDPS ?
---
I guess the potential performance increases, are worth it, compared to the visual benefits from gw2hook, but hopefully it get's supported in the future.
---
*Screams in emo forest dweller*
---
I have seen a lot of shitty scrappers trying to abuse how good it is and players have already adapted. 
---
I think you are glorifying the thought of free swapping when in reality it causes more issues than it solves. In OW all it takes is one person unwilling to switch to fuck you over. 
---
Swapping between class builds is fine, but swapping to a different class is stupid beyond belief. 
---
At that point it just becomes a hardware race. 
---
Don't get mad at me because you don't know how to gear or play a FB lol. You literally contradicted yourself in your last post.
---
&gt; About the prot though, it's incredibly unrealistic (imo) largely because it assumes that people are in your overload earth for the entire duration. 
---
Sure, but you still have two SoI bots flying around.
---
Hey, bugs can happen from patch to patch. Better to be safe than sorry.
---
So true...
---
But some wrong idea :  
---
\- you can already cap prot without earth
---
\- you can cap fury with fire
---
\- air is for speed (even if you already cap it only with 4 in air)  
---
example (tempest heal fire/water/temp) :

Logitech has a great option. Personally I use the Razor Naga (wired). I've heard people say Logitech is more reliable, but I've used my Naga for 8 years ($80 when I got it) without a single issue.   
---
But yeah I would HIGHLY recommend using a mouse with a number pad on it :) 
---
A logitech g600 + keypad such as a Nostromo or Tartarus is a game changer, if not overkill, imo.
---
But yes, G600 series mice are tops.
---
Had a look at the offence to be extra certain. Found there was a second name linked to this, too, where the known pattern for forced name changed and suspensions comes into play.
---
This is the deal: If you break the naming policy for the first time, we simply flag the name. You log in, you get to rename it yourself. No suspension, no forced rename, nothing. We give everyone that oen freebie. Heck, sometimes, we even do that in a second offence. 
---
After that, however, if the name is changed again to something offensive, we feel that our previous flags have been ignored. In that case, we force a name change to a name we pick (by use of an anagram, if possible) and add a suspension. 
---
Since there have been previous chances to fix the issue themselves, we then do not offer to pick a name for free again.
---
This is a list of links to comments made by ArenaNet employees in this thread:

As long as they keep the Unbound Magic ones the same, I'm happy. Unless they standardized the 4-hit mining and lumbering tools, and the 3-hit-in-one gathering tool.

Congrats, astralaria is a fine choice indeed. It was my very first legendary as well, it is still my favorite legendary (although i do have size envy, anet please make astralaria just a tiny bit bigger).
---
Now you have to embark on the journey of many next legendaries :)
---
If you don't care about rank you're just denying yourself more rewards doing it off season. 
---
I never said power, I said Power **Damage**. The scaling on staff and mace skills is quite low. Burning never changes it's scaling, so it's always the highest scaling condi damage. Both are wasted stats but Playguedoctors is better since it brings you three other useful stats.
---
But you initially made a point about the condi damage, whereas I made a point the statline was a good suggestion.
---
Use that code to purchase a lower case N.
---
Thank you for the enthusiasm! Actually, a module is probably one of the best ways to describe what this would be close to. And no, things won't fit prefectly, because one is for an mmo. However, this could be better because there would be room for lots of creative freedom on the part of the gm.
---
In regards to classes - yes. There will be at least some minor alterations, but of course optional. Realistically, I'd like to make some new classes that fit in decently well with current vanilla ones, but that give the uniqueness of guild wars. In addition, I'll probably have a blurb talking about simple conversations in the event people don't want to learn new classes, or want to attempt building their own.
---
For the Eden... I actually don't know what you're referring to, but if it could be used as a sort of initiation, I'm all down to learning about it! Thanks for the tip!
---
Yup. And it still sits in that location as non instanced location. For reason beyond us.
---
I have a feeling you should wait for [ .....](https://youtu.be/SEsBYtjsGGI?t=214)
---
Yeah, it feels like two problems.
---
One one hand; "most pugs" refuse to respect closed raids, and *will* swarm once they find you even if there's no tag visible - they'll target someone for visibility and just follow anyway. That's, to your point, disrespectful, but not preventable.
---
On the other; closed raids are fine, but *hidden* raids never felt like a good thing to me, because (especially if I'm pugmanding for example), it means i have even fewer ways to know what kind of support or other assets are on the map, and it makes community interaction so much more difficult.
---
There are benefits and issues with any kind of organization, though, so there's no way to say purely which is Actually The Best Way to handle this stuff.
---
The traid of is that druid is a trash healer while tempest busted as fuck.
---
Depends on the builds just like with two of any other class.
---
Yea that would never happen in your dreams. The engine is hella old. They can't even manage live updating class specialization icons without closing the scoreboard and opening it again. You think they can manage live updating complete character information? Hah. 
---
I have a mouse like that but for some reason I cannot bind some of the buttons =/
---
I’m still running GW2Hook, although I’m contemplating swapping over. Given the low clock, high core count, double GPU nature of my machine, I believe I could see some possible performance improvements from it. 
---
:'(
---
I have never seen my keybind layout ever being recommended and it's weird because it's too easy, so I'll mention it since it might help people.
---
*  1-5: weapon skills
---
* Shift + 1-5: utility skills
---
* Q, E, R, Shift-Q, Shift-R, Shift-E: Profession skills
---
I think you can bind professions skills to Ctrl+[key] for more ease as well.
---
This way you have the entire rest of the keyboard to keybind anything.
---
Out if curiosity what's wrong with permanently using action camera? After playing blade and soul which uses a similar camera style I absolutely love it.

Logitech g600, roccat nyth and corsair scimitar pro. Don't buy the razer, too fragile.

If your dad writes a lot on pc, you might consider moving the movement direction keys one to the right. To take advantage of [touch typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing). W/A/S/D to E/S/D/F.

---
Basically the issue with it in GW2 is that it heavily restricts your flexibility in interacting with the combat system since it's ultimately a retrofit, not the intended design. There's a lot of things that you can't do with action combat enabled.
---
You can't drop aoes in any location other than center camera. This means you can't use look-behind and drop aoes behind you, drop them to the sides while moving in a different direction, nor is it easy to lead targets with aoes while chasing them.
---
You can't rotate the camera freely to get extra views while moving in a specific direction. You have some ability to move in the non-look direction, but it's heavily restricted.
---
Targeting against complex targets like mesmers or vs a group where you want a specific target can be extremely difficult. While you can still tab through targets to an extent, it locks off a whole portion of the targeting system and makes it very hard to select just the Mesmer, or just 1 squishy in a cloud of enemies.
---
There's other things that action combat makes more difficult or impossible in GW2, but those are a few big ones off the top of my head. If you plan PvE only, it's probably not a huge deal, but if you're doing PvP, WvW, or even just high tier fractals or raids, it'll start being a detriment to your play.

For someone with somewhat small hands I prefer to have QERFCX as skill keybinds. I then use 1-5 for niche cooldowns. This also makes it way easier to dance around with WASD. Just make sure A and D are set to strafe and not rotate. This goes for any MMO.
---
What do you mean?
---
Yeah, when I made Nevermore I crafted probably 150 of them and will probably do the same for Astralaria. Good tip on the coral!
---
I personally have Shift+A and Shift+D bound to rotate, but I don't use them much honestly. I use the "Fast with Range Indicator" setting, so ground targeting is pretty quick for me.
---
But your keybinds sound good too, especially in PvP when that extra mobility is crucial.
---
In your mouse's manager, say you bnd button #12 to Shift+E. Then you go to GW2 and bind, for example, your heal skill to Shift+E. That way it should then react to your mouse button #12.
---
Still have to equip them but yeah. Some people put dummy ones there then switch them out before logging by double tapping on the dummy ones. 
---
I offered to let him kill me but then our deadeye shot him in the back of the head.
---
Like WTF dude, read the chat.
---
Oh damn, how did you read the smallest text? Tried myself but got stumped

&gt;STAB: stability
---
As a thief main who only played for warclaw, I feel very, very dumb right now.
---
I use Shift + letter key for each of my mounts. I've had to shuffle a few controls around that I don't use too often, but it works with the setup I've got where I can access everything with my left hand. Shift + A for Jackal (Anubis), Shift + S for Springer, Shift + D for Beetle (I think of Initial D), Shift + Z for Skimmer, Shift + X for Raptor, Shift + C for Griffon, and Shift + V for Warclaw.
---
Keeping just one key for the modifier helps keep me from getting confused and dancing around my keyboard ineffectually. That way I can just look dumb in combat. :P
---
This might be a good place to ask this question. I've been playing guild wars 2 for many many years but my girlfriend has never played an MMO. I've been thinking of maybe getting her an account and then she and I could level together from the beginning.  
---
What I'm wondering is this; What's the level 1 to 80 experience in guild wars 2 like these days. When I login I'm confronted with multiple characters spanning across all professions, all of them fully decked out in ascended gear, Max bags with about 5 million pieces of equipment and different knickknacks. It can easily be a bit much even for me.  
---
So what is the starting experience like these days? Is Living story still a thing? Do you have to buy additional story pieces? How long until gliding and mounts? What's the best way to usher someone in?
---
Say what? Addons to gw2?
---
Holosmith/engineer has a bit of "quick, activate me now!" abilities, sometimes they're your profession skills (ex: super speed or suprise shot) and other time they're your utilities. It's indeed a bit rough to keybind for them.
---
If he's not used to a keyboard a mouse with side buttons is the strictly superior choice, it's a huge pain for more experienced people tho (which is why i only use 1 side button lol).

 Sad news(
---
Not quite related, but I bought a mechanical Red Dragon keyboard, with completely circular keys &amp; whose model name is weird &amp; I don’t recall off-hand, and it is so solidly constructed (with aluminum body) &amp; responsive for the last 21 months of ownership, that when I buy a KB again, it’ll be another Red Dragon (of whatever model line is available at that time) 
---
Also, the KB software for customization of RGB profiles is lightweight in terms of its resource needs, but user-friendly in every function.
---
tl’dr - If Red Dragon KB’s are any indicator of utility, endurance, cost-effectiveness, and robust construction, then a Red Dragon mouse would be a sound purchasing decision.
---
I'm not sure if he'd think it's too complicated or anything, I mean I don't but I game constantly. I find ctrl/alt/shift to be great for a lot of functions especially hotbars, for example I have ctrl+\[1 through 5\] bound to the secondary bar used for class skills, keeps my hand on the left of the keyboard not trying to do a hunt/peck or reaching way out of range to the F keys, and since the icons are linear on the screen I figure 1-5 kinda has a logical look and feel to it. It's also good for buttons later in your bar you may not stretch to as easily but I guess that doesn't look and feel as nice I've got shift 1-4 for 7 to 0 on the hotbar since my fingers don't stretch too far
---
I'm very happy with my G13, but I haven't tried Razer's keypads, only their mice 5+ years ago.
---
I'd strongly recommend the corsair scimitar. It is durable and is pretty much just a better naga all around.
---
Warning: the software (Corsair Utility Engine) is doo doo. It has all the functionalities you need. It just sucks. More specifically, the UI sucks. You will want to help your dad figure it out.
---
However, I haven't regretted my purchase yet. I got it to replace my Razer naga about two or three years ago. I'd gone through two nagas in two years. This mouse is great.
---
I use it for FPS games. All my games. I can't go back. Even if you don't get a Scimitar, trust me, you'll never be able to go back to using number keys on your keyboard. It actually makes a big difference. You never have to stop moving to use abilities, switch weapons, or do whatever else the game may ask of you. It makes a huge difference in FPS's, and it certainly helps mobile DPS.
---
Oh, I definitely love the layout. It got really difficult to use when I switched to FFXIV. I have to go from button 2 to buttons 7, 8 and then back across to 2 and back to buttons 11 and 12...
---
I’ve seen the grub loads, but never the oakhart :(
---
Rytlock.  
---
Love his stubbornness!
---
I feel like I heard about the alliance update more than a year ago and it's crazy that it's still not out.
---
I actually like Trahearne's. After all these years. :'(
---
Wait you can keybind clear target? I thought you had to click on the ground to untarget something
---
For real, just Google the shit
---
Thanks for this :) sometimes it's difficult to read pics on mobile.
---
Holy shiet, those are MUCH higher resolution than the copies of the asset in Amnoon i tried to translate.

---
When I assign keybinds I try to keep all my "in combat" keys within easy reach of my movement keys which results in using a maximun distance of 2 keys from my movement keys.
---
With that in mind, in order to maximise the number of usable keys I prefer to use E-S-D-F for movement instead of A-S-D-F. This allows me to use the keys on the left part on the keyboard untill I reach the "line" formed by F4-6-Y-H-B. (with A-S-D-F for movement the liminting line is F4-5-T-G-V). This setup allows use of keys W andA for skills that are used in combat. 
---
I also try to not move my arm and only stretch my fingers for keypresses, which means that the use of X and C is not very convenient.
---
I didn't know you could bind the windows and function(?) keys (I mean the keys between control and alt).
---
_______________
---
My keybinds are:
---
ESDF: Movement
---
W/R/T/G/H: Skills 1-5
---
A: Heal Skill
---
Q/V/B: Utiliy Skills
---
Z: Elite Skill (I want it on an "unconvenient" key so that I don't accidentaly hit it, since it's usally a long cooldown)
---
2/3/4/5/6: Proffession skills
---
X and C: dodge (for cases where I want to dodge backwards)
---
1: special action
---
mouse wheel click: swap weapon
---
I have a mouse with 2 side buttons which i use for dodge (you can use double tapping if you want, but it's slower) and about face.
---
Since your father said that he doesn't like to press multiple keys at once, I suggest a mouse key for dodging because that way maybe he will get used to directional dodging (dodging forward or to the sides). If you don't have a mouse with extra keys I would propose binding dodge to the mouse wheel clikc and use keys for weapon swap and about face.
---
______________________________________________
---
I hope that this may give you an idea or two about how you could improve your layout in case your dad doesn't like it.
---
He might like using an MMORPG mouse like a razor naga. The key pad is easy to visualize on the side because it’s layed out exactly like a number pad.

Most people in Europe organise it 14/03/2019, which leaves you without a satisfying pi.
---
I've never understood why people don't organise things yyyy/mm/dd, just like we do for hh:mm:ss (largest unit first), it really helps with computer sorting because 20190314 doesn't need to be reformatted to numerically sort it, *and* you get pi every year. It truly is the best of both worlds.
---
You mean I don't have to rely on 7 years of Piano Lessons to fight in GW2? Revolutionary!
---
(In all seriousness, I wish more players would post these set ups. GW2 efficiency? Is that something you can get from the API or is it client side?)
---
THANKS!!!
---
Honestly what I'd like them to do instead would be allowing you to customise your field priority for each finisher type.  Because I know plenty of Guardians that would much rather any Blasts they do be working off of a Fire field instead of their own Light fields, same with Necros and the few Blasts they have (IIRC it's just one Staff skill and that one Minion that does two Blasts?).  But that's probably a very low priority QoL feature.
---
Way back then you needed to complete certain tasks to unlock traits and one grandmaster trait was unlocked by killing it. Thats when i say it killed, never ever ive seen the grub killed
---
I don't know what mouse you use, but if you use logitech mouse you have to download the program on the website. I imagine it would be the same for other brands.
---
Just get him a Logitech G502 and he can bind all his key skills to his mouse . 
---
they have been avoiding uw content for a long time. A shame really because it was awesome, unbalanced but awesome
---
if they try full 3d combat again, i would rather have aerial combat. it would be a new thing for masteries and the next XPAC
---
so 2, 4 and 5 mix
---
That sucks so bad. He was a well known community member -- and even if he wan't -- death takes you just like that. Such is the mortality of our frgile lives.
---
r/punpatrol?
---
Rathalos....is that you?
---
I have a g600 and a g602
---
I don't recommend a g602 to OP if he is going to play mmo/gw2 for several reasons.
---
* g602 is more expensive than g600
---
* There is 6 buttons on the side. 2 buttons for heal + elite, 4 button left for f1-f4. But f5 is left. g600 has more buttons to place. 
---
Can it also come in a pepega skin for my guild?
---
you should have received codes in an email, you redeem those codes on the website
---
Check your email. What's everything has processed properly, you'll receive an email with codes for the expansions. You apply those to your account on the GW2 website, and that will activate the expansions
---
It's a little known fact that pressing "Lock Autotarget" when you already have a target will clear your current target.
---
I don't know about yours, but my windows PC has four buttons to the left of space: Ctrl, Fn, Win, and Alt.
---
Raids are level 80 and require HoT for Wings 1-4 and PoF for Wing 5. 
---
Yep, it's a little known fact that pressing "Lock Autotarget" when you already have a target will clear your current target!
---
The others have answered your question but I'm gonna add something. It can be that for a few days you still have some restrictions even after applying the Expansion serial codes to your account. Those will only last a few days. This is to prohibit gold sellers to activate an account and quickly refund the game to damage the games economy etc. 
---
Currently I login and do T4s and my daily, but after that I don't have much to do.  I am still relatively new.
---
What farms/activities should I focus on daily?  Specifically things I can get done in a relatively short time (20-30 minutes) that are also rewarding?
---
thx very much my dude
---
thx my dude
---
Being a Clicker is nothing bad but by doing that you train yourself a way that could be problematic if you want to increase your playstyle. Sure Clicker can be fast but its harder for them at the end then someone with keybind.
---
Its like riding a bicycle without brake. If you go slow and brake with your foot on ground everything will be fine, but if you try to go faster you could get in trouble.
---
Let just take a simple mechanics in wing 1. Sabetha bombs need to be throw in a 5 seconds windows otherwise you lose it and team fail the mechanic. So you will need to notice you get the bomb (4 seconds left), reposition your mouse on Special Action key (3.5sec left), notice and go where the bomb need to be throw (2.5-1.5 sec left) and click special action skills + ground target the bombs location. 
---
In this process, you lose easilly 1 second just by being a clicker and it give you less reaction time to achieve the mechanic.
---
Btw some combo couldn't be achieve without proper keybind.
---
Hey! That's awesome to hear about your progress - I'd love to see how you made some of your classes. Currently, this is for GW1, but some of your stuff could easily be used in the project. Later on when everything is complete for GW1, I would like to move to GW2.
---
That being said, if you want to help out and/or contribute in any way, you are more than welcome! Anything helps :)
---
&gt;	I do have a Logitech moose
---
How much does it eat?
---
How big are the antlers?
---
Is the fur soft?
---
Can you put a saddle on it and ride it around?
---
I would wait to see if you like the game before buying the expansions, you get a couple of restriccions like trading in tp or using global chat but nothing else.
---
With the expansions you get new maps to explore.
---
In this game it's really easy to find random groups of people to play with, since all the maps have events you will always find someone doing them.
---
There is also the lfg tool, very helpfull!
---
Its alive! Muahaha.. wait is it really alive? *Oh my..*.
---
Man, this voice line I will never forget.
---
I just spent way too much buying and trying different mice.
---
I think I've finally settled on the Roccat Leadr, which I really like for both having gobs of buttons and also not resorting to the numpad-like grid like many, which I tried but often get lost on.
---
I tried the Logitech G602 and Roccat Nyth before the Leadr, and both work just fine but didn't suit me for one reason or another, and I'll likely box them away eventually (if you would consider buying lightly used (literally about 10 days for the 602, maybe double that for the Nyth, but the latter is wired) let me know).
---
I liked the Nyth's customizable pad, and the G602 was snappy, but with my grip, I was holding my arm in an odd position.
---
The Leadr isn't perfect, but it's really close. Like your dad, I was clicking skills, and still do sometimes (though I'm trying to fight the habit), and I hate combo keypresses. The Leadr lets me put all weapon skills, swap, special action, heal, elite, and 1 utility all on the mouse. It also has an "easy shift" which is basically a shift-click but the shift button is on the mouse.
---
I only use this feature for the F1-F5 skills, but in theory, I could use them more. I find this implementation far easier and more comfortable than the keyboard equivalent.
---
As I get used to the mouse, I may also decide to unbind keyboard 1-5, which would let me put my F skills there and avoid the shift clicks completely.
---
All of that functionality in the mouse and that still doesn't use all the buttons...in addition to the shift functionality, there's also another paddle switch in the thumb area that currently just zooms in and out, but I'd like to give such a centrally located button much more utility in the future.
---
Give those options a look!
---
\#jealous
---
My guess would be he had no idea what DH rotation was and stopped using most of his skills after swapping.
---
What? So he just suppose to write a giant eloquent sentence just because you want more words? All the context he needed was in that one word, it wasn't rude.
---
I've found that having just a couple buttons makes a huge difference without getting too complicated. My mouse has 2 extra buttons (forward/back for normal internet usage) that I've bound to the two most important survival skills: dodge and heal. Not only do I not have to worry about mashing the wrong button in the heat of the moment, but it also frees up a couple keys closer to WASD for easier use.
---
Luck beats skill by definition ^^
---
If you didn't win you wouldn't call it luck :) 
---
I like Laranthir’s. 😊
---
If we're speaking voice specifically: Canach, obviously, but also Rox before the voice actress change. Yes, I'm still annoyed by that decision. And the "No no no. We should go to the armory." guy will forever have a special place in my heart.
---
That's a poor strategy for anything more than 5-10 points because Assassin, Dervish &amp; Ritualist are some of the strongest professions in GW1 and [Gifts of the Traveler] are one of your main sources of income as a beginner GW1 player and only having 1/3 of the campaigns limits your ability to make good money (20e/week) because Nicholas rotates locations all over Tyria.    
---
Could also make an assumption that they lived in the same city, so hearing lightning from the storm and 4 of your friends DC, it's a simple guess to make. 
---
What did your group do to take care of the walking spirits during gorseval?
---
Yes, it's all true. Just Aftershock and sand squall is needed thanks to SOI and chono shield.
---
The best kind of points 
---
awesome project, we love data!
---
Or they could do the much simpler method and just make Persisting Flames grant fury when blasting in any field.
---
We send 1 dps on one spirit and tempest immo another. I think the tempest can take care of this 2 spirits but we don't want to risk it.
---
Interesting but trying to memorize that would be impossible for me. So I just press 1 thru 6 and after I have died several times I move on to a different game again. As much as I love this game the controls are so complicated I will never be able to enjoy it again.
---
All the mice buttons and keybinds suggestions listed below are great but I am not even sure what the 2 buttons on my mouse do let alone what others would do for me.
---
Hmm - I never really 'got' the  usual Q-E-R-T-Y hotkey setup some people use for MMOs, but this (as well as the radial menu addon linked in the comments) kinda adds a new perspective! I might have to experiment with keybinds nect time I log in. I like 1-through-0 because I startedbwith FFXIV, but sometimes it'd be better to try something else...
---
“Noo! Noooo....Aurene...”-that acting broke me 
---
Great stuff, thanks for the sacrifice.
---
Recently came back to the game so I have no idea - are recs "worth it" in terms of gold or are t4s+cms enough?
---
Is this a good deal :o
---
ESDF instead of WASD solved all my problems for all games I ever played. I don't get why folks stick to the crappy WASD layout.

yea no..this falls into the "you could die from a meteorite impact"

possible for sure but extremely unlikely

Just for the record, "differing playstyles" is a valid reason to kick in FFXIV.
---
"I need some space!" -player male Charr 
---
I have two secrets to share regarding key binds.
---
1) use ESDF, you will get additional 4 keys! and index finger on F (for bump) which is also nice, but this is not a big secret, most of you know it:)
---
2) the biggest secret is this: *use ALT modifier*, for multiple reasons!
---
a) your thumb almost do nothing, so you dont need to sacrifice anything. 
---
b) thumb doesnt block movement of other 4 fingers! (Pinky finger for CTRL or SHIFT totally blocks Ring and partially blocks middle finger) try simple exercise, hold SHIFT with pinky and press 12QWE with ring and middle finger, and now try same keys with same fingers while holding ALT with thumb, how do you feel?:)
---
c) you dont need to reposition your orher fingers while holding ALT, in worst case you will easily find correct hand position with index finger by finding F key!
---
There are more subtle secrets, but try these two and you'll never want to go back:)
---
As for the tip for your father try this setup:
---
Weapon skills: AQWRT
---
Utility skills:  AQWRT (with ALT)
---
Profession skills: 2345
---
there are some super convenient keys left such as GHV, feel free to assign dodge, interact or other keys depending on whats important for your daily acticities:) have fun!
---
Oh no a glasscannon got 2 shot by another glasscannon ohhh god no this is so unbalanced omg no anet pls.
---
Why is Smoke Gyro a better shadow refuge...
---
yea it's true gw2 raid pugging is filled to the brim with people buying dhuum for 120mc/week until they reach 50kp just so they can..what? leech a random run?
---
at that point they might as well chatcode it which takes 5min and costs nothing..but no, they /gg the fight 50 times and got carried instead, across a few months
---
man what's up with all these ludicruous arguments that pose absurd hypotheticals?
---
You haven't missed much, come back in another year so maybe you will have content to play for a week or two (:
---
Did you attune the rings before salvaging?
---
Great work!
---
&gt; so here comes the raid community with another attempt to make their club smaller and less inclusive
---
When I see topics like this all I think is that. They want to make it harder for people to want to do raids and thus make the small minority smaller. I really do question if people think ideas through before they post them.
---
Does anyone have any opinions on Spellbreaker vs Soulbeast for PVE content? And in terms of general fun?
---
Looking for a physical class that has solid suitability. Is Spellbreaker still a bannerslave in group content? Is Soulbeast more of a selfish DPS?
---
Define "works". You get 1.5 SoI's per CS rota, while also delaying the CS itself, so effectively 1. 1 SoI with 105s cd. Marvelous.
---
lol i do the same being OG player i dont use the 12345 buttons much i click on my skills and do very well in pvp and wvw using the click method lol I also have 502 great mouse I do bind my mouse more now on bf5 and fps shooters
---
Also in WoW you don't have to move around quite as much as in GW2, which means your mouse is more free to click instead of moving the camera.
---
Razer mice arn't bad either but **only** if you can get it on sale.  Razer charges more for the brand, they are solid quality, but not *that* solid.  
---
I keep waiting for Zojja's VA to come back. There's something great about hearing sass from such a pleasant voice. Taimi is also great, but I think Zojja needs some reference again. 
---
ah so something i didnt experience; thank god; it sounds awful
---
I'm more concerned about adding any more clutter to GW2 besides Arc and ReShade.
---
Hmmn I’m thinking of picking up infinite gathering tools for an alt. Are these worth getting? I like the animation, but I also like how speedy the consortium planty harvesty one is. (Sorry, blanking on what it’s called.) I’d heard the consortium one is the fastest due to its animation. 
---

hello, it's an unfortunate situation
---
you shouldn't be angry at commanders but at anet for not balancing a single ranger build around group wvw..it's quite sad that it's the only class that has ZERO zerg benefits
---
it's kinda like necro with pve except..competitive game modes aren't like that, they're a zero sum game
---
in order for a team to win, another has to lose
---
while in pve you can kill x boss in 5 or maybe 15min and both could be seen as "wins" and getting the job done..in actual player vs player fights somebody has to be the loser and nobody wants that so naturally the commanders attempt their best to succeed
---
it could be even argued that accepting your inferior class is unethical and "throwing"
---
again, it's very unfortunate but not the commanders' fault

I love the female charr voice, so sassy!

If you’re using the booster to hit 80, I’d recommend grabbing berserker gear and trying out some dungeons to get a feel for endgame content. To get into dungeon groups and mid - high level fractals you will need to craft ascended quality gear. Metabattle.com has a great hearing guide which will get you on your way fairly quickly.
---
It's not like you'd take less than 15k even if you had some defensive armor. You can still get 10k+ crits even on minstrel gear.
---
You're dumb, you'll die, and you'll leave a dumb corpse.

Dude - you’re cool! Wish we could play side by side on NSP. :)

Thanks, I'll check it out tomorrow &lt;3
---
Are you on NA? This seems to be mostly an NA problem. 
---
Sounds good! Let me know if it works!
---
completely RGN just 4 weeks ago, I had 1 ascended equipment dropped every night from T4s, then the last 2 weeks, I didn't have any lol. but I believe clicking boxes one after one will give you better rate than open all
---
If you use mounts to engage you can stealth from more than 5k range away. Just putting it out there. 
---
If it does give stealth to more than 5 based on others blasting, that imo should be nerfed.  Stealth in small groups (with some caveats) I am fine with but I have come to hate large group stealthing.  Fights at times are no longer be about who can actually fight better but who can stealth attack (even portal bomb) better.  Veils here, gyros there, portals close by, ugh.  
---
Does scrapper really replace FB's tho? 
---
Rytlock's VA sounds amazing even out of character. Blish was always good but after seeing his [behind the voice](https://youtu.be/cqp69nEdlFw) I was speechless. Canach and Taimi are my two big favs overall. &lt;3 Also Joko, he's voiced by Nolan North who also worked on Mordy and PC human male, but Joko's lines are particularly delightful.
---
Eir. Aside from her, mostly Asura. They tend to sound so.. plucky?

Composer of Guild Wars music is Jeremy Soule. He also composed music for Elder Scrolls series and KOTORs. Especially Oblivion tracks are similiar to GWs themes.
---
first off- great addon i used it all the time! 
---
  
---
Now, with the warclaw update. i finally updated the addon, and now all of a sudden i cant assign a key to use the addon in the first place.   
---
the roller beetle version had a clear section marked to set keybinds to use the overlay- and now there's nothing.  
---
so i am stuck with a working addon which i cant assign a keybind to and cant use.  
---
can anyone tell me if i am missing something or is it a bug?   
---
Fn is more common in laptops/netbooks (binding extra functions to F1-12) and extremely rarely on compact keyboards. 
---
The performance boost on this is impressive. I have 60 stable on nearly everything.
---
However it's been crashing for me at random intervals. Using latest available AMD drivers, latest windows update, and I made sure that both the AMD and windows overlays as well as any other are disabled.
---
The log lists the same reason every time:
---
 "PSO item are not created" | hr = 887A0005
---
is it on something on my side?
---
It is in gw2 too. They can whine about it but it doesn't stop the commander from kicking. 
---
I was actually contemplating gearing up for scrapper in WvW. May I ask what build you are using and is this build for small havoc groups or also decent in zerks?
---
Male sylvari is imo best voiced.
---
Asura male is my cup of tea though. Smartypants mixed with a hint of badassery.

Its the skin that affects the speed tbh, as the animations on the tools are tied to it. AFAIK the axes move at roughly the same speeds but the unbound tools (all of them) tend to be able to hit the same node multiple times with the same action (in the case of the sickle it'll grab the entire node plus any additional swing bonuses from item boosters/glyph of bounty if applicable). As for speed it'd have to be the Consortium Sickle skin (as it can be applied to a slower but cheaper permanent tool and still have the speed) as it has fewer animation frames than the other sickles (its pretty much a golf swing).

Did you have difficulties with the quests, or did you just feel like you ventured into the wrong area? Because it's alright to shove your nose into new places and see what you're made of. If you go too far, just back up a little, find more suitable tasks and level up a little more before going back.

Sounds like you had more fun with GW2 than WoW, plus GW2 is obviously much more economical. You probably won't get solid 60 FPS, but we do have a vivid world full of dynamic content and great people.
---
P.S. No, you don't generally need to purchase gear. Feel free to experiment with different weapons, but drops are usually good enough up until lvl 80.
---
Yeah, fair point. I've edited the reply.

"And now, to DESTROY YOU!" ;-)

Those weapon skills there would throw me off. I play an engineer too. 1-4 and R are the five weapon skills. Z,X,C,V are heal and utility skills A,B, and C respectively. Elite skill is G.  And i use a mmo mouse for the 5 profession skills. Nothing else is changed.
---
Thanks!
---
Rytlock is like a cheesy one liner machine. I love it. Plus he's voiced by Steve Blum.
---
My minstrel tempest still feels 10k+ crits from CoRs so yeah I'm with you on this.

I'm in a full support build, everything focuses around Purity of Purpose: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Purity_of_Purpose

&gt; by the time i react fast enough with my ping
---
Okay then.
---
There are tabs at the top to select the various options.

For the longest time I couldn't quite place my human necro's voice, but it sounded so familiar. Especially when she yells at Braham for doing something stupid and impulsive.
---
Then I realized her VA is also Sharon Marsh from South Park and it all made sense.
---
The starting zones in gw2 doesnt have good pathing imo. A lot of times you’ll skip hearts and go to a higher level one.
---
It's not a recent thing. The only recent thing in that regard is that anet sells that bundle on their own store now. The complete collection was released in physical 2008-2009ish already.
---
What those shops are selling are just codes from the physical versions.
---
See, I wish the female Charr sounded a bit more bestial. The male Charr is like a pack-a-day warcat, and the female Charr voice doesn't sound like it would be out of place on the norn or human.
---
Hey, no worries!
---
I remember once during a keep siege nearby him, he decided to participate and tunneled up onto the wall. Unfortunately he quickly gave up and teleported back to his spawn, but he gave us quite a surprise.
---
I have full time job, I eat and sleep properly (I'd even say I sleep a lot, I waste more time doing than than average human), but GW2 is my main free time occupation. I don't do pure farming, I never buy ingame stuff with irl money (opposite is true : I always buy gemstore stuff with irl money) so I properly crafted all my legendaries be it 1st or 2nd gen. Legendary armors come from pve raiding, I raid most of the weeks but very rarely kill bosses more than once (each week I do a clear with my static and switch account between bosses depending on which account needs some lucky drops to unlock skins), so many raiders have more (I missed a lot of weeks in the beginning). I could instantly make 1 legendary armor per account per competitive mode.
---
Which is why I never leave my house without Rune of the Scrapper.
---
Surviving them when i see isn't an issue, it is when they gank or prowl around waiting for a chance. DD and core is in a pretty good place now and i wager that DE would be too if only wasn't for the elite which literally takes one of their biggest weakness away.
---
And fix the dang glow! I don't like the flickering effect on draw :(
---
NO NO NO
---
How many hours did you think I lost trying to mount a group yet absolutely zero person joins. I don't ask for a carry since I studied the fight through, I'm only asking a chance to demark myself.
---
I still find my "rant" to be coherant with the actual thread, since not everyone will be able to get those "DATA" ammounts, due to said cause of the "rant".
---
You can do combos too. For example mine are mostly shift+1,shift+2,shift+3 etc

It'll be 2 years in June this year that I'm queuing for a CM100 LFG Daily. In all those years I only had one group to pug to attempt it. It's not be not trying to make the content happen.
---
So that's the 6th dragon, he was in plain sight all along. 
---
Weird they haven’t been added already, sad but not surprised.
---
Yes. Your goal as DH is to stack as many damage modifiers as you can, because they're multiplicative.
---
There are some really cool companies out there that allow you to make custom keyboards, or you can do it yourself if you have a way to laser-etch mechanical keys.  You need only provide a special file for it (varies by company) and they can make them for you.  This seems like a great father's day gift you could do for under $50 US.    
---
Just make sure to have the keys not super clicky, and, of course, adhere to gaming standards in regards to responsiveness and hitting many at the same time.  With how many USB ports machines have these days, you can leave them both plugged in and he would pull over this one just for GW2 and use the other for browsing, emails, etc.
---
But that's Twilight, not Dusk! :P
---
The g602 only has 6 buttons on the thumb area....
---
I have my thumb on that bottom row for utilities and dodge.  Works well.  You do not jump a lot in the game unless doing the JP because ground AoE's still hit you mid-jump.  Though, I have large enough hands (or a small enough keyboard?) to his the first four from Z-&gt; without moving my wrist or hand at all.  Might also help to be double-jointed :thinking:.
