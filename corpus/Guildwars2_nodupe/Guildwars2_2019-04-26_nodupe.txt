An Inquisitor should be dispatched to Anet headquarters, we maybe witnessing some Heresy at play. The Emperor protects.

And you don't seem to like discussion? No need to get all worked up because someone replies to youe comment with their 2 cents.
---
&gt; The other two
---
You mean shattering blow the strong condi + stab + block + reflect skill and wild blow a really strong CC that launches (=&gt; affects downed players), can hit multiple targets and gives you furry? There are 4 others apart from Headbutt and Sundering Leap btw. Blood Reckoning is probably the highest DPS increase for a heal skill in the game and Outrage is the stun break of the set.
---
If you're not using a decent monitor for gaming, you're doing your eyes a disservice regardless.
---
Best bit of advice is to follow along the story for the best learning experience. Maybe use LFG to see if any others are on the same quest as you so that you can do it together.
---
Yeah! Must be human cloning!  XD

You're a sick individual please leave my profile.

Hard no.
---
Elementalist, in my opinion one of the most fun classes. There are many many things... that you can do...
---
Honestly you probably really only need d912pxy that optimizes the game and boosts your frame rate. This will make the game run smoother and at higher res. I haven’t seen a reason using shaders with that.
---
I would say our current government sucks, and we have our own issues but we don't have children being target practised at school and good medical and benefits :) we are fine thank you!
---
This makes me so sad we can't mix and match light medium and heavy
---
Because it's way better to use political pressure to impose your preferences on others, rather than let people decide for themselves?

I don't follow your logic here.

Phrasing

You're my new favorite.
---
You can try the [builds and guide](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/870010/#Comment_870010) posted on the official forums.
---
Oh then it's just a change in a GW2 trait that used to be "Always Angry" (hence the Angry Marines jokes).
---
Just give me pets that grow and grow like 0-30% more in model size. Also remove pets that are always young like wyvern and bristleback . Give me immersion!
---
doesnt matter what power build you run. power spb also uses one assassin piece (shoulder) and rune of the thief.
---
There are multiple ways to get crit capped, it's just about what you want to sacrifice. In this case, scholar runes are the choice, since rune of the thief's modifier is pretty good. If you don't wanna rely on that modifier, throw on an accuracy sigil and rune of the eagle instead, should get you around the same duration (and I think using this you can entirely forgo the assassin piece).
---
The rune rework added a lot of viable ways to critcap using runes - infiltration, eagle and thief are all solid choices. You don't have to just throw scholar on everything anymore, which I feel is healthy.
---
In general, the "get assassins!!" thing has always been about minmaxing - finding the place where you can sacrifice the least power to critcap. It was often said that you can just run an accuracy sigil instead of some assassins pieces and the difference would barely be noticeable.
---
...and whenever you boost [the skritt goes like this](https://i.imgur.com/rvhnC08.gif).

Thanks for the time to answer, THE EMPEROR PROTECTS!
---
[removed]
---
Hey man, I'm in though that also depends on the hours. I have all classes but I can heal with either Druid or Scourge. But of those clases are fully ascended geared.
---
Same psychological trick as rotating the gemstore stock, when they could just have everything available in it all the time.
---
That indeed he does. Now go die for the Emprah, or die tryin'
---
FOR THE EMPEROR!
---
What’s the yoda armor set and dyes?
---
&gt;With this update, we're targeting a few elite specializations to receive trade-offs, and we expect to continue doing this in future updates.
---
I play evenings EST 5-10
---
Well, if we're asking for a stronger bond, perhaps the new elite could give bonuses for having the pet out, a la ranger runes. Maybe stats based on the pet, but that might be too close to slb.
---
Yup, anyone who's trying to pass off GW2 as more difficult than the trinity sub MMO's like WoW/FFXIV/etc doesn't know what they're talking about.
---
I really like Celestial gear and I have a light, medium and heavy ascended armour sets and it makes for some fun hybrid characters. Furthermore, by swapping out weapons and/or accessories, damage, healing or support aspects can be easily modified.
---
It would be great to have expertise and concentration included with the Celestial stats, but I am hopeful that a new stat set will be included as part of a future expansion or living world season.
---
The fun part is a lot of those codes got grabbed by one person with multiple accounts to sell for gold/money.
---
I dunno, you will get a lot of birthday rewards though. I do have multiple elementalists since  I main it (generally have 4 active at any one time). They all have different builds though and one is a level 45 black lion key farmer.
---
Since everyone already kind of answered the first I'll answer your edited in questions.  
---
&gt;**What are some things I should strongly consider buying from the cash shop for convenience?**
---
Copper salvageomatic - In this game you get lots of irrelevant gear that WILL clutter and completely fill your inventory easily. Salvage kits are generally used to turn these pieces of gear into materials which you can send directly from your bank from your inventory anywhere in the world thus keeping your inventory with enough space for general gameplay.
---
You might also want to eventually look for things like extra bank slots on sale (3 total is probably sufficient for a very long time if you manage correctly).
---
Look at mistlock sacntuary or any other passkey (infinite) basically gives you easy access to banks, crafting stations, shops/vendors and the trading post to buy and sell items
---
&gt;**What sort of things do I need the expansions for?**
---
Elite specialisations, extra story, masteries (mounts/gliding), living world (continual release of new maps), raids:
---
Elite specialisations are supposed to change/or add a mechanic to the class you play, along with a new usable weapon. E.G Elementalists can now use swords provided they equip the latest elite specialisation from the latest expansion. You can only equip one of these elite specialisations at a time + two base specialisations (Specialisations are unlocked at level 21 and at level 45 and 71 for a total of 3 equipable specialisations). These specialisations can be changed to whatever you want as long as you are out of combat (You are not stuck to a build path).
---
  
---
Extra story - Comes with new maps  (generally 4-5) along with the extended story line past the level 80 story of the base game. HoT and PoF both come with masteries. Masteries are kind of like a level past 80 that does not add stats but rather just adds things in the world you can interact with or other abilities such as the ability to glide or use a mount. You will need HoT to glide and you will need PoF to use a mount which are the two core masteries IMO. The others help navigation or upgrade your mount skills and abilities (E.G jump longer/higher).
---
Living World - Continual updates to the game every so often (Couple of months usually) where a new map is added along with a new mastery, generally with new stats that become obtainable along with extra storyline and a new legendary weapon.
---
Raids - HoT will give you access to the first 4 raid wings, whereas PoF will give you access to the last two (5,6), they are continually releasing raids that will be added onto and linked onto the PoF raids (I.E HoT will only unlock you 4 raid wings whereas PoF is currently set to increase in the number of raid wings it unlocks). Raids are NOT compulsory for endgame gear but can help in obtaining them. (You can play basically any gamemode, open world, PvP and WvW to obtain endgame gear, however crafting is generally required for all of them except raids). You also get endgame gear by RNG drops which are much higher in raids and PvE Fractals (high level dungeons).   
---
&gt;**When should I consider buying them?**
---
I actually acquired a set of endgame gear before even buying the expansion. I suggest leveling up to 80 on two or so characters. Making sure you have completed many events first before jumping into expansions. 
---
However, buying the expansions now also will not hurt and is actually a good idea as you get to unlock the living world story now rather than pay for it later. That way you can still play exactly the same as if you were free to play except ensuring you have unlocked as many living world episodes as possible. 
---
Some will say it's a good idea to get a mount to help navigate at a low level. I personally say it's better not to, you will understand your class more in terms of  movement skills IMO.  
---
&gt;**Any UI adjustments I should consider making? Already lowered zoom sensitivity and messed with graphics a bit to get higher FPS since I'm running on a toaster, but I know there's 3-5 things I do in WoW on every new alt.**
---
You can turn screenshake off if you want it can be annoying. You should also tick "Effect LOD" to reduce particle effects. I suggest lowering both reflections and shadows to nothing. Shadows actually still exist when turned off it's just not as good.
---
 You will also want to turn number of character models and quality of character models to at least medium if not lower. (In WvW/mass PvP I use lowest for both). It means you can't see other people's armor and fashion but it reduces a lot of lag. 
---
I would also look to change field of view to larger as well as a lot more zoomed out as you DO need to see your surroundings in this game.
---
You are also able to change your AoE targeting to smart or instant cast if it is your thing. I do NOT suggest this at the start as you won't know how large your AoE's are or how they work properly. 
---
You should also look to rebind your keys, pressing 1-0 is exactly the easiest thing to do to use your skills effectively.  
---
If you really are on a toaster, you can turn screen resolution to subsample. It'll look blurry and not so great, but will greatly reduce your lag.
---
Holosmith &amp; deadeye? xD
---
DH stomps both with 4 keys lol
---
At least you got the priorities right.
---
Necro is the easiest profession IMO right now, even in end game.
---
Power - 
---
Weaver (One target) \[Not easy to use\]
---
DH (One target + cleave) \[Best option cuz u only have to press 4keys\]
---
\------------------------
---
Condi
---
Rene condi \[Not easy to use\]
---
Mirage \[Easy to use but is not good in "all condi bosses\]
---
So you play the race card?
---
IWAY or the highway baby
---
Ah gotcha, I thought the expansion would follow after this season but looks like we've got a long way to go. Thanks!
---
Stop trying to facetank stuff. Use your dodge rolls, put sigils of energy on your weapons for extra dodge rolls.
---
Play a WvW build. Stacking some extra toughness will help you stay alive longer. 
---
Finish unlocking your elite specs. If you don't have an elite spec fully unlocked, don't equip it. You're just hindering yourself for no good reason. Stick to core builds until you get enough hero points. 
---
Join HP trains. They pop up in LFG just about every day. They make unlocking your elite specs pretty painless.
---
[Currently running this build](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?vJAQNAR3XjMdQVH25BOeAnIWICM8f8R+Jj0C6bPPjAQEonB-jBCBABGqbYjLCQXKTMa/BAeCASqE0LlWZq+T4gAgFJwqKVVVlUAmLTD-e) with my Spellbreaker. It takes a small bit of getting used to (timing full counter versus PvE enemies can be tricky as they attack so slowly) but it's really durable overall while maintaining above average damage.
---
just visually or like actually.. all i saw was an all round nerf
---
Abusing cooldown reset adrenal mushroom special action key in the testing room.
---
finally someone else who likes the change.
---
oh, ye obviously.
---
You're completely outclassed.
---
Better luck next time cupcake
---
That would both be extremely unthematic and also would remove the only uniqueness Berserk has compared to something like Death Shroud or Celestial Avatar. It's a mode that you have to dedicate yourself into using throughout its full duration, and that's what makes it unique.
---
Well, I've seen it. That's all I'm saying.

---
Is there a fractal role that's best suited for a noob?
---
i do like sword/axe more but that's totally choice of preference
---
C'mon show me that Daredevil
---
If you want to do that, then go play Reaper.
---
Bit of a stupid question but how do I actually know if it's working?
---
I don't understand what you're talking about regarding Open World since 99% of the mobs I attack are dead after 1-2 (3 if a vet) Arc Dividers.
---
Is crafting the only way to get ascended armor? or is there another way to get ascended armor that I am not aware of
---
I’d be more excited for this than endgame if it would ACTUALLY COME OUT PLEASE
---
&gt; They lock a bunch of mount skins behind, what is essentially a lootbox that gives you a random mount. Originally, that was the only way to unlock those skins.
---
it still is. there was never a mount select license added for the original batch of 30 mounts. so if you ever want a complete set of fiery / icy / celestial etc mounts you have to gamble to get whichever ones were part of the original set and not one of the subsequent sets that have selectable licenses
---
Bro i swear on my life there is no danger and it wasnt a purchase. Here is the twitter post that i was able to get the code from  [https://twitter.com/Alienware/status/1121081372452499459](https://twitter.com/Alienware/status/1121081372452499459)
---
Codes should never be posted publicly. Anyone can now contest ownership of the account that this code gets applied to.
---
To others browsing.  Do NOT use this code.  It’s not worth risking your account.
---
Wait is that really possible? I will take the post down immediately if that is true.
---
Worst case scenario is someone uses it and someone else tries to social engineer away their account in one year.  Then anet locks the account up for good if they can’t determine who the true owner is.  Do not post codes publicly.
---
Even the GW2 Client is trying its best to save us from that abomination of a promotion.
---
Yes.  Look up the yogscast threads from 2018.
---
I'm sorry to rain on your post, but it's still better to be safe than sorry. You could direct others to the promo instead and let them get a key themselves. Also it's not just about codes being valid, they could be purchased fraudulently and charged back by the victim and your account would be suspended
---
[There are tons of ways actually!](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_armor#Acquisition_methods) Raids, Fractals, PvP, and WvW all have tons of ways to get ascended gear.  I also like to do Tequatl every day at reset, I've gotten an ascended box or two there.

I actually just started playing GW2 last weekend. my first choice was an Asura Necro..but i'm feeling kinda squishy..is that just the nature of early game or do i just need to gitgud?

Omg this means that everyone will believe that Taimi dies, but it will be Braham and we get Aurene back but it will be a fat dragon.

Is this the average American ignorance that I hear about? Have you even been outside of US ever to talk about other places, or just read crap online considering it to be truth?
---
Rely on US for our military?
---
Mate, we don't need any protection by the US because unlike the US we are not at war with any country or have been attacking other countries, as a matter of fact, it was the US which required our forces when it decided to wage war against Afagn calling the NATO, and we helped you morons. Facts, go check.
---
Next, our socialism doesn't get any fucking shut from you guys, we pay our taxes and it is just that our laws are based to help the citizens rather than the rich.

What demasculinization and BS are you even talking about? Give an instance or example else you just sound as ignorant dumbass who makes up shit without giving any shred of evidence, obviously this would work in TD and your kind but the rest of do not take information just from random internet trolls see.
---
Yeah, they leave, who cares. It's their freedom and we respect that. Unlike you uncultured fucks who have never known a place outside 3 blocks your home.
---
School comment was shitty? Ok, sorry I hurt your feelings..you kinda asked for it by going for my country, telling me I should be ashamed first :) 
---
I just gave you something to be ashamed off..or be proud of idc.
---
Smokescale, by far.
---
Rev sword 3 is my favorite weapon skill in the game, and having access to it on a ranger feels soooo good. And the quick knockdown can be a lifesaver.

I am trying to figure out if I should get Path of Fire and Heart of Thorns. I was a huge pvp player in Guild Wars 1, and was hoping to find the same experience in GW2 but didn't find the same niche spot when it came to player vs player combat. However, I was ABSOLUTELY mesmerized by the art style, the art design, the level dosing for each zone, and the overall ascetics of every region. I literally explored every single piece on every single map I could simply because I was in love with how beautiful the environments and zones where.
---
I'm curious if HOT/POF will provide enough content to make the 50$ feel worth it.
---
If there were no limit to these codes it would be less precious. The outfit shows your dedication towards the game. It is meant for people who stay in touch with the game and don't just log in for some free loot. 
---
The later kind of person will likely learn too late about promotions like this. While someone who is actively playing and caring about the game will quickly learn about the promotion and get their key.

All that being said it's best to find a guild or even just a commander on your server and see when they run. You'll have a lot more fun following a coordinated organised group in voice chat than random groups. Check to see if they also have builds they want people to run otherwise [vabbi](http://builds.vabbi.org) or [metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/WvW) are good for zerg builds.
---
They could just make the next Ranger elite spec be a Spellbreaker of sorts. Strong in PvP, but also a nice DPS alternative in PvE.
---
There's nothing wrong with having more than one DPS spec, as long as Soulbeast is a little over the new spec in terms of PvE damage.
---
Whats world boss rush?

[Get both on sale now for 38% off](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911) or wait for a 50% sale (happens pretty often) to drop the pack to $25. Like /u/Aemilia said, the expansions both look amazing and the living story is worth it as well. If you enjoy the story get season 2 (it is the lead up to Heart of Thorns) otherwise just get season 3 and 4 (I'm hoping for a sale on the full pack). Priority though is the expansions, can always get the living story later (and if you log in now the current one for free).
---
I do use my rolls until they are depleted -- or I have memories of constantly being energy starved from using them since I knew it would be almost an instant KO if I'm hit.  But I never used sigils that would give me extra energy for such.  My memories of the system was that it was very clunky and didn't feel good to use; the way the story was trying to make me out to be a hero when I felt like a chicken hoping someone else gets aggro in an event was immersion breaking for me back then.
---
Thanks for the build and tips.  I'll keep it save for if I want to go back to my warrior in the future.
---
Same, it's the randomness that's super annoying. It also likes to occasionally forget that GW2 is supported at all, forcing me to reinstall GeForce Experience if I want to use it again.

JQ WvW guilds that do open raids during SEA:

There should be more but we're linked now so I'm not exactly sure which other guilds are on JQ :p
---
It's not about benchmark specifically but gameplay wise, i'd like to have a control over my character.
---
Everyone is talking about how "unthematic" or "unlore" it is but i don't really care about that, these options shouldn't prevent a smooth gameplay. 
---
Logic in a game is something important but sometimes it has to be broke for the sake of the gameplay.
---
Maybe you should just drop Berserker and play Reaper instead.
---
Aka turn Berserker into Holosmith? No thanks.
---
No it doesn't. Turning it into an "other form," as you said, sounds like dumbing it down to oblivion and turning it into Death Shroud 2.0.
---
Your character portraits look weird in the character selection, that's how you know it's working.
---
Holy fuck! These cosplays are incredible!! I tried recreating Kratos in my norn warrior but can't really find the right tattoo. Could you help me out with that please? :3 I also like the first Bloodborne cosplay!! :)
---
Since I've played the new Devil May Cry, and reached the point where you play with V, I wished for an Ranger elite Spec like that.
---
In short... V doesn't really attack the enemies himself. Instead he summons a cat and bird demon for melee and ranged replacements. So it's more a management of his pets while not getting smashed by something directly. With flashy finishing moves where he jumps in for a split second, does a lot of damage, and jumpes out of range again.
---
There are a couple of V Gameplay videos on YT if someone is interested how this all works...
---
Go play Reaper.
---
Berserker isn't the class for you. I'm done arguing with you.
---
What would certainly be much less interesting is turning berserk mode into the rampage elite and replacing that default warrior elite skill with something else.
---
Yeah, I find it kind of funny how polar-opposite the Warrior elite specs are in terms of theme.
---
Berserker is... an angry berserker with Rage skills. Spellbreaker is a disciplined and calm warrior with quick dagger attacks and meditation skills.
---
They still could do with having more. All of the things you've listed are very PvE-minded, while Rage skills in competitive modes are just horrible because they don't do enough to justify giving up a utility slot for them. I like the idea of making Rage skills have a small additional effect while in Berserk mode. Maybe something like (this is off the top of my head):
---
Sundering Leap: while in Berserk mode, it does additional damage and removes inhibiting conditions from you when used.  
---
Wild Blow: while in Berserk mode, it does additional damage ignores blind and weakness (its old effects).  
---
Outrage: while in Berserk mode, it deals damage around the player when breaking stuns.  
---
Shattering Blow: while in Berserk mode, bleeding duration is increased.  
---
Blood Reckoning: while in Berserk mode, immediate healing is doubled and grants resistance for 2 seconds.  
---
Headbutt: while in Berserk mode, self-stun duration is halved and applies weakness to enemies hit.
---
It can be about Choya for all I care,if only we get more info and a release date.
---
&gt;Wow, that's quality armour.
---
FTFY
---
Sorry it is another developer,... Same issue tho.
---
 You mean the requirement that any 'gambling' provider have a physical establishment is really easy to implement?
---
I like to merge with my dog, Alexander!
---
True, but at least with the gemstore stock you know it'll come back eventually. It always does.
---
A new infusion? I wasn't paying enough attention to notice.
---
Removing a self stun....is a nerf. Okay bud.
---
The reason why it self-stuns is that it's designed to be used with Outrage to proc Rousing Resilience... bud.
---
Removing it would be a nerf.
---
What we get:
---
* We get a new living world story episode very soon (probably next Tuesday)
---
* After the final of Living world Season 4 we get Season 5 which, if they keep their release schedule of 2-3 months and 6 episodes per season, we can look for new content releases until mid to late 2020
---
* there are new updates in the works with build templates and many other things
---
What we have:
---
* According to ArenaNet we have 11 million players
---
* we have a lot of content that will keep you entertained for countless hours
---
* content is not based on grinding but you can if you so choose
---
You literally have no risk here. Register an account and play for free, see if you like the game. Buy the expansions if you do. It won't shut down anytime soon. It was never more worth it to get into the game.

They will get an awesome unique outfit an we on the EU ? Just a mini egg. Not an unique mini like we got Mini Mystical Dragon for Activating 2-Step Verification. But an egg from wich you have around 90% to get mini worth nothing. I got a Mini Skritt Forager wich is worth 5s 45b on the Tp. 
---
I feel like guys on US side got their finger cut and will get a bandage, anestetics and everything they would ever wish for. We on the EU side will get blowed up by granade. Our arm and leg is gone. We are bleeding on the ground and only thing we will get a tape on it just so we couldnt complain. The fact that we got a mini egg is more insulting then getting nothing in the first place. If we wouldnt get anything then sure we could say that is event for them or something but by giving us the mini egg they are digging into the wound for fun.
---
I have only tested it for a very short time but my guess is that the range increase didn't help the already weird behavior  of the skill when the terrain is not flat. Plus I'm also not 100% sure how they increase the cone of the pull: just made it longer without changing the angle so that the width at 750 range remains the same and then the width at 900 range is bigger OR make the width at 900 range the same as it was on the previous version at 750 resulting in a slightly smaller radius.

At this point I feel like it's the same as getting into Game of Thrones "now", or reading a book from a few decades ago "now". Yes, it's very much enjoyable and will be for a long time.
---
I'd really like to know as well. Apparently the game discounts are NA only but for the actual game codes who know.
---
You got what he meant , he was just wrong.
---
I remember when I first proposed the boon protection monk and people universally went "what a garbage skill why would you run that build its useless!". Then it was meta.
---
Wharthog. Decent DPS and a cc for raids
---
In benchmark power chrono does around 38k dps which is pretty good score. Don't take this seriously, in boss fight you will never achieve those numbers.
---
You have to understand that power chrono is squishy, but it actually does high burst damage. It has literally everything and it is very mobile. Just don't take Well Of Calamity. Phantasmal Defender or Disenchanter is much better (and generates a clone after all). Thanks to Chronomatophasma, your phantasms can strike again.
---
I don't see any problem to play power chrono in fractals and raids. It has little delay with damage, but still better than condi.
---
2 questions:
---
1: Have you got any where you cosplay as a charr?
---
2: Have you tried doing a big daddy cosplay from Bioshock as a charr?
---
I demand that this ball should be filled with an asura which runes like a hamster
---
What kind of firebrand? Hybrid Quickbrand with Berserker / Diviner gear or Healbrand with Minstrel? Which is better for unorganised play do you think&gt;
---
GW2 has more to offer for you, than for veterans. So yes, if you're new, this game is the best deal on mmo market currently.
---
Anet literally said 11 milion players, though it's an obvious lie :)
---
Serious question as a new Chronomancer myself, as well as being new to GW2 in general: I was trying to learn the rotation for your snowcrows link and got stuck. Do they really expect me to cast Phantasmal Disenchanter, Signet of Ether, Phantasmal Swordsman, Phantasmal Disenchanter again, and Blurred Fury.. ALL BEFORE THE CONTINUUM SPLIT DURATION IS OVER? The duration is 2 seconds.... If that's what is expected of this class then I'm out.
---
I am fine with most parts in PvP. But Zerk GS F1.... What the actual fuck man. That shit is not okay. A single spin hits harder then a Gravedigger and its 3 of them which can be reset with your heal. Warriors can hit through blocks if they take their signet and dodging only lets you dodge 2 of the spins (3 if the warr has quickness).
---
Its simply too much, especially since warriors already had strong options elsewhere.
---
Guilds are what you make them. They can be boring and dead or alive and inspiring. A guildie and i arrange a monthly quiz on our own accord. You don't have to be bounded by the limitations of the system in place.
---
Given that basically all the other services have managed, yes.
---
was looking for this!
---
Anetsux isn't a nice or creative name but it's hardly an issue tbh. Not exactly very offensive.
---
GW2, like many other MMOs, employs predictive client-side to ensure a smooth gameplay experience.
---
It accounts for the delay between when input data is sent from a player to a server, and then returned as true or false.
---
If this predictive feature wasn’t part of online games, players would appear to teleport between every ‘tick’ instead of moving smoothly.
---
High latency can result in inaccurate predictions being rejected by the server, which also impacts the online experience for other players interacting with high-latency players, even if they’re on high-speed connections with low latencies.
---
Additionally, if a player reacts between a server’s update window (tick rate), predictive system will reject slower input from other players.
---
We see plenty of that in GW2 when the servers are congested.
---
Tick rate is linked to the refresh rate of your display and, in turn, the maximum frame rate of the game.
---
In short, if your PC can’t consistently hit a frame rate that’s identical (or faster) to the tick rate, you’re not likely to see the impact of (particularly faster) tick rates.
---
It is a multiple things at play here. Both your PC coping with loading all those skins and effects in a very short window of time, and the sudden connectivity congestion between server and client. As a result your FPS suffers. You get big dips.
---
The only way you can offset some of these is with better internet and some object culling provided by GW2DX12proxy.
---
You see it as people and objects loading in as fast as YOUR system allows, instead of just loading in past that limit.
---
I tested the proxy and it really really improves the minimum FPS quite a bit. I see it as minor artifacts which bother me FAR less than big FPS drops.
---
1: Brian from family guy and the Dragon cosplay
---
2: No, ive looked into it tho, but there is no good helm for it:)
---
Regarding the three controversies:
---
**Mount Skins License**
---
• It’s purely cosmetic (no P2W)
---
• Mainly referring to the first batch of Mount License Skins (RNG based). Aside from this, there’s also the more popular 5 pack non RNG skins (Bundles). 
---
• The RNG loot box consists of 30 skins for 5 different types of mounts, with no way to choose the type of mount. I.e. Players were outraged with the 1/30 probability whereas a 1/6 chance would’ve been more bearable. 
---
• After the outrage, a Mount Select License has been introduced for subsequent RNG skins. It cost triple the RNG price, but players can pick the specific skin they wanted. 
---
• Instead of 30 skins, subsequent Mount licenses are an RNG of 15 skins. 
---
• It’s worth noting that players can’t get repeat skins, so the RNG pool gets smaller with each unlock. 
---
• Also worth noting that paid/upgraded accounts can convert ingame gold to cash store gems. There’s always the option of not using RL cash if a player don’t feel like it. 
---
**She who shall not be named**
---
• Calling her a feminist is giving her too much credit. She was a batshit crazy sexist. Talking to her was like talking to an anti vaxxer flat earther. 
---
•  She poster work related stuff in her private Twitter, a well respected Anet partner and content creator thought it was a discussion and made some suggestions to improve the game. Ms Banshee then rained down the fury of hell’s wrath on him. 
---
• Ms Banshee insulted him, called him a “rando asshat”. Bear in mind, this guy contributed so much towards the betterment of the game that Anet named an NPC after him. 
---
• This guy immediately apologised after the first backlash and moved on. The community backed him up, to which Ms Banshee go full retard. 
---
• She said stuff like how she’s off the clock and don’t need to be the “emotional courtesan” of players. There was so much bile and vitriol in the tweets. 
---
• She pissed off so many players that they threatened to quit GW2 en masse. Yours truly included. 
---
• First day of work after the holidays, her boss fired her. A fellow dev that stood up for her was fired too. 
---
• Up till this day, she still strongly believed she got fired for being a woman. 
---
**Communication**
---
• After Banshee incident communication from devs was reduced significantly. Devs had to be extra careful when commenting on Reddit etc. Understandable, but sucks nonetheless. 
---
• After mass layoffs, communication and transparency has improved a lot. Anet would announce their plans and changes in the forum
---
before they go live. The most recent example would be the releasing balance patch information a few days before they’re implemented. 
---
• I’d say communication is at a good spot atm. I’d prefer Anet to take community feedback and make changes before patch goes live, but baby steps :)
---
**Gemstore**
---
• Nothing wrong with cash store. 
---
• GW2 cash store mainly sells convenience and cosmetics. No P2W. 
---
**Endgame**
---
Truly up to you. You can do high end PvE (fractals and Raids), competitive (PvP and WvW), fashion wars, work on legendaries (bling), explore, challenge yourself with achievements, farm, do jumping puzzles, goof around, hanging around starter maps helping new players etc. This game is *huuuuuuuge*. 
---
**Critism**
---
Not so much the game, but the minority bitter and vocal veteran players. Nothing can please them. Just remember to take their views with a mountain of salt. 
---
**Cash Store Recommendations**
---
1. Copper Fed Salvage O Matic
---
2. Mistlock Sanctuary VIP pass
---
3. Shared Slots
---
4. Bank Slots
---
5. Material Storage expander (even 1 or 2 is nice)
---
6. Bag slots (note: this unlock per character, not per account)
---
7. Unlimited gathering tools (pure convenience. Eg. Say you run out of finite tools in a mobby zone, can’t equip a new one until you’re out of combat). 
---
**Expansions**
---
 
---
HoT unlocks glider and the ability to play Living World Season 3 episodes (LS3). PoF unlocks mounts and ability to play LS4 content. Atm we are anticipating the final episode of season 4, which should drop next month. Hype!
---
On a scale of 1-10, I’d give Core Tyria a 3 and expansions an 8 content wise. The maps are massive, detailed and populated by challenging enemies. Dying repeatedly in HoT is a rite of passage. 
---
If you’re on a free account, ASAP (or during sale) to remove F2P limitations. If you’re on core account (bought the game before HoT was released), then you can wait until you’re max level or something.
---
Buncha mini karka hatchlings tumbling in the ball and shit... I'm laughing as I type this because that would be fucking hilarious.
---
You're welcome! :)
---
And I didn't think that use of items was OP. I saw it was something you only used for the part of the fight where the numbers were stacked against you heavily, so it made sense. I like to see instances where the items aren't used to skip an entire mechanic and still net a win is all!
---
why is it not a chariot being attached to a magical device hovering over a glass ball containing another glass ball containing a mini robot hamster running inside controlled by a charr gliding over you the entire time while being held by a hot air baloon?
---
This. I really like the hawk pet (have the eagle now because hawk is sadly condi) because I roll with the BM tree. The birds even tho they have low HP have a dodge ability on a low CD and can taunt every 4 secs. When I get in trouble with ranger in general, even soulbeast I unmerge and make my pet tank. This obv isn't for raids but pets can still be useful when you don't merge in OW and PvP.   
---
I saved other people multiple times by swapping to my fern hound, sending him in for the knockdown f2 howl heal+taunt and then merging for another big heal.   
---
I like the pets in GW2 a lot, I kinda wish for soulbeast for us to be able to choose the merged abilities (so not pet specific) and I don't think they're useless. I do hope our next elite is more focused around utilizing them for a lot of us chose ranger for the pets.  
---
(Also I like the green vines animations for it goes excellent with my salad B) )
---
Bunny Thumper returns??
---
I mean most content can be done with little more than just auto attacking.  CMs are probably the only thing that don't.
---
The game does *not* have a high skill floor.  People need to stop playing off like it does.
---
I didn't even consider this until now..  
---
Neat!
---
Point is I am not a slave to Anet's lame storytelling as I can enjoy other parts of teh game. I am amazed though the first responder consider LW soap opera as main part of the game. I find it laughable.
---
Exactly, the Ironclad Outfit....I tried to get a perfectly matching Armor get-up to imitate the almighty Space Marines but I am still not pleased with the results.
---
I've seen some good attempts but often it falls apart at the legs or shoulder armor. But there are some good Breast and Pauldron designs at least.
---
Not seen on the screen is that they all wear the recently released [Legion Jetpack](http://dulfy.net/2019/04/02/gw2-gemstore-legion-jetpack-and-super-adventure-box-chair/) Glider/Backpack...while it is not perfect it nearly captures the iconic Jump Backpacks of (Chaos) Marines...
---
Lmao
---
I have power DH guardian and tbh the utility and support it has just gives you yourself a lot of options to help yourself and others while being a GS powerhouse. It's GS skills are by far my fav and the DH elite spec gives you access to a very good ranged weapon+virtues become way more fun.   
---
I also recommend trying the DH guardian with power and GS
---
Well unless you have another character it will be another 7 years before you get 7th birthday. It is worth keeping it if it is your only old character imo.
---
Just as an fyi - race has no effect on gameplay outside of a few insignificant abilities (which were designed to be bad). The smallest Asuran warrior is just asbpowerful as the largest Charr warrior.
---
Playing the long game and waiting for that off-hand sword spec for Ranger.
---
What if I just want to be a cheerleader in warrior?
---
I like that they added more terrain but I think they went WAY over the top with the additions.
---
If you compare it to any other map (foefire for example, which is the most balanced) you have like 2-3 kiting / jumping puzzles and that's it. Here you have like 10. It became way too crowded. Mid feels okay, but the sides would be better with 2-3 racks / bushes and that's it.
---
context
---
xD
---
I think a lot of ppl just want to play whatever they like the most in open world, like you say anything works there so the main factor here is fun, and power zerk is pretty fun now imo. You don't need perma 25might and signets for it to be fun :)
---
Personally, first, i hate Windows 10. Second, I do not believe in that extra proxy-layer can actually increase my performance. Third, I guess as Russian guy i prefer not to use something created by another Russian guy
---
you need a guild to get access to guild bank storage! Which is a lifesaver for hoarders, and many of us are hoarders. :P
---
full celestial sword/dagger weaver? you can go dagger/dagger core ele prior to unlocking weaver.
---
So there was a new balance patch that just came out ([you can see the mesmer changes here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_updates/2019-04-23#Mesmer)) but most of them were aimed at PvP. The big one for PvE is the "[Blinding Dissipation](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blinding_Dissipation)" change making mirage's confusion output lower when comboed with [Ineptitude](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ineptitude). If you want actual up to date builds you'll want to wait a little while but not much changed for most builds.[ Snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/support/) is still the go to site for raids, [dT](https://discretize.eu/builds) for fractals, [Vabbi](http://builds.vabbi.org) for WvW zergs, and [mettabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Mesmer) for everything else. If you're looking to learn support chrono for fractals and raids I'd suggest looking at the [basic rotation here](https://youtu.be/H1154AbvI34) first, Jaffa does a good job of breaking it all down.
---
I do have 6 other characters being this old.😂😂
---
I probably should have Made a Gift opening video for everyone else to enjoy. Well 7th birthday for all of them then.
---
I'll be happy if my GTX 1070 can somehow give me more than 40 FPS :C
---
1.2k-1.5k dps buff and significant increase in burst while also now being immortal I'd sat is a pretty significant buff...
---
Not sure if this is useful but I used my VPN and created an account, got the code for the shirt and was able to redeem it on an EU GW2 account.
---
Nope i don't treat it as a 2nd job 😋 i see numbers, i tell numbers, that's all i know. If it's my 2nd job, i should have known better right?  
---
That last log, I was talking about my friend who also plays an off meta build and he hits a higher number in all of our runs with pugs. I could give you his ign and you whisper join one of those +250ess CMs runs with him and see for yourself. I don't think he's been raiding much lately.  
---
He was bugging at the fact people don't think an off meta build could do as much damage as the meta one. For spellbreaker which he runs almost exclusively, he said something about rng, which made he run the way he does.  
---
Just like quickbrand has been around for ages as off meta before they were made tested by SC. 
---
SC? SC are still people, friends we're playing with. You're talking like they're Gods. In fact i have a good friend playing with them. He raid daily which something is not for me. But we all love build crafting a lot, just go different roads. I like me being filthy and build one for all 😆 
---
I'm just a casual like i said i am. If a newbie on a class like me and could hit those numbers, anyone can. That's what I'm trying to convey and give tips to OP. But my words maybe be the best choice.  
---
Did you look at the health bar on the twitch? I was at 18k health, i trade off a lot of damage cuz the built was meant for wvw. But i still run it for pve and deal competitive dps. What are you laughing at? Lol. That you had to dig around other comments and try to prove yourself right? Ooh please, I never say I'm right you know. Lol
---
Here is proof that it works (results may vary):  [https://imgur.com/a/oofbx6l](https://imgur.com/a/oofbx6l)
---
Guess Alienware weren't halfway competent, then. :D
---
Still, it takes less time to try 10+ different temporary mails in hopes of finding one that works, than to create a single proper burner mail account. The latter is becoming even more troublesome lately, with services requiring you to verify your identity via a phone call (ha, dream on, I ain't giving you fuckers my phone number) or something along these lines.
---
I can understand not being able to salvage them, but extracting?  Come on....
---
What's the best way to farm gold now that Istan is dead? I already do t4 fractals daily but I feel like it's not enough. Someone told me SW is the way to go, but I don't have a character in the level range to max profit.
---
There is not really the "one perfect thing" to get Karma but many places that you can do.
---
The Karmic Retribution is very good for this and there is an Event on the Sandswept Isles prior to the "The Specimen Chamber" which spawns a lot of mobs in three locations, the more players that are there the more it will scale up and more mobs will spawn with Elite and Champions. Each of those can give you the karma Item.
---
I also found that Jahai Bluffs is a good source for that (not as good as Sandswept Isles for the event) but is more about roaming the Map and killing stuff in it.
---
&gt;That last log, I was talking about my friend who also plays an off meta  build and he hits a higher number in all of our runs with pugs. I could  give you his ign and you whisper join one of those +250ess CMs runs with  him and see for yourself. I don't think he's been raiding much lately. 
---
I like that you still don't understand the difference between fractals and raids. And do you seriously think you can impress me 250KP runs? That fractal is out for ages, 250KP is basically nothing.
---
&gt; He was bugging at the fact people don't think an off meta build could do as much damage as the meta one. 
---
That's great, but what's wrong with people with more than 10 IQ bugging about you and your friend not understanding what meta means?
---
&gt; Just like quickbrand has been around for ages as off meta before they were tested by SC 
---
Go educate on stuff you want to bring up as an argument please. Just because people played firebrand before that doesn't mean SC never tested it. It just never was as good as chrono before tanking multiple nerfs.
---
&gt; You're talking like they're Gods. In fact i have a good friend playing with them. 
---
I didn't even mention SC. I told you your DPS is not what you tell others it is. But nice try again trying to impress with your friend who plays with SC. Couldn't care less.
---
&gt; I'm just a casual like i said i am. If a newbie on a class like me and could hit those numbers, anyone can 
---
Except you're not able to hit those numbers.
---
"prepare for what's coming with the war eternal supply drop", sadly I think you're right.
---
Ty bro, i will try both the methods
---
Oh no, I feel so BETRAYED, how dare they GIVE FREE STUFF AWAY. Outrageous.
---
Woa gj!  
---
Me stay in my safe zone? Nah. What you talking about, salty? You asked, I delivered. I'd send pathetic logs. Nothing to be ashamed of. I have room for improvement as far as rotations and builds. I said i saw those numbers on arcdps. So i said it is like it is.  
---
Why did you back off from my offer of joining my friend run? If you keep insulting other players as having 10 IQ and delusional then take the offer. Otherwise, i think my friend would be still "delusional" unless someone beats his dps. But i guess you're just as much as a keyboard warrior so ciao.
---
Worst thing is it's USA only...feels fucking scammed being EU tbh
---
Jesus you're a drama queen. The rules of this promotion were clearly stated and there's also another one coming that's more eu oriented.
---
Wow that’s just awesome! Good job
---
tyvm
---
You are forgetting that together with gambling licenses comes heavy responsability for age verification and addiction prevention and transparency for odds. THAT is what gaming companies want to avoid because it is too hard to do. 
---
Do you really think Belgium, where people pay about 35%+ taxes, needs the revenue from gambling licenses?
---
Pls arenanet fix Berserker fast. So low dmg for so high costs..
---
Ngl, my favorite is probably Marvin the Martian, so crazy spot on lol.
---
Use the Special Forces Training area to practice it, and learn the skill priority. You'll get the muscle memory down in no time.
---
lol dude i don't care
---
Thats some long ass neck, damn
---
Menzies was way worse than Balthazar ever got. 
---
So if taking way Balthazar's powers would have given them to Menzies, I doubt the gods would have done it.
---
I suspect Menzies has long been dead.
---
I figured that much. Asura are just my favorite race from the few options we have :-)
---
That's definitely not FXAA. FXAA is an anti-aliasing method to sharpen things up.
---
Totally!
---
Trying the base game is free and gives you a chance to try the ropes. From PvE point you're offered a rich storyline that expands into instances and raids.
---
And in case you get into it, expansions are fairly often available on discounts with 50% off if not more :)
---
In unorganized play, you want *one* of your renegade or firebrand to be a healer. Not both, because with two healers your DPS will be low enough that it extends fights long enough for you to wipe to mechanics that can't be healed through.
---
When it comes to DPS + Support *and* Healing + Support, the Firebrand pulls ahead, unfortunately. So for groups where you expect big heals to be more useful than big DPS you use Diviner Renegade + Heal Firebrand, and for groups where you expect that high DPS will be more important than massive fault tolerance, you use Healing Renegade and Berserker Firebrand.
---
This so much, lol. All these years I've been playing staff for 99% of my gametime, but this week I started practicing sword/dagger and it's been a fun and suicidal road.
---
Don't just learn the rotation, but the idea behind it. Read your skills and traits, know your dmg modifiers and hard hitting skills. Helps a ton in my experience. Also good in situations where you have to improvise.
---
&gt; Dps carry pugs fractals
---
Boons carry harder, especially if a build can do solid DPS while providing a universally useful boon.
---
Power Firebrand is 100% that build. It can easily outperform badly played DPS builds while still providing permanent Quickness to the whole party and packing the F3 book to block mechanics.
---
&gt; Others had called for ways to get rid of the rangers pet basically since launch.
---
There are eight other professions for those people to play. The ranger at its very core is the pet proffession. It is also the only profession with elite specs which discards the core profession rather than advance and build upon it.
---
Compare how both guardian elite specs enhance guardian virtues, while neither ranger elite spec enhances the pet, one weakens it without interacting with it at all, the other turns it into a passive stat buff.
---
I do have alot of the skins, but naturally there are some like the celebration hat and other things were i had to use the wardrobe preview. Glad you enjoyed them:)!
---
Don't forget the guild karma boost, if you have any.
---
Your personal data is worth about 30 cents.. and that's for MUCH more information than this promo is asking for.
---
But endgame is pretty much about dyeing ;-)
---
Weawer (especially sword) is highest damage, but super fragile. You just can't survive in some encounters if you make mistakes.  
---
I recommend try tempest. It's my favorite, you can provide boons, utility. rotation is not that hard, also burst damage is so high.  
---
It will help you to play class overall, because tempest defensive abilities can forgive you some mistakes. When you will see that you do no mistakes, switch to weaver.
---
I just wanna go back to actual faction vs faction.
---
Maybe if we ever peek into Cantha, they have become ultra racist and wanna fight.
---
Problem is; Anet loves introducing new things, only to never use them again (sadly).  
---
There's so many things that would be amazing to have more of, but Anet just love inventing new ways rather than using what they already created, thus leading to lots of inconsistencies and chaos around their game.
---
I still think the [hybrid build](https://discretize.eu/builds/revenant/hybrid-renegade) is best. If you clear content faster you have less of a need to heal or do mechanics. If you really want to bring a healer it's best to go all the way with [something more like this](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Renegade_-_Boon_Support_Healer). Going a split between both healing and damage really hurts both builds.
---
Music is subjective; so i suggest simply muting it; and popping another playlist of your own creation on. &lt;3 (that or dont watch it at all :D) but i that aspect of solos i truely underestimated. The edditing, finding music etc all takes longer than u might think.
---
Wat
---
you mean that i whoud be finaly be able to see actual bosses?
---
Most builds are a combination of berserker, assassin and diviner. The exact combinat isn't too important unless you're min-maxing. 
---
A lot of chronomancer defence is *active*. Shield 4 and sword 4 are both blocks, which need careful timing. I find doing them slightly later than you think helps. 
---
Sword 2 gives you a second or so of evade. The F4 shatter also prevents damage. Don't forget to dodge when you can. 
---
Phantasmal defender has a taunt, so you can use it to draw enemies away from you. The healing signet resets phantasm cooldown timers, which is just great all round g oy use phantasms. 
---
Gravity well and focus 4 are both good for when you need to just shut enemies down for a second. 
---
Mantra of pain and calamity well are both decent attacks. 
---
Sword/shield and /sword is a good combo, with /focus instead if you need to take down small groups, like in fractals or open world stuff.
---
Don't have any screenshots but I was going around as Moss from the IT crowd a while back.  
---
Very few people got it but those who did loved it.
---
So where is the miniskirt?
---
Maybe the reason is because having a chak infusion on US/EU is like giving "I'm rich, you know" a visual effect :P
---
Ohhh, GW1 content - always upvote a fellow veteran ;-)
---
Try again I'll give ya one more chance
---
Disable Post-processing in graphics settings. It only adds unnatural saturation, ridiculous amounts of bloom and makes some areas look blackened/tarnished (like Crystal Desert, for example)
---
Those Witcher girls are pretty good. And I like seeing other Dark Souls/Bloodborne cosplayers. 
---
Currently I only have the fire keeper and Maria, want more tho.
---
Practice my friend, that's everything you need. Don't try to make it easier, dying is a part of the learning.
---
seeing most people already recommended necro, I disagree with the few that suggested condi. in sub 80 content, especially story, most things don't live long enough for condi to ramp up, let alone fill them up and epi. power necro may not be ideal compared to higher dps classes, at least until you get reaper, but it works perfectly well. the range of axe is nice, but it's single target damage. staff is generally a utility weapon and really not good for leveling and story. dagger however huts multiple targets, hits fast (combine with food that steals life), has a decent lifeleach on #2 and can be combined with offhands for various purposes - warhorn for mobility, additional damage and a good stun, focus for life force generation, dagger to cleanse yourself of condis. whenever shroud is full, use it until about 50%, even though you don't have the trait that increases your damage above 50% yet, it's good practice and you always have an emergency buffer.
---
minions alone should provide more than enough lifesteal to keep you topped off, but as I said, combine it with food - either lifesteal or just regen Food. there's also lifeleech sigils, do give those a try.
---
also learn to love active defenses, necro has few so it's easy to get into (compared to say mesmer). the well that blinds enemies basically males you invulnerable against normal mobs for its duration. stuns can interrupt big damage skills, dodged are to be used against other high damage hits, not normal auto attacks (which is probably why you ran out of endurance).
---
other than that, if you feel you take too much damage, make sure your gear isn't many levels below your character and don't wander into zones with high level enemies.
---
&gt;FXAA is an anti-aliasing method to sharpen things up.
---
And it does it by doing the exact opposite.
---
ALT+9 to talk to a character ?!?!
---
&gt; (though you won't see it in pugs)
---
Which is a shame because it brings Matthias back to the same level of ease as it was when Chaos Chronos would spam stab and perma resistance.
---
Beast master elite spec allows 3-4 pets, like mesmers and necro have already.. For pet focused people

You get 1½ seconds per clone shattered... so yeah you can do pretty much in those ~5sec sec.
---
You are describing Gw2 class and weapon system, idk how is this related to only PvP..
---
Comming from WoW and a new GW2 player I appreciate the amount of variation in skills.
---
Never again
---
Oh, you again. Are you stalking me? 
---
Weren't your insults in the other posts enough, so you ned to continue it? Seriously, grow up kid.
---
Thank you Creed
---
You shut your mouth! I care about that little guy more than I care about like half of Dragon's Watch! ;n;
---
I wanna hear the actual game sounds rather then music. I always find it a waste to add music to gaming videos. To each his own. Hence my question.
---
Hawk to run all around
---
Bambie to try hard dps
---
Smoke when I wanna turn stealth
---
Not entirely new but sure!
---
Get both Sets, I don't trust Renegade healers much but thats just because Firebrands can provide healing themselfes and they're way more reliable in that regard.
---
Diviner Renegades are quite usefull nontheless.

If NA, add me up "Carrot Shank"

Hey man, I have problems when i install arcdps i got random disconnects ingame. It works fine for 1 day and then  when i log in i can play around 15-20 mins and game disconnect me from server. I run game on  new SSD and I use last version of win 10 and last version of arc. This random Dc's only happen when i install arcdps, and i use it without build templates and its only addon i use . Do u have any idea what could cause this problem?
---
Tnx in advice
---
Go farm Fractal 61, get yourself a pSoulbeast, pChronomancer, cFirebrand ... they're usually high bursting underwater.
---
If you got any Fractal Titles you get even more cash through Fractal Encryptions.
---
What makes me mad about PVP is that I think the "unified boon/condition system" is pretty useless.  What is the point if the most important buffs are skill effects that do not fall under this system at all.  And on top of that the icons for them are tiny on my UI.  If anyone knows of any 3rd party tools to let me zoom in on enemy play effects let me know.
---
Minion necro.  Easy mode.  Not the fastest kills, but the tradeoff is how low-stress it is.
---
Gear up head to toe in Dire exotics and spam conditions from range while your minions tank.  Run Curses, Blood, Death.  Laugh at how easy everything has suddenly become.
---
Yes, I just proved you wrong, you can meme all you want now :)
---
Thank you! Glad you enjoy it:). List took forever to create and i mean i could have included characters i dont know myself, but then the list would be endless. I might try to make a HUGE list containing all the ones ever created that look decent enough, and then this sailor senshi could perhaps be included, but thats for another time :}
---
Druid has two purposes IMO: Keep your group alive and buff(ed) - provide as much CC/utility as possible so the DPS can go braindead on rotations. Or in other words: sacrifice all your personal damage in favor for best group performance. Your pet swap CD suggestion would influence your utility purposes while just decreasing pet stats in general affects an area of your performance that nobody should be looking at. If you wanted to do damage, you wouldn't be playing druid in the first place.
---
And yet you instulted me, again.
---
You can fabricate as many "reasons" and "proofs" as you want, your
---
&gt;    I am winning...
---
just confirms what I already said. You are nothing more than a little troll who starts fights and keep instulting, to annoy people. If I look at your profile and at your other posts it just confirms even more that you are no serious person.
---
If you think you would "win" anything by being an ass, do so, but it doesn't solve your problems that cause this thinking. You win nothing, no matter if I or anybody else reply to you or not. Your behavior ist just pitiable, no matter what anybody answers to you. And nothing will change this.

TBH, don't even bother switching to Weaver for fractals, it's not necessary. Tempest gives you high enough dps and is so much more relaxed and reliable. For raids it's different because the fights are far longer, meaning Tempest's high burst can't carry you over to the next phase and there are generally far less interrupts, meaning you can get more value out of weaver.

Total training wheels mode.  It literally can't get any easier and disengaged than that.  This is with cheap exotics, probably not even 25 gold to fully gear up.  It will carry you through a huge majority of the game.  Only downside is that all that toughness will mean Champs and Legendaries will single you out in a crowd.  But then again, you have the tools to take care of yourself.  If that really is an issue for you, then switch from Dire to Carrion (Vitality doesn't seem to affect aggro).  That will also be a slight DPS increase.
---
Start there, and as you make gold and feel yourself getting better, you can switch a lot and move the slider from tankiness to DPS as you see fit.
---
Oh it's a skin? Of course I haven't looked that up thank you! :) Great work!
---
anets philosophy is to abandon old content and just make new stuff, occasionally they will fix the new stuff if it's broken
---
I have seen that one, It was already good so I didnt include it. I might contact the guy creating it tho at some point :)
---
No idea what a bunch of harmonized german animals would have sounded like but I'm pretty sure these creatures would produce sounds so terrifying and soul-piercing that Bremen wouldn't even be on the map anymore.
---
I'm sure you can find them on ebay for $100 from the people who botted them to resell!
---
Tick is not linked to FPS.
---
Again, the tick rate of the server is most likely 1-6 tick. It's not going to be a tick rate that would result in a playable frame rate for a human. The poor FPS people get is 100% client side.

I tried so hard to get Solair to work but there just isnt a good enough helm :/

It's 1920x1080, but all my games have fucked screenshots. New Vegas's, Skyrim's, TF2, Whenever I take screenshots, they come out messed up looking.
---
good luck?
---
Celestial is a vanilla prefix that came before Concentration and Expertise were a thing. So Celestial is merely a vanilla stat setup that uses the according stats. You also don't want these two stats in there because this means getting two more even stats will end up in reducing the numbers for every already added stat.
---
Gosh I remember that April fools day.. What makes it better that most people can't see, their character is making plane noises while they're doing this too.
---
Default gw2 client screenshot shouldn't be like this. Do you use geforce experience, steam or other overlay app with your games to take screenshots?
---
i use a naga, am on my second one. not using the numpad at all, since my grip makes it awkward as well, and eventually my hand would cramp up. mmo mice simply are not a solution for everyone. even though i can't fully use it, it's still pretty comfortable though.
---
The gemstore has its audience and plenty of people are using it with real-money bought gems. There is no reason to guilt trip people into spending real money on this game when they are not willing/able to.
---
How many exposure do I have to pay you if I want you to draw one of my characters? :D
---
These are great. Here's my Return of the Jedi [Luke Skywalker](https://i.imgur.com/ZiUWjzF.jpg).

---
Best art to date!
---
But did it take you 2hrs to shade the upper lip?
---
I had the same problem with my G600 at first. Took me some time to get used to changing my grip for it but I love it now.
---
Naga user since the original Naga mhere. Am now using the Naga Trinity but its the same layout as the Naga Chroma.
---
I simply fingertip / palm it from further behind than intended so that my thumb rests comfortably on the four buttons 7,8,10 and 11 (basically on the two button columns closest to the back of the mouse). Thus i use the side panel buttons the wrong way - 10,11,12 are 1,2,3 and 7,8,9 are 4,5,6 and so on. Makes handling the mouse much more comfortable for me.
---
If i were to palm or claw grip the mouse like its been designed, i would have to cramp my hand as well.
---
I see they still haven't fixed the clipping issue...
---
I kinda go with a hybrid grip but I find that my thumb just gets lost on a numpad-style layout, plus have a lot of accidental clicks on it.
---
What works for me is the Roccat Leadr.
---
Not a numpad, but I still manage to put all weapon skills, heal, utility 9, elite, F1-5, weapon swap, and special action all on the mouse. Utility 7 &amp; 8 I either key press or click, but most of my builds have utilities in those slots that aren't frequently used, like signets or an on-demand condi cleanse or CC or something.
---
And now that I'm thinking about it, I can get my last two utilities on there too without giving up much. And I'm only using the "Easy-shift" for my F1-5 skills, so it's not like I've got crazy combo keystrokes I'm needing to use in rapid sequence.
---
I like that it has a ton of buttons without having any two that are indistinguishable by touch.

You can do it, but it's only really worthwhile once a day.

Hey there. I've been mostly playing PvE, but have slowly grown fond of trying WvW (no PvP, really dislike it). And, after a long while of researching I found that... I'm completely lost.  
---
I've got 5 characters: Dragonhunter (zerker ascended), Berserker (rabid exotics I believe), Soulbeast (zerker exotics), Renegade (also rabid exotics), and lvl 47 Thief.  
---
Now, I like all classes everywhere with loads of different builds, but idk if it's a good idea to have multiple builds on 5 characters (especially so since I have \~90g in my budget). So I've been hoping some kind soul out here could recommend me what classes go where (as in, X - Raids, Y - Fractals, Z - WvW, etc). My goal is to be as versatile as possible, so I can adapt to every situation.  
---
Cheers!
---
Well, technically it's Shadow Yellow. On some armors it just looks like really dark black.
---
And if the past is anything to go off of, they go on hiatus after a season finale for a bit before the next episode. So uhhhh yeah. Then again, this is a hiatus in everything but name anyway.
---
Hey there! Literally just started the game last night. Had a blast so far, we ended up with about 7 people at one point just roaming the starter area doing hearts and things. 
---
If you’d like to hang with us or just a new player stream community in general let me know! The twitch channel is easily found as it’s the same as username. 👍
---
Neither of those I play much and I don't really enjoy mesmer at all but maybe I'll give them a shot. I need more hours on those professions anyways. I usually play warrior, revenant, and elementalist. I've only really tried to solo stuff like legendary bounties so maybe I'll also get more into fractals. Thanks for the advice!
---
8/10. It should've been your gf the one to draw it.
---
Thanks but not really big into crowds but ty very much due the offer

Sure, I'm eagerly waiting for the UPS dude to show up...

&gt;Anet's promo giveaways

Pick one.
---
Just stating that you gf was too shy to share or doesn't think it's good enough is a free ticket to the front page and gold. That's like karma whoring 101.
---
it says may 7 to 14 which is tuesday patch day
---
I've been jumping from game to game lately.  Played all the new AAA releases, had my fill of WoW and ESO so figured I'd try this game.  Started a month ago and I've put in way more hours than I'd like to admit and I've barely scratched the surface.  Recommend ;)
---
That is very true.  But it can be very tough to tell in big fights.  I wish there was a video that showed the animations for all these skills that I could study
---
Am I a moron, because I legit can't tell what on earth you're trying to say.
---
Hundreds of possibilities  that really boil down to seeing like a couple metabattle builds per class
---
As a sidenote. Core game is a bit old and not every asset got any graphical treatment (some did). On the other hand, expansion content looks much better.
---
The same about skills. Older armies have poorer textures and more visible skill sprites are quite pixelated but as if you notice skills from elite classes and expansion they all looks great and sharp. For example old guardian symbols vs new flashy firebrand skill effects or old mantras (mesmer) versus newest (firebrand again).
---
They should have renamed this now useless trait "Always Shwifty". And the new warrior should be named Always Shwifty Rick, Always Shwifty Morty....
---
Or Balth isn't actually dead, somehow. Even though we watched him horrifically explode and be consumed by Kralk and Aurene.
---
I was trying to poke fun on all of those posts that get more attention by mentioning on the title that the artist is the poster's gf. I guess it's not as funny as I thought it would be. I'll go to my corner now.
---
Lol or use 10 minute mail and never deal with that nonsense
---
Don't be silly. Revenants don't have full-head face coverings. That's obviously a Ritualist.
---
You play pvp. If you get killed, you demand a nerf on the forums what is so difficult about that?
---
I hope this post kills all these kinds of posts. This place used to remove posts like these and memes. smh
---
Do you have some place I could buy your art? Would really hang this on my walls, anet should hire you.
---
I wouldnt be surprised someone would make this as a tatoo.
---
The combat system, as for all mmos to be honest, is too broad and complex for the casual playerbase. 
---
Hardly something unknown or new. The issue is we continue to add complexity and, more importantly, increase the pacing at which combat works. 
---
Keep in mind anet, just like many players, has plain given up at the performance aspect of the game. They plain dont care about performance. They care about how things feel. And so do most players.
---
Unfortunately ignoring something doesn't make it go away. Players still want good (enough) performance for their loot. Pvp, by nature of competition, is always performance based. Many groups care about performance. Some players enjoy performance.
---
Ignoring the complexity as something they cant fix or balance, while adding powercreep cause feelgood has made these issues worse.
---
Pvp and wvw arent part of anets long term vision and most players that enjoyed these aspects have left. Frankly, its anets loss in my opinion. But I dont see them rectifying this after 6 years of mismanagement.
---
on the other hand, your video gave me three songs to add to my playlist :) do you perhaps have a list of your own somewhere that you'd be willing to share?
---
impressive work on the solo by the way, I've yet to get into cms but it sure looks exciting. maybe if I don't figure out how to find a group to learn with I'll just try and learn to solo it too haha
---
Honestly, I think I might like an ele elite spec that is designed around camping in a single attunement...maybe increasing the attunement CD significantly...or inverting it so that the attunements you're not in are always off CD and offer tool belt-esque skills when you're not using them, but when you switch to a new attunement, you're locked into it for a significant CD time.
---
After that CD expires, you get your ability to swap back, but you get a unique attunement buff that constantly pulses for you as long as you stay in it, plus that attunement's tool belt skill is replaced with a low CD, more powerful skill.
---
So like, you switch from air to fire. The icon for fire goes on a 20s CD, but water, air, and earth all have little skills above them that are active during this time frame. 
---
After 20s, the fire icon turns into the fire attunement skill, like a signet, that pulses might, and can be activated for some sort of high damage effect, but your attunement swap ability goes on CD again.
---
To swap attunement, wait till fire is off CD, then use any other element's tool belt skill, which opens up the other elements to swapping.
---
Dx12 is Win10 and supported gfx cards only.
---
well kid,core guard do about same dmg every 6 sec,for about 5 years,power mesmer can burst for 20k for  5 years and ofc kids like you found out that WAR can to same shit,only  10x worse,since he cant blink to you thru wall,or burst you from invis. i guess you are bronze than,my mistake.
---
They chose to have the item itself drop as incentive for people to run dungeons because there's less incentive to run dungeons if people can just craft the gear and sell it on the tp.
---
Thank you for the answer
---
This is absolutely insane. The level of class knowledge this must take, along with the determination, time, and pure skill invested.
---
If I may ask: in a low man such as this, is it worse to break bars or is it simply not worth it with the CC available to only one person?
---
Please proof read your nonsense before submitting. There’s not a single point in that entire mess.
---
Learn how game design works before criticising it.
---
One person getting a recipe drop means 100s of people no longer have incentive to run the content.
---
One person getting an item means at most one person no longer has incentive to run the content.
---
The latter is far better as an incentive for people to run dungeons.
---
Im using the Roccat Nyth. Maybe that would be an good Option for u.
---
holy crap bro! this is a so much cool compilation, get my upvote!!!

jon snow, kratos, obelix, yoda, tormund, dick dastardly, grey worm, nazgûl, dexter and marvin, is my favorites xd
---
Is there any chance that we will get old Coloseum back? I really like pvp and Coloseum was my fav map which work perfectly, but now its just painful to play. I dont remember i had lag like that in pvp for a long time.
---
Is guild wars 2 auto detecting bad words said in chat? I was in a solo instance typing stuff to an npc and the next day i got suspended. Their reason was «using offensive words towards another player» but i was all alone
---
Ahhh yes, because the items crafted by recipes which still drop are just vendor trash.
---
Let’s just agree to disagree, seeing as you’re illogical, nonsensical and completely fail to comprehend that Anet can do wrong.
---
I'd say condi fb is better cuz higher dps between the 2. And you haven't met really bad pugs that you have to solo last phase, I don't think power fb could do the same with bad instabilities on top. Condi is much cheesier.
---
This post breaks... several subreddit rules, so either the mods are asleep/busy, or they agree with it and think that fanart is stupid
---
Power is always better in open world apart from a couple of builds that focus on burning and a couple of builds that are far more durable than their power equivalents.
---
Classes are mostly balanced for similar long-term dps. That means condi only does it's peak damage after the full duration of one of it's conditions has finished. This is often 10-20 seconds, and almost no mobs live that long.
---
they hide in metal bawkses.
---
awesome, thanks
---
FoW (as well as UW and GoA) were more like elite dungeons, elite maps. They were completely different from GW2 raids.
---
I would love to see FoW (or more of UW) as the same kind of map/dungeon we had in GW1. A very difficult are/map with a certain quest/event chain, a whole map of enemies (not only 3-4 bosses) and punishment for failing (wipe -&gt; end of the instance).
---
visit anet at a convention, or set up notifications for all of their social medias, so you do not miss out on the first few hours of giveaways/promotions before they run out of codes/infrastructure breaks down/conditions get changed 🙃
---
Guardian is a great pick for sPvP and WvW but it'll be hard to gear for WvW. 
---
Mesmers are a great pick for sPvP, either as Condi Mirage or Bunker Chrono. In WvW, Chronos are usually taken by commanders for the stealth, pull, and gravity well.  
---
Necro absolutely smashes in both sPvP and WvW. Relatively easy to gear a Power Scourge for WvW.  
---
Ranger is fine in sPvP but has trouble in WvW. You can always roam as a Power Soulbeast but you won't be well received in zergs. However, the special mode WvW coming up this weekend is favored for Rangers as you can quickly burst down unsuspecting players from range and it'll instantly kill them as opposed to downing them. Will be pretty funny to see people getting ganked on their Warclaws to full dead in 3 seconds.
---
&gt;Berserk mode now applies a stacking debuff to the player that will apply a flat 33% reduction in all healing, -300 toughness, -304 armor (making ascended heavy equal to ascended light) and -180 vitality, with each stack doing a percentage of the players health per second
---
The debuff will do increased damage per stack, starting with each stack doing .1% of a players health at 1 stack and capping out at 30 stacks with each stack doing .166% of the players health per second. However, each second spent in berserk will apply a buff that increase the players damage to all targets by 1% per stack capping out at 30 stacks as well.
---
Oh god no.
---
&gt;Stacks of the berserk debuff can be removed by using rage skills
---
This isn't gonna make me start using rage skills, this is gonna make me stop playing Berserker.
---
also water 2! :D
---
Since nobody has mentioned it, this could be potentially game breaking, just imagine having a berserker and a dedicated healer or two, there would be no reason to ever stop raging (potentially a big buff for raids/fracs). Otherwise this would be percieved as a big nerf in the general pve, reason being that berserker doesnt have many heals and lets face it, nobody plays a healer/support when doing dungeons, bosses, metas etc. So the whole change would basically punish players for wanting to play the class as it would be meant to be played.
---
the blue highlights really make it stand out!
---
For me it's actually the opposite
---
To be fair, he will miss LS1, which was awesome.
---
I thought it was funny
---
I thought it was only poking fun at really shitty fanart
---
In that regard I think starting off with weaver is a bad idea. I am definitely not saying people shouldn't start with weaver. If they are going to stay glued to a fixed rotation then it won't matter what they start with. On the other hand if you are going the improvisation route then weaver feels very much like it expects you to be very familiar with elementalist already
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
pig! i have called my pig "bearpig" and now my human male can fuse into "manbearpig"
---
never felt so satisfied and completed
---
Base game should keep you plenty busy till you save up for more if you decide to buy expansions which I recommend because they add tons of new stuff.
---
I am almost the exact same way.  4 5 6 are a bit tough to get to, but those are reserved for the longer cooldowns.  I can comfortably get to 1 2 3 on the Naga, so i rarely use em, but i try to bind them to something more utility based, like maybe WvW, or the map, etc.  The nice thing about the Naga is the mouse wheel tilt left and right...thats 2 extra buttons on top.  I have a Scimitar as well and the movable side buttons are nice, but the mouse is just a click without the extra tilt buttons.  Sticking with this one until it breaks and then swap over.  I fingertip all the way, so need a smaller mmo mouse as well.
---
Why use font so small? Go up 10 sizes.
---
Now I'm not sure if you have small hands or I have big one, because I use my G600 as claw grip and I have no issues.
---
I just can't get used to use the G18~G20 buttons, but the rest is totally fine.
---
When I was younger I went through Logitech mice like candy (6 or so of them just the MX5 series... some I wore the color down on) but I literally grew out of them. All the Logitechs are now too small for my hands. Been using Razer Deathadder since 12 years now (replacing it about every 2-3 years because the Razer quality is meh, lol). Dont need a frikking phone dial pad on it, I just have dodge and weaponswap on the thumb, thats enough for me.
---
Yeah but all of us miss LS1, paying for the expacs won't change that
---
ok so Sic 'em does give 40% bonus damage?  I couldn't find any sort of confirmation on that on the wiki last time I checked.
---

---
It's what the skill says iirc. I'm not that much into theory crafting, so I'm not bothering if the bonus is down tuned while merged.
---
E. G. If ANet says "now that you are merged you are only 50% pet, so you get only 50% of its bonus!" it would only be a 20% boost
---
That's a nice amount of SS yeah ! But still, we need the fury/vigor uptime I guess. Plus the "all stat" bonus is not really needed compare to power and bonus duration.
---
I'd say 80% of the content is in expansions but there's still alot to do in core game
---
im going thru the same thing right now, as in needing someone to play with, 
---
Decim.5190 is my id in game, discord is Rafu#3801
---
Can we just leave Berserker alone?
---
I swear, they finally give it some attention and everyone is posting their radical balance suggestions when people like me enjoy it very much the way its been for the last few years.
---
I'd pick Power Scourge for WvW for sure. Scourge works great for sPvP as well. Best part is they are fairly similar, and you only need to gear the WvW one.  
---
The second one really depends on your preferred play style in PvP. Do you want to support? Team fight? Roam? 1v1 Duel? Bunker? Check metabattle for the current meta PvP builds that match your play style.  
---
Scourges are somewhat squishy so they are almost always paired with a support Firebrand in both PvP or WvW. You can play Scourge as a support in PvP as well, but I recommend the dps one.
---
It's surprisingly good for how old the content is by now. The maps are solid and the level system makes it so that you will see plenty of max level characters still going about their day on the core maps available to you. Many of the updates apply to older maps as well; there is an ongoing story event right now across some maps that are actually available to free players as much as expansion buyers. This game also has some of the most friendly open world community out there - expect to get help out of nowhere and feel free to ask around about things (but also consult the wiki, it's a good reference for most entry topics).
---
All in all my recommendation is to just make a character and go through the whole process of exploring maps and doing story until it's level 80, and by then you'll know whether or not this is for you without having invested yourself too much. Do not rush or look for XP grind places, leveling your first character is an integral part of the experience and will be worth it every second, trust me. The game does a really good job into empowering you slowly enough yet giving enough of the carrot on the stick to get you to keep going. And like I said you will be participating in fresh content directly with veteran players without being at any sort of disadvantage, and feel like you are actually contributing every single time (the maps have level caps and characters are de-leveled if they join a lower cap map, while still getting rewards on par with their level).
---
Like I said, that's just my opinion. I never once said it was indeed a fact but my own personal experience, take that for what you will. Do you not know what an opinion is? Apparently not.
---
Yes

I don't think Tyria has *invented* polystyrene, but it's made out of oil so I suppose it's a Necromancer problem if it exists.

I wasn't.  Was explaining why the pack exists at all.  It's no different that the server supporting battle passes of other games.
---
Wasnt the "EU" Part of promotion that egg we all got in the end?
---
A T4 Verdant Brink run needs to start right when night falls, which is at Even:45 server time.  Look for an LFG 5-10 minutes before then, and if none is up start one yourself.
---
Killing all five bosses isn't nearly enough for T4, you need to defend the camps throughout the zone repeatedly as the night progresses.  It's not an event geared towards a single tag with a zerg following it, players should be splitting into groups of 2-5 and covering the various camps, defending them from the attacks they'll face each ten minutes or so.  Between attacks, they can run supplies to upgrade defenses, re-take any camps that fall, escort soldiers who are isolated, and defeat rampaging Mordrem.  All of those things will progress the meta slightly, but with 20 groups of players doing them together, it adds up.
---
So basically, show up early before the night starts, find the right map to do it on, ensure the players split up, and then play the game.  It's a unique meta because it splits the players up far more than a normal meta would.
---
The bosses is actually the easiest part. To get to t4 you need people around defending the camps in the first half. Enough to get to around tier 2.5
---
Sometimes you have to put in the work to get something you want, bud. Or you pay someone to do the work for you. Such is life.

Angry marines and a demotivator format? Is this 2008?
---
There was nothing salty in that reply, also you're just assuming they downvoted you when it could be anyone and there's no way to know.
---
I'm sorry but the only salt/anger I see here is in your comments.
---
I'd honestly say you'd have better luck going LB/great sword for open world, that thing is a beast to swing. The only 3 options you have for dual wielding main hand are axe, sword, and dagger. Axe is ranged, so your LB kinda covers that.. dagger requires you to have PoF expansion, and is condi based sooo.. not the best choice if you're going LB as well. And sword.. well, yeah that's your only option then, and IMO it's just always been a wonky weapon.
---
Most likely made these available worldwide because they're pretty worthless.

Dev comment regarding making promotions that will included EU.
---
I did this last year and it got tons of traction too, mods didn't remove it then either. I guess no-one can define effort, lol.
---
My mate has the same issue. Day one of PoF we all tried to play together but he kept DCing during the story missions. Ended up quitting for like 6 months or something, came back and it worked.
---
Up until the S4E3 - same issue, same PC, same everything. And he's stopped playing again because of it.
---
It's a shame, I've read multiple threads about it in the past on Reddit and on the forums so it's not a completely unknown issue. The fact they haven't fixed the issue(s) yet is pretty shit when they put so much emphasis on the story in GW2.
---
This, basically. A camp does not need more than three people covering it, but you need to cover most camps until the bosses spawn. If there's not a certain degree of organisation on your map or if people don't understand the meta and blob at the commander, the likelihood of reaching T4 is close to 0.
---
Why play the pet-merging focused elite spec and complain about the pet being sometimes gone in its physical form? It's as legitimate to like the spec as it is to dislike it, but I don't get why you try to frame it as some sort of ill design, just because it does not meet your personal preference.
---
&gt;in gw2
---
As opposed to all the other games this subreddit is about?
---
We've seen more posts recently about disconnects during story missions.  Repair is a great first step, he could also try -clientport 443 to make sure game traffic isn't given low priority.
---
Other redditors have also recommended:
---
* Continuously press skill buttons during cutscenes to keep connection alive.
---
* Have a muted youtube video or stream running in the background.
---
* Try connecting through different means. (Commonly, change from Wireless to Wired.)
---
* Reset your Router, and double-check router settings to give priority to GW2.
---
The original Naga would have been perfect for you, i guess - it is quite a bit smaller than the current variants. Even though i dislike their size, i keep choosing Naga over others because of the buttons... no other MMO mouse i tried has well spaced out buttons. The Steelseries Rival 500 features a very unfortunate sloped design, the angled buttons have unfitting pressure points, otherwise its a cool mouse because of the modular thumb pad. Corsair Scimitar and many others like it have a too flush button surface, i can't distinguish one button from another and end up fat-fingering the wrong or multiple buttons.
---
There is difference between reporting 3 year old bug (is it really tho?) 
---
and
---
&gt;Anet is not interested in fixing bugs
---
We all "know" how many were working on GW2 before layoffs. They were intrested doing new content rather than going around core maps fixing random old content that isnt part of some collection. Its just how it was and probably is.
---
&gt; also you're just assuming they downvoted you when it could be anyone and there's no way to know.
---
Downvote and comment came at the same time...
---
condi quickbrand &gt; power quickbrand. It's one of those condi bursts that pulls quick and high. Condi quickbrand is almost 9k more dps than its power part. Plus, if the group has a dh, it'll also up their damage cuz the the burning always up.  
---
If group is bad at dps, bad at boons, bat at cc, even more reason to run condi tbh. I don't leave when group is bad. Sadly this is partly the reason why pugs are the way they are when people think they're better and just leave in the middle of the run. I usually spend an extra 1-3 mins telling group what's wrong and switch in/out a different utility and what everyone could bring to help the group run. Much much faster than leave and start over.
---
It is run by Anet. Dialog translation, patch notes translation, VA, all the stuff is done by anet. Anet controls everything in game except our website mall.
---
Petty. I like it.
---
Dawn I guess my mind is stuck on the oooold intelligence sigil so I did not give a try to this ! Going for it. I have to admit I gave not enough research on gear.
---
I was totally about choosing self deception (love it) but went for the renewing oasis for condis.. but I think your right cause I feel like after an GS opening burst u usually reposition with jaunt before sword ambushing. Self D making the clone you need to chain CC.
---
Thx a lot dude !
---
When it comes to rpg there are few types. One were more common in the past, where you could literally make hero bad skill-wise so it was impossible to progress, then there were those super easy where with new skills you just become more powerful.
---
Guild Wars is something in between.
---
Technically you cannot make permanently broken hero because skill reset is free and instant any time. On the other hand it require you to learn all mechanics behind game and remember them good enough to make your traits usefull. It sound hard? But I don't think it is. At least not every time.
---
Here comes our necro who have huge advantage over other classes is this matter. Huge HP pool, second HP bar, ability to leech life when downed too and straightforward traits. Also minion army drawing some aggro and some fear abilities for disengage. Of course you don't know it without playing or reading all skills and traits on wiki before making hero (that's why you ask and we amswer).
---
Once gw2 had different trait system where investing points have you stats, so you could see what specialisation increase toughness, power or such. This system is no more but the idea behind specialisations remained mostly the same. Older players may remember this, new players may have no idea for example what is warrior discipline or tactic? Necro spite? 
---
And so, spite was for power, curses for condi, blood magic healing, death magic toughness and soul reaping improved shroud mechanic.
---
About extra specialisation and those 10points per hero. You don't need it at the start because core class gets enough points to be maxed at 80lv, also HP points are easier to do solo in PoF areas. What's more it may be enough for long time to stay as core necro, and maybe invest in reaper. Scourge is more advanced and it completely lose shroud mechanic so no second HP bar. Still worth to try one day.
---
I actually really liked Scarlet as our villain.
---
sure
---
To clarify the above comment, the regions in GW2 (NA, EU) act like servers do in other games. Servers in GW2 are more like choosing a team. WvW is the only place that what server team you're on will affect your game. In the future, the intention from Anet is to make it so that instead of server determining your team, it will be your guild and their alliances.
---
That's some strong denial you got there.
---
That’s a really strong case you got there.
---
ahhh I see you, kindred Fresh Air weaver
---
may you ever be tapping earth for cc phases unlike our cursed bolt to the heart brethren
---
Yup.
---
That video was very helpful, thank you!
---
The government is not your parents.  
---
What this kind of paternalistic regulation does - to use your analogy - is to prohibit anyone from having a relationship because someone might have a bad one.  It's not just misguided, it's oppressive and authoritarian.
---
If buying something is harmful for you or your circumstances, be a human being who is responsible for their own actions and choose not to buy.  If you can't be trusted with the decision, then it's reasonable for you to seek help.  And if a government wants to provide help for people who are "victims" in this way, then there's a case to be made for that.
---
What is **not** reasonable is for you to force your preferences on others with the threat of violence.  It's pathological.
---
Correct.
---
Not to be confused with the easily graspable jar with a slightly opened lid on top of the Grenth status in the GW2 Beta. I still do not know what this was about.
---
Yes, that is what it says.
---
Rented , I'm in college and work a minimum wage job, i can pay for it but will have to eat instant noodles for the rest of the month
---
I'm entirely certain that this is a problem with certain routers, usually those provided by ISPs. I'm not entirely sure what happens, but I think it might have something to do with dropping a number of packets, or perhaps buffer on the router itself.
---
I was with Virgin Media (UK) who provided their own router for their broadband, and it took me quite a long time to discover that there were a number of threads on their official forums of people complaining about frequent disconnects in certain MMOs. Some of them were WoW related, others specified exactly the issue your friend is having, disconnecting during story instances. I had this problem too; I believe the fix might be to buy a better router, but I have yet to test it out myself so I'm not 100% certain that it will work.
---
I'm on a different ISP at the place I currently live at and can play through all instances without a disconnect, but on Virgin Media on their SupeHub router I had serious issues, to the point where I would just avoid the story entirely because of it.
---
This is all just a theory, as I haven't tested it out myself on Virgin Media just yet. If your friend is able to perhaps borrow a router from someone and see if that fixes it, I would be interested to see if this is indeed the issue at hand.
---
You forgot what sub you are on :p
---
Yeah I’ll look to metabattle. Idk what I fully wanna do for PvP yet so I guess can’t answer that part but hopefully that helps me make a decision because I’m being very indecisive haha.  How’s the leveling for these 2? (And thanks for answering all my questions btw)
---
If you love cheese then Longbow Soulbeast.
---
While I like the condi mitigation, duration is rarely the problem in WvW because you're not a raid boss; everyone just runs Grieving and stacks to 25 in seconds. The only solution is knowing when to Jaunt.
---
[Here](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQNAsaRnELDlphFoBmoBMMjFVDrsDUCGA+FwFYEkMAMCKOA-jhCHQBhRHwaVCiW1KGwhAgfPAgWs/AAODAAR5HIUVJCaDAA-e) is a build I've been running in PvE and WvW, mostly as a meme. The thing that's nice about it is I can run my Raid Chrono build and feel less bad about having 30% crit chance. I don't need to tell you that if you're serious about WvW DON'T RUN THIS. IT'S BAD. But it's good enough for camp flipping, and sometimes I catch people with Magic Bullet into stupid burst. 
---
To tryhard you can take Mirror Images and Signet of Illusions: with two clones out charge Mantra &gt; p4 &gt; p5 &gt; dodge &gt; s1 ambush (lunge) &gt; swap &gt; signet &gt; buffer shatter &gt; mirror images &gt; gs5 &gt; shatter &gt; gs4...3... etc. etc.
---
This combo gives you two full 3-clone shatters with 12-17 might, 100% crit, plus 50% damage from Mental Anguish trait, 25% from Superiority Complex, and potentially more from Fragility. It also hits up to five targets in a small radius!
---
Nope
---
Really love your art style
---
水？
---
Look on LFG, right after reset theres a guild that runs T4 VB. You can also try and get some people and command, I got 2 T4 VBs last night, its all about communication.
---
there are 4 WvW maps, Eternal Battlegrounds in the center and 3 Borderland maps. Each borderlands is primarily owned by one of the three servers, with the other two servers owning small camps on those maps.
---
Going on your own, or roaming, is an okay idea but probably not a great idea for someone who doesn't know the game mode very well. Join your server's teamchat and see if there is anyone commanding for your server at the time. 
---
The basis of WvW is a node war. Different nodes award different amounts of points if you hold them when points are awarded (every 5 minutes).
---
Camps give the least, but are also the easiest to take. These can be taken by 1 person pretty easily
---
Towers are the middle, and an undefended tower can be taken by 3-4 people pretty easily
---
Keeps are the highest tier, with stonemist castle (eternal battlegrounds) being the largest. These generally require more people, and you will generally approach these with a squad
---
If there's no commanders present and it's a pretty slow time for your server, you can just steal some camps or look for other roaming players to kill. It's not the most interesting thing ever, but that's pretty much the extent of what you can easily do solo
---
Power Scourge (using mostly Marauder's with some Cavalier's mixed in). It's for zerg ONLY.   
---
For roaming, I'd suggest Holosmith and Mirage from your list.
---
For years I used the Logitech G502. I seriously can't recommend that mouse enough, great if you have small to medium sized hands (I wear a men's size small glove). Just last week I purchased the steel series rival 500. I was unsure about the fit for my hand, but after a day of use I don't think I can go back. The button placement for everything is damn near perfect.
---
As far as traditional MMO button grid mice, if you're having trouble reaching some of the more forward thumb keys, you might want to try the Corsair Scimitar Pro. It has an adjustable thumb button grid.
---
Personally I steer clear of the thumb grid button mouse as it's just too easy to click the wrong button when you're in the zone
---
I typically just have a few weapon abilities on my mouse and then everything else bound to easy to hit on reaction keys. No keyboard yoga for me

Ah, cool. Makes more sense than forcing players to track down the guy who sells the food. Especially when the food is time limited.
---
Do you mean the death/nazgul one?
---
You mean after daily and challenges reset?
---
Glad to be of service :D
---
Whoops.  Yes!  My bad....
---
I've really been enjoying the new Sc/W tempest build.
---
Idk if its as high damage but it feels really fun, I'm way more familiar with it, and tempest is way better than weaver when you need to carry imo just because the nature of attuning in weaver means you can't really swap right into an "oh shit" button.
---
&gt; Join your server's teamchat and see if there is anyone commanding for your server at the time.
---
If there's someone commanding and I can see it on the map, but not saying anything should I go to them? Guess they're taking areas?
---
&gt; If there's no commanders present and it's a pretty slow time for your server, you can just steal some camps or look for other roaming players to kill.
---
Cool, so just roam around taking and killing - and get points to buy things from the store. What's the easiest way to get a mount? 
---
Also - can I enter and leave WvW at any time?
---
Qui-Gon's face is so look alike you now have to rush Mai Trin fractal with your party being stuck between the energy barriers.
---
&gt;The goal should be to raise the standards in PvP communities, not to lower your own standards.
---
Do you think people should be banned for BM? Thats what OPs reaction was, they wanted anet to take action against a player that spammed a finisher move on them. I agree be the change you want to see, but i for one do not want people to be banned for a bit of BM. That imo would be unacceptable.
---
I thought daredevil was overshadowed by other DPS builds like Power Dragonhunter?
---
I was on hiatus that entire time. Only played the first mission. *shrugs* Was really confused who these new characters were and why I cared haha
---
Yes sir! :)
---
Cursed keybind but here goes:
---
Tab heal, Q dodge, WER movement (strafe left, move forward, strafe right), T interact
---
12345 weapon skills, FDSA utility skills (F aimed skills like Blink, A elite)
---
After that, G mount, f1-f5 default, mouse buttons for targeting and Show Enemy Names
---
this is great news to hear! I was nervous I had to swap everything, I guess it's good to know I can be a better player and it's not my gear or build bringing me down. Thanks!
---
And that's actually funny having a character camping for daily matriarch!!
---
&gt; Also for y’all thinking about spoiling Endgame, don’t do it

People react just as viscerally to spoilers of books they want to read. It’s more apparent for books turned into movies. Also, the convenience of having a series condensed into 3 hours and then people blatantly ruining it makes the desire to read/watch the books/movie drastically fall.
---
Just so you know, spoilers in /say chat are allowed. You could get banned for spamming.

She was fucking amazing. People just don't understand what a Mary Sue is and parrot the same nonsensical meme day in and day out. I specifically fell in love with the combination of the Harley-Quinn-esque chaos combined with the methodical pragmatism of an engineer.

I kind of thought it was an FFXIV cosplay at first, but no, I see the GW2 core there.

Muted, yes. But what I said was, “everyone do your part to effort out people trying to spoil Endgame.” Meaning you and 5 others see a spoiler, type into chat a quick couple letters to push up the spoiler out of the chat boxes.
---
LFG is your way to join a map with players planning to do the meta.  Whether it's starting one yourself or looking through the listings for ones already there.  If people are actively trying it, they'll be listing it in LFG to attract others with the same goal so it can succeed.  If you see nothing on LFG in the leadup to night-time, then there just might not be people actively trying at that time.
---
As mentioned above, after reset is a good time to check.
---
Female Asura holosmith engineer, big dark red eyes, short dark red dreadlocks with a kelly green hair band.  Go to it!  I hope for a master piece.  Her name is Pinky Aldar, so thematically, I think you can guess her dress code.  Utility, not sexy btw.
---
Generally speaking that's true, but Daredevil has been meta on at least a handful of bosses for a while.

Other than the automatic mute, I'm not sure if mutes are an actual thing in the game. It seems that abusive chatters do just get small suspension.

This is a great list of abilities! Thanks so much, I clearly need to improve my playing and understand how much is actually at my disposal, I usually block once or twice before thinking I am out of options. Will need to remember all of this utility chrono has! That's why I love playing it and have barely touched it haha. Thanks so much for doing this write up, you have inspired me to just be a better chrono and not blame the gear
---
Also with only 1 race we could get more armors because they wouldn't have to design 1 armor for all races everytime (and btw most of the time it looks shitty on half of them)
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
You need the xpacs to be able to raid, but you -don't- need it to run fractals. That being said, there's only a few base class builds I can think of being viable atm, so it does limit ya a bit.
---
Assuming that you're getting fine and masterwork gear primarily, I'd compare the price per item estimated [here](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/tp/search?name=Piece%20of%20Unidentified%20Gear) and [here](https://silverwastes.loltools.net/). I'd go with the bag opener, still, myself.
---
some dickhead posted a spoiler in mapchat, i blocked and reported for spam. thankfully i already saw the movie to avoid this problem
---
This movie is so fucking overrated its actually makes me want to spoil as much as I can. Like seriously how can such an average movie get such hype?
---
Blood legion are the ones with the most defectors to flame legion, since they are more tempted with promises of power, and you are likely to find charr that use mesmer or necromancer tricks among ash.
---
We just happen to start in the Iron capital. Iron may use magic tools or devices that manipulate magic, but spellcasters are not trusted over there. Too much shaman baggage.

The Naga 2012 was perfect for claw grippers with the smallest side plate. I'm using a trinity now and I'm mostly used to it but it just feels huge. I'm hoping the next version has both the trinity side plates and the sizing side plates of the original.
---
I mean.. you ever play DnD before? Humans have to be the most flexible, because they're kinda weak walking meat bags. Good at a little of everything, certainly not strong like Norn/Charr. Certainly not tech adepts or nature enthusiasts like Asura and Sylvari, but can dip into anything really.
---
I do think it's a bit of a stretch to think that Charr are only steam punk cats who distrust magic, that's just a stereotype. It'd be like looking at DR and saying "All humans are cowardly nobles or thieving low borns." Naw man, you got the zephyrites, you got the canthans and elonians, yada yada.. I'd like to think the same goes for all races, and we saw that with the Charr too, they have a city of druidic family lovers, a near polar opposite to the stereotype.
---
Even before that though, one of the warband members you can pick up for a Charr is a mesmer, and it works for his person just fine, being a saucy loose cannon sorta dude.
---
End of the day it's really just perspective and preference I guess but still.
---
I heard spiderman dies and the joker wins in the end.
---
same info on expansion discounts would be great!
---
Yup.  When something really good comes out in the Gem Store, the rates for Gold -&gt; Gems gets bad.
---
Instead of making a pointless whiny post on Reddit you could spend time actually learning the game instead.
---
I guess that makes a lot of sense, because the prices change compared to how much gold/gems there are all together. Thank you!
---
Dear God yes... I remember us having to 100% those and just getting killed randomly by roaming groups.
---
Is WvW still fun and full?
---
I stopped playing 5 years ago but was a hc nolifer since launch. I finally have a PC again and want to jump right back in.
---
Most of my enjoyment of the game came from organized roaming in WvW. I was in a guild that ran groups of 10-20 built to zerg stomp(up to 50-60 enemies). If you remember Red Guard then you know what could be achieved by a low amount of skilled players with complimenting builds. I'll be looking for a similar guild if it's available. Thanks for your time and responses
---
*Logan uses 'Retreat!'*
---
I'm in this camp. As a beta gw1 player, humans were always the focal point of Tyrian stories. Now we have no focal point because they want to cover everything and everyone.
---
To answer your question directly, not that I've heard, or there isn't one that is actively advertised. Server discords are probably going to be your best bet; there may be WvW oriented guilds with their own discord that facilitates the information you're looking for, but I haven't heard of just a general WvW discord across all servers.
---
It makes me sad that I can only upvote this once.
---
They could bring back Golem Week in WvW.  I miss those kamikaze Omega bombs from the top floor of SM.  Fun times.
---
* Try it out. It's free to play with minimal restrictions until level 80. This is the core game that all the release players had for years so there is tons to do before you pay a dime.
---
* As soon as you decide it's worth investing your time in, go ahead and buy both expansions in a combo so you save a little money (usually) and have access to the entire mastery system. Make sure to use an authorized retailer.
---
* Everyone encourages new players to not use a level 80 boost because there is no substitute to learning the game by leveling and playing. This is true, but at a certain point, make your own decision, but keep this perspective in mind and consider going back to your non-80s to get a grip on the combat. Expansions are designed for players who know their class and they'll rock you if you don't give any consideration to your build.
---
* Metabattle is a great site to find builds on when you're starting. Most of the time when you see benchmarks and builds discussed on the subreddit, they are for high end content with clearly definded roles aimed at min/maxing. Don't worry about this for now.
---
* Racial story ends at level 30, order story ends at level 60, but you can go to any area you want when you're leveling. Explore and try completing a map. Doing this and stumbling upon orange events in the open world is a big part of GW2. If you don't like this playstyle thats fine and you can still have fun here, but its a very common playstyle with lots of achievable goals when you're newer.
---
* Find a guild. The social aspect of this game and playing in groups is really great. If you decide that's not your style it's ok, but I really encourage you to try a few guilds. Plenty will be recruiting in low-level areas but remember that you'll have communication restrictions (anti-bot/anit-spam) until you pay for your account.
---
* Traits, weapon types, stats all synergize. When leveling, power is usually more effective, but condi can also be a lot of fun. Make sure you pick one or the other because hybrid is really non-optimal except for PvP game modes or some balanced level 80 open world builds for beginners. 
---
* Sever only matters for WvW. Go there and try it once it is unlocked. Running in groups with the correct builds is really important so look up a build online first please.
---
* All traits can be reset and all items can be reskinned. You'll be short on these options while leveling, but by 80 it's very flexible so don't worry about things too much or save points for later.
---
Welcome to Tyria! Hope this was helpful to read and that you have a lot of fun!
---
&gt;Often players will complain about the abundance of human characters in GW2. 
---
I think you're just pulling things out of your ass to prove an already very obvious point.

Kodash as a single server, Aba+Dzago together. Would recommend Kodash, but probably stays full
---
Stephen likes it hot and Dormy likes it strange.

You can also check the gem price over time [on this website](https://fr.gw2tp.com/gems), it keeps track of the past and current gem price and refreshes very often. A great tool in case you are wondering how low/high the gem price may be. Keep in mind that you shouldn't be check the gem price from years ago, since they will never be as low as before ^(I miss the good old times...).
---
Awesome, will take a look at those. Thanks!
---
Hello I am a new player and was wondering which server to play on, I want a populated world.
---
Iirc historically the prices go down on tuesdays and fridays (probably related to payroll/checks) for day over day variation.
---
As for strategically, just buy them when they are cheap compared to the past quarter. And know that the price is likely to only ever increase as time goes on.
---
Thank you very much for that imformation!
---
Sooo: time to allow underage driving, gambling, drinking because you know the gouvernment are not your parents amirite.
---
Norn males have oddly skinny lower bodies, I find. And armour always looks so oversized on Slyvari males.
---
No no its fine. I am just interested in the wordmap generated posts that you mentioned.
---
Is that you tilted?
---
I'm an EVA commander and this is spot on.  Roughly half the 20 camps held will get you to tier 2.5 or so before the bosses.  Killing the bosses will get the map to tier 4.  If in the US, we run this meta daily to T4 weekday mornings on NA.  It's the last of a 5 meta train that starts about 7:00 AM CST.

They are free but at the time, of course, they were premium content. They don't hold a candle to expansion content (which isn't very expensive anyway) although there isn't much risk to try it as it stands. :)
---
ctrl+f'd scar to the greatest disappointment
---
He's still not asking about the forum, but the theme.
---
&gt; I've really been enjoying the new Sc/W tempest build.
---
Funny coincidence, I actually just tried it about now in fractals. Lots of boons, seems like a fun support, "rotation" is pretty smooth too.
---
Yes, and the theme is, as far as we are aware, WvW and PvP?
---
Don't discard the possibility of your friend's ISP low-prioritizing game packets or applying certain QoS policies that make the game disconnect. Try using a VPN service  for a couple of days to see if the issue gets resolved.
---
In my case, I always had disconnection problems during instances (even when I was solo'ing content) in a sporadic but consisten way, until I tried using a VPN.
---
I use a G600 but I only use the front two rows of buttons. It sounds like I have my hand farther forward on the mouse than you. I actually prefer the feel of the Razer Naga but every Razer product I've bought has been an unreliable piece of crap.
---
Just because they were allied it doesn't mean they wanted the same. Enemy of my enemy is my ally, right? Menzies could just wanted to replace Balthazar and then even leave this alliance as soon as he got what he wanted (this is pure speculation but I hope you get my point). All evil gods had different goals. 
---
For now I would put Balthazar as way worse one than Menzies simply because we don't have that much information on latter one. Former one clearly stated that he doesn't care about Tyria being destroyed as the result of killing Elder Dragons. He even used souls/dead people to make his forged army. Menzies? Him usurping Balthazar was all we know. We don't know how far he would go to achieve that and what he would do after that. Like I said, I thought there was more info on that but sadly there is not.
---
All realms in US or EU are connected, so you can play with everyone based in EU etc. but EU and US can't play together. I'd advise to stick to your continent since your ping will be huge if you choose otherwise.
---
Only game mode affected by server choice is WvW, you can look at [current rankings](https://leaderboards.guildwars2.com/de/eu/wvw) to check for any active WvW realms. I heard on EU Whiteside Ridge is currently your go-to WvW server.
---
120 fps on a 1080, and you gimp yourself with a contoller?   
---
I will never understand people
---
GW2 very much has a focus of block-and-dodge compared to other comparable games, so you need to get used to reading what enemies are doing and timing things. There's a lot of timing involved. 
---
I don't really think I learnt to play chrono well until I started tanking in raids. When you learn to watch how your enemies move, suddenly it all falls into place.
---
Mirages are differently indestructible and it's a very different style of play with teleporting, phasing through things and ambushes... if you get that far, enjoy it!
---
For most builds, you'll want a main hand sword, with a second sword, a shield and a focus as off hand weapons, depending on what you need. They're all pretty good in different ways. Shield had a block and boons, but also a fairly decent ranged attack. Focus has the pull, which you can use to put all your enemies in one place, and sword has another block. I usually run sword and shield solo and then use focus instead of sword in groups unless I have a reason not to. 
---
Greatsword is mostly good for farming. Sceptre, pistol and torch are more suited to condition damage builds (i.e. mirage) and staff isn't great for anything, but is fun to use.
---
Man when you hit the mark it's unmistakable. Bravo.
---
I don't see how an article from 2012 holds any value in this discussion.
---
I identify as a charr and this offends me.
---
Even the Flame Legion has a Citadel. The Citadel of Flame. It's a dungeon.
---
Thanks for the info :o
---
d'oh
---
I honestly have no idea, I'll tell him to try turning them down next time he's on.
---
Between your other comment below and the rest of them though there's some good info in this thread so far, I'll send him a link and get him to try some of the suggestions. Thanks!

Exotic viper's gear requires linseed oil, 10 per piece of gear. Linseed oil costs about 50 silver per, so that's about 4 gold in just the oil. For example, oiled orichalcum boot lining (for viper's) costs 2 gold, while an orichalcum boot lining (for berserker's) costs 84 copper, and that price difference is entirely just the oil
---
And if you choose to completely skip the exotic step, ascended gear requires that you make jeweled damask patches/deldrimor steel dowels. Jeweled items require the use of fulgurite, which you have to craft using non tradeable materials. You need 25 per patch, 3 patches per item, and 50 fulgurite per dowel, and each fulgurite costs obsidian shards, and materials you have to farm in the first three HoT maps. You could also buy the jeweled patches, but they're more expensive off the trading post.
---
Also, in order to actually craft viper's gear, you need to find the recipes or buy them on the trading post, and each recipe is a solid gold for the armor recipes.
---
So it's not difficult, it's just inconvenient when you take into account all the factors.
---
Somewhere around 8 months ago the low price hovered between 125-130g for 400 gems.  But now the common lowest price is 140g for 400 gems.  It gets up to 150g on Tuesdays when good items are released and usually hovers around that till Thursday before falling back down.
---
Basically it's a watch, wait and gamble to get the best return for your gold.
---
Nice white knight post man. Let me break this down for you though. 
---
• I saw the movie last night at 9:45.
---
• What I said was *my suggestion* to cover up people trying to ruin a movie people have hyped up for
---
• Covering up spoilers is apparently toxic to you, so what are people that spoil shit then?
---
• Active discussion is different than blatant ruining someone else’s anticipation.
---
I'd say there's not really a rush for your first map completion though? Like personally I think going slower by foot is a nice experience the first time. The music, environment, and general ambience are all pretty cool and a lot of fun to explore.
---
That being said, once you've Been There, Done That...you'll 200% want a mount.
---
How long would it take to get to rank 100 in pvp? I'm at 17 right now and haven't played it in like 3 years.
---
It is excellent for duelling, but I found that the dagger tetherbraker build, though good at boon stripping, dueling is great I sucked when playing against condi classes. Against scourge in particular, if they time their fear well.

Tyvm, very helpful!

Grabbed 5 codes already.

4-5 months of fun if you playing 2 hours per day.

The comments here look like a lot of people responding specifically to your charr example. Yeah, it's entirely possible to find lore within the charr world for how and why a celestial-themed mesmer would make sense; that's not really the issue so much as it is the relative ease with which you can "justify" that within the human world. In my eyes it comes down to the fact that humans as a race and as presented in the game are something we're super familiar with, so they weren't needed to be designed to "stand out" or fall into a specific trope. We as humans know about humans and their full range of things. Charr and norn and sylvari and asura, meanwhile, are unfamiliar to us, and the developers have worked to peg them more into a specific slot and defined culture. With charr, yes, there's a lot of element of magic to it and you can easily justify a necromancer or elementalist or mesmer charr; but their society has been explicitly defined for us around their technology and use of steampunk in a way which the humans really haven't had due to their familiarity to us. The norn have been put into the lone wolf supersoldier attuned-with-nature archetype, so while an engineer norn can be justified with lore examples for sure, it still takes more "justification" compared to a human engineer. So on with sylvari and asura. I think what OP's point is, which I agree with, is that since humans were already a familiar race to us, they as a race didn't need to be forced into a specific role, which as a result leaves them \_relatively\_ more open than the other races towards use for any class. All race/class combos are valid in lore in one way or another, but human have the least amount of racial lore overhead of all of the races so it can be easiest to use one of those combos without needing to find exceptions or even think about how to justify being that class at all.
---
US only? :/
---
that typo tho, "Path of Wild" haha  Time to grab some more alt and save some for friends I guess
---
And ban people too.
---
I used to think that until I got that one Chak egg sack 1.5 years ago.  GW2 life changing gold for me at the time.
---
[My gift to you](https://imgur.com/a/8kLnCCo)
---
How much gold exchanged would be considered  a good deal in order to get 200 gems?
---
Cool. I guess I should have been more specific: How is the *game itself* friendly to players? For Example, it's actually quite easy to get gear, powers, etc, in Star Trek Online, even if you're not willing to spend money. How does GW2 fair in that regard?
---
Experience the game before buying anything. Back when I started I enjoyed the game a lot, then when I got to a high level (50-60) I realised that I really liked the game so I bought both expansions. Both are really worth it and have a ton of content
---
it's a whole different game that has little to do with real "vanilla" experience, core game is free to try, not free to play.
---
Crafting is limited, spirit shards are limited, laurels are extremely limited. Trading post/Gem store becomes limited, most collections are blocked and gold gain can be... troublesome to say the least.
---
core classes (for the most part) are completely different from their elite counter parts, masteries overhaul the exploring experience as a whole to the point it feels like a different game.
---
Personal story is outdated and can feel somewhat clunky and tedious in comparison to recent additions, (this is a matter of tastes though) and **most** meta events worth mentioning are region-locked into expansion areas.
---
Chances are you will get a completely biased experience and make a completely wrong idea about how the game truly is like.   
---
Don't get me wrong, you can still play pvp to competitive levels, all fractals and dungeons, explore core tyria as a whole and complete personal story completely, game is playable, you can top the charts with core classes and get hours and hours of content. Be warned though, it's a different game.
---
**If possible, after trying out f2p, if you decide to drop the game, remember this post and give it another chance after getting expansions, you'll be surprised on how different the game is.**
---
I still get emails telling me someone is trying to access my instagram. Only thing I ever linked was the tea app for the outfit.
---
Until you hit level 80 and go to some advanced areas you won't have any problems with gear, you get optimal gear as you complete story mode or other quests. And even after that, the highest tier equipment (exotic and ascended) can be obtained free 2 play if you dedicate a bit of time into the game
---
Won't be glamorous, but it'll function.
---
The only codes/accounts disabled from the Kung Fu Tea giveaway were from people who abused it.
---
I use my alt account created from that promotion every single day for login rewards and dailies without any issue.
---
Got a code, will try tonight.  Another extra account to farm.
---
Ironically, his boy had to die to make way for a much better one. Just saying.
---
Nice. That's what I want to hear. Thanks for convincing me.
---
The best in slot gear(ascended) is some work to get, bit 1 tier below(exotic) is only 2% less on the armor. So it is almost just as good, and u van het that really easy for a few gold of the tp.
---
During leveling your gear wont mather that much. You will be able to kill evrything.
---
If u do get good gear for your present level u will feel pretty powerfull though.
---
And when you hit 80, you will probably have enouph gold from dailies to buy exotic gear from the tradingpost.
---
Also remember that the core game is free ( with some limitations to stop spam). So nothing is stopping you to hop in and see how you like it.
---
Perfection.
---
Again, because you don't like it doesn't mean everyone else has to hate it.  Nor does it entitle you to be an asshat and desire to spoil the plot for others who *DO* care.
---
You can be contrarian about Marvel all you want.  Have at it.  But you can also choose to not be a dick at the same time.
---
Maybe Norn or Charr festival.
---
About Norn, it could be focused on their  honour of fight, will to conquest and praise ancestors, or even prove them their worthy and honorable warriors. It could be fun to have side quests that are related to honour in fight. For example every time you fight 2vs1 you get less honour points, or get them taken, and 1vs1 and more are rewarded normally or better. After some interval, your honour gets calculated and you get rewards. It can be below zero! 
---
Or it could be related to char and their fierce nature. You get more points, more difference in points after your win. You lose points based on difference when you loose. 
---
No idea about wvw since it's not currently my focus.
---
I agree with; but, I can see it being really frustrating when you miss events/kills for a heart because someone with a mount runs past you and destroyed everything. At least with a raptor mount they'd be able to keep up

Make sure you click the link *after* turning on the VPN. It only works if the registration page has "Guild Wars 2*" in the banner of things you get.
---
thanks for the info!
---
Solo zhaitan? Great, you finished basic combat tutorial. Now enter any HoT map...
---
God forbid the codes actually go to new players...
---
I would be down for some plain real-animal looking mounts for norn, like an arctic wolf or a bear with just a basic fur saddle or something, as opposes to just the norn-armored versions of the base mounts we got
---
Aren't we overdue for a joke themed legendary weapon?  It's been a while since The HMS Divinity and Shoosadoo came out.  
---
Maybe it will be the Meatoberfest Skewer, basically a giant shish kaboob with succulent meat impaled on your legendary that you occasionally eat from when you're idle.  
---
Or it might be Jormag's Chocolate Banana, a frozen treat on a long stick that needs not further explanation.
---
One thing could help. Something like emclaves or lore wise places where you see unusual races and class combo. Olmakhan were great, but kinda late in game. Seeing elite class npc was awesome but it could be even better to see for example holosmith forges, where various engineers attend and learn. Maybe mesmer training zone themed like a theatre with awkward charr sitting in corner, telling stories about their parents proudly using magic like this to break stereotypes.
---
Sweet, I was about to buy PoF for my wife's new account and I'll take the savings happily.
---
Nice! Gives me Elderwood Leblanc vibes.
---
Really can't stress enough how trivially easy it is to get max stat exotic gear. You can get a full set basically for free within a few minutes of hitting max level. The better stuff (ascended) isn't really meaningfully better, it's just there as a long term goal for folks who want to have the "best". And it doesn't apply to PvP.
---
This game mostly relies on cosmetics for income. Weapon/mount skins and such. Also convenience features like more bank slots or infinite use mining tools. Those can be a bit pricey though, and if you want to buy them by converting in-game gold it is quite expensive. But you can do it entirely through in-game means if you want.
---
BREATH OF THE FIRE
---
They only wanted an e-mail, and those are easy to get.
---
Wrong. They're still in stock.
---
SMELL OF POOP
---
you can buy exp rate boosters, and if you buy either expansion you get a boost straight to max level, but the leveling process is already pretty easy compared to a lot of other MMOs so it's not personally all that worth it to spend money on boosts.
---
You can't but anything that gives you an unfair power advantage though.
---
If you like challenging and dynamic PvP, WvW is very fun mode and Necro is very fun class. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1z0WytS4tQ
---
Is there a way to receive the legacy armor sets (aside from the chestpieces) in PvE, without completing PvP/WvW reward tracks?
---
Extremely active and friendly, plus you can get the Path of Fire expansion for free if you do the Alienware giveaway.
---
Welcome!
---
[This video](https://youtu.be/Mf56mu6O4fM) has some great tips for beginners.
---
Also, try out [Action Camera](https://youtu.be/-Y2czD6BREw) if you prefer action-combat over tab-targeting.
---
I don't recall it being tedious. Remember that GW2 playerbase didn't even want mounts, it was just their amazing execution that made us fall in love with them
---
If you now deem it tedious, you've either done a lot of world completions, or the luxury of incredibly fast mount riding has rendered it so. 
---
World exploration is (for explorers) more fun on foot, since you take more time to take it all in and many of the vistas are actually little jumping puzzles.
---
Pretty sure they are now only from the [box](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legacy_Armor_Box). Didn't see them listed in wardrobe unlocks. Doing a WvW reward track really isn't that bad though especially with some boosters.
---
Looks great!
---
You sure you had the GW2 there? I think Cronos meant that under the "Register and instantly unlock:" title you have to have "Guild Wars 2\*" written. If you go from the EU page, it only says 50 ARP and 48HR arp booster (at least for me)
---
After a week or so they disabled all existing codes that have not been redeemed, then fixed the promo and handed out new ones.
---
This is a skill that only the finest of commanders can perform.
---
It is on the rise but if you could get 65-68g to 200 gems that isn't bad. It's up to 70g now but peaks more at 80g.
---
Desert King actually does have content relation to Joko (Desert King Throne literally has Awakened Canids as part of it).
---
Go back a few more sets and, in order, you have:
---
* Desert King weapon skins (released with Ep3, content related)
---
* Inquest Mark II weapon skins (released with Ep2, content related)
---
* Alchemist weapon skins
---
* Glacial weapon skins (released with wintersday, content related)
---
* Shifting Sands weapon skins
---
* War God's weapon skins (released with PoF, content related)
---
Other skins related to content of a release included Bloodstone weapons (while released 1 month after S3E1, it was related), Mordrem weapons (released with S2E8), Pact Fleet (released with S3E6), Dreamthistle weapons (released with Tower of Nightmares), Aetherized weapons (released with Sky Pirates of Tyria), and Fused weapons (released with Flame and Frost).
---
So like I said, while rare, it happens. What I said **does** have precedent to back it up. The only part that doesn't, is a BLCT weapon set being sold in gemstore.
---
Meanwhile, Immortal and Onyx/Gold Lion sets hold not relation to the story, while Branded clearly do. Furthermore, like I said before, shortly before Immortal weapons were swapped out, they were added to the wardrobe unlock.
---
Furthermore, the weekly supply thing is something never done before by ArenaNet. It isn't your typical "themed bundle" that Immortal and Onyx/Gold Lion weapons get tossed in with as a bonus. So precedences have jack shit relation to this in the end, because the very foundation of this is unprecedented for ArenaNet.
---
Just get the code yourself. I wrote a step-by-step guide [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/comments/bhrx99/pc_game_guild_wars_2_path_of_fire_us_only_see/elva2cp/). The entire process takes about 2 minutes.
---
managed to grab codes to give to my friends who wanted to play GW2 but didnt have $$ to buy PoF before all the alt makers scooped them all up, whew
---
Is this an out of season april fools joke?
---
dammit...
---
It sounds like you're going to a lower level area and as such are being downscaled. You can read all about the level adjustment [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dynamic_level_adjustment)
---
It's because of the dynamic leveling system across open world. Your level gets scaled down to the level of the zone you're in so you're not over leveled and killing everything in one hit. One of the effects of that system is that your stats go down along with your level. If you pay attention in open world you can actually see your health change when you go to an area that has a lower level than the area you came from.
---
Ahh okay, thanks
---
My sincere thanks, I bought my expansion with cash a few weeks back. But this means that my scrounger friends can finally join me :)

Game is kinda similar to STO in terms of content delivery - we're having expansions which beside providing own content are also acting like a season "pass" for episodic updates. There's a significant difference in business model here: base game is available as f2p but it comes with restrictions which are meant to protect those who bought game from scammers and currency sellers; free variant is still playable but restrictions were created in a way you'd soon or later consider getting full game. Purchasing full version (expansion) lifts off all these limitations and allows you to play as long you want. You need an expansion to play Living Story episodes but even if you don't own it, episodes are being "booked" or reserved if you prefer, for later use. 
---
GW2 also allows you to exchange earned in-game currency to cash-shop currency and I believe it's bit easier than exchanging Dilithium to Zen. Cash-shop aka Gem Store offers unique skins, toys, convenience items and character/account upgrades - there's no P2W in it.
---
Beside your own character, there are no additional character associated with your account you have control over (no companions or duty officers you can send on automatic missions like in STO or NWO); certain professions have control over minions but that's definitely something else.
---
Skills and additional traits are being unlocked in an unavoidable order and you don't have to worry if you won't have enough points to get some skill - at level 80, you'll most likely have everything for your character. Same goes for setting up traits "trees" - you can always tweak them as you like without any additional fees.
---
The only problem you may face is that once you go thru initial tutorial you may feel overwhelmed, thrown onto deep water but fear not (this night :v) - you can't screw up anything, neither you have to rush with anything.
---
Woot! Fixed

he must have hired some company to upvote for him
---
What do you mean? My gf just snatched the code and shes a new player
---
&gt; I've decided that there needs to be something done
---
And what have you done?
---
So no more hulk, just anger management
---
The real issue is the fact you need two dodges to avoid it completely.
---
Squash the cast time to 1s and its fine.
---
Still giving out codes.  They come with a level 80 boost and a bunch of dyes.
---
Only in the most limited of definitions.
---
You can legally "buy" gold, and then use that gold to buy most of your best in slot armor, but... there's really no point. The second best is just fine for 99% of the content, and it doesn't really take that long to get in game anyway.
---
Then there's stuff like Boosters but... you get so many of them through the gameplay that it's actually kind of absurd. I have a bank tab filled with literally hundreds upon hundreds and could never use them all.
---
And the same goes for a Level 80 boost. They technically sell it, but... why? You get 2 free with the expansions, and you *really* shouldn't use it as a new player anyway. And then by the time you're an experienced played who would be okay using it, you've got so many level up items through playing the game anyway that you could never use them all.
---
I could literally level up about 100 Alts right now with the stuff that just builds up from playing the game, but you can't even have that many characters on an account.
---
**tl;dr** There is pay to progress faster, but most of it falls under "But why though?"
---
at first I thought it was supposed to be a play on Path of Fire and Heart of Thorns to kind of merge the name... but it would have been Path of Thorns or Heart of Fire I guess :V
---
&gt; reduced points for joining late
---
what did i miss in pvp world ?
---
If I already made an account, am I still able to get a code, or am I SoL?
---
What other sites are available besides Metabattle for WvW and PvP builds? I only know of Snow Crows' site as an alternative for raids and fractals, and while I've been referencing MB heavily lately, it seems like sometimes things don't get updated very quickly or completely (even taking into account the fact that people still have to test builds and run numbers every balance patch).
---
