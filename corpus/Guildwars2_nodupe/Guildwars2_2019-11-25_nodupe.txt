So basically, what you are saying here with this post is "Most MMO players want the stuff they're used to, make GW3 and make it be a WoW clone". Honestly, and I'm probably not the only one in that regard, that would be more of a reason for me to -not- play GW3.
---

---
 I love the fact that there's no gear grind. It forces them to make encounters that have new and refreshing ideas to them.
---
This game has been around for 7 years already. The people who wanted a gear grind or a holy trinity left 6 years and 11 months ago, and just bringing that back for those people would give you 1 extra month of those people before they left again for the next WoW clone.
---
---
---
Nike said this during teatime: When you release all at once there will be only one big patch week. If you release everything seperated there will be several patch weeks. People propably like to spend gems during patch weeks because new content makes happy. More releases = more gem sales.
---
It is really difficult for me to consider new players but I always do my best to include them in my logic. From my perspective, I’m a veteran player and I haven’t had a reason to play in over a year. I stopped in to check out templates, which are cool, but I just used them for fashion wars in the end.
---
The same as every other time someone posts up a YouTube video:
---
Influencer pulls things out of butt to justify their dissatisfaction that has come from over-playing a game. OP uses their status as an influencer to Argument from Authority their own dissatisfaction from over-playing a game. Neither can grok that they've over-played a game and need to move on so they blame the devs, or the development cycle, or toxic players, or anything but the fact they've milked the experience dry. 
---
So it goes.
---
You're an easy buy... no offense.
---
An optional sub in this game should at the very least include every single Living World update if you don't already have it, remove it once the sub is done if you haven't officially purchased it or weren't online when it launched for free.
---
A stipend of gems every month based on the amount of the sub you're paying. Unlimited material storage. 2 extra bank tabs that are only active while you have a sub. You could even include character bag slots for ever single character that is only active while subbed.
---
Throw in maybe 5 BL keys a month if they keep BL chests with the same drop rates.
---
I just mine the salt in this subreddit and sell it on the world markets.
---
What is there to do after level 80 in solo play? Not into WvW or PvP (perhaps ever)
---
Yes, your "F" skills, i.e. your shroud skills, work with traits just like core necro and reaper shroud would. You can have access to transfusion on F4 at all times with scourge for example, rather than having to wait to enter shroud as reaper or core necro. I believe dhuumfire procs on all shroud skills (not just F1) for scourge, which is why they added the internal cool down, so juggling that is important to playing well on condi scourge (maybe that has changed tho?)
---
It should be noted that when you have no shades out, all shroud skills proc around you, but when you have any number of shades out, they proc around the shades and NOT you.
---
Not really, no. Both can be viewed as equally easy - just slightly different.
---
Honestly, I've been "public" puging it and I've failed gold only 1 time on release day. 
---
There shouldn't be anything too crazy for rewards considering the lack of challenge IMHO.
---
Sure! The more, the merrier :)
---
We could bargain a little bit but still, honestly, I'd get optional sub as long as it was meaningful. What I'm offered for gems is not meaningful. Skin for 2k gems? Haha. Yup, I went so far as to bought all the lws I missed because I enjoy the story and want to play it when I have time. I just don't see any reason to spend more money on gems. No quality of life improvements at all.
---
I just don't really understand why they lose this opportunity in the first place. All people I know who play ESO pay the optional subscription. All the people I know who play SWTOR pay it, too. I bet lots of people would pay it in GW2 if it brought QoL with it (now, it should not become p2w though as long as it is optional).
---
I think there should be a way for everyone to do an Internet wager.  
---
It being simply that after Icebrood Saga, there will be no more new content and GW2 will be in maintenance mode only.
---
All those who believe can wager real life money and all those who believe that to be false can wager money.  How strongly you feel backed up by how much money you are wagering (from $1 to $1000 US Currency).  
---
It would be very interesting to see how much everyone feels on that backed by real life money and not just words.
---
For all we know the Fraenir will turn out to be Aesgir.
---
I see the differences very clearly and I think you missed my point entirely. We don't view games in the same light at all. What I said was basically that everything Anet does for their open world sums up to a big nothing because they're afraid to put any real gameplay and weight behind their world.
---
Sure NPC's can run around, die and spam 1 in a chain of events that leads to a big boss but none of it is failable or leads to any negative repercussions beyond a waypoint becoming contested and vendors disabled.
---
Somehow GW2 touts the journey of your character as important, citing player agency at us but in the open world none of this exists at all. I've never once felt like my existence mattered in GW2's open world in my 13,000 hours of playing.
---
They're "reluctant" because NCSoft is reluctant. 
---
Jeez, so many years and people still don't know who holds the reins...
---
I've had to use this ability dozens of times already to open gateways through the map.
---
we need a leak
---
But there are a ton of people that just don't have that requirement. It may not work for you, but it clearly works for a lot of other people. I'm saying there are probably far more casuals than hard core players and as a result, this system is working for a decent percentage of the playerbase. I'm no slouch at gaming. I play just fine.  But I'm still fine with the lack of challenge. I play games to relax and have fun. If I wanted challenge I'd remarry my ex-wife.
---
Raven was prob my favorite part of the episode, I always liked the spirit but the things making me want to make a raven themed norn + Nevermore lol.
---
For those who played gw1, this does feel a bit like after eye of the north came out and we wondered the future of gw1
---
The latest update just showed the people that told themselves that: "Anet promised content would not suffer from the layoffs", was a cheap lie. Not only Fractals and Raid development got gutted, now the story followed on foot, while we still have the regular schedule of Gem Store releases.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If they dont want to make it look like they just want to squeeze as much money out everyone as they can for as little effort as possible, which is basically none right now, then they do a horrible job at it.
---
Yeowch. Dude has an ego, eh?
---
Honestly I wish they'd take a break from living world where they just add new maps and story, in favor of adding stuff to the game that they never got around to.
---
The game needs more of the long desired activities like tavern fights, polymock, there was supposed to be a travelling carnival at one point iirc...
---
I still remember the rings on the beach in old LA that everyone assumed would eventually be used for some sort of mini-pet fighting arena.
---
I said something similar to this previously and was downvoted.
---
At this point tl'dr is just asking for a summary.
---
[deleted]
---
I hope when the end comes, it's after they had a chance to tell the story at an appropriate pace. Nothing would be worse than them trying to finish up the elder dragon saga in like 4 episodes or something. (Or worse, finish the game mid-story)
---
Yes
---
I dunno. Seems like a lot of effort.
---
Lots. Check out my guide at bit.ly/guidegw2 and head to the section titled I'm level 80, now what?
---
Or how many man hours are spent on items with a 0.000001% drop rate that 2 or 3 players across the entire game will ever get.
---
They are ok when they don't have to be repeated to unlock the vendor fresh every day.
---
With Icebrood five good people can literally just stand there and roll their face on the keyboard and get gold, I'd argue mechanics inherently make the Bjora strike more difficult
---
This is probably similar to how I feel. 
---
The way I think about it for me, is that the spell has been broken. 
---
Basically since launch, I've been under a GW2 spell, and I've loved it. My first year in the game, exploring on my first character, finding all of the little bits and pieces that made the game feel alive and lived in, gave rise to some the strongest and happiest memories I have in gaming. 
---
But now, I look at where the game is and where it is going, and I've come to realise, the devs don't care about me. They aren't making content for me anymore. I look at what the future of GW2 holds, and I just think it's all not for me at all, and leaves me so very underwhelmed. 
---
And thus the spell was broken. 
---
I'm now no longer captivated. I've moved on to other games. Where previously I used to at least diligently log on to both my accounts and do daily, no matter how annoying the individual items might be, I now log in to collect login rewards then log out. Although to be honest, some days in the last few weeks I've not even bothered to do that.
---
I think with the concern rippling through the community that the game may be closer to the end than the beginning, it would benefit them, at least for now, if they came out and addressed this. I don't realistically expect a day by day report, but maybe once a month or every other month come out with something like, "We're looking at game balance / working on new fractals / tweaking world bosses / plotting out the epic story".
---
Something would be better than nothing at this point, even if it's something vague.
---
I think this is a garbage mechanic and one not thought out very well by GW2 devs.
---
I bought begrudgingly bought PoF after being disappointed with HoT. After PoF, I decided that I wasn't going to buy another expansion. I could buy completed games for the amount of money they're charging.
---
Nike's and Inks' predictions for the future of gw2 weren't much less grimmer than Deroir's. Not to mention that Inks predicted an underwater expasion which ain't realistic at all.
---
As long as it runs Vulkan so anyone can play, I'd be open to that. 
---
(Considering I play on linux)
---
[removed]
---
Aaaaah, both. Gotcha.
---
I don't think he's entirely right or wrong.  MO and the people that went with him wouldn't have left Anet if they were planning on a new game.  That's obviously speculation but also could mean Anet is working on GW3 too.  GW3 or more GW2 would probably make me want to leave a company too after so long.  A new game wouldn't though.
---
If you ask me, they've been in maintenance mode and milking people since right after PoF.  The final straw for WvW and PvP will be when the restructure and swiss go live.  Those will basically automate the modes for the rest of the game's life.  PvE can really stop at any point.  They could push out an update late winter or early spring next year, we kill Jormag, and that's it.  Since we have zero communication from the company, there's nothing to be excited about so people fear for the worst but hope for the best.
---
I saw a large improvement, especially in large groups.
---
What's extremely disappointing is that ANet can't do this work in the engine/game, but some community driven "mod" can.
---
Also Zenimax has a nice roadmap to improving performance in ESO via updates to the engine/game.
---
Or maybe this is symbolizing that your character just reached 20 stacks of freeze and is now turning into an ice block. A mechanic that should result in death but you can just break yourself out of the ice block by mashing 1.
---
For supports you should turn on the boon table as well and look up the uptime of the important boons.
---
Imho, they don't really need to invest much more to make it truly shine. Tweak rewards, more events, less reliance on gem store for game engagement(etc mf booster/friend tp/bank tabs) and make custom maps for farming/rp/anything really. Even path of exile is more lenient than this garbage 0.000000000000001% rare loot chance we have here.
---
Yes they are your shroud skills but scourge only gets the entering, leaving, or in shroud traits on the F5. Other traits that specify shroud skill numbers will work on your shades but you aren't really in "Shroud"
---
I did all 4 earlier and was proud to have the mall done, until I logged in at reset and saw they were undone. Did I lose my acheivement points too?
---
I am afraid you missed the point there.
---
Those gateways are artificially created to be opened by a mastery which you instantly get without even levelling the mastery from first instance of the story. Meaning its not a key if everyone has it.
---
There is no difference to have or not have those gateways, since literally everyone who has stepped into the map can open them.
---

Sad, but true LOL. Very lore friendly, though. The exalted are worthless, so their assistance makes sense to be worthless.
---
They're like Olivia from Popeye. Totally useless people you help for god knows what reason.
---
Probably a dumb question, what are some ways to decrease ping/ms? I'm on a constant 300 to 350 and although it's not too bad in-game, it'd still be awesome to have less than that. I'm assuming there is no way since I live all the way in New Zealand which is basically far from every single server.
---
Why is there no Australasian server? Surely there has to be even just one that doesn't need to be all that big anyway.
---
Edit: Actually no, it's bad enough for me to not be able to outplay anything higher than level 60 without needing to take WAY more damage than needed. I'm stuck between wanting to play a more mechanically intensive class for the mechanical fun but also not being able to due to high ping but the safe classes are too boring to play. Oh man I feel like crying, it's literally like I've finally found the most perfect game for me yet I'm limited due to where I live.
---
I wish I was this naive in life. I miss the good old days of being 10 and believing the world to be a good place.
---
Now I'm 30 and everything went to hell.
---
Sodium
---
Point taken.
---
even though HoT had a lot of issues, the replayability was there and it kept it alive. the metas were fun and profitable (and still are) and it kept players playing. i also much prefer the jungle aesthetic to the desert.
---
Rent-free.
---
I don't remember saying underwater (not in any serious tone) but it's just a prediction, I don't see an underwater expansion (which I agree is very unlikely to happen) as grim though, 
---
I think the next expansion if there is one is us going to cantha, whatever that entails.
---
hey chin up mate
---
you're still finding the time to shitpost on the internet so it can't be all that bad
---
[Here is a good video on the PvE endgame](https://youtu.be/SsZApZ-JV-o). Mainly open world metas, fractals, raids, dungeons, and now strike missions on top of normal goals and gameplay of story, exploration, achievements, skins, etc.

While I can't point to a specific source that says "this is her", I have played hundreds of hours of Mass Effect. When Gunnery Chief Ashley Williams of the Eden Prime 212 calls me Commander, I recognize it.
---
That would definitely clean up the clutter a fair bit.
---
My heart can’t take getting Mass Effect Andromeda’d again.
---
Unfortunately not a lot of options. A VPN can *sometimes* route your connection better and you'll see a *minor* decrease but really you're stuck with ~300. You could try an account on EU (I assume you're on NA now) to see if that's any better for you but I do have a lot of friends in Aus/New Zealand that play just fine with the higher ping.
---

---
I've played since launch and I only log on gw2 during the holiday months. 7 level 80 toons, map completion, 5000 achievement points. 
---
When I first started this game, the story was kinda the bulk of the game for me. In fact it actually took me over a year to get level 80 because I just fell in love with the scenery, art, vistas, the flexible class system, and just the random encounters. I didn't even worry about map completion at this point. I just liked playing because it was the best mmo (and in my opinion still is) where you could get all the content, after one time payment.
---
Now I feel like there is more content than I can handle. I just recently got all the mounts except the warclaw, and finished all of the living story. (Except a couple episodes from season 2) the fact that people are getting mad because of lack of content, and hardcores getting mad at casuals for not playing, is bullshit. Anet has put A LOT of work into this game, and in my opinion, I wouldn't care if they ended the living story this season. This now free to play game is revolutionary in comparison to most MMOs out there. I mean, how many MMOs have you seen where questing isn't just a fetch this and bring it back, or where you can face other servers in all out siege war?? Not to mention, all content in the game is pretty much aquireable unless it was during a special event. That gold to gem transfer? Sure it may rip you off a bit, but at least it's a function In the game. Yeah I don't really think they need to charge for additional build Slots and whatnot, but to think that you can get those through a gold transfer really changes the perspective. Let's just quit it with the immediate gratification, and just enjoy the masterpiece we have
---
I see. I will need to try that.
---
I’d love to believe that’s the case, I really would. But lack of communication has been noted time and time again. It just seems like were in the home stretch, and even that isn’t critical enough for them to speak up.
---
Oof this is me as well. Played since beta weekend with around 5.5k hours logged. You hit the nail on the head. 
---
I still log in to progress the story when new content drops, which I'm sure is how ANET wants it, but the spell is broken and I never buy anything anymore. I use to buy stuff all the time. Don't tell my wife. But not anymore. 
---
I'll log in every third Friday or so, to play WvW Friday night reset with the guildies, but the spell is broken. 
---
It feels as though a big black gloomy cloud looms over Tyria nowadays. It's all I can see. It's all I can feel. And that cloud is the Gem Store. 
---
I've recently gone back to playing GW1. Man, the story in that game is *so* *good.*
---
That's really not a bad idea.
---
Bicarbonate
---
It might be possible that they are able to overstaff more than other MMOs because they aren't paying people as much as other MMOs studios
---
But also the numbers I've seen that show ANET has a huge staff have been a bit sketchy, and don't seem to actually break down how many developers they have compared to other studios. Just because there a ton of employees out there doesn't mean those people are actually developing the software.
---
1. Anywhere between a fortnight or a month or two depending upon you just doing maps and hearts, or if you craft alongside it, or if you run into a lot of event chains, or if you use XP boosts, or, or, or...
---
2. There is a lot of stuff that needs a good group but all of it is optional to the story.
---
3. Me too, but dodging at the right time is the core of the game's combat. There are builds with a lot of sustain that can absorb the damage from you screwing up a dodge. But trying to make a traditional MMO tank is pointless. Everything at lvl80 usually hits like a tonne of bricks so clamming up is just delaying the inevitable.
---
No, wiki just has lots of posts with minimum graphic setting screenshots
---
not really, vague doesnt do it anymore. people want to see whats coming and when its coming, otherwise its as if nothing is coming
---
not that I'm aware of
---
Your numbers are way off. That's base pay. You're not taking pension and other extras into account. Employees typically cost 1.5 times their base salary.
---
wvw alliances
---
If you are a casual player at the beginning of the game the game will have months of solo / open world content for you to play. If I were you I would face the problem you have with dodging people will recommend you to play a build wich will have such a high survivability that you don't need to dodge and can facetank anything. Don't do that for your own sake it will make the game dull and leave you unable to play endgame pve content if you will ever want to do that. My recommendation would be to play a staff Daredevil because it is easy and you are usefull. You play it by pressing effectively 5 buttons: 1,2, 2 of your utilities and the Dodge. So you dodge all the time with it. Treat the dodge as a weaponskill that happens to evade. You can take a trait that heals you more the more damage you do, so you will have a high survivability as well.
---
i was like yes i finally leveled a mastery. lets try opening a chest.  then i get some random jewel shard -.-
---
Somehow the original anet devs were designer gods. I'm serious it's incredible how fast and structured they released everything. That game never slowed down until new anet abandoned it for (imo) a trash sequel. How many years have gone by and still no new dungeons, very few raid zones, and no new pvp modes. Gw1 produced  these like they were going out of style and they (pve)were legitimately hard as fuck on hard mode.
---
It's been like 8 years and we've hardly scratched any of the areas we could visit in gw1 in much less time. It was a huge mistake not having every campaign zones available in gw2 on launch. How can you have guild wars without all of that and re release it like it's new content. No originality on gw2 and I already know all the lore except for the stupid boring dragons.
---
They even ruined the gods and made 1 of them evil like wtf. Who writes this trash. Why do still have the option to even select Balthazar as your god in human char creation
---
I could go on for ages there's so much wrong in the game
---
Saga -&gt; Expansion -&gt; LW6 -&gt; Maintenance mode
---
The Commander only accepts dollar bills in the jar at the front of the stage.
---
Might they be working on Guild Wars 3 already, but they can't talk about it yet?
---
I think it might only bug out if you discover the town before the story, specifically. I also used a TP-to-friend to enter the map initially, but I was only coming for the Strike mission with friends, so all that I actually uncovered was the cave with the Strike portal, before WPing out of the map to raid. Later that night I did the story and got the Icebound achievement normally.
---
This is me too. I used to be very hardcore, to the point of making a legendary every two months without using real life cash. 
---
So I was playing the latest episode on my legendaries decked asura, which I used to be so proud of, but now I’m like so what? What’s the point? Build template have a lot to do with this feeling, plus the nerfing of Scourge in PVE and making chrono not being able to shatter without clones. Why mess with core spec mechanics like that man?
---
Xiuquatl was the latest legendary I made. I was gonna make Shining Blade but now meh. Legendaries have lost that special spark for me. 
---
I just finished the latest episode, spread over 5 days after it was released. Goes to show how much I don’t play GW2 anymore. Nothing to shout for too. I wish Anet would return to LS2 style, reuse the maps but give truly fleshed out stories instead of constantly wasting talents creating disposable maps.
---
Why is this NSFW
---
Just finished the skyscale and I am wondering how it compares to the collection needed to build a legendary. I have not made any yet and want to know what I would be in for.
---
What new engine would actually change in this game? Does it really matter?
---
They are pretty badass though, bjora it's the only place i get downed, i would totally make a marauder set to play there, but i'm already using all my templates and i'm not swapping by hand... Also all i need is 8 more metas and theres literally 0 reason to me to go there ever again...
---
The game is a dead mess with no future, run, don't walk away from anything anet touches.
---
Is that 300 post layoffs from earlier this year?
---
&gt; They have more staff than almost any other MMO
---
Interesting. Do you have source for that? All I found was pretty much very outdated or not info at all regarding other MMO.
---
Well i will finish the achivements, then i will make the strike mission every day together with raven thingy, allthough that one is pretty boring but a lot of loot for 5 min of my life so when ever. After that i have other maps or things that i do daily and then 4-7 hours in WvW. 
---
I am not sure why you feel that one map should cover your daily GW2 for a few months? Also the map is just a part of one large map that they will expand on. Something people here on reddit asked for because they enjoyed when they did it in Dry Top and they feel there are too many maps out there. They got what they wanted so Anet tried again to deliver what asked for and yet they get shit for that as well. Seem to be damned if you do and damned if you don't...
---
Right! Have set up a post there too. Thanks for the idea, I tend to forget about the forum due to reddit basically being the omni-forum of the internet.
---
A few things: 
---
1- dodging in this game is really easy. Like *really* easy.
---
2- you can always play a thief. Many people will say necro, but a thief is not only immortal in combat (sword/pistol thief can permastun/aoe blind by mashing 3 and 5, and can fallback into dual pistols. It has also permastealth if you want, and leeches 30% of it's damage. Once you upgrade to daredevil you are permadodging so you don't need to time anyway.
---
You can grind to level 80 in a few hours with just spamming 1 or 2
---
sad part is,that even gem store have mostly trash items. they could MILK us so much more.
---
Bitterfrost mobs uses quite interesting AI system, sometimes it backfires to them (like wolfs rotating on one place, because of low health and movement modifiers that confuses them).
---
While I like innovations, I bet lots of players just avoid oneshot monsters like a plague. (did I mentioned that BF brutes can bait your reflects to not oneshot themselfs? quite impressive).
---
Still, Boneskinner should be more dangerous IF its upscaled by 10+ players. His skillset feels very limited.
---
My advice would be to add a group to the lfg tool. For some reason in this game there are a lot more people sitting and waiting for others to put a group up instead of making their own group and add it. 
---
Strike mission groups usually fills up within a few min if that, so don't fear doing that, it will be the fastest way :)
---
I think they will try to release anything after expansion to get as much money as they can. To keep illusion that everything is fine. But of course meantime after expansion release their gw2 team will be very reduced to just a few people. And then they will release LW6 which will be very slow developed and with small amount of content. They will release it from time to time without officially announcing maintenance mode too fast. To make as much money they can. And then it will be clear for everyone that the game is in maintenance mode.
---
No it is not okay since this is falls under RMT, a transaction made with out-of-game items/currency for in-game items/currency is against the rules.
---
and you shall not make SWIMSUITS and than leave it for NPCs. I have spoken.
---
I suspect it's because we only got half of the intended map in the release. The reward in here will coordinate with the rest of the story that is aligned to the rest of the map. Give it some time.
---
Is GW1 populated at all these days? I mean can you get groups for DOA and Endgame stuff or do u have to rely on heros?
---
On not even bothering with the last 2 dragons! :(
---
Noone can stop you. There's no way they can figure out why you gave gold to someone
---
This is no secret.
---
NCSoft had to come in and lay off a fuck ton of them because none of them were doing their job and instead were pursuing side projects.
---
&gt; The point of this mastery is to explicitly show every (possibly new) player what masteries are
---
Except you need PoF to get this mastery, which is *bundled with HoT*, two expansions that specifically use Masteries lol
---
Oh certainly.  There's a ton of overhead for a company.  But considering just the individuals involved and nothing else, this is the bare minimum for an expansion.  We're not talking about things like *average* salaries, seniority, or the additional middle management that would be involved either.  There's an entire lore department, a team lead, concept artists (who may or may not be in the texture artist position(s)), a QA team (which I did mention), community managers...  There's a lot of people involved, even more than I've listed.  $400k would definitely not cover it.
---
You say you tried Ele and died a lot...that's a thing yes but Ele and then Weaver is very versatile. You want to go for a sustain build, so sword dagger and then trait water and maybe earth. Use food to buff vitality and toughness...it's not expensive. Once you start surviving long enough to get a feel for rotations you'll start melting mobs. Staff is for group content...don't run around solo with a staff.
---
No next week the strike mission will rotate to the next boss.
---
Ya, i noticed the wonky AI, with the Brutes no less, they tend to just...run away like they are feared, its a bit odd
---
Can you explain a bit more please about what you mean when you say that restructuring and swiss go live will result in automation?
---
Very likely not.  Seniority with the company would have them in the $60-70k range.  But this is minimums, as I said.
---
But upgrading to DX12 isn't as simple as "I put in new code, we're done!" and everything looks better.  The assets all need to be redone to make use of the new engine.  Sure the geometry could probably remain the same in most cases, but texturing and lighting would have to be redone entirely, new normal maps, the particle system would likely change entirely to coordinate with the lighting engine so that all changes, hair and clothing systems will work differently so *everything* with hair and floppy parts (capes, and stuff...  Get your minds out of the gutter) is going to need a pass to make sure it doesn't clip into itself.
---
If this even was remotely true I'd be somewhat satisfied. Sad but satisfied. But somehow I think Maintenance mode is coming after saga
---
Have you tried necro minion mancer and then level into scourge minion mancerwhen you have the skill points? They're definitely survivable in PvE and can be a little flexible. Especially when you get to scourge and gain barrier.
---
And I'm pretty sure Star Wars ripped off Westerns. 
---
How stupid are these post going to get? 
---
GW2 caused cancer?  Aids? Hitler? The Big Bang?
---
No, people stuck in time just like the maps.
---
Sure thing.
---
Based on what we know about the system right now, Anet needs to manually kind of keep track and adjust things on their end to ensure good match-ups with players.  With restructuring WvW match-ups, it'll allow the system to do it automatically each week with little to no work really required from Anet.  They will obviously have to keep an eye on it as you do with any live service but not to the extent now.  Its a win for players and the company.  As for swiss, it should create much better match-ups for them as well.  It might not be more automated but the swiss style system should definitely create more even fights for players.  As for the botting problem, I'm not sure but that is a completely different subject.

---
&gt; Those gateways are artificially created to be opened by a mastery which you instantly get without even levelling the mastery from first instance of the story. Meaning its not a key if everyone has it.
---
But, even if you *have* the key, you have to *use* it. It's like you're arguing that a door does not exist if it is not locked, which is just a recipe for a lot of headaches. The point of the Raven locks is not that you cannot open them, it's that they are not open *by default,* and players must engage with them to open them.
---
I think he means trading in game gold for a product out side the game, with someone in game.
---
i.e I'll give you this item and you trade me gold in game - Obviously not allowed.
---
If however he were to sell his gear, on say Ebay or whatever, to some random person / stranger (not a player in game), for cash, then use the cash to go on the Anet gemstore and buy gems then convert to gold, that's OK isn't it? 
---
It's his money.
---
Otherwise, what we can't use our real life money, that we get through selling junk on Ebay  (or whatever your local auction site is) for gemstore purchases? What we do with our money, and where that cash came from, isn't Anet's business.
---
To get you to come back and hopefully spend money.
---
Thanks, I did want some dialogue. Your post can be summed up as *corporations always have to keep growing* -I agree with that. But ANET has only 2 products and growth doesn't mean they should improve GW2. 
---
Then again, not every company has to be successful. Thankfully we don't live in that kind of a boring fairytale. 
---
Anyways, not trying to be rude, but here's actual business 101: [The BCG Matrix](http://netmba.com/strategy/matrix/bcg/) It may be an outdated tool, but man does it fit the MMORPG market so well. 
---
On the BCG matrix, GW2 would be a cash cow and GW1 a dog at this point in time.
---
 
---
"Cash cows - As leaders in a mature market, cash cows exhibit a return on assets that is greater than the market growth rate, and thus generate more cash than they consume. **Such business units should be "milked", extracting the profits and investing as little cash as possible**. Cash cows **provide the cash required** to turn question marks into market leaders, to **cover the administrative costs of the company**, to **fund research and development**, to service the corporate debt, and to pay dividends to shareholders. Because the cash cow generates a relatively stable cash flow, its value can be determined with reasonable accuracy by calculating the present value of its cash stream using a discounted cash flow analysis."
---
Read that again if you have to, it perfectly describes GW2. For past few years, under MO's leadership, ANET tried developing other projects but failed for whatever reasons. Then NCSoft, which have shareholders, stepped in. And this is where we are at. They desperately need more games and they are probably developing something... at least should be. 
---
So what's next? How long until GW2 slides into the dog category? Can ANET put out some new products that can create actual growth? 
---
You don't have to answer these questions, it's just something to think about. 
---
Last note: while writing this, my mind is blown... MMORPG genre itself has been in a cash cow phase for the last -who knows how many- years. The milking is real and innovation is no where to be found. I wonder about the future of MMOs and what will replace them.
---
Chrisbtacos: I did try the necro but not beyond 20 or so. I didn't utilize shroud whatsoever. My son recommended I avoid Necro until I get more comfortable playing with the F keys.  I switched to console games for almost a decade and only just came back to computer games. Some of the dex skills are a wee bit not there quite yet. .LOL
---
Straiven\_Tienshan: I did in fact run around with a staff all by my lonesome and died willy nilly. I shall go try the sword dagger thingy. Thank you! I shall see if I live. :D lolololol

https://kotaku.com/guild-wars-2-developer-arenanet-plans-for-mass-layoffs-1832799804
---
My argument wasn't even casual vs hardcore. Literally just making a somewhat effective build with offensive stats makes you incredibly OP for any of open world/story. That's not hardcore at all. Why is putting any tiny amount of effort into a game considered hardcore?
---
It's not so black and white lol.
---
Relaxing and challenge in video games aren't mutually exclusive. At all. Would you say the same about chess? It may require you to think a little but it's still a very relaxing game.
---
I really don't agree with this mindset. You say relax but what you really mean is be lazy and refuse to learn/be effective at the combat. And that's it, just the combat. You can grind collections and meta events all day but as soon as you have to time a dodge or alter your build it's hardcore? It's almost like pressing more than one button at a time and keeping an eye on what your enemy is doing is stressful to people like you - how is this so?
---
Regardless, do you really think this system is working well at this point? I've got two extremely casual guilds both with 300+ members and almost nobody in them is happy with the last few episodes and that's not even counting all of the outcry we've had on nearly every discussion platform for the game, journalists included. I honestly think you're lying to yourself and/or living in a strange little bubble when you say that the majority of the playerbase is happy with what Anet is doing. Much like all the people that cry "dead game" and bash Anet all day, it seems like you live in an echo chamber and refuse to accept the bigger picture.
---
I wouldn't do it.
---
Why from reddit?
---
Even in open world PvE, you only got half of a map and half of a story episode. The PROLOGUE was way more substantial. The bar for what you all think is acceptable from ArenaNet is rapidly getting lower and lower.
---
More GW2 fan art I drew \^\^ I wanted to draw Jormag and my character so I concepted this potential meeting. I hope we actually get to talk to Jormag in the future episodes\~ :D

mike z is leaving?
---
Mana Works maybe? /ponder
---
I think they will just most of the assets created for the cancelled project with mana works under a new name and get the people into the new boat once it gets going
---
I saw him too, but he had dialogue. Couldn't record and didn't screenshot him in time.
---
I don't find chess a relaxing game. Not sure why you would. And yes, degrees of challenge automatically take away relaxing. Causing effort takes away relaxing. Maybe it's different if you're in your early 20s, but the age of the average gamer today is 35 and we all have different ideas of what's easy. There are some people who run around saying raids are easy. 
---
There are plenty of people who don't find the new zones easy. You do so you can't understand them. Doesn't change the fact that are most likely more of them than you think there are.
---
GW2 is silent, but deadly. It has barely any social media presence, and yet still makes more than most MMOs that are not built on massive IP franchises. Its continued success *infuriates* those who want the game to be something else entirely.
---
The moment they announce that GW2 development is ending the cash shop purchases stop. No reason to deprive themselves of a year or two of sales
---
Could somebody TLDR this or give a brief summary please for those of us who are at work and can’t watch it atm? thanks!
---
I and others have traded gold for character art commissions. This is not the same but pretty much the same. I think i put something about its purpose in the note in case the mail was flagged. No issues.
---
Do you? When I break out stacks just reset and start anew. No damage procs for me, I was unpleasantly surprised.
---
Between this and Mantras having to be re-cast every time you switch loadouts, I'm going to keep delaying getting into Firebrand.
---
Ahh I see. Yeah I agree with that completely, things have been looking this way for a year now. Thanks for the help!
---
What’s a boomer
---
Eh, I don't see maintenance mode coming, but this level of development being consistent for awhile. Also if there was something like a Gw3 in development, there's no way it would have *just* now started. If Derior is right, then I would predict that a new game would have been development at around the start of LS4. Why else did we not get an xpac?
---
Don’t do that. Don’t give me hope.
---
this blew my mind, i knew there was something about her voice!
---
The old, simple days, eh?

Looks like the currency already exists in the game
---
&gt;  so if such has occurred, then it "hasn't lasted". 
---
Your mistake is that you're assuming the complaints on that subreddit are the same as the ones here, they aren't.
---
The community there **knows for a fact** that the devs (including the lead designer) will read their posts. So they never feel the need to spam the subreddit with it, nor do they feel the need to be rude or hateful.... If a patch is "bad" there's usually only a single post regarding it, which gets stickied to the top, and everyone else goes on with enjoying the game because they have an extreme amount of **trust** in the devs.
---
The devs usually respond to that post within a day, and begin asking for feedback, and those feedback changes get implemented within the week.
---
I'v personally never seen another large company for a game with this many players act as swiftly and efficiently as GGG does. It's fascinating to watch tbh.... And since GGG has been doing this so consistently, the playerbase largely never feels the need to go crazy over things or panic. They know they're in good hands, even when a certain patch or mechanic isn't quite living up to their expectations, they know changes will be made soon.
---
The same can't be said for Anet.
---
&gt; If memes are enough to placate people, 
---
1. The community there never needs to be "placated" in the first place. They're never hostile or angry. They get a HUGE amount of content drops, at an extremely short amount of time. Generally speaking 99% of them (including the subreddit) are satisfied every patch. The complaints/crises are typically nitpicking regarding certain **mechanics** rather than the patch as a whole... GGG has been so consistent at releasing quality content that ultimately the players have become spoilt with it, so they nitpick smaller stuff rather than the larger ones... But it's usually done in a respectful manner.
---
2. The memes aren't posted **during** the complaint periods obviously. But as i said, those periods never last more than a day, because the devs are quick to respond.
---
Something to help with dodging: get a mouse with side buttons(doesn't have to be an mmo mouse) and bind dodge to one of them. It'll be much easier for you to get your muscle memory to do 'danger=thumb press button' than the default dodge button.  
---
The game's combat is very active. As people said you probably can get by without dodging in core maps. But anything beyond that(even dungeons) you will need to actively avoid damage. The alternatives to dodging are a lot more complicated and require faster reactions - repositioning skills, blocks, aegises.
---
I am at 977/1000 ap progress on "Sons of Svanir slayer" which I intended to finish in Bjora. BUT apparently no mobs there count for that achievement (not even a mob literally named "Son of Svanir"). So I guess you're comparing different mobs /s
---
This.
---
Once is fine and it adds more to do on the map.  Repeatable however is massively annoying.
---
The little things that gets people excited.
---
&gt; What? You understand what a dictionary is right? Doesn't matter how you personally decide to use a word, it has a set definition and use. Dictionary just points that out.
---
So you understand my point about "When you have to go to dictionary definition to try and win on semantics, there's probably something wrong with the merits of your argument."
---
&gt;Interview right before prologue: 'Things we're not talking about today, elite specialisations.' They can't suddenly pull those out of their ass.
---
**Things we're not talking about today.** 
---
That does *not* mean "things that won't be coming out at some point."
---
That does *not* mean "things we're not developing internally."
---
That does *not* mean "it won't be out in three months from now." 
---
All it means is they were not talking about it *in that interview,* which is entirely consistent with their communication policy regarding anything more than one patch away. 
---
Read the entire paragraph there:
---
**"Things that we wouldn’t rule out** – but that we’re not talking about today – *would be like another mount, another elite specialisation,* **those types of things.* Those are all things that *traditionally have waited until a boxed product* is ready. **But instead,** now we’re saying, ‘look, here are the things that we’re doing. *Here’s what we’re releasing right now.* **Here’s what’s next.’ "**
---
I don't know how much "reading around the lines" one would have to do to completely miss the point of that paragraph, but because you apparently did miss it, the point was "we are doing these things, or at least things equivalent to these things, but we are not tying them to a single boxed release, we will be putting them out when we feel like it, and we won't be talking about them until we do."
---
&gt;Same interview says they don't forget about real raids,
---
It actually says "we can’t forget about the raid players. Also, they won’t let us forget that they exist! " But within the context of Strike Missions, so that's not actually confirming more raid development, but could instead be referring to trying to make non-raid content that raid players would enjoy. It's not any sort of confirmation that there *won't* be future raids, it's just not confirmation that there *will* be either. 
---
&gt;Dig around a bit and you'll be surprised.
---
Doubtful, but again, if you can back your claims up with a source, I'm listening.
---
You'll notice that in every map with water where you can swim (and not just walk in it) the water level is the same everywhere.
---
That is because under every map there is water. At the same layer everywhere. Map with no water are just built above it. When you go under that layer, the gravity is turned off and you switch to underwater combat, etc.
---
 That means that they cannot make maps with water on different layers. That limits what they can do.
---
That is a relic of the gw1 engine and they never upgrade it to be able to have water on different heights.
---
Oof, good point. Kinda contradicts the event then. Maybe the aberrants are split souls given bodies? Or that's just the lore for the aberrant haunts.
---
Makes a bit of sense, as those three Bitterfrost foes fucking hit like a truck. There's a **lot** more of these foes in the new map, so seems reasonable to downtune them.
---
We don't even know what is "the table" and if this "table" even exist...
---
Guardian/mesmers elite specs have a ton of blokes and aegis that can help you to avoid having to evade.
---
Yes?
---
Those three mobs in Bitterfrost are a bit overtuned, even by HoT standards. There's easy counters to all HoT powerhouses (like just *strafing* for the snipers). But there was definitely a decrease in difficulty since PoF - not just S4.
---
I hope for some Jotun lore, but so far that are absent from the story. 
---
Also, I am really torn because of what Jormag say.
---
All that stuff she say about something that's coming and darkness and whatnot tries to force me into trusting her.
---
On the other hand, nobody who is in danger (you might be a dragon but we killed 3 so far) should use "trust" and "something is coming" arguments but real facts. Jormy, wanna help us? Speak up! 
---
I want to believe that some good plot twist is coming after all.
---
Of course its popular because the devs never have to go back and fix mistakes. For that reason amongst others its a poor design philosophy.
---
Depending on if the map actually expands.. might have to update this trail later on.
---
&gt; You can love the fact that there's no gear grind. I'm sure that's true for a lot of the population of the game currently. I'm also pretty sure that not having it is one of the reasons GW2 fell so hard post-launch. I mean, the game had over a million users requesting access to the beta, and they sure as hell didn't come from GW1. Then they get to the game, see that gearing is basically nonexistent and they have nothing meaningful to work towards, and leave. 6 months and 11 months ago, as you say.
---
This happens to basically every MMO, though. (And to some extend, other gametypes) There simply is a sizable amount of "MMO hoppers" that will join a new MMO for a few week/months, then hop over to the next one. It doesn't really matter what type of gameplay systems they have or have not, those people will be done with the game soon after release.
---
Calling GW2 a failed experiment is also underselling how many good systems they combined that are becoming more and more standard in other games. Having things like instanced loot per character, gathering nodes that are personal and generally all other systems that make actually meeting and finding other players in the world not a pain, and naturally stimulates cooperation. Many other games when GW2 came out had the situation where you hated seeing other people as they would be killing your 4/10 boars, and if someone attacked those enemies you wanted to kill first then tough luck, the KS system kicked in and you could not longer hurt them, or wouldn't get any loot.
---
It wasn't until after gw2's release that alot of these other games have slowly introduced more of these systems and for that alone I'd say there's nothing failed about it(Aside from the fact that, you know, the game is still running after 7 years. Many actual failed MMOs didnt last that long.)
---
Yep, that is highly possible:-P
---
[We already have them.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Path_of_Fire_mastery_tracks)
---
I wouldn't be surprised. GW2 is their worst performing game other than AION.  Also if you add up all the revenue their MMOs make it equals half of what the mobile games do. 
---
So it's definitely plausible that NCsoft drops GW2.
---
This is Anet we are talking about. "Why do that when you can put it in the gemstore?"
---
I tried it too, but my bombs got stuck in the air.
---
Ahem, this is nostalgia, gw1 maps were empty as fuck and hard mode wasn't that hard, just tedious when you had to find that last group of mobs running in circle, don't get me wrong it was cool, but this is obvious to me they need more time to dev a gw2 map than a gw1 map, also we are boosted on steroid in gw2, we were wayyyyy slower in gw1 so even with maps 3xbigger in gw2 they seem bigger in gw1
---
da fuck? that shit was better than the entirety of PoF. and I do mean shit.
---
It contradicts the layoffs this year when NCSoft practically told Anet to get their shit together and focus on GW2
---
Around your character IF you don't have any shades places. Otherwise it works only around shades, not your character.
---
If you like slow and condi based characters with very low damage output (because you have to use your skill loop 3 times to reach numbers), that can also punish itself with blind, cripple, bleeding, torment or weakness — take it.
---
Try mudfish, that usually lowers it by heaps and is the cheapest
---
Yes, give it time. They changed their development and release cycle. The effect that will have on content frequency and quality will not be noticed from two releases. That's just fact. The previous 7 years don't change this.
---
Like it or not, Development is a subset of the sciences and there are certain realities that come with that:
---
1. About 1/3 (sometimes more) of my work is Research work. I.E. Non-functional. It doesn't add features, fix bugs, or rework anything, but just does some barebones PoC to see if something *might* be worth trying. *Then* it gets rolled into an upcoming sprint/dev cycle.
---
2. Of the remaining 2/3 of work I do, about 60% of it are bug fixes (most of which the customer never even knows about), 20% new features, and the remaining 20% more non-function changes preparing for future features, fixes, or products. That's 80% of work *not* on new features directly.
---
3. All of our work is decided at the beginning of our sprint. Only Escalations get added ad-hoc. That means if we find more work that needs to be done, it gets pushed back by \~2 weeks.
---
4. We make changes to our process on an as-needed basis, but with 2-week sprints, that means we usually don't really know if the change is working well for about 2 months.
---
5. There is a ton of data out there that shows that the "Live service model" gamers seem to hate so much is better for devs, reduces bugs, gets features/content out the door faster, makes it easier AND faster to resolve issues (meaning less downtime for users), etc. Ever wonder why GW2 has rarely had a true outage?
---
6. Finally, gamers/players seem to want several things that are inherently contradictory. They want the "Big" releases and fewer bugs. The problem is that has been *proven* to not work. Agile, DevOps, and Lean Programming all came out of the fact that "Waterfall" development (what we call the long dev to big release cycle) actually tends to lead to:
---
   1. Many many more bugs
---
   2. Less testing (not as much time for it/not baked into the dev process)
---
   3. Less security -  it's one of the last things done in Waterfall development and setbacks lead to it simply being pushed aside to meet deadlines.
---
   4. Siloed knowledge - with so much riding on deadlines, work has to be done fast and little time is given to share knowledge or document work leading to Silos of knowledge where specific devs have to solve specific issues. This usually ends of leading to burnout where said devs leave and now no-one knows the system
---
   5. Incredible amounts of Technical Debt. There will *always* be technical debt, but just like real debt, if it's never "paid down" then it will eventually start to eat at resources making it hard to continue adding features/content as the old cruft is so engrained at that point that it's damn near impossible to fix, work with, or workaround without potentially breaking entire parts of the system.
---
You don't have to like it or even agree with me. That said, I've shown my team members, other dev teams, admin teams, former colleagues the comments in this thread about the ANet devs and every time it ends up with people either facepalming or laughing at the absurdity and unrealistic expectations within this reddit community.
---
&gt; Last note: while writing this, my mind is blown... MMORPG genre itself  has been in a cash cow phase for the last -who knows how many- years.  The milking is real and innovation is no where to be found. I wonder  about the future of MMOs and what will replace them. 
---
A new brand of online gming - more session play, for example. It's been happening for a long time now
---
Huh? You are comparing FFXIV updates to GW2 updates?
---
____
---
You mean 2 months after their latest expansion, where they released a new dungeon, a new 8 man ultimate raid, new story updates, new 24 man alliance raid, new raid armor pieces, new outfits, new pvp armor, new extreme boss fight, new weapon collection from the boss, new mounts, new personal housing and decoration, new guild housing areas, new fellowship/friendship system to actually play as a group, and  new hunting quests among many other new features in the game.
---
And this is just a patch, I didn't even start talking about what their latest expansion Shadowbringers offered. 
---
___
---
And then GW2, where you got 30 minute story, weapon collection, and strike mission? 
---
Come on, dude. Guild Wars 2 is a great game, but please don't compare it to FFXIV because it shits on GW2. Just don't. Like FFXIV is so high up that you shouldn't even mention GW2 next to it. 
---
"Most player-friendly MMOs on the market" mhm sure.
---
When she said "Commander" I was like "Ashley,we are not on Normandy darling"
---
The commander wakes up from his slumber... stares at a wallpaper hanging besides his laptop. Wait...*laptop*...? Groaned audibly, the commander muttered to himself, "man... what time is it.." Glances around the room, he found a clock. "7am.. time for work. That was one long dream..."  
---
Whoa whoa, calm down satan.
---
If you don't seee fighting a strike fun, then don't do it. If you see it to be fun, then don't bother to think about rewards - do it for that fun.
---
How did you do that? Flamethrower + Skyscale tonic would be my new game xD
---
Who doesn’t shatter their clones?
---
Yeah HoT mobs were pretty great design. PoF definitelys started the decline indeed.
---
I'm hoping for Primordus to make an appearance again before it's too late.
---
I've been watching them and seeing something wholly different, from the ending of the last living season into the dragon bash and the world evolving. It seems to me that new content is dropping at a bit of a faster clip than it used to, but I might also just be getting older. Each festival has a bit of new story to it, right?
---
So, I have to wonder if they're moving into a constant production cycle with their story content, where they're going to attempt really rapid, consistent updates in the same vein as the current living story. They've waffled around with mount skins for long enough, I personally hope that the next gem store item is going to be last week's living story episode because this week's dropped so quickly.
---
Picture that, 10-20 new hours of gameplay each month (or a returning festival/returning event) so that the game world is always in flux. I've got my fingers crossed that they get themselves kicked into high gear with new content releases.
---
you can only create so much content before it becomes repetitive in a game without content releases.  
---
the only thing that is left is to discuss how it could be and meming arround. memeing is basically the only way to cope with their feelings and to get something to laught out of it. everything else simply looks grim and dark to them in terms of gw2.
---
It's an attempt at avoiding aoes from what I remember
---
Why? GW1 maintenance mode great content added.
---
Not gonna lie, it looks pretty cool under the beetle.
---
Oh come on now buddy. There's plenty of people in arenanet with passion. This is NCsoft's doing.
---
I think HoT/S3 enemy difficulty is great for "high end" foes, the issue with them was that the spike in difficulty from S2 was a bit high (and S2 foes even got a nerf during the wait between S2E8 and HoT, to make matters worse). I think if PoF and HoT's difficulties were swapped, then things would have been better received. Even then, since GW2 is a "game for casuals" (or so Anet seems to want), having such difficulty in the main story is a bit miffy.
---
I kind of wish that story instances all had challenge motes which upped the mob difficulty to on par to HoT/S3 mobs, with the PoF/S4 difficulty as the default.
---
- Don't underpay your engine developers so they leave and you're stuck with the most outdated, unoptimized engine in the MMO genre.
---
Same here. I already took a two-year break in 2014, when there was that massive content drought. Came back when WildStar (still the better game \*sigh\*) was dying and with the revamped fractals and raids, GW2 finally had content that was worth playing again. Now it's exactly as you described, "They aren't making content for me anymore.", so it's time for the next break. I wonder whether they'll make a comeback this time.
---
&gt; So I don’t think the no talk = no content work.
---
Here's the thing. We were pretty happy with the content we were getting back then. Putting out new maps was still a big deal because we had hardly had any new maps since the game released. We had some raids release, we had the best fractals they've ever made, complete with CMs AND reworks of existing fractals, and they actually kept to their release schedule better (once it started of course).
---
Also crucially... the leaks did actually happen. We knew an expansion was coming. We felt safe and secure about the future of the game. Now it's certainly true that not announcing the expansion prior to the end of the living story proceeding it is in line with their actions in the past. However, if they stick to that just because they have done it in the past, IMO they are being beyond stupid. People are worried and they need to be reassured. We don't need to know details about the expansion, there can still be a revelation about where we're going or whatever, but if there actually is an expansion they absolutely need to let people know because people are freaking out and they will give up or jump ship.
---
Best i can do Is 3.50
---
Neither. Those stat combinations are really inefficient.
---
Vigilant has so many problems. The main stats are Power and Toughness. But you never want to invest heavily into Power without Precision and Ferocity to back it up. You also never want to take a lot of Toughness without any Vitality, Toughness is the worse defensive stat already. Then you have minor stats Concentration and Expertise. You never want to take Expertise without Condition Damage, there's no point. The Concentration might be a little bit useful, but you could just take a far more effective set with Concentration instead. Or get your boon duration from elsewhere.
---
Crusader is slightly better, but not much. It has Power-Ferocity together, which is a good start... if you have enough crit chance to back it up. But then it has major Toughness without Vitality again. And then it has minor Healing Power. You never want to take Toughness and Healing Power together without any Vitality, because you'll start to overheal yourself too much with your base health pool. This stat combination is trying to be a hybrid direct damage tanky set, but it's going to fall flat in both of those areas and you'll feel really underpowered in both ways.
---
I recommend looking into the more common stat combinations most people use, depending on the build you want. Berserker, Viper, etc.
---
&gt;Basically since launch, I've been under a GW2 spell
---
really,though?
---
because i find that a bit hard to believe since there have been many MANY times over the course of gw2's history that there have been insanse content droughts and nothing really happening at all.
---
I for one wasnt spellbound by the game, not even under the following weeks after launch date.
---
you sound like a GW1 vet, but maybe im wrong there. As a GW1 vet myself, the game felt so vastly different i actually stopped playing after a week or so after gw 2 launch, and didnt pick up the game until a few months later.
---
what i guess im trying to say is that GW 2 has been a roller coaster in its ups and downs content wise, for as long as it has existed and people have been talking about anets lack of direction (not to mention its lack of updates) as far as i can remember showing that people think content issues has been a thing with the game for a very long time (content that actually means something e.g was persistent and replayable). 
---
i remember talks about it myself dating back to like 2013-2014, in one of the periods were anet didnt really do much with the game for months and months. (there have been several periods like that).
---
by persistent i mean content that wasnt just removed after its few weeks of uptime has ended, and by replayable i mean content that actually gave you incentive to always play it.
---
fact of the matter is that theyve always struggled with these things, and as a gw 2 vet (like yourself) you should be able to remember all the history of this game related to that, and should (in all fairness) come to another conclusion than the one your making right now, in that youre "spellbound". 
---
i mean if you were that,  thats totally ok, allthough i just have a hard time accepting that someone like yourself couldve been spellbound through all of the years of anet's troubles with the game.
---
To me it sounds more like someone who maybe has played the game for only a year or two would say in order to jump on the bandwagon.
---
because in all honesty, spellbound is probably the last word i'd use for this game. i mean, overall, its been a lovely few years and its a good game. but its not that good.
---
Why wouldn't they lock them behind story or meta events? It kinda kills the exploration and accomplishment parts of RPGs in general.
---
&gt;Mike Z
---
part of me think that's atleast one of the reasons Mike O left when he did.
---
he didnt want to stick around when that day finally comes, which he probably thinks will be quite soon.
---
Ah yes, the mission where Eir tries to get herself killed.
---
Fun fact: Garm isn't with her in that dungeon. It's the only time Eir and Garm are not together in the dungeons.
---
My highest hit was 151k.
---
On Banner Warrior.
---
I highly doubt this will be a one-dragon saga even if it starts as such. Wouldn't be suprised if the dragon theme is over after Icebrood-Saga.
---
Very cool! Love the style and video you posted of the process :)
---
Yeah it's way too big and the texture on the hands is pretty weird. Honestly they should just make another version, they've already done something similar with Fellblade and Lord Taeres' Shadow
---
But changing to 64-bit doesn't even improve performance, unless you're super low on RAM.
---
Plus, GW2 changed to 64-bit years ago, after HoT came out.
---
To me it seems like they wanted to increase the amount of mobs you're fighting in Bjora Marches. So they had to tweak them, just to keep them from obliteraing us.
---
But that's just my theory.
---
The healing signet (can't remember the name) lets you double-cast illusions by resetting the timers. Cast one or two, change target, cast another, cast your signet and then repeat. Don't put them all on one enemy if you can help it. 
---
Phantasmal defender and phantasmal disenchanter are both pretty decent. For your third skill, I'd take one of the mantras. 
---
For clones, shatter them when you feel like it. Outside a couple of mirage builds, you rarely want to keep them. The only time I'd really keep them around is if you need meatshields - you can use them to block projectiles. 
---
Sword is a good main weapon. The auto attack is good, and sword 2 is very good as it also acts as an evade. For your offhand, sword or focus is probably best - pick the one you like using. 
---
Greatsword is also pretty good. 2 and 4 are both pretty powerful. I like staff but it's only really amazing if you want conduction damage, which is more a raids and PvP thing. 
---
For traits, duelling, illusions and domination are all solid choices. Pick the ones that give you boons or speed up weapon skills and you can't go too wrong.
---
Let's make mobs hard again
---
I will never leave Tyria but as a player who sees Fractals, Raids as endgame content I have just accepted the thing that the game will never cater for me. It is simple. No matter what gamemode we are talking about (Dungeons, Fractals, Raids, Bounties, Strikes) ArenaNet don't want them to have high level of replayability, challange and high-tier rewards. Why? Because then the more invested players would make more money, would achieve significantly more and there would be no urge to buy skins and convenience items. Their goal is that players log in for the new Saga episode, see the flashy mount skin or weapon skin, splash out the credit card, buy it, play 10-12 hours for 3-4 weeks and then log off until the next episode. This shit could have been saved easily. Imagine all  the 3 new strikes all having 3 CMs that drop a prestigious mount skin or an equally valuable weapon skin. Make the drop rate 1%, hell even than the players would play the shit ouf of the content and even the casuals would say, ohh hell what, Imma try that CM for the skins. Then make the skin somewhat intertwined with a new Raid release where you can upgrade that weapon if you kill the raid boss for it. Boom, you have a clear-clut plan to help people into Raiding. This way Strikes just another game mode that requires less effort and time to put out compared to Raids hence they can (as they usually do!) abandon Raids and call the Strikes as the new fancy shit! But since you can do Strikes with your hands tied together it is no stepping stones into Raiding, plus why would they be if there's only 1 Raid wing every year not to mentiion the fact that they are decreasing in difficulty!
---
It actually does. Not the performance on our end but it would dramatically increase calculation capability on the server-side. What we have now is not the 64-bit engine, it's still a 32-bit that was made a little bit more compatible with 64-bit OS. There are only very few games and apps in general that use true 64-bit. Star Citizen for example where they are able to render the entire planet instead of very small area:-)
---
&gt;nobody who is in danger [...] should use "trust" and "something is coming" arguments but real facts.
---
It's been working fine for ArenaNet!
---
This might not answer your question directly, but, always keep an eye out on "World Boss Rush" : [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special\_event](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special_event)
---
During these moments, player will flock to kill any kind of boss to hoard the currency item, so many impromptu commander actually organize Shatterer "No Fly Zone" complete with timer. Use the event wisely.
---
&gt; Perhaps, but they certainly are fair.
---
They're really not, because it's completely ignoring the budget differences between games. Beating mmos made on peanuts when you have a budget like GW2s is not an accomplishment worth mentioning.
---
&gt; It is succeeding. It has been for seven years.
---
It *was* succeeding. It's in serious decline. It's silly to pretend otherwise. People are complaining because they think that it's at least in part due to the direction that has been taken. Citing 7 years is being silly, because people who were happy in the past are not happy now.
---
Disagree. HoT had better design IMO, due to the sheer variety of attacks they use. In PoF a few still have good design but are ultimately very weak and nonthreatening (djinn, hydras). Forged really aren't anything special.
---
cool tip  thx  i like it!
---
fwiw they didn't even bother to fix the headline feature of the patch that introduced the reworked customization UI: legendary runes.
---
Did it in the morning, same two polar bear furries.
---
&gt;Don't tie race to story so that race can never be changed
---
How this is significant compared to your other - very valid - points, I have no idea. Levelling a character to 80 literally takes 2 minutes these days.
---
Never seen bot in my game. Gold-play rank past 5 seasons
---
Waiting sucks, if you package it all together, it takes more time and there is *nothing* going on until then. That's why people left when there was no LW in content droughts around HoT (especially before it). When you know that every 2-3 months you get at least something....it is totally different than if you know you get something every 2 years only.
---
For someone who has this point of view, that you ain't the target of new content.  
---
I join this game because the end game is my choice - "Do I 100% a area? Do I do a story chapter? Do I PVP? Do I do fractals? Do I craft? Do I resource farm? Do I meta farm? Do I raid?", now taking into account, A lot of you have 500/500 in processions, several legendaries, seen each fractal boss 10 times each, and did each story chapter when it came out.  
---
When you have everything, and you ain't a completionist, but you've done all the grinding. In the past what did you do between waits, and have you thought of playing other games? the first comes from the fact if I feel disinterested, I play another game and the later comes from fact, I've seen content droughts before in other games, and even the devs in those games were like "If you feel burned out, or fed up, dont push yourself. Go away, play another thing or dont play anything if  you so prefer. come back when you are good and ready"
---
&gt; They're really not, because it's completely ignoring the budget differences between games.
---
We don't know the budget differences between most games, and can only assume. Besides which, most of the big IP games are also *likely* to have respectable budgets, as they are produced by quality publishers, and even if they didn't, the value of their IP is more significant than even a fairly large budgetary difference. 
---
&gt;It was succeeding. It's in serious decline.
---
It made more money this year than in the year after HoT came out, and roughly on par with the year before HoT. It's been extremely stable for an MMO, which would usually have seen an *actual* decline by year 7, rather than just an *imagined* decline. 
---
&gt;People are complaining because they think that it's at least in part due to the direction that has been taken lately. Citing 7 years is being silly, because plenty of people who were happy in the past are not happy now. We (largely) aren't complaining about the last 7 years, just the last one or less.
---
Different people complain at different times, but people have *always* been complaining. It may be new to you, but it's nothing new to ANet. As near as I can tell, a lot of the people complaining lately are those who enjoy some combination of PvP, WvW, or instanced PvE, which have all received less and less support from ANet as they've had less and less players (as *should* be the case, obviously). I don't see any way that ANet could have prevented this without wasting further resources on those game modes, so it's basically the cost of doing business.
---
Video picture reminds me how much I want the Fraenirs helmet.
---
Preferably without the googly eyes, or at least a way to turn them off.
---
You're making plenty of assumptions of your own there. You have no idea how many people I've talked to in order to form the opinions that I have about this game. The mental process that goes on when using this game's combat is only as great as you make it out to be, if you're holding every trait and skill description in your head as you time dodges and plan things out proactively and reactively, then sure there is a mental process. If you're just pressing random buttons and dodging sometimes - there is no more mental process going on than sticking Legos together. 
---
You **greatly** misunderstand empathy for sympathy.
---
Look, the combat is objectively not hard - it has almost nothing to do with mechanics or skill but balancing. My daughter (8) also plays this game, not often - a few hours a month. But she's more than capable enough to complete the majority of it, even some of the raids. Although she does get stomped in sPvP.
---
If someone finds this game hard, it's not the game. It's them.
---
&gt; You think that a game is what we need to grow and advance in life?
---
When did I ever say this? Quit pulling shit out of your ass. This principle of sheer laziness and magnetism to mediocrity that I'm describing applies to everything, not just damned video games.
---
&gt; I'm a full time carer for a disabled person.
---
Maybe you need to get out more.
---
I won't be discussing with you any further since you've proven yourself to be thick as shit.
---
I recall you saying something about underwater content though I could be wrong or perhaps you were joking.
---
Thick as shit huh? Pot, meet kettle. I'm sure you've spoken to millions of people and have a real idea of what the playerbase wants and is like and I've talked to absolutely no one and live in a complete bubble. Yeah, this conversation is way over.
---
6370/1528 = 4.17
---
3439/698 = 4.93
---
How do you get 5.5 and 5.1 ?
---
Actually the main reason snow truffles prices went down is because Red Lentil Saobosa came into the game as an alternative to rare veggie pizza. Nothing to do with a Big Anet Masterplan or any conspiracy theory.
---
Overall the price of food for raids and fractals is quite low right now and it allows you to keep your gold for other things.
---
I'd agree that the maps in gw2 are generally more full of life than in gw1. The problem though is the replay value is the gw2 maps, being that it's nearly non existent. Although gw1 wasn't the prettiest game to look at, the maps all held replay value due to the title system. There was never really a time where you felt like any specific region of gw1 was unimportant. Between skill capping, exploring, vanquishing, and all the other goals, almost every map had it's importance. Gw2 doesn't really have anything like that outside of the core game. Every new expansion requires you to achieve goals in that expansion's regions. Once you finish, the maps lose purpose. It would be nice to see some of the living world, and expansions, take more advantage of goals which require you to go back to older areas of the game. A good example was the Desert Gate. Something that now lies useless which would have been a great way to tie Tyria into the PoF expansion.
---
This didn't bother me that much because I felt it took me too long to get everything done in Grothmar.  Honestly, a lot of it felt like pure busy work. I prefer a zone with less grind for achievements. There weren't any bad ones here. Grothmar has some that were extremely repetitive.
---
Not to forget that many play ranger to the letter: by kiting at range. And that means no boons nor heals for them and thus abysmally low dps.
---
good to know, thanks
---
&gt; nothing is actually talked about, expanded upon, or explicitly announced.
---
Well I guess I must've dreamed up that whole thing where they explained that the upcoming episode 2 of the Icebrood saga is going to have a World Boss then
---
They actually have been pretty good about saying what they're working on shortterm(and even on slighter longer term things like the ingame build templates or the WvW Alliances), but I guess people forgot, or are ignoring it because it might not be the thing they want the devs to be working on.
---
1kk karma is worth ~100 gold via Pact Scout's Mapping Materials.
---
8k hours... 0 precursors (including throwing near 1k gold in the mystic forge the january after launch, when 1k gold was worth a heck of a lot.)
---
People really have a broad term of what maintenance mode actually is nowadays
---
I agree and that was the beauty of gw1, deckstyle and not a MMO, it was a coop-rpg and i wish gw2 was too :'(
---
Is this last night's tea time? I need to watch this ice that's the case.
---
I've played for 7 years in Feb, but now I am actually getting tired of all the "happenings: and "lack off*
---
I have only just recently seen what new MMO's have popped up or due to pop up that a similar to GW2 in case I need to move on.
---
Can anyone recom.end anything? I don't want an old established game and be behind.
---
Didn't wrap around a quadruped. Doesn't count as ripping off.
---
Seriously. You can find similarities to a dozen stories that have zero relation to each other. Why does this surprise people and make them cry foul?
---
Thanks for the response. I will try some of the things you said. 
---
I should have stated in my post that I play mirage atm mostly with condition. I rolled a new Mesmer to change races and haven’t unlocked chrono yet. Sometimes on mirage I can win pve fights and literally not know what I did exactly. I just know the mirage dodges are op lol. With mirage I do feel like I kill slower than I would if I was a power build. So once I get chrono up I will swap to it probably.
---
Strike missions and raids are really different, this mostly is because you don't usually get warrior banners+frost spirit, this means, tho you can look at numbers on snow crows site that gives you an idea of what number you should do ideally, iirc boon chrono is 18k or something, so doing 8k as first pull without banner or spirit is not bad try at all
---
They did however tell us that they were working on a new expansion... not havi g details on an expansion but knowing the studio was working on one was a huge difference. 
---
Also once it started up living story season 3 releases were more frequent, the content more co-operative/compact and there was a real mystery to events going on. There were also more raids and more fractals in the same time period.
---
Anet time is a meme because last patxh arrived late or is it like time in america where thwy their buildings are ?
---
Studio got too woke, filled with far-leftists and crumbled away
---
Lets just remember the good times
---
The sea dragon history
---
E.
---
&gt; GW1 maintenance mode great content added.
---
Maintenance means no content development. Maintenance mode started in early 2013 I think, 2007-2012 there was a live team doing GW:Beyond, that's different. We are basically in that stage now.
---
I'm curious how you guys are benchmarking the FPS. Especially 4-8FPS gain.
---
FPS in GW2 is so random, always different in every zone/instance. Even in the same zone it can vary A LOT.
---
As of now, it is just fantasy of people who are totally burned out of the game and want quit but need some justification so they came with maintenance mode. 
---
It is irrelevant for people who still have their fun. Don't let others ruin your fun if you still have one.
---
The mechanics are entirely useless besides unlocking chests. Your best bet is to pretend they don't exist because they do next to nothing to gameplay anyways.
---
That's reassuring. I was so scared that all my effort over 7 years was gonna be for naught
---
I wouldn't touch any new mmo touched by anet to be honest. Another 7 years of failing over and over again? And wasting potential?  It's enough for me.
---
Or you could build smething that's not relying on a dps rotation to bring down everything. Or would some dynamic fighting ruin the fun for you?
---
Game is down 5% from the last quarter, which isn't much in retail either way. The game is making about 12 million dollars a quarter. It was making roughly the same years ago, after HOT cooled down. I'd say the game is stable. It's not growing, but this fear mongering is just ridiculous.
---
Also It's getting around that time of year where holidays kick in and they go into this laid back mode until start of Feb.

Here is a set of general and boss specific tips if you haven't seen these yet.
---
He is. Mike O left the company and handed the game director position over to Mike Z.
---
Thanks!
---
&gt; Mike Z leaving is the last nail in that coffin.
---
If you mean Mike O, it was truly  a blessing. Unfortunately it's too little too late, he already ran this company into the ground.
---
well they said they want to use the maps for more than just one episode in the future.
---
so they just cut a single episode in half - voila: one map for two episodes.
---
I understand that, I mean I felt like there could of been another 1-2 instances before the end of the episode.
---
"There is a ton of data out there that shows that the "Live service model" gamers seem to hate so much is better for devs, reduces bugs, gets features/content out the door faster, makes it easier AND faster to resolve issues (meaning less downtime for users), etc. Ever wonder why GW2 has rarely had a true outage?"
---
I've seen as many stories of success here as of failures. For every Path of Exile you have an Anthem or a The Division (which only became decent towards the end of its lifespan). As for true outage, I haven't seen true outage in any game in like 10 or so years. 
---
Now look, I'm not a dev. I don't program, and I think it's safe to say most people here don't as well. You and your colleagues can laugh at us all you want, but at least my expectations are not pulled out of my ass. They come from looking at the MMO market in general. You have games like WoW and FFXIV pumping out big expansions every two years, with a number of patches in-between. ESO has released its third expansion with plenty of smaller DLC. Hell, even Neverwinter has had 6 big content patches already. I guess the people in these companies must be making magic.
---
&gt; They did however tell us that they were working on a new expansion
---
Where did you see this?  Cuz this was the last thing I seen..
---
&gt; Back in 2018, Mike Z sat down with Gamescom and revealed that Guild Wars 2 would not get a third expansion, at least not any time soon. Instead, the Seattle studio would plow on with the Living Story, an episodic injection of content that periodically expands the frontiers of Tyria while edging the narrative of the game further forward.
---
The difference is simple, at least for people interested in instanced PvE: from HoT onward, there always was something new to look forward to. They might have been shipping slowly, but at least new fractals and raids were coming. In the last not-so-recent releases, first quality declined massively both for fractals (after SO) and raids (after W5), and now we have pretty much official confirmation that there will be no new fractals and raids in the foreseeable future. That was the final straw for me, and I assume that I'm not the only one.
---
Well, shit can happen and servers can close, that's the natural part of online games. You never know if and when it is coming. GW1 runs for a decade since it got off focus...some other games don't. If you want all your effort to be absolutely safe forever, you should play singleplayer games or invest into real life stuff (but even those aren't 100% safe)....It is not in our hands and once the time comes...one has to deal with it. 
---
But actually talking about it before it is actual...it is as with illnesses or deaths - be aware what you are wishing for, gods might big enough assholes to be wanting to fullfill it just for sake of it.
---
PoF needed the HoT treatment at release.. not 2 years after..
---
Unless we'll find a hidden tribe of old, fully sentient and magical Jotun!
---
I wish for gw2 content forever!!
---
I just use Revive Orbs whenever I get them. I've fallen in too many of those pitfalls to know that I won't ever use them otherwise.
---
And yet there seem to be more people in BDO? https://imgur.com/a/w2hyMGY
---
Man you guys are chugging that kool-aid if you think that there is a new IP coming after....arenanet is closing down soon 
---
Iv never seen a gaming studio as far-left and woke as Arenanet and it actually  killed them
---
A living raider is always better than a dead raider. Doing mechanics good is more important than hitting max boon uptime and dying for it.
---
My tip may be very weird for you but honestly? I don't recommend touching raids in Guild Wars 2. You may really like it and after all you will become very salty and unhappy with the current state of the game. Effort you put into raids won't be worth it. If you really think about raiding in mmorpg then its better to start it in another game which is focusing on this aspect. Choose a good place from the beginning. Rather than doing it in place where raids are abandoned. I was a lot happier with the game before I started to raid in Guild Wars 2. Now I m thinking about quitting.
---
Old thread but I managed to fix my issue. Turns out that I had two different issues that both got fixed by underclocking my GFX card (1080ti).
---
The first issue was a sudden black screen and a completely unresponsive machine. The fans would spin up max and everything (minimizing GW2, opening task manager, restarting) would take ages as if all system resources were heavily in use. Usually I would resort to a hard reset to be able to use the machine again.
---
I resolved this issue with a "general underclocking". I'm using Zotac Firestorm (it's a Zotac GFX card) and it has a slider for "power" which defaults to 100%. This slider is linked to a "GPU Temp Target" slider. I noticed that the issue usually happened when the GPU temp was above around 86 degrees Celsius, so I lowered "power" to 75% which apparently corresponds to 80 degrees Celsius. This solved the first issue.
---
The second issue was the graphics stopped rendering. GW2 continued to play. I could hear that everything went on as normal - my character was able to move around, interact, and attack - but the screen was frozen. I could tab out to the desktop and everything on the desktop would seem to work fine and was responsive. I could quit the game but I couldn't start it again until I had rebooted.
---
I solved this issue by lowering the GPU clock and Memory clock until the problem no longer presented. I lowered with rather arbitrary amounts and both clocks at the same time - so I don't know if I've gone overboard or if I even needed to lower both - I'm just happy it finally works and I can play GW2 without crashing during meta's and JP's...
---
By "fixing" I of course mean I've stopped the symptoms from bothering me. I suspect my GFX card is somehow faulty and possibly deteriorating. Perhaps I could remedy or at least alleviate the issues by taking it apart, cleaning it up, and reapplying some new thermal paste. But for now this works for me.
---
More interesting at least. HoT enemies are much more clearly defined. Smokescales, snipers, etc attack almost constantly in unique ways. While awakened and forged spend most of their time autoattacking with pretty shit telegraphs.
---
This is not about the party/squad/guild/LFG system at all. This is about the core systems of instanced loot, gathering nodes, level downscaling, public events, and the downed system.
---
All these system train you unconciously to help other players out that you randomly run into while you do your own thing on a map. Someone else is downed over there? You help him up, because the downed system gives you experience for doing that, and that other person is not going to steal anything from you, he can only help you kill the things faster that you want to kill. And that's just one example. All the other systems I mentioned and probably more all combine neatly into making your gameplay experience to be cooperative in nature, before even thinking about a partying system.
---
Other games at the time of GW2's release were definitely not like that, and seeing other players on your map going for the same enemies you were going for were annoying at best and trolling at worst.
---
&gt; Basically if you did the opposite of what Arena Net are doing, you’d have a “best practice” approach to software development.
---
That's quite an exaggeration. When making such a huge costy project, you can't just do it wrong and still be viable. I've been in big projects like that, I've seen them collapse because of bad decisions upon bad decisions. It just crumbles, it absolutely can't stand. ArenaNet with GW2 has done a lot of things right. So you can't say doing the opposite would be a "best practice" approach. That's just wrong. 
---
There are lots of things that are wrong or badly done by ArenaNet, but it's too easy to just note what's wrong and say they are doing terrible and you should do the opposite. It's dishonest. Even if the recent mistake to split the team on several other unborn projects has taken a toll on the state of GW2, it's still an impressively successful project. During these 7 years of release, they tried formats (LS, expansions), corrected them, adapted, etc. For example they managed to have better results on second expansion than on the first one.
---
It's easy to toss advices about doing the opposite of something you thing ArenaNet is doing wrong, but doing the opposite actually doesn't guarrantee success either. So when you come with advice with "don't overly [what? focus?] on past successes" followed by the opposite "don't reinvent the wheel", we've already thinned out the use of your advices.
---
GW2 has seen droughts of content ('member the SW days), has seen outrage on the quality of content (drop after HoT), but has been able to come back on its feet. So yes, it's currently in a bad shape, they've done mistakes. However you forget now they stopped their other projects, they don't really have the choice to let GW2 go on hibernation.
---
Even if I'm not someone constantly waiting for PvE content like the disappointed players here, I understand the feeling, the worries. It doesn't justify to overdramatize it and transform into mmorpg.com forums.
---
Seems like pretty unrealistic expectations to me. I don't hear these kind of far along plans from games like WoW, FFXIV or ESO either, yet GW2 needs to throw all potential longterm plans on the table?
---
I think it’s confirmed Jormag is non-binary based on Anet’s magazine they put out a couple of months ago (and some Dev’s tweets). The voice actor is female tho!
---
Oh, yeah, I'd forgotten about that. Either way, I'm loving the character so far.
---
You must be playing a different game bud .. every mob has base attacks that are not telegraphed. Any major attack from any mob in PoF that I can think of is well telegraphed, besides, as I said, the branded. They have some shitty attacks that put some condis one you that are not telegraphed (human branded for instance have a ranged beam attack that puts slow on you).
---
Djinns have an Elemental Armor buff which decreases damage, which disappears after breaking the defiance bar. If you have enough CC, they will take more damage and get stunned for a while after breakbar, making them much easier.
---
Well you are not very descriptive about the spot, lol. 
---
However I seen at least 3+ camp sites around the zone. One site has live soldiers, those actually do have great stories (in southern mountains), one campsite near Aesgir's legacy has fire burning and tent up, but noone around, and one camp in northeast has dead body of some scout (interactable) and fire being off. Possibly there is more, and would not be surprised even if ghosts were around as well.
---
Just RP that your connection to the mists is unstable. And bam, it's a feature now.
---
Don't forget they added a new mastery so players don't have to learn merchanics.
---
They likely gave Fallen, Aberrant and Blue svanir new creature types to work with the essence system.
---
If they are not counting, and they don't make achievements specifically for them, you should report it so they fix it.
---
Also, mordrem do not have achievement either. Even Branded got one with PoF.
---
I currently run it on a ryzen 7 3700x, 16gn of ram @3200mhz, a gtx 1070 and installed on a Samsung 970 evo nvme ssd. Performance is great, everything maxed except for the 2 last options. I play on ultrawide 2560x1080. I get from 43 to 75fps(vsycn enabled) Which is great because its the range for gsync on my monitor, so everything is aways smooth. 6 seconds load screens too.
---
 Boring just like the map?
---
Forgettable
---
For me, usage has been 
---
* Skyscale: Go-to mount, really useful for cliffs and quickly dismount &gt; grab a node &gt; fly off without annoying mobs
---
* Beetle: Thanks to the recent change to it, it's not a racing-only mount anymore. Fastest mount on land.
---
* Griffon: Alternative to Beetle to quickly traversing maps when in high altitude. Also quickly recharges endurance for Beetle lol.
---
* Raptor: Faster than Skyscale, not as sensitive to terrain as Beetle
---
* Skimmer: On the off chance I need to traverse bigger bodies of water and can't use Griffon for speed
---
&gt; Basically, it's a mix of assholes on both sides yelling at everyone
---
It's arseholes all the way down
---
How much damage it does?
---
comes across as if some styles clashed together. someone desperately wanted to have some weird decorative swirls on them, especially the hilts, which seems atypical for all racial styles one would expect in that region - kodan, norn, charr (if you stretch it even for dredge, dwarfs, jotun, etc). to me they almost come across as very weird gingerbread weapons rather than anything related to the story or region.
---
SELL ALL YOUR STOCKS!!!!
---
But all that is only core to the open world experience of the game. Barring maybe instanced loot but drops in the game hardly matter so...
---
That's just reinforcing the one thing GW2 does well, which is OW content. And it's something many games aren't even trying to implement because they have OWPvP systems in place.
---
In the end its just a fraction of what players expect from a game like this.
---
they are good for ppl who dont like all the fancy and glitter weapons, like the gallant set. I def. have some more serious chars that could use them.
---
I miss Eir
---
What are the Aberrant and how are they different from Fallen and Icebrood and why does Jormag need so many differently named minions unless Bubbles/Steve is involved somehow.
---
I like them. They're nice norn weapons with a little bit of shiny, without being OMG SPARKLES. I love sparkles on some characters, but I like simple things on my norn :)
---
Only in the minds of salty PvPers
---
these swirls and engravings are very common in viking culture. I think they fit very well to the norn.
---
I actually love them. People jerk to sparkly shit all day, so I'm always happy about simpler design. Especially the sword is a godsend for me. Most swords are so fucking huge their tips clip into the ground, using something else besides Honor of Humanity or Bonetti's Rapier or something is pretty difficult. And we still got the ridiculous part like the colossal greatsword that I can slap on some norn or whatever.
---
If you don't mind being locked into one appearance, go for armor &amp; runes.
---
If you don't mind having to reapply sigils and infusions after switching weapons even for a second, go for weapons &amp; sigils.
---
If you like the skin, go for any of them.
---
If you do mind any of those, just get ascended for the stats you need: cheaper, less time consuming and less of a hassle.
---
Both are their own kind of "meh".
---
* Base: A 'could be worse' kind of "meh".
---
* Upgraded: A 'boring plastic look' kind of "meh". It's as if they were repainted with plastic-looking lacquer paint for a primary school assignment. 
---
It could be nice if following chapters added different upgrades for different appearances, basically different T3s that can be done with different recipes unlocked after doing T2, but I doubt it'll happen.
---
But you could imagine it:
---
* Fallen Boreal weapons: Parts of it turn translucent and reddish. They glow red when in combat.
---
* Aberran Boreal weapons: They turn pitch black. They leave shadowy trails in combat.
---
* Svanir Boreal weapons: They get frozen in blue ice. They get swirling icy effects when in combat.
---
It could have been nice, but not going to happen.
---
It may not create revenue, but will cut expenses in maintenance and future development. It still leads to possible bigger profits, though you need arguments and data to back your claims up.
---
That the game isnt making money is complete nonsense, the revenues are still stable every quarter with a normal decline due to the age of the game.
---
A solid "meh" out if 10.
---
Weapons don't have to be sparkling to be interesting, but this just feels uninspired.
---
So.. basically dead then
---
&gt; but the spell is broken. 
---
I have struggled to put words to how I feel of late, but you just nailed it right there.  Bought the game in Feb 2018, logged 3.5k hours since then  - so I think you can safely say I enjoy(ed) GW2, but for the past few weeks, couldn't be bothered to log in.  
---
Finally visited the new map on Thursday, did maybe the first couple of missions, then just logged out, leaving my main standing in the middle of some frozen field.
---
The spell is indeed broken.
---
maybe try mirage? you'll still dodge, but no roll.
---
I use them to drop on the Raven shrines when they ice over.
---
It changes at 4:30pm on Monday Anet time as announced by Clayton Kisko on the episode 1 preview stream on the 15th. Maybe the mods on the reddit can do something that posts this in the reddit when people ask.
---
&gt; bottomless pit
---
Since this points out that the norn who ventured inside were looking to find a path to the other side of the world, this would be an interesting way for ANet to lead us to a totally unfamiliar part of the globe in the distant future (a pipe dream, I know, but still).
---
* What happened to Ox, Wolverine and Eagle.
---
* How does icebrood corruption truly works.
---
* What can we use to replace Jormag.
---
Why would scarlet be waiting?
---
Not yet😉
---
Like others says. Focus on learning the bosses mechanics and pattern. As a Chrono you will need to know them pretty well.
---
Be sure you know how to do your boons rotation with CS (F4).
---
Be sure your position and Well placement hit your mates.
---
Help CC and pull adds when you notice them and Focus is available.
---
Have fun and don't put to much pressure on you!!! Chrono role can be complicated on some bosses so it's normal you didnt know and do everything perfectly at first pull.
---
I'm still salty that Mordrem don't count as plants
---
"For each season, have 12 dailies available each day : 2 per map'
---
beats tge purpose of concentrating players into one particular map per day,  to ensure enough players are around for events 
---
So, a hard no.
---
Anets change to rotating daikes, is perfect.
---
luckier than me. I got a key about 5 out of 20 times.
---
The closest thing I remember to it was in GW1 where there was a popular solo dungeon build called the 55 monk which used an item called Grim Cesta which was obtainable only from a quest.
---
There are classes that do specific things. However, if you play chrono or necro, your class will be nerfed, reworked and changed regularly. You will have to relearn everything every month.    
---
I don't know why they do that, but they do. Maybe they hate light classes.(ele is the exception, but playing effectively as a weaver requirest you to be a legendary piano player)
---
Some vines in the heart of maguuma do count as plants, but mordrem are no longer plants.
---
Because in it's original form it was more of an open world siege battles gamemode.
---
The greatsword is my favorite of the bunch. That shape in a giant heavy sword is really cool, and it reminds me of the good ol' days of Spiral Knights, swinging around [another sword](https://media3.spiralknights.com/wiki-images/4/46/Khorovod-Equipped.png) that also had a rustic-turned-refined upgrade path.
---
&gt; We don't know the budget differences between most games, and can only assume.
---
We can pretty safely make broad guesses that things like BDO and wildstar had budgets in the same ballpark and that things like maple story did not. That's all that's necessary.
---
&gt; It made more money this year than in the year after HoT came out, and roughly on par with the year before HoT.
---
Yeah that might have something to do with the months of zero content to either side of HoTs release! Weird to bring that up though since no one is clamoring for "please don't release anything for 9 months".
---
&gt; It's been extremely stable for an MMO, which would usually have seen an actual decline by year 7, rather than just an imagined decline. 
---
Um gw2 is only making 40% of the revenue it was at the start, you think that's not an actual decline?
---
&gt; Besides which, most of the big IP games are also likely to have respectable budgets, as they are produced by quality publishers, and even if they didn't, the value of their IP is more significant than even a fairly large budgetary difference. 
---
Why are you bringing up big IP games when I was responding to you talking about gw2 beating games that didn't have big IPs behind them? Of course final fantasy undoubtedly had a massive budget, but that's irrelevant when you're sitting there bragging about beating MMOs that *aren't* like that.
---
&gt; Different people complain at different times, but people have always been complaining. It may be new to you, but it's nothing new to ANet.
---
Thank you captain obvious, but you're out of your mind if you think there isn't *more* complaining happening right now. Honestly, just take a look at the reception that anet got for the two big live events they've held - heart of thorns and icebrood saga reveals. The subreddit was buzzing with excitement for months after HoT announcement, after icebrood saga it was filled with disappointment. You could also compare the response on reddit to the current release to responses in the past. Now this subreddit is obviously not a perfect representation of the playerbase as a whole, but it's still a decent barometer.
---
&gt; which have all received less and less support from ANet as they've had less and less players (as should be the case, obviously)
---
You seem to have the causal connection backwards here.
---
Not really benchmakring. But in heavy zones like LA and zerg the performance is consistent (-ly bad). So you can judge based on these situations.
---
Good fodder for unlocking the achievement rewards? I love that they are putting weapons into the game that actually fit the aesthetic a little bit more, but they are bland, and to be honest, it's way too late to start that again with everything they've thrown into the cash shop over the last two or three years. Even if you did manage to create a character that fits the aesthetic of the game using these new weapons, you'll still be standing next to Ms Galaxy Body Nuclear Green Ghostly Infusion on their griffon made of stars.
---
A lot complain about GW2 having old engine and other things.
---
But in reallity if you compare it with any others MMO you will see how amazing this game is even all those years laters and no one is near to dethrone GW2. IMO GW2 is the best action MMO just like Wow is the best MMO for a lot. So just like Wow, a lot call for the death of it but it's still up and running just like GW2.
---
FYI, about the financial situation of GW2. A lot of people are biaised because they check NCSOFT revenue by games. Sure NCSOFT have more profitable games than GW2. But Anet revenue didnt fluctuate like NCSOFT for multiple reasons. They have contract between them that share money but not equally. So you couldn't says that if NCSOFT revenue decrease from GW2 it's the same for Anet.
---
At first I was like eh, then... kaboom
---
Via quick mafs.
---
Its an old engine. Not much graphical overhead. And it has a single big ass thread doing almost everything. It was made long before multi-cores became a thing. This is how it runs for everyone. 
---
Plus it is an online game. The network communication stuff are always done on the CPU. Single player games (like pray) do not that these function at all.     
---
The mod will not force anything on the GPU. They only thing it could do is to run the GPU stuff more efficient.  You can always try it. you never know these things are complex. But do not have high expectations.
---
If we go even further beyond there could be some kind of "purifiied ice" Boreal Weapons. The icy trail becomes light blue Aurene style with swing effects.
---
Kind of like the https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Weapons_of_the_Scion Gift of aurene weps.

It's the newest entry when searching the subreddit for "ghost" (apart from your's of course)
---
It is, enjoy being stuck playing it everywhere
---
Its not a bug if you could remove it... Just delete your character and DONE!!!
---
No thanks needed, you are welcome!
---
&gt; That's a pretty crappy use of a mastery slot though, is it not?
---
As if that's some limited commodity.
---
First quest of Prophecies is killing several skales in the river, one of pre-Searing catacombs quest is lighting the candles in flooded corridor. It wasn't possible to swim, yes, but water wasn't inaccessible.
---
boon chrono is probably the easiest class to play in raids
---
Guess Kitty should be clearer about this one: this is just the route she found effectively for getting the map completed on alt army. It's possible that someone might be able to find slightly faster routes.
---
That being said, due to location of the tower, either need to go forth and back to get tower POI and doing that alone would take close to a minute. In the same time you can pretty much do the post-teleport thing Kitty did. 
---
At start, Kitty used jackal as it behaves best in that narrow indeed hallway and going thru the doors.
---
Skyscale might be better for getting altitude, but since Kitty doesn't have it, she used springer for those parts.
---
Kitty found going counter-clockwise thru the north the best option to glide thru that bear altar and svanir camps and to get to Asgeir's vista with least time wasted.
---
From that vista, griffon can quite fast glide to Aberrant Forest area and the logical end to that path is the cave POI deadend and from there Kitty found best option to WP to get those last 3 POIs (+gate as getting gate would've been 15s detour at start).
---
Fun story,  many raid bosses (such as VG) are mechanically treated as plants in the game code. This is so 10% damage against _____potions don't work on them.
---
Cool looking, too big tho, and like all other weapons forever and ever, you can't dye them
---
Because its different worlds fighting each not guilds I mean the clue is in the name.
---
Someone in raid squad wanted shiney infusions but could not afford the power ones. So they used the toughness ones, and had 1010 toughness.
---
I said this in other topic and got downvoted, just implement some kind of season pass that is worth for the players to buy, for some reason a lot of games are going for that business model... I’ll give the example of rocket league, got a huge boost with the implementation of season passes...
---
They did it specifically to give you a sad.  It definitely worked.
---
Just more conversation. I've been playing around with Vigilant, Tempest Runes, and just Diviner/Zerker filler for trinkets with a 1-1-1 Crono. (Man I really hate how Lost Time v3 sucks and doesn't have a place for anything esp. as a Grand Master.)
---
In organized play--I'm in SSC which speedruns TD and is realy good at it. DPS is 600k if I take Wells which is par for me if i go full Boon support. if I just take Cronophasma and iDisenchent it jumps to 1M which is limit of my DPS for skill level.One power crono in my guild can go 2M.  Don't know my boon uptime since I suck at reading tables but I'm always placed in the subsquad with the Carry guild mates that do 2M.
---
My main goal is trying to find a purpose for Lost Time v3. I was hoping that Vigilant my but key but I'm still trying to feel it out. 
---
(Prior for Lost Time v3 I played a lot with Lost Time v2. I was very adapt at interrupting mobs and bursting them them. I used Grieving, Sigil Severance, Mischief, Paralysis;  b/c I treat Conf as Burst damage similar to Burning. Squishy but powerful and fun. Vigiliant is definitely slower at killing stuff but not sure if it's more durable. *shrug*)
---
I like the way all those flax farms have destroyed the flax market oh wait
---
Not in Alaska during winter.
---
I think they are not doing GW3 at all. Look at NCSoft's revenue - 63% of their revenue are mobile games.  
---
Looks like MMO's cant make enough money to compete with mobile games. Also look at Blizzard and their strategy. 
---
I hate this.
---
I think Veteran Djinns have breakbars. At least the ones at the top of Augury Rock (guarding that Lost Chest after meta) have. Though I'm not that sure since those are the only ones I actually fight regularly, fighting them is a pain so I avoid them altogether.
---
RNJeezus is not happy with you D:
---
I want to know if Aurene has communicated with any of the other Elders since her ascension, and I want to know what they talked about.
---
beautiful! very in tune with the gw2 loading screen art style too! Maybe you're lucky and they're hiring artists
---
Like'em but still lack the "usable" feel, as they look more like decorative weapons you would hang on a Wall. Would be a lot different if only the hilt was made of wood with leather straps to strenghten the grip.
---
This fits for just about any decently large game if you pay attention to the community long enough. Some portion of the playerbase will feel neglected by game and become toxic. I'm convinced the core of this problem comes from players not understanding that companies who make these games are not their friends, and therefore should not be relied upon for emotional support.
---
Right, but you didn’t swim in it, it was a fancy ground texture. The engine had no notion of water as being a mechanical thing. Additionally, as I recall it had no notion of elevation, and if there is no height, then there can be no notion of a “water level.”
---
It was just a lack of foresight, which I personally find baffling considering how much work went into making unique underwater combat. They clearly intended underwater content to be a first class citizen at one point.
---
Smaller patches are usually just timegating bigger patch features.
---
&gt;The difference between a ff patch and a gw2 patch is huge.
---
FFXIV patches are usually few quests, same formulaic instances, level increase, tomestone recolor and some fluff like MGP or housing. No new open world content, no replayability after couple of hours it takes to beat new content.
---
GW1 to GW2 is meh, bits are missing, bits are added.  
---
GW2 vanilla story - "undead dragon would become to powerful if we ignore it and deal with other dragons first and hes drinking human god shrines power" - In theory, beautiful, in reality, felt sluggish for me and that final battle was uuuuuuuugh. (I avoid doing it)  
---
Heart of thorns - "Plant dragon and plant lads are its slaves in waiting" Again, cool, racism, fear, mind control. All good things, all interesting. Nitpicks very few. (I replay it for loot and alternative choices)  
---
Path of fire - "Human god of war is pissed and wants to destroy the dragons in a sense of pride and will let the world die to do it" - Cool in premise, in practice, eh? certain religion based characters become so fucking dense, I want to knock them off and ship them home and out the story.  (I replay it for loot)  
---
Seasons - mainly loot, since most seasons are 1 shot stories.
---
Man Vinetooth is just straight up a better Boneskinner. It's not just a random champ but an actual fun failable fight and it feels so much more threatening. Normal vineteeth regularly pop up and try to kill you as well. It also looks so good.
---
This is the case for Path of Exile (according to a dev on a gdc talk): cosmetics released during a new league update sell like hotcakes, cosmetics released at any other time sell terribly. So it's not even the case that the average player who returns for the update will look through all new cosmetics, they only mostly look at and buy the cosmetics added with the content patch. For the most part PoE now focuses its cosmetic releases around the time of a content patch, to maximize the amount of money they make with the exact same dev effort.
---
They get major updates with dungeons, raids, new races and professions... I could go on.
---
All we get here are non-substantial Living Story maps that become barren in 2-3 weeks after release.
---
Bear is still around in Hoelbrak. The spirit you're looking for that is green is Wolverine. (Also, Ox is interchangeable with Dolyak)
---
Dx12 would just update the rendering pipeline. It would have nothing to do with assets or shaders.
---
You allways want to stack to gain boon from fb &amp; rene ...
---
Viper SLB is not as viable since it ramps up way too slow for significant damage. If your team is better your personal dps gets worse, they just burn the boss in front of your eyes. Fractals have many downtimes where bosses phase out or teleport away, shield themselfes etc. so you ramp up dps to deals no damage at all. The better your other DDs are the faster you reach those windows.
---
Condi SLB is not bad its just that fractal encounter really suck as a non burst spec. So bring power dps or maybe condi firebrand.
---
Also even as "ranged" SLB with bow you'll allways want to stick around in melee range nontheless, you loose like half you dps if you're not buffed up and firebrands only have this godforsaken cone aoe so try to get hit by it.
---
Probably the biggest thing in raids, no matter what class, is knowing the encounter.
---
Ascended weapons bypassed that limitation by having different sets of colours. I wonder why fat concept hasn't been used again, for example the Restored set could easily have been three sets (red, blue, green details) based on the three mastery aspects.
---
This is not how this meme works.
---
Lyxor sends his regards?
---
When I saw the &gt;!starry ceiling in Raven Sanctum at the end of the new episode!&lt;, I got excited for new jotun lore too.
---
In regards to Jormag's communication, I think this may be a enemy of my enemy situation.  My tin foil theory is that the imbalance of magic on Tyria before Aurene's raise to Elder Dragonghood has attracted the Eldritch/demons of the Mists.  Jormag understands this and is more actively finding allies so that the planet can be defended.  This way the story will still be about the elder dragons but also introduces more elements that grows the lore by explaining their origins and why they must be in balance.  Maybe we'll learn more about 'mother.'
---
Whine about Wow being casual and play gw2. Unbelievable. Yes, Wow could be more hardcore but it's still at least 3x more hardcore than gw2 ever.
---
Yeah, but are they harder than those Veteran Magma Elementals in Siren’s Landing??
---
Given Rev is a HoT addition, can we still blame this on core spaghetti code?
---
not so common but does exist, see Jhavi Jorasdottir, norn necromancer and a leader of the Vigil. any combination works if you want to make it work
---
Hah made the same mistake as the one I was attempting to correct. Will fix.
---
I'd say it is less of a false assumption of friendship but rather the everlasting problem of companies going where the money is, therefore catering to the casual playerbase the most. But the people who actually care for the game and are invested in it usually aren't part of this audience, thus belong to one or many of any game's total audiences that are minorities compared to the casuals, which always have the lion's share in any player demographic. The people who deserve to be catered to don't, because they are few and don't bring in the money, and those who are basicly just there to burn time do, because they are many and bring in the money.
---
Of course exceptions apply here and there, but if you really break it down this is what it comes down to. Evidence is plenty - Heart of Thorns is a prime example. It was perfect at launch, keeping a player on their toes with unforgiving surroundings and having them think as they ventured the various environments, forcing them to return to places already visited after acquiring certain powers to overcome hurdles they couldn't pass then.
---
But alas, the outcry was immense and the entire experience dumbed down to prevent alienating the casuals, because most can't be bothered to actually think about the way they're playing and maybe adapting to the new requirements.
---
Its the entire Darwin principle going backwards in the games industry: Its no longer survival of the strongest from the player's point of view, its adapting to the weakest from the developer's point of view.
---
Wow my bad
---
Cause it would be misleading. WvW is like RvR so by definition WvW suits. 
---
Also Idk why out of all things that WvW needs to be worked on you decided to mention to change its name lmao
---
You shall not pass!
---
the tl;dr - look at the state of your account and char(s) now, figure out what you need to do to get where you want to be, make a plan to get there, and execute it!  
---
People tend to feel lost and leave the game because they're overwhelmed by the amount of post-80 content available, and aren't able to figure out what they want to do.  Then they start trying to do everything at once.  Don't do that.
---
I'd first suggest going through the returning players guide linked in the top of the thread for some good info.  If you haven't played in a while, I'd suggest going through the story quests (personal and LW) to get back into the game mechanics, learn the story and where everything's at, and get some rewards.  If you have LW episodes that you have access to but haven't started, then you have to at least start them to get to their associated maps.  With the changes to the daily reward system for LW maps (they're now on a rotation), the current daily map is definitely more active than it used to be.  You can also get great rewards, like ascended trinkets, from LW maps using map-specific currencies
---
If you want to get into fractals/raids, you need the proper gear and build, and know your skill rotations.  T1 fractals aren't that difficult, so you could start doing them fairly quickly if you have the right gear and build.  If you need HPs for the right elite spec, there are usually trains that'll take you to enough to max one or both specs.  Also look at your masteries.  There are some for fractals and raids, so you might want to get those, if you don't have them already.
---
What’s the easiest and fastest way to get diviner accessories? I’ve got exotic weapons and armor so far but I’ll need Accessories to start doing Fractals or raids  with this build (Rev)
---
I don't see why a Norn would avoid the practice since they think beating a drake to death with its own child is genius.
---
NCSoft only barges in when performance is bad. They have a pretty long history of making stupid calls, but they leave their developers alone when they're doing well. We only know of one instance where NCSoft actually made ANet do anything, and that was a mass layoff that ended with many veteran devs volunteering to leave to save new blood. As of right now there is pretty much one person in ANet that seems to have any passion, the new competitive balance lead, but we haven't actually seen any *action* from him yet.
---
There were even Norn necromancers in GW1

Two things make me nervous that there isn't anything on the horizon:
---
\- Giving away HoT for all PoF owners - while this is a good thing for those players I find it very strange and kinda concerning that they're just not selling HoT anymore. 
---
\- Updated launcher. We've had two launcher updates, each coming with an expansion, and each lasting a loooong time. 
---
Of course, I'd love to be wrong but I feel like I'm seeing the writing on the wall.
---
And how do you know it?
---
A Scourge Necro can is a good beginner option, ranged attacks, makes shields and heals from conditions.
---
Guardians are also a good beginner option
---
I normaly use a Guardian condition Firebrand or trap brust damage Dragon hunter
---
I recently built a power axe warrior found him good
---
Because ppl complained about random rar drops. A lot.
---
Looks cool
---
only the sub? official forum is litteraly filled with complains and critiques, the only difference is anet  censorship almost all of it, most reddit users that complain on official forum get banned and come here
---
I hope more like this+next area same size with its own stuff+then a third update to seam it together better
---
Are you on the list?
---
I've played SWTOR since just after launch and GW2 since early-access. For the longest time, SWTOR was the a game that held an incredible hold on me. I really loved that game. I got into GW2 also, but for many of the early years I didn't find much to do in it. I'd log in, wish there was something to do in the beautiful world, then log out and go back to SWTOR.
---
At some point around the launch of HoT, GW2 took the lead. I stopped logging into SWTOR altogether but would spend hours a day in GW2. Every now and then I'd take a break from GW2 and play some SWTOR, but it never lasted long and I'd go back to GW2 soon after.
---
At any of those times when I was not really playing one or the other games, I'd always check the reddits regularly to keep up on the news and get a sense of the community vibe. For a long time SWTOR was really going down, but in the last few months as this stuff has been happening with GW2, SWTOR announced and launched a new expansion which made significant changes to the game including a lot of QoL features that seem drawn from GW2 (e.g., an account wide material storage). The vibe in the communities has been the polar opposite, and the "attitude" and communication coming from the devs has been as well.
---
In short, while GW2 has felt like... well what it's felt like, SWTOR has felt like a game with a bright future. For the first time in years it is *exciting* to be a player of SWTOR, and the ccommunity really seems to be showing it. I've jumped back into the game these past months and really enjoyed it.
---
To be clear, I always did enjoy it but a part of of enjoyment was stuff I did with friends and when I moved on to GW2 as more of a primary game I lost touch with some of those friends and many moved on from SWTOR. I'd probably have played more had they been around any of the times I popped back in. I disagree that it's not a good MMO. I do agree it is amazing as a single player RPG, but I think the MMO aspects of it are at worst average to above average, though admittedly they had made some changes at different points that took a bit away from the multiplayer aspects of the game. Still, I'd recommend people who enjoy single player OR multiplayer stuff to check it out. At a minimum, those first two starter planets on each side tend to have a lot of people grouping up for content and the first flashpoint Esseless/Black Talon are always running, so for new players there is a lot of good MMO content to enjoy as they see how they feel about the game in general.
---
imagine this:
---
lets say an average hardcore player spends a total of 1000$ on the game.
---
an average casual player spends a total of 100$ on the game.
---
but the Hardcore players are outnumbered by 1:20.
---
so for each hardcore player spending 1000$, there are 20 casual players spending 100$ each for a total of 2000$.
---
from the companies point of view it would be dumb to go for the 1000$ from a single hardcore player.
---
The idea of having weapon skins that 'upgrade their looks' sounds pretty cool on paper, and it has amazing potential, but unfortunately it often gets executed like crap.  The "base" weapon models are usually just lame, colorless, progression steps that you'll never use.  The Boreal skins highlight this exact problem - the base models are grey, lifeless husks of actual weapons.
---
The 'base' set should still be usable and attractive, and then 'sideways' progression should be implemented - different colours (here's a red variant, here's a blue variant, here's a variant with a different colouring pattern), different effects (here's a fire version, here's an ice version, here's an earthy or starry version), or different auras (here's a glowing streak when you attack, here's a cloud of mist that follows behind, etc.)
---
What are some good elite specifications for condition damage build?  Rather than buffing stats for critical hits and critical damage, I want a character that applies huge bleed/burning/poison/etc damage, from range if possible.
---
Many of us fell for this trap ... so you are at least not alone :/
---
Anet aren't your friends but the game overall would most certainly be in a better place if they at least pretended to be. Playing poe and seeing how they communicate and treat thier playerbase and coming back to gw2 and comparing the two it's pretty clear why poe became one of the best arpg's of all time and only continues to grow even more massive despite only being released a year after gw2 and why gw2 despite it's incredible core gameplay, amazing world/lore and potential in every form of gameplay (pvp,wvw,fractals,raids,dungeons) continues to stagnate and decline.
---
Wife and I are playing through the expansions and living world seasons and enjoying this a ton. Unfortunately, I do find the amount of context to sift through somewhat overwhelming.  Specifically I continually find new collections and achievements to work towards. Occasionally I’ve found some pretty significant rewards (Mawdrey as example). Is there a good resource to identify the more “important” tasks to work towards or should I just stick with this gradual discovery?
---
"The people who deserve to be catered to don't" 
---
What exactly did you do to deserve it? If Anet was your friend, all the time and devotion you put into the game would merit some reciprocity. However, Anet is not your friend. It is a company, who has a strictly financial relationship with you.
---
In case any devs are reading, though, I think there's something to be learned here from my story and the stories of others: 
---
Make exciting announcements and people will return. Not all of them, but many of who loved GW2 and are now not playing and not spending money will still keep tabs on the community and when the community gets excited, they'll see and not all, but many of them will return. It's not too late, if this game is something that any of them still care about or even if just turning a profit off of it is.
---
I’d like to go back to the original norn homeland that they were driven from by Jormag.  That could be amazing.  Imagine if our character and Bran led the norn back home.  The norn history they could uncover in the ruins, or the emotion of reclaiming and resettling the land.... could really write a great story around that.
---
Actual esports competition in any game is basically a different game from what anyone else plays man. There's rules and sanctions and shit. Teams are actually communicating and have rapport and strategies that aren't just meta goleming. Instead of your continent analogy it's more like cooking at home your whole life and having never worried about proper technique vs going to work at an award winning upscale restaurant. You won't be completely lost but you will be completely outclassed.
---
Or that could be more people complaining on reddit about some topic. Reddit isn't a good sense of how many people are playing a game
---
But there is a festival horizon, you can be sure of that ;)
---
"Raven is associated with wisdom, cunning, trickery, knowledge, the Underworld, ghosts, and mysteries".  all of these we have seen in this map and story for the most part.  it might be raven's way of making sure we remain vigilant despite all of the suggestive whispers from jormag to rest, pulling a form of the Matrix "deja vu" on us by showing us phantoms, ghosts, and illusions.
---
or, based on Aesgir's diary, maybe it's not so much Raven and Jormag working together directly but Raven trying to direct us away from pursuing Jormag because of what happened in the past.  
---
the wisdom gained in the trials can be very loosely used in the the context of the current story.  First is the wounded norn and the healers.  Different choices in the same scenario can lead to similar outcomes but with different twists.  Will we pursue Jormag directly or focus on Bangar and Ryland?  Which do we favor more given past wisdom?  Second is the knowledge of the past while leaving the future unknown or the knowledge to ensure the future by forsaking the past.  Aesgir's diary tells us some interesting stories about his and Jormag's interactions and suggestions as to why Jormag set all of the leading events up and made the proposal seemingly out of the blue.  Might be history repeating itself in another form.  We also have some serious knowledge of elder dragons at this point and what happens if things are thrown even more out of balance but we also know how to kill Jormag as well.  Third is the Queen and the Prince.  Short term guarantee or long term uncertainty.  Kill Jormag and thereby stop Bangar's attempts at taming Jormag for himself and his ambitions, deal with the known consequences of killing another Elder Dragon and the potential unraveling of Tyrian reality.  Or ally with Jormag in preventing Bangar's charge towards Jormag, not knowing what will happen afterwards be it with Jormag, Aurene, or with maybe new factions or dragons waking up (if Jormag is awake now then surely Primordus isn't too far behind on the snooze timer and Bubbles seems more and more like the GW2 coming of Jormungandr...yeah).  Third could also be picking between Bangar and Ryland, though given current events thusfar Bangar seems to be the overwhelming majority of who to "escort" to the underworld.

[Take a shot everytime Mike and Collin say the word "challenging"](https://youtu.be/gxLkfXwxLTs?t=404)
---
Well I’m not saying we should change it NOW. If anything I’m just being salty about ArenaNet not doing the thing that in hindsight makes so much sense to my very important opinion. You know, what Reddit is for. 😁
---
That assumption reigns true if you compare player to player. But while one invested player may, well, invest more in the game, there are many more less invested players for every invested one. The financial strength of the casual audience comes from their count. On top of being the easiest to maintain because they're the least demanding (aside from the requirement to keep difficulty at a minimum). Supply them with new shinies wrapped in a lush hull of content and they're happy for the most part.
---
I think I just worded it wrong: I didn’t mean it was a bad MMO, it’s just not a really good one. The RPG aspect is amazing and the story is really good. As an MMO it is, as you said, average. There’s usually people around to do group content, and if you join a social guild you will find people to almost anything the game has to offer. 
---
I just got a friend to join me in SWTOR and we have a blast playing through the story in veteran mode.
---
Yeah I noticed that it does not do much damage.  My normal attack can out dps the fire bomb.
---
- The relation between Kodan and Norn.
---
- The origin of the Spirits. Or at least their relation to the Mists.
---
Note that Avaar was a villain and criminal. For example of a "good guy norn necromancer", see Weibe, the Havroun of Raven who's part of the new map's meta.
---
Havroun Weibe, havroun of Raven is also norn necromancer. Just my 2 cents.
---
If anything, I believe that Norn mesmers are the most rare in Norn society.
---
I like them, for the most part.  I'm hoping next episode we get the ability to upgrade them to ascended, and they get some subtle icy effect.
---
Obviously you are right. You can't go in the water or fight in it in gw1 (discounting just the water textures they put on the ground). But on every map where there is water that isn't a ground texture, like if it has depth, it's on the same level everywhere.
---
Are you able to show where they are? I wanted to take a look at them.
---
ArenaNet wrote the lore for professions and races so that, while there may be rarity, disrespect, or negative views, all professions work for all races.
---
Necromancers fall into the "distrusted/negatively viewed but existent" category, as far as humans and norn go.
---
In general for norn, it's always about *how* you use your tools, rather than what your tools are. Necromancers who disrespect corpses will be unwelcomed, such as [Avarr the Fallen](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Avarr_the_Fallen) from GW1, who bound those he killed. Alternatively, there's Jhavi and Weibe (seen this episode) who are also necromancers and viewed in more positive light.
---
ANet loves their Monty Python references, but this one was actually a reference to Alice in Wonderland and following a white rabbit down a hole.
---
Ooooooh that would be sweet
---
And they are. Look how many trainings are oganized. Benchmarks. Guides.
---
Hey there Neighbourino, I just moved into this realm and would love to have a chat. What are your favourite haunts? Any place I should avoid...? What sentient race makes the best minion?
---
I knew you can play through the flashpoints in veteran mode. You can do the story content, too?
---
What I mean, and it obviously went over everyone's head, is that OP is naive in saying that the episode had "nothing" wrong.
---
Liking the episode is one thing. Claiming there is nothing wrong is another and it's like when you're ten years old and you didn't care about seeing the string attached the Rita Repulsas' flying castle in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers because you love the Power Rangers.
---
They do have one but it’s not one they seem to care to share with us.
---
Same, and I was so sure that I would never use those skins that I immediately trashed all the “apply skin” items. 
---
I don’t mind that the achievement is like this, but it’s a bit disappointing that the skins which end up in the gem store are so amazing, on the whole, but the ones we earn in-game are so sub-par.
---
Hard to match into a set and does not stand out in magical particles nor eye capturing design.  Feels like it’s missing something.
---
Man, the fact that you basically associated all of Anet's issues down to potential political leaning is so sad...
---
It was made for vinetooth, and I think that's all that uses it - for now.
---
i think most of it will go into building the western infrastructure and advertisement for upcoming content releases like bns 2, bns mobile and bns m ( which are 3 new mobile games ) 
---
if they would heavily invest on arenanet to make them build a new game we would know, since they would hire quite a lot of ppl... there is no way they maintain gw2 and build a new game from scratch with 200+ ppl. 
---
at least if the game is not meant to be released in 10 years
---
Ah, love that good ol' Eye of the North concept art.
---
You misunderstood... I was not making a comparison. I was merely explaining that alongside mmo games, other types of games use this design. The intention was to illustrate its popularity in the industry, not to compare the two types of games.
---
Literally could not be anymore wrong about WoW being built for hardcore people. At the time of making the game, it was literally built to be the casual version of EverQuest. 
---
The notion of not losing an arm and leg because of dying was foreign.
---
they closed down in 2011
---
Let's post some more pictures from wiki.
---
THIS 👆
---
Generally Lack of communication, Because we don't know what they're working on in the background.  
---
After HoT Released we we're told we were no longer going to get dungeons only fractals (which have been a slow output), Raids (Also a slow output) and story episodes. It became a cycle of Release than silence, so when PoF Came and so followed the silence it became a bit disheartening imho, PvP has been dying since HoT's release and WvW Sees very little in the way of game-changing ideas. When it became obvious that they were taking resources from developing the game Alot of people had already left, The layoffs was also a huge knockback of confidence, and even the statement of "we are not currently developing another expansion" gave players a general sense of no hope.   
---
Currently we only know that there is a few episodes going in this saga but other than that we dont know what is being worked on right now. Theres not exactly hype or excitement on for the future right now
---
Sarcasm, right?
---
Seriously. 
---
The combat system of WoW was back then (and still is btw) a joke. Its so casual with its looooooong cast times and biiiiiig tolerance. I was playing DAoC when WoW came out, and we laughed at the combat system, because it was so ridiculously easymode.
---
Quests are 100% straight forward, nothing challenging as long as you dont go for quests that are higher level than you.
---
You can outgear everything. No skill needed.
---
There was nothing hardcore about WoW on release. Only when they added mythic raids did it become somewhat hardcore. But even those, if you arent into "first clear rushes" then you can outgear as well. Again, no skill needed.
---
And casuals being the "driving force"? What is it "casuals" (as in less dedicated players) are contributing to any community? Do they make guides, lead guilds, organize events, theorycraft builds? No, thats what dedicated players do. Dedicated players are the "driving force" behind every multiplayer game. Not the mindless masses of sheep slogging along.
---
Nice work! Very high quality and already finding this useful! :)
---
Agreed. You can only make so much content to guide casuals, until they get good at that content, feel like hardcore players and realize there's nothing else
---
GW2 initially was never made for casuals... it was meant for hardcore pvp... then since that didnt work they attempted hardcore pve and since they struggled with that aswell they are now attempting to nuke their own game
---
I think someone from higher ups got a feedback from our precious casuals who weren't able to clear moderately difficult openworld content, couldn't accept the possibility of the openworld boss failing, didn't want to spend more than one evening to get a shiny and refused to progress in skill for more demanding group pve content like  fractal cms and raids.
---
So he (likely not a single person) denied the only way game could have became sustainable in a long term in favour of pure "horizontal progression" and lowest common denominator kind of content.
---
"Again, The core game was very good"
---
Renegade, Engineer, Mirage, Soulbeast, Firebrand, Scourge, Berserker, Weaver, there is probably some good way to build a condi Thief, probably with dagger dagger, but I don't know how.
---
Granted: while condition damage is viable everywhere, the small health bars of most open world enemies is better dealt with using power damage. The big chunk of damage of power builds kill them faster than condi builds which need time to ramp up and fare better at longer fights like raid bosses.
---
Actually, it's confirmed that the next episode will involve us going to the Echovald Forest to learn from a very old green asura. We'll then need to go confront our father.
---
Of you're looking for exotics then look around the vendors in Thunderhead Keep. If you want ascendeds then any stat selectable one, except for the ones with prefixes, will have you covered
---
New no sylvari wvw meta
---
TFW anet announces black friday sales and build templetes dont go on sale but toon slots do because even anet realizes that its cheaper to buy more toon slots than more build slots
---
It's a bit generous to call it that, they just increased the draw distance.
---
&gt;this game needs to go off the beaten path
---
The game went off the beaten path since LAUNCH when they ended up not fully following their own manifesto.
---
Very effective armour
---
That's cool but when it Guild Wars Utopia?
---
560 gems for 3 build tabs and 2 gear tabs - noice.
---
Ok I researched arenanet as a company and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSoft) . I guess this guy is kinda right.
---
GW2 offers very little, highly specialised content. A good example is HoT. It caters perfectly to meta event farmers. For all other players is HoT offering no content at all.
---
Last map is a pure meta event chain. Tangled depths is hated by most players. So players are stuck with two maps only. 2H for each? 5? That's the amount of content HoT offers (+story). Many players also struggled with HoTs difficulty.
---
GW1 is very different set up, it has a higher variety of content which caters to different kinds of players. You got like 30 "world maps" full of quests and so on. For "explorers". you got storymissions for casual teamplayers. Titles etc. for title hunters. Elite missions for "raid players". So there is content for a wider audience. And even elite mission players enjoy storymissions (especially hm). Same as many raid players in GW2 also enjoy dungeons or fractals.
---
As comparision: raid players in GW1 had deep/urgoz - and half a year later DoA. "teamstory players" had their 13 storymissions of factions and half a year later another 20 for nightfall. Imagine 13 new dungeons (storymodes?) in GW2 and half a year later another 20.
---
Imho: ideally a GW2 expansion would be like 20 open world maps, two of them meta event farm maps - others for exploration, quests, ore farming, guildmissions, legendary hunt and so on.
---
10 "easy dungeons" for casual teams/guilds. Maybe 1-2 raids. Every two years or so.
---
This would still be less content/year than GW1 had. This is doable. It is more a matter of how the content gets created, than of menpower. If every single piece has to be a mouthpainted piece of art it takes more time.

---
What's a hardcore player nowadays in Gw2? Most people I know in game are like me, over 35 yo, with children, jobs and mortages to pay. We barely have time to go hardcore once a week.
---
Water weavers are a thing in pvp.
---
Sure!
---
The auction house is the same, but people still trade in cities and FC chats-- I highly recommend getting in an FC that's friendly and close.
---
The crafting and gathering is the same on a base level, but: Crafting got reworked to remove almost all RNG aside from procs. Now all your skills aside from the 2 50% risky ones have 100% success rather than 90%, 95% and 100%. Gathering base materials is the exact same as it was. XP rate for DoH/DoL also got doubled and leves give more XP now so it's not an extreme chore to level them.
---
All that being said, there has been a new crafter/gather game component called Collectables since the first expansion. You manually enter collectable mode when you first start crafting or gathering and you use a different set of skills to raise its value before crafting/harvesting. I'm a pretty big fan of this system, especially when gathering, despite not being a huge fan of normal crafting. Normal crafting is still used to make items like armor and housing decorations.
---
The only dungeons with unskippable cutscenes are the ones from ARR and they're so poorly received that they have their own separate duty roulette. They give a lot of tomestones for putting up with them, so newly capped level characters would benefit from doing one or two a week, but established endgame characters don't do them. They do *not* show up in any other roulettes.
---
The raids are fantastic, baseline raids are quite difficult and EX/Ultimate raids border on ridiculous at times. Even the story raids in Shadowbringers will usually take several attempts to clear.
---
Now that I've answered all the questions I'd also like to point out that the base game includes everything but Shadowbringers now. If you own the base game you only need Shadowbringers ($40) and a sub. It'll likely go on sale for Black Friday too. If you don't have the base game anymore, you'll want the base and Shadowbringers ($60 total) which has a month of sub included in the base game.
---
I'm really interested in Q4 because build templates are in it.
---
Are you seriously trying to imply that 2004's "casual version of EverQuest" would be considered game for casuals if it was released today?
---
I honestly really like the base versions more than the upgraded ones. I think they're actually pretty good overall.
---
There is no gear treadmill.  You either raid mythic, get 2200 or you have the same gear everyone else has, it doesn't matter what you do, as long as you do anything.  
---
The Jaina raid was the last raid I raided and if I recall, my best piece of gear was a super titanforge from a turtle quest emissary.  
---
Congratulations, you can match shapes!  Here's some mythic level raid gear.  
---
And they had those stupid island things too, where you go to this half hour snooze fest event you couldn't lose if you actively sabotaged it, and get guaranteed heroic level gear.
---
You can call bullshit all you want, he ain't picking up the phone.
---
Normal vineteeth do help the buildup though.
---
New elite spec lore, together with ritu lore. Then the actual specs + ritu.
---
Same.
---
&gt;WoW was originally built for hardcore players
---
That's completely false though?
---
Now I am curious as to which WAYPOINT UNLOCK BOX it is. Or, do we get to choose...
---
For real though, she can absorb him just like the others, and that means she's got leverage!  All of this "Jormag is murdering people we care about" stuff could get fixed pretty easily with a little negotiation.
---
&gt;Hi Jormag, I'm the upgrade, nice to meet you.  Let's find a way to coexist and give the races of Tyria a little break from all your bullshit.  Because if you don't, they'll kill you and I'll absorb you just like I did the others.  I win either way, so how about you play ball?
---
I would assume it is [this one](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Waypoint_Unlock_Box)
---
&gt; Oh yeah GW2 definitely blew GW1 out of the water
---
That is your opinion.
---
there just seems to be a few incorrect paths. but by the looks of your map theyre just short corridors that lead directly to dead ends
---
Truthfully there's only so much hand-holding we can do before players have to make a decision.  Lots of the more casual players that I run into in Fractals or Raids are incredibly indecisive and always second-guess their builds, gameplay, their mistakes.  We all play the game for fun, but I think the main difference is how people handle confrontation, criticism &amp; stress.  I think a lot more casual players play the game in a bubble of approved/disapproved players. 
---
For example, I remember doing Shattered Observatory with a larger guild before Firebrigade became a thing.  I quickly realized that the Chronomancer was using snap-cast to ground-target and putting their wells in Viraastra's purple miasma.  So, I whispered it to them, explained what was wrong.  I wasn't overly aggressive, but I was persistent.  So, what was the end result? ***They all left.*** and forced me to go pug Shattered Observatory again.  
---
The ~~"Fuck the pugs."~~ mentality applies to people regardless of whether you're a hardcore or casual player.  I think that it's sad that the game has become so insular and so clique oriented that people refuse to socialize or communicate.  I've had lots of relatively pleasant experiences doing 99/100cm training although I'm a little too burnt out for it right now.  The simple desire to learn, practice and improve is something that a lot of players in this game see as a chore and that's disappointing. 
---
I think the game encourages this mentality where "viable" replaces "optimal" for casual players.  Meanwhile, you have burnt out veterans that settle for competent, "good enough" gameplay vs. "optimal gameplay," that are shamed by the 01%.  I've had some good experiences with the 01% of the playerbase and some really terrible, unfriendly, toxic bullshit -- like of course a group that's stuck @ 100cm Arkk is going to have issues; if you don't like it leave ^/s. 
---
Finishing the "A Whisper in the Dark" meta-achievements took me less than a week.  I'm still resolved to do the High Shaman &amp; Boneskinner Strike Missions, but I'm looking forward to "Conqueror's of the Atlas," much more than GW2.  I think ArenaNet is stuck in a rut where they're pretty much forced to abuse artificial content longevity such as with Eitrite Ingots.  The entire Bjora Marche map is designed to funnel players towards the Reforged Boreal set. Once you finish the set?! 
---
I do think that players are being a little unfair with regard to the Bjora Marches, but I get it.  I think that it's a splendidly balanced lore/exploration w/ some good co-op/champion-design + meta-map, but that the formula isn't perfected yet.  The meta-events are incredibly weak.  The boneskinner either melts or boards the magic school bus, the Ice Daddy is like a 5 MPH escort rather than a boss fight and the huge 12 minute pre-event that precedes him? I thought GW2 was capable of more interactive boss fights; the magic lasso's aren't really cutting it.
---
i bet that 90% of veterans have already legendary weapons,at least for their main characters. so 90% ppl gona do this,bcs its literaly only thing you can do on this map.
---
My only comment here is that I prefer fire in open world for the personal fury uptime. Outside of that, I agree that water is much better now.
---
Either you're intentionally disengenuous or you have severe reading comprehension issues.
---
At least read the post I responded to? He said it was built with hardcore in mind, which is plain false.
---
Whatever its considered today is irrelevant to what he was proposing. Also it's still extremely alive? A lot of servers still experienced queue time during prime time, so obviously there are more than a handful who enjoys it.
---
Good point, and this probably speaks to the core of the issue. Guild Wars 2 is designed to appeal to the larger group spending the most total cash. The latest release fell flat for a lot of folks, but I think if we had visibility to the actual revenue after the patch we'd see a big spike in gems purchased.
---
Just buy a character slot and use them as a inventory mule (not as convenient as bank tabs, but a good place to stow all the crap you rarely use but don’t want to trash)

I guess you haven't looked at snowcrows:  [https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/tempest/power/](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/tempest/power/)
---
Kinda. Caused very high spike, and probably roughly doubled the lasting subscription count compared to retail version - if we take metrics like twitch viewership or sub count on reddit into consideration. Probably still have higher daily average playtime count than retail at the moment, but it's impossible to gauge accurately without actual data from Blizzard.
---
Why the f*ck is there a separate sale for HoT and PoF. Didn't Mike Z. said at their conference that it was bundled?
---
The sword holo build that I use is indeed the easiest build I've ever played.
---
The meta build for holo is not easy. It has less kit shuffling than other engineer builds and that makes it easier in comparison.
---
It has perfectly viable dps for raids. Not top obviously. But that doesn't mean it is
---
&gt; straight garbage
---
And I have arc and know I'm top dps in the vast majority of my T4 fractal runs.
---
That is a weird way to write "I want bigger discounts"
---
Those who provide the most value to the game should be catered to, not necessarily the ones that care the most. If you care a lot, but exist in a small isolated community and don't spend much money, you don't provide much for the game in general.
---
The both fail in the same way.
---
I’ll list you what turned me from a thousands-spending player to zilch:
---
- killing of dungeons. Fractals aren’t dungeons. Fractals have a gate for both requiring ascended equipment and AR. You cannot play any build as you like as freely as dungeons allowed you to. Speedrunning using stealth and portals was fun and made you think.
---
- i have no time to engage in raids. Tiring to find groups and to fill it up. Tiring when people get mad, or when you feel the silent tension when a noob player (be it you or someone else) does smth wrong or dies. I play to destress and have fun. This means a lot of content (incl leg armor and skins and easy ascended equips) are out of reach for me. I’m salty and feel mediocre. Would be great if there is an easy mode for raids (means same thing as raids just tuned easier. Strike missions do not fill this gap, unless they build it like a raid so many bosses in one instance). Not doing raids meant I had no content for the past 3 years.
---
- LS3/4 hearts were a chore. Never want to do them again. To me I avoided them like the plague.
---
- installing spyware into our game
---
- false positive bans. What if I spent so much money only to be banned one day? And seeing so many accounts of the CS being so dismissive to the player requests to look into it really got me jaded. Especially when it turned out that they were wrong actually.
---
- Mike’s silent rule on only saying things when they’re confirmed. I mean ok makes sense, but where are we heading now exactly? Are elite specs even still on the table?
---
thats about the deluxe upgrade via gem store
---
I think there might have been a thread or two about soloing the hoarder.
---
Oh! I apologize, I did not see that. Thank you!
---
Hmm, well good to know others are using Water in Open World and competitive modes. It definitely gives more sustain.
---
And we have two more Strike Mission bosses to kill :pog:
---
I imagine that you really wouldn't want to drop instares lavafont in the openworld.  Plus burstier damage dealing skills are still in fire, half of the water's dps boost comes from the "scholar" bonus that you aren't likely going to maintain for much and water sustain doesn't do a lot without healing power and active regeneration application.
---
Using your definition as an example: someone roughly half that age, none of those responsibilities, and no obligations allowing them to grind a videogame all day... literally.
---
To this day, still have not done all the Dungeons. Maybe I should.
---
What content does a hardcore player create that caters to the casual crowd? A causal player cares about things like lore videos and collection guides. Do you think that losing raids really drives away the players that make casual guides, or do you think the hardcore players are making something I'm not thinking of?
---
As a former wildstar player, I just kind of laugh whenever anyone accuses this game of going into maintenance mode with the amount of money it's still making. Wildstar didnt even get it's own graph for multiple quarters of revenue reports and still got some minor shit.
---
People need to chill with the doom saying, or its just gonna eventually become a self fulfilling prophecy.
---
Each Living Story after 2 has a overarching "did you do everything" reward. In LS4, that's the skyscale--so, check to see what you need for the things you want to get the most out of your playtime.
---
Basically this. I can list a million reasons why every aspect of the game is meh at the moment but to encapsulate what I feel about GW at the moment:
---
 GW2 is now a telltale game with cosmetics. 
---
Every update to the game that has occured since launch has slowly driven it towards this outcome. I remember when GW2 was advertised as an MMO that caters to all player types and everything you did as an individual had an affect on the world around you and there was no grind. The game was fun when they launched it, even when it lacked an endgame and there were countless exploits.
---
Lunar is late February. Episode 2 would be either late January or early February.
---
And mostly a useless item since blitzing around on a mount can get you most of the WP's in a region in like half an hour. Still, it's free and it might help with future world completion. Need to stock up on those Gifts of Exploration. Can these free items be given as gifts between accounts?
---
So what? No one said maintenance mode has to be shitty content.
---
interesting, full zerk keeping up perma alacrity, and tablet is block not reflect
---
This is the secret the devs know and the casuals know, but the hardcore are fighting tooth and nail to deny and disprove without evidence.
---
I have money but not time. 2 hours of story, 10 hours of basic achievement grind keeps me in the game for 2 weeks. Add some heavier grind like these weapons and I'm in for a month or two, maybe more. In that time, I might spend gold conversion or cash on mount skins or something if there is something I want in the store.
---
&gt;Oh wait, it was released "today" with Classic. And what was people reaction? Too grindy, too boring, requiring too much time, and only for people who can spend hours daily on getting their characters into somewhat decent state.
---
People consume content differently these days, the expectation now is that you’re supposed to hit the level cap anywhere between week-month one, and be engaging in endgame content with a progression system that replaces leveling (although it’s still just leveling, developers have to trick people into thinking they’re all powerful while still providing a progression system now or they’ll say your game sucks.) 
---
It used to be that the whole leveling system was a core part of the game and the endgame was for ultra dedicated players, there was also very little extra content in the endgame and updates to the game didn’t typically focus on endgame content but instead in enhancing the whole experience form level one, all the way to the cap. 
---
Yeah it was grindy, it was built to be. It used to be that you would dedicate an hour or so a day working towards a long term goal of gaining about 10 more levels. That was something that was supposed to take you a pretty long time. 
---
What people loved about MMOs is that unlike single player titles, MMOs were games that would last you practically forever and levels were spaced so far apart that you and somebody who were relatively close in level could work on your characters together without worry about completely leaving each other in the dust on a single missed day. You’d be in your level 30’s for months and that was okay because you still felt like a bit of a hot shot, not being in your 10’s or 20’s any more.
---
What we gained in MMOs with speed of leveling and QUOL stuff, is this feeling that you’re actually participating in a whole other life. MMOs no longer feel like an escape from reality.
---
Looking at my world quests right now and they're not awarding heroic level raid gear even though the ilvl reward on them is the highest it can be, strange
---
I really enjoyed the increased mob density. It reminded me a lot of launch Orr and HoT.
---
cause ANet doesnt support GvG
---
I feel like this information should've been more transparent, at least noted in patch notes. I think scrubbing though multiple videos is more tedious than skim reading blogs, just to find one key information you want to understand.
---
Thank you. :)
---
this game still has economy?
---
Cool! I’ve got so many WvW currencies since I was working on WvW as my means to get legendary armor and never noticed trinkets
---
My guess for HoT and PoF is that they tried to make them really different.
---
HoT is a stifling jungle where PoF is a massive desert.
---
HoT is totally focused on Mordremoth while in PoF Balthazar is a stranger to Elona.
---
HoT main story is the maps, and it ends with a meta-map. PoF main story doesn't care about Elona lore and the player had to explore.
---
My main problem with PoF is that the maps are too big and there are way too many players in each instance.
---
Fresh Air Tempest uses water instead of fire.
---
I’d spend $20 on the gem store for that outfit ... ANet wink wink nudge nudge
---
&gt; next few years of GW2
---
Oh you have way too much hope. I'll be surprised if they get to finish Icebrood Saga.
---
+134 Toughness  
---
+96 Healing Power  
---
+96 Concentration
---
Eat Chilis, and then sit on Eternal Ice to counteract what eating Chilis would do to the rear end of your digestive system.
---
Norms have cold resistance?
---
Yeah that’s what it is, and they go skimpy to show off how little the cold bothers them.  It’s an ego thing, very Norn.
---
Also, Quiet breathes through her skin!  ;)
---
Spirit gum!!
---
&gt; Colins Hype Train was missing at PoF release... 
---
How many people did they lose because of HoT? How many of those would be willing to believe whatever they were saying about PoF to come back?
---
It absolutely fits.
---
Norn are about nature and spirits. Death is a part of nature, and of our path from life to a legendary spirit. A norn necromancer would likely hold this grim part of nature in high regard, and might even have a deeper-than-most respect for the sacrifices of those who made life possible for future generations. Because every corpse can become a servant to a necromancer, so too can a hero's death serve the wellbeing of their people.
---
I hope you enjoy it! Tempest became my favorite for all kinds of open-world meta events (especially as a commander) for the triple threat of the game's strongest power burst damage (for the first 17 seconds), the healing, and the boon support of Heat Sync and Sand Squall to extend powerful boons and share 25 might/fury with 10 targets. As a commander, having the burst to be top DPS in the squad is good, but knowing the bulk of your squad has their offensive boons covered and being able to personally contribute burst healing during dangerous times is great!
---
Uh maybe he didn't want to have the whole screen in the picture?
---
phone pics never get old, time to meme.
---
How does it even stay on? Suction?
---
Thanks mate!
---
Thanks, I checked it and it looks like it's only for stuff from the gem store, not the actual expansion.
---
Thanks, I'll check that and see what it says.
---
I wish they'd put raids on maintenance mode making some people finally leave. Instead of lurking about, filling the forums with those "game is ded" threads every second week. 
---
If GW2 doesn't offer enough content for you, it's ok to go play something else. Everyone does. There's a ton of good games out there. Do we really need this circlejerk of "oh noz! Uh-Net just wanna sell gems!" every second day? Don't we have anything better to do?
---
If the game is dead to you, move on. It's getting to be like in an abusive relationship.
---
&gt;But that's the thing. As a customer, I don't give a rat's ass to the whys and hows of companies' development cycles, how much they can afford to spend or how much personnel they can allocate to work on this or that, etc. None of that matters to me or to the market at large. At the end of the day, ANet is doing less than their competitors in pretty much every regard.
---
That's relative to player expectations. I do think ANet has fallen short in some areas, but I also think they've done better than others. GW2's competitors are WoW and FF14, not PoE or Warframe. At least, not their direct competitors. PoE and Warframe are great for the types of games they are, but I wouldn't replace an MMO for a Loot RPG or Looter Shooter.
---
It should matter to you and the market as it tends to be why some game studios go under. If they push their devs too hard just to make some small, loud percentage of the player base happy, those devs will just walk and find new work. Not to mention that customer/player demand doesn't magically make technical hurdles go away or scientific/mathematical laws change. Simply put, sometimes what the customer and/or business wants simply isn't possible in an existing environment simply due to existing code applying logic or principals in a way that can't be worked around without time to work on changing the entire section of code (or infrastructure). And, no, it is absolutely no dev's job to work more than 40 hours a week so you can play a game.  
---
&gt;The few games I've seen rise above their competition in this kind of  situation (namely Path of Exile and Warframe) have done so by doing  pretty much everything that ANet doesn't - having an almost exclusively  cosmetic cash shop, listening to their community, and being pristine in  their communication with us.
---
I can't argue about PoE's communication. It's great, but it's also important to note that they are an exception rather than a rule. We can strive and hope for other companies to be like them, but it's usually unlikely.  As for the Cash shop, most of what ANet has are cosmetics with a few convenience items and character slots. The same kind of stuff PoE has (last I knew you still had to pay for bank slots).
---
Again, PoE is also a very different type of game. With the majority of the game instanced, this leaves them open to try things a persistent world like WoW, FF14, and GW2 cannot do without causing huge problems. These games, even PoE, are incredibly complex and we all know that ANet has a huge amount of technical debt. Debt that needs to be worked on, but can't because the player base keeps demanding more content and features. 
---
&gt;Meanwhile, ANet treats any sort of criticism as toxicity, communicates  as well as a mentally challenged newborn, and every patch note seems to  have more space for the cash shop and less for anything else.
---
Too many people in this subreddit hide behind the "criticism" argument to justify their toxic or demeaning comments. There's a difference between an angry outburst and actual, constructive criticism. On top of that, this subreddit has regularly ignored both ANet and other Developers trying to explain why what they ask for can't be done as if the commenters on the subreddit somehow know more about the GW2 codebase (or how to write complex multi-service programs) than the experts. 
---
&gt;So far, all I see is more of the same with a different name. Call it  "saga" so our white knights can claim it's going to be different. But  will it really?
---
All I said is that we have to really wait to see if the "Saga" change does change things for the better. *All that I am saying* is that there is no way to know if the Saga will work after 1 prologue and 1 episode. What takes our team a couple of months to determine if something is working will take someone like ANet 4-6 months to really know for sure if it is working. It'd be different if they deployed 1-20 times a day as we do, but they don't.
---
&gt; Their whole game is aimed at being accessible to casual players.
---
The game was supposed to be pvp esports.
---
&gt; When casuals buy an expansion to find out that the core content is too difficult for them to enjo
---
HoT is not core content, it's expansion content, content for max level characters that should have max level gear.
---
A top is a single thing, but that's clearly two heavy plate pasties, bracers and a choker.
---
Gotta protect the soft bits.
---
It kind of makes sense for norn to cover their upper body so little, when they are so tall few things can hit them up there, and anything that can hit up there would pretty much ignore the armor.
---
Um, source? Because that sounds like a total load.
---
You're right no one said that. You don't deploy 3 alternating teams alongside a raid/fractal team to keep a 3 months cycle of content during maintenance mode. 
---
Just cus the content was shitty doesn't mean it was part of 
---
"maintenance mode".
---
The same way Captain America holds his shield.
---
It's definitely a lot easier with fewer people. I managed to get it done on a map that was closing when there was only &lt;10 of us there, the break bar melted, and I for one wasn't using the special skill because I hadn't finished that mastery yet. Regular CC seemed to work fine without it being upscaled. But it seems to get swarmed every time it's up on most maps, probably because it has at least three or four achievements attached to it.
---
*Strike bosses, ftfy
---
A big shit, but free...
---
1 - I haven't leveled in a veeery long time so i honestly wouldn't know, but i'd prolly guess a month or less of nice casual play. #1 thing is to remember that EVERYTHING in this game that you do will usually give exp, so literally do whatever you wish... have a good time &amp; have fun!
---
2 - I've played this game solo for 6+ years, you're GOOD. Also, the game is designed in a way where everyone ends up coming together anyways when they need to. Or you use the LFG tool in your friends/party menu to sometimes find people for something you'd like to do.
---
3 - Someone recommended Thief ... I'd agree sort of, we have plenty of mobility and sweet dodges, but Thief needs to react super quick to many things quite often. I'd suggest to play something that is ranged :D
---
She didn't lose the power to become Bear because of her resisting Jormag. She lost it because she became turmoiled and distraught. She regains the ability once she resolves her issues and her guilt over the loss of her brother. 
---
Braham is also unable to become Wolf and apparently it's been a thing for a long time now.
---
It's just not useful to everyone, I'll gladly use it on an alt that I don't use often for WP access.
---
... and Jora quickly realized that she was now outside of the tutorial area and that skill didn't deserve a spot on her bar anyway.
---
And prevent chaffing and chapping, of course.
---
Under the fur.
---
What? City of Heroes rights have never been sold, if you mean the current emulators they are just letting them exist. Wildstar was developed by Carbine a fully owned subsidiary of NCSoft like Anet.
---
I'm the same, thousands of hours in the game no precursor.
---
and here I am, can't even finish one damn legendary weapon.....
---
Don't expect those to go on sale until Anniversary Sales in August. Though, maybe if they're in dire straits and desperate for money, they could go on sale in April. That's a big "if" though.
---
And I would be VERY surprised to see them go on sale for Wintersday. It's not impossible, like maybe 1% if their q4 earnings are as godawful as we think they'll be (sub-Aion would be doomsday scenario). Time will tell.
---
Character slots are pretty good, but nothing comes close to permanent bank contract in a shared slot with full bank tabs imo.
---
When I say poor design philosophy I mean from the point of view of making a good product. As a player if you're going to assess the game from a pure money making POV and completely ignore the quality then you may as well give up.
---
So why are you saying no company would do that when you're in agreement with me.
---
Definitely getting the 'ancient nor~~d~~n'  vibe from them. Restored mace skin is fantastic. That is all.
---
being toxic without being able to read.
---
What caused her being unable to become the bear has conflicting stories, but it wasn't her guilt. Incidentally there's a dialogue that addresses the contradiction:
---
&gt; **Veteran Relief Crew Scout:** Some believe the Spirits of the Wild punished her for doing nothing to stop him. Others think Jormag was to blame. 
---
Even if we ignore GW2 dialogue, and just take GW1 dialogue, it's conflicted. Either it was Jormag's influence that prevented it, or Bear revoking the ability.
---
She regains the ability after *killing her brother*, not after resolving her issues and guilt over the loss of her brother. After killing her brother, she still seeks out Bear for further redemption, but is able to take on Bear Form (though she cannot mechanically).
---
Nothing says Braham is unable to take on Wolf Form. ArenaNet just never put the skill on his bar. Same with Eir (except in one instance).
---
Oh, well my bad on the misunderstanding. But my point still stands. That type of development can work for games like CoD but for an MMO it's a pretty bad idea because it's a single game on going for at least a whole decade, if successful. 
---
You can argue WoW doesn't go back and change old stuff anymore but there's really no need to. WoW set it self up in a good spot WAY before they ever even needed to consider updating old stuff.
---
And even then, WoW still did update old stuff. They revamped their leveling, revamped the entire old world and brought it up to be current in the timeline for the then expansion Cataclysm. It's obviously stuck in time again.
---
They updated character models. Their engine saw massive graphical overhaul in a lot of areas. Their fucking water got updated. WATER.
---
A-Net can't even get their dungeons right. And you can't say it's because A-Net has less developers, which isn't entirely true. They're not Blizzard big but they have over 200 employees all working on ONE SINGLE GAME. I'm aware that this wasn't the case recently but they launched with GW 2 only, developed exclusively GW 2 for years and are now again, stuck with only GW 2 because they couldn't even manage their shit right to make another IP or game.
---
Fractals were a nice addition but that didn't mean that they should have abandoned dungeons. All they had to do was use the success of fractals to formulate a new dungeon formula, one that wasn't a cluster fuck full of shitty mechanics. And then they could have included at the very least 2 per expansion. But they totally gave up on that. 
---
The only time they touched old content for an update was when they did the NPE. Which was a questionable update in of itself. They removed a section of it, made the final instance doable by yourself(which was probably the only good change) and just really screwed up a lot of the early levels by removing mechanics that were deemed "too hard for new players"
---
It's fine to re-invent the wheel now and then. Get something fresh and cool. But don't let everything else rot for the sake of impression.
---
Hell, ESO saved its ass by doing precisely that, looking back at what was done poorly and what could be improved and they did exactly that, improved. If ESO would have been managed like GW 2, they would have ignored it and invented something flashy and new rather than fix their problems.
---
Honestly, I like a lot of them. They're not all winners, but pretty solid. I wish the finish looked a little more metallic, though. The Norn design style hasn't really been represented outside of weapon sets the game launched with (the three racial sets you can buy with karma (Shiverpeaks, Norn, and Wolfborn) and the Etched weapons), so I'm glad to finally see something new on this cool but neglected front.
---
My primary characters are Norn, and I like that aesthetic (designs with the banding and Celtic knot-style patterns), and I also tend to fall on the lighter side of particle effects preferences in my fashion wars stylings, so this set is kinda primed to deliver something I'm looking for.
---
As a side note, on Norn characters (the ladies especially), weapon size scaling is weird - like, it's scaled by race, but male Norn are all-around "larger" characters, so a lot of weapons that might feel size-appropriate on a male Norn, or when scaled down for a human-sized character, feel weirdly chunky on a Norn female. Axes have this problem a lot, and probably 60-70% of 1H swords clip into the ground when sheathed. That sizing problem is still here, to some extent, but overall, a nice set that gets by on design rather than gimmicky sparkles/auras.
---
By Ogden's hammer, what savings!
---
Is it just me or all the codes have been used up?
---
Norn animal forms aren't actual shifting like, say, werewolves. They're spiritual forms that occur over their normal form. Best depicted during [The Nornbear GW1 cinematic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oWZHVImL6o).
---
Comes from Ghosts of Ascalon. It's the canonical reason for why they're all half-naked in GW1.

---
The only free things that are actually useful are the trans charges and the waypoint unlock box. I wouldn't mind an extra rez orb though, but the booster? I have like 50 of them somewhere in my bank. I don't think I've ever used one...
---
I get the feeling that the waypoint box only unlocks one waypoint.
---
I've got plenty of as I can use it on, but if it's the item linked elsewhere in the thread, it's only *one* area, ie, Kryta, Ascalon, Shiverpeaks, Maguuma or Orr. It's not useless, but it is rather limited.
---
Works for everything since the dawn of time. Funny, in a tragic kind of way.
---
Sweet! a revive orb!
---
I feel like "oh you have rose tinted glasses you just don't remember it" is a criticism throw at people who reminisce about HoT fondly far too often here, especially considering there are a lot more hardcore (or ex-hardcore) players on reddit than there were in the game in general. I thought HoT was great before they "fixed" it, I thought gerent was great before they castrated it, I thought Tarir was annoying and unfun on day 1, and I thought HP trains were for babies day 1 and relished the challenge of an actually difficult hero point with incentives to be completed repeatedly. HoT was a fucking good-ass time, *especially* during the first few weeks when everything was new, people were actually training different masteries at different times, and killing gerent was a fucking achievement. I know I'm not alone in feeling like this, not by a long shot.
---
Maybe that was just PR talk.
---
He isn't.
---
Can You get me one as well? I dont paying the money for it. I just have none nearby me that offer it or the workers are just intentionally stalling me on the phone everytime
---
I have the 3700x and absolutely love it. I upgraded from an i5-4690 when. The ryzen came out.
---
&gt;Similarly, they began to focus solely on content they KNEW they could produce: A new map, some new masteries, a bit of story.
---
This also represented a major limiting of focus by Anet too. Consider that HoT brought it with it additions to every game mode and it wasn't just PvE that got panned. It was all of it. WvW got the Desert Borderlands which damn near killed WvW and PvP got Stronghold, whose most notable achievement is being so lowly populated that people would exploit it to progress in Ranked.
---
With HoT Anet really swung for the fences and landed flat on their ass because the content they produced was out of touch with what their playerbase wanted. It was also the last time that Anet really went all out like that. Post-HoT Anet didn't recognise that they should have been more open and more connected with their community to better get their fingers on the pulse of what players wanted. Instead they did the opposite, pulled back into their shell and focused primarily on living world.
---
Took me about 10 years to realize that her breastplate is just body paint. o.O
---
You don't need a combo to reset air, you swap while the 2nd part of your overload is still running. I mean +20% dps is the appeal and judging by the other comments and the builds on various sites, there's a reason why most people think it's the best pick on the build.
---
Yup, it definitely is lore friendly! They would likely follow the Raven spirit, as Raven is associated with death and the afterlife.
---
I agree 100%
---
That has always been the most effective way to play Fresh Air if you want to maximize your damage output and it still also provides all the boons you need. Besides with the survivability you have as  a Tempest I don't see why you would ever run a trait which helps you in downstate but that's probably a difference in play style.
---
I never understood why this community feels so extremly entitled. Like if you have no time to play an MMO, don't play a fucking MMO. Buy the witcher and play it on the easiest setting. Anet bowing to these people just killed the game.
---
Really just goes to show you that you should really take it with a grain of salt, any time a redditor claims soemthing is dead or dying. Like I dunno? Guild Wars 2 or something.
---
I agree, my intention is not to play devils advocate for anet or even support that type of development strategy, just pointing out that it is a widely used method in games with long lifespans.
---
Yes and Black Friday + Wintersday so it could go up to 20k.
---
I don't think there will be any expansion sale in the near future as the bundle of hot with pof is already consider a sale. So you better off just buying the game rather than waiting.
---
imagine jormag arguing with joko, that would be awesome due to their personality
---
I will use it, if they release North/Norn themed armor set next episode
---
Boob shields
---
I always wondered if it was dev oversight (given how rushed certain parts of HotW story and explorable modes feel at times) to not include Garm in the story mode, or if Eir had simply ordered him to stay behind. Given how perceptive Garm is and how well he knows Eir, he should've realized something was wrong with her and maybe tried to accompany the Commander's party to HotW to help Eir snap out of her depression somehow; would've made for a heartwarming moment between the pair.
---
LOL!  Thank you. Need this.
---
&gt; I wasn't overly aggressive, but I was persistent. 
---
Sounds like you're "that person".  No matter if they are a casual or hardcore player, no one wants to be bombarded with "you're doing it wrong" messages.  One "hey, not sure if you knew, but you could be doing a lot more damage if you do X" is fine.  More than one is backseat gaming, which you should strive to avoid.  After all, the point is to have fun, and no one has fun when they're being nagged and harassed all the time.

What is the helmet called?
---
The dungeon story and explorable modes are worth it if you enjoy the world of Tyria and its rich history. While some dungeon paths aren't as intricate storywise as others, plenty of them have lots of cool lore tidbits and worldbuilding like the Flame Legion using the enigmatic Eternal Flame for resurrection in a time where resurrection magic hasn't been witnessed since the gods' full departure, how the heroes encounter the crosscorrupted dragon minion and nigh unkillable Subject Alpha who is able to control rival dragons' minions as a pack alpha, and finding a location in Arah where the Forgotten purified Glint and where we witness a Risen chicken being cleansed of Zhaitan's corruption, among other things. :)
---
It is, but player number and sales wise it objectively does so that's important for ANet.
---
No, it is because HoT angried some people in the short term, but would be beneficial for the game in the long term. And PoF was the opposite. 
---
If a-net got over complaining entitled "casuals" back then (even losing some of them), community would be much healthier, game would have working systems for a vertical skill progression an quite some space to evolve. But instead we have today's cornered state of the game and only now people start to get it. 4 years too late.
---
THIS. I was just there for the LWS3 daily and had forgotten how damn rough those spicy bois are. What is the best strategy for even dealing with them? (Other than fight them on top of a shrine and just keep respawning hah)
---
Yes, and they hired a lot afterwards. Arenanet hasn't yet.
---
Look around you, the only part of the game that looks as alive as two years ago is open world. And even then, if you look at gw2efficiency statistics for achievements and unlocks, they are trending down, which means that either less players play, or that most just stopped caring about completing new achievements.
---
Here are a couple of examples :
---
* [Mastery Achievement per episode](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/unlock-statistics?filter.search=mastery) (sort by "unlocked by players"), 2% have completed it after a week.
---
* [less than 4%](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/unlock-statistics?filter.key=dyes&amp;filter.search=vista) have the new cheapest dye from BLC chests. 1% own the Alpine Dye which is second cheapest at only 4 gold.
---
* After a week, [only 15% of gw2efficiency players](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/unlock-statistics?filter.search=invitation) finished the story of this episode. Even the Prologue which has been out for a couple of months has only been done[ by 22%](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/unlock-statistics?filter.search=race%20arms).
---
* [6%](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/unlock-statistics?filter.search=voice%20claw) have beaten the new Strike Mission. 13% beat the first one in the Prologue.
---
* [Only 10%](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/unlock-statistics?filter.search=supernatural) have beaten the Boneskinner which is the most hyped creature in the episode that everyone was looking forward to.
---
And it gets worse, Guild discords are much less active, guild chats too, most player's friendlists barely show any activity, WvW has more trouble filling squads than ever, PvP matchmaking is a mess of unbalanced matchups because of low pop pairing players from a large spectrum of ranks, stats about raid completion keep going down too, fractal lfg is less crowded, etc...
---
Thanks for the baseless assumption I can't think on my own provided Tempest is my most played class through various game modes and a very large amount of builds.
---
You use at most 2 skills (3 on Fire once at start) every loop outside of Air attunment during the rotation. Even the conjured weapon skills are obviously used when attuned to air to benefit from the extra ferocity. Not to mention the FA Tempest Raid build uses Water and not Fire.
---
Also you cannot judge survivability only by the amount of health of the class. Tempest provides spammable improved protection, huge Vigor uptime, stunbreak and stability on demand and even more with Gale Song. If all of this is not enough, you can run Arcane Shield in Open World and basically never die. Weaver can struggle a bit in Open World especially with sword, but Tempest is a breath.
---
I will put this on different playstyles and move on with it :)
---
You can buy Path of Fire for $20 on DLGamer, which is an authorized dealer.
---
Running away... Me and one other player kept getting wrecked and I’m in all ascended gear. I was running cleanses and heals and still couldn’t keep myself alive.
---
No problem.
---
While I'm pretty sure  that I can see up to five non-air skills in the opening and 2-3 every overload cycle, I don't suggest going on a tangent through the every attument, pressing every button. Just a 2-3 skill  combo in fire is good enough. Might add some blasts from other attunements. And as you have noticed, some of them (most notably long channels like meteor shower or churning earth) will be used in air, filling that gap when overload charges up. Quite basic stuff.
---
While tempest (or anything) won't probably have any difficulty in the latest LW map, it is still *comparatively* fragile spec (out of the builds that make sense, I won't include weaver there) which might cause some problems in harder openworld situations. 
---
And ofc, even if one out of two playstyles is superior, they are still different. And I have already described the most obvious merit of 1 button overload spam one.
---
Go look at threads from 3 years ago. Or click the thread I posted which is from 8 months after release. Plenty of people still talking poorly about Hot then. Lots also defending it. Point is, the negativity was high enough that I felt the need to even make that thread, it was probably the highest it had ever been in the community up until that point.
---
Nowadays that's just Tuesday.
---
&gt; ShB was released in the end of June, 5.1 in the end of October, that's 4 months.
---
Some in span of two months, and then more updates came 2 months after that. So actually two patches with more content than you got in GW2
---
&gt; Low effort recolored corridor.
---
Sure, a dungeon almost the size of a LS map. With bosses that offer actual mechanics to deal with. But feel free to autoattack Tequatl. 
---
&gt;One rehashed boss.
---
Rehashed? Ok I'll pretend to not to argue with this and be okay with. Its still better than any raid in gw2 which is cleared by green and blue armors easily. Except for casuals like yourself though. 
---
&gt;30 mins of barely voiced cutscenes with stock animation.
---
30 minutes? I wont even argue with plain, wrong information. Enjoy the voice acting in gw2 though! Play that RP hard. 
---
&gt;That's less difficult than Strike Missions.
---
Ufff the white knight in you is showing up here. Strike mission done in 2 minutes with autoattacks hammer guards VS a full on raid with actual mechanics. I guess you are one of those people that die to AoE for not knowing what it is? Keep white knighting. 
---
&gt;Wow. /s 
---
Yeah, unbelievable right? Armor gained through playing the game! Its so brilliant. Hope your wallet is doing great with those outfits! 
---
&gt;K.
---
Got tired and couldn't write a proper word? Ran out of things to say? Did you content end? Feels so bad. 
---
And I didn't even talk about Savage raids lmfao. 
---
________
---
Best $60 spent for all the things I was able to play, but you get to spend $60 on build templates and still don't have content to play, awwwwwww. A lot of progression for you I guess!
---
Better go  do the 20 minutes of sitting down meta.
---
I'm not sure you're particularly contradicting what I said, really. Even if casuals don't want lore videos, I still think they don't want raid or minmax build guides.
---
Well I had no problem getting from 300 to 500....
---
Shitte.
---
\^ This is the guy
---
My wife, daughter, and I just started playing again (I played briefly at launch) and we're loving it.
---
I love it. That's so wholesome :) I wish y'all happy adventures
---
Same way  when you lick a frozen pole and your tongue gets stuck
---
I try to avoid interacting with normal T4 players these days if I can help it.  I know what you mean, and I understand and sympathize with that argument.  It's not fun having a backseat driver, and I get that, but... past a point playing support improperly isn't playing support -- it's wasting people's time and baiting their expectations.  T4 Fractals are meant to be difficult, and if communicating with your team is harder than fighting the bosses then you're a ticking time bomb.  I messaged initially, and then nothing changed &gt;&lt; that's the problem and why I just leave if I see glaring cracks in gameplay now.
---
&gt;Those who care for the product the most should be catered to the most
---
Being a tryhard and caring the most aren't the same thing. Plenty of people love the game but just want to have a relaxing time with content for fun, while for others being the best is what they consider fun. Things should be based on where they matter the most. Content should be for the most amount of people where as balance should be based on the most elite players.
---
It does play a factor when, as I mentioned, you center your business around political beliefs, be it right, left, or any other.
---
Plasma Staff works well for my SciFi Daredevil.
---
Pasties. Those are pasties.
---
I wouldn't recommend Ashes of Creation yet. The Lead Producer of the game is quite shifty and development is wonky.
---
&gt;at release and until (i think) two weeks in an Elite Specialization required 400 hero points to train instead of 250
---
I think it might have been less than two weeks and it was changed because people wanted to be able to play through the new content on an elite spec instead of getting it at the the end.
---
They also have no money to spend, and don't contribute to the casual community that does, so why build content for them?
---
Probably the best distinction between casual and hardcore is tolerance for failure/frustration.  A casual might only fail once or twice before complaining or moving on. A hardcore player will bang their head against the wall until it breaks. These types of playstyles are contradictory. Something easy enough for casuals is going to bore the hardcore's and something challenging enough for the hardcore's is going to be frustrating for casuals. A casual doesn't have the the time or want to spend the time to 'git gud'. It is difficult to cater to both.  SWTOR tried it by having various difficulty options on their dungeons and raids but that does not exist in GW2
---
It has everything to do with what my post says, ggg clearly have a love an passion for thier game and want it to be the best it can be and also respect thier community and actively communicate with them about all aspects of the game and address issues the community has as fast as they can to improve the game as a whole. As they've done this poe has exploded in popularity over the past 6 years and continues to gain popularity and get better as a game. The same cannot be said for gw2. Gw2 has only stagnated and is in decline after 7 years with many parts of the game ignored and neglected with little communication about the future of these parts at all. Anet doesn't communicate with us unless there's a significant uproar and they are forced to do something to try and quell the outrage. There is no sense of passion or love for the game like you get from GGG and no sense that they care about the community or making the game as a whole better, all they seem to care about is living story and the gemstore. This has a direct negative impact on the health of the game and it will only continue to decline as it ages if they just want to coast on living story.
---
&gt; Nothing says Braham is unable to take on Wolf Form
---
In the story, yet. But the devs confirmed it on the last Guild Chat.
---
&gt; What caused her being unable to become the bear has conflicting stories, but it wasn't her guilt. Incidentally there's a dialogue that addresses the contradiction:
---
&gt;   Veteran Relief Crew Scout: Some believe the Spirits of the Wild punished her for doing nothing to stop him. Others think Jormag was to blame.
---
&gt; Even if we ignore GW2 dialogue, and just take GW1 dialogue, it's conflicted. Either it was Jormag's influence that prevented it, or Bear revoking the ability.
---
I'm more inclined to believe that Bear revoked it. But Bear revoking it doesn't necessarily mean it wasn't out of emotional distress. Bear is all about strength and will. Her guilt could have been viewed as weakness and unfit for someone blessed by Bear thus making her unworthy until she resolved it by killing Svanir. 
---
Someone wracked with guilt would be unable to kill their sibling to end their suffering. You need strength and willpower to go through with it. So in the end, she redeemed herself in Bear's eyes.
---
That's just my theory.
---
 A GAME THEORY!
---
If they charged for LS releases then I would have left 5 years ago.
---
Sure. I agree that both spvp &amp; wvw were both wrongfully neglected and/or not handled correctly.
---
The initial splash was big, but that was a one time thing. If you factor in that they barely made any money for 5-6 years because they gave up working on GW1 to make GW2, even that's not all that impressive anymore.
---
These days Anet's profit is comparable to the era of GW:Nightfall, and that was with a much smaller crew, cheaper servers, and no cosmetics being sold on the store.
---
We don't know how much profit GW1 could've made had Anet started releasing outfits *before* bailing on the game. 
---
Truth is they haven't made more money on GW1 because they weren't greedy back then, and didn't care to try in general.
---
Core GW2 is also F2P which heavily skews account numbers. I could see GW2 selling more copies than GW1, but I don't think the numbers are drastically higher.
---
My personal opinion: it was great with hot, the professions felt important, it was something special... then it started: the nerfs from elite specs.... and core specs... ( some nerfs just before pof, ppl said they wanted to make the new elize specs stand out by ruining the core and hot specs...), also the condis got stronger, they made them shorter, but harder hitting clearing them seems impossible with monsters that hand them out like candy... ( looking at big mob groups in hot and pof with 2 or 3 elites)... my personal ouch that hurts was the change of phantasms... i just play pve and the argument was they wanted that mesmers ( i just play mesmer, since 5 years, tried to find other classes... but i must admit: i am mesmer main)... now everyone just shatters because clones are useless, tank and dmg from them are a joke  i liked to have a phantasm out.... and rarely used shatter, now my survivability is like, shatter, shatter... i dont really like it.... now they made living  clones a must have on chrono... without clones chrono cant use shatters... and guess what? Our condi clean is based on shatter... i as a pve player read the forums and the pvp section is just like: nerf class x it is too strong, nerf class y i die too fast... and guess what? The classed get nerfed... in BOTH MODES... now i have trouble surviving in pve... i feel weak.... not like someone who slayed dragons ( with help).     It does not feel good and for the time being... i took a break.... at least in pve i dont want to feel like a " match in a wet and dark cellar"... not with max lvl and ascended armor / weapons, Accessoires... that is just my personal opinion, i like the story, the elite specs, the landscape and the mounts ( still some more hairstyles and cultural outfits like cooks and wedding would be nice, to much human in mind designed armor)...
---
 Whether its a blessing or not will only become obvious when we know who the new CEO is, I don't think Mike Z is CEO.
---
Appreciate the links!    
---
I do have one warrior that I've been playing, and it's not bad...reminds me a little of a Retribution Pally from WoW, which was one of my mains. I am just plain ol' enjoying the ranged in this game better thus far though. Digging anything where I can more or less kite mobs into traps/AoEs while I roll out of the way and shoot the bejeesus out of them.
---
I don't think there will be one. Anet is now probably fully owned by NCSoft.
---
See thing is. Before you paid for the expansion and the living story was delayed content. Although its "free" its gated behind the expansion. 
---
Now we have the saga thing. The content for that will probably be funded by the "expansion type releases " 
---
Those features will most likely be given for free at a basic level with a gem cost for expansion of said features. Bit like how build templates were done.
---
If this is the case why cant they just be upfront about it. And lay out some kind of structure for it. So we know what is due "roughly" and what the cost is. 
---
They kept the whole build templare cost a secrecy for reason I don't know....
---
If you want to have a character to hit events the World Boss Portal Device is more useful...and it drops you at a WP which then unlocks. The only real use I can see this for is a bit of a head start of World Completion.
---
Edgy comment
---
Not true. Anet earned pre HoT in normal quarters ~20+ bn won and after HoT release quarter just 15. They lost 25% of their quarterly income with HoT.
---
The short spike of HoT in the two release quarters were just +17 and +10 bn won compared to normal quarters pre release. That's roughly 23 million Anet earned with HoT if you exclude the losses in the later quarters. While this seems to be a lot, you have to keep in mind that developing HoT wasn't free. With two years developing time this roughly pay a team of 100 devs. Not 400.
---
PoF on the other hand increased longterm quarter results. PoF was a success. HoT wasn't.
---
ESO announces its plans well in advance, the whole 2020 year of development was announced in January and they've stuck to their plan.
---
But... But... "It's on the table"© Anet
---
they made diablo2 but different. that's literally it.
---
Ranged DPS isnt really a thing in GW2. However, coming from a similar background, I can understand your "reluctance" towards Melee DPS. However, I want to point out that GW2 has a combat system very much more geared towards action combat than classic mmo tab targeting. That makes melee combat a lot easier.
---
That being said, for PvE endcontent Id suggest looking at [https://www.youtube.com/user/TurboDzan/videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/TurboDzan/videos) for Nike's Open World videos. 
---
For raidbuilds -&gt; [https://snowcrows.com/](https://snowcrows.com/)
---
For fractalbuilds -&gt; [https://discretize.eu/](https://discretize.eu/)
---
Every fractal/raid build also works for openworld, you can / should change skills and traits if you are dieing too much. Things like lifesteal trait in critical strikes on thief for example makes way more of a difference than going for more tanky gear.
---
I think necro (reaper) might be a good choice for you. Or guardian (firebrand). Or thief for being able to stealth past mobs.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Choice_of_the_Dragonrender
---
I recommend doing the PvP or WvW reward track for it if the helm is all you care about. Collection itself is more time or gold consuming than reward tracks
---
mobile games seem more their speed tbh
---
The only thing keeping GW2 alive is that living wor----sorry *sagas* are free.
---
You change that, the game dies.
---
Considering that the Aberrations, Fallen and Svanir in Bjorra are infused with the power of those spirits, I'm under the assumption that they were either consumed or corrupted by Jormag. There are shrines dedicated to those spirits around the map, and unlike normal dormant shrines they have a sort of shadowy smoke coming out of them.
---
~~Gods damnit~~.  
---
Spirits be praised.
---
Doubtful.  I'm pretty sure PoE has a bigger fanbase than Torchlight, which speaks to the fact that PoE's success isn't simply due to being a Diablo 2 clone.
---
Actually it may be because exactly after his departure, the game took a strange direction. He even communicated on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/ArenaColin/ It looks so simple. Good leader leaves and then game starts to die.
---
&gt;but... past a point playing support improperly isn't playing support -- it's wasting people's time and baiting their expectations 
---
Sounds like you get it but you're frustrated.  And I totally get that feeling.  You expect everyone to be awesome because they're at a level where they should be able to clear T4 fractals.  In an ideal world, that's the case.  But not everyone has the same level of commitment to the game.
---
What exactly is your expectation for a PUG?  Because I think your expectation is way higher than it should be.   
---
 There's a reason those people are in PUGs and not a static group.  That reason could be anything from attitude to skill to time commitment.  That's not meant to excuse dragging a team down, but more the reality of the situation.
---
&gt;if communicating with your team is harder than fighting the bosses then you're a ticking time bomb. I messaged initially, and then nothing changed &gt;&lt; that's the problem
---
It sounds more like you're the ticking time bomb here.  The expectation that someone will just listen to you and change how they're playing is ludicrous.  Look at it from another perspective.  If someone you didn't know sent you a message telling you how you're doing horrible and you should do X Y Z instead, how would you react?  Everyone likes to think that they'd take the information as helpful and attempt to use it.  That's a 1 in a hundred scenario, though.  I've had that happen to me in other MMOs.  Between not having the macros or skill bar set up appropriately to do the new strategy, not wanting to stop fighting just to learn how to do something new on the spot, and not knowing who the other person is and what their experience is, there's no real reason to change mid-instance.  Just because they aren't playing the way you want to doesn't mean they're playing *wrong*, which is how backseat gaming messages come across, no matter what your intent.
---
it's silly to apply such real life restrictions when you are talking about a race that can shapeshift into animal form in a world where magic is the norm
---
That player sound like an elitist casual. What a paradox.
---
&gt;No ongoing game can be sustained off of just casuals or just hardcore players. Look at 2 ends of the spectrum: Wild Star and Club Penguin. For an online game that wants to continue to exist for a decade you NEED both groups to keep the game afloat
---
The failure of those two games doesn't have to have anything to do with their demographics though, or even be related at all. I'm pretty sure both of those games didn't have any tentacle hentai in them either, but that doesn't mean I can conclude that tentacle hentai is essential to a game's survival.
---
What matters is if the game can continue to engage it's core demographic, and hardcore players aren't magically necessary for that.
---
Extra storage is nice.
---
But all my extra character slots become indentured Lumberjacks and Flax slaves.  Maybe one day,  if they are really good, they may earn a trip to a makeover salon and be allowed to roll in my treasure vault of transmutation stones.  But until that day, its endless chopping and digging.
---
Now excuse me while i eat this Birthday Booster cake and pour this dye from my 2016 black friady sale slave all over my main.
---
Arguably PoF was a better received expansion than HoT. People loved mounts, and since that time there was plenty of positive feedback from releases. 
---
HoT arguably, cost the game a lot of casual players and the playerbase went down. People say the game is dying now, which is ridiculous, because we've had quarters doing the same business now as we did in the aftermath of HoT.  
---
I personally loved HoT, even when people were hating on it, but time went on and some stuff in HoT was fixed. PoF was released as the anti hot for a reason. Generally less confusing zones, easier to get masteries, easier hero points (at least none of the really hard ones) and instead of big metas on timers that were very rewarding we got bounties which were content on demand.
---
What happened to Anet since HoT. They tried to learn from their mistakes and made an expansion that was better in some ways and worse in others, particularly because they overreacted to the outcry over HoT.
---
That Braham part... *Ohmygods.*
---
I would pay for it if they could release an entire season worth of content every 3/4 months, but as it is now it's probably for the best that it's free because the game would be dunked into the garbage bin so fast otherwise.
---
no, it really doesn't. it goes to show you that the people who said anything about classic wow dying or being a fad were wrong, it has no implications for other mmos in this case.
---
Thanks for this lovely topic! Lore is always fun to discuss. :)
---
I'm going to list both mysteries and plot points I'd love to see addressed in The Icebrood Saga even though I imagine we won't necessarily witness most of these:
---
**1) The Sanguinary Blade**
---
Aka Dragon's Blood blade), it's made from Jormag's frozen blood and is currently held in the Priory after Sieran and a certain lively Novice retrieved it from the Sons of Svanir. Given how we see one of the whispers-influenced Suspicious Travelers standing near the asura gates at the Priory, I hope that Jormag will make a move to secure this artifact.
---
Just like we've seen Zhaitan, Mordremoth and Kralkatorrik being weak to their particular strengths, I could imagine the Sanguinary Blade being to Jormag what the Dragonsblood Spear(s) was to Kralkatorrik, and it would serve Jormag's interests to eliminate it from the board or alternatively hand it over to the Dragon's newest champion to spread icy corruption at a faster pace given the sword's terrifying corruptive properties from the Priory storyline. Even if Braham/Eir's bow was destroyed and we failed to acquire more jotun scrolls to enchant weapons with fire, this blade could still be a potentially powerful weapon against Jormag as long as we keep its corruptive power in check. I'd also love to learn more about its dwarven history and how it ended in the hands of the Stone Summit.
---
**2) More minor Spirits of the Wild coming to our aid, and their mysteries**
---
While there's a high likelihood we get more lore on the three lost Spirits of the Wild (Dolyak, Eagle and Wolverine) after the teases in the essence manipulation mastery, I'd also like the story to address other minor Spirits such as Frog, Gorilla, Hare, Mink, Minotaur, Otter, and Wurm who each could offer us some aid if the writers found a natural way to weave them into the saga.
---
Just imagine us being ambushed by villains in a seemingly hopeless situation only to suddenly see the disrespected Hare come to our aid with her army of cute jackalopes whose powerful kicks would send the villains flying to kingdom come (just think of the power of the rabbit boss in Uncategorized Fractal or the crazed jackalope in Thunderhead Peaks for reference). I'd both laugh and cheer if many of these minor Spirits whom norn may view as a joke at times actually turned out to be pint-sized powerhouses and true badasses, teaching the norn (and Jormag) the lesson to not judge a book by its cover.
---
I'd also like to learn if Jormag is supposed to truly be the Dragon Spirit (aka the embodiment of all dragons) as Sons of Svanir and some other norn believe, if Jormag devoured the original Dragon Spirit in the past which may have caused the current dragons' downfall into greed and whatnot, or if the true Dragon Spirit exists somewhere out there and may be what Jormag is really after to take ultimate power for itself. We know from Owl's lore that all owls became weaker and more confused when their Spirit was killed, so the same should hold true to this hypothetical Dragon Spirit and its connection to Tyria's many greater and lesser dragons should Jormag reach it. Maybe the idea could be that Jormag alone gains Dragon's power and wisdom from consuming it while all its other Elder Dragon rivals (including Aurene) are weakened after the Spirit's destruction, which would be a chilling plan indeed.
---
I also hope we learn more about Owl. While her fate is tragic, I always found one tidbit in her lore very curious. If we interact with the Owl shrine at Lost Spirits' Hallow, we get this particular bit of text: "What comes next is an assault on the senses. A flurry of feathers, a scream into the maw of oblivion, a creeping coldness. **But one sensation towers over them all—hope.**"
---
What exactly is this hope that Owl's last moments seem to hint at? Some of her shamans believe that they can resurrect her somehow, so are the Spirits replaceable if we find the means to do so? We already learn from Bjora Marches essence manipulation that the Spirits embody specific traits and virtues (e.g. Resilience, Valor, Vigilance) so maybe those spirit essences can be infused with spiritual beings in great enough numbers to potentially turn them into the fallen Spirits' successors if we followed the successor analogy for the Six Human Gods via Grenth, Kormir and whoever Balthazar's replacement is?
---
**3) The Whitebear Saga**
---
As I've [written before at length](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d3ring/lore_the_whitebear_saga/), I'd love to see lots of involvement from the Whitebear family (Knut, Skarti, Sigfast and the so far unseen Gaerta) in the saga, especially now that we got a shocking reveal about the past of Knut's grandfather Asgeir Dragonrender that is sure to cause some discussion among the Whitebears once/if they learn about Asgeir's burden. Will Sigfast's ambitions become his undoing should Jormag's whispers reach him? Will the prophecy about Knut's potential death, alluded to in an old fireside song, be fulfilled, or are we going to witness a twist? Will Knut's wife Gaerta Whitebear, the Enchantress and Bane of Lies who is currently somewhere up north to build her legend, make an appearance and become a badass heroine who takes on Drakkar or other foes?
---
**4) Lore on other northern races beyond norn and kodan**
---
While the announcement trailer mainly focused on norn and kodan stuff, I'd love to see the saga also touch on the lore of the jotun, grawl and quaggan who each have a bone to pick with Jormag for their own reasons.
---
We could discover a shielded paradise valley within the mountains (like Shangri-La) and maybe even discover a small tribe of pre-fall angelic(?) jotun who could provide us with ancient wisdom and help us interpret the stars, especially as Jormag and the Fraenir both referred to stars in the recent episode. What exactly is the Elder Dragons' relation to the birth of stars, and what other Mists ties will we discover? Will we find more ancient jotun scrolls like the ones used by Asgeir and Braham so we can enchant more weapons with them to stand a chance against Jormag?
---
While most of our focus has been on the southern quaggan whose kingdom was destroyed by the invasive krait, we also know that their northern cousins likewise had to flee although their exodus came because of Jormag. Baroosh and Shashoo could help us uncover the fate of the markissios (the royal family, if the northern quaggans had one) and maybe discover all the fallen quaggan having become terrifying berserker Icebrood. The story hasn't touched on the quaggan's berserk mode that much since personal story, so seeing more enraged quaggans now serving Jormag would truly be a chilling turn in the story and make them a credible enemy to fight while Baroosh and Shashoo get to be badasses like they were during HoT.
---
I'd like to see Gara, the grawl shaman we help in personal story, return with his tribe and help us fight against the Dragon who has been trying to corrupt grawl via the Sons of Svanir for a while now. Instead of playing the grawl as comic relief, I'd love to see some insightful dialogue from this clever shaman and how he may have some knowledge that can help us in our quest. Bonus points if via Gara we also learn more about the troubled history between grawl and charr and how grawl were in Ascalon first before charr so technically they'd have the true claim to it if push came to shove. Could lead to some interesting ambient chatter between charr (who used to have grawl as slaves pulling their chariots) and grawl as the two bickering races have to work together against a greater enemy.

**5) Charr politics**
---
One of the cool plot points in the prologue was the uncertainty surrounding the ambitions of the imperators. Smodur, who I'd give my charr's left paw for, is shown to be just as ambitious as Bangar but playing the political game in an even more subtle manner as an opportunist, which Malice warns us about. What exactly will Smodur's endgame entail, and will we have to fight against him or otherwise cripple these plans should his ambitions threaten our goals at some point? While Malice and Efram have so far been painted as the most moral imperators of the four, I hope we get to see a darker side of both of them; Efram certainly has a chance to become a tragic antivillain if he feels his family is being threatened and he has no choice but to betray us for the sake of his people if he was forced to make a choice. Malice, while being the most important supporter of the treaty, could likewise seem benevolent at first but is revealed as scheming to install a puppet ruler for the charr with herself ruling from the shadows as a "grey eminence" of sorts, so we may have to foil her potential ambitions as well.
---
The sleeper agent and spy plot among the charr has potential too, and I hope the writers won't botch it like what happened with the White Mantle sleeper agent subplot during Season 3. Back then I was thrilled to imagine that any of the humans I had worked with in personal story could've been a Mantle supporter all along, but those spies were mostly dealt with off screen. If the writers play their cards right, we could see some truly shocking reveals on the charr side as Bangar and the Renegades' supporters slowly start revealing themselves.
---
One such candidate is the ambitious but so far unseen Iron Legion Tribune Fume Brighteye who openly opposes the treaty (even if she has to dance to Smodur's tune for now) because of her father's tragic backstory with humans, and she is bucking to become the next imperator. I'd love to see Bangar and Fume scheming so that Fume can arrange an "accident" to get rid of Smodur (or at least incapacitate him) so she can take over as the new Iron Imperator as she already has lots of supporters in the legion. Fume could initially be revealed as our ally until we learn her true colors later on and have to stop her and Bangar's ambitions.
---
With the rise of Efram's Flame Legion splinter faction, I'd love to see the saga address the rest of the Flame Legion factions as well. What's going on with the excommunicated Molten alliance whose leaders are still somewhere out there? What about the Godforged extremists of the late Gaheron Baelfire, or the survivors of the zealous shaman caste after Hierophant Improaster's demise? Devs mentioned how they'd like to explore Crecia's story more, and we know her sire was a high-ranking shaman, so is it possible we might encounter Crecia's (potentially evil) sire leading one of the Flame splinter groups? The Flame Legion would no doubt oppose Efram's aspirations to become the de facto Flame Imperator, and it'd be fun to see the remaining Flame tribunes compete for the vacant throne.
---
I'd also love to see the rest of Rytlock and Crecia's Stone Warband as well as reunite with my old warbandmate and the rest of the warband I left behind since personal story's early chapters. With the phasing tech they're now using for allied combat NPCs, we could even theoretically have our warbandmate phased in future content based on our choices during personal story so those who saved Dinky, Reeva etc. can have their share of fun with their chosen friend.
---
**6) Human politics and Foefire ghosts**
---
One of the curious lore tidbits was that not only Renegades but Separatists were getting bolder lately. While Renegade rebirth can be traced back to Bangar likely pulling the strings, the Separatist resurgence is fascinating as I thought they'd been more or less crippled after their funding was cut due to Caudecus and White Mantle's fall and their lost Captain DeLana during Caudecus Manor dungeon. Who exactly is stirring the Separatists into action, and will we discover their latest leader? Are Kasmeer, Logan, Jennah etc. going to play into this part of the plot, and will it lure out E too as the rising charr and human tensions (and Bangar's ambitions for Jormag) should draw that elusive spymaster's attention?
---
This would also be the perfect opportunity to return to King Adelbern and the Foefire ghosts. Tom Abernathy stated on forums that Aurene couldn't take in all of Balthazar and Kralkatorrik magic, so some of it leaked into the environment, boosting the powers of the remaining Elder Dragons and other entities (as seen with those ley-infused Branded and Icebrood in the saga so far). Logic follows, then, that some of that magic would've hit the Foefire ghosts on the way north, which means Adelbern should have a notable power boost and could become a serious threat with these added powers and his strategic cunning. I'd love to see Adelbern be a villain at first but we could eventually redeem him and Barradin with the help of their ghostly children Rurik and Althea, and cleanse the Foefire madness from the ghosts with help from the ritual, the two blades and the crown, as well as the presence of the Heir of Ascalon. Imagine if we managed to convince the cleansed Adelbern and Barradin to see the bigger threat, and, after some deliberation, we'd see a redemptive moment where the two tragic villains and charr haters sacrifice themselves to save the charr of the Black Citadel (and the humans of Ebonhawke) from Jormag or Bangar's threat, leaving Rurik and Althea to lead the remaining Foefire ghosts to a peaceful afterlife in a happy ending for all these tragic victims of the Foefire.
---
The Heir of Ascalon and the Krytan royal locket (which would lead us to the heir, which both Priory and Order of Whispers have alluded to) plotlines would naturally tie into the Foefire ghost plot, especially once Magdaer returned to the spotlight in the hands of Logan as Eir had intended so long ago. We could see a twist in the prophecy for the cleansing which might require the following: Logan wielding Sohothin (representing Ascalon's human past), Rytlock wielding Sohothin (Ascalon's charr present), and the Heir wielding King Adelbern's crown (Ascalon's united future with true peace between charr and humans) in a symbolic triumvirate to succeed where Rytlock had initially failed. The Heir could even rally the remaining Separatists behind them, turning them into resurgent Royalists (to mirror the Royalist faction from pre-Searing Ascalon that once supported Barradin over Adelbern) while Jennah allows true autonomy to Ascalon so the locals can start viewing Krytans in a better light and end the animosity between the two once rival human nations with the Heir leading the new Ascalon into a prosperous future with charr by their side as old hatres are slowly forgotten to face a greater threat in Jormag.
---
Maybe we'd even see a culmination of Jennah and Logan's romance at long last, and give them what they deserve. While devs seem to wish Logan and Jennah to go their separate ways, we have proof from "A Queen's Justice" story instance in the Kellach arc that Jennah does care for Logan a lot but wants him to become an independent man and hero first so he can truly be seen as her equal before they can be together. Logan's role in the Pact and helping to end the threats of Bangar/Jormag, Separatists, and cleanse the Foefire and bring forth the Heir should be suitable enough heroic feats to end his and Jennah's tale on a happy note.
---
**7) Centaur War**
---
There's some fascinating throwaway ambient dialogue in Core Tyria about a potential alliance between Flame Legion and centaurs which we never get to witness in game (so far). Wouldn't it be cool if we tied Woodland Cascades content to the Renegades reaching out to the Modniir High Command (or even the new War King if such has arisen since Ulgoth's death) to strengthen charr forces? As both centaurs and Bangar's extremists hate humans, this alliance would be natural and horrifying, especially with ley energy and Jormag's corruption being around.
---
We could finally travel to the centaur homelands and find a way to end the Centaur War once and for all by taking out the oppressive Modniir overlords and their Harathi and Tamini sycophants. We could aid rebellious centaurs from all three tribes to overthrow the military dictatorship, and we could get to play with centaur foals and come to sympathize with them. I could imagine good charr and sylvari trying to reach out to centaurs as negotiators between them and humans: charr could offer sage advice to the rebels on the benefits of a peace between two former rival races, while earth-attuned centaurs would naturally respect sylvari as nature spirits and have some spiritual and lovely conversations with them.
---
wow this looks insanely good
---
**8) Krait lore**
---
Curiously the Icebrood Saga announcement trailer showed us krait bodies among the norn in the aftermath of a naval battle. Does this mean we might get to explore some krait lore too? I'd love to learn more about the krait's Oratuss priest caste and discover if the krait possibly have an empress leading them deep in the depths. We could learn more about the krait's abyssal prophets who the krait believe will return to flood the world so krait will rule supreme. This could be our first tease at Bubbles too since that dragon has no doubt been feasting on some krait obelisks in the Unending Ocean. I could imagine the krait empress (or high priests) being terrifying villains if they were given enough screentime and we have to outmaneuver their armies and magic to get to our objective. I'd love to meet some potentially redeemable krait and save them from indoctrination if possible to prove that even a seemingly "black hat" race has a chance to atone and do good if given the chance.
---
**9) Inquest plans, and Overseer Kuda's potential return**
---
We've seen an Inquest member named Researcher Dwidd discussing the option of weaponizing Aurene's magic with a charr farmer in Grothmar Valley. In Season 4 we met Overseer Kuda, heavily implied to be Kudu's daughter, continuing her father's work and enslaving crosscorrupted dragon minions such as Subject Beta. I wonder how Inquest might feature into the saga as their ambitions to control the Elder Dragons' minions and the dragons themselves could lead to a catastrophe if, say, the unseen leader of the Inquest managed to enslave Jormag and/or Aurene with tech derived from Arah's mursaat path, and Snaff and Kudu's research. Will Overseer Kuda be a plot hook for Zojja's return, as I can't imagine Zojja wanting to be idle if she learns that the daughter of her archenemy is about to succeed in finishing Kudu's work.
---
**10) Gods' manipulations**
---
While all the mayhem is going on, I'd love the saga to address at least two unresolved god plots from Path of Fire: the schemes of Lyssa and the fate of Balthazar's evil half-brother Menzies. Devs suggested that there's more to Balthazar's story we've yet to see, and it was significant why he didn't curse Lyssa in his final moments. Likewise, Peter Fries mentioned that there were initially more references to Menzies in PoF before most of those were removed in the rewrites. What exactly is Lyssa after, why did she antagonize Kormir, and what is the relationship between her and Balthazar?
---
As for Menzies, his story could be resolved in a raid or potentially in living world depending on the writers' ambition. Menzies has a reason to hate both the Commander and Aurene who killed his half-brother before he had the chance to. As seen how Menzies's Shadow Army assaulted the Pact on Dragonfall because they sensed part of Balthazar's essence in Aurene, Menzies could use a similar curse-bound hatred to plan the downfall of both Aurene and the Commander so he can take their power and then go hunt Balthazar's potential successor among the Six in the Mists. Menzies could initially appear as a seemingly benevolent mortal or even a ghost whom we learn to trust, but he eventually backstabs us and reveals his true form in the worst possible moment to have his revenge. It would be a chilling plot as Menzies is known as being both destructive and deceptive.
---
These are just some of the ideas that come to mind. I'm sure ANet will take us in interesting directions, but I hope they give the norn, charr and their associated cultures and racial allies/enemies their spot in the limelight. I look forward to finding out what happens next, and I hold out hope that the saga is allowed to have more episodes than previous seasons given its potentially ambitious scope. :)
---
Sheer force of STYLE!
---
Yeah but if you get a friend to play GW2 or any other game with you tomorrow they are probably going to want to play WITH you and that usually means current content. Lots of people will skip HoT and PoF stories when picking up GW2 this year, and then work their way backwards to getting them.
---
Jormag probably thinks that it'd be doing everyone a favour by icebrooding them.
---
Dude, I wouldn't pay for those crap episodes a single penny. B2P + mtx is the only business model to sustain this corspe of a game.
---
They made a great arpg that they show a lot of passion for and actively improved the game in no small part by communicating and listening to thier community which has led to the growth its had over the years. This is something that anet does not do which is unfortunately to the detriment of gw2 as seen by the constant state of decline it is in.
---
I'm talking character slots versus bank contract.
---
Really? I think you have it backwards. Mammals are warm blooded, this means they have a natural body heat that some other animals, *especially* cold blooded reptiles, don't have. Reptiles living in cold areas make no sense unless unusual biology is involved.
---
But norn aren't just a warm blooded race. They're a warm blooded **furless** race living in the coldest climates. There's only three possible explanations for why they could survive there:
---
1. Magic. Which is the BS boring answer.
---
2. Body fat. Like seals, they lack fur, but they have high body fat to insulate them and keep them warm. However, norn are very fit, with muscles showing through the skin - so this cannot be the case.
---
3. High body temperature, that keeps them generating heat allowing them to sustain themselves in cold climates, but not hot.
---
What's really dumb is that ArenaNet never really bothered to add in how norn should have issues traversing the highly humid Maguuma or the arid Crystal Desert and Elona.
---
I love what she's ALMOST wearing =D
---
Well I never hit on raid or minmaxing was more focused towards the Lore side. Like I said before, most just want to casually enjoy the game and farm. Never said anything about minmaxing or raiding.
---
I just think many are oblivious to the Lore of the game, which is why they keep calling back to the name Guild Wars involving WvW when it was an event before the first game began.
---
I mean they enjoy some parts of the story that suit them, just never really met any casual player that went out of their way to really look deep into the story otherwise they are no longer casual, they are lore nerds like myself.
---
&gt; I'm more inclined to believe that Bear revoked it. But Bear revoking it doesn't necessarily mean it wasn't out of emotional distress. Bear is all about strength and will. Her guilt could have been viewed as weakness and unfit for someone blessed by Bear thus making her unworthy until she resolved it by killing Svanir. 
---
If Bear revoked Jora's ability because of guilt, then it wouldn't make sense for her to regain it upon killing her brother, but rather upon clearing her family name which Bear wanted her to do following Svanir's death.
---
&gt; Someone wracked with guilt would be unable to kill their sibling to end their suffering. You need strength and willpower to go through with it. So in the end, she redeemed herself in Bear's eyes.
---
You can kill out of grief and guilt.
---
What were you doing 20 years ago?
---
Burned all my ingots and did the same thing. 3g to craft sold for 30, sold eight of those like hot cakes.
---
Take note ANET! This is how to tell a narrative!
---
Imagine if this actually happened, such creepy powermove would guaranty Jormags victory.
---
Yeah, I suppose. It kinda is.
---
I guess it's just because I wasn't expecting that to be the real reason and was kind of disappointed.
---
Now when you are mentioning the engine... I started playing Warframe week ago and before that on my laptop (Lenovo legion y520) i had just GW2... And I've been amazed that game looking so good and game that is fast fast action/shooter rpg is working soo good on my machine. On high settings. GW2 is overheating my laptop (on medium settings) while WF is working like Windows pinball game...
---
I dont known nothing about game engines, but i can feel the difference. Literally physically!
---
I personally don't mind if it's shorter than usual, as long as we get more stuff. My only disapointment is the lack of content in general. And I don't mean hardcore modes, PvP or WvW. 
---
They advertised the Saga as a replacement for expansions and the first episode was really lackluster in terms of precisely that. If we're going to get all of that expansion worthy stuff in the span of a year or more, well, that doesn't bold very well for the game. 
---
It never will for any game.
---
And even so, I'm worried as to what they call "expansion" content when they don't even talk about anything or e-specs.
---
Those 2 guys in the background represent WvW and PvP
---
I take a longer term view of all of it. It's like people think every episode is going to be equal. We're also supposed to be getting episodes more frequently. If they're coming out every two months with some sort of festival in between, the content amount is fine. I mean there are people who like hours and hours a day. They're never really going to be satisfied with the amount of content anyway.
---
But I was actually feeling a bit of stress from all the stuff to do in Grothmar, considering I do content on multiple characters. This was a much needed break for me, particularly with Wintersday coming.  And I still have a couple of things I haven't finished in the zone yet.
---
  
---
More to that, I like the way the zone is laid out. There's always events going on. I'm never waiting for something to do. I'm just experiencing the zone.  When people say there's nothing to do they mean obviously aside from dynamic events, I guess.
---
I'm still farming to finish the second weapon set.
---
[( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)](http://puu.sh/EIFbn/4ad5095fb0.png)
---
Still better than Caithe.
---
&gt; Everything works in bad pugs
---
That's kinda my point, I get easy clears that doesn't take much time even having a healer (specially having a healer), and if it's clearing the content I don't consider it a bad pug.
---
Gonna use it on alt accounts in Kryta or the Shiverpeaks so they can finally do weekly guild treks for easy coin and guild commendations
---
I joined a commanderless training raid back around when Wing 4 came out and ended up having to take charge to get us through Cairn. At MO, we were having issues with DPS. Now, if we were having trouble at MO, there clearly wasn't one single person who was *the* problem, but one of the necromancers had less damage than the healers. I whispered him offering to help improve his build/rotation/etc and asked what gear he was using. He linked a bunch of Rare/Masterwork items with random stats and runes. I was fully willing to work with him on fixing his build, swapping his utilities, and improving his rotation. I would probably have been fine if his gear was all somewhat useful stats, even if it was Rare/Masterwork stuff. But at that point, I just told him that he wasn't ready for raids as he was, and offered to link him guides on builds and gear. He cursed me out, left the raid, and blocked me. Then, every day for a couple weeks, he'd randomly unblock me at some point to rage at me, then block me again.
---
In this case, it was in a training raid, so I was quite lenient with my requirements of teammates. However, that player was just dead weight and unwilling to fix the problem. I felt that my restrictions were *VERY* low, since it was a training raid. The bar for T4 FotM is going to be higher. Not wanting someone to miss 90% of their wells seems like a reasonable bar to me.
---
There's no clear cut line on where that bar should be, but there is a point at which it's reasonable for someone to raise an issue with someone's play in the more difficult content.
---
TL;DR - Respecting your teammates goes both ways. At some point, you're not just trying to have fun, you're actively wasting other people's time and making their experience less fun because of your own laziness.
---
Any time I start an MMO, I try out a ton of different classes so I can get a general idea of how I like each playstyle, then I narrow down from there and ultimately delete any char's I just don't use, or don't enjoy using that much.   
---
What I'm doing now is playing one class per night in my free time for several hours to see how the playstyle goes, and what the storyline looks like. I just noted that I have invested more time/energy into the ranged ones than my melee ones, so based upon that it just seems like the more natural way to go for me.   
---
I do like the idea of a thief I don't have to bother stealthing with though - so I'll give that a shot too at some point.
---
And they shouldn't stopping with esports in pvp.
---
That's kind of my point. The episodes are crap because they're giveaways. If they made amazing episodes and charged for them the game would be so much better off. Instead all the resources go to the cash shop because that's where the money is. It's a vicious cycle.
