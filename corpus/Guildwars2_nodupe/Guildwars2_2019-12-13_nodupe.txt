&gt; All in getting from this is eso looks better
---

---
&gt;Which is a fucking lie eso looks like ps2 graphics. Gw2 isn't much better but at least it's honest
---
It does though.  ESO also runs a ton better than GW2 with very infrequent hiccups here and there.  It's consistently better at running events with multiple people, npc/enemy load priority, and target priority.  ESO has a lot wrong with it, but when it comes to graphical fidelity, it has GW2 beat by miles.
---
---
---
Why have we done this?
---
I think the point is that gw copied the eso atronack design
---
Guardian is always fun because it's always great. WvW, Pve Fractals. There hasn't been a time I've been playing, when guardian wasn't one of the best choices.
---
Two good elite specs, core is viable, lots of different ways to play. All the weapons are fun(..maybe not longbow).
---
firebrand is currently the best support for PvE and PvP (just for some of the raid bosses, he just not the perfect meta pic, but is still good with renegade).
---
You don't have to play him as heal, esp. in fractal he is played as semi dps.
---
This is standard now.
---
Awesome showcase of what this game has to offer
---
Tons of guilds are active and recruiting. How long did you look?
---
My personal favorite is Norn level 20 story "got drunk and passed out at the moot"
---
**Storywise:** It's generally pretty good because it is condensed to a small area (2 maps basically) and one main story-thread. If you prefer the haphazard kind of story that gets you exploring many places then you'd like season 3 more, but season 2 is definitely more coherent and builds into HoT well. In a way this makes it more "boring" I guess but you won't experience as many "wtf is going on" moments as most other storylines. 
---
**Loot:** There are some good drops from story missions but nothing incredible. You definitely get a lot of achievements from it but you may find some challenging to do as most people interested in them have done them and you'd have to tackle them alone. That being said, the achievements were also developed prior to having elite specializations, so for all I know they could all be a cakewalk now.
---
To be honest since it's in the Mists they should just make the lobby like this.
---
I personally didn’t look long as I don’t know where to look for them tbh.. I know my friend didn’t either. He joined some random guild that wasn’t active and just ended up quitting.
---
Update:  [https://imgur.com/a/WWw0ZP7](https://imgur.com/a/WWw0ZP7)
---
Yeah I agree with you I think I just worded it poorly.
---
Eso is better but it's not great either
---

https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/categories/looking-for-guild
---
If you're trying to find a guild use these or talk to people in-game about their guild
---
Just go to Lion's Arch and ask in Map Chat during the day, or you could go to a guild recruitment subreddit. I forget the name, but you should be able to find it by googling that.
---
Bah, figured it out. When I first logged back into the game I opened an outfit and put it on. Had been wearing it ever since and not seen how to turn it off, have now unchecked it in outfits.
---
Jews: you mean 3 millenia older?
---
Take your fucking upvote and get out.
---
Oof. I'm sorry
---
Lol what a rip off
---
Wow, this is awesome. Ice- themed elite specializations would be really cool and original. I really hope Arenanet makes new elite specializations...
---
Sadly that also takes away from the charm of some maps :(
---
I mean I can attempt, but I’m pretty sure their minds are made up
---
I disagree with part of that -  The first couple of weeks during a WoW expansion can net you at the very least minimum wage with mat farmin and consumable.
---
Then if you factor in things like dungeon running or selling raid mounts / runs that can be fairly easy to make minimum wage as well, but isn't really farming.
---
Wiki says nothing special about the fraenir...

Banner slave revolt!
---
Chronomancer (Sword + Sword / Focus) [Power DPS] 
---
* Lots and lots of clones
---
* Can solo most fractals
---
* Breaks defiance bars easily
---
* Able to send in phantasms to fight if you cannot get into melee range
---
Mirage (Staff / Staff) [Condi DPS]
---
* Just a very fun condi build, too slow of open world imo though
---
Weaver (Staff) [Power DPS] (Will soon be running with Grieving)
---
* Cool looking skills
---
* Lots of AoEs
---
* Still competitive in damage against bosses
---
Take a look at banner Michael!
---
I feel your pain, i started out as a ranger in gw1 and in gw2 it is a very boring class. 
---
However the best combo is most likely Greatsword + Longbow
---
im not surprised anymore ;)
---
I'm happy they are being wholesome instead of offensive.
---
This is an amazing shot of the Christmas Tree, thank you
---
*Banners, Banners every where*
---
*And the DPS did shrink*
---
*But all my loot drops stink*
---
Yeah, this is the thing that bugs me too. I'm fine if they don't have a portal, but for all the maps without a portal, I wish they would add something like the helicopters between Bjora and Grothmar.
---
Given the option, I would rather talk to an NPC at the Vigil and take a Pact airship to Dragonfall than use a waypoint.
---
Not just standard, [Battle Standard](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Battle_Standard)!
---
The helicopter you arrive at Jora's Keep in during the first story instance is still there in the open world and will take you to either the Blood Keep or the Black Citadel.
---
Bloody cow! Someone was really, really bored
---
Exactly. Even barring the 7s fee, I just want some degree of immersion.
---
As I understand it, the reason WoW can do this but GW2 and ESO can't is because WoW uses individual servers that you are locked to while GW2 and ESO use "megaservers" so you never have dead maps.
---
Stupid mthrfckrs RoF stuck with DL for 5 months omg anet is fcking retarded
---
it's not about thinking what i want, your build is objective garbage even at what it's meant to achieve, since you pointlessly cripple your damage for some imaginary value..like i'm pretty sure deceptive evasion with fencer and sword is more dps and enough clone output(spoiler: no clone generation besides normal stuff is enough output already)
---
 at this point you might as well run harrier or something and replace signet trait with illusionary inspiration, replace that chaos garbage with dueling and take deceptive evasion..bam, a real 1 man army!
---
i'm not sure what raids you do where someone goes away for 1 freaking minute to need quickness lasting that long except idk, qadim lamp? dhuum greens and sloth mushrooms take 15 seconds or whatever and even then, does that person need quickness while walking around? cuz stm will instantly apply it the moment you shatter and you spam those f-skills anyway
---
"hard carry" is such nonsense! you can hard carry by playing like 2 heal scourges 2 staff tempest heals too and just rezbot forever, no? there becomes a point where certain things are overkill and make no sense from a realistic perspective
---
I love her lil pink nose. :D

None had a christmas tree or were the same instance, Ik we all know but mb for posting something different.

All classes can be versatile in builds and gameplay in multiple game modes. Which is why this game is great regarding character customization.

I love when the comunity does this kind of shit, more photos here  [https://imgur.com/a/FxpAXxQ](https://imgur.com/a/FxpAXxQ)

Guardian is pretty versatile in most game modes.
---
You can check metabattle open world builds. But personally I use full berserker with longbow and greatsword on my SB, smokescale and jaracanda or wolf for the pet (jaracanda if you want more heal, wolf for fear cc)
---
Soulbeast dagger+axe / greatsword is quite fun for open world. Smokescale and jaracanda for pets. Sic’em beng your bread and butter burst utility.
---
Hello there.
---

---
Which support class can dish out insane number of heals?
---
Not necessarily but you will need 250 of all currencies from Season 4.
---
Funnily enough, guilds like that are the thing I shy away from the most, I personally find it overly annoying and far too much of a bother.  
---
The best guild I've been in spawned from a group of 6-8 of us who met through dungeons and couldn't just speak in party chat (since cap of 5), so guild came about. We rarely did anything "guild like" but it was just a place to talk about random stuff whenever you felt like saying stuff.
---
I'm in no way saying that this is for everyone, but just pointing out that what does make a guild "great" is wildly different from person to person.
---
 Plaguedoctor Scourge? I have never heard of that.
---
I hope people who spammed banners will get a few days of timeout to reflect on their behavior.
---
Above everything
---
You need to do the Jahai Bluffs story up to the point you claim your sun's refuge, and you need to do the Dragonfall episode in full. Other than that, nah. Though you'll probably want to start each episode's story until you get to the map for that episode, after that you can ignore it all.
---
Surviving in those comes mostly from knowing what to dodge/block/distort. You should still take your generic Signet of Inspiration and Well of Recall with this build.
---
Looks pretty effective.

Lesser deathmark or however the mechanic is called commonly nowadays will port dhuum to a random player in the arena.

Yes to add on this comment ^ there are “extras” that Sylvari get to experience in the Heart of Thorns story that other races don’t get!

&gt; What are the pros and cons of letting the system sleep after 30 minutes versus never?

Energy saving primarily. Mine never goes to sleep, but I don't use HDD's.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'd check if the graphics card is running properly, get GPUZ and check details, like PCIe version.
---
If somethings odd, reseat your card.
---
Also check for CPU and GPU temperature, they usually clock down when overheating, maybe there's something wrong.
---
You can also try to use DDU to uninstall your driver, then install it again.
---
With your resolution and this hardware the game should run damn smooth on max graphics.
---
Thank you Eris. Sad to see you go but we appreciate everything you've done to help keep the raiding community afloat.

I remember countless bought Gorseval instances and much relief from not having to do Spirit Run. LOL

Fashion Wars 2 in a nutshell:
---
Left: The character you want to create.
---
Right: The character you created.
---
So you were basically complaining and whining about something before you had even tried to check it out..? Because it was quite clear at the very beginning of the patch as soon as you unlocked the Mastery that it was connected to the Spirits. Heck the symbols of the essences themselves are literally pictures of the Spirits. 
---
It seems quite silly to complain about something already when we know for a fact that they are going to expand on the map (and the mastery) in the next update. Maybe they will give us information overtime instead of just shoving it straight in our face all at once?
---
u are a legend. i will remember you fondly even as someone who has quit the game. thank you
---
Thank you for all your dedicated effort and time spent to serve us well \\o/
---
Hey, have a gorse instance?
---
Each banner represents a person kicked by elitists, what a memorial:-D
---
...and the shoulders and the feet.
---
A quick search in google image can show that there are many other ways to design "anthromorphic-ice-creature".
---
I think there is a way to get infinite altitude so long as you can start with a boosted dive
---
Wasn't she just that grateful for exchanging her family's heirloom for a favor? And then was kind of charmed by commander's ability of " beating the odds"?
---
Cool.
---
Was this dialogue with Researcher Yarixx in Bjora Marches added to the game recently, or is it only unlocked after you unlock the first tier of EM?
---
 "*Essence manipulation... Isn't this exploiting the Spirits of the Wild?"*
---
" Yes! Isn't it fantastic? For so long, the norn haven't been able  to TRULY harness the essence of their own spirits. Overall, I think  they'll be quite pleased. "
---
And ESO managed to come up with a new design. The post is clearly not about the idea of making a "big man made of ice" but about the specific design and body features that are extremely similar.
---
For example, a game can come up with its own version of a "area capture" battleground map, most MMOs and FPS have one. But [when you suddenly use the same geometry and design features...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/da3w3x/eternal_magics_pvp_arena_looks_super_similar_to/)
---
Watch her streams, she produces pretty neat content.
---
Sorry I do not get
---
U used to sell raids to ppl for your profit now that none buys anymore u stop and ppl are sad and Ty you?
---
I think lumping in all raiders with elitists is toxic in its own right! :)
---
Sad to see you go, but at the same time, your service should have never been needed. We, by all means, should be able to open any instance we cleared. Every time you would open an instance for us, I could only imagine how many hours it would take you to get those instances...Gl to you!
---
I think sylvari is the best to start with - evey1 else explained why. It also feels the most... idk... 'magical' because ur a tree elf running around in the forest.
---
hahah ur hilarious
---
The whole story isn't available (yet). The Asura are, in general, very curious what new things are concerned and in the own history of the races, they don't really care about the twisting of discoveries to their needs or experiments if they deem something necessary. Look at the Sylvari as the best example.
---
I mean, for all we know, the Norn couldn't or wouldn't want to use those essences because it might abuse and manipulate the Spirits essence itself or what they stand for as a spirit of the Wild. Asura don't care about that, they want results.
---
Yarixx himself says something like this 
---
&gt; In short, I've weaponized spirit essence against the very beings that produce it!
---
He weaponized spirit essences! which might be something that the Norn are not okay with. And furthermore, you ask:
---
&gt; Essence manipulation... Isn't this exploiting the Spirits of the Wild?
---
And he answers with...
---
&gt; Yes! Isn't it fantastic? For so long, the norn haven't been able to TRULY harness the essence of their own spirits. Overall, I think they'll be quite pleased.
---
So maybe the Norn didn't WANT TO harness the essences of their own Spirits or were never able to reach that level on their own because of their Worship of the spirits...
---
Nice.
---
Hmm, I think I saw that name. I fly there from time to time 'cause flying with Beetles is awesome. Also with my red sylvari/griffon. What was your guild tag?
---
Reminds me of a method people used for fighting Mallyx in GW1. Everyone goes through the door to the arena except for a necro. Then they all let themselves die and the necro teleports their bodies back to the other side of the door and they kill Mallyx through the door. Dunno if it ever got patched.
---
As a "newbie" myself of \~ 6 months I was keen to watch this and see how others fare when they are really new. What a let down. Not even a new player, just someone who has played for ages and sounds like she doesn't even like the game very much.
---
Would have been way more informative if she had said "I was confused by/did not like x, but found this solution".
---
Id rather watch some endgame high tier content, speedruns e.g. but sadly no one does. I don't like boobie streams. I have a girlfriend. I can see boobs every day
---
WoW players _are_ a different breed
---
I like your thought though I doubt it's true.
---
Remember when they told us we can’t have more than 20 guild hall decorations near each other cause the game couldn’t handle that many items? Yeah, I call bs on that now lol... Fix the guild hall local area limit anet pls and ty.
---
I use writs :)
---
Don't look at her boobs then? She also has a face
---
Im not watching her Stream. Problem solved.
---
Sorry, this video is not meant as a guide really - I get that you wanted more detail but there’s a ton of information out there for newbies and it would be too much to put in one video (PvP, Raids, Fractals, etc). I work full time and stream most weekdays so it’s just not possible for me to put out extremely high level, detailed content. This is a personal experience I wanted to share with the community. I haven’t even began to experience everything in the game yet! :) My video is a thanks to everyone who has helped me along the way and a chance for people to laugh a bit at how genuinely confused about the game I was. Everyone’s experience with GW2 is different and I wanted to share what mine looked like. But if you’re looking for information then it might be worth joining a streamer/YouTube community discord to ask questions. There was not one problem I struggled with and found X solution, I learned over time how different and unique GW2 is: The clips in the video should go some way of showing my experiences, but the point I tried to make is that it doesn’t matter how badly you think you’re doing as long as you’re having fun. :)
---
I thought gw2 hook was the one that can remove the bloom. Or can d912pxy do that too?
---
&gt;not seen as unusual at all
---
Jormag seems like not trying to destroy world, just reshape it (I guess freeze everything, "Snow Queen" ideal) Since its not imminent treat, nobody freaks out, YET.
---
I mean the easy counter to most of your points is that if you have no interest in performing better in raids, then why are you watching and trying to get close to a benchmark video DPS in the first place? 
---
Do you want like 36 caveats inserted into the description of every video? Oh we used EA but you might have have that, oh there wasn't AP here but you might have it and actually get more DPS, etc.? If the video says "with allies" I'd imagine someone would take the time to find out what "with allies" means whenever they see that they're not hitting the benchmark numbers.
---
I do my benchmarks until I get a number that is "good enough" and then I put a realistic average number doing the same rotation in the thumbnail. It should be fairly obvious by the huge AVERAGE NUMBER text on every thumbnail that the benchmark number is somewhat grinded.
---
Weapon stowing is part of the game. To my immediate recollection, it has not been important to hitting the benchmark number in any build since I started playing the game minus core warrior, where you used to cancel the 2nd hit of double chop (which has since been patched out of the game). It was used on a few condi warrior benchmarks way back in the day of tactics but has not been used in years except for the current condi BS rotation, where guess what, you can hit the number without stowing any animations.
---
The vast majority of benchmark videos show food and traits at the end. I don't upload mine unless I remember to do it. The correct food, utility, and traits should always be on the SC build page. 
---
Your last point is just absolutely wild. People ask all the time what numbers they should expect to hit without infusions in the public discord, or how they could replace their gear. You're creating an issue where there is none, nobody goes in and expects to hit the benchmark without infusions. 
---
If you used warrior GS3 on the golem and didn't realize that it hit more the longer you were on the boss, that's incredible honestly. The most used trick in the book to get more dps on warrior has been to GS3 into a wall in the boss' hitbox. I did this when I first played the game years ago on Lupi's hitbox, it should be fairly obvious to anyone using the weapon longer than 5 minutes. It's even spelled out multiple times in the SC boss guides that you should GS3 into walls.
---
If someone links the SC website, they're linking it for the general rotation that people should know. Nobody tells them to hit golem numbers. The resource is there because it's asked for and Harry is generous enough to run the whole thing and ask his guild and other experienced people for help to fill in the gaps.
---
&gt;is it only unlocked after you unlock the first tier of EM?
---
This.
---
Seems like you were one of them
---
Do not turn on English caption.... Guild Wars 2 is translated as Dildos Do. I got a good laugh and the way she explains Dildos Do
---
LOL I saw that too haha. Just to be clear that’s auto generated and I had absolutely nothing to do with the subtitles
---
Which Spirits of the Wild did Jormag corrupted? I played the episode and didnt remenber anyone talking about this
---
If your situation is such that you have to choose either or, then there are better living world seasons to buy. You can still access Silverwastes and Dry Top without Season 2, so loot-wise it's a non-issue. 
---
If you're a completionist, you'll need to get it in order to get a backpack, bloodstone dust eater, Ascended Nomad rings and accessories and 3 sets of pretty descent looking armor skins. 
---
Although the quality of the storytelling differs from season to season, if you want a coherent experience, you should get them all. My wife doesn't know wtf is going on at the start of season 2 with Braham, Rox, Jory, Kas, Taimi and Canach because season 1 isn't available. I imagine it'll be even more confusing if you have a two-season gap going into HoT.
---
Did you try to enter there with so many banners? You will have below 10 FPS,  instance lagging, 300+ ping, people crash all time.
---
i lold. :D  
---
(but seriously guys.. this is just a video on my personal experience, and in future i hope i can make actual content. it's not intended as a critical thinking piece) &lt;3
---
I think he talks about the shamans we can see in the new map, leopard, raven and bear. But at no point corrupted spirits of the wild themselves are ever mentioned. Only stolen Raven's magic and corrupted shamans.
---
I don't install anything I don't need, no MSI afterburner, only Windows defender is running, no firewall on for private network so, trust me, my windows is blotter free, the first thing I do is to uninstall all these Microsoft Store extra BS I don't need.

You can, but most people won't.
---
Thief Shadowstep stomps. It's satisfying.
---
I tend to do story on different races, I highly recommend you do the same as there are extra dialogue or even achievements.
---
Core: Any, but sylvary is a solid pick to get introduced to Threarne, a major character earlier (there's an achievement for doing the first parts of the story for each race, from the first episodes until you reach the point in core story that is the same for all races, iirc it's when you get introduced to the order of whispers/vigil/priory).
---
Lws1 is unavailable to play so. Skip.
---
Lws2: Sylvary.
---
HoT: Sylvary.
---
Lws3: Human
---
PoF: Human, not sure if choosing baltazhar on character creation has extra dialogue.
---
Lws4: Any
---
Lws5/icebrood saga: Norn (or Charr, the prologue is very Charr themed, play at least prologue as one).
---
Never happen to me in raids but few times back in the dungeons era yea:-P
---
Imagine the npc to talk to enter unlocked instance is named Eris!!! :D
---
&gt; then why are you watching and trying to get close to a benchmark video DPS in the first place?
---
To make sure I'm not missing some crucial knowledge about the rotation or the class.
---
&gt; Do you want like 36 caveats inserted into the description of every video?
---
Yes.
---
&gt; it has not been important
---
&gt; minus
---
&gt; but has not been used in years
---
&gt; except
---
Isn't it a bit too many "but"s? How about having none? Can you vouch for everyone else that they don't have these "but"s that they're quietly benefiting from but aren't sharing with anyone?
---
&gt; People ask all the time what numbers they should expect to hit without infusions in the public discord, or how they could replace their gear.
---
And what if I don't use (or don't want to use) your public discord? Why isn't this information available publicly on the website?
---
&gt; nobody goes in and expects to hit the benchmark without infusions.
---
No, but I expect to not be gimped by not being able to cap crit chance, condi/boon duration. Some of your builds rely on using infusions to cap these stats. And without infusions drastic changes need to be made, which can impact the DPS in was less linear way than just having less +damage infusions.
---
&gt; If you used warrior GS3 on the golem and didn't realize that it hit more the longer you were on the boss, that's incredible honestly. The most used trick in the book to get more dps on warrior has been to GS3 into a wall in the boss' hitbox. I did this when I first played the game years ago on Lupi's hitbox, it should be fairly obvious to anyone using the weapon longer than 5 minutes. It's even spelled out multiple times in the SC boss guides that you should GS3 into walls.
---
The golem isn't next to a wall. It wasn't clarified anywhere there there exists a very specific distance at which GS3 will hit small golem 1 or 2 more times than normally. I am still pissed about the time I wasted until I figured that out.
---
&gt; whats this all about? how can I start raiding weekly?
---
Those groups you find are looking for people who know the Raid encounters so that they don't have to carry players through them. It is like a company looking for experienced developers because of the job they have to do instead of hiring inexperienced that need time to get to work on what you actually should do.
---
You can find raiding guilds that offer training of those encounters like r/guildrecruitment/, others also have linked the training discord where you can find people who also need the training.
---
Another thing is that you should learn the rotation of your profession (or multiple professions at best, better even in multiple roles) and practice that. You can also find videos of encounters and watch them to prepare for them so that you are not getting surprised by certain mechanics.
---
Ping playing on NA from EU isn't as bad as you might think. I suspect that ping is not reason #1 this has not happened yet.
---
&gt;I finally unlocked a single tier of it so the mastery ui would shut the hell up about it

What? Didn't you unlock every single tier asap?! Those extra four blue (and occasionally two green) items are totally worth it! /s

Don't you need at least 10 people to get the bonus pips? Guess the joke's on you. ;)

I was finally convincing myself that I just need to be playing more casually and only care about the living story. But then anet dropped Ep1.

Pliz don't play Quickbrand Healrene when you could go Healbrand Alacrene.
---
Its more deeeeeps, yeah ... but those specs just juggle way to much and focus around husling for dps. Thats retarded for a support / heal combo! Your hyper reliant on the other person to know his shit and have vastly inferior defense compared to a Healbrand / Alacrene where you can fcking facetank bossmechanics and never need to dodge (tho dodge instant-mechanical oneshots pliz)!
---
Glory to Healbrand Alacrene, its great to Netflix and chill, not stress yourself doing daily CMs.
---
Instances are saved per person. Each boss and some pre events have a flag assigned that gets set when you clear it. When opening your instance, the game checks the flags front to back and opens the instance at the first flag that isn't set. Bosses in an instance always apear in the the same sequence, even if you killed them before. These flags reset on monday morning.
---
e.g. You killed VG, did Gorse pre and Sabetha, but skipped Gorseval. Now you open your instance. That instance will have both Gorse and Sabetha alive since the sequence is VG-&gt;Gorse Pre-&gt;Gorse-&gt;Sabetha. If you then kill Gorse and leave, the next time you open W1 it will be cleaer already since all flags were set.
---
Don't play the story much (it's terrible anyway), and just enjoy playing and exploring the classes and world.  I lock in a character for each class, and play all of them.  Stick to nearby goals, like completing the area I'm in, dailies, collections, etc.
---
Also, log in daily.  You get free levels periodically, which is especially nice if you're away for a while, since it still moves you through some of those level gates.
---
And buy Path of Fire.  The mount makes traveling around better (I can't imagine putting up with the cruelly awful walking speed) and a free level 80 jump for a character, so you have at least one that isn't level-gated anywhere, while the rest climb the ranks.
---
The guys afking on spawn usually join, we call them scouts ;)
---
How come Dhuum doesn't need a valid path?
---
Up there is invisible floor.
---
Is the game worth coming back to? I consistently come back on and off over the years, and Wintersday is by far my favorite event. I’ve stalked the reddit and heard things like “dead game” or whatever. Still one of my favorite MMORPGS. Any advice?
---
Thank you for your contributions to the NA raiding community, Eris! You've made untold training groups possible and will be missed.
---
I truly hope the devs take this to heart and offer some way for those with cleared instances to open specific bosses for others.
---
It kept getting worse and worse to the point where my game straight up froze and had to be forced shut. Rip my characters in the aerodrome, tell me when it's safe to log back in!

&gt;What is the point of joining a guild that lets everyone in and demands nothing of them?
---
Easy company, a place to call home, access to guild related activities and content, possible shortcuts to expansions, and some quick daily harvesting.
---
Then that's what they wanted to think from the start.
---
First, come in Lion Arch Aerodrome to see lots of banners to lag yourself out.
---
Just kidding. There's a dedicated discord server called Raid Academy (Discord link: [https://discord.gg/gw2ra](https://discord.gg/gw2ra) ) for new raiders like you. Training runs aren't scheduled, so be sure to look them out as soon as you see them (or get pinged). Learning experience will be slow or fast depending on how well you learn your mechanics as well as group performance but it's the best way to start raiding.

Have fun o/

GW2 is the best MMO to go back to.  Keep reminding them about that :)

Self made content

guilty 🤐
---
I agree with this except that we don't have the data to compare gold faucets and sinks.
---
Could be that a steadily rising gem price is part of their system and they could balance the economy with it.
---
I think that sometime ago there was a debate whether we should have a system like the one we have now or lock our character and not be able to swap after we queue. If I m not mistaken both systems were tested and there was a poll, before we eventually ended up with the system we have now.
---
I don't know what is best, but I can't see why you think this is such a big deal. I have never played vs a class with 3 of the same class with one exception in unranked where everyone on the enemy team was mesmer. It was annoying but it is a very rare occurence. Does it happen often to you? Why do you think that class stacking is such a problem?
---
Tbh the main problem I see is if one player queues with 1 class to "force" the MM to have that class in the enemy team and then swap to a build that counters this class or queue as a dps only class and then swap to support to trick the MM so that they are the only team with a support. However I rarely see that happen in my games, so I cannot say whehter that is a big problem overall or not.
---
You can see the dogs on the minimap, use the glowy plant things to be immune to them and otherwise avoid them! It's pretty easy once you get the hang of it. It's also much easier with flying mounts, but then you run into the invisible walls of immersion-breaking!
---
This. There are mostly English training discords but if you keep searching you'll find some language specific ones too. Apart from that you could also find yourself a guild through the recruitment sub or the forums or ingame etc. People there often take new people with them :)
---
boon overcapping doesn't benefit the opposite group cuz that's not how boons work!you didn't explain shit cuz there isn't anything to explain..boons simply don't flow to the other group!
---
 the minmax version of stm is 0 bd not 50 either..so when comparing yours(which you conveniently buffed with DT and disenchanter) and the real bench, yours does 55% of that damage! yea totally comparable dude

maybe you can ask your buyers about how the videogame works, i bet they know more than you

The thumbnail already says random egirl streaming just chatting on Twitch, I dont think its necessary to start the video to see what its going to be.

Do you play every type of content? If so would a full diviner gear set for raids and fractals be enough? And a full marauder for wvw?
---
If only they would stack...

Well I do enjoy getting updated since its still relevant. Amount of banners is higher and higher by the minute.
---
Stop being a buzzkill, theres HIDE button for you and let others enjoy this fun bug.

If you only Stream to Show your body, might aswell swap the Platform to a webcamshow
---
True, most ppl who say PvP is bad are casuals who haven't reached enough to be in a state of endgame. It's good for them if they have enough to do in PvE. My PvE day though is playing T4+Recs (sometimes CM) and that's it for PvE. Raiding has a weekly cap so it doesn't even give much rewards. PvP and WvW is the content most Veterans play since it can be played with experiencing new builds and trying things out with being into theory crafting etc.

thank you babe! xx

Yes, you must be a Master of psychologie by judging my whole personality and life by 3 Comments. Why did you not win an award yet? Misjudging others by some comments who disagree with you is easy. Does Not get you any further in life tho. I criticised that she lacks content and just wants to show her body and wants to make money with it. Twitch is a platform for GAMING. If your stream is less gaming then showing your body, swap plattforms.

Sorry - you're saying I'm trying to look naked because my hair falls naturally on my shoulders? Sorry - what?

Thank you Eris! My guild and I have utilized your service quite often. Good luck on your future endeavors!

Monkey grip intensifies
---
Imagine if other services stopped for a month every year.
---
While they never tell us many things explicitly, we can piece them together through deduction. 
---
* Yarixx is a Vigil researcher.
---
 * For any given topic, there's always one asura or krewe researching it. Yarixx is the one researching spirits of the wild. We didn't met him until now because he wasn't relevant until now. 
---
 * The researchers of the orders keep looking for any way that can give the Pact an edge over the dragons and other enemies. It's not the first time a researcher has taught us something after researching the enemy. For example, a shining blade researcher takes Signet of Agony, and we learn to counter magics thanks to Taimi's studies on Zinn's research on ancient bloodstone magics.  
---
* The decorations and materials on the pillar indicate they likely are a mix of asura magitech (magical circuits embedded inside stone, not visible unless you crack the stone open or unless there's a window or hole in the stone showing magic inside) and far shiverpeaks norn craftmanship (same style as boreal weapons).
---
* Yarixx clearly explain why are exploiting the powers of the spirits. Basically a shortcut to use the power without asking for permission or communing with the spirits. Norn see the spirits of the wild with reverence. Can you imagine a Christian going to a church to capture the Holy Ghost with a proton pack and a ghost trap to then use it as a power source? Of course not. They go there to pray. 
---
 * Also, the power we are pulling off enemies is from the spirits lost to Jormag: Ox, Wolverine and Eagle. We still do not know what exactly happened to them, but these enemies are being imbued with their power.
---
* Dragons absolutely can infuse different minions with different magics. They were just focused in less kinds of magics until we started killing them and the magic one had ended up in the others:
---
 * Mordremoth used death magic to make mordrem out of corpses, it started with skeletal looking mordrem with skull faces, and he got so good at it the clones ended up looking just like the living, just woody, and was learning to use shadow magic to make countless copies of living subjects. We stopped him right before he could make an army of Logans and Zojjas.
---
 * Primordus was making vine-touched and death-touched destroyers after Mordremoth's death.  
---
 * Jormag started making icebrood with plant and death powers too, but much less, since it seems he got less magic from Mordremoth's death because of the distance. 
---
 * Kralkatorrik started making minions who could use lesser versions of his powers, branding corpses, making minions that could brand themselves, minions that could open rifts in the mists and all sorts of tricks from all the magics he got from Mordremoth, Zhaitan and Balthazar. 
---
* There's one constant with all the empowered minions: only new ones got the new powers. Old minions found along new minions still have their old powers. Fallen and aberrations appear to be new minions, but for svanir it many not be that they are now charged with blue eagle power, but that now we can see the blue eagle power Jormag was giving them to make them think they were getting 'dragon spirit' power as if Jormag was another spirit of the wild. 
---
* Jormag got less of the dragon power because of the distance. Most of the magic from Zhaitan was redirected by scarlet towards Mordremoth, and most of the magic from Mordremoth ended up inside Aurene's egg, and intercepted by the Bloodstone in Bloodstone Fen, then taken by Balthazar when the Bloodstone exploded. Primordus and Jormag got scraps, just enough to make altered minions. When Kralkatorrik was defeated, most of his magic went to Aurene.
---
* As for icebrood being imbued with death or plant magic, even if the small amounts of magic Jormag got were enough to do what the other elder dragons did with it, it doesn't seem like elder dragons like to do exactly the same things. They use the same types of magic in different ways. The 'plant' power of mordremoth could be a more generic "Growth" or "Nature" for another elder dragon, I already mentioned how Mordremoth used death and shadow in different ways to Zhaitan, making clones of coprses rather than animating the corpses themselves, then using shadow to clone the living rather than to infuse a [fish head to clone undead](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Undead_Spawner). Kralkatorrik used mordremoth's 'mind' power to make his minions work together better and to let them use his own powers, and death to brand corpses rather than just resurrecting them.  Aberrations are likely infused with some of the 'death' and 'shadow' along Wolverine's power, Fallen likely got some "Growth/Nature" and "Mind" as they are all animalistic and can confuse mixed with Ox's power. Svanir seem to be the ones affected the most by Jormag's core ice and persuasion powers, and end up turned into icebrood eventually.  We've also seen some svanir returning as icebrood after death.

This does not explain the three-digit-KPs though. I would imagine that you should be "good enough" with a lot fewer than those, at least it stops being a good indicator for experience a lot earlier.

Your comment history shows that it's not the only thing you don't get, always "laughing your ass off". Try to start from a grammar book, it might help to slowly improve your gettingit skills! As you said yourself, you are a casual player, and it seems you have zero understanding of how raiding in GW2 works. She wasn't selling RAIDS, she was OPENING raids for people to clear a particular boss because the game doesn't let you choose a boss to kill. Alas, you won't get the meaning of this anyway.

/u/rude_asura might be able to shed some light on this issue since he used to use his guild bank to middle for legit trades just in case.

Exalted Assistance
---
Sorry, don't mean to get in the way of your angeryness. Exalted Assistance is the defacto worst mastery. Then the Siren's Landing one I can never remember the name of. The new masteries at least have some purpose which grants access to more loot compared to those two.
---
ugh i knew you were gonna bring up this..yes, if you're absolutely capped on stacks and duration and everything they can go to other targets
---
it's not gonna happen with alacrity though because you don't apply it as much as quickness with stm and you don't need this for quickness anyway..but i guess since you play with boon chronos that can give no boons at all you probably have like 3 alacrity renegades too to justify overflowing bullshit that happens so rarely it's not even worth considering
---
dunno why you keep comparing your build with 50% bd stm still since you need, again, 0 bd for that! oh right, to make it seem better than it is!
---
you're basically taking your  9.3k-ish dps build, add dt disenchanter to put it to 11.5 and then drag the 20.5k-ish actually good stm build to 18.5k
---
it's a really nice trick to make something that is more than 3 times less dps seem like it's only 33-50% worse
---
Speaking of being disingenuous, if you instead search for "giant ice elemental," you will discover that all of these design  elements (lol) are common in ice elemental designs. 
---
Is it worth noting that all four (oh no, four specific points of similarity!) of these things you point out are found not just in these designs, but in many, many designs? Is it the kiss of copyright infringement death that these two share more similarities than most?
---
Is it also worth noting that there isn't a single, and I mean not one single solitary aspect, of either of these designs that is unique or original?
---
This isn't the first time this has happened. Yes, maybe it's the first time someone has brought it up regarding these two specific models, but every single God forsaken day someone in some game subreddit makes a post comparing two elements of different games and saying "DAE think these are literally the same?" 
---
Thing is, 99% of the time they're either pointing out  vague similarities or getting excited about something so incredibly generic that it's almost unbelievable that anyone would actually think there was a specific source like "oh noooo this indie game has elves with pointed ears looks like they plagiarized WoW."
---
"Whoa, isn't it uncanny that these two big ice elementals *look like big ice elementals?*"
---
thats actually very true. exalted assistance really is the one mastery i actually never used while completing my HoT masteries
---
It's a shitty practice, but why do we need a reminder exactly?
---
Aw okay thanks !

Eris, thank you so much for your service to the community. I've been personally impacted so much from the work you've done. From the days of getting instances for sales in MnF, opening my training raid instances, getting our Gors instance every weekly clear in DnT, opening the countless bosses we've gone for record grinds on in DnT and dP, and of course the countless random pug runs you've opened throughout the past couple years of raiding. You've been a huge help to the NA raid scene. I hope you are having fun outside gw2!
---
Thank you.

The amount increases and theres stuff literally written on the wall with banners.

If its good people will upvote it. Thats how reddit works. You dont have to come to every comment section related to banners and paste your negativity. Just hide and move on.
---
Not identical. Far too similar to be coincidence, however.
---
And here comes my 2d macro! 
---
Actualy it wont ever happen. Exp enough for 300kp+ groups in fracs (they r realy easy) and noone will notice i'm less than 300 by my gameplay.
---
And i won't ever fake raids kp, unless i'm realy good at it ( as fracs ), cos raids r more strict to "know mech and no mistakes".

..really
---
Easiest way to avoid this?
---
If you get gold mailed to you from someone you don't recognize, return to sender immediately. Don't accept it.
---
If you're running a Hero Point train, the chances of you receiving a "tip" for your services that is enough to trip any alarms on Anet's end are small, so take some time to try and remember who was in your squad for the farm. If the sender sounds familiar, go ahead. Otherwise, try sending them a text mail back and asking what the gold was for - an RMT seller probably won't reply in a meaningful way; a kind player will thank you for the HP train. 
---
As for stuff on GW2 Exchange, I don't think there's any way to truly protect yourself there. Trading outside the TP is done at your own risk already.
---
We? You.
---
Theres a Hide button which is way faster than intentionally coming to comment section to bitch about it and wasting everyones bandwith to load your shitty comment that doesntadd anything towards the topic.
---
Anet has been happy to set the record straight by responding to these guilty whiners' threads in the past, publicly shaming them in front of the community. Whenever someone makes a thread pleading their innocence, they give Anet support reps a right to tell their side of the story.
---
Every time they don't do this, I tend to believe whoever posted the thread.
---
I think the original post that screenshot was from has been deleted (or I'm just having trouble searching for it from mobile.)
---
But, if it's the one I'm thinking about, the issue was that the person didn't use the "return to sender" button. They accepted the gold, which triggered alarms at Anet, and then sent a new mail back to the person with the gold attached.
---
Eventually, a lead GM replied, apologized profusely, and unbanned them.
---
If this is that case then, honestly, this seems more like an unavoidable, honest mistake, and a reminder to not accept the attachment at all.
---
Im the chak lad XD Just want to say, I’m not perma banned, it was a temporary ban, which is over but the account is still flagged for RMT. But none of my stuff/ gold was given back, and even after typing to Anet i just get mails about not to use RMT. Half of the questions don’t even get answer. As I said in the video, all my gold can be traced back to the game, but they won’t put the time to do that, since they were not sure in the first place that the chak was obtained in a "wrong way", they just took it to be safe thats what i got in a mail from one of the gms, which I also showed in the video.

Quickbrand and Alacrigade
---
This usually doesnt happen so ill take a guess. Whats the refresh rate of your monitor? 60?75?144hz? Does it have gsync/freesync? Are you using fps limiter? This resolution is very very uncommon for the typical pc monitor so id say its a custom resolution?Maybe you're running on an old TV screen with zero sync technology? If you have way more fps than your refresh rate can handle and you dont have a screen with freesync/gsync features you will get annoying stuttering or weird graphics. Try limiting to 60fps for a start. Your CPU has an intergrated GPU on it which is  slow, very slow. Go to Nvidia panel and check if your 2070s is your Primary Display Device.
---
Also first.....if you bought your system prebuild then my condolences you have a good CPU, a good GPU and pretty much everything else in your system is bad quality hardware. It could even be second hand for all you know unless you bought it and installed it yourself ( a lot of prebuilds use second hand refurbished parts and sell em at full retail price). Which means that there is a chance that stuttering could come from any component of the pc. What is your CPU cooler?Is your cpu reaching too high temperatures after a while and throttling? This could also cause instability. Run MSI afterburner while playing the game so you can check your CPU/GPU clocks,temperature and load while playing. Try to play some other games preferably new games and see if you have the same problems there. Maybe it's specific to GW2.
---
Second, why the hell do you need 32gb of ram? You arent gonna use that anywhere so you waisted about 100$+ on literally nothing. Do you even know what speed it is? 3000mhz?3200mhz?3600mhz?
---
Download CPU-Z/GPU-Z and seriously check what stuff you're running. Cause right now even if the problem is right in front of you it's impossible to detect.
---
Legend. Thank you for all you've done.

Raven was not corrupted indeed.

Ox, Eagle &amp; Wolverine were. Those are the 3 essences we can collect and channel.
---
Raven's sanctuary was captured by Svanir which allowed them to channel it in some form. Raven is still alive, how else could she bless Jora's Keep at the end of a successful meta.

But you dont need your weapons out to cast mantras so you could go get a 2nd stick and then return instead

"If you go out into the forest full of wolves, blame the wolves for being beasts."
---
Yes, these are our minds to blame (and male ones doubly so). All people tend to generalize because that's how minds work. When we see something that looks like a duck, swims like a duck, quacks like a duck, and is next to several other very similar duck-like things, we first and foremost assume it's a duck, and are skeptical when we're told that it's purely coincidental. When we see a thousand pretty girl streamers going out of their way to look sexy for their audience (some succeeding as much as to sell their bath water), we will assume that the next one is doing the same. We, people, are simple animals - especially the younger we are (and you surely know how many younger people are on the internet compared to older ones).
---
Again - it's (indeed!) your channel and your life, you can and should dress and market as you like - it's just that it won't rid you of the consequences of your choices when they hit real world scenarios. If comments like the ones in this thread make you upset, you can either
---
* a) use that as a learning experience and change your tactics if you see that your reception doesn't match your intentions, or
---
* b) ignore them and push forward with your tactic, possibly minimizing intersection with unaccepting environments to keep your sanity.
---
For content that I personally enjoy making, I chose strategy "b" and do what I find right even if that cuts my audience considerably, but for interacting with independent online communities, it's mostly strategy "a" (as in: "this Western game sub hates anime stuff, so don't bring it here or else"). I see that you're going with strategy "b" and are enjoying it... but do not really want to accept the predictable reception that it will get in the current world.
---
I have, in my case, watched the video and found it on the lower side of content-to-time ratio, and lacking in production quality - but both of these traits are in line with the "genuine, personal" experiences that twitch streamers commonly provide for their audiences. Even though what you say is true, this could've been said in a couple text sentences and that would've been it, but it's a video with you and clips of you streaming - it's about the content creator as much as it is about the game; it's not "neutral information", it's information for those already interested in the persona. This, with extremely rare exceptions, is not content for me (nor many other players), so I simply go past it - unless it's advertised and discussed on a 3rd-party platform, in which case I might share my opinion... and naturally *assume* things directly depending on what I see.
---
I'm honestly typing all this in hope that your concerns are genuine - despite all your marketing - and that if I do type this, you'll consider this whole situation from a larger point of view instead of just getting mad at random Internet dudes for thinking wrong things. Sadly, that here is how the world already is - that's how the world taught us - so that's how it will stay for the foreseeable future. I've similarly fought with reality enough and mostly failed to change anything, but if you want to make a change yourself - in this case, teach people that one can both be pretty on the thumbnail and provide deeply engaging well-produced content on the inside - all power to you, definitely! But this particular video, as you can see, still falls short and didn't manage to convince a considerable amount of people - and thus the comments that we have.
---
It is actually super fun content ! (Where i get to play chrono &lt;3)
---
Absolutely, the game is still very well alive despite the mood of doom and gloom of the subreddit.
---
i like
---
JFC when is it going to stop XD.
---
what does a gdpr request do and how do u do it?
---
Abandoned end game content sadly. Although they fixed the respawn issue a few patches ago afaik. Still fun to do them, yes
---
Yeah, they're fun! They even have weekly rewards! 
---
(Just play Chrono everywhere)
---
reminds me of [FPV drones following cars around!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSzHvaPifYY)

In the meantime dozens of people do that service for free on EU. Gives you some perspective.
---
So confused by the banner thing, but this is impressive.
---
Makes sense, was just worried that this could somehow spiral out to affect more people who are unrelated. :( Would hate to see an entire guild get suspended/banned for what one member does. 
---
Although if the entire guild is complicit in laundering the money, that's another story.
---
play any class. theyre all relevant
---
Banners don't despawn, I'd guess similar to hero or spiritbanner not despawning they use the same or some similar spaghetticode.
---
&gt; I make a personal plea to the Developers to implement a system where people can get their instances once they have cleared a wing.
---
They will propably do it on the day raids will have repeatable rewards.
---
Exp W5 Dhuum (ranged). Need portal mesmer, druid, healscourge, heal tempest, HB. ping kp + li
---
As somebody who led a lot of Guild Missions - doing curtains room duo sounds both amazing and nightmare inducing, so basically insane. Nice job.
---
&gt;net really should put in selectable bosses instead of relying on community members to fill in the cracks. 
---
Agree.
---
This is what caused my lol.
---
U al complain d about raid but I swear this is the fiery time I read about this.
---
I love your theory. Don't listen to the naysayers, trust your instincts.
---
Me, I think that the Elder Dragons are all manifestations of the same, hive-minded entity.
---
Even the colours are in order...
---
Have they run out of things to do in this game? Still cool though!
---
As someone else said
---
Btw no o do not care about raid
---
I would like the leg armor but even th few raids run required are more than I can stand
---
It was / it is an error
---
The fact that someone succeeded in making profit from this is wonderful and I love it
---
Really
---
He is just an excellent salesman.
---
But you should had been complaining about changing raid to strikes so that U could do you single boss when u Need .
---
This I the first time I read about this selling issue with this modes.
---
It is totally nonsense to me cause noone complained and all go crazy when I said raid should be removed and replaced by strikes.
---
It's a huge lol
---
Never understood raiding community
---
ty eris &lt;3
---
&gt; But you know you want to
---
Yeah no.
---
I'm fine with the single boss idea, and honestly it's fairly preferable at the moment, but It is very likely not possible to seperate the raids into single encounters now due to programming limitations, in which the best case is we get to choose which boss we can go into after clearing a raid. 
---
And as for why people went crazy when you said raids should be replaced with strikes, I can probably provide a decent answer. It's because strike missions are *piss* easy compared to even the easiest raid bosses. Just for the memes I went in there with a condi dragonhunter in a pug group and I was still top dps in that party and we got gold. Raids are supposed to be challenging content, and if the difficulty is not scaled up significantly, do not expect the raid community to take raids becoming strike missions lying down.
---
what ... how can you even do it that perfectly
---
It was complained about a lot when HoT launched, but then people like Eris stepped up. Dungeon selling and fractal selling also existed before this so it wasn't unheard of, though it is no excuse for Anet not including a core QoL update to raids after 4 years.
---
we dont have anything to do 1 week after every LS episode (and raids, fractal and co are dead by this point)
---
A chair surrounded by banners!
---
It must happen now. It cannot be avoided.
---
I've seen this posted all over but I think it is inaccurate, pretty sure s4 tome came with episode 1 or 2.
---
A staff that's a banner with the image of a banner in it.
---
wtf, 1 week? Are you guys rushing or is just not that much content?
---
As a paying customer and a player it really shouldn't be my responsibility to make sure that by using IN-GAME systems I'm not breaking rules.
---
It didn't come with the first episode.

Players' ways to lock down Gambling in Tyria!
---
You can still play Gameplay in that time. Thats how actual streamers/youtubers work. They represent the game. Not themselves. And this is the thing i am criticising here.
---
It is, though - Same way it's your responsibility to not continue using an exploit you find (and to report it instead.) Stuff like this is in the ToS you agreed to when signing up, and I can't think of a single other game where stuff like this wouldn't also happen - if you receive a million gold in the mail in WoW, (or a couple million gil in FFXIV, or other currency in other game,) and accepted it, then it turns out it came from RMT? Even if you didn't know, chances are you'd get a suspension, a removal of wealth, or a similar action. Any developer/support team worth their salt will listen to your appeal, of course, and the better will reverse the suspension and help you out, but you'll still probably see some sort of consequence.
---
Same thing as if you received a random check from some unknown dude IRL in the mail and redeemed it for a million dollars. If it turns out that check came from somewhere sketchy, your bank account would no doubt get a temporary hold on it, and you might even get a call from the authorities.
---
There's really only so much a developer can do to ensure stuff like this happens, since there's no way they could ever ban every single gold seller or other bad actor before they even start causing trouble. If Anet took the "innocent until proven guilty" route for every case of RMT all the time, they risk absolutely destroying the game's economy by letting those that use payment fraud and currency conversion to fund their operation, or put thousands of accounts at risk from those that choose to hack other players' accounts to gain their gold stock.
---
It's a bit of damned if you do, damned if you don't situation for the developer. Frankly, a suspension is temporary and can be reversed quickly, but letting RMT run free for too long can cause many more problems.
---
So, whilst I now understand this concern it sort of pains me. I like to tip people that do cool stuff for the community. People that run trains or help new players quite commonly get 10g from me as a thanks, even if I didn't need their service myself...
---
Yeah and we will never know if the world is actually round unless we went to the space ourselves. What a load of crap.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
In LA how would one notice a drop in FPS?

---
Well, here is a to a banner year for 2020!  Huzzah.
---
this ain't it, sis...
---
Someone has peered into The All
---
on Jah
---
Considering raids and high-tier fractals, quickness fb, healing fb and condi fb are all super desired builds as far as I can tell. If these are your goal, you might want to check out snow crows website. Not an fb player myself, but there are probably other viable options too.
---
at this point anet kinda hates guilds and communities even exist, they much rather you to play solo and only login every 2-3 months
---
You're seriously overreacting
---
easy solution would be to have 1 tome with sub sections, we then dont need to wait for future tomes
---
It is so weird to me since I get downvoted every time i say remove raid and make single fight as strikes.
---
And then you discover this
---
So funny to me
---

and

https://en-wiki.metin2.gameforge.com/index.php?title=File:Ice_Golem.png&amp;filetimestamp=20150213002955&amp;
---
Follow that pattern with the exception that the left and right hand styles are switched. And that came up on the first page of searching "ice golem" images in Google for me. Although it could still be true that they're all an homage to whatever the original was, or even that they're all based on a literary character that we're not aware of.
---
They are.  Ive seen people ordered to take them down.  You should report such things via the ticket system on the offical site.
---
There is only one content creator that does this.
---
Is he legally allowed to do what he is doing? Probably yes. Morally? Probably not. But in the end this is the world we live in.
---
Even so, you didn't really talk about what that experience entailed whether we're talking about the parallels and equivalents of GW2 in GW1.  For example; the solo-instance vs. the open world, raids vs. Dungeons/Elite areas, PvP Formats.  Early on, much of this can really be summarized in maybe 2 or 3 sentences that you re-visit later in your conclusion to expand upon.  
---
You talk about how liking the game was dependent upon the realization that GW2 isn't GW1, but then you don't really explain.  I think explaining the differences is important in order to identify your preferred playstyles and set the tone.  For example you introduced a lot of problems like inventory management or visual noise, but you didn't share the solutions to those issues? It felt counter-intuitive to introduce problems and leave them as unsolved mysteries.  No one is saying that you can't share your experiences, but what did those experiences teach you about the game or the distinctions between GW1/GW2?  
---
"Management" would be one such theme; whether you're managing your traits/specializations, your cooldowns in PvE vs. PvP, your understanding of a more action-based combat system (eg; Staff Ele Kiting) or that of managing inventory or bank space.  I think what newer players to GW2 will see is your frustration rather than your triumphs and it won't send them them the message that you want it to because they're not really seeing you in your happiest or most excited moments?
---
You get down-voted because your idea is a severe escalation. Removing content should never be a goal for any game.
---
Anal. Cereal. Fun. Session. Hmmmm
---
best username i could think of, sorry
---
I tested it out last night on my warrior. (Did report it, sorry folks wasn’t risking a ban) once you put down the banner and use a certain skill, they become literal permanent banners. They do not despawn after leaving the map, not can a warrior or anyone pick them up. So as funny as it may be (I got a load of laughter out of it) it can be considered visual clutter and unsure how it affects those on lower ends of the graphics side. I am pretty sure it’s going to be a hotfix. Because a warrior can spam those banners and put multiple types out repeatedly without the previous ones despawning.
---
If you don't want to do pvp/raids, here are some options: 
---
1. Achievements
---
2. Rare random drops from events/world bosses (ie Tequatl's Hoard)
---
3. Buy the recipe from the respective crafting merchant for laurels and craft it yourself.  I use gw2efficiency or the base ingredients list in the wiki to figure out what I have/need to make something.  You'll have to do some material refinement, but that's easily done through crafting.
---
4. Related to above - craft grandmaster marks and purchase weap from vendor
---
5. Get grandmaster marks from sPvP rank chests and purchase weap from vendor
---
Really, you can do it without having to do much running around (except to gather mats), and interacting with 2-3 NPCs at most if you have your crafting discipline maxed.  There are various methods for achieving the same result.  Personally, I went with the direct route (#3 above).  It just depends on the resources you have, and want to spend, to get your weap.  Don't raid?  No prob!  You can craft it.  Don't craft?  No prob!  You can get from sPvP grandmaster marks.  Don't PvP?  No prob!  Achievement reward!
---
I'm having a [deja vu](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/918/192/d30.jpg) moment.
---
Remember that some of these people treat GW2 like it's a part time job.
---
This comment should be upvoted more... I was trying to remember which mmo I saw with that design first.
---
This is not a banner bug post...time to get to work downvote gremlins.
---
u/Lishtenbird says here all the time that you're a typical youtube bitch who just discovered that it's possible to generate money from views by using own body and certain image that works on young horny guys, pretending that this low-quality approach is a way to create a valuable content and at the same time, playing dumb blonde while it describes your master plan of literally stroking the male part of playerbase. 
---
Drop the charade.
---
Pretty sure this is also against Patreon's terms of service, so your complaint should be why it's not being enforced, not why it's allowed.
---
No idea how widespread it actually is, though.
---
the problem here is that anet banns you even if you didn't open the mail or even are able to read it at all if your mail box is full so you dont even know about it to begin with
---
lotteries/giveaways *can* be used as a loophole in a such a way
---
but honestly your example is just a lot of extra steps for no real benefit.. people don't need to go through a fake draw within a fake time frame to make this happen.
---
GTFO of here with that sound logic!
---
I've always enjoyed paladin type classes so the guardian was a natural fit.
---
Level 1-80 can easily be described as "tutorial". You'd do yourself a favor by just getting a character to 80 and then experiencing post-Central Tyria/Personal Story maps and content as well as masteries and other things to work towards like ascended/legendary, etc.
---
Not sure if trolling...or actually that stupid.
---
Rude 🧙‍♂️
---
You get banned just by having the mail attached to your account. You don't need to accept the gold to get banned. You can (and people have) get banned even if you return to sender.
---
Imagine using guides instead of actually playing...
---
I was wondering if by having so many banners in a very small compact area negatively affected anyone’s performance.
---
I feel this explains the difference in mentalities perfectly. :)
---
All of them.
---
If there's the slightest hint of doubt in ArenaNet's banning methods, it's on them to demonstrate to us that the doubt is unfounded.
---
You get banned even if you don't accept the gold. Just by having the mail attached to your account, you get flagged for RMT.
---
Dude has apparently never heard of "jokes"
---
I mean, most of the gw2 community is too stupid to figure things out on their own, tbh.  Just look at the ones wanting to get into raids or high level fractals, or hell, even dungeon mechanics.  Lots of people in GW2 don't bother to learn by playing.
---
it's what happens when you want to just click join on the first group you see and somehow magically complete the content without putting in any sort of effort
---
the obvious answer of posting their own damn lfg eludes most players or they simply refuse to play with others of similar skill level(namely 0)..because they know there's very little chance to actually kill the boss
---
people like OP don't even put in the effort of typing some words in the search function here on reddit or on google since this question has been asked a billion times already
---
tl;dr lazy bads wanting a carry
---
Nvidia had a 'feature' that buffered game video in a background buffer.  I disabled that a long time ago on my system to get rid of the stutter.  
---
Since nVidia added that feature when I updated my 960 drivers WITHOU mentioning it.  I no longer automatically accept any updates from nVidia for the drivers or the manager.
---
The new paradigm for software development is to release production code and let the users be 'beta testers', it's better to stand back for a few months.  True especially for Windows.
---
what "last time" should we be remembering and why?
---
Find a random guild group playing together while doing dungeons, fractals or PVE.  Ask if you may visit for a while because you are looking for a guild for social, partying or whatever is your focus.
---
This is tragic.  We will miss you.  Thank you for helping us out so many times.
---
I think we should be encouraging people to create content on the game instead of downvoting anyone who says nice things about her lol. 
---
I hope you keep pushing and making content, it’s definitely not easy but it will be cool to see how you and your content grow in the future.
---
Eagle, Wolverine, and Minotaur, iirc.
---
Good to know that mods are protecting dumb bitches who flash tits.
---
Leave Cello alone. Do you really want to scare away one of the only good content creators we have left for this game?
---
ok boomer
---
It's "common" in NA too, depend on the folks know what's up with fake kp.
---
i wouldn't buy if i were you, i've been playing gw2 for 5 years now, quitted recently because of poor management, and i wouldn't buy a new expansion in a million years, based on how they are managing this game currently
---
I'm going to say no because:
---
&gt;*Thanks for the wonderful input and curiosities, all! We consider this  portion of Glint’s Lair to be a “reactive” space—updating its knowledge  and responses based on the Lair’s occupants. A bit like an intelligent,  magic-driven A.I. that adjusts the space and details to fit its  visitors. If Vlast made it here, the elements of the lair would have  been presented differently. How so? Well, that’s another mystery….*  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;*Regardless—Glint is busy in the Mists, so she’s not really up for house calls right now!*
---
[https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/804120/#Comment\_804120](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/804120/#Comment_804120)
---
Glint was **not even present** during All or Nothing. That wasn't Glint speaking - that was a recording speaking. The lair was given a sort of AI that spoke in Glint's voice, and spoke as if it were Glint.
---
The only time players interacted with Glint was during [Storm Tracking](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Storm_Tracking).
---
To expand on the rest of your post:
---
&gt;In  Whisper in the Dark, Jormag is shown to have corrupted three spirits of  the wild a long time ago. The spirits were known to have traveled  between Tyria and the mists frequently. But this would imply that Jormag  had infiltrated the mists years ago.  
---
&gt;The enemies in Bjora Marches during the meta literally come out of mists portals.
---
It should be clarified that while it is pretty heavily implied that Jormag has corrupted those three Spirits, we do not have confirmation just yet. Especially given that there's no show of Owl's power which was most definitely consumed by Jormag.
---
Furthermore, Jormag's infiltration of the Mists began not with consuming the Spirits of the Wild, but rather with [kidnapping the Wolf Havroun in 1325 AE](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Wolf_Havroun). Jormag's use of Mist portals had disappeared after that ([mostly](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Frost_Portal)), and in Bjora Marches, the Sons of Svanir have captured the Raven Sanctum just like they captured the Wolf Havroun - most likely the few Mist portals we see in this map is due to the Fraenir capturing and using Raven's magic. In the meta, it's even confirmed that the Icebrood Construct we so frequently fight is made by the Fraenir using Raven's magic.
---
Given lore from S4 showing that Elder Dragons can use magic from other beings than just dead Elder Dragons, one would assume Jormag could use Owl's powers (and maybe the other three), but this isn't yet confirmed.
---
&gt;It's  heavily implied that despite hibernating, Jormag knows how to project  herself out of her body. She enters the Raven Sanctum invisibly through a  celestial-themed portal (more mists imagery) and enters the Fraenir's  body to control it.
---
I think you misinterpreted that intro to the cinematic. There's nothing to suggest the watery skyscapes are portals - and there are multiple such ceilings in the Raven Sanctum. Rather, Jormag seems to have entered Fraenir's body the same way that Mordremoth entered sylvari minds. This is why some - such as myself - believe this is how Jormag uses Death and Mind domains of Zhaitan and Mordremoth. Jormag didn't come through some portal - it's presence entered the room through its already present connection to Faenir.
---
That said, it doesn't need to be an icebrood body, given that it was confirmed in the GuildChat that Jormag possessed Almorra's corpse. And it should be noted there's no "liquid starfield in a ceiling" around Almorra.
---
&gt;Kralkatorrik's  control over the mists was considered a huge world-ending deal, but  Jormag's ability to do this is not seen as unusual at all. Is this lazy  writing (I hope not) or is it foreshadowing?
---
The main difference is that with Jormag, the ability is seveerely limited and, so far, only seen as borrowed. Furthermore, Jormag themself has not yet gone into the Mists unlike Kralkatorrik. With Kralkatorrik it was a reality-ending deal (not just world-ending, *multiverse ending*) because Kralkatorrik was personally in the Mists eating everything up. A huge difference indeed.
---
&gt;During the conversation as the Fraenir, Jormag suggests she's met Aurene in person before.
---
Not at all. Jormag merely states knowing what Aurene's wants are. Which isn't hard to figure out.
---
&gt;Glint took Aurene elsewhere to tell her something about the elder dragons in  All or Nothing. We never found out what this was. It was a very deliberate break in the conversation from Glint speaking to both of you, to her taking Aurene away from you and talking to her in private. In the same episode, they made a point of showing Glint's corpse. In Whisper in the Dark, they make a point of showing you twice that Jormag can infiltrate and puppet corpses.
---
I think you're trying to connect dots where dots don't even exist. Per the comment by ArenaNet above, Glint wasn't even present in her lair while Aurene was - I mean, her body was, but not her soul.
---
Regardless, based off of the lore in Bjora Marches, particularly around the meta, Jormag's most recent Mist access is from the Fraenir controlling Raven Sanctum, and per the story via Jhavi's dialogue, this is a very recent development - a post-Kralkatorrik development. So Jormag shouldn't have been able to send their consciousness to Glint's Lair even if they could find it (it was meant to be a sanctuary against Elder Dragons - if Kralkatorrik couldn't find it, I doubt Jormag could). 
---
&gt;The magazine ad for Bound by Blood gives an overview of the Icebrood Saga's story beyond just that episode: [https://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/releases/september-04-2019/](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/releases/september-04-2019/)  
---
&gt;Notably, it says:  
---
&gt;Get  ready for an escalating series of twists and turns that will eventually  lead you into the Shiverpeaks to confront not only Jormag, but also the  unpleasant truth that Elder Dragons aren't exactly what we thought they  were.  
---
&gt;So there's an  implication there that the Saga isn't actually just about Jormag, but  possibly about what Aurene was told by "Glint" back in season 4.
---
This just seems to be poor foreshadowing to cover the fact that some of us have known for years: the Elder Dragons are not mindless forces of natures or beasts that do nothing but consume and destroy, but instead that they're intelligent beings with their own personalities, intelligence, and desires.
---
I do not relate this to what Glint's recording told Aurene, though it is possible to be referring to what Aurene said as she was ascending into Elder Dragonhood:
---
&gt; **Aurene:** I can't explain what's about to happen, Champion...   
---
&gt; **Aurene:** But I want to share it with you.   
---
&gt; **Aurene:** All of you.
---
&gt; Glint took Aurene elsewhere to tell her something about the elder dragons in All or Nothing. 
---
She was telling Aurene about how she would have to die in order to stop Kralk.  That much was made very obvious
---
Oh yeah tell me about it ... once you are trough the backlog of older contend because you didn't start at launch, theirs only new living story maps, the mediocre story and endgame modes left.
---
With anet abandoning raids/fractals for at least 8-10 months, dungeons being that for years, WvW and PvP struggling to sustain players even on the t1 servers endgame is already out of the window.
---
The only other think many players still do is HoT metas and farm on the 1-2 LS maps with still have good farms, other than that and the newest LS episode is basically just a mediocre solo game...
---
1 week? I was done with all not time gated achievements at 2:00 CET on patchday
---
What backpack is it?
---
Bullfighters do not wear the cape, they carry it as a shield to confuse the animal and hide the sword before attacks.  
---
It's heavier and tougher than it looks (about 5Kg), but of course it can't stop a bull's horns. 
---
Moral of the story: Do not use capes as shields.
---
From link above:   (thanks Hax ..)

In some rare circumstances, you may run into errors that prevent you from interacting with the Black Lion Trading Post—normally accessed by pressing the [O] key in the game. If this is due to a server issue, we will provide updates via our official Guild Wars 2 Twitter account as we learn more about the problem.

Clearing Your Trading Post Cache
---
If you suspect the issue is limited to your account, we recommend clearing your trading post cache. Follow these steps to clear out any bad data that can cause errors:
---
    Completely close the game.
---
    Hold down the Windows and R key to open the Run prompt.
---
    Type %temp% in the box that appears and click OK.
---
    Find any folders named "gw2cache-(code)" and delete them.
---
        Example: gw2cache-(50641E0B-3AD4-1601-081E-6450D43A0116)
---
    Re-launch the game.
---
Wait, are raids/fractals actually dead? I started moving towards other games around the release of W5 but I remember both being very active.
---
That would vary depending on the last time you did it ...
---
*Unpopular Opinion* - *Anet support has piss poor internal communications between support staff that don't care because help tickets are just text filling an 8 hour work shift*
---
Certain things don't let you put a banner on them, and it defaults to the edge. If you out a second one down, it goes to the edge but moves slightly so they don't overlap. Repeat.
---
Why are you assuming that just because she is a pretty female that she is automatically a "boob streamer"? That's the reason people are upset with your comments to begin with. You automatically focus on her body.
---
I get one extra day off in December, which would be the 25th.  Anet seems to shut down for 22 working days this month.  Great for employees of the company.  Not great for players of the game.
---
ah, I see what you mean now.
---
Not yet. Most likely they're waiting for more releases before adding it, since when they added the Season 4 tome right away, that\_shaman went and spoiled how many entries it had.
---
They either a) do not know how many episodes Season 5 will have, or b) do not want to spoil how long the season will be. And we can likely blame u/that_shaman for this. ^((I'm kidding, we won't blame you shaman!))
---
The first one is pretty close indeed, besides the "sword", and feet\*. The last one not much though (it's a buff golem, doesn't have that slender look).
---
\*notice that special stalagmite feet style in ESO/GW2 golems (in comparaison to those "classically" shaped feet in the other golems)
---
But yes, it's probably an homage, that it's impossible to come up with anything closer to the resemblance between GW2 and ESO golems.
---
The Season 4 tome was added with Episode 1, actually. The Season 3 tome wasn't added until Episode 6.
---
Also, Sun's Refuge had a slot the entire time - between Episode 1 and 2, that\_shaman teased "something, something, seven" on twitter with the S4 Tome icon.
---
very... very short part time job
---
[Season 4 Tome](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Season_4_Portal_Tome&amp;action=history) was around since Episode 1. [Season 3 Tome](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Season_3_Portal_Tome&amp;action=history) was added with Episode 6.
---
No choice anymore than. Nag the game support.
---
It actually does start at the Kralkatorrik Emergence Zone. This is why it now has Aurene's crystals there instead - between War Eternal and Bound by Blood, she's been turning Kralkatorrik's corruption into her own less harmful kind.

It was more of "the Commander is famous, by sticking with them, I'll become famous. And rich."
---
god imagine being this angry and sad because someone is having fun playing a video game
---
This is providing more content than whisper in the dark did :^)
---
It's because they outsource their support to Zendesk. Which are just awful.
---
"Finally".
---
It's been there since the patch launched dude.
---
Do you have the original GW2 map booklet?
---
If not and you're in NA, I'd be willing to give up mine for someone who truely loves the game to enjoy :)
---
And the death of arcdps build templates.

Username Checks Out

So change it in options ez

"We won't escalate. What are you gonna do about it, huh?"
---
How would your respond to that? Because that's ANet's stance. They control everything about the game, and they don't give a flying fuck about one person.
---
If you want to get anywhere with this sorry excuse of a developer, you have to threaten their income.
---
2 of those things you mentioned are dead content.
---
I'm /r/OutOfTheLoop on this one. Can anyone explain what's up with all the banners on this subreddit all of a sudden?
---
You're right, fuck volunteering.
---
&gt; Moral of the story: Do not use capes as shields.
---
Wait it's not "Don't fight a bull (with a sword and a cape) for entertainment"?
---
The prophecies were right.
---
No they are not dead , you will find people doing them every day . Sure the raid scene is smaller , but that doesn't mean itya dead.
---
Check YouTube Channel "cellofrag". Look for his lastest wvw Videos. He is a GOD. In some videos he explained his newest build. Hint: its about condi reduc to 95% and gettin stamina for dodging when gettin debuffed.

You put your bib backwards.

Sieben Acht Gute Nacht.
---
&gt; Every piece of lore related to the norn and jormag was destroyed by the Anet
---
Uhm, no it wasn't.
---
A Burden doesn't retcon anything either. And even if you argue that it ruined the value of Asgeir's lore, it doesn't touch anything but why Asgeir survived/gave up the confrontation. Which is something we always knew, but had no explanation for why it happened.
---
And in all honesty, it makes perfect sense that the reason why Asgeir gave up was because the Elder Dragon who has a long ass history (since EotN) of using persuasive tactics to convince its enemies to do what it wants. The journal is far from out of character for either Asgeir (who had no personality prior to this update) or Jormag (as it fits Jormag 100%). What Jormag did with Asgeir is the same as what Drakkar did to Svanir, and what the Dragonspawn did to Zojja in Edge of Destiny. Use telepathy to play to their victim's weaknesses to convince said victims to do their bidding.
---
And we even know that the promises to Asgeir about letting the norn go was a lie, as nearly every source about Owl's death (which is indeed true - it was confirmed by the Owl Havroun at the time, who had a direct connection to Owl like all Havrouns do to their specific Spirit of the Wild) tells us that Jormag chased the norn as they went south.
---
its funny... your link doesnt show any ice golems, that look like the 2 above..
---
That was always a bit of an oddity, but ArenaNet seems to treat the unexplored world map as "typical Tyrian cartography" and not an accurate bird's eye view of the world. Hence why Dragonfall is still blue water when not yet explored.
---
start/windows key &gt; type %temp% and you're also there, no need to open Run since it also works in search, and %temp% brings you straight to the temp folder

I have [a guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide) with some info and links on it. Basic suggestions would be to focus on events and exploration when leveling, hearts tend to get boring and are not all that rewarding. Don't worry about build or unlocks while leveling, you can change them all at any time and you'll unlock everything by level 80. I'd suggest focusing on power damage till you get to 80 (power, precision, ferocity stats) and weapons/skills that help with that but again feel free to try everything out. Your server only matters for WvW (what team you're on) and region (in your case EU), otherwise you can play PvE and PvP with everyone on your region.

Actually it's more like:

Banner, banner, banner, banner, banner, banner, banner, banner, [Batman!](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/e8lnpa/obligatory_batmen/)
---
I sometimes offer to open gorse/kc/w7 post gate and did not ask for any gold yet I almost always get a 5g in the mail soon after opening. Maybe NA is just more giving too :q
---
I've never cleared it before, but I only have three folders with such a name, of which two are 6mb and one is 26mb
---
ah yes, the infamous hordes looking to get into dungeon mechanics
---
Yes, the bannerslaves went on a strike to promote their human rights.
---
Now we're just waiting for Anet to crush their hopes and dreams.
---
idk you probably not much into the raid or WvW scene, to say its all fine, to say its just like 2 years before and the disappearing guilds/communities which dont get replaced means nothing...
---
 They are and always still be players who do this content but comparing it with how it used to be is a bad joke.
---
Only fractals are sorta alive, but with a year without any content at all, even longer without a well-resived map, esp. the players who do the cm modes are leaving.
---
You can check the [official retailers](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/) for gem cards but most of them don't tend to keep them in stock. If you can't get a gem card you could also go with a pre-paid gift card like a temporary debit card. The gem cards I saw on amazon are over priced too so  be careful with that. Last option would be to send them gold in game, they can only claim 500g per week and there are exchange fees to convert it to gems but you could do it all in game.
---
well because its shoes are size 18+ ofc
---
Sometimes people just have a bad day. Someone can be an otherwise excellent player but be having a bad night.
---
I wouldn't block people unless they are REALLY egregious and obnoxious, like harassing you in PM or being consistently terrible.
---
Just kick them like a normal person, and stop bragging about how much of a baddass you are for blocking people.
---
Probably used the target markers
---
Well. Please tell me your ign so i can block u for beeing toxic, so i never ever apply to ur grps, ty
---
They found a bug, apparently if you use banner skill + mount you can endlessly cast banners

The nostalgia

&gt; If you put a second one down, it goes to the edge but moves slightly so they don't overlap.

They just told you.
---
I'm glad I no longer give money to this shit company. I'd rather not sell an ecto on the TP then get banned for RMT
---
only dead for elitists, not for new players
---
Go ahead and block me.   
---
It'd be my damn luck that if I ever got in with you, I'd have a bad day.   
---
Save yourself that risk.
