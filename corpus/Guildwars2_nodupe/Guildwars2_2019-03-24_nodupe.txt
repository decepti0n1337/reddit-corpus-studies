&gt;!Considering Kralkatorrik has also absorbed Balthazar's power on top of Zhaitan and Mordremoth which the others absorbed as well, i'd say he's probably the strongest atm until he dies. From what we've seen with the Balthazar and Kralk conflict when Balth WAS alive, he was gonna kill Kralk until we stopped him, and considering he was already drained of a lot of his power due to having his god status revoked, human gods are definitely stronger. They're just kind of useless when we need them lmao.!&lt;

---
Depends what you want to do.
---

---
If you are looking to roam, Spellbreaker, Holo, Mirage, or Boonbeast are pretty much the best. 
---
As for zerging, Firebrand provides boons and healing and will always be needed. Chrono provides boonshare, veils, and great AOE CCs and will always been desireable. As for DPS, you are basically looking as Scourge, Hammer Rev, Spellbreaker, and sometimes Weaver. 
---
I would personally recommend Spellbreaker. With Spellbreaker you can spec to one of the best roaming classes in the game or spec for big zerg fights. Because Spellbreaker has its fight-deciding Winds of Disenchantment, you'll often feel like your personal performance can have a big impact on the outcome of a fight. Additionally, you'll provide a great mix of DPS, boonstrip, and CC once you use your ultimate. 
---
Plus, you get to feel like a total badass as your dive into the enemy zerg and fuck shit up with your hammer and greatsword. 
---
Not a fan of LOTR style fantasy. Very happy with the story arcs in gw2 
---
I see it spawn everytime i'm in that zone without actively trying to spawn it funnily enough lmao
---
I’d give a kidney for half the gold the people in this thread seem to have to buy so many permanent utilities lmao
---
Forgot to state that this is a contest with a prize of 2000 gems. Fashion wars won't be okay for those who just started. We all just started this week heeee
---
What do people think is the best gem store salvage-o-matic? I have all 3, and used to flip between copper &amp; silver dependant on the item's rarity but since the runecrafter's one came out I've pretty much just used that one. I guess I'm trying to gauge whether it would actually be better for me to use the Copper instead, as I am overflowing with Lucent Motes... 
---
Is it hard to get? It'd be a perfect fit for my revenant but there are quite a few steps it seems.
---
Someone who truly understands the strenghts of the game would be great, sure the story instances are cool, but as far as MMOs go, it's really one of the worst types of content to prioritise, it's not replayable and it kills immersion of being in this big world when everyone is the chosen one
---
I think there was a ceiling cat in one of the vanilla dungeons
---
unfortunately sometimes in this game indicator culling is..well trash
---
while i don't have your specific problem, sometimes other raid boss aoes don't render for me..upping the graphics helps but it's not a guaranteed
---
what i would do besides trying to fix the graphics is simply follow whoever the tank is and try to stand exactly on their model..it might be annoying but it should work
---
Idk what this is about. I guess Ruby is on the spot to draw ppl back in.
---
Theoretically, SAB in its current state is a way to get two stat+agony infusions a month. If it weren't a festival, said infusions would be a *very* practical source of stat+ar.
---
Between that and ultra tryhard holographic super food, a permanent SAB pass would probably pay for itself relatively quickly.
---
get in Josh for that with a short time contract (so his health care thing is safe again and until he finds a new contractor that can keep him for long) and I dosh out for any world ;)
---
what is the red number under the character profession in fractals?
---
This comic was decent and had a decent punchline.
---
They probably can, however I recommend buying 2000 gem codes from CDKeys for about $22 each
---
The flamekissed light armor was changed but I doubt they will change this skin because you don't like the boots.
---

---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:How_to_Gear_a_Character#Ascended_Equipment
---
That should at least point you in the right direction
---
This model was clearly a baseline for Raptor. I wish they did it at release it as separate skin.
---
[I did this. Which models could end up being skins. Some are good, some quite bad.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Hansmith)
---
Legit? Hey that's a better deal
---
I’ve been doing this with ascended materials, especially because they’re time-gated. What other things do you craft to make a little profit? 
---
r/woooosh
---
Yeah I honestly think GW2 has a very unique set of dragons.  I think people on this sub have just gotten too used to them and forget how weird they are.
---
Eh, depends if you value time more than money. If you don't have to pay gold and it only takes you time to get, it's arguably free to some people.
---
I can't LFG for T4 though, I'm only personal level 58 and the last time I saw someone trying to shout in /map for a T4 group when they couldn't use LFG for themselves they got flamed really hard for it. Also I'm kind of broke as fuck at the moment, and don't have a lot of gold to buy the missing Agony Infusions nor do I currently have a means to obtain the missing Ascended slots besides the Shoulder.
---
Without the 5 slots I'm missing, I'd have to spend a bunch of money on +11s that I just can't afford to be able to meet AR for T4s. I don't know where else to get gold besides fractals, since there are almost never any Silverwastes groups when I'm on either. I'm starting to feel like I can't make it anywhere in the end game...
---
Pretty much
---
Outside of a guild run serpant's ire, or griffon stuff, people don't tend to spend a ton of time on Vabbi
---
Best options would be to see if you can get a group together before hand, or to hope that vabbi bounties are a daily
---
Just keep checking the stuff you buy yourself, if it only comes from crafting, that means someone else crafted it. And he most likely didn't do so out of charity. 
---
Takeaway quote regarding the future of SAB:

&gt; "The people in charge really like Super Adventure Box (...)

&gt;I have .... NO insight right now into *anything*... "

 Building beetle race tracks in the guild hall are super fun! Our guild \[RAWR\] on TC finally decided to get some teleportation decorations to make it easy to go anywhere in the hall without a hassle. So now I'm able to bring you sky tracks, one of the main reasons i wanted to move back to Guilded Hollow! :D The amount of places to build in here is almost limitless. The second track i made in the hall was a climb up to the roof and back down, but it kinda felt like more of a slow climb then the zoom zoom feel i wanted, so i didn't bother recording it :(  This track takes you from the sky above the roof of the hall all the way down to the ground floor.  Hopefully this one is much more enjoyable.

Havok's Heir is the airship in Gendarran Fields. The WvW one is Armistance Bastion, which is jam-packed with extra features (WvW team chat, dueling arena, etc.)
---
i didnt know it had to be in order.. derp
---
i did not :&lt;
---
Monk's outfit was updated a month after it came out because of terrible clipping and bad textures. Those boots in the outfit you posted will not get updated though. Many of those who bought the outfit actually like them.
---
That sometimes happens because of loading bugs. 
---
But it can also be caused by hacks that allow activating any skill by forcefully sending the message to activate it, and using NPC skills that cause effects like [Invisibility](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Invisibility).
---
This is honestly a great tactic, I mean not in the middle of a fight, but say if a commander goes down, you have other "drivers" to pick it back up and keep going.
---
They'll never redesign an old outfit, I don't think. Not in the way you're proposing. 
---
But I keep hoping that at some point one kind soul at Anet will add extra toes to all the asuran versions of the shoes in probably half of the outfits. Poor asura, having 2 toes always out in the open. 
---
I feel rewarded when I work hard for something.
---
Not when I wait 30 days because I can only do x amount of progress per day.
---
That's awesome. Reminds me of the turkey room in AC. 
---
Also, for those who don't know, there's a turkey room in AC and it's beautiful. 
---
Maybe some hidden field/browser code that is checking if you are human or robot?  Make sure you are allowing your browser to run JavaScript on the site.
---
Do you have the game installed on a Hard Disk Drive as opposed to an SSD?
---
It's possible if you have it installed on a low RPM HDD, and or the hard drive could possible be taxed by other applications running in the background of your computer (web browser/spotify/virus scanners, etc), that the resourced needed to show are loaded to late, and missed. If that were the case, turning up your graphics settings higher wouldn't help, but actually make it worse, as it would be over taxing your machine.

A significant amount of layoffs just happened. Now, people will tell you that this is either good (they can focus on GW2) or bad (company is bleeding). It's up to you to make your own call on that.
---
The game is decently populated, but nowhere near the amount of bigger MMORPGs (WoW, FF14). It's maybe on tier with ESO and OSRS. 
---
Due to the layoffs, as of now, only LWS5 is confirmed. We do not know if there is anything else in the works, such as Expansion 3. Anything beyond LWS5 is uncertain. 
---
Now is a hard time for the game, but we're sure to still get some content, and the game is still fun.
---
Thanks.
---
Roamers have to adapt? Yea like me I just dont play WvW anymore
---
Just want to weigh in and say that I've seen this happen to someone in a raid training a few months ago. Reloading the instance and such didn't work, and the trainee in question didn't have arc or any other addons/overlays. He sent screenshots so we knew he was actually getting a bug and not just covering for bad dodging lmao
---
Wouldn't surprise me if they were trying to hack, I've never seen that before.
---
Should I get 1 of this or wait for a copper fed discount? Only have 800 gems :(
---
Not really worried about the damage, the fucking invisible ranger was a bit of a concern though, you think?
---
Raid trainer here. Exotic is fine for training runs. Lacking Ascended, especially on DPS classes, isn't going to be the reason you fail runs in training. It's all mechanics and rotation before that ~6% dps increase even approaches relevancy.
---
I think the whole dragon plot was one of GW2's worst mistakes.
---
For Zhaitan, I guess it was ok. The risen were an army anyway. The dragons shouldn't have been forces of nature though, but characters with personality and goals. Zhaitan should have been able to talk and taunt us now and then.
---
We had many other options after GW2 vanilla:
---
* Lazarus leading the White Mantle and other sinister forces like the Inquest and the Nightmare Court.
---
* Primordus vs Jormag plot, where we could ally one or another in their struggle for power.
---
* Mysteries of the Bloodstones.
---
* Palawa Joko takes over Zhaitan's energies, and expands north to invade Tyria. We wake up Kralkatorrik and make them fight.
---
* Liberate Cantha from an evil emperor, who is sacrificing people to demons.
---
* Charr civil war far to the east of Ascalon.
---
And that's just using what we have. Even then, I think GW2 started really, really bad from a worldbuilding perspective. There's just nowhere to go, no stakes, no conflict, nothing.
---
We'd be happy to have you over at Raiders in Training.
---
Nevermind, 14. Counted wrong and got two after writing that 8 hours ago :)
---
We'd just have to fight people infected with Sea Dragon herpes instead of purple/blue crystal herpes, or lava crabs.
---
They’re pretty pathetic haha. If mortals from Tyria can kill 2/6 dragons, they should be able to too. Balthazar knows what’s up.
---
+ they can absorb the magic.
---
What a boring af video. 
---
&gt;They are characters with personalities and goals. Just because they don't think, and Tyrians believe them to be forces of nature, doesn't mean they're lacking personality and goal.
---
None of this is ever established in the game and expecting the audience to infer plot is pretty much the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do as a writer unless you're explicitly aiming for ambiguity.
---
Aside from a few lines from Mord about how resistance is futile, the Dragons behave exactly like wild animals. They have a single minded obsession with consuming resources and go about it in the most direct manner. They're no more complex than a dog that barrels through the kitchen, knocking a child over, to get to his food bowl.
---
He's not invisible, you even targeted him.  Your game just didn't load the player model. Pretty common, if your computer haven't enough ressources or takes longer to load everything. 
---
If that happens more often, try to set down some graphics, maybe use pvp standard models. 
---
However, that's not "fucking brocken" or even a hack, just a loading issue.
---
Yep definitely nothing wrong when you can't see another player in a competitive game mode. Sure.
---
If possible, I'd  suggest that people support the game or else there may not be a game to play.  That's just my personal opinion.
---
I'm just hanging around Shaemoor until this thing blows over. 
---
They're desynced, so they take 2s to render on your screen after coming out of stealth. It's a pretty cheap tactic
---
Figure as much. Thanks for the reply.
---
A note - i enjoyed Guard so much because i love blue and aegis abilities. Is there any class that can give me invulnerability or block often like guardian?
---
Thanks for sharing! Canon is such a nice song to play, and it's always fun to hear other people's take on it despite the problematic aspects of input lag. I'm glad that even some broken armor didn't stop you from spreading the joy of music around as far abroad as the Crystal Desert. :)
---
They fixed physics on several outfits. But never the design itself. Those boots are here to stay, Im afraid.
---
The Mursaat were probably Anet's best go at good villains.
---
-Extra dimensional (at the time) alien wizards
---
-Use their powers to subvert an entire nation of mortals and create a militaristic cult society with them at the center as gods
---
-Use that power to take people they think will lead to their downfall and trick them into being sacrificed on a magic battery
---
-Use the above mentioned battery to keep a hell portal closed so they don't get fucked up by an even bigger baddie
---
-All this subterfuge is needed because they are convinced a group of humans will rise up and kill them all so they hide their presence.
---
The White Mantle were also a great enemy because they were villains but genuinely thought serving the Unseen Ones was virtuous because they saved Kryta from certain doom at the hand of a Charr invasion.
---
It's the kind of fanaticism that can believably lead to normal men acting in a terrible way rather than just being copy pasta Orcs who are evil because.
---
Thanks! Needed a second confirmation/opinion!
---
or even the NPC who sells provisiner tokens for certain items
---
It is. At the end of the day legendaries or anything you want to get in this game are goals you set yourself, so once you accomplish them the work pays off :)! 
---
I'm a huge fan of LOTR style fantasy. I think that way too many games try to be "unique" by doing things that haven't been done before (there is usually a reason why it hasn't) or just taking things from a bunch of different cultures and mashing them together (TES). It's become so prevalent that I can't actually think of any recent games except LOTRO or even the middle earth games that have gone with a tolkien style of fantasy, yet that is what I constantly find myself craving and imagining while I play these "unique" games. I can't stand it when they just make weird elves, orcs and such because it's so obvious that they are making them weird just so they don't appear like tolkien style orcs and elves.

i had 7 already from over the years, today i bought another 10. i honestly struggled to find stuff to fill 17 slots but i managed to. it didnt occur to me to put gobblers in there tho, will do that later.
---
As someone who regularly roams in starting zones, new players population just increased significantly in this week.
---
Copperfed is still good even if it doesn’t stay in a shared slot, but a shared slot with nothing in it is useless
---
Hope you can get enough gems for both at some point tho

It's the Hoelbrak loading screen that has skyscrapers under construction and giant cranes melded into the mountain.

Just finished the last piece over the weekend, finally!

Next legendarys on my list:
---
- the Ascension (pvp back piece)
---
- heavy pvp armor
---
- aurora (LWS 3 trinket)
---
- bindings of Ipos (Generation 2 focus) 
---
On the right: it looks like a guy w his arms crossed wearing a blue shirt and black square glasses. 
---
I’ve played this game for years and this is the first time I’ve seen what looks like ppl on the LA loading screen. 
---
I honestly think it was a mistake putting Mordremoth so early on in the story, he's pretty much the only Elder Dragon who was able to talk (afaik) and communicate with us, and all he ever was reduced to was "You will bow before me muahahahahah" typicial villain dialogue. Would have been much more interesting if we tried to develop magitech to tame him and learn some Elder Dragon lore. These guys have been around since the beginning of Tyria pretty much and we killed the one founder who can communicate.
---
Skins you think are good ang looks pleasing
---
Non-gemstore stuff: 
---
"Mist Omnipotion, Position Rewinder, White Mantle Portal Device, LS3 Portal Tome, LS4 Portal tome, Unlimited/Limited Bank; merchant; TP; and repair contract.
---
You can also temporarily put in Unidentified gear so they aren't salvaged. 
---
eh i think its fine as a frontliner, wells to bomb, locust swarm&gt;spitefulshroud+stab armour and just spin to win... sure not as useful as a scourge; but far from useless
---
you don't even have to craft the vision crystal, you can get it for 6 sprockets that came from those black lion memory boxes or whatever the fuck they are called
---
the mortals just have plot armour feelsbadman
---
You guys know people take breaks? It’s not like op plats 1 hour a day since launch. Could be 4 hours a day and a 3 year break (no maths included).
---
(Red circle followed by purple lightning strike)
---
No but then again my reason for not buying more is a bit silly.
---
I made post in this reddit not too long ago with similar suggestions and was down voted to oblivion. This community is kind blind about how games and money work. 
---
Sir, where is your Ecto Gamble Gizmo? ( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o)
---
If it's on a timer, the wiki should have information about when it will happen, so you might start there
---
Are you EU?
---
I maxed out shared inventory slots during the last big sale. And now I find myself needing more of these. Tools, teleportation scrolls and tomes, MF food, salvage kits, primers, a couple of gizmos are just a few things I constantly keep there. I wish I could also have shared access to items needed for collections, junk eaters, and so on. That would be such a lovely QoL improvement!
---
If it wasn't for youtube guides, I'd literally have no idea what I'm doing. I'm level 80 and I still have no idea how to access or what I need for major parts of the game even with guides. I don't know how the Mystic Forge works or if it's even necessary to use it. I don't know where to even access raids or if I have access to them without HoT (the game suggests you do once you finish the personal story). I know where to access Fractals but I know next to nothing about them or if I need a certain gear level before I attempt them. I don't know how to earn money at a good enough rate to be able to afford mats for leveling my disciplines. And I'm sure these even more stuff I don't even know that I don't know. The tutorialization in this game is absolutely awful.
---
It's going to be subjective, but I think there are actually very few bad skins in the game. Even the low-level plain-looking stuff can be a good Foot Soldier aesthetic and can be mixed in with flashier stuff. I'm a fan of the Carapace armor set from the Silverwastes which you get just for going through the map events over time. The armor pieces you get from the elite specs also usually look really cool (particularly the dragonhunter's gloves)
---
No. I spend wisely and have 13000gold and 4 wives irl. 
---
Thanks for the reply and for your kind words; I'm glad you've found the discussion enjoyable. I wouldn't view you "trying to shit on the game"; it's healthy to provide constructive and articulated criticism on any subject, and games are no exception. I'm personally interested in how people perceive stories and their inherent and admittedly subjective "quality", so your comments have been nice to read with that in mind. I also agree with dividing the narrative into plot, dialogue and lore as I've had a similar division in mind. :)
---
As for the dragons and their often subtle narrative hints, ArenaNet has had a curious tendency to downplay their personalities in game (and even in the novels aside from breadcrumbs) perhaps because they themselves are unsure how to approach the dragons as antagonists or because of how "alien" the dragons are as they haven't had to relate to what they consider "lesser" races (and why Glint's being freed from corruption and choosing to side with the lesser races was such a huge deal and proof, alongside other "good" dragons like Albax and Kuunavang from GW1) that dragons and mortal races can coexist peacefully if given a chance.
---
We do get a bit more insight into Glint and even Kralkatorrik's past in actual main story missions via PoF's "Crystalline Memories" and "The Way Forward" memory crystals/pedestals and particularly in "Scion &amp; Champion" lair instance in S4Ep5 All or Nothing where Glint reveals to the Pact Commander Kralkatorrik's greatest secret which motivated Kralk to act in such an evil manner throughout history:
---
&gt; **Glint:** With you, Champion, I share my true legacy—and Kralkatorrik's greatest secret.  
---
&gt; **Glint:** He foresaw the possibility of a world at peace. A world without strife between dragons and mortals. A world without him.  
---
&gt; **Glint:** It terrified him. He demanded I help prevent it from coming to pass.  
---
&gt; **Glint:** But where he saw doom, I saw a gift to the world.  
---
&gt; **Glint:** I believe in this future—this fragile, powerful hope. But what my daughter must do will seem impossible to her.  
---
This reveals a few things about Kralk's personality which aligns with his destructive, vengeful and greedy nature as depicted in the novel. Via this secret we learn that he has Glint and Aurene's prophetic abilities, and he foresaw a future without strife between races, a world without him (which is ambiguous enough that it could mean that he dies or otherwise becomes insignificant, and he doesn't like either option). This vision prompted him to act the way he did, causing a chain reaction which would lead to Forgotten freeing Glint from his control which in turn led to the Legacy plan in which Glint and her scions would replace him and other Elder Dragons in the cosmic system of the All, thus it all contributing to a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy ironically enough.
---
It also adds a level of tragedy to Kralk's story to explain at least some of his villainy in game: if only he had not viewed himself superior to "lesser" races and opened his mind to mortals like Glint eventually did instead of being terrified by a would-be event in a vision he believed would come to pass, and if he was less greedy, he could've become a great boon to the world rather than a villain everyone but his brainwashed minions loathe. Then again, Glint's explanation in the same story instance also hints at the Elder Dragons being victims of the hunger as the magic they consume is addictive and leads to abuse of power. Essentially "with great power comes great responsibility":
---
&gt; **Glint:** You will see, Scion, that absorbing magic comes naturally. But the power, its temptations...they exact a price.  
---
&gt; **Glint:** Champion, this magic is powerful and dangerous. Share the burden so she can absorb it.  
---
&gt; **Glint:** Good. Power has many uses, Scion. By choosing to share it and heal wounds, you strengthen your bond with mortals.  
---
&gt; **Glint:** Remember that bond. As the power grows, so will the dangers. And the temptations.  
---
&gt; **Glint:** More powerful still, and more dangerous...  
---
&gt; **Glint:** Well done. When Elder Dragons gorge on magic with abandon, the world falls out of balance. We have no choice but to act.  
---
&gt; **Glint:** To use power responsibly is to know when and how to share it—and when not to use it at all.  
---
There definitely could be more, but these reveals do help flesh Kralk out and add some relatability to his motivations as a character while teasing him being an addict to magic alongside other Elder Dragons who simply can't control their urges while they pursue their vision of what THEIR ideal world would be like. Perhaps it's the writers' worry on how to tackle Kralk's alien thought processes without humanizing him too much that makes them choose the careful approach when fleshing him out. If they ever let him speak (or if he in his arrogance ever deems it necessary to attempt to communicate with lesser beings) like they did with Mordremoth, it would also help give him some personality as a villain.
---
The reason for the perceived "shallowness" of Glint's past is that ultimately ancient history with the previous dragonrise isn't that relevant to the current storyline which is more about forgiving each other and teaming up with power of friendship to tackle greater threats. While Glint still operates as a ghost for the time being, GW2's story has shown that, just like Destiny's Edge, the past will make way for the future which manifests as Dragon's Watch and Aurene (depending on where they take her story from here). One could certainly add more lore about the pasts of this or that character, but the living world format has a limited budget regarding word use and localization, so the writers have to choose their battles and what lore to consider more relevant to the ongoing storyline. Thus we get teases with Glint and Trahearne's complex pasts etc. but don't explore them in detail. What they do is common worldbuilding, but they also want to be somewhat vague IF they ever decide to explore this or that plot point in more detail later on. Thus they didn't reveal more about Rytlock's Mists adventure until they decided that his key moments in the Mists were learning to be a revenant from Glint and freeing Balthazar, which they may not have been able to do if they had already elaborated on everything that happened to Rytlock in the Mists (and we still don't know the full story and why Rytlock is reluctant to share that info even with the Black Citadel until he was forced to without us witnessing it).
---
As for the mentor deaths on Claw Island, canonically all three mentors sacrificed themselves there, so it wasn't just one mentor's job. While we've never been told the specifics of how each of them contributed to holding off the Risen (and I do feel this is where the story could've improved but admittedly it would've required more elaborate setup and exposition to describe how their field of expertise contributed to our escape), they bought the rest of us enough time to escape with our lives to lick our wounds and plan a counterattack. While it could've been anyone performing the sacrifice, it being the mentors made thematic sense for the plot: 1) via their bonding with the Commander, they learned a valuable lesson in life and had renewed purpose which they decided to put to good use by saving as many people they could, 2) their deaths would make the war against Zhaitan personal for the Commander (and the player by extension), 3) them leaving the story would give room for Trahearne to take their place and lead both Trahearne and the Commander to their destiny. I would say the plot and the dialogue in the Claw Island arc in this instance is sound, but where it lacked was in execution (or dramatization as you called it) and telegraphing the necessity of the sacrifice, which made the final product's scene look a bit clunky to players.
---
I'm somewhat curious of the "5 mins worth of dialogue" bit with the mentors; we do get quite a few interactions with them in the prior order arcs which help flesh them out adequately as they each tackle their respective problems differently based on the other orders' mentors (especially if you read their written and not just voiced dialogue in each mission), so it really shouldn't feel like they were just tacked on at the last minute. But the fact it did seem like that to you is quite curious although it may be the lack of pointing out that written dialogue is just as crucial to character development than just the voiced dialogue in cutscenes/during missions. Although it would've been welcome to do more with the mentors (and to be fair, the order arc always felt a bit short as we rose through ranks too quickly, which is admittedly a problem of the overly ambitious and branching nature of personal story narrative), they nevertheless received more development than the likes of Blish from S4 ever did just by the screentime they had.

Good question! Focus is primarily a single target weapon and axe also has high single target DPS. So running scepter(which has 2 aoe) with focus instead of daggers spreads out the aoe and single target skills. Plus when you go into axe, you would typically be in melee range(for axe 3) which makes landing your dagger 5 easier. In scepter you don't have to be in the enemy zerg to maximise your corrupts and DPS; so running scepter/focus fits with the archetype, at least in my opinion.

I wouldn't say Eir's death was uncalled for per se although I can see how folks would view it that way. Devs explained that Eir's death was deliberate to set up the stakes of the Maguuma campaign and show how no one was safe Game of Thrones style, thus adding tension over whether the rest of Destiny's Edge and Trahearne would survive in Mordremoth's grip. Eir had already admitted in personal story, and even during her suicidal run through Honor of the Waves, that her time as a hero had passed and she was ready to hand over the mantle to the norn Hero and later to Braham, making her an Obi-Wan mentor to Braham's Luke, essentially. She joined the Maguuma mission out of obligation to the Pact and to finish the Elder Dragon hunt the Pact and the guild had begun. As such, her death helped hammer in how dangerous Mordremoth was, motivate Braham to avenge her death, cause Rytlock to deem Destiny's Edge to no longer exist as a guild, and eventually lead to the friction between Braham and the Commander (which could've been done better in S3).
---
Given this framework, however, I would've improved the narrative by having Eir put up a bigger fight despite being severely weakened and have the Vinetooth not be a random elite mook but a recurring lieutenant of Mordremoth (possibly with mesmer powers to masquerade as Eir to initially fool the Commander and company in a later confrontation) to add up the danger level similar to how the Shadow of the Dragon was used in S2, and thus give us the satisfaction of defeating this Vinetooth in place of Faolain in the penultimate instance after it had been harrassing us throughout the campaign.
---
The Zhaitan fight had great setup as the entire latter half of the personal story was dedicated to researching his powers, strategy and weaknesses and using this knowledge against him, culminating in the cleansing of the Artesian Waters and the assault on Arah. It was like watching lines of dominoes fall all the way towards the end with each fall contributing to the outcome. Aside from the rushed final battle which was meant to have a second phase on ground based on hints, various racial and order branches as well as dungeons foreshadowed the research needed to develop the MEGA-LIT cannon that took down Zhaitan (e.g. introducing Gorr in asura personal story, which unfortunately had the Trahearne effect of not every player being as familiar with Gorr and Trahearne as they should've been and thus some solutions appearing as if they came out of nowhere when they had been established in the asura and sylvari branches of the story already, thus my comment about the personal story being a "diamond in the rough" in execution despite its ambitions). Even the fight itself, while rushed, had the visual spectacle of flying over Arah past rows of giants, battling dragon champions and facing the weakened Elder Dragon in its glory.
---
Braham's issues in S3 were troublesome indeed as they were countered by his feelings post-Mordremoth death in HoT finale (if you spoke to him and the other allies in the instance after beating the final mission). While his grief makes sense, him blaming the Commander for Eir's death was less so, and sadly the writers haven't elaborated on that beyond comparing Braham's feelings to a grieving human's. Perhaps his growing aggression was a result of being with toxic friends (Destiny's Edge 2.0) or Jormag fueling his hate in the north, but it's sadly not as well explored as it should've been. His "redemption" in S4 has made sense after being forced to team up with the Commander to save Taimi, foil the Inquest's plans and combat a lich king who threatened his and the Commander's nations, and finally meeting Eir's ghost face to face and hearing from her to let go of the past and move forward. The way it's been told has been quite natural, and I wish the same treatment had been afforded for him in S3 instead of manufacturing it back then for the sole reason of drama and separating the Commander from their allies for a setup for PoF prologue. The planned plot itself in Braham's arc isn't bad per se, IMHO, and neither is his dialogue (unless you have some specific examples for it), but the execution of that plot for S3 could've been done better with a bit of tweaking to explain his sudden and unearned aggression towards us.
---
I'm somewhat curious that you feel the plot is terrible. If we look at the plot as it is, the stories they tell do have excitement and merit although the execution (the key word here, I feel :P) is lacking due to rushed development which forces them to cut corners at times.
---
A quick plot synopsis:
---
In base game we're introduced to various characters and subplots as we learn more about our culture's nuances and the shrouded past of our mentors and their own troubles with their guilds. We end up learning about the threat of the dragons and join one of the orders, befriending and losing a mentor before gaining a new friend from the reclusive scholar Trahearne. We return from our setback and drive back the dragon's forces and we and Trahearne help each other persevere as we successfully convince the orders to join forces while gaining valuable allies in the process before we take the fight to the dragon's territory and unite our racial mentors' guild, all of it culminating in the first defeat of an Elder Dragon in millennia.
---
Our victory comes crashing down in S2 and HoT once the twist about the sylvari's origins as dragon minion sleeper agents is revealed and how the next dragon we face is even more cunning than the previous one, resulting in more sacrifices and deaths until we defeat that threat while having to go through several sylvari betrayals along the way with our trust in them temporarily shaken (and with the plot becoming more personal if we play through HoT as a sylvari as Mordremoth's voice becomes more compelling the closer we get to him).
---
S3 introduces us to the fallout of Mordremoth's death, the birth of a future dragon savior we begin to bond with since our adventure in S2 and HoT, and the rising threats of the divided White Mantle factions, an ancient villain returning and attempting to work with us, the reveal of this "redeemed" villain being an imposter who turns out to be one of the Six Gods who is attempting to accomplish our goal of killing the dragons to seemingly save Tyria as well as the reveal of another human villain Caudecus having been the mastermind behind many of the plots in personal story. The big twist ends up being that we can't kill dragons anymore as their deaths will destroy Tyria, so we have to face a god (which is worse if we play as human as we end up having a crisis of faith going against one of our deities) and stop him while sacrificing a chance to destroy or weaken the dragons with a machine we'd spent some of S2, HoT and S3 setting up. We face crises among our own guild, essentially leaving us to face the god alone without even knowing if all the gods are working together to kill the dragons regardless of consequences and if we can even get any help to stop them, let alone find ways to even defeat gods who may be superior in power to the dragons.
---
PoF takes us to a historically rich land which is facing a triple threat from an empowered Elder Dragon, a god and a lich king. Trying to navigate the complex political landscape while dealing with each of these opposing and ambitious villains and their armies while learning that at least the god's and the lich's armies are sympathetic, we reunite with some allies, meet with a more friendly god, and discover ancient mysteries that shed light on the overarching narrative of the game before we get killed in what is yet another twist. We return from the dead and use one villain's army to defeat another army while facing a third army and its dragon master all the while trying to stop one of the villains from killing the other in a headscratcher of a finale that ends on a big cliffhanger.
---
Which leads us to S4 which fleshes out some of the plotlines while elaborating how we can defeat the Elder Dragons without destroying the world: we replace the evil dragons with more benevolent balancers of magic in a win-win scenario. We just need to figure out how to do so now that the remaining dragons are powered up with one dragon in particular having grown so powerful as to enter the Mists where it will grow too powerful to be stopped. We amass an army of everyone we've ever encountered from personal story to S4 for a final stand against this dragon...only to lose horribly with no hope left, leaving the Commander with no plan for the first time ever.
---
On paper all of this sounds like some pretty intriguing fantasy stuff right there with twists and turns and several recurring villains and heroes for various plot arcs. I would call many of these plot lines good, at least in theory, as some of these lack in execution despite the ambitions (e.g. the needlessly complex and chronologically confusing spy game subplot for Balthazar for S3 and only hinting at his benevolent side in some side conversations instead of selling him as a more complex character than the raging gloryseeker he turned out to be). I could easily see these plots turning into rather fascinating novels rivaling the scope and complexity of the likes of Lord of the Rings, A Song of Ice and Fire etc. but which are more limited in game form due to everything being related to gameplay and forcing the narrative to adapt to such (so we can't have that many instances of character development without adding combat scenes in between to keep the gameplay interesting, for example).
---
What GW2 lacks in its narrative are more complex, even morally grey antagonists aside from one-offs like Gavin from the sylvari White Stag storyline. We've thankfully had a few of these lately with the villain-turned-antihero Zafirah (a surviving priestess of Balthazar whose role becomes greater as the narrative progresses once she learns to forgive our involvement in her god's demise), Aurene turning out to be a flawed hero rather than the paragon we expected her to be, and turning many of the formerly villainous Awakened into our allies when we have to set aside our differences to defeat Kralkatorrik who threatens all of us all the while resolving the Elonian politics plot about how to govern the nation via several rival political parties after the threat of Joko has been dealt with. The recent [Requiem short story for Rytlock](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Requiem:_Rytlock), if you're interested in reading it, even potentially teases a future charr storyline involving Rytlock's old flame and children while setting up the Blood Legion Imperator as an intriguing figure from Rytlock's past and explaining some long-standing questions like how exactly Rytlock acquired Sohothin to begin with.
---
Thanks for your input and taking your time to read my ramblings. I'm beginning to see where you're coming from, and I feel the reason for such feelings may be because of GW2's deliberate approach on a specific type of storytelling and how it limits is scope can cause some friction for some players.
---
There's definitely a lot that GW2 narrative could do better, but the foundations themselves are solid with a lot of potential if only they decide to flesh stuff out and make some of the pure good vs. evil stuff more nuanced with more development for characters to make us care for both the heroes and villains even more in the long run. :)
---
It's reassuring to read that I'm not alone in the delay of making a legendary (I'm still yet to do it). Might have. To put a concentrated effort and make a proper list to get one done.

Need more !

It would help if we had a race, gender and price range to work with. “Cheap” is really subjective. For me anything under 50g I’d consider cheap, but for a lot of players that’s expensive. 
---
i already finished that bounty achievement a long time ago, so i just trash encoded orders, but i didnt know it did anything, i will look into keeping one.
---
dang xd i took the pic before i got the 5 slots. so now 11 spare slots, idk what to do with it. lol
---
oooh i need to put food in there. cuz rn i have 11 slots and i've no idea what to do with it. lol. thank you!
---
Been playing for 750 hours, 2 years, and did legendary armor, ad infinitum and aurora, last week. Working toward the bifrost. 
---
If you plan on doing aurora, start as soon ad you can because there is a ton of time gated achievs
---
you could just get the perma bank? xd but that QoL would be nice to have! mmm.  
---
i have the opposite problem though. idk what to put there. lol. if i'm gonna wvw, i'll drop some food from the bank in my shared slots.  
---
or if i gather something, i'd switch those normal tools out for the unlimited ones. or leave some spaces so i could trade stuff between characters. so it's never a need to put a lot of things in the share slot xd

If the episode packs don't get an additional discount this month there is still a chance that they will be discounted during the anniversary sale in August

I need to buy 5 because that is the best price but if I do that my bags would no longer be aligned in my inventory window ...
---
&gt; i honestly struggled to find stuff to fill 17 slots but i managed to
---
I wish I had this problem.  The more I buy, the more junk I find to put in shared slots.
---
Yeah I know, the druid back. But even if I finish it I won't finish the story achievements, which are needed for the collection (at least the skins you get for completing the achievements) too, any time soon. So I'm not in a hurry with the back piece ;) 
---
Catch 22. There are plenty that would be up in arms saying it should be free. There would be riots

We need Pinstripe Potoroo here
---
5 target Cap bruh
---
Many of the SAB fans would, but ArenaNet is unlikely to ever do that for one simple reason.
---
SAB is a unique piece of content (mostly for the better, but in this instance that works against it) that was created years ago with an engine designed to do something completely different that what SAB is.
---
So, having it come back once a year, they only need to make sure it works when it comes back. However, if they added such passes to the game that allowed it to be accessible outside of that window they now have to keep making sure that SAB is always in a working condition throughout the year.
---
So, rather than have once a year maintenance cost to bring it back they would now have a continuous maintenance cost that they need to keep paying to make sure SAB never breaks because of future content updates.
---
Also, pretty sure the in-game rewards that affect the rest of GW2 would need to be re-evaluated if SAB became a truly permanent fixture through such passes.
---
Budget or all-out? You can achieve a lot with 3-5 gen i7, 16gigs of ram (ddr4 preferred, but ddr3 is just fine if you go older gen cpu), ssd, any nvidia gfx like 970 and up (not exactly for gw2 just to have), do not go for Z chipset if you are not going to overclock to same some $.
---
If you have more cash to spend. just go for everything in same area just newer gen.
---
Honestly I'm surprised anyone who isn't monetising their videos (and therefore forced to use comments because of engagement metrics) actually wades into the cesspool of YouTube comments at all.

If I was a game dev or similar they would be off on every video

&gt; material storage expander
---
where do u find the upcoming changes?
---
They are already on sale, no? 
---
i agree. that would be very nice. like i don't understand how it's not a standard. lol
---
Granted, you’ll get 3 Black Lion Keys, a Sigil of Nullification and a few good boosters, but you could stop at the 64 level reward (that gives the Sigil) and buy a Pact Weapon off the Trading Post for less than 7 Gold. Save yourself some time. Doing the whole Personal story to 80 is not worth a Weapon less than 7 Gold but to each their own. 
---
And on the other hand, we have a full blown content monetization - only 1 available skin per mount for the paid expansion. 30€ wasn't much to pay, but I expected at least a few "free" skins.
---
I wish I could put a Candy gobbler in one of these slots... Please Anet bring it back !
---
Gw2 is not dead but its definitely past its prime.
---
It lags for everyone when you mass open/salvage gear or open blcs or other item containers
---
&gt; Am really interested how can you even spend 14 slots
---
Lounge pass, Season 3 tome, Season 4 tome, generic condi utility, generic power utility, generic food, omnomberry food for farming, copper salvage-o-matic, runecrafter salvage-o-matic, black lion salvage kit (just cuz nowadays, used to have a bank consumable there), revive orbs, instant armor repair kit, merchant consumable, and one for spare things such as collection items.

the old "more oozes" trick. I like it. I remember fun times with my friend back in the days. Like duoing Lupi with additional oozes
---
Imagine if Sherlock's rival was a thunderstorm instead of Moriarty.
---
Imagine if Harry's inevitable battle was with a volcano instead of Voldemort.
---
Imagine if Luke's burden was to fight a blizzard instead of his own father.
---
That's how I feel about Elder Dragons.
---
Sounds like a typical Hizen video, to be honest.
---
I remember jumping into a small pipe and swimming through drainage tunnels, I'd love to go there again. 
---
No, quite the opposite in fact. I want more big dragon war fights instead of the disjointed soap opera we're getting instead.
---
Even the fights we **do** get, like K now, are all distinct momentary small fights made entirely chaotic due to NPCs talking over each other while fighting and a sea of blinding spell effects.
---
There's 0 narrative effort in it, and it shows. It's just thrown together on a low budget, since in itself it makes no money. And the overarching plot doesn't ever come together since we forcibly have to change context every release with the zones.
---
I’ll give you the timed quartz crystals. Those are a pain. As for ingots. If you can farm all the mats necessary you can farm a bit more for paying for the complete version as well. It’s a simple trade off between time vs gold. Happens all the time. As for events. Enough event timers out there which let you plan most of the events on 1 or 2 days and even if it’s more, we are talking about a legendary item not some masterwork thingy. 
---
Oh I did it on my ele, after a long break from game, and had my arse handed to me *so* many times! It was definitely a tough fight.

if your EU pm me your username il do it for you

I'm a returning player and looking to get back into PvP again -- I last played the game mode actively around the HoT days. The problem is, I'm a very nervous person, especially when I'm not used to something, and while I loved playing Thief in sPvP people have always seemed very extra unforgiving to thieves who don't play perfectly. Is there an 'easy' or more forgiving profession I can play while I get used to the game mode and get some confidence? I have a few character slots open so I don't mind having to roll something entirely new. I like very offensive DPS playstyles, but I also played a healer for like... 10 years in another MMO so I'm definitely not opposed to something more supporty.
---
Thanks, and sorry that this is probably a common question!
---
No, it's anet's shortsighted development.
---
$5 says the final boss fight is playing a game of Go Fish against Kralk in the Hall of Heroes.
---
\&gt; We'll show how to get your first mount and play through Living World  Season 4, pointing out helpful features and updates along the way.  
---
Step 1: Buy the expansion.
---
I came back recently and haven't bought it and now seeing this I'm wondering if I'm not part of some kind of massive mountless parasitic swarm. I quit when it came out because I didn't want to buy it. Came back for the core game. 
---
Not really. Changing the design of something purchased with gems, is asking for many many people to want a refund due to the change. When more likely they were bored of the outfit anyway and want something else.
---
No worries. Thanks for the offer though.
---
See, u actually thought the final process was a bit underwhelming. Yes, I was excited to head to the forge with all the bits, I was very happy to equip it and run around and stow/draw etc, love having the thing every day.
---
However, I thought it was a bit flat how it just pops out of the forge with nothing to make it different to if you were melting rares. I don't expect a worldwide broadcast like with EQ2 mythicals but maybe a popup telling you about the lore behind the weapon or something? 
---
I dunno. It was just a bit 'oh, thanks for the stuff here's your leg, bye'
---
I said this when the only endgame enemies in the game were Risen, and then again when everything was a dumb plant. I think we should just kinda be okay with it. Come to terms with the fact that it is what it is.
---
Polymock with minis would be great.  I don't ever use them, but this would give me areason.
---
Arrow Carts were great for wall defense before those nerfs.
---
You start a stack there. So if you open them (with a level 50~ character for t2 material, if it applies) you leave one in the slot so you don't have to think about it &amp; it autodeposits there
---
For me the balance team killed it. 
---
PvP was way more popular when it was completely barebones with no meaningful rewards, no infrastructure, nothing. Why then? Because it was fun to play and the game had a high skill cap.
---
2 expansions of powercreep later nothing remains of what this game once was. We have automated tournaments, a proper division systeam with seasons, decent rewards, etc but everything is just a spamfest and nothing feels fun to play against. I used to duel with friends for hours every day before HoT, I barely log in these days.
---
Had the game launched with the systems we have now maybe GW2 e-sport wouldn't have become a meme.
---
Fire the balance team and cull the powercreep, that's the only way forward. Obviously that's never gonna happen.
---
Gz, but I'd really want to know the amount of hours played. Because if you've been playing since launch, never took breaks off the game and have about 10k+ hrs on the game and this is your 1st legendary, I'd be really impressed.
---
all but 1 log links are broken.  
---
the \ before _sloth is wrong.
---
So Like in guildwars 1?
---
Probably not very different from most other peoples, I like doing Dungeons and Fractals, just messing around soloing champions. Spending a bunch of time in living world maps equipping my 20 something lvl 80's, and doing a lot of runs for music boxes. 
---
Only difference is I'm good at making gold. 
---
Nobody believes you, that you put the weebmusic only as a meme Tim :)
---
But the Elder Dragons ARE rolling natural disasters, the only one who has been shown to have a bit of personality is Kralky with the “he is scared of a future without elder dragons” so it makes sense that they are portrayed that way.
---
They could fix it if the battlements would prevent all enemy fire in the first place. Thus, the enemy zerg HAS TO siege the walls down to come through. 
---
Scrapper is currently one of the easiest and strongest builds. It's pretty tanky and hard to fail with. Check godsofpvp.net and metabattle for some guides about roles and more info about builds (builds might be outdated though). 
---
Just keep squeezing that stone. Maybe some more blood will come out.
---
No, they are worthless if you don't use them in crafting. 
---
Yeah well history didn't have pulls, wells and sand shades did it??
---
What if we give a non-strippable damage reduction property to anyone standing on the walls vs damage sourced from outside the walls? The walls are supposed to provide protection to the defenders. What if they did? 
---
Sorry, I'm very new to this game, and to this character.  While I appreciate it, your comment has almost no meaning without context.  Can you expand this a bit?
---
Steve
---
You can immediately tell that the SC build is inferior because it doesn't use superior rune of mercy.
---
&gt; You cant really realible and frequently balance game with tons of stats to work with. It take a year rework an elite spec thus making it OP someway like recent Super tanky scrapper.
---
LoL has far more variables in balance yet they manage to make serious changes over two-week time frames.   
---
It's not a question of ability, it's a question of priorities. Anet simply don't bother. 
---
Are you trying to start shit Ineluki? 
---
Walls are not for use unless at all anymore. If you move on the walls whilst a blob attack them you will simply be murdered. For some people it takes about 10000000 deaths to understand that whilst others get it faster. One of the things that made taking/defending keeps stale and boring since people rely more on siege then anything else. Walls are simply death traps, and even more so with the teleport to your lootbag bug.
---
That would be intresting (if it only applied to owning server of the walls).
---
I think the shift would turn lot of defense into wall-wars. 
---
* Enemy zerg would be able to free cast more
---
* Even more room for error - currently Eles, Staff necros, Rangers(lol) can attack walled people with ease.
---
* Enemy in walls already has ability to dodge or run back down to heal and get out of combat
---
* Enemy would have to bait other zerg to fight in walls to get clear advantage
---
Id say, despite cons, it could be intresting **if** it would be T3 passive and not just any tier. Or add it to "iron guards" tactic. And "iron siege" would apply it to arrow cart users for example so Iron siege wouldnt be even more useless.
---
All griffons do that. I dislike the icebrood version the most, because they in addition also chill you for 10 years.  
---
  
---
Seriously. The griffons are dead. Can this chill please wear off so I can move on?!
---
Yeah I just noticed it the most with the Branded ones because there are so many of them in the "new" maps.
---
scourge, firebrand, holo and scrapper
---
balance team, fucking joke
---
It's more so two different flavors. Teapot's is built for assuming downstates, SC's is built for preventing those in the first place.
---
If you want walls to shield you against those kind of attacks, then the enemies need to be able to use ladders to assault them.
---
Not that I'm against it, it could be pretty cool if done right.
---
It has 3 target cap per hit (x24), but it can hit a lot more than 5 targets.
---
Don‘t try to hide it
---
If your 60 man zerg can't figure out how to desiege against 5 people, you don't deserve it.
---
so much this... it's even worse, IF u try to shoot from the walls with a bow, the freaking wall itself in many if not most cases OBSTRUCTS your shot, while the poopy condispam/magic circles actually can hit you still.   
---
also catapult-hits on the wall can dmg u standing inside behind your wall. i yesterday had this trying to repair the wall, 48.800 dmg with one hit, oookay.  
---
walls should: block out a % of enemy range projectile dmg, make u unpullable, be untargetable for these red circle shit (alternatively, give a good amount of dmg% reduction from spells/condi stuff, or at least let range classes fire normally ( while yeah, a dmg nerf on many of the ranged classes would also not hurt overall.)
---
In wvw it gets up to 30-40k which is pretty high considering that average dps is around 4k. Players also have higher armor than mobs and pve groups use more dmg boosts so it's at least 50k when fully buffed.
---
Some areas in SMC can't be desieged like third floor.
---
Yes it's true, the ascended recipes for Zehtuka's gear are quite expensive on the trading post, so you'll save money by stat swapping gear with a cheaper recipe. Any core stat that you can buy from the master craftsman or guild trader will do.
---
You can use exotic trinkets in the meantime, but without slotted upgrades, the stats are significantly lower than their ascended versions. Some easier ones are the Amnoon/Sunspear/Joko backpack collections, amulet from PoF act 2 mastery achievement, and a difluorite ring and accessory from Sandswept Isles. 
---
And we have to get something to the table: how well do you know the class?? So take time not just doing what others do, but to study the builds and try to understand them, because it is really just a matter of changing some stuff/skills/traits, and you can play both builds, because they're quite the same. And change what you need depending on the encounter/fight.
---
This is awesome thing u guys do. Have up.
---
Yeah, GW1 had really interesting plots and themes going on. GW2 feels like a huge downgrade from that.
---
* Factions had the whole "plague epidemy" and "unite warring enemies against a common threat" things going on. It was the weakest of the 4 campaigns, but it got better later on with the Ministry of Purity.
---
* Nightfall portrayed a demon invasion in one of the best ways I've seen in fantasy. The politics of the Elonian nations were interesting as well.
---
* Eye of the North is a genuinely good journey into the wild, with lots of new factions and races to meet. A pretty good re-telling of the classic "gather allies and save the world" theme.
---
Extra credits to the dev team for skills that require no LoS like guard focus(?), scourge torch and some ranger bird bullshit.
---
And the aoe spam gets so bad you just get instagibbed when touchin it.
---
It gives you that tingling in your fingers that you need to hit your rotation in a stroke like motion
---
There is no objective in WvW that can be defended by 5 people vs 60 attackers unless those attackers are idiots. You need a different commander or a different game.
---
What kind of sorcery... 
---
+1
---
I agree with this. But I think ladders have to be a construction that you have to build in a base and push to a keep.  (Risk reward)
---
Yeah, i use gw2 timer :D 
---
thank you!
---
Underated kill.
---
Check out the WvW Livestream - they've done plenty. I'd like to see ONE where the devs try to defend a wall. They don't do defending because they're just roamers! They don't have any attachment to the upgrading of structures.
---
Also put in s3 and s4 tomes for easy travel
---
This is a great post. Thank you for this. I really enjoyed watching some of these videos!
---
The notion of walls in WvW is to get the stronger sides (attackers) into positions where weaker sides have a chance to defeat them.
---
In other words, the idea is to try to equalise uneven fights - and it works, to a degree.
---
The tools make perfect sense. I harvest flax with a bunch of characters and just being able to double click to swap tools is a massive QoL improvement. Before I used to have to go to my guild hall to switch.
---
As for what to put in there, well, it's not just what you need every day, but stuff you might need. So TP to friend stones are good, as are Portal Tomes, or the Lounge passes. Leaving UnID'ed gear there is also good because any new stuff you get will go to the shared inventory, so it won't get salvaged when you "salvage all". This may not be relevant in the post-March 26th update though.
---
It's working on Chrome and old now
---
&gt; Shields can block long range attacks easily.
---
For the third time, only if the attackers are idiots. A shield on the ground inside the wall/gate can't block treb shots that land in front of the wall/gate and damage the wall/gate with splash damage. Shields on top of the wall *can* block treb shots that land in front of the wall/gate, but those shields can be easily eliminated with ballistae/catas/ACs.

Jup got ranked effortlessly 1700 with a 6 matches with a mate 4 alone and we were only doodling around, testing new builds and such. Of course we are both not bad players but being able to call for help or secure there / this fight is safe, gives you alot.
---
Thanks for critiqe.
---
Well, the portal is nowhere near Mesmer. It mimics your abilities, you can't use it to tp.
---
As for Kalla's Fervor, you no longer get the passive buffs - Ferocity and Condition Damage. It's now a usable resource that enhances your skills and Core Legend Elites (if traited). You lose the stacks once you consume them. You gain then not by attacking but using skills.
---
True, however, that could also be perceived as a symptom of them not being able to monetize other kinds of content effectively. In other words they have to double down on what little they know works, at the cost of player friendliness.
---
Yes, but you'll find that p/p and using only 3 is pretty bad DPS. 5111, on the other hand, is not.
---
&gt; any other ideas before I try reinstalling?
---
Try repairing the client first.

[Here](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/201863008-Repairing-the-Game-Client) is the support page about how it's done.

Órders from Above. Which boons?
---
I wasn't surprised. They have been going on a murder spree through the list of Guild Wars 1 characters who are still alive for a while. Rest in peace Balthazar, you deserved better.
---
Weren't they working on something about Switzerland and tournaments?
---
Well couldn't buy anymore :-(
---
Yeah I know about them! But I want to cast Flesh Worm and summon a necrotic, clockwork worm from the ground. It's just a thematic change, but it would be fun! All style, same old substance.
---
I thought of things that are taken away from traits; 
---
- Retaliation
---
- Regeneration
---
It could give some Alacrity as well, but the main point is to build up Kalla's Fervor to increase the power/number of effects. 
---
By default it would be just Stunbreak + Retaliation, but once you have Kalla's Fervor, you'd get Regeneration (2-3 stacks), if you use it with 5 stacks, you get all of the above + Alacrity.
---
Insults. Clever. Yes, I play. On Blackgate no less. But since you don’t appear to understand my frame of reference and would instead prefer a reductive “get gud” diatribe over actual conversation, I’m going to assume we have nothing to talk about. Enjoy your Sunday.

If they're going for the 'corrupted' route too, they could at least be free-willed but under control of a Tyrant.
---
That's kind of what was going on with the Orcs after they drank the Fel and turned green in Warcraft. They hated Guldan and could think for themselves but they were conflicted and forced to fight for him or die.
---
There was interest in the PvP until it revealed itself as the clusterfuck of balance that it would be post-HoT. Bunker chrono led to teams quitting two minutes into the game for example. Whatever interest died very quickly, so we might never know how successful it would have been if it was done well. Probably still not very good. 
---
The “6 equipment” includes hundreds of different items with literally millions of potential combinations. Also the fact you didn’t even mention League’s rune system which is far more nuanced than GW2’s trait system shows you know absolutely nothing about the game, so just stop talking. 
---
fastest way to farm trade contracts?
---
\[Revenant\] - Is "Call of the Assassin" under the Invocation tree, a passive?  The way the tool tip reads, it almost sounds like an active ability, but aren't all the skill trees passives?
---
Out of curiosity how long did each of the guilds spend on theorycrafting and practice before recording and submitting? qT's vid mentioned they spent 10ish hours for example and I know KYMS spent 3 hours in practice 1 hour theory crafting about (then about 1 hour for no eat strat)

I don't see a problem with the boots. They fit the druid style very well.

That's why nerfing is usually bad. They should simply buff the lackluster classes.

Arah is the pinnacle of GW2
---
Hey, thanks for critique.  
---
Well, viable doesn't mean interesting to me. I don't feel special using Renegade as one big AoE. I wanted to use the already existing theme and twist it so it would actually depict Kalla with her warband. I'm not a fan of giving Revenant a GS, but if so many people want it and the statue's main weapon is GS I thought that this weapon would fit Kalla perfectly.  
---
Shortbow was added later on the statue, long after PoF.  
---
I liked the potential Renegade had with playing the spirits. For me, it's not engaging playing Kalla, that's why I wanted to make it. Some things look better on paper and I know that people have different expectations. This is just my version of how I'd make Renegade.  
---
As for skills, weapon skills are mostly the same, you just get the extra evade on GS 3.  
---
Utilities are pretty similar to what they were. What's changed is spirit funcionality and additional Elite skill. Renegade's SB is all about opening portals and firing through them, so I wanted to expand it.  
---
Traits are most different from the original, but they still provide you with relatively similar effects to old ones.  
---
Maybe it'd be easier to make a new E-Spec but I wanted to stick to Kalla.
---
This reminds me of Crash Team Racing. Just needs the jaunty music, bazookas, and other racers.
---
It's not meant to be an insult, but if you have the opportunity to adapt your play style to existing mechanics then there's no point of trying to adapt the game mechanics to fit your play style. It's same like saying that raids are very hard when there's tons of people who clear them every week with almost no problems.
---
Interesting. 
---
Thank you everyone. 
---
Enjoy your day/night 
---
Yeah, it would be nice to see them flying around. Or do some action like you can see them giving you barrier, and blast gyro throwing around its bombs. 
---
I agree, it was really fun trying out different approaches with the classes we could use. Appreciate the people organizing this stuff and I hope more guilds start participating next month too.
---
Defenders have already the big advantage of being able to use siege disablers.
---
The high risk of getting on a wall balances how powerful they are.
---
Correct! He lifts every day, with every action he takes. He lifts the stones that create the foundation of dredge progress, he lifts the spirits of his people as they march onward, and he lifts the chains of oppression off their shoulders so they may lift others!
---
It is the tengu, and among the many reasons why it is the tengu is that they are not dredge. 
---
ITT: longbow rangers that can't click their endurance bar fast enough to dodge a temporal curtain (what's that?) and want to be invincible while they pew people from inside their sieged objectives
---
I wasn’t even talking in terms of the balance. I was responding in the spirit of the original post. I wasn’t even suggesting a change. I was simply posing a “what if...” You seemed to think my questions came from ignorance since you accused me of not even playing the game. I’m glad to hear that I was mistaken. 
---
Call of the assassin is part of https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Song_of_the_Mists which is I guess an active trait. Same with renegade's trait, they both happen when you do something.
---
Traits arent just passives, they improve your character whether it's through passive bonuses or enhancing your actions/skills/class mechanics etc.
---
&gt;that installed spyware

If you want to define all anti-cheat code as spyware then it's impossible to deal with cheaters without it.

Chrono. If your fractal level is above 70-75 you should be able to see the lfg and requirements.
---
Well defense is best built in layers. If this fantasy castle's magic barrier is somehow dispelled then the walls still provide some defence against ground troops. Sure the dragon-mounted wizard can fly over it and rain fire down upon the inhabitants, but that's wizard's foot soldiers still need to defeat the wall before they can take the castle.
---
Also why have a castle if you're just going to suspend it in midair and not allow commoners to come and go?
---
how do you even use the z axis for decorations?
---
Because they are immune to blind... fuckers
---
Well, just because dragons and/or magic exist in a fantasy world doesn't mean you should stop defending against actual infantry (which is probably still going to be the bulk of any enemy army you face no matter what world you're in), and "magic barriers" may not be a cost or power-efficient option when you have stone laying around everywhere anyway. And not everyone necessarily has access to the magic nrequired to perpetually levitate an entire castle or town (and then you also have to think about how anyone is ever going to get outside to do everyday stuff), either. In many fantasy worlds, magic is a rare thing that not everyone has access to. Maybe they *can* activate a magical barrier, but only for short spurts when required or something -- in which case having a wall to protect against ground-based attacks 24/7 still makes sense, and they'd be idiots not to build a very simple extra layer of defense.
---
I feel like you're talking about one very specific book or something, because those are some pretty specific scenarios that you've described rather than the pervasive trope that you've implied it to be. The logistics of this stuff is going to depend very heavily on the individual fantasy world that it occurs in, because how magic works, and the availability of it, is going to vary a ton from world to world.
---
Surge?  Sorry, not in front of my game right now.

This is a really weird way to shave and then misspell "Charr"

You could have a Titan V and a i9-9800k and your games would still run like crap, if your configurations are shit.

That's the case. You can insult me as much as you want, it won't change the facts. ;)

You may should come out of your "I do everything perfectly, all others do things wrong" world and join the reality. It would help you solving many problems. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
And the crowd goes mild.
---
it's absolutely not disingenuous and the spyware was not in the best interest of most players, they installed software that monitored what processes were running that the same time as the game, it didn't even bother to check if those programs were actually interfering with the game files or anything, just what was running. Anet flat out denied people the option to appeal and continued to say they were guilty, not actually investigating the results and checking whether they were wrong or if they had been misinterpreted, which they had. spyware should remain a last resort because the sooner it becomes an accepted practise the sooner it becomes easier for companies to install more and more invasive spyware without massive public outcry, privacy is more important than a few cheaters in a videogame (which they don't ban anyway, people report and complain about hackers for months in wvw and they dont get banned for sometimes over a year at a time)
---
My character's look dumb af in the preview wearing that ridiculous helmet.

At this point I would want a wvw event week where they just remove smc and leave an empty field for a week. I wonder where those commanders who endlessly focus on smc will go then

Nope. Not yet. Boon Chrono?

To be fair, the emotional impact is supposed to come from the fact that those "boring monster slaves with no personality" used to be people you *knew*... and you're only a step away from becoming one, too.
---
For me, there's always this underlying sense of horror whenever I remember that, even if I *do* get tired of fighting the same sort of thing, mechanics-wise.
---
Ty.  So what did you mean about using the energy to fill in the rotation?  Think I'm on the verge of an aHA moment.
---
This has always annoyed me in gw2 the people on the walls should have a offensive and defensive advantage, instead it's suicidal, and you can't hit anyone.

I've done The Predator, Aurora, Astralaria and recently finished Ad Infinitum. I'm currently working on Quip, but Mystic Clovers are always the one hurdle that seems to take the longest.
---
Because their weapon set is a history joke
---
....cannot buy gems :/
---
Eh, I'm not bothered by timegates because I'm not always rushing to craft the next legendary/ascended/etc..
---
I craft the daily ascended materials every day regardless of what else I'm doing. So by the time I decide I need them for something, I already have a ton stockpiled. I gather everything I see always, so by the time I need them, I already have a big stack of them. The minute I started even considering making celestial armor, I started taking a couple of minutes out of my day to make a charged quartz every day, just so I'd have a bunch if/when I ever decided to make some (I haven't made the armor yet, but if I ever do, I have enough charged quartz to make a couple of sets now immediately).
---
Eventually I always do get the itch to make another legendary, but I have no desire to constantly make them back-to-back. I focus on one goal at a time -- like right now I'm finishing off my auric and machined weapon collections finally -- and just do all those other things in the background, a little each day, so that the materials build up naturally.
---
The secret is *patience*.
---
Now? I was putting necro wells and marks on walls in 2013.
---
That's stupid

Im an ass charr, thank you

Have you logged in to the website to claim it?

I think maybe i had to do that after i first logged in after i activated 2-step :)
---
[B+] Maybe half-hour getting everyone their roles, 15 minutes finding a tenth... a practice run, and the one we sent in, overall like hour to an hour and half for fun.
---
it took me one year then i bought path of fire for 2 bucks story was good path of fire story is pretty good as well heil joku 
---
That's true I'm just impatient, haha. 
---
The Dredge, because they are the Slavs of the setting
---
You know what I want? The Playable Races Wars. I was so excited with GW2 pre-launch because I was going to be a Charr hunting down and killing humans for taking my homeland. Or maybe I’d be a human trying to survive in the final human stronghold of Divinity’s Reach. 
---
I am so disappointed with the high-school musical levels of “we’re all in this together”. Like fine, there’s an elder dragon- let’s go kill it. At the end of the day, I feel like an elder dragon Isn’t the ultimate bad guy- the ultimate bad guy is the day to day struggle against the other races
---
No it didn't. It had an interest, It wasn't MOBA level or anything but there was a sizeable amount of people watching and a decent amount of teams.
---
It was a little over a year after HoT it got dropped completely because once that expansion dropped, interest dropped massively. It was not fun to watch anymore, They let dumb shit like chrono bunker run riot and did nothing.
---
It was boring to watch and boring to play and with no changes coming, it eventually flopped.
---
&gt; Also, pretty sure the in-game rewards that affect the rest of GW2 would need to be re-evaluated if SAB became a truly permanent fixture through such passes.
---
Since when anet cares about the economey anymore?
---
Booooo
---
Good fight. I wish I was there and my pc could handle the massive amounts of skills and models. This kind of fights is why I live and play for BG/Cookie.

Keep in mind there are always fantastic ways for you to farm your own mats. Or at least, don't sell your mats. Craft with them. Sell the product. You're not obligated to pay the tp brokers anything unless you have to. A lot of profit can be maximized this way here and there, and it really, really piles up in the end. flax is linseed oil, orbs are amalgamated gemstones, logs are planks etc etc :)

I agree, but I have to say I noticed weirdly unrepresentative toxicity aswell - especially from the "early responder" crowd on reddit - These first few comments are ever so often just filled to the brim with negativity, void of objetivity and surprisingly often made by people who claim "dead game", "dying game" and/or that they arent even playing it anymore. 
---
Nope, but I am on windows 10, which has a hidden admin user, which is what I needed. So I did all the shit with that and it actually worked until it didn't. Apparently GW can't have any other programs using the appdata folder? Fuck this shit. 
---
Thanks! Are the ones you can buy from Laurel Merchants usually just vanilla stats?
---
&gt; Apparently GW can't have any other programs using the appdata folder?

Because skritt are small, they are comedic, and unlike a certain aquatic race that always needs help, Skritt are always self sufficient, albiet they are kleptomaniacs, they are great in groups AND they speak fast. More come, yes? 
---
&gt; I will share my own experience that LFG is kind of dead on NA outside of reset time. Most grouping probably happens in guilds. From what I hear, EU LFG is healthy.
---
That's an interesting observation. As an EU player, all the "dungeons are dead", "blah is dead" etc things I see online seem massively exaggerated. There are times when the LFG is *quiet*, and there are definitely zones that aren't as popular, but it's alive and kicking. 
---
They should just take the whole area and make a new zone, with Claw Island inside of it.
---
But I said EU population is good?
---
You're literally agreeing with me.
---
From a comment below, it got me wondering:
---
People who've been on both, what are some differences between EU and NA, other than time zones and likelihood of seeing other languages?
---
Shouts out to Golden \[WE\], our quiet friendly neighborhood hero. Good job!
---
Look at them... 
---
It's chrono BUT chrono is not meta anymore. The LFG groups are slowly shifting from druid+chrono to alacrity/healing renegade and Heal/Quick firebrand. Quickbrand uses nearly the same gear as Dragonhunter. The rarest of those is the alacrity renegade, I'd say. 
---
yeah you stand on walls and don't have line of sight while you get mesmer pulled and nuked by scourges
---
Not *only*, but the game tries to group German speakers, French speakers and Spanish speakers together where possible to make life easier for players. 
---
In reality, it's English + [language], but you definitely end up on maps that are mainly German or whatever sometimes. 
---
Sorry, I meant that in reference to non-administrative and other non-miscellaneous jobs. Just the meat of the employees e.g., level designers, software developers, etc. The ones that will be bringing in the content.
---
1. Equip all your chars with regular tools.
---
2. When you load the char, double-click on each infinite tool in the shared slot to swap the regular tools into the same shared slots.
---
3. When you're done with the char, double-click the regular tools to swap the infinite tools back out.

Imagine the possibilities for Skyrim memes this would unlock
---
how many days you have saved to farm?? 150 days? assuming you get total 50 keys per day (20 from T4+30 discounted)
---
maybe magic and dragons are still super rare in those worlds and we just happen to always get to see them because we're following the most interesting part of that world's narrative. if 99/100 armies that attack are dragon less, walls are still solid ideas
---
&gt;PS: I did Farm all the Encryptions and bought the Keys for the deep discount only (30 Keys per day for 20s ea)! Taking this into account i made 2315,5g profit :)
---
If you farmed all the encryptions then selling them for 23s (they sell for that almost daily.) would bring 19.55s return after TP cut. 
---
1466.25 gold pure profit would be the result of that. 
---
So by opening them your gold went up 2315.5g but you lost 1466.25 gold worth of items so your profit was 849.25 gold.
---
Just fixing the error in your thinking.
---
I believe you can turn off map markers for that or just not look at map (which is a bad suggestion but still). 
---
If you get into raids for the legendary armour you get 2 full sets of ascended armour with stats of your choice for "free" (one set will be converted into the legendary set) 
---
You also dont need to do wvw to get a tag unless you want catmander tag, which is straight up dope
---
&gt; What is *OUR* favorite race in Guild wars and why is it the Dredge?
---
ftfy, comrade
---
Why do I feel so attacked right now D:
---
You have do move the infinite tools in and out of the shared slots to use them though, right?
---
That's bullshit. Balance does matter. Are you saying it doesn't matter if an auto attack hits for 1k or 5k to new players?
---
Judging from an old datamine IIRC the original plan pre-release might have been to have Claw Island as part of a map that never made it into the released game.
---
There was a prototype openworld map, just geometry and few placeholder landmarks from GW1 placed on it, that was in Tyria 3D. Which had a version of Claw Island as part of it.
---
It either got cut because of time constraints, or because it had too much water in it would be my guess.
---
i find the energy cost and cast time for staff 4 is way too horrible for it to be used unless you have a lot of healing power. Staff 3 is a decent block
---
Remove all walls and gates into smc. Raise lord health 5x. Watch one smc fight take up an entire evening.
---
You can ascended gear from several places:
---
- random drop in wvw, and from tequatl/triple trouble
---
- reward from fractal daily chests (rings are much more common)
---
- purchase with armor marks from fractal, wvw, and pvp vendors
---
- purchase from raid vendors (armor marks not needed)
---
- craft it yourself! 
---
Crafting it yourself is always the fastest way if you have gold or materials sitting around. Any ascended armour you purchase will be stat selectable (hot and pof stats). And if you want to get into raids you can get a full set for "free" armour class and stats of your choice, requires you to finish the first envoy armor collection.
---
Seems like the profit calculation is missing the "cost" of using the fractals in this manner versus some other way.  What other ways can fractal relics be turned into gold?  I am not smart enough to figure out a value for them, but someone smarter than me probably can. 
---
Thanks for sharing your results. 
---
or add a wp to it and make it the departure point to cantha or tengu lands
---
Thanks, I see Yassiths but thats ascended nothing for Exotic :(
---
Yea, i meant that you check stats you need then check gw2wiki and how to get armor with those stats :)
---
Bag of Rare Gear and Aetherized weapon skins can drop rarely! I'm guessing they have the same chance. Really unlucky of OP though...
---
It's not supposed to depict siege warfare nothing about gw2 does, it's supposed to be fun and somewhat balanced.

Oh I can use the Rampager's or Rabid stats while I work on the Yassiths, Thanks so much mate!!
---
thanks a lot! 
---
Yassith’s is viper stats, which is the best in slot for condi builds including mirage generally. It’s easier to get ascended vipers right away because the exotic version is a big struggle. Id recommend rabid or dire over rampagers for your situation, its cheap on the tp and will do just fine until you can get ascended viper gear. Some HoT story stuff gives exotic gear with optional viper stats as well. 
---
Yw! It always shows cheaper/easier alternatives while keeping a decent damage 
---
Quaggan will foo up the Dredge any day. 
---
Being downed, being killed, and switching from water to land will all exit you from beast mode.
---
You can remain in Beastmode as long as you want unless you have a specific trait (see Sqies' reply) or you enter water where you have a different pet.
---
Be aware that there's a specific bug with Beastmode however, where by mounting down using the engage skill of almost all mounts on bad terrain you get kicked out of it (or, better, you can't automatically re-enter after mounting down). I reported it a while ago to support and they escalated it to proper team, so maybe there'll be a fix for it in the future.
---
I don't know how long i collected this\^\^
---
Nope
---
Mirage has been historically best suited for Viper's gear (HoT stat).   Rampagers would be sub-optimal since it lacks the expertise stat, but I guess it could be a suitable holdover until you are able to gets your hands on Viper stats. 
---
And unless it’s been changed, Bond of Faith and anything else that dismounts you mid-air
---
I thought someone said yes
---
When it comes to big tournaments (cash prizes, large venues) and such it only pays off if the marketing value brings in more players or if sponsors help offset the cost by buying adverts. I don't recall the initial tourneys pulling in enough people to watch and participation was pretty slim too.
---
I'm not saying there wasn't a decent portion of the community who had interest in spvp, just that it wasn't enough to build on. It flopped in the sense that it was added expense for Anet and didn't see a population or revenue spike for the game. It seemed to only really draw in existing players and have a very limited reach beyond that.
---
I play solo and play in mid/high plat 3, not having a partner doesn't limit you to plat 2... Might be a shock but you just aren't good enough
---
Ah the Swiss and their nifty little pocket knives!
---
Damn I hate you "install Linux :)))" people commenting everywhere that you see someone having problems with other operating systems. Do you realize you're not adding anything to the discussion?
---
I would kill to hear little skill shouts from these guys as PCs :(
---
Change .exe name from Gw2Setup.exe to Gw2.exe - game will start downloading files and run without installation.
---
When you and your pet have an argument, it's always good to have some  space  to cool down 😁
---
What a massive waste of resources though... I mean, it was cool and o appreciate it as a player, but having all of that build up just go to waste feels awful. Even if they just made it so that your home nodes could be accessed there that would make me more likely to go there again as opposed to never.
---
They said they might add more flavor stuff there in the future, but because it is locked behind LS access that means they can't build future dependencies in it in case someone is missing that episode. I feel like there were many other ways to handle that particular problem, but oh well.
---
The thpirit of revolution burnth with a theatheleth flame

Going underwater will force you out of beastmode. Mounting up is also buggy with it, especially in WvW.

Hey! [Here's my scourge.](http://imgur.com/VADR6j0)

Serious answer:
---
Magic find ONLY affects the outcome of monster drops and any item that says 'affected by magic find'.
---
PvP/WvW boxes are the only boxes that are affected by magic find but do not have it in the description. This is because every PvP/WvW reward box with the name of a NPC or monster is like you are killing 5 of those in PvE.

What I'm saying is that ability to rez people is only one of many ways of carrying a group, and won't always be the most effective way. "Amount of carrying" depends on what your group needs.
---
*This*.  Holy cow.  After the personal story character massacre I had no idea how Anet would start building stakes.  Like, everyone I was connected to in the world was dead (even my mentor who still kept popping up for some reason).  How do you create personal stakes in a world that the player has no connection to?
---
Apparently just mine deeper and start killing people from your original game. The fucking shock when I realized Anet was reviving old allies to warp and kill off in order to tell us "Oh!  It's really bad this time!" was the biggest emotional moment I felt in GW2.  They even managed to drag Devona's corpse back as an unwilling murderslave.
---
The good news is that we're practically guaranteed Cantha at this point, if only because Anet needs to refill the beloved character murder tank for the next "big moment".

FREE CITIZENS OF AMNOON, YOUR COUNCIL NEEDS YOU!

How do you get Yassiths
---
Claw Island and Arah would make absolutely great Guild Halls.
---
* We already have the enemy waves for the defenses: Risen.
---
* We already have base maps. 
---
 * Claw  Island just need expanded areas with things like sunken buildings and sand banks that would emerge and get ruined buildings after conquest. 
---
 * Arah would take much more work as it'll look more like the original Arah seen in Jahai Bluffs after restoration. 
---
Uh ...
---
&gt; Balance doesn't matter kitten for new players.
---
vs 
---
&gt; 90% of the complains about balance come from classes that, meta wise, are considered subpar or even bad. Mostly because they don't have the skill nor knowledge to counter those YOLO builds.
---
It doesn't matter but the problem is that there are classes which are crap due to balance? Make up your mind.
---
And yet you were compelled to respond with minimal maturity. I understand that having conversations can be difficult. For some, the temptation to be rude and insulting can be overpowering. Maybe try. 
---
The game mode didn't survive real support builds.
---
Pre-HoT the closest we came were the worker warriors and the boon eles, but those had only modest group support and minimal healing.  Even with those around fights were wars of attrition, working out heals and cooldowns before pressing for a kill.
---
You couldn't play that way with real support tempests and druids running around.  It doesn't matter if you wear an opponent down if they can just heal right back up to full on a short cooldown.  In that world you have to strip and burst to kill anything - and the game needs to be balanced around that 
---
The game isn't nearly as engaging in a burst based world.
---
This isn't just about balance, it's about design.  The capture point, small scale split mode they envision is not compatible with (raid) healers.  They'd have to rip such builds out of the game wholesale to put it back to the old independent, attrition centered play they had at launch.
---
Each episode is a stand alone. You can play season 2 episode 3, don't play fot years and then play season 4 episode 4 without any problem (appart from wtf is going on). If you made future episodes rely on an upgraded instanc it would make this one episode mandatory.
---
Dh is on underpowered side. Thats why his vid is cool to have here :).
---
None of this makes sense.  If the Dragons are giant intelligent creatures with personality and drive, then why aren't they achieving that drive?  It'd have been simple for them to achieve their goals at pretty much any point in their stories.  
---
The Swiss tournament thing was about WvW
---
Yassith is the name of ascended Viper stats. The exotic version is Viper (hella expensive to craft iirc, might as well just go for ascended)
---
Used a combination of every method to get a full set of minstrels gear, which is a HoT Stat combination too. I guess mixing is the fastest way if you don't have at least 8 recipes lying around (you need 1 for each different armor piece /weapon) plus the materials.
---
You will need black diamonds for the insignias /inscriptions by the way
---
Oh man this is a great idea. Its supposedly wrecked from that last attack (ignoring the fact that was 6+ years ago), so rebuilding and upgrading it as the Pact base camp would slot into lore so perfectly. After a  certain amount of upgrades Logan would move in and start offering like... minor boosts like the guild hall guy does. They could sell nodes like home instance in the gem store. Have vendors and crafters set up shop with the regional skins that unlock as you visit those areas, as if you've recruited the craftsmen from those maps. That would be a fun way to simplify the skin collections and make it feel like your commander was having influence in the world as well as a way to show off how much you've done, storywise.
---
Yess. We already have branded, let's have other dragon minions too. Risen/unchained mounts for my necromancer...
---
I wish there was a plant-style glider that wasn't full of flowers D:
---
I don't think the conversation was ever about simulating siege warfare. Can you imagine if we just surrounded the enemy and tried to convince them to surrender? That would be boring as hell. But the presence of siege weapons and the act of sieging a fortification can come with certain expectations. That's what I'm talking about: expectations. I have some friends who started WvW recently (thanks to the Warclaw) and they've had a lot of questions about defending from walls. Most of my responses to them can be summed up as "Hey look, just don't stand in the red circles." I know that's not really a satisfying answer, but I didn't know what else to tell them. So I thought I would extend some of their questions to Reddit... which seems to have inspired a fair amount of hostility for some reason. Thanks for your civil response, btw. No sarcasm.

I hate the "I'm an enemy from a snowy region I must apply chill!" mechanic.
---
Shouldn't that Fractal Encryption Key be 30s each + 1 fractal relic after first 60?
---
never liked pvp in this game because there are no castbars, they want you to read animations but that simply doesnt work in such a spamfest with different animations for every race
---
Yeah, because insulting me will solve your problem, right? 
---
You are ridiculous. It doesn't matter if this game is from 2012, it doesn't matter if you have the highest "top end computer" or whatever &gt;100 fps. **You** have this problem, so **you** should look for a solution instead of accusing random people for "hacking". 
---
"*Hey loock, I'm a hacker!! I make my character model invisible, but still are targetable and everybody still can see my character name!! I'm invincible!!1!!11*"
---
Yeah, I'm absolutely sure that's the case. 
---
You should start thinking realistic, but *hey*! Maybe some more insults will solve your problem, too. ;)
---
When DeadEye was hyped. I was hoping to use it in WvW when i was on the wall. Nope.
---
"I run it through wine on Linux in a virtual machine on Windows on bootcamp on my Hackintosh and it's much better :-)))"
---
Scourge has been nerfed constantly since release.  If you still think it's OP, then fine, but it's not true at all that they nerfed ACs and not Scourge.
---
"I wish this game would stop trying to pay for the free content it has released for two years post expansion."
---
Is this some kind of meme about the post hot aoe creep?
---
But the Sun's Refuge is exactly what it was in GW1. 
---
You had your stuff to upgrade and when you are done, you are done. It's not like there were any updates with EOTN release. And tbh in GW1 too, it was a place you didn't need. 
---
Wot?  The point of wvw is to fight over objectives, not an open field.
---
Silver-Fed Salvage-o-Matic.  60c to use with the same salvage rates as Mystic/Master kits.
---
Where's the charr in a bikini Summer edition?
---
But why? LA already have moorings etc., everything you need for ship traveling. So what would be the reason to start at a defensive bastion?
---
Anvil rock 
---
active defenses &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; passive ones, gotta dodge or block or cc the big hits from enemies rather than trying to facetank everything while spamming 11111
---
its not even summer yet, ill get to it. first i need to find the right look.
---
Umm, you do know about standard enemy model option? I've never had problems reading player attacks and responding properly. Maybe you should try to get better and learn to play other classes. Skill comes with practice. 
---
Erotic role play. Any sex talk/RP on Gw2 is bannable offense 
---
May as well... Logan has nothing else to offer
---
who are you to judge damn law abiding conservative? So let's call it socializing as adult beings within the terms of service for sure...
---
Why join a game for that? Just join a discord server or something. Tf?
---
Never color everything with shadow abyss? Pfff but that's how  my characters manage to look so amazing!
---
Capital d colon.
---
Yes, looking for damage mitigation vice replacing +power stats with others.  I'll look at those skills you mentioned.
---
Would you find the entire Renegade stance to be a bit group-oriented?
---
What is google?
---
Just a troll, or genuinely crazy furry.
---
I don't spam 1.  I'm too low skill level for that.  I spam 2-5 until I deplete endergy, then switch stance and repeat.  Heck, I'm not even using the Renegade utility or f2-4 regularly yet.
---
When I run into a pack of 3-5 mobs in open world, it's hard to know when to dodge.  Just a screen blur with damage numbers.
---
Are you abused as a child why does it concern you this much to question my reason to play a fucking MMO game even thought I didn’t mention looking for a webcam sex?! Tf yer ass dipshit. 
---
Nice too see something nice on here about autism. All I see is prop l e using it as an insult  :(
---
If you've got the funds, it's a good convenience item. 
---
You an also make Mystic Salvage Kits in the mystic forge, which have 250 charges. 
---
&gt;Your build link does not have any sigils, there are quite a few options you can use, depending on what you need the most.
---
Sorry, I forgot.  Between my two swords and staff, I'm using 2x sigil of force, and 2x sigil of impact.
---
If you ever learned how to read you would know I didn't mention webcam sex. It concerns me and pretty much anyone coming to marvel at your thread because we play this game for fun , not for "wink wink meeting people for our kinky side." 
---
This is common on forums everywhere. If you're negative, you're not playing the game. You're sitting at the forums waiting to vent, because the game is not what you want it to be.
---
I'm not often a first responder, because it's hard to play the game and type at the same time. I tend to look at reddit on load screens sometimes, when I'm not in the middle of doing something. But I'm mostly in game.  So sure, your first comment is more likely to be negative. Negative people are more likely to post anyway, because they aren't happy. If you're happy you don't need to bother. 
---
I ran a local computer store that was pretty popular. Virtually all feedback we got was negative, but there wasn't actually much of it. To look at the feedback you'd think it was nothing but complaints, but even people who liked us the most seldom took time to compliment us.
---
Well if they do realise how valuable PvP is they have a very funny way of showing it
---
I didn’t realize for like 60 levels that ele meteor shower needed to channel.  I though it was like lava font and refreshed quickly.  60 levels of not using the highest damage skill on my weapon...
---
What’s that?
---
Which classes do you run?
---
Does it have some sort of auto boot rules?  I tend to join guilds like this then next time i come back I've been kicked for inactivity.
---
except for the achievement it's not worth doing if you ask me.
---
I'm running the DH build from   [https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/power-dragonhunter](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/power-dragonhunter)

Shes running  [https://discretize.eu/builds/necromancer/power-reaper](https://discretize.eu/builds/necromancer/power-reaper) but with soul barbs over vital persistance
---
&gt;Also, damage-wise, Assassin's Presence tends to do better than Notoriety in groups, but for solo play that extra Might is likely better.
---
How is Assassin's Presence proc'd?  It says it has a 9s duration so it must be proc-based, no?
---
How do you make your inventory look like one big bag like that? Is that an addon or something?
---
I am not sure I see a problem the boots are as hideous as the rest of the costume. The only thing that can fix that is just change the whole outfit to a different outfit altogether lol. 
---
Sorry, I meant that the other stances don't have specific evasion skills like Riposting Shadows on Assassin. You always have the dodge ability shared with all classes, regardless of your current stance. Revenant stances generally don't grant you passive benefits.
---
Guild Wars 2 definitely has a learning curve compared to more traditional games, but it's definitely rewarding to practice your "active defenses" (dodges, skills, etc., as opposed to passive stats). Nearly all damage can be avoided through use of active defenses, and you have healing, lifesteal, and boons like Protection to mitigate the rest. 
---
Down votes imminent, but I actual like the helmet. Looks pretty sweet compared to most of the outfit helmets.
---
Dps doesn't carry CMs, get genuinely good at support classes like Chrono or Druid then just lfg for big dick dps
---

While clearly you put a lot of work into this, most Rev mains will have stopped reading after “greatsword,” and written this off as another roleplayer wanting to use his Twilight.  
---
is it worth spending black lion statues on a total make over kit?
---
I love Sylvari necros. All roots and loam and decaying things. Plus the Maleficent Nightmare Court armor is just too perfect.
---
Did the dev's ever explain why they made the new cancer instabs?  Do they just want people spending more time on the gem store and less in fractals or something?
---
Or any other loading screen.

"Have you ever notice how SOFT Rytlock's fur is"  
---
\- The Commander
---
And this is why my character can no longer make eye contact with Rytlock xd
---
it was actually a lot more fun when ppl who played spvp will played that cos they have fun with it , not for farming ascended stuff , collection and stuff...
---
they got reclassified as 'wells' (similar to necro and chrono; but scrappers are exclusively PBAoE); the skill archetype name doesnt make much sense but fits with their new functionality (also allows them to interact with chronomancer runes)
---
heal gyro got better/more reliable
---
cleanse gyro got better/more reliable... but also gained an annoying light field
---
stealth gyro is mostly better, it provides better quality stealth (no visible gyro tagging along behind you), but less duration
---
shredder gyro is still trash (maybe im wrong, i havent seen 'meta' pve dps scrapper parses); the damage is so much lower than listed that i think its either bugged or not scaling with character stats (which would be weird because iirc even though it was a summon it scaled with character stats pre revamp?)... would be more interesting if it did more damage or didnt have a cast time (latter would be more fun)
---
blast gyro...kind of got better? i mean you cant use it at range to knock people about anymore (not that that was anything more than a meme anyway); but you get a fire field and might pulses (because blasting in its own fire field for more might, which then has engi trait synergies)... i still dont like it though; should be an implosion(pull) not an explosion(knockback) to not only fit with scrapper thematically (close ranged brawler) but also synergise better with what its trying to do (hahaha buffed might but now the enemy is out of all your aoes, you're welcome)... the ground effect looks great though
---
bulwark gyro is better solo, worse group (i mean it wont die to rampant aoe damage anymore, but youll die from redirecting all the rampant aoe damage done to nearby randos back to you)
---
I actually have a fully kitted out chrono but I've shelved it.  I feel like it's too late to learn something new.
---
In open world content you can play whatever you want, even a longbow ranger, it's fine. 
---
In "real group content" like raids,fractals,dungeons is no such thing like ranged dps. Whole group has to be stacked in melee range for heals and boon(buff) sharing.
---
I played an engineer a long time ago, and the toolkits lead to an almost overwhelmingly long dps rotation. Anyone know if the addition of Scrapper &amp; Holosmith made the rotation any shorter? Or is it even longer now?
---
Choya master race.
---
Yes, those all exist.  But the OP implies that it's a pervasive problem.  In reality, bots are almost exclusively at the bottom and win traders almost exclusively at the top.
---
I don't think you we're condescending.  I used to play a wow deathknight in a mythic raiding guild that had to ride bench.  I assure you I have no pride left to hurt :)
---
I could always improve but I don't feel like I got worse.  Not in the last 12 weeks atleast.
---
Knowing what's valuable is different from using that value effectively.
---
Holo has a pretty straightforward viable kitless sword rotation that you would probably enjoy, although I think it still does lose out to the rifle+toolkit build.
---
As for scrapper, it doesn't have a good dps rotation in general. It tends to work out better as a support/healer than as a dps build
---
Yup definitely a team activity.  Well solo I guess silverwaste is your best xp grind.  If you dont have map completion then that is an alternative to do two things at once.
---
How many Masteries have you unlocked, and how long have you been level 80? Maybe you're rushing? I feel like I have the opposite problem, Mastery leveling is happening too quickly, but not enough points to keep up..
---
no, it will use the steelstar's ascended weapons skins, which are the crimson antique skins
---
My reading is fine, thank you. That's an accuse, even if it's not full of insults as everything else you write.
---
&gt; Never understood what the fuck happened after the core game.
---
You're not alone here. Focus on releasing new zones and dungeons, and then big expansions. The LW was and still is a mess from a business perspective.
---
Way to twist his words and completely miss the point.
---
&gt; current generation of instabilities  
---
I don't know why but this phrase made me realize something:  Fractals will be getting no patches or fixes or difficulty adjustments going forward because it's in the base F2P game.  These stabs were rushed out the door because the "fractal department" was getting shutdown forever.
---
We'll have to see when it releases but assuming it's the same as last year Dulfy releases a yearly guide to the content and has links to the older years as well. Mostly it's doing the daily and as many of the zones as you can/want. There are some bauble farming routes (mainly digging up the hidden chests that can get a lot per day). The baubles (turned into [bauble baubles](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bauble_Bubble) at 250 per) are only really used for the skins and food. You can also get rare drops from the end chest in the zones like skins that you can sell.
---
&gt; you are getting supply drained
---
And for the fourth time, only if the attackers are idiots. Otherwise, the 60 people outside the objective have multiple supply camps at their disposal while the 5 people inside the objective have a fixed amount of supply available and no additional supply coming in. The result is a foregone conclusion unless the attackers are idiots.
---
Honestly, unless you're trolling or intentionally trying to look clueless, you should just drop this.
---
where is the "build templates why we don't have them" title
---
10/10 would read
---
Other than using Tomes, there's nothing faster than crafting. http://gw2crafts.net/
---
I wouldn't say that for a fact.  We'll have to wait and see.  ArenaNet re-hired Sintor (Cameron).  Ben is gone, but I wouldn't rule out changes to Fractals.  ArenaNet has changed them many, many times in the past several years. 
---
Tbh, I love the soviet joke about them
---
Renegade has All For One which makes summons provide Protection in an AoE around itself.
---
I feel personally attacked by the little blurb underneath. 
---
its the best pirate music.
---
i forget the name of it; but theres a process in concept arting that is just mashing up an almagamation of existing images and overpainting it; this is one of the more egregiously bad examples
---
A little conspiracy page would be awesome.
---
I cant see why you like them
---
Do I need legendary gear or anything alike for that? I only have the basic exotic the booster gave me...  
---
Also is it a team activity?
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Wait crafting XP counts towards mastery XP? I just leveled up armorsmith from 0 to 500 and didn't get a single Mastery XP point. 
---
10/10, we will watch your career with great interest
---
I'd imagine there's other undead dragons like Tequatl that surivived after Zhaitan died. So Claw Island would be a defense based group event, like the original story encounter, but with two other undead dragons attacking at the same time. You'd have the beach head where you need to protect the gun enplacements and such, this would be the most similar to the previous attack on the fort. And then at the docks north you'd have a dragon attacking the docked supply ships from under the water; think of it like the 'Shadow of the Dragon' from the end of season 2 attacking you from underground).
---
Personally for mouse I use the 6-0 keys on there and you can alter other keybinds as needed (Q, E, R are often what people swap out or some two key combos). Ya that boon support build is designed for fractals where you'd provide alacrity to your group (hence why you want diviner gear), it's basically the same build on [dT](http://discretize.eu). I'd suggest looking at the [power herald](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Herald_-_Power_Glint) build if you have that unlocked since it has better survivability and provides it's own boons when solo or in a group. It's not going to be end game viable but the gear is pretty much the same as you're already running. Also on that note don't feel like you have to rush into ascended gear (especially armor) but the trinkets do add a lot to your stats so it's good that you got some. I do have a [guide I'm working on](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide) with a lot of my GW2 resources and some basics, it also links to some other finished guides if you want to check them out as well. Also I'd be happy to help you out in game if you want just let me know.
---
I wasn't sold on the Dredge until I heard the [Weapon Test Engineer in the Molten Alliance Facility](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Molten_Furnace_Fractal#Dialogue) (now the Molten Furnace Fractal).
---
&gt; Weapons Test Engineer: (laugh) New test subjects have arrived. Their timing is exquisite.
---
&gt; Braham: Hey! You'll pay for this!
---
&gt; Weapons Test Engineer: It keens with outrage, the vermin. As if that will save it. As if! (snickers) Begin test now.
---
Funny enough this was just the start. We kept spawning ooze for another 14 hours trying to see how far we could take it. Arc dps was putting off a agent limit error, the lag became so bad the ooze struggled to kill anyone anymore. So we were offering 1k gold for a lupi solo with about 10 seconds input delay his attacks were also affected all in all a weird night sadly I forgot to save the Vod.
---
It's a lvl 76 dungeon, so you don't need any special gear. However, it's faster with 5 players and dmg builds ofcourse. It also should be mentioned that this farm methode is rarely seen nowadays.
---
Some combinaison of Novelties work together some doesn't.  
---
Working Combinaisons examples:  
---
Embiggening Tonic + Enchanted Broom/Friendship Tonic  
---
Selfless Potion + Chair  
---
Endless Desert Tonic + Kite
---
Not Working Combinaison examples:  
---
Miniature Tonic + Musical Harp/Chair
---
There could be a work around depending on where ANet would place the Ooze Tonic.
---
It's an MMO, I suggest you get used to the idea of leaving when something comes up. 
---
The CoF farm isn't something that will shut down if you suddenly have to go, they can just put an lfg for another player. 
---
You being afk for a few minutes will also do nothing if your fellow players aren't complete asses.
---
The CoF farm is flat out the best farm you can do, if you actually want to do it for longer periods, nothing else will come even close and it doesn't even need that much attention. 
---
You get [these](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Encoded_Orders) from bandits around the world, doubleclick and clear the "item cache" without the loading screen (e.g. using a waypoint or going to the character selection screen)
---
Knowing it and not using it starts to veer into the realm of stupidity no?
---
The option in "Combat/Movement: Disable Area of Effect rings" can also hide those and some other bosses attacks (VG blue teleports) completely.  
---
I tried to play with that checked once because I realized the effect clutter greatly reduced due to combo fields not showing, but eventually, I noticed it was also hiding some bosses attacks. It would be great if you guys could change that to hide only other players effects, but always show the PC and enemies effects. 
---
It won't solve the problem with visual clutter, but it would help certainly 
---
I swear if they make a greatsword elementalist I'm going to kill myself.
---
The only alternative I can think of is opening a bunch of [Wintersday Gifts](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Wintersday_Gift) and hope for some rare drops. It might get pretty expensive pretty quickly though.
---
That being said there's apparently also a pretty good build with berserker stats in [Vabbi Builds](http://builds.vabbi.org/). You could compare their playstyles and see if this one fits you better, or use it while you accumulate charged quartz crystals.
---
thanks for the info
