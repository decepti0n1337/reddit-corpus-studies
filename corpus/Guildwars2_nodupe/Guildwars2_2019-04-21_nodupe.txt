Is simply fun.
---
---
---
I see what you mean! But I actually adressed this in paragraph four, maybe just re-read it! :)
---
Hmmm? I am talking about the voice lines spoken. When you arive at the city in POF someone says that you may have killed a dragon or two.
---
Ah, that's a fair price. I'll take two, my good man!
---
Yeah, world comp only consists of Core Tyria now - excluding Southsun Cove, Dry Top, and The Silverwastes.
---
sword doesn't compete with gs, it competes with scepter imo
---

---
  
---
gs will likely be the standard dh dragon for all time since they don't really seem to want to buff longbow
---
Saying you could run anything in the first 2-3 years of the game is very much blatantly untrue. There was a meta for dungeons that evolved over time.
---
Comparing open world to raids, if you meant that, won't work because even still you can run anything in open world. But for dungeons in those days - the closest thing we had to raids - there very much *was* a meta and it was *far* stricter than what we have now.
---
Until I read this post I thought this was real
---
Khm, khm, you have 10 man heal instead with warhorn and heal shout it's a lot of heal and if you need extra heal, there is water overloading and on top of it, you don't need to use all your shouts to keep 25might+fury+prot+swiftness+regen if you have 2 mesmers with SoI in squad
---
I've enjoyed my core ranger for 5 years now.  8 months ago I finally switched from longbow to shortbow and made ascended Viper's set for. I have one of each class with both elites for all, but this has been the most fun. Plus, I have soloed all of the story steps except Hearts and Minds.
---
I don't know what point you're trying to make
---
I agree, The fear of dying just by walking in heart of thorns is gone, magic of being afraid from mobs is gone, lets just griphon up and fly over them. they make everything way too easy.
---
1-3 makes up 63.3% of your power damage on the current meta condi FB build.
---
If you math it out, the difference is just under 0.2% dps loss. Compared to current.
---
conditempest for raids/fractals have to relie in combos to heal for emergencies xD
---
Well, we usually have to fill somewhere between 1 and 3 places with randoms, and then not everyone has optimal classes - the only Mirage players for instance are those that already play Chrono, and they actually want to, so every condition damage boss (Matthias, Soulless Horror, Twins) is a bit of a pain point.
---
Also I agree, it's slow. We were once able to clear 1 to 4 in one session, focussing on actually progressing the next day, but organisation has been a bit difficult and people leave and join. Interestingly, even though we are slow, we manage nearly every boss on the first three tries, very often on the first try. It's just hard for me to properly frame the speed as this is the only group I have despite heavily trying to find another to get more time into Wings 5 and 6, and after years (yes, years) of equally scrounging for the one group I have, who am I to complain.
---
Heart quests were completely fresh take on quests in MMOs that have since become the norm with others.
---
Not having to return to the quest giver to complete or receive the quest, being able to complete them while participating in the more dynamic events and storyline etc.
---
It feels pretty normal now, but it wasn't common approach back in the day.
---
Is the game still only a few very easy dungeons and fractal? Or is there some bigger instanced stuff? Im not talking about world event like the dragons which are a mess.
---
I can see where youre coming from with this! The only thing I'd love you to elaborate on if you dont mind would be the situation when a player who hasn't played HoT but PoF can skip barriers like ley lines, that are locked behind personal progression and global map progression!
---
And of course I wouldnt suggest per-character restrictions. Id rather go for an account wide system like the masteries, since im actually somewhat opposed to the fact that things like waypoints have to be re-unlocked by every new character!
---
Thanks for the extensive answer!
---
Let's be honest, we haven't been doing much saving since the last story step of personal story.
---
But everyone and their awakened grand-mother in Vabbi know that the Great Palawa Joko killed them!
---
Heart of thorns? path of fire? Scarlet?
---
I'm a alluding to another dragons death 😔
---
&gt; Example: Limit mounts to walking speed in a map until a player has completed that map.
---
Working on my 24th map comp, I disagree with this notion because I've already seen it all plenty.  I don't need to revisit these things by being restricted in my movement speed.
---
You know what's amazing about this comment? I made his fur grey too! lmao This whole thing is just tickling me. I love all those little things they put into the games to tie them together. At least lore wise. Coincidence or not, it's what makes this game so immersive. At least to me.
---
Was there another?
---
Yeah it's one of those things where if it's your enemy suffering this, you're happy. But when it's you, it makes you want to gouge out your eyes and pull out your hair.
---
I really like your approach to map exploration!
---
And I'd also love to do some sort of tour as you suggested, but im somewhat short on free time to do that currently, so i'll have to revisit this idea in the future! But i'll definitely notify you when its when the time comes!
---
I'd agree, core power Mesmer can do p much all open world easily. T4's might be a bit sketchy but T1 and T2 no prob. T3's are just elo hell for fractals so I'd just skip them tbh
---
Yes, but that is why I suggested unlocking full speed after completion!
---
Killing elder dragons and gods, releasing unprecedented levels of magic into the world... As we've seen and been told - existence will turn to chaos should another two dragons be eliminated:  Re: LS3E5 - pitting jormag vs primordus.
---
My comment was more about how our 'saving' to this point is simply making things worse, not protecting them.  We are creating our own new threats (pretty much exactly as Joko was saying).
---
Called lag. Are I an aussie?
---
Because Tempest literally do it with 4 clicks? What can be easier that do 4 clicks, 3 of them is just shouts and one is overload?
---
HoT is much more demanding in terms of skill and in terms of group coordination.
---
PoF is easier for solo players and has way less group events in the first place.
---
So if you're a new player, Core -&gt; PoF -&gt; HoT would be a smoother curve. But at the time of HoT launch, people have been so starved for challenging open world, that HoT was a huge jump in it, and even had to be eventually nerfed.
---
I personally find HoT better in all regards. It's a better expansion - it just doesn't have mounts, and uses some of the older tech in the story.
---
HoT has more group content, and less solo content. Big meta events are more on timers. It's busier and more run more often by more people, so that should tell you something.
---
You get gliding instead of mounts and different elite specs, but HoT is my favorite area of the game.
---
The maps are more complex too. Some people find them interesting, some people hate the complexity. I feel HoT is far more replayable than PoF though.
---
you might enjoy power chronomancer.  
---
summoning all those phantasms in contiuum split, reseting the CD of those skills via healsignet and then do the same again outside of continum split and shattering the clones which spawn after a phantasm dies may be your thing and is also highly effective.
---
Not always the oldest combo field -- it's the combo field you've been in the longest.  If you step into two at the same time, then I think it's the oldest (Though I'm not 100% sure in that scenario)
---
https://i.imgur.com/EF1GKHF.jpg
---
It had a mixed reception when it first released, but I think it's a great expansion now!
---
\- While older content than PoF, some of the maps are incredibly beautiful and have aged quite well. 
---
\- HoT is more oriented towards group content than PoF.   All 4 maps have sweeping map-wide metas that largely dictate the pace of the map.  Even some of the hero points are super hard to solo.
---
\- HoT is where ANet went nuts with "vertical" map design.  If you like the cliffdiving feeling of running around Jahai Bluffs &amp; Thunderhead Peaks, you might really like HoT.
---
\- The 9 elite specs don't warp the gameplay of classes quite as much as PoF elite specs did, but most of them are fun never the less.
---
\- HoT is wall to wall packed with adventures (minigames).  Some of them are super easy, and some of them are on my list of achievements I'll probably never get unless ANet makes them easier.
---
\- HoT is required for Living World Season 3, which is the best way to get ascended trinkets, and are some of my favorite maps and story instances in the game!
---
Have you played the most recent living story chapter?
---
I thought that world completion tracker only followed central tyria?
---
*I think* the hearts are there to keep players around long enough to notice all they dynamic events going on and they were intended largely as training wheels which why you don't have them in Orr or HoT but players wanted them back so POF had them again.
---
Why would I swap a Druid out for an even weaker healer that has an even lower overall dps contribution to the squad? Even without GoE and nerfed pet attributes, a Druid bringing Frost/Sun, Spotter, and Iboga is going to be more than 5k overall dps contribution. Additionally, to my knowledge Tempest struggles to perform Druid mechanics such as immobilizing and pushing things. That's not even mentioning that sometimes Tempests get trolled by combo field prioritization when they're trying to stack boons mid-fight.
---
If one of our Druids showed up and was like, "I'm going to play healing might Tempest today" I'd be OK to give it a shot, but I'm not going to go out of my way to convince someone to gear one. Getting someone to gear either version of alacrity Renegade is proving to be challenging enough.
---
I meant relevant in a non subjective way. What exactly would everyone playing and having mounts get out of restricting the for the ephemeral, intangible, not universally liked sense of exploration?, and there is nothing relevant addressing that.
---
&gt;beeing needlessly agressive really isnt appropriate
---
I am actually enjoying the quality shitposting.
---
Heyoooo
---
For me, I'd say it is the Combat. I never was a big fan of GW1, but my dad loved it and he was excited for GW2. During the first Beta Weekend, I ended up trying a Thief and I really liked how the combat felt in GW2. The skills may be more restrictive than GW1, but the system works better for me. Between that and mechanics like dodging, the combat can be really fun. And this is mostly coming from stuff like Open World even.
---
As for content I play the game for, I like exploring the maps, completing the story, and WvW. For a newer player, I'd suggest to just play around the maps and work on your personal story. The maps do have a lot of neat stuff to do and find and there are a lot to explore. But if open world/PvE isn't your thing, then I think you can just jump right into PvP or even WvW if that is more your style. But for non-open world PvE, the first Dungeon isn't that high level (30~ I think), but the endgame stuff like Fractals and Raids are, well, endgame...
---
&gt;  requires sacrificing damage.
---
more than an understatement; literally throwing wet noodles
---
it'd be cool if it had new animations but even if it doesn't? I don't think that should be a point towards saying "Skyscale is disappointing".
---
if it still does its job as a flying mount, animations (as long as they still look good) are gonna be the least of my worries. not to mention, recycling animations is what brings this stuff to us sooner rather than later.
---
I wish they had done away with them. Was really happy when they were gone from HoT, bummed when they came back later.
---
Even if I just tell myself to ignore them and it's not like they take away space from other content, the fact that they are just there and there's this annoying little progress bar based on some boring grindy task in the corner of the screen seems to bother me. Worst is how there's cases where you need to complete them in PoF and LS4 to progress the story.
---
Ill tell you end game advice:  tomes of knowledge are useless, mystic clovers are daily 2 from fractals, ascended is useless, and laurels are actually helpful.
---
i'm still salty they nerfed shadow form
---
Fury on the symbol though?
---
Thief is a guarantee. Especially with the upcoming balance patch thief wont play daredevil anymore in pvp (it was rare already but S/D thief will be the stronger one almost every time now).
---
It is also a great wvw build, just get marauder armor and play S/D in wvw as well.
---
Guardian is also pretty good in pvp as a core class. Cant speak on it for wvw though.
---
Ele/Ranger/Mesmer will always be better with elite specs in both formats if you ask me.
---
Gratz!!! Perfect legendary for a DH, if only Anet would improve lb
---
The concept of relevancy is always bound to a subjective viewpoint, no exceptions. Thats just how the world works.
---
Since you're obviously not trying participate in this discussion in a productive manner, I'll stop conversation with you at this point.
---
Depending on ur region, the expansions could be on sale right now
---
Yeah, just take away valuable cc, boon, and cleanse skills! No one needs them!
---
??????
---
Dragon kill count:
---
- Commander of the Pact: 2
---
- Kralkatorric: 1
---
Story of my life. I kept saying in team chat “You guys have support FB in party, use the FB!”
---
Then I switched to Core Guard and couldn’t be happier, no more dependence on randoms in solo queue.
---
&gt;What is waiting for me between levels 20-80
---
Heartbreak.
---
Apparently I am the only one in all of GW2 that doesn't mind hearts. Half the time I get them most of the way done by doing a nearby event and then just off a couple of rogue bandits to finish it up. 
---
But I will admit that is an impressive achievement. Sometimes I will finish a heart without even realizing I've been making progress on it during some of the bigger events.
---
soulbeast is making wvw not fun
---
I'm still annoyed that anet changed mesmer phantasms to not persist after one (two if traited) attack. It was the only playstyle I liked on mesmer and have not played mesmer since.
---
nice snitching lol
---
I think it was in 2013 that berserker got nerfed. More specifically critical damage got nerfed, hard. I'm still hurting from that. It's even why I quit and only came back to the game recently.
---
Where are those gauntlets from?
---
You can position your pet next to you, or on the target. That's all it really takes. A really min/max druid will f1/f3 to get it to stop/start an auto chain for additional cc on "demand" in addition to the f2 skills. When you want to cleanse, you f3 before the f2. When you have to do split target mechanics you either f1 to get it to stay on one target or f3 to avoid it hitting anything. pretty easy to manage even if you can't tell it the exact spot where to stand.
---
have you not played ranger/druid? why are you advocating for the removal of pets :V
---
I did mention I'm a degenerate furry artist, so  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Go for the clovers - get the legendary materials chest.  One of these days, maybe soon, you'll be looking for a new personal goal to set, and you'll start building a legendary.  When that day comes, if you already have a couple dozen clovers in the bank you'll be soooooo happy.
---
Pretty sure Kralk is also at two.
---
Not really its super vague it could mean anything. We technically have killed more(meta event dragons are dragons)
---
&gt; Why do people play this game?
---
We all have free spaces inbetween meeting the demands of survival and waiting for our inevitable deaths. Some people have decided this is a good way to fill them.
---
its server lag then man
---
&gt; Tomes if you're leveling an alt and want to skip some zones you don't like.
---
Thats just plain bad advice when OP is talking about what to do with a chest of loyalty. If you already have tomes lying around cool w/e but using your chest of loyalty on tomes of knowledge is a monumental misuse of that resource.
---
People will say "ignore HoT and only buy PoF"; ignore those people. HoT is pretty good too and gliding is actually really useful - especially if you want to do advanced flying techniques later on.
---
Any chests I don't know what to pick I just save. If you really need something then you know what to pick. If you don't really need something, why open it? Then later you will just regret not choosing something else.
---
What you quoted is not what I said. I asked if the new advertising was working. And it was quite apparent that their efforts at advertising over the past few years was not working very well if at all.
---
They've had raids since a few months into Heart of Thorns (the first expansion, from 2015). There are currently 6 raid wings with 3-4 bosses per wing, and events/minibosses between most regular bosses. Wing 7 is coming soon(tm), shortly after the upcoming living story episode.
---
The raids are 10 man, and I'd put them as around the same difficulty as normal mode to heroic mode difficulty of WoW raids - depending on the boss, and depending on if you're play the challenge mode or the normal mode. A couple of the harder bosses on CM get up there towards being as difficult as some of the easier Mythic difficulty bosses from WoW, imo.
---
At this point I'm content to wait until Tuesday. I'll do some before and after tests.
---
I have flashbacks every time I see the Teragriffs in SW.  Little punks will knock you down, while giving you the FGS effect for good measure.
---
Yeah, I play heal scourge sometimes and usually my raid group runs with one. They're really powerful, but I meant they're not "meta" in the sense that "meta" groups are all about pumping out as much dps as possible.
---
If you look at stuff like snowcrows, they never run more than one healer (almost always a druid for 10 man might stacking), or sometimes even no healer, as their "meta" raid comps. Scourge is really powerful, especially in pugs or less organized groups, but the "meta" is almost always going to be to take a druid over a scourge, at least in raids.
---
With Anets new foray into advertising, and the MMO genre right now in a big slump where everyone is waiting for a new game to release. Theres bound to be a surge of new and returning players looking to test the waters to try out GW2 in the current year.
---
They could use leylines for optional ways, just like they did it with bouncing mushrooms and updrafts in Jahai Bluffs.
---
But still, I already brought some effort to skill out my mount masteries, also to make them faster. So why should I do even more to unlock full mount speed? I already had the work.
---
&gt;using your chest of loyalty on tomes of knowledge is a monumental misuse of that resource
---
If they're crafting or playing content that needs ascended gear then your charmingly Reddity objection is correct. But not everyone does dungeons or PvP and if this is true for /u/icedteafox then the logins will be their only source of ToKs.
---
I think that my question was pretty clear in reference to new players. Was it not? Honest question.
---
Oh my bad, I thought you were referring to thetitle of the actual google doc, apologies about that. Yeah I definitely see where you're coming from, that was a big mistake on my part. Thanks again for the suggestions.
---
Mention the mace speed but not the 30% buff to its damage skill?  Going from a 3.5 power coefficient to a 4.55 on a 6.5s (traited) cooldown skill is kind of a lot, yes?  Add to it that mace's 3rd chain attack is also getting a 10% buff is really getting me excited to try that out.  More spears of justice if block doesn't get triggered sounds awesome too.
---
I didn't realize druid/chrono brought assassins prescience with them.
---
Isn't that clear? I mean it's not that hard to understand.
---
He brought some arguments why he don't like mounts and would like to hear what others think about it and also want to hear some counter arguments. 
---
&gt;**As said I'd love to hear different opinins and counter arguments!**
---
He literally said exactly that...
---
I'm still salty they downgraded visuals on my glorious fireballs, then added pof specs with giant visual nukes.
---
WOW has different difficult lvls too. Several games have. I haven't played gw2 for a couple months, but I used to do raids weekly. Pretty much the current system of 1 size fits all forces most people to enter a raiding guild to reliably succeed raiding. This alone is enough to prevent a huge part of the playerbase from taking part.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Fractals are a good example of difficulty scales. If one could pug a raid as easily as one can pug a fractal there would be a way larger playerbase on this game mode.
---
The only reason I see people against multiple difficult lvls on raids pointing is "we wan't to be special, and keep the players without time/skill out of our game mode". The write walls of text, but in the end, for me, it looks like this. 
---
Hoping to keep players away from your game mode is the dumbest thing possible. It only hurts your own game mode. Seriously, Anet has a history of focusing more resources on game modes that have larger player bases and thus give more profits.
---
It was, I just wanted to clearify the "previous advertisings didn't work" thing.
---
I mean it's a different if something doesn't work or aims a different target.
---
Isn't the game just minutes away from going into maintenance mode? 
---
Some consistency would be nice, GW2 Reddit Sub.
---
I actually started playing when I heard about the layoffs, I thought I'd check it out before (my uninformed ass thought) it would be sent to the farm where NCsoft lovingly takes care of its other MMOs like CoH and Wildstar.
---
As they say, no such thing as bad press. I bet a fair few decided to try it out because of the hubbub.
---
You pretty much defined a whip
---
Holy shit know. Weakness is an absolutely crippling condition. I’d rathe have poison
---
the one that has you stand on the table?
---
Druid is just a shit elite spec now. They have gutted core ranger skills to nerf it (which harms all ranger specs) and they gutted druid skills to nerf it. Elite specs were *never* horizontal progression, they have always been vertical progression, and it's a big part of the reason why druid was the only competitive healing spec - Ventari rev doesn't dedicate an entire elite spec to become a healer, it doesn't have the added unique mechanic that elite specs bring, same with water ele. Firebrand probably should have been a healing elite spec (or at least the option to build as one) but ArenaNet dropped the ball with PoF elite specs and building role diversity.
---
Now druid is being pulled down to match core healing specs (which don't have a bonus mechanic, although some of that is being changed) which is making druid a really one dimensional elite spec, it's becoming a lot of work to accomplish what other healing specs will do without having to juggle a resource mechanic with a cooldown, and without choosing an elite spec and additional mechanic to do so.
---
Other healing specs need buffs and druid needs a redesign. Keep most of the healing stuff under a single set of trait choices, but build an alternate condi DPS build into druid to make the spec worth the space it takes up with the HoT elite specs.
---
I want to see a trait which changes druid's attunement into a solar attunement, loses all the healing abilities, and changes the staff and glyphs to all play a condi role. Give rangers a condi elite spec build choice through the traits.
---
I really hope that this game is not being put out to pasture anytime soon. I get that it's not perfect to many people, but I am hopeful with the new advertising that there really is a a new and concentrated focus on the game. 
---
I don't know why they would be doing all the new advertising for the game if they were interested in sunsetting it. I feel that it is superior to almost any other mmorpg which is out at this time.
---
B-but you start being commander at 70 lvl (earliest)! You were obviously a tourist before that. Don't deny it!
---
There's always a crowd available for the Toxic Spider Queen and even Dry Top has people asking for help. I realize this is anecdotal evidence but I haven't noticed a downward nor upward trend in population because it's always populated to a point that keeping track is impossible.
---
You are a little late to the party, this was already linked in the thread of the announcement
---
That was me!  :-)
---
How dare you call me a tourist?  I’m the hero of Shaemoor!
---
They are super easy with a griffon. I like to glide everywhere on a map first and then when I get bored go back and do the hearts. Also running around like often unlocks the hidden hearts that are easy to miss, or at least gives you an idea of where it would be
---
It’s funny but I noticed something similar on my pve main today and was going to post it.  I primarily WvW but PvE for $$$ and mats for legendaries, food, etc.  It’s a staff weaver does AB and TD daily and DS once in a while.   I’ve been using the weaver this for months.
---
I pulled up the world map and saw that it had 0% completion.  As soon as it was born I joined a squad and took WP to friend in DS.  I then ran back as far as the bottom left corner of VB so I could do that chain of events there.  I go to Divinity’s Reach all of the time with the portal scroll, but there is no WP there to unlock.  I even portal in and out of the LS maps but haven’t touched core Tyria from a completion perspective.
---
What you did is much harder, mine was just an interesting observation .
---
Yes, you actually just missed a 50% off sale a few weeks ago
---
There are a few registered retailers [here](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/#UnitedStates-physical) that you can take a look at, see if there's any sales on any other websites.
---
I think [Nuuvem](https://www.nuuvem.com/item/guild-wars-2-path-fire) (Brazillian retailer) is having a sale right now
---
“FUCK YOU, I WON’T DO WHAT YOU TELL ME”
---
Get into WvW.
---
I just wanna say that's a lovely lineup you've got in your sig there.  I'm sure it's all references.
---
thief sword/dagger is good in pvp and wvw roaming, if you like to zerg then core ele would be your best bet.
---
Rift on Oculus Dash for a virtual desktop
---
Chrono main here.
---
I honestly don't mind competition for the support role, it's fine. What I do mind, is that I put in several weeks/months to learn my class, while you can describe FB/Rene as literal one-button-classes. They need no investement. I literally created an Alacrene, gave it ascended equipment and just did my weekly fastclear with the guild.
---
Imo more difficult to play classes should have bigger payoffs. I really don't want to see the meta be FB/Rene for support instead of Chrono.
---
I recently leveled the class, it was not a great experience.
---
Maybe to YOU
---
Can you stop acting as a white knight and aknowledge the issue that I am talking about? Roul's claims and the info on the website contradict themselves.
---
There has been an increase in number of new players..I usually go to starter zones like kessex hills etc to give off dyes I get in map chat. Recently have seen many new people.
---
I really like the pof maps, and think they've got a lot of soul as well. I stopped quite a few times to just stare at the landscape, they're beautiful. The vanilla maps often feel a little flat to me, now.
---
To the majority , from what I've seen on the sub and in-game. Lots of classes don't need to stat switch often or at all. The majority opinion , seems to be people do it for the skin rather than the utility. With legendary runes and sigils coming , that may change.
---
I'm still mad about Spectral Walk not being able to negate 100% fall damage. And Spectral Wall having limited targets. And infinite range on Epidemic. And being able to waypoint with Spectral Walk active and recall through the waypoint.  
---
Among other things.
---
Only, again, nobody really needs all that healing. It makes an excellent carry for the low-end groups, but there's no real reason to pick one in a normal clear group. Though at least there's not much downside to having a Tempest secondary healer either, unlike having an ele fill a dps slot.
---
I never said that there wasnt a meta, I was saying that there were playstyles accepted outside that meta and I have to disagree it wasnt stricter, ppl very much looked more at if you know what to do in that dungeon than "oh does he have full zerker with strength runes ?" Im referring to the times befor ascendend armor and trinkets btw
---
Yes, because of the difficultly spike given with the introductory raids and dungeons of Cataclysm. Groups literally went from being able to clear Heroic difficulty Ice Crown Citadel to struggling with Bastion of Twilight on normal due to the changes made to make the game deliberately more difficult.
---
The difficultly spike, that ended up pushing players away, was one of the reasons LFR was introduced in 4.3.
---
Oh I agree with you, and I made a similar comment regarding how you literally just press a button to indefinitely maintain one of the most powerful boins in the game and it wasn't very popular.
---
What's really funny too me, is the reasoning behind removing GoE, a skill that takes up a utility slot, has  limited duration, and a cooldown was because it was deemed too passive. Meanwhile, rev has a unique damage boost that doesn't have a cast time, no cooldown, doesn't take up a utility slot, has unlimited duration, and is automatically applied to your party.
---
What's the point of having engaging gameplay anymore?
---
it changes the way you play the game entirely, will still be the jet compared to the skyscale, nothing to do with fashion wars unless you buy skins for it
---
Just test all since PvP doesn't have PvE level restrictions?
---
Idk I’ve mailed Berserker for 3 years now and I’m drooling from the mouth reading these changes.
---
take the Griffon and go have fun in HoT
---
*Completely* forgot about Glint.
---
I think it was a good change. One of the problems with Elite Specs is that they weren't meant to just be straight upgrades to a profession. So when you have specs that are essentially just Ranger But Better or Mesmer But Better then there's no reason to not always choose that option. Having distinct trade-offs and choices makes for more interesting decisions, solidifies specs to cover certain niches and leaves room for further elite specs to come in down the road.
---
Anet did say there were further spec adjustments coming in to address this issue. Low key waiting to see what they do with Chronomancer. If people are tilted about this happening to Druid then the shit that hits the fan when they touch Chrono is going to be a sight to see.
---
Exalted gloves, black lion chest (right)
---
as good as the scenery looks around the map I would deff give it a try.
---
I was there at the time dude. And on druid your self-sustain doesn't matter. It was a net gain for your overall group healing if you took lingering light.
---
only for rifts?
---
I learned an important new word today.
---
Serious though, congrats!
---
In raids and higher tier fractals, yes that's true. Longbow is too slow and weak to be effective in PvE. You might find it fun to toy with in PvP or WvW, and in open world and story modes you can do just about anything, but just about any other weapon will outperform it.
---
Enjoy the report
---
As far as pve is concerned, guardian LB never really was good. It had niche uses in pvp as a lockdown tool, but that’s about all it’s ever been.
---
I'm not even sure if scepter 3 needed a nerf at all, yeah it was pretty strong IF it hit, but imo the visual is easy to spot to react to it in time. Maybe a small nerf, but 50% FeelsBadMan
---
Playing a 3rd person game in VR is asking to throw up, and this game doesn’t really work first person. Do you really want to deal with dodge rolling every 5 seconds in VR? You’d probably hurt yourself.
---
For PvP [thief](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Thief_-_Marauder_S/D), [guard](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Thief_-_Marauder_S/D) and [ranger](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Thief_-_Marauder_S/D) are all stong. Avoid ele and mes though.
---
I would like to argue that core guardian does really good in spvp, along with a few other classes.
---
Definitely not 20ft.
---
It's like wielding your bed sheets and spanking someone with it.
---
Although coming back form a break I have to say I'm really pissed off at the amount of"go do this goddam heart again for a collection". It's one thing to have them, it another to force you repeat them over and over again and it's about laziest half-assed content possible.
---
That’s later
---
Thank you for your replies. Looking at it Laurels seem to be the best use of it for me.
---
I think I was curious how valuable the legendary bits are, but as it will probably be a long time until I will be crafting any it seems Laurels are the way to go.
---
&gt; I don't really see this changing unless they make more classes that can consistently provide might without relying on external SoI support.
---
Lol ok. I was answering your question. Tempest is a class that provides might without SOI. The fuck do you want then.
---
"If you were a Norn, your wild spirit would be a keg of ale"
---
I just re-downloaded the game I hit it up about a year ago around this time, nothing special brought me back just wanted to see how the game was and other stuff got boring. I might be sticking around a bit this time tho
---
I don't agree. Pets should reflect trait choices. The druid fails what should be a core goal of elite specs - does it enhance the core gameplay of what this profession is all about? The 20% pet DPS nerf in this patch is even further proof that druid was never about the ranger or it's core profession mechanic - the freaking pet.
---
Instead of nerfing pet DPS, they should have built some druid mechanics into the pet and created pets which filled a complementary rule to the druid (healing, support). They should have added a support pet (primarily support/healing skills) and created a trait which enhanced pet support abilities (or even added effects like pet does 20% less damage but pulses an AoE heal on hit). The druid as a support spec should have had parts of its kit, not all of it - not even the primary parts, involve the pet.
---
Druids are also useless in WvW zergs. But for roaming Soulbeast is one of the most hated classes.
---
&gt;Is it true that Longbows aren't good nowadays?
---
No, that's not true. They never were any good.
---
A 20% nerf on pet DPS and an elite spec that is a one trick healer. Are you talking solely about fractals? I think the pet DPS nerf is going to cripple them in PvP.
---
You don't get any rewards until you're at 100% anyway so it doesn't really matter but it's easier to track if every marker is worth the same amount instead of having to learn which marker arbitrarily is worth more.
---
Which other downsides have Anet recently added?
---
My recommendation for what to main is guardian, due to how versatile it can be. It has viable condi dps, power dps, support power off dps, support condi off dps, support heal, tank/heal, and major heal builds that you can toy with. Dragonhunter dps is never unwanted in fractals or raids. Healer/tank firebrands are mandatory for a world vs world squad. Condi firebrand is actually not that bad compared to power dps, and has some of the best condi cleave short of epidemic. Heal firebrand in raids is off meta, but can seriously carry a bad group. 
---
I'd wait a few weeks if you're thinking about maining warrior. The berserker elite spec changes may change a lot of things about how the class plays and what gear it will use.
---
Ranger is also a solid pick, although rangers are not on the wvw zerg meta
---
If you thought the game was about to be done then why did you want to spend time and effort on it?  Just curious.
---
getting the gold isn't that hard, just do your daily fractals and some casual flipping in tp and there's always tons of opportunities with crafting and mystic forge
---
Renegade has an even easier time if they want to give might, a single button push. Same with Alacrity.
---
&gt; You can be sure Druid will still be able to get the job done. Simply because how little challenge fractals actually have to offer.
---
That's not why you bring a druid. You brought a druid to shave off the difficulty - sacrifice an entire fifth DPS in exchange for consistent might stacks, several defensive boons, reliable stability during key fights and decent healing.
---
The groups who aren't the 90th percentile are the ones hurt most by this. They are the ones who more often than not needed druid to be as strong as it could be to cover the weakness of the group's performance. You exchanged the speed of a fifth DPS for the stability of a dedicated healer and support.
---
With the several layers of nerfs, I don't think it's worth playing druid over the other options anymore.
---
People who brought druid to fractals usually weren't looking for a challenge or the highest DPS, no mistakes comp, they were looking to support a team and reliably sustain them through challenging content in an effort to make fractals something other than a daily chore that too often goes wrong. The druid nerfs are hurting those players and a lot of them won't play druid when it doesn't accomplish the job it once did.
---
Not quite the same but, this is sort of like how I did World Completion my 2nd, 3rd and 4th times (have done it 4 times total). I collected every single Waypoint on every map before doing anything else (and of course some of the Points Of Interest that happened to be along the way). Afterwards, I could just Waypoint any where to complete the rest.  
---
Can't say it was faster doing it this way by any means, but I liked being able to just Waypoint to nearby Hearts, Vistas etc. when I was completing the rest.
---
They already did.
---
Factions.
---
Heart of Thorns hands down.
---
It’s part of the Welcome Back to Guild Wars 2 event. That Anet has been doing the last few weeks.
---
The thing with power herald is that you are a power class with basically zero burst which defeats the whole purpose of a power class in both fractals and raids. The reason why power classes are good on x boss is because it has many phases with invulnerability frames inbetween so the way to beat the boss effectively is to unleash your burst, let the boss phase, do cc or whatever and repeat.
---
With that being said, if you enjoy power herald you can absolutely play it but you have to live with the fact that, especially in raids, commanders will sometimes ask you to leave/swap due to your class choice. In low li/training groups it really doesn't matter what you play but as you get more experienced you will learn the limits of your class and understand why it's not picked.
---
Now, there is a boon herald build which deals solid dps (if you can do the rotation you will probably outdps some pugs anyway) which is actually a hybrid dps/boon build. The purpose of this build is to help with boon uptime such as might and fury from your glint fracets, plus you give a flat +20% boon duration to your squad which is absolutely amazing in groups that struggle with boon uptime. This build is not meta but it can act as a bandaid in inexperienced groups.
---
In the longterm you will probably gear multiple classes anyway, particularly as a raider it is hard to survive with only 1 class as being able to play more than one class/role allows you to more easily join groups. Therefore, if you enjoy power herald then go for it, just don't be upset if commanders kick you. If it's a training then they are bad comms that have no clue about the game and if it's an experienced group I can understand them as power herald is simply not on the same level as meta power classes.
---
Regarding support renegade, there are two different builds which do similar jobs but fulfill a different purpose. Full alacrity renegade uses diviner gear and heal renegade uses harrier gear. Both are supposed to provide perma 10man alacrity but diviner renegade has no healing output besides kalla elite (which is actually quite strong healing even without any healing power) and diviner renegade brings solid dps but has little burst, just like herald. Since you are quite new, most if not all fractal groups should be playing with a dedicated healer which makes heal renegade the better option for you. Ideally, you have both builds though. Now, in fractals the firebrigade (firebrand+renegade) duo has already caught up, even in pugs, but in raids it is still not seen much in casual/pug groups. I pug raids a lot and let me tell you, while I do see firebrigade comps they are a rare sighting which to me implies that if you were to pug with alacrigade it would take ages to find a group, at least now. The firebrigade comp is actually very good in raids, especially on some bosses but the pug meta just hasn't caught up yet. We will see what happens in the future.
---
With all that out of the way, it will probably be easier for you if you played a different class, in particular if you join pugs. If you plan to raid with a static/guild you can talk to them but with both power herald and support renegade being so niche in raids it probably takes forever to find a group, but that depends on the commander i guess. If they are very chill they will probably let you in. In fractals, however, support renegade is actually meta but as I said earlier, ideally you want both a heal and a diviner setup which is expensive as you need two full sets with agony infusions.
---
But at the same time you are missing out on the perma gold/karma boost from them (i know its not much, but it accumulates over time)
---
Make them more powerful? Like maybe blasting in fire field gives group +2% damage stacking up to five times, rather than might, which comes from plenty of places now. You're right it's gone by the wayside because it doesn't matter much anymore when we've outgrown them. They need their own unique buffs imo
---
Haven't played in a few years. When was the last time the Resplendent Avialan mount skin (peacock raptor) was in the store? How often does it come around? Want it but not sure how long I'll be waiting for it.
---
PoF is such a singlepayer game. I enjoy HoT a hundret times more.
---
Ah, well then its timed really well
---
Do you have the griffon? If not, why give your opinion about something you don't have? Do you post reviews online for items you haven't bought?
---
again? i claimed that last tuesday
---
Yeah its the same one, but its just that i noticed how its relevant for this specific day
---
There's no telling when it'll be back really, as we have no insight in the store rotation.
---
I enjoyed the PoF story more (unless playing a Sylvari, in which case HoT all the way) but HoT maps were amazing and the metas are still great fun.
---
I think they're pretty even.
---
Actually, yes, I remember old post with similar issue. Person was able to use revenant despite not having HoT.
---
Would be interesting to have another poll adding in "vanilla GW2", Season 1, Season 2, Season 3, Season 4
---
Thanks for the answer, as a fact guardian was on my list but I have removed it from said list due to not filling the class fantasy I'm looking for. But definitely will be lvling a guardian when I'm in the mood for lvling. 
---
As for warrior, I'm currently doing nothing on him besides getting the Griffin mount.
---
It was in the store a few weeks ago during the march sales. Should be back soon, they often put the 2000 gem mount skins in the store a few times a year.
---
Worst part about daily hearts is that they lock the merchant away. Wish they just block ability to purchase daily gated materials instead of the WHOLE merchant.
---
&gt;But that's just the thing: it's a guideline, but it isn't treated as one.

Although Weaver is hands down my favourite elite spec and I half-like Hall of Chains (purely for the Dhuum fights, the events kinda suck) and Mythwright Gambit is my favourite raidwing, HoT did almost everything better. Tempest is still a great elite too, HoT maps are a ton more fun to explore, better metas, much better longevity of the mastery system, LS3 fractals were so much better, more consistent raid releases, Draconis Mons is still the greatest LS map by far IMO, etc.
---
And soon you'll have a dragon mount
---
you can actually wait for wyvern mount for upcomming living world.
---
 If Anet is not charging another 150g to us.
---
This ^
---
HoT, I like the jungle more than the desert, I really liked that the maze like multilevel maps that were hard to navigate until you learned them, I like difficulty spike with general mobs and I liked the story much better. Though I'm a bit bias since I like the Sylvari and had been predicting a wham moment with them &gt;!and the jungle dragon being their creater since release.!&lt; Though even without that I kinda feel story since PoF has gotten a bit convoluted and disjointed.
---
That said, while I like the big Metas HoT was too focused on them and I would not want every new map being like that. Also gating everything with mastery was extremely frustrating.
---
I wish they’d make it so you can see your own star on characters that have world completion.
---
I wanted to build that exact thing, but the site is broken for me. Icons don't appear and things don't load. I even tried three different browsers.

HoT was unfinished mess, pof only got meta's in S4.
---
I got the boosts for free so why not use them. Shouldn't I get to maxlevel asap?
---
When giving a percentage you are providing an exact amount. You can't make hyperboles with exact amounts, that's not how it works
---
Annoyingly all the time-gated materials are needed even for the exotic insignia to stat change stuff. You'll need a total of 300 Branded Mass and 18 Exquisite Serpentine Jewels.
---
Branded Mass = 20 per character if you do all 4 hearts - the hearts get really tedious but are the quickest way imo rather than hunting for nodes. 300 Branded Mass is equivalent to doing all 4 hearts on 2.5 characters for six days. Given about 5-10 minutes per heart that puts it at about 1 to 2 hours per day.
---
[Exquisite Serpentite Jewel](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Exquisite_Serpentite_Jewel) are timegated to 3-6 per day (usually 3) from the Hammer's Hoard - to access that chest you either need to do both metas or buy the key from the TP (about 3g). Each insignia that you need is going to need 3 of those; so six days of doing the puzzle. The puzzles are quick enough to do in less than 5 minutes if you skip the hidden chests.
---
I'd estimate that as about 13 hours total to get the materials. Time gating isn't that bad tbh. Evidently if you've got the raid/fractal currency and you're not using it for infinite potions/fractal god then why not reduce the time wasted doing hearts?
---
It’s not your fault. This game can supply online websites with various information with something called IPA, like skill images, but right now it’s broken.

I’d try again on Monday. First time I see it break though

As the banner says, the official game API is experiencing issues. It'll probably get fixed tomorrow.
---
If you want to make gold: [gw2efficiency](https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/laurels)
---
But it is more than 50% of blob contribute to the fight...
---
What i meant is that you can only have 1 Tempest as healer in 10 man squad.
---
No, because you'll have no idea what to do, which is exactly what's happened. The boosts are really for getting a 2nd character up max level. 
---
&gt;Shouldn't I get to max level asap?
---
Part of the point of levelling up is to drip feed you new mechanics and abilities and get you acclimatised to playing the game.
---
People have been saying this for 7 years or so... and yet here we are.
---
I try to pick a main, class and race wise, but I can never stick with it. Sometimes I feel like playing necro or guard or warrior, it's like none of the classes are the right fit. Personally out of necro and rev, I would pick necro. I've never really liked rev and necro can do a lot of things well now.
---
Literally every 200+ kp fractals moved to quickness fb and rene.
---
Strange, I’m doing it right now and I’m having a blast, though my main is mesmer
---
When you say HoT, do you mean "from the start" of "after HoT zones balance update"?
---
Do you not do meta events on this profile? I feel like there's a couple of world bosses with renown crossover, which makes this so amazing.
---
Collecting them to show off how many you have. Mats if you're poor. They're almost useless these days.
---
Thank you! The Exalted stuff looks so awesome! The gloves and the shoulders piece too
---
I mean, by making them do less and less DPS and not able to fulfill any other role....yes?
---
It's anecdotal on my part but I personally haven't seen that much of an uptick in new players. I judge it by the number of new players I see in VB. Of course it's not a perfect method for measuring but that's what I've seen.
---
Will somebody PLEASE think of the tails!
---
Will it work on eu aswell?
---
Oh god no, please no more SAB
---
will do
---
A lot of "being good as healer" comes from knowing the encounters well. When will be the moment where your group needs heals, cc, maybe rez spirit. So get experience in the encounters you wanna play, try to understand what's happening and predict what's going to happen next.
---
Wth are you on about? The healing output of druid didnt get changed, which means you can still get by with the healing it provides. It also still gives 5 man spotter and 10 man frost spirit while shitting out might and fury, decent cc and vuln through storm + burning through sun. Yes they removed GoE which sucks, but 99% of the pugs had no idea when to use it anyway so who gives a shit. The only thing that actually really gets hit are speedkills but those are less than 1% of the raids anyway
---
Oh sorry didn't know. Thanks i will delete my post. Have a nice day ❤️
---
Dps firebrand is a thing too. Not everyone runs heal firebrand
---
Hail Susan
---
Got shorter by lvl 80.
---
Not all of them, but some yeah.
---
You can also play power chrono which is currently one of the strongest dps ever.
---
in fractal firebrigade, usually it's the renegade that heals. power quickbrand is a *lot* of damage
---
Elite specialisation is expansion exclusive and the name says elite so I think it should be unlocked after getting max level. You are upgrading core class to by getting new traitlines. It isnt new class just upgrade that is why you need to reach 80.
---
Power chrono is really strong right now
---
I love it that even the title is showcasing charr problem that their finger is so huge they pressed 'i' that's no where near 'a' or 'r'.
---
If there's a Gw3 it won't be for a long time. And when it does come out and you have an established character you might unlock some cool stuff in the sequel for it. Just like they did if you played gw1 and then gw2. But if you're having fun then that's answer enoug
---
It's good in wvw because it hits like a truck and the animations usually don't render in time Kappa
---
Well you cant backstab with it now or be really sneaky about it, other than that it breaks no deal. Now literally the only time you miss steal its your own fault because you stole into a dodge.
---
I don't think so. Even those people who knows about it barely use it. They don't run around with these bugs all the time. Even I, who loves animation bugs, tonics and stuff and the combination of both, I do this rather rare. For "normal" people I think it's funny for the first few times and then they forget about it. 
---
Also it's not a game breaking bug or anything that impair tha gamplay in any way. Fixing those kind of bugs hase pretty little priority. I don't think they will fix this bug on purpose. 
---
And even though, there are some more bugs like this to use. ;)
---
I can understand wanting to play things right away, but on the other hand I can understand the gating a little bit. HoT and PoF mobs (especially HoT) hit a hell of a lot harder than vanilla game mobs.  Couple that with players barely familiar with the elementalist basics (builds, skills, and elemental attunements), and you have a recipe for ragequitting disaster. Even as a long-time elementalist-main in dungeons, fractals and early raids, I never quite got the hang of Weaver's glassiness and ended up swapping to other classes when running around solo or doing fractals/raids without a static group. If you don't have the support, playing Weaver is painful.
---
Rampage is incredibly telegraphed and easy to avoid. Sure it can wreck somebody who is distracted or didn't bring stunbreaks, but have you seen what a Reaper can do to the entire team that's not paying attention? Their shroud is not on a ninety second cooldown, either. 
---
If you find Rampage to be such a big problem, the issue is with you.
---
This sub is weird. Do what you want and play how you want. It's a feature of convenience you have every right to exercise what you payed for.
---
I think it would've ruined the game for me if I had had access to the mounts (or the HoT gliding skills, for that matter) when I was still below 80 with my first character. But since it's impossible to access mounts on your first run (unless you use a boost) I don't think it's much of an issue.   
---
I also found it surprisingly easy to not use mounts on new characters when it doesn't fit the character's story. My Holosmith never met the girl with the Springers, I don't even think of using the Springer with that character.
---
Path of Fire didn't make me uninstall the game only to look back into it a year later due to utterly unenjoyable the content was in solo play, so there's that
---
To be honest... this could be 100% canon.
---
The thing is that PoF barely has more content than HoT.
---
I would like to play a Chronomancer for T4 Fractals. Is an ascended set of Diviner's equipment sufficient to play both DD and support or will I require more than one set?
---
It would probably be my favourite thing in any game to do if what we were finding was hidden, like a PoI was found by interacting with a NPC and listening to a story or fact, or interacting with an object, and Vistas didn't appear to interact with until you were within 50 feet of them or something.
---
But the fact that you know it's going to be a vista or PoI before you even get there makes it asinine. Nothing worse than running through checklists in a MMORPG.
---
Thank you, I was already confused about his suggestion, when I was looking over the traits I couldn't find much that would remove boons from a enemy that has the boon instability (25 might/protec bosses are evil), now I at least now he had no clue what he was talking about :P
---
Banish is still plenty for NPNG instability, though.  It's a bit of a minigame, but you want to balance your energy level to be around 30 when the next set of boons is coming up, banish them, then swap to Kalla.  By the time the next boon set comes up you'll have Mallyx ready to strip it again.  No idea why he thinks you needed more stripping than a 0 cooldown 3-rip.
---
Well EVE online is a space ship game and i struggle a bit to compare them both when it comes to roaming. If i stretch it out i can see there are differences for sure but there are also similair situations just that it is in space. Also the area you roam in WvW is a little bit smaller then the area you roam in EVE :P
---
As for you being good or bad on different classes i mean i can't really comment about that. I can only give opinions around the game in avrage not you in personal :)
---
Would you like to buy some apples?
---
That is not really adding a downside to the elite spec, that is buffing the core. They specifically said they didn't want to nerf Rev elites to create an artificial downside to using them, and chose to buff core instead.
---
How does nerfing the pet in Druid entice people into core builds?
---
God forbid you's encouraged to play with other people in a multiplayer game.
---
I could not vote because i really liked them both but in a very different way. I loved the meta events that HoT brought, but it was not fun to roam the map and just enjoy the things to do were i went. 
---
PoF on the other hand i still enjoy roaming it and look up some stuff a long the way and find things i did not see yet but the meta events are next to none or not on a schedual so people never really port in to do them and even if they do come the rewards are not really that grea.
---
It is a pitty that they took the advice from the players about only having meta events map to having none in PoF, if they done both solo and meta event map on schedual like desolation, then it would have hit the nail. 
---
Desolation is full of really awsom events that could have been tied together to the big one. But it never did. So the maps kind of run thin and it is so sad because the maps are so great and awsome made and fun to be on. Just no real reason to come.
---
PoF for aesthetics, but HoT wins for replayability.
---
\\o/ this is why you don't scout with your SO \\o/
---
I'm expecting an elite specialzation to not be forced into a single role for a single part of a single game mode, and being subpar everywhere else.
---
I tried a pacifist toon once. I made her an engineer and equipped the med kit so I might never accidentally hurt anyone. I was trying to do any heart I could without killing, so lots of watering plants and picking flowers. Then one time I was feeling cocky and used a flamethrower to destroy some cannons and a mob popped in my range. I walk distracted and talking to my kid or something and next thing I knew I turned back to see this norn pirate had a sliver of health left. Time slowed as I disengaged combat, but it was too late. The burn tick killed her. My punishment was to take over the life that she had taken. I became a pirate.
---
Good luck in your pacifist journey, and never accidentally equip your flamethrower to do a heart.
---
&gt;Though even without that I kinda feel story since PoF has gotten a bit convoluted and disjointed.
---
I'm curious - why do you think this? Personally I found HoT/LS3 era way more disjointed ever since the team decided to go to Rata Novus where the only thing we learn is that "dragons have a weakness". LS3 especially felt all over the place, starting with us investigating White Mantle activity, then going to the fire islands to stop a volcano, then going to the Shiverpeaks to get a dragon minion sample, then back to White Mantle activity, then the Lazarus reveal, then signing up for a supposedly human-only spy organisation through the most convoluted ritual ever to hunt down the real Lazarus, only to learn at the end that our initial goal is at the other side of the continent. Sprinkle Aurene story instances into there too.
---
PoF and LS4 felt way more focused and sensible to me.
---
No, this is EXACTLY why you scout with your SO
---
"buffed tremendously"
---
B-Form has a casttime now =&gt; Can be interupted
---
The Warrior is completly useless outside of B-Form because no burst = No adrenal health/B-power.
---
Berserker MUST play Rage Skills now.
---
Berserker looses 300 Thoughness.
---
Raid sellers are the fucking worst. People get mad at me when I point out people taking advantage of others in this game but that's exactly what it is. If they could get gold by directing people to delete their characters they would.
---
It's fine if you don't like SAB, but I'm not clear on how re-releasing completed content each year is pulling the devs away from other things.
---
Just stock them hoping for devs to add something usefull.
---
Each month you get like 30g in laurels if you exchange them for material bags, an amount that can be easily farmed in 1-2 hours, so imo no worth spending them atm.
---
New advertising and wow disappointment.
---
Advertising head nothing to do with me checking it out. It was a three day long snow storm. Made me realize I have too many outdoor hobbies and I needed something to do when it was crappy.
---
If you aim for endgame PvE, move your heavy berserker gear to a Dragonhunter or warrior.
---
Revenant is pretty good if played Condi Renegade in some raids. 
---
Or alacrity renegade in some specific teamcomps, especially in fractals now that druid gets another nerf, the Firebrand/Renegade combo will be even more prevalent.
---
As for Herald, you can handhite with him on Deimos and thats about it for PvE. 
---
The Herald's jack-of-all-trades nature is better received in WvW and PvP where your worth isnt measured in golem dps.
---
I used to play like that too. Soloed many champions with a chronomancer build like that.
---
Now the chronomancer who used to play like that uses quantity over quality, spamming tons of phantasms to the point enemies are locked in decision making and can't do much, that along the extra damage and the extra phantams from greatsword makes champions go down even faster.
---
And when I want a more lazy 'let NPCs do the job' I bring my minion mancer. Takes longer to solo champions, but it's much safer and can be easily done with one hand while I'm eating something with the other. Nice for daily runs of open world events.
---
Flair checks out.
---
i am new to this tho sometimes it crash and delete the accounts that i put on why
---
&gt;Edit: Wow, the most upvoted comment is a toxic answer telling me to quit the game right away. That is a friendly community towards new players, I must say.
---
Were not telling you to quit.  Were telling you that the game has great tutorials and a great leveling curve, and you've skipped over neadly all of it.  Now you're asking for information that was covered in these tutorials and the simplest solution is "go back through the tutorials."
---
We want you to play this game and be part of the community.  If you're level 60 and want help with the level 55-80 mechanics, we've got you!  But if you're level 60 and you don't understand the level 5 mechanics, the best "training" and "instruction" you're going to get is already built into the game, so that's where we're going to point you.
---
Oh no! It was an accident, I hope you can forgive yourself for it.
---
I'm playing a thief with no weapons equipped for extra insurance I won't hurt anything.
---
Heart of Thorns brought in raids, guild halls and map-wide meta events which are still going strong today. Path of Fire had easily the better storytelling and brought in the frankly amazing quality mounts, plus I generally prefer the Path of Fire elite specs (especially Holosmith).
---
The issue for Path of Fire is that it lacked the replayability of Heart of Thorns' content, plus with the difficulty of raids being generally harder I think the newer raid wings have lacked the audience of wings one through four. My vote goes to Heart of Thorns, but it's definitely close between the two.
---
&gt;If you find yourself on the Sorrow's Furnace server, don't be afraid to look me up!
---
Servers don't work that way. You can play with anyone on an NA server. Servers are primarily for WvW where your server is your team. Beyond that, you can play with anyone as long as they're in the same region (NA servers vs EU servers).
---
Took me 2 days of grinding non stop with the Guide online to get it, then lost interest in the game a few weeks later. Griffon is dope tho.
---
You should have boosted your googling skills instead.   
---
That said, there is so little difference between level 1 and level 60 that it wouldn't matter.
---
Not sure how new you are but all classes need to focus on damage primarily, cc should be covered by most professions. 
---
The best professions are probably Warrior and Mesmer for raw breakbar damage.
---
Never . . . had I imagined Grawl licking themselves. YOU have opened my mind!!! What else licks what!?
---
&gt; You wont be doing any dmg and you will die a lot, especially because you boosted your character and dont have any experience now.
---
OK, the rest of your post is pretty accurate. But how would doing 60 levels worth of easy and boring content teach them anything at all about survival in raids?
---
Well then. Learn something new everyday. Thanks friendo!
---
Hey i understand you. Sorry to assume.
---
Yeah, the only reasonable assumption we can make from this thread is that you are a kind of player who are banned in google.
---
If this Balance Patch makes power berserker a thing... time will tell.
---
For the fact that Power Berserker can probably not be in B-Form 100% of the time. Aka has a long ass downtime where i cant do shit in PvE.
---
3% more damage increase and 300 power will probably not be enough to compensate.
---
The lack of Fury from GS Burst is a problem in PvP. Loosing out on 20% Crit is a huge deal. especially for a e-spec focused on dmg and dmg alone.
---
If druid would have the same downside:
---
Cele Form can now be intereupted.
---
You only have you pet while in cele form.
---
You cant heal outside Cele Form.
---
You must play glyphes and you HAVE to use them even when you normaly not use them to extend cele form.
---
You get - 300 Power ontop.
---
Rifle deadeye in pve is trash
---
In preparation for build templates, of course.
---
&gt; You are strong when you are experienced as we dont have gear treadmill. Better gear wont hide your luck of skill and experience.
---
Oh the irony. WOW is the prime example of a game with "gear threadmill". With wcl you can get extremely detailed snapshots of peoples' skill level, down to how many times they scratched their asshole while in combat. You cannot hide your skill deficit in WOW much more than you cannot do it in GW2 with the extremely barebones analysis opportunities due to deficits in logging.
---
It might be trash to play but it's okay otherwise I guess.
---
Factions is when I started playing. Good times.
---
Hahaha yeah marketing fail :D 
---
JEesus was such a noob, took him 3 days to wp.
---
&gt; yeah sure, we should carry all new players who are doing 5k dps or are dead all the time on elementalist because they should play how they want.
---
So don't? Who is stopping you from kicking them from your groups?
---
Rifle deadeye has really good damage when kneeling. But that’s basically a self root and will get you killed when fighting anything harder than an open world veteran. 
---
It will tear through open world, but in fractals and raids rifle deadeye is... suboptimal.
---
GW2 is one of their better selling games. I'd be willing to say that it can more than support itself. The lay offs affected MANY companies under NCSoft. Anet just got a few projects shelved.
---
You must be new to the game then.
---
ok then, I know nothing about WoW not gonna lie, you are probably right.  
---
And this not about forcing new players to level 1-60, it was about OP's attitude. Not wanting to learn anything, not even reading quides on the same website that have builds. Just boost to 80, get berserker and I am ready to be "dealing the most possible damage". And we all know how it ends.
---
That is the winning mentality. 2 hours on training golem with the right gear and talent setup will teach them more about proper rotations than 100000 hours doing half-afk meta events or leveling through content that has been repeatedly nerfed since even before release.   
---
You need to train hard *and* smart, not just "hard".
---
Very detailed, thanks!
---
I see, thanks.
---
Short answer, not hard, not that expensive, but somewhat timegated (fractal research pages)
---
While it is nice that we get it for a month I would prefer some monthly activities and sab would fit imo as its not tied to any holiday. 
---
Though wow isn't a shining example of content they do feature a monthly rotating mini holiday esque feature: pvp pet week, dark moon faire week, bonus dungeon week, and bonus battleground week, as well as transmog (fashion wars) week, prolly a couple more but that's what I rmemeber. They even keep these events going during big patches to where you have an almost overwhelming amount you could do. I don't play wow anymore because it's really changed terribly and not kept up the times but still...
---
I think gw2 could easily follow suit either one week or weekend or per month of the following:
---
Bonus spvp, bonus wvw, sab fest, southsunsurvival bonus, world boss bonus, fractal bonus, dungeon bonus, etc. 
---
Especially considering the large gaps between content for gw2 this kind of supplemental content would see lfg and pvp and wvw much more full as people are enlivened to pursue the available content. 
---
Any suggestions for other weeks/weekend ideas would be nice. I did not include any other holidays as I feel they are specific to particular times of year.
---
Np^ if u need anything else just ask
---
Hi all, i want to buy the two expansions. [nuuvem](https://www.nuuvem.com/item/guild-wars-2-path-fire) is some brazilian retailer but it says its only NA. Could i use the code and play it on EU?
---
I am afraid you missed OP's point. This wasnt your normal, I need some advices I want to learn how to play the hard elementalist.   
---
It was just: give me best possible stat combo, I dont want to learn anything. I have the gear I am ready. He didnt even put the effort to read what build website says (becasue stats are there and he missed that)
---
And I am here to say harsh truth so that maybe he wont have to be kicked from the groups. Not only he will feel bad and leave the game faster (and we need new players) but also he will waste people time.
---
Why when I read the comments of people wanting to leave the classes all the same or very similar I get the impression that these same people seem to think that raid is a single player content and not thought for 10 people? I wonder if the 32 specializations (core / hot / pof) were perfectly balanced, what would it be like to be the comander and organize a composition for each boss? This for static group would already work, so pug then?
---
The classes should not be the same, I think each should have a differential for decision making in a specific scenario (this includes the other modes like pvp and wvw) for min / max. We returned to the druid that has been suffering constant nerfs, frankly, it has become practically a raid-oriented specialization (a fraction of the pve community that does not already have many players) and that apparently will not have more use in the game after a while. And all those people who invested time and gold in that class? Screw them? 
---
Changing the balance does not mean that there is not going to have a meta for a supposed diversity that already exists. All classes have roles within the raid scenario (including basically all specializations have a role). Wanting to force a change in composition will alienate those who have dedicated that content that is already aging rather than attract new players, who again, will submit to a meta and a specific way to finalize a boss encounter because that content IS NOT SINGLE PLAYER!
---
I'm sorry, I don't even want all the SAB skins. Sames goes with Festival of the Four Winds. I'm so done with all of them. Esp when they're just gona be repeats with nothing new (if just the same old skins, forget it). Don't need new things to work for, need new things to play in.
---
Every class has has a way to apply CC. 
---
The most enjoyable are probably:
---
* Chronomancer with its wells,
---
* Hammer/Mace Warrior,
---
* Reaper has a lot of soft CC - Chilled and plenty of ways to apply Fear,
---
Is it so much though? According to wiki on avg. they give 380ish karma, times 303 is 115k. Which is like 76 LS3 dailies. There 8 of reliable 1-2 min dailies from the top of my head, so it's less than 10 days of LS3 dailies.
---
Warrior with mace and shield
---
Yeah that first jump to get on top of the wall is a tough one.  I learned how to do it myself this year, but it took 20-30 tries the first time, and probably 5-10 each time once I learned how to do it a bit better.  Definitely not as easy as it looks in these videos.  :)
---
For a couple of months now, I’ve been seeing signs of a huge influx of new players. I’ve seen metas fail because players weren’t familiar with the mechanics or were seemingly too under-geared to survive. I’ve noted greater instances of players waiting full-dead for a rez despite the close proximity of a WP. There’s also been a noticeable uptick in players who are unfamiliar with common terms and abbreviations that we use in the game. So I’ve been doing what I can to help them get their bearings. In any case, I think the influx is WHY Anet decided to launch the ad campaign. They’re trying to capitalize on the existing surge of interest.
---
Spellbreaker is more suited for PvP/WvW with his blocks and boonstrips, in PvE there are mostly Condi Berzerk and direct damage core warrior.
---
Firebrand has lower direct damage DPS than dragon hunter iirc. But you can go for:
---
- DPS boon support
---
- condition DPS boon support
---
- full Heal / hybrid support
---
- in some cases you can even tank raid bosses with toughness mechanic, if you squad lacks an experienced chrono tank
---
So Firebrand is the better choice for PvE and even more versatile than the other possible Guardian spec we have atm.

Thanks for info!

Trading Post

I have googled a lot and what I was speficially looking for was what stats to focus on, which I didn't find ANYTHING on. All I ever read was "berserker", which I asked for what it means here, because I didn't find an answer to that either. I also ended up on many different build sites. All of those were either broken and won't work ([https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Weaver\_-\_Power\_DPS\_Fresh\_Air\_Sword](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Weaver_-_Power_DPS_Fresh_Air_Sword)) or are completely outdated and are from before the expansions.
---
I haven't tried to push any kind of work onto anyone else. I asked specific question which people can give specific answers to.  
---
And no, best build and best gear won't mean highest dps if you can't play at all. But suboptimal gear and suboptimal builds will NEVER lead to highest dps, no matter how good you are.  
---
And leveling your character does absolutely nothing for you, if you're not playing an MMO for the first time.  
---
I played until level 20 before boosting and it was nothing but tedious worthless oneshotting of mobs which didn't even try to retaliate, there was nothing to learn there.  
---
Neither could I learn to play my character because the majority of skills were and are not available yet.  
---
So instead of assuming a whole bunch of shit and trashtalking me, how about you just leave me to try and enjoy the game.
---
I 100% believe this
---
If you specify that you're dps and not support, you're fine, chrono does very good damage. People will definitely see chrono and assume support though, so you just gotta be upfront.
---
Multiple sets is definitely useful though. Being able to play support chrono makes lfg (fractals particularly, idk as much about raid lfg) super easy.
---
Yup, they cool now.
---
I tried this once. Completing Hearts without killing is possible, but damn is it boring...
---
How ?
---
Thanks for the answer (even though I got the berserker question answered three times already :P).  
---
I wouldn't normally boost a character, but since the game shoved a gazillion boosts down my throat after logging, I just couldn't resist.  
---
I don't think it really matters whether I learn stuff at level 1 or level 60, so it won't slow down my learning process. Also I'm a hardcore player, so 95% of tutorials are useless to me to begin with. Most of the stuff like how to progress, what to grind, or what to do has to be read online either way. At least I thought that's what it's like as that's the way things goes in basically every other MMO as well.
---
I'm mostly skipping those. If I feel like I can't get through an area because I die too quick I'll probably farm some. Until then, many deaths await!!!
---
&gt;trading 
---
... Of course. I am braindead, sorry. 
---
I see now, thanks!
---
fair. but seriously tho are you like dying to have it?
---
I would like these characters so much more if they actually behaved like this. It's like a taste of KonoSuba to keep things fun.
---
Your art style is wonderful, too!
---
He might have meant f2 for rev in shiro form. But obviously since you weren't playing that still a dumb comment.
---
The game with the expansions is leagues better than the game without. And unlike most games, the expansions don't replace anything. They add to it.
---
I think based off Metabattle there’s an issue with the API right now.
---
Longbow is literally meta for condi Warrior.
---
As much as I love the mounts and enjoy the story of PoF, I will have to go with HoT. 
---
It was a decent story, with a hard fight at the end. The maps, despite all being jungle, all looked distinct and unique. In PoF only the Desert Highlands and part of the Desolation look really different. Even the Elon Riverlands look a little bland.
---
Love the art style.
---
I miss Majory.
---
You can pretty much start tier 1 fractals assuming you have mostly if not entirely exotic gear. For tier 1 it won't matter too much what you're running, but you will want to start working your way towards an effective set of gear before you get near t3/4, which means berserker if you want to play power chrono, or vipers if you want to play condi mirage (vipers gear is harder to come by though). 
---
If you have access to living story season 3 maps, you can get ascended trinkets really easily through the individual map currencies, and those will let you choose the stats on them (including viper stats).
---
haha am catching up to u
---
thats how pvp works this game,l2p your class require time,if you looking for game where you gona master class in  30 mins look somewhere else. sind have  10k+ hours on thief,but if you gona play it like 70% of thiefs now,first steal on range without invis,follow up by getting hit by every shit and feed in  5 sec after using all dodges,be my guest.
---
The more I try other games the more I realize just how much this game gets right. You get GW2 optimized and that's a fucking **WRAP** son.
---
If I open your link the first thing I read is " The Official API is experiencing issues; skill, trait and item data cannot be loaded at the moment." In short thats why its not working. There is an API problem at the moment and thats why ALL  build sites are not working properly at this moment. Just wait a day or two until its fixed. 
---
A lot of ppl answered already but i will do it again, too. Berserker is the Name of a Stat combination (Power, Crit chance and Crit dmg). Its Meta for almost all Power based Dps builds. Just throw it on everything and you  are kinda fine and Meta. (ofc you still have to learn how to play the class, but thats nothing new) 
---
Also Elementalis ist atm not a caster in the endgame. So if you are looking for a caster DMG build i have to disapoint you. Ele is atm using a Sword and is a melee DD. (I read somewhere that you wanted to play a mage/caster, not sure tho). But on the other hand things like "Caster" do not exist in GW Endgame since its all about stacking in one spot no matter if you use a sword, a bow or a staff.
---
Try port forwarding your port or using a vpn like Pia or nord.
---
I love Arah. It's always fun to see how elitist raider dispair with dungeons. Running their meta dps build without any skill for stun breaking or reflection. Way too inflexible.
---
HoT made me love the game, PoF killed my interest in it.
---
And mounts ruined exploration forever.
---
[swooce](https://youtu.be/lpRPl8TlVBU&amp;t=1m55s)
---
Need a “heart progression” guild buff
---
Launch HoT was worse than launch PoF, but as only 1 ep is left I really doubt anything significant will change with PoF at this point  HoT &gt; PoF .  
---
PoF's story is better imo, but this is an MMO and if we are going to go by story alone there are better options out there.  
---
Ultimately, with all things considered HoT is better. (I didn't expect to say this when PoF launched. Anet had the right idea, but it's like they just dropped support for it and just kept going with the story.)
---
Like... don't you get some hearts for just doing the main story in the area?
---
Your right.
---
Toilet Paper
---
I personally main warrior and use spell breaker in PvE. As the other comment said it shines in WvW and PvP because it’s made more to fight against other player classes than pve mobs. That said it can still fight quite well and fun in PvE, it holds its own
---
There's way more things than what I mentioned. It's just an example to show all professions can do CC.
---
For me it was a wintersday infusion.
---
SAB is a time when a loot grubbing virus comes out of remission and affects the population. Similar to Mad King and Winter's day
---
The more you talk the more you make me think you have little idea about how to play tbh. 
---
That's not the problem tho, the problem is that you speak like you hold the ultimate truth while you're just holding on to a mediocre playstyle that doesn't consist on creating situations for your team but instead on trying to compensate the enemy's rotation without really getting the job done.
---
If you're playing elite content like raids then you won't be using one. If you're running in zergs in wvw or doing anything else in Pve then you can use it. If it's fun for you then go for it. If you're playing PvP then you'll probably want to experiment with builds or follow the meta. In which case It's hard to say but if the meta is your thing then you won't be using it right now but that's subject to change with every balance patch.
---
Is GW2 login server down atm? Not sure if there's an issue on my end or my wifi, but I'm stuck at "downloading 0KB (0KB/s)" when trying to launch the client.
---
Seconded for TSW. Literally my favourite MMO. Broke my heart when they shifted to secret world legends and lack of marketing just made everything stop.
---
If u pve use Magical Enrichment / karma enrichment 
---
Pvp wvw use rewards track enrichments or exp
---
Not at all. Take two builds of pretty equal difficulty, like Weaver and Power Chrono. Now, if my power chrono does baseline 20% less dps than the Weaver with perfect rotations, it'll still deal 20% less if we both play equally suboptimally.
---
What you'll see, though, is that many training and lower-level pug raids are full with the easier-to-play classes like Necro and Tempest.
---
Can't be the Chosen One if fetching 100 horse butts isn't in your resume
---
This is an interesting approach to make memories from a game, good luck with your journey!   
---
Bless the "return from death" option xD
---
You can also use the lvl 80 booster to boost your character to lvl 80 into a map called Silverwastes. This is an active map since it's great for gold farming. 
---
Meaning you can test out all classes there by just making a character, using the boost in your shared inventory slot once to level the character and get some lvl 80 gear and then run around in the map. You'll get some random weapons that are suitable for open world and the gear stats will always help you survive more than do damage. So don't worry too much if you feel like it takes time for you to kill things, you'll simply be tankier than most people tend to gear their characters themselves.
---
You can then decide to actually consume the boost (there'll be a clear warning telling you "Are you sure? You'll get these things:") or you can just keep it for a later character.
---
Boosting a character to lvl 80 and then doing the personal story missions (they'll be very easy for a lvl 80 character) and some open world will give you a decent feel for the game. Just don't expect that you'll find the expansion maps easy. Heart of Thorns especially have some annoying mobs and champions when you're new. But those maps are a lot of fun though!
---
So I could craft Twilight by JUST buying Dusk and not crafting things like the perfected nightsword etc?
---
Yeah video on demand sounds about right according to a quick Google search. That said, why can't it just say "video" lol
---
Thanks, wondering why it doesn't just say "video"
---
Hi there. I’m a returning player with 5k+ achievement points and a pretty good understanding of the game. However, what would be the Fastest/most proficient way to farm Mystic Clovers?
---
I’m trying to finally complete Nevermore and the final mat grind for the Mystic Tribute is happening rn. Would the mystic clovers you get from the Battle track in WvW be fastest? Or is there a sPvP track or just a PvE grinding method? Thanks so much. :)
---
I forgot about spirits! I think the might generation can get covered pretty easily by other classes though
---
Correct. You can skip all that by just buying dusk.
---
So *that's* why my time farming centaurs wasn't paying off! I was collecting hooves, not butts. I'm a fool!
---
i did world comp 7 time I have 2 characters like in screen shot I just cant bear my self to do it. One day maybe ...
---
Well, yeah that's the "classic" way to craft a gen1 legendary, since you had to hope for rng or by it of the TP before they introduced legendary crafting with HoT
---
I, uh. I picked that trait. Specifically for that interaction. It was me. I'm so sorry.
---
oh man, I'm really sincerely sorry. It honestly didn't cross my mind that this is actually very spoilery since it's been out for some time. That was an inconsiderate mindset to have while posting and I really am sorry for ruining that bit in the story for you. I'll make sure to be more vigilant and careful the next time around.
---
With the exception of the China server, there are no regional distinctions for Guild Wars 2.  You can use a US code while you're in the EU.
---
HoT somehow I still haven't seen everything and still love some of metas, plus the differences on maps, high and low, I really like pretty landscapes and views on PoF maps but sometimes it feels so wasted and boring, also when it comes to story I somehow enjoyed PoF a little bit more, but I guess it is hard to compete due to what story tells and difference with release date.
---
My question was how much weaker a random build is compared to a meta build. You didn't really answer that.  
---
I'm asking that, becasue I'd prefer playing a caster over a melee anytime.
---
Thanks for the guide though, I'll look into it when I hit 80.
---
Thank you for understanding 🙂
---
You might as well, you'll get new skins and achievement points.  I think the cost is mostly similar, for the first weapon of each type at least.
---
everyone slips up eventually! (or smooches up in their case)
---
Yes, the idea of crafting the precursor was introduced with Heart of Thorns as a more reliable/accessible way to obtain a precursor. Following the legendary recipes, you simply need the precursor, through whatever method you use to get one.
---
SB was already nerfed, nerfing it any further will make it a trash elite spec. Boonbeast build? Sure, it's viable, but you have to put in 3x more effort to be competitive compared to other classes. Pewpew build? It's a joke without unblockable merging. Wvw is even worse, unless you count LB ganking builds preying on newbie players. Those same players that go on forums and demand nerfs.
---
MMO's. The place where you can find a multiverse within a single universe and where logic is as broken as our mirages.
---
Varied skill levels happen all the time in sports teams or choirs/orchestras, especially when you are doing those things for fun and not as a job. So I'm not sure what you're getting at.
---
While HoT was better, it still had the content drought, and LS3 was weaker in all aspects IMO. The WvW map was a disaster, the pvp map was a disaster, and a lot of elite specs were poorly handeled. Chrono + Druid were ultra meta in pve for 3+ years, scrapper and reaper where in the darkest of darks in pve for 3+ years, legendary weapons from HoT are still being released, without the collections mind you, raid armor took 1 year twice, and ended up having a lot of issues with dye channels, etc etc. 
---
And PoF lacks replayability, dead zones after a month (xpac maps, not LS maps), longer release times, less raids and fractal cms. WvW and sPvP were decoupled from xpac releases so those don't count. 
---
Overall I think both had their strong points. The perfect xpac is a middle ground between the 2.
---
Wow, that's quality armor.
---
Happens to me also because my computer is outdated
---
(come back the game's pretty goooooooooood)  
---
I didn't take it like that don't worry, I just realized the spoiler potential this post has for some people and thought to apologize in case you were one of the good folk that would rather experience the reveal ingame!
---
Farm silver wastes and lake doric leather farms.
---
Just bear in mind the extra time investment, from getting Branded Masses, running the metas to get Exquisite Serpentite Jewels, and doing the tasks for the actual achievement/collection part.
---
Cheaper in gold is always good, though, plus you're going to get 12-14 rares out of each dwarven tombs run for the jewels.
---
I don't see your point. If you think using mounts takes away your enjoyment of map exploration, then don't use mounts. Saying they're "too tempting to use" isn't an argument, it's an entirely subjective opinion.
---
Not saying you're totally wrong about the maps and the exploration, but .. really, all you gotta do is not use the mount and boom, classic exploration experience.
---
2k games son and honestly dont give a fuck,if you want,go play condi thief.who give a fuck at this point? 500 ppl player base? you? arguing for no reason,when you know your arguments are wrong? balance is trash,game modes are trash,maps are trash. if you ever wondering why every pvp topic on reedit is getting downvoted to  -50 look at the mirror.
---
 "Requirements" is an excuse I think the old man was too polite to say that you are too low in height xD
---
It can be played on controller, you just need to map the keys to buttons.
---
I have a severe lag in the Black Lion shop and gem shop myself.  Never found a way to fix it, but heading to Fractals of the Mist does lesson it for me.
---
Maybe my computer is just getting on the old side, but I don't lag anywhere else including WvW so I don't know.
---
Ohh I can’t wait! Just flying on the temporary griffins is spoiling me!
---
Makes me hope the next necro elite spec works like a shadow blade using dark magic to fight in melee &amp; buff allies.
---
Not a build, but general guidelines. You'll want to take the Blood Magic spec line and trait Transfusion. For gear, I think you'll either want Clerics or Magi's. Both are available through karma vendors in certain temples in Orr and, I think, on the trading post.
---
True some is better then none, just wish there was more.
---
So you can effectively get them for free if you farm the gold, and it’s not that much gold to farm.
---
It also doesn't tend to function as well since some things require more control.
---
It's a PC game so yeah technically it does. There are even options you can set which make it easier to play with a controller like Action Cam.
---
Depending on the type of controller you're using, you're going to need some software to remap the inputs. [A quick google search shows someone setting it up for GW2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/708eoz/how_to_play_gw2_with_gamepad_do_you_want_a_guide/dn35vgy/).
---
I hardly manage to do fractals when I play, it's not as casual as I want my evenings to be lately.
---
Lake doric. Farm the centaurs at the bottom in the camp for the loot bags they drop. I do this all the time and get quite a lot of stuff.
---
Oh yeah, gold won’t be a problem. It’s just trying to get those timed events that’s hanging me up. A few of the jump puzzles about made me pull my hair out as well 😂
---
&gt; I’m the commander of the Pact, and far too important for such trivial tasks.
---
He said, standing on a random hilltop, staring into the distance and enjoying the nice view. :P
---
Currently engineer has more CC options then any other class.
---
Granted if your going all out CC your sustained dps will suffer (though not so much your burst.)
---
I really enjoy condi mirage. Invuln frames for days and consistently pumps out crazy torment stacks. I have no experience with power chronomancer, I just know that people complain that their raid groups always want them to play chrono.
---
ah okay
---
No it won't ever get official support. Just find your choice of key mapper like xpadder. There are profiles on here to find you can try out. I still use the mouse for inventory management to get back to the action quicker.
---
Correct.
---
Just came back to the game after a few years I’ve barely done any expansion content I have 2x Level 80 from boosts plus others. I’m a PvP whore and I wanna do more of the content where do I start? 
---
Also I need a mount so where does ya boy get an animal to ride?
---
I’m so glad they added them in. I can get from point A to point B so much faster! And nothing looks cooler than a pack of 25+ raptors roaming the desert.
---
Power herald is fantastic. Taking Draconic Echo also means that at open world events or in instanced content, you're constantly spitting out boons for everyone around you even when you selfishly use your facets.
---
You would also have to balance them around up to +100% duration.
---
If Mordemoth can attack the Mother tree in the Grove, it can attack *anywhere!*
---
One thing that has not been mentioned yet is that power herald is arguably the single strongest character you can bring in disorganized group play.  If you are doing open world bosses, grabbing 5 and doing dungeons, or climbing up to T4 fractals there is no better character to use.  It pumps out a ton of high value boons to the group on top of being a solid body, and that is an extreme amount of value whenever those boons get leveraged.
---
Now as others have said it is not a desired character in organized groups - raids and fractal challenge motes.  There groups will expect compositions that provide the Herald's boons from other sources, so you are just left with a solid but unspectacular body.
---
As others have said, you can just move your Herald gear to a Dragonhunter for the single minded burst damage compositions expect.  You should plan on doing that.  However you will have a much better time on a Herald than a Dragonhunter outside of said organized group content.
---
Nice! I’m on day 2, but it’s getting cut in half because of Easter family stuff 😭 I just want to play!
---
Thanks!
---
Try going into a place without less players; like the Fractal lobby or your Guild Hall. Sometimes it works, but sometimes the store is just sloooow and it's not on your end.
---
Well congratulations, you’ve certainly earned it!
---
I think thiefs are mandatory now. So that sounds more like nowadays :P Specially the revealed part.
---
What me? I'm not OP, I wanted to thank you for doing the good work. I hate these people aswell
---
Why are you so angry and sad
---
No need for action cam. Anet has a built in options for setting the camera to a more action oriented one.
---
Candidates require at least 10 years of experience in fruit retrieval industry, a degree in horticulture, a positive reference from the Shaemoor Fields farmer's association as well qualification for a six-week unpaid trial period.
---
In some cases is actually cheaper.
---
The only difference is not getting the achievements.
---
As a very casual player, PoF 1000%. Better story, better map exploration, more immersive.
---
I understand why more dedicated players prefer the replayability of HoT maps though.
---
The privilege of being so un-oppressed you think a charity's website is oppressing you.
---
At the start of PoF Kasmeer joins us and says they were working on it and they seem ok. Then at the end of PoF Marjory appears.
---
It used to be super slow for me too until I upgraded my processor and added more ram to my computer, now it's mostly fine
---
There is a small chance they will go on sale when the next episode releases (within the next month).  There is also a chance they will go on sale in August for GW2's 7th anniversary.
---
This is clearly a reference to something. May a man of culture enlighten me?
---
I'm in the fractal lobby with minimum specs right now. Way faster but still too slow. Now I can see the last page in the transaction with a red generic "unfortunately an error occourred, please try again later" on it. I suppose that error occours because of the time out... maybe I'll try again this evening =/
---
No.
---
Action cam to the rescue!
---
One of us.
---
You only need the pof. Open your character menu and click on the story tab. Now, I don't know if you need to finish your personal story. If you can't do the next step, then the answer is unfortunately yes. If not, click on path of fire subtab, and then click on play this episode. This will send you on a series of missions that will give you a raptor very quickly.
---
Hammer Mace/Shield Warrior has access to the most spammable hard CC, in terms of just flat out number engies have more.
---
Perhaps shut down anything running in the background of your computer as well?  Shut down your antivirus for a few minutes, Steam, etc...  It's ridiculous how that even has to be suggested though.
---
You can avoid picky groups if you go normal T4s/guild groups. But youre own experience is going to be fairly poor since the serious lack of DPS from pHerald will make things much harder. I cant imagine anyone who really enjoys a set of fractals taking 2+ hours to finish because of slow killing and/or wipes from mechanic overload. And if this is an everyday thing for someone, how long will they really play?
---
You dont need to play meta classes only. (Ive stuck with necro for most of my playtime.) But you kind of need to play within the construct of the game, meaning you cant just do whatever you want and pretend like the game functions differently than it actually does.
---
Thread removed: This sub is not LFG.

Lmao mouse child.
---
Btw this apple thing is my weekly heart :)
---
I think they could he used as a means of rewarding your toon for completing a zone or challenge, if you are the quiet observant pacifist you must learn a lot about animal / enemy behaviour. But the game doesn't reflect that.
---
Yep, there's a optional dialogue about in in the first PoF mission.
---
call me mouse child again and I will use my new nuke 3000 hand cannon on you!
---
I just came back too.  Game was very very populated. Was a great surprise.
---
No, you don't even need alts, just talk to the crafting NPC to switch between professions
---
Most other MMOs I've tried since starting GW2 have been lacking in either controls or combat or fashion or lore.
---
Many are better at some of these things, but none are outstanding enough to provide me with a suitable replacement for GW2.
---
^(Also sunk-cost-fallacy)
---
Met an asura the other day, called me a bookah. I think she was hitting on me.
---
That's not comparable. HoT was a features expansion, PoF was a content expansion. HoT introduced a billion mechanics, PoF introduced mounts.
---
Obligatory: [By Ogden's savings, what hammer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7gxrk7MWJk)
---
If I had not done Central tyria completion 7 times before mounts came out, I would agree with you.
---
But now, getting it done is more important than seeing the sights. I've seen them already.
---
Convenience, mostly.
---
For example, I have all armor professions on one crafting alt
---
SAND and DTOP, Twitter: DryTopSAND
---
Few people play pvp considering we are talking raids.
---
&gt;Net gain for outgoing healing? Cool. It’s still worse than other healers,
---
On paper. But this is, in essence, completely wrong because of how frequent CA access is and how easy it is to use. Druid is already very good at burst healing at the cost of very meh sustained healing. Lingering Light cranks that up a bit to where Rejuvenating Tides alone can heal low health up to full health very quickly. Speaking from experience there, and I already know you're speaking from the paper viewpoint wanting to be outraged instead of you know, actually speaking to us actual druid mains.
---
Thank you so much!
---
A trio? Interesting and cool. But why 3? For the challenge I guess right?
---
Also my policy for consumables is magic find / cheap but I guess you are correct.
---
HoT meta events.
---
PoF everything else.
---
Does this statement: "Sometimes I feel that I am being talked down to because of my computer games addiction" implies that im addicted to videogames? 
---
Same goes with the rest of them, do i need to be addicted to videogames to answer the survey?
---
Lol left the game 2 years ago because of what they did to this class... Come back to see what’s up with this game on reddit, find this thread. 
---
Sure doesn’t look like it’s getting any better.
---
na
---
I just logged in to try and the Buy Gems button seems to take a good while to open up for me, too. You might need to leave the gem store open for a minute or so as it loads everything and then try purchasing? Either way, yeah, it's a real hassle and has definitely stopped me from making some impulse purchases before.
---
Unfortunately, that doesn't work for me (it was one of the first things I tried, actually).
---
It might help someone else, anyway.
---
P.S.: Só pra registro, também sou do [\#abnt2team!](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3hO4OdXrxbc/maxresdefault.jpg) xD
---
Did they were in sale last year for the anniversary ?
---
Thank you :)
---
Having boonstrip is really good in PoF maps. Stripping protection from the tanky ones and swiftness from Mr. Rollerblades really makes a difference.
---
Completed! 
---
Best of luck!
---
Hardest 17% in the game.  
---
Also, didn't even finish any by accident or incidental events? That's dedication
---
When I attempted this collection, the fastest way I found to farm geodes was to map complete the zone on your alts followed by spamming events during sandstorm.  I highly recommend to grab 3 to 5 friends that is needing to work on this collection to help cover events with you.  If you can consistently hit t4 you should have the geodes related costs done rather quickly.
---
Wait, since when can we buy more than ONE additional crafting slot?
---
In LotRO, somewhere in the depths of Moria, after you've defeated countless evils (including several powerful minions of the Dark Lord), a dwarf will have you cleaning up goat dung. There's lending a helping hand, and then there's blatant disrespect.
---
&gt; You'll just never fully experience the maps if you ignore most of their design and basically take the easy way out.
---
I fully agree. 
---
But that's the players choice and mounts don't take away this choice. If a player wants to fully experience a map, he can do, even with mounts (even by using mounts). And if a player don't want this, we won't do this, no matter if he has a mount or not. I mean before we had mounts, we used every kind of mobility skill to move fast. If we wanted to explore the map, we didn't use those.
---
There is a huge area between "everything is the same but in different colors" and "boost the squad damage by 30% but only on druid". We currently have a good set of heal builds with varying strengths and weaknesses and trimming the passive % DPS from druid was very important to achieve that.
---
Unblockables went through most projectile destruction anyways. There are some examples where it didn't but I think those were confirmed to be bugs. I think they just want to remove projectile destruction since it didn't really have a place in the game.
---
But neither hooves nor butts prove it was a centaur you killed.  Gotta collect torsos.
---
Gw2 end game really kick ass...
---
They haven't done anything to make PoF rewarding yet. Still waiting on that update.
---
best 250g i've spent in this game. and it'll be noicee for Tyria exploration. trust me.
---
Well the issue is that without mounts, I wouldn't be playing as much. Without HOT I wouldn't be playing as much. People who have mounts and take them to HoT aren't really answering the question if the mounts are something they use in HOT to make it playable for them. 
---
HoT became better due to POF for a lot of people....mind you I've always liked (and defended) HOT, but mounts have been a fundamental change in the game for me that can't be understated.
---
I hated that heart, I just killed the giant spiders there far more fun.
---
i think it did? or it just attracted a lot of players who were on hiatus. they decided to give it another try.
---
sexy and you know it.
---
Well I actually was playing a diviner renegade with Renagade/Shiro depending on my enemies I switch to either Demon or Dwarf stance
---
Shiro's superspeed feels nice to have while traveling from point A to point B :), We where facing the end boss of the Chaos fractal "Legendary Brazen Gladiator" with the instability "No Pain, No Gain"
---
And having That char with 25 might and protection is not something I would like to face mind you, we did luckily have a heal firebrand "who made the suggestion" and a necro who volunteered to destroy his boons :)
---
Technically PoF does have a meta where you want tons of people (serpent's ire), but there's very little reason to do it, very little reward for the coordination involved, and it's not even close to the same coordination necessary for just a vb, let alone a dragonstand.
---
It's so awful lol.
---
Why do I have a feeling this would be canon.
---
Actually you don't need to do that
---
 [https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/legendaries](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/legendaries)
---
Then he stacked 25 might and hulk smashed that boulder.
---
this made me literally lough out loud
---
thank you for the reply.
---
That's it, I play with Noone in particular. All the people from the beginning left the game and I haven't found a very active guild since I am not very active myself, because I don't have an active guild. :D
---
Also, I really want to raid, but this takes a lot of time I barely have (at CERTAIN times at least)
---
Had this happen to my staff once, WITH the black scythe effect added to the head. Was awesome.
---
 &gt;Warrior himself has redarded access to defensives and does insane damage compared to his sustain.
---
If by defenses you mean kiting, sure. That said, Warrior has access to zero of their defensive tools while Rampaging.
---
&gt;Giving him elite that forces opponent to stay deffensive for the whole time
---
15 seconds, and if you know what you are doing you can stay offensive the whole time. A good Mesmer will just blind every attack and burn down the Rampager.
---
&gt;Just tell me that warrior during rampage cares AT ALL about any power class like Soulbeast trying to do any damage at him during rampage, and I will understand that you have no clue what are you talking about.
---
A good Soulbeast can easily kill a warrior during Rampage. Warriors are uniquely vulnerable to Longbow, for example. 
---
&gt;Attacking reaper at least does something - it reduces his time in shroud as well as forces him to use brain. You can't say the same about warrior.
---
I already explained how easy it is to CC or completely nullify Rampage. Speaking as a higher-tier player, when playing Spellbreaker I have to choose a very specific time to Rampage, or I will absolutely die. It is the most vulnerable I ever am in a teamfight, and any good player can easily exploit that. 
---
&gt;Most classes don't even take skills specific to doing this
---
Uhh Sigil of Nullification is not class specific? Are you trolling?
---
&gt;I am plat as well, that's not "achievement" in this game that is worth mentioning at all, so I don't even understand you mentioning that...
---
I guess some people do just fail upward.
---
Honestly if you have that much problem with Rampage go use it, it will teach you exactly how to counter it and its limitations. It's good, but it's not all that and a bag if chips.
---
Their spat was more about Kasmeer having a crisis of faith that led to her freezing up allowing Marjory to get injured, and running out after the fact rather than rushing to her side. Not that one was devout and the other wasn't, but that Kasmeer became a deer in headlights when Marjory needed her.
---
My problem is I hate spending gold and resources to change my builds after I've finally completed it. Ugh..
---
Of course he is. The Commander *always* fucks it up.
---
Idk, too many random commentary and video cuts. I also don't like the mob spam in Arah.
---
[removed]
---
It worked on me and my friends. Group of about 9 of us. New and loving it.
---
Stupid sexy commander.
---
You do not need to craft Dusk to make Twilight; buying it (which was the original primary method of obtaining Dusk before HoT) works as well.
---
However, it should be noted that you save money from crafting Dusk, as pointed out [in this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bfpu00/can_you_craft_twilight_if_you_just_buy_dusk_and/elfme9r/).
---
Cmon. OP wants you to do that for them and report what you find. Why are you making it so hard?
---
I like PoF more during the first playtrough, but HoT more for replayability. 
---
The HoT patch that saved HoT heavily helped it aswell.
---
There isn't a MMO without it's poo quest.
---
Probably after the update, since the average reader is going to interpret it as "expansion vs expansion as they are now"
---
And some elite specs!
---
you can try just to focus on one of the faster wings  or leave the hard end boss out, w4 b1-3 is fairly easy and quick
---
I bought 2 extra licenses since I have all 8 on one character. Back in the day I thought that it was smart to level an alt to 80 by doing all the crafting professions to 400.
---
I agree with mobility but then I'm a fat necro.
---
Ah I see, well you are right but then telling all that to new comers may be annoying for them and they just leave idk. I felt like just going with the wind. That's why shit hit the fan but lol it was fun.
---
If I were the commander I wouldn’t...  it I already tagged enough mobs for credit, so I can’t comm cause I need to afk.
---
A bit nicer looking than Google Drive imo. Feel free to use these icons for non-commercial purposes. \^\^ Any feedback is appreciated. (Might need to perhaps fix the categories...) Will try to add new works every few days. Suggestions are welcome. :D
---
Have skills? You mean hero points?
---
Congratz , i'm happy that i found you guys , every day a fun ending of my GW2 experience when we kill the wurms.
---
OP look, this sub likes to circlejerk around this imaginary idea that leveling somehow prepares you for endgame which is false as you clearly noticed: 1shotting trash mobs with an incomplete build teaches you NOTHING except super barebone stuff like what dodging is, what some boons do etc.
---
they also hivemind and mass vote up or down but that's in any sub really..don't you dare question the hivemind!
---
the comment you referenced to had a bunch of misleading "facts" in it..elementalist is one of the harder rotations but it's far behind something like core condi engi , it is probably the most fragile though
---
if you want caster and still be competitive in damage i would suggest scepter fresh air tempest, maaaybe staff weaver but that's pretty weak right now..as you've been told you will be expected to be in melee range regardless
---
your question about the difference in damage between meta and random is stupid if you really played other mmos..it depends on what that random build is, if it makes some sense and it's just 2-3 traits/skills away from the meta or a completely smack totally random build with a weird mix of gear and everything
---
to learn how to play whatever build you pick just go to the golem in lion's arch aerodrome and practice the rotation from snowcrows.com
---
after you get that down start playing it to familiarize yourself further and maybe learn some of the defensive abilities as you might need them on a fragile build such as sword weaver..maybe go do some open world or dungeons or whatever, get 1 shot by trash mobs there and slowly adapt
---
fresh air tempest has the posibility of taking some defensive cooldowns such as arcane shield(double even) or offhand focus(dps loss but hey)..you can also take twist of fate on weaver and read up on your sword skills as some attunements have evades too
---
metabattle.com also has some guides including how to get various types of gear but some of their build choices are questionable
---
Leaves no hero’s behind
---
We are speaking about PvE, this discussion started over PvE, so bringing up PvP is pointless. Nobody ever cared about GoE or spirits in PvP or WvW.
---
It ain't what it used to be in the old days.
---
What?
---
If need be, you can get some gold back by raiding your material storage.  Depending on how long you've been playing, you should have a fair amount of gold there in the form of Mystic Coins, Ectoplasm, T6 fine crafting materials, Lodestones and other such things.
---
Compared to HoT the PoF maps just feel so deserted.
---
Yeah, surprised they haven't swapped the order by now, or redone the page. Before Daily Login Rewards, the achievement rewards and account bonuses were all that appeared.
---
Some of the collection items can also be a PITA to get. Dusk requires going through part of the Obsidian Sanctum(WvW) JP.
---
The stats are fine for exotics without runes yet.  As for weapons, to make the decision easy, keep them all :) seriously, I had one mesmer before and it was the most stacked one off all my characters until I created another one just for chrono.
---
Greatsword will be good for open world and in case you feel squishy against big guys and do not want to get close. But always keep sword as well to get used to your rotations. Mesmer sword is used in all high level contents. Depending on the content and situation you can change your gear anytime.
---
What class(es) would you recommend for a new raid player that are welcome in groups and "easy" to play?
---
Keep up the great work!
---
but cheapest to craft isn't necessarily most flat profit.
---
Even though I don't think it's that likely to happen, it would be pretty interesting to see.
---
Do you customs? Would love one of a wolf. Great job and thank you for sharing your art work.
---
Sounds like the current job Market 😂
---
Insert 3 year experience of working 
---
(Fresh Grads)
---
This^
---
Then just normal dailies (2g), maybe tequatl (2g), sometimes some pvp match....and gold pours on you :) 
---
The rest of regular playing gives rather materials, which have better value as materials than converting them into gold via trading post...in long term...:)
---
But usually there is no need to rush.
---
Thank you very much, I'll wait if possible then :)
---
probably one of the underwater ones
---
Not really but overall I find that panel to  be useless 99% of the time so its layout is basically irrelevant. There is no reason to look at anything in there all that often.
---
WHAT IF YOU WANTED GRIPHON MOUNT
---
AND AREANET SAID 250G AND A LONG LIST TREASURE HUNT ACROSS THE DESSERT.
---
Well I play My DH as a trapper rune Guardian with burn build. Its fun against in PVE and WvW
---
Now I understand everything and why so many dislikes on the video...
---
Dead game? Maybe not. But I played this game since guild wars 1 to know people are very toxic... Specially this community... Sadly. This is why we can't have nice things. The community is more focused on destruction specially if it's other game mode.
---
or just switch map and everything is fine.
---
but hey, its the browser things fault
---
Damage reductions stack mutilicatively  and the damage reducion from [Facet of Nature](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Facet_of_Nature) is 10%. So with Rite of the Great Dwarf it mean a total 55% damage reduction when both are active.
---
PoF - mounts and e.specs
---
HoT - maps and replaybility
---
PoF maps really give 0% reason to come back once you've done then once, on your main. I explored all HoT maps on alts when doing meta events, but never bothered entering PoF map, beside Istan for meta farm.
---
\+1 for that OwO :P
---
There is still a maximum of 130g profit to be had, but yeah, I won't go for it now.
---
Jokes on you! I didn't participated in last two SAB's! I just did one before and had enough! After getting blue/green/orange/red GS's I had enough. Might come back if there will be ever purple one (I prefer to keep my sanity than getting yellow one).
---
Ah, sorry about being harsh then.
---
Well I don't see any horses running around, so either I wemt out and killed a bunch of centaurs or I just drove horses further into extinction. Either way, arguably valuable trophies.
---
That's what got me into the game as I was on a GW2 hiatus of about... half a year? I had barely scratched episode 4 and remembered that I had to complete both 4 and 5 so I can enjoy 6 upon release.
---
PoF also unlocks Revenant ;)
---
See if this works: Open gem store. Open your map. Try your transaction.
---
This is the only way I've been able to use the TP for the last few weeks and still remain sane.
---
You mean, that later you can switch back and still have 500/500? No need to lvl it?
---
Must be the weight of his choices huh...
---
We don't need the FB to maintain all other stuff as they maintain Might though. FB with Renegade is typically the Quickness and Fury supplier, but if one pairs FB with a Chrono as they would a regular off healer, FB can bring 25 Might and reasonable heals well enough. Same with Renegade.
---
I've been playing this game since 2013 on several accounts and several computers in varying graphics settings and it has literally never crashed a single time on me
---
Thanks for this! I was thinking about going Guardian, and it sounds like with what you mentioned with boons then that should work well enough. I appreciate all the advice!
---
Yeah, because if you open them on a 80, you'll get a buttload of bloodstone dust. If you need them, I guess it's fine. But there's *a ton* of sources to get bdust from, so you'll be drowning in them in no time.
---
Pretty sure you should wait the balance patch before deciding e.e
---
How do you like them apples?
---
Hey mate not to be rude but we have a designated questions thread pinned at the top \*and\* a discord for these sorts of questions
---
That aside, Spellbreaker is mostly a great class for PvP and WvW because, while still perfectly servicable in PvE, the elite spec is focused on denial of boon-based support, something that isn't really all that necessary in GW2 PvE.
---
Firebrand is useful just about everywhere. The sheer amount of burning a good condition-built firebrand can apply makes it a decent damage dealer in all game modes, and with healing equipment it can be a great healer/supporter too, though it's currently off-meta as other alternatives, such as a supporting renegade, are stronger yet.
---
yeah.
---
It'S probably me, but I have totally forgotten about this Update... &gt;\_&gt;"
---
Isn't dagger/dagger what you run with when levelling up your ele in power equipment?
---
I guess it's directed at those people. Or maybe it's supposed to make the skill weaker for mob tagging
---
Been there, done that
---
I despised Heart of Thorns. The maps are terrible, are a pain to traverse even with the godsend of mounts. The story feels very rushed. And by god, I refuse to do any map wide Meta event more then once, besides Dragons Stand; that one is actually well designed
---
If I didnt already have HoT, I wouldnt buy it
---
Well-played thief will drive their enemies to insanity even without an elite spec
---
Also non-elite burn guardian is still a great build
---
I didn't know that. Nice.
---
I'm 30 days into starting up (I bought when it was new but didn't stick). I like being able to pop in do my thing pop out. 
---
But as I close in on 80 I am starting to strongly suspect if I don't get a guild I am going to be missing out on 80% of the game soon.
---
Just as a heads up, your characters default to level 80 in structured PvP (not World vs. World though), so you don't have to decide on 2 classes to PvP with.
---
Correct, but if a person just wants fast cash and/or is trying to make the most of limited time, it can be more useful for them to just craft whatever's fastest and cheapest. Not everyone is interested in squeezing every last copper out of it, I suppose.
---
it comes down to the people you play with, if your gonna rely on lfg and not have a static for both fractals and raids, it will be hard for you to play as power herald. If you play with friends for both, then it should not be a problem, but in lfg you probably might get kicked for not playing a meta build. If you don't want to level up another class but would rely on lfg to do both fractals and raids, diviner renegade uses sword/sword and staff and is pretty much a power build with perma alacrity for the group which is a meta build for fractals. As far as raid goes its a bit harder to find a group in lfg as diviner renegade but a static group might like it. The only meta builds i know off as far as revenant goes for raids is condi renegade, although heal renegade/herald is a thing and actually is really good for raids, the noob elitists in lfg only want a really underpowered druid healer.

Pof , because Griffon
---
it made me come back to this game and I'm still playing the game cause of griffon! :P
---
I remember your face from my Dream!
---
So you do the research already assuming addiction because "others" think like that.
---
My god bachelor degree is like spitting in the face of science
---
The storytelling was great, definitely! I just wish that it was less buggy :(
---
I don't know, I looked on Wiki table price, then  compare with crafting recipe on gw2efficiency... Looks for nearly 200g
---
It's difficult.
---
Path of Fire had the mounts, which have a huge effect upon the rest of the game. They're awesome. The locations were also great fun to play through.
---
I didn't like Heart of Thorns as much at the time, as I slipped away from the game midway through S1 (only playing the Siege/Reclaim of Lion's Arch) and came back when the expac came out, and I didn't like the story at first as I was struggling to know who people like Taimi and Canach were.
---
However, going *back* to the content, I've played the Verdant Brink meta tons of times, and I liked how those maps worked. The Path of Fire maps aren't as interesting. Plus I disliked some elements of the PoF story, such as how it handled the character of Vlast.
---
I can't really pick one, but gun-to-my-head, I would pick HoT, as it got me back into the game.
---
Never done Wing 5 before...
---
Only wing 1 til 4 and wing 6 
---
Is wing 5 very hard or is it doable?
---
I am not assuming addiction.
---
This is about being labeled an addict by others.
---
Also bachelor degree is the first step... besides no one has to actualy tell you what the questiones actually mean, maybe im checking how would people respond ifi place the questions as assuming people were addicted
---
Never really played herald, he may have been confused with that then, thx for explaining it for me! :P
---
I think you are mixing things.
---
Mirage is a condi  single target duelist, so playing it in fractals is very much shite. It's good for Raids though. Also getting gear with Viper stats when you're starting out is a pain in the butt. 
---
You should be better off running a dps chrono for climbing to T4s and later either get a new diviner set for support chrono, or stat swap your dps gear to diviner.
---
There is some kind of lag situation happening right now, which is unusual.
---
Exactly. Mind, you don't need to build condi Mirage. The build I was describing was power, after all. Unless you're doing endgame content, there's little imperative to build one way or another on a given class.
---
Guild Wars 2 have always been a pay to play game. ALWAYS. It have not subscription fee or any other way of gaining money except from expansions and the gem store. The gem store have nothing even remotely close to p2w.
---
The core game is f2p and ONLY the core game. It is like a extended trial were you get to try everything core game related and you can do so with no time limit what so ever. You have all this time to try out the game and decided if you want to buy the game. To remove the restrictions from your core game and turn it in to a real account you have to buy either one or both of the expansions. Each expac bring different things. If you only buy HoT you will not get mounts or the elitespecs from PoF. Nor will you have access to anything PoF related. And ofc vice versa if you only buy PoF but not HoT you wont be able to glide or have access to anything HoT related. 
---
So no this game is not pay to win. It is a pay to play game in which when you have tried it out long enough you either buy the expac or you do not. If not then you only have access to the core game features. To those PvP and WvW is still a option to make sure that players get to try this as well, even though they are doing the f2p version. 
---
Also if you are going to use money on the game to buy gems i would rather use those money to buy the game. You can grind for gold and exchange to gems. And since there are frequently sales i am certain that you will get more games for your money then most other games out there give you for those money.
---
Yeah but skipping is annoying too. We have these vast spaces with lots of mobs trying to jump on your throat and nothing else. We basically either spend the majority of our time either fighting trash or avoiding trash.
---
Are you retarded or something? I am asking this 100% serious. So you think it's legit easy and 100% repetetive in every scenario to CC warrior during rampage which consists of - swapping weapon to the one with nullification, attacking to proc it, applying CC skill and all that in between stability pulses, not getting hit by warriors facerollish abilities, or him noticing it and dodging the CC skill?
---
&gt; Honestly if you have that much problem with Rampage go use it, it will teach you exactly how to counter it and its limitations. It's good, but it's not all that and a bag if chips.
---
People legit told me the same when I complained about current Scrapper state. I've found little to no flaws in it's ridiculous sustain and it only confirmed that some designs are just for braindead people, and they take advantage of overperforming in some fields while having no tradeoffs for it's broken aspects.
---
I just simply think that you don't understand my point at all - skills that overperform in too many aspects while losing literally nothing are unhealthy to the meta and narrow player's choices of skills too much.
---
Support and power Chrono are pretty similar in terms of gear. Just switch out a few pieces for Diviner's and you're good. So if you're torn between those two, problem solved!
---
Of course you can. It's the way it was done before anet added the collection thing as an alternative for grinding forever for the precursor drop, gambling at the MF or purchasing it on TP.
---
If you have the gold then it's probably better to just purchase it unless you are an AP completionist.
---
Oh yeah ! I know there was very expensive one in the list. But I wanted the 12 tokkens each day so I get the fast as possible my Leg :D I'm attempting to make it under 1K5 hours... Currently 1K3
---
While you're thinking about this, also understand that the team that made this was actively having people siphoned off of it to work on other games. So this (and probably the next release) is work done when the team was at their weakest. Now they have restructured the teams and they (should) be stronger than before.
---
Okay that got a good snort out of me 😂
---
Nice try and good luck 
---
I skipped the apothecary ones as they are really expensive
---
Please do a dreadnought raptor skin icon!
---
You guys make raids look fun 😀
---
&gt;So you think it's legit easy and 100% repetetive in every scenario to CC warrior during rampage which consists of - swapping weapon to the one with nullification, attacking to proc it, applying CC skill
---
So here's the thing, nullification procs before the skill effect. So say if you switch to Ranger Longbow with Nullification and use knockback, it will eat two boons first. It will also prioritize stability. So it's a guaranteed CC. I'm not sure how you made it to Plat without knowing basics like these to be honest.
---
&gt;I just simply think that you don't understand my point at all - skills that overperform in too many aspects while losing literally nothing
---
You were explained what disadvantages this skill has. They are very pronounced. Honestly at this point I just don't think you read anything in the previous posts.
---
that's how it used to be. and for some reason they completely reversed the other. We used to have skins + bonus at the top (btw those bonus being in top-right corner not only looked better but was also consistent with hero panel), so those + achievements were immediately visible. And it was much better.
---
You know what?I'm going to take that challenge. Like, right now. I LOVE exploring and doing non-combat stuff in combate focused games because It proves that lateral thinking and playing your own way is usually more fun than doing the same thing over and over again.
---
After few testing looks like this is because of my zodiac armor and exalted shoulder when using stealth skill.
---
If you somehow liked base gw2, there’s no question you will like the game with xpacs
---
that'd purely depends on the specific numbers (cooldown, what boons on what interval etc.) and it'd require some playtesting before we know how busted it is if at all.
---
Yea it's just super slow. The tips in this thread will help but it's just way slower than it should be. 
---
I think it's a big oversight on their part. You usually want to make spending money as smooth and easy as possible. Especially for a "micro transaction " system.
---
It's not a buff, it's a change.
---
I'm not sure what I'm looking at but I think it's the new Slenderman.

[Legendary Stavemaster Adryn](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_Stavemaster_Adryn) (dragon's Stand) does an attack(black hole) that does a bunch of 1 dmg, like hundreds of them. Glyph of Unity responds on each damage packet you take and attacks back, like retaliation, but way stronger.
---
Will do, actually thought of that right after posting that comment.
---
&gt; Either way, I've ~~proven my insatiable bloodlust.~~ cornered the market on glue production.
---
FTFY
---
&gt; WvW and sPvP were decoupled from xpac releases so those don't count
---
I agree with your whole comment and I wanted to add to this part that this in turn resulted in a complete drought (again) of PvP/WvW content so to me it does count but in the context that it was basically left to rot until sPvP had mAT and WvW ... yeah, nothing is coming to mind.
---
&gt; for hours or days
---
This only happens if you don't understand how to gain EXP, which was easy then and easy now.
---
&gt; single player experience expansions
---
Can I ask why? Since this game is a MMO, why is this what you are looking for from GW2? Wouldn't you be more satisfied in a true singleplayer game as they would execute this better? I am curious and not intending to cast judgement here!
---
I have a simple question: 
---
I want to play MMORPGS again for a long time, but I never started one because I thought it will be a waste of time anyways and I dont have enough time. 
---
I have like 8 hours a week time to play and I want to know if that is enough to achive something in this game? 
---
Also I have the feeling if I only have this less time to play I will always stay behind because if I reach endgame there will be either a new patch with new content or the game will be closed (because I need so long to achive something and level up). 
---
Thats why I never started any mmorpgs again. Because Im afraid of constantly beeing behind everyone or when I finally reach endgame the game will be closed because it took so much days for me.
---
So should I start or not with only 8 hours per week? Or better search for something else?
---
Starting in your inventory you have 2 account slots one with 2 level 80 boosters and one empty. Save the level 80 boosters for new characters, put whatever you want in the free slot it will show up on all characters.

Row 1: Salvage kit to use on rares, not sure what food that is (looks like a flipped [sesame roast](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Filet_of_Sesame_Roasted_Meat)) probably sell, [cake to sell](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chocolate_Raspberry_Cake), sickle to use (at 80 you just want orichalcum tools (don't bother with lower ones), basic salvage kit to use on blues/greens, pie to sell (can use for magic find if you want really cheap), [stuffing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Wad_of_Enchanted_Stuffing) to sell (historical item that doesn't drop anymore), wintersday transformation potions to use for [masterful toast collection](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Masterful_Toast) or to sell, magicfind/item booster to save in bank.

Adding more, will edit with updates.

I'm rich, you know.
---
That is a ton of icons. Wow. And they're all really good, too.
---
This. Everything you said is true.
---
I had a friend who bought HoT much later after it came out and as I was guiding him through the jungle I would  instinctively take every little mastery based shortcut, then would be like - oh, that's right, you can't go this way yet; over and over. Needless to say, he didn't make it past the first few story missions.
---
Yes, it was extremely grindy, it took me a long ass time to Max my mastery. Yeah, the mobs were overly difficult and a lot of HPs for the normal player were not possible to do solo. On top of this, I found the story extremely slow and boring.
---
PoF was the opposite - the mobs weren't overly difficult, you could do most HPs solo, the masteries weren't grindy and the story was actually fast paced and fun.
---
The only thing HoT has going for it is the replayability, I still do HoT metas very frequently and basically never touch the crystal desert after finishing it.
---
GW2 has horizontal progression meaning that ascended items have been and will continue to be the highest rarity of items (legendary items share this level and have the same stats). Also of note is the fact that between exotics and ascended there is only a 12-13% DPS difference. The game is great to pick up and come back to, you won't be missing out or being left behind. There are a lot of daily limited things in GW2 so if you spread out your time you can get a lot done with only 30min - 1hr, if you play just on one day that's fine too as there is a ton to do especially as you get farther in the game. I'd say go for it, base game is free to play and if you enjoy it the [expansions are pretty cheap](https://dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911).
---
That 5 skill never felt powerful as a lockdown. It has such an obvious and long animation that it barely ever hits. It has the power to bait dodges out from several players at once with its animation, cancel and then reuse it, but I never saw that used much unlike revs glint elite.
---
The Mad Realm Mounts Pack is Hallowe'en-themed, so it will appear every Hallowe'en *at minimum*.
---
GW2 is one of the most casual friendly MMO games to currently be on the market. It allows for great flexibility to play as little or as much as you want and still be able to accomplish goals. Unlike WoW or FF14, GW2 does not offer the traditional gear treadmill with increasing item levels. GW2 focuses on horizontal personal character progression through legendaries, achievements and masteries, mounts etc.
---
 A player from launch in 2012 exotic gear is the same power level as a player in 2019 in exotic gear, they are still relevant. You set your own long term and short term goals, you find what YOU want to do a player, A vast plethora of things to do and you can do it all at your own pace.
---
New patches and Expacs introduce new mechanics, maps, mounts and ways to play but they do not invalidate your equipment. 
---
If you plan on playing ~1 hour a day, you'll have lots of time to enjoy the game, the leveling process and play the various modes of activities in the game and I sincerly hope you give the game your best effort if you plan on joining us, the GW2 community is a immensly friendly community.
---
I enjoy it for a little bit of everything. I bought the game at launch then put it down for five years or so, and when I picked it up again (was bored, remembered I had it, figured I'd give it another shot) I just fell in love. The combat plays out better than a standard MMO, the questing system was unique and didn't feel monotonous, the maps are beautiful, and the storyline was just really engaging. Once I hit 80 I got the expansions and discovered HoT meta and stuff and honestly I still do it every day. Got into raiding and fractals at some point too and they're just really fun (with the right group). PvP can be fun and you can do it at any level. I'm slowly starting to enjoy WvW too. It's really just a well rounded game imo, as much as I complain about "balance" patches. The community is comparatively nice to most other MMOs I've played too so finding a cool, active, chill guild is pretty simple.
---
Do I need to have any masteries? I haven't level up my legendary crafting not the fractal masteries.
---
I have 24 characters now so switching on the daily isn't work while. Flip side, I bought the licences when they first came out.. and it's not worth it, lol.
---
HoT was an adventure man. You couldn't just go there and chill, you had to be on your guard all the time and be careful in order to avoid getting killed. The mobs were really unforgivable and if you wanted to get to places you had to do lots of research and exploring. Some content you couldn't do alone or it was really tough to do alone, so you had to either call on a friend or perhaps wait for other explorers. 
---
Personally, i loved the feel of HoT. The huge maps were really well designed and required thorough exploration if you wanted to get to places. Yes it was challenging, unforgiving and sometimes annoying, but a war-torn jungle isn't supposed to be a walk in the park. It was really immersive and fun to figure everything out and to die over and over again in the process while slowly unraveling the jungle's secrets. There was so much to do in these maps and the metas were AMAZING. The map-chat coordination required to do these kinds of metas and successfully completing them really felt nice and rewarding.
---
PoF was sooo boring to me, and while the mounts are great they allow you to skip every encounter. The maps felt really empty and dull to me (to be fair i guess that's what a desert is supposed to be) and I simply didn't have the same feeling of always having to be on your guard. 
---
So for me the answer here is clear, and I really hope the next expansion will be more HoT-oriented!
---
Actual you play them both dps in good parties

Yeah, but if one heals it's the renegade
---
We know of *at least* Episode 6 of season 4 coming out soon followed by 6 more episodes in season 5 spread out with 2-3 months between them. So we have a content plan for at least the next year+ with additional balance patches, game mode additions (future updates to WvW, PvP, Fractals, and Raids in that time frame). We haven't had an expansion announced yet but it would be after season 5 so at least a year. No plans for GW3 and I wouldn't expect it. Again the base game is free and the 2 current expansions mainly affect max level (80) content. Feel free to try it out and then decide if you want to play it, think of the base game as an extended free trial and the expansions as the real game to unlock.
---
Cdkeys has a sale on POF rn, if you're comfortable with key websites. I bought it for my gf a few days ago with no problem, and usually buy gems there as well. 
---
Not for everybody but an option.
---
Indeed ! Well explained, and I said in another reply I wanted to do it as fast as possible, this is why I tend to make the full vendors tabs each day
---
Something else people can do to smooth out the shop a bit is open the shop window, minimize/tab out, open task manager, look at the details tab and find the two CoherentUI_Host.exe instances, right click on the one that is using the most ram and set priority to high. Good for when you're trying to do auction house stuff, too

I must not let fear poison my heart, not even in this forsaken wasteland.
