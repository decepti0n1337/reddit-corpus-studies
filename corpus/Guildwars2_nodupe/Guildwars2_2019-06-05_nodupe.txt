It's not so bad if you ease yourself into it. You can go pretty far playing a fresh air tempest that just swaps between air and fire. Mix in earth and water when you feel comfortable. Then start tossing in conjures.
---
I'd also suggest marauder gear to start rather than berserker. Ele's squishiness can be tough to deal with.

There is, as long as there is the same amount of rewards in the wing as a normal wing in addition to the 'event rewards'.

As a person who works in hospitality/service...I have no clue what you're trying to say.  Do you mean that a busy time is a great time to be terrible your staff, or that it's a great time to take advantage of the business?  Either way, you're a horrible person who should be immediately banned from all decent establishments.
---
Go to the maps that have the most frequent events with lots of enemy waves that drop volatile magic, and bring a profession that can both tag when there's lots of players, and quickly solo events with waves of enemies.
---
I recommend using the crafting calculator on gw2efficiency.com.
---
To be honest, i’m kind excited because we’ll finally be able to see what the branded are truly capable of.
---
As other junky idea that should have been dropped in the bin. Anet is trying but not hard enough.  How about more player design contests?
---
I have my graphics set so low all I see are red circles on a minecraft server, and yours still runs better than mine lol
---
There's no point to repeatedly complaining when no action is being taken, that doesn't mean that there aren't a large number of people who continue to be upset about it. Until this thread, nobody was complaining about the armors' dye channels either.
---
I can semi agree with the sentiment of that, yet for older gamers such as myself (a single father of three) and my friend the feasibility of clearing most content in the same amount of time it takes to watch a lengthy movie is tantalizing to say the least. I would say that there are MMO's out there for the more hardcore audience, but the reality is that is not the case. The reason, I would posit, is because the casual gamer makes up for the majority of the market - and markets tend to follow the money.
---
 I am not that deep into the game, about to hit level 80 tonight, so I cannot speak to the difficulty of the Actual Game, but from what I have thus far experienced, GW2 is a game that *respects* the time I have invested in it. I *can* die in PvE, unlike modern WoW with regards to leveling, and there is a taste of content for every niche, exploration, market manipulators (remember the auction house in WoW? Hasn't been relevant for a *decade*) dungeoneers/raiders with fractals, and a fun world to bounce around in. 
---
For me, the casual, GW2 is the quintessential MMO and one which I am happen to settle down in and call home.   
---
TL;DR:  
---
I respectfully disagree with but understand your position on this matter.

Hi-Res character textures do not work with 2-core processors.

They already give AP for being picked as the Doppleganger.
---
For centaurs, naga, forgotten and other non-humanoid body shapes, the problem isn't clipping, but having to redo armor parts for them.
---
It's easier to slightly adjust charr armor to match tengu than making new pieces for hooves romps, tails and slithering bodies.
---
It's better for all those people wanting to do it on certain times of a day, but worse for those who are just present on the map regardless of meta because it happens less frequently now that it's on a 2h timer. The whole meta starting with escorts and ending at defeating the doppelganger lasts about an hour (even less with people who know what to do). And now the Augury Rock just stays closed for another hour, while before Kaidenna was ready to begin another journey just 15-20min later.
---
It's been said before and it'll be said again: The trenchcoat transform should've been the other way around. It should've dramatically flown off in the wind when entering combat, and regenerated outside of it.
---
Yes yes, at first, the raptor rides you, just like in Soviet Russia. :p
---
Far too low.
---
lmao
---
Yeah you could specially on worldboss where you just can spam 1 and let others do the rest
---
It could turn into some form of player housing even it could really be epic! Wave defense in the guid halls, guild vs guild pvp, housing, raised deco limits, include the dev decos and map building models so we can actually build with them too (imagine having access to the stairs of lost precipice), make interiors of all the houses that are fake in there, upgradable airship and customization, etc.
---
Unless you live in EU then you will never get it, because we are excluded when ever there is a promotion.
---
haha no
---
if you have skyscale go to jahai to tornado and collect every orb. there's also lots in thunderhead keep and some other places
---
You can also buy them from the fractal vendor but that will take 39 days for 77 clovers since you can only buy 2 a day. This reduces down to 35 days if you pick the chest of legendary crafting materials from the login rewards

My god... it’s the first glider I’ve loved since phoenix kite. And hopefully, it’ll go on just as good a sale!

---
I didn't mind those collections as an idea, but all three of them took you to the same spots. One of them would have been fine.
---
That means absolutely nothing in the context of what you claimed.
---
I've outlined this for you many times on the forums.  But I will do it again here.  By simply doing weekly spirit woods, escort, and twisted castle it is possible to get 3 LI per week without even touching a raid boss.  50 weeks for 150 LI, i.e. slightly less than a year to hit the LI requirement without ever doing a single boss.  Then by buying raid clears from a selling guild, it is possible to complete the collections at a price that only doubles the total cost of the armor.  A price that is only doubled to completely skip all the raiding and farm the money through other avenues is quite reasonable.  Before you shout that it isn't reasonable, there is a reason the LFG is full of raid sellers, because there are raid buyers who find it reasonable enough.  The only reason you don't have legendary armor at this point is unwillingness to get it.
---
Is it bad that now I can only think of Shiny having a coat like [Kulve Taroth](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/33171098/eb23e7e466d028d1608125eb9574a7baa7818dd5.jpg) from Monster Hunter World now?

Isn't NCSOFT Anet's parent company?, if anything he went up the ladder
---
imagine being the person who logs into GW2 casually. You sign in and checkout whats new in the gemstore. you see cat boy ears and you get so excited you spill your orange juice all over your keyboard as you run to get you credit card. you put catboy ears on all your characters, get half hard, and then log out.
---
Is it really?  Thanks man. Doesn’t that mean he won’t focus on GW anymore?  Just feels like he did a lot with the community.
---
So reset just happened and I did the Sayida heart in Thunderpeak, but it's not letting me buy more branded masses. Doesn't each day start at reset time? I'm so confused.
---
Do you have any source on this?
---
What skin is that?
---
I hope the meta event rush is a common occurrence. I remember events in gw1 being quite common maybe once or twice a month there was a bonus applied to doing something.
---
Cheapens the 'legendary' though, If you could directly pay for it. Speaking as someone who doesn't own any.
---
Part 1 (Newborn Skyscales) was the worst offender especially since the subcollections had to be completed in sequence. It could've done with some restructuring like:
---
* Part 1A: Find X shedded scales OR interact with NPC Skyscales to collect samples. (5 &lt; X &lt; 15). Return to Gorrik. More scales/interactions can be done for more tiers or as a separate, non-collection-blocking achievement.
---
* Part 1B: No changes.
---
* Part 1C: Gorrik develops the cure in X hours (~2 ideally, one Tyrian day). Player has to apply cure to Y different Skyscales in the map, half to the rideable ones, and half to the sick ones (10 &lt; Y &lt; 20). Applying medicine to the "rest" of the Skyscales is also a separate, non-collection-blocking achievement.
---
* Part 1D: Unlocks concurrently with 1C. Gorrik doesn't mention anything about the eggs until completing 1C. Player can pick them up though, with a prompt like: "Hmm, maybe Gorrik could use these for some research. I'm _sure_ it won't disturb their ecosystem..." Gorrik reprimands the player if they gathered eggs before completing 1C, saying something about "Reckless disturbance for a potentially fragile species".
---
The rest of the steps were fine. Part 2 took you to a bunch of different places, 3 was pretty neat literally seeing the hatchling grow, and 4 was reminiscent of the Precocious Aurene story chapter + related collections. 5B (Flight) was a bit dense too, but I didn't mind it much.
---
The pirate hook skin. It shows up in the gem store once in a while.
---
Publishing Divisions of ANet and NCSOFT were merged during the recent layoffs iirc. Looking at his job title, it may have been just that for him.
---
Alright, I understand. I guess this is just a case of me learning a different game economy and it seemed weird to me to have so many non tradeable items. 
---
It's also still odd to me that everything is salvaged.

it will take longer than 3 days even if you farm on 5 characters
---
From what I've seen in forums etc, it seems that they're planning to make this kind of events something recurring. And not only pve, but also pvp and wvw.
---
Aren't police cars further down the line though ?
---
Thank you so much! worked like a charm
---
I'm fine with that. A full map doing Legendary Bounties is a mixed bag. I'm more comfortable doing them with six to ten players as the scaling at that point is forgiving enough that it isn't that big a deal. Granted there are some Legendary bounties I refuse to do period (Here's looking at you Earth Djinn in Vabbi)...
---
*Phrasing!*
---
ill be honest, i play guildwars cause mashing buttons on my omron switch mechanical keyboard gives a sense of satisfaction that nothing else in the world can replace.
---
I came from Tera, and so far the most fun combat profession wise for me have been guardian &amp; warrior.
---
Coalescence is done. They just wait to update Jewelry at 500 to drop it. With the new W7 I think we'll get a new legendary triket, so a fourth.
---
No lie - thought this was Guild Wars Gone Wild for a moment
---
It both looks like a sword, and enough like a specific variant that I could tell which one from the first click.  Well played.
---
Go back to the official forums please, your memetastic rants about exclusion won't fly here.
---
I suspect we won't see skyscale included in the skin packs such as Branded/Wintersday/Halloween etc mount skins, the same way the roller-beetle doesn't get included in any new versions of these themed multipacks. However, it might be included in the next set of adoption licenses, which means eventually we might have a sparkling rainbow galaxy variant (as well as fire, ice, lightning etc versions).
---
Sorry for the double reply but here is one of the builds.  I use mace/focus and scepter/shield.
---
Zeal --- middle,bottom, bottom
---
Radiance --- top, middle, top
---
Valor --- top, middle, top
---
Signet of resolve, stand your ground, retreat, save yourselves,  feel my wrath.  Are my skills.  It's an old old old tanky build I use.  Its decent enough.
---
For better healing, put the last valor on middle instead of top.  Change 7,8,9 to smite condition, merciful intervention and judge's intervention 
---
I would keep feel my wrath as my elite and signet of resolve as my heal.
---
Again not top tier stuff but gives that extra bit of survival that is often needed.
---
Good idea to check that. Thank you. Yep, it's listed as "Thaw Elixer: Snow Leapard Cub that follows you around the instance". All of the other cats show up just fine, and the cub worked in the past.
---
Odd.
---
Yes. The backs and bellies of the dragons are the two channels.
---
The trinket also requires an additional 3k kralk and 360 branded mass, if you haven’t completed dragons blood or astral weapons
---
This is really good advice. The other metas are going to fill up almost instantly, which either means A) you'll need to wait in the map forever and miss other metas, or B) you won't be able to get in.
---
I know people that became managers and they all think exactly like this.
---
In all honesty what the point of endgame PvE if you don't raid ? I can understand that the casual playerbase don't want to raid, but they really had to stop to complain about it.
---
  
---
Cause at the end, what keep players in the game IS endcontent, GW2 is struggling with it CAUSE there is NOTHING tied to, people join on LS update then leave to wait the next one. In GW1 we were used to acquire the best skins, titles, ranks, pets and all in grindy or " hard " content in specific modes and that's one of the reason the playerbase stayed that much. No one complained about FoW armor but everyone wanted it, feeling of achievement.
---
And I will go further and make you ever more disagreeing : Even the raid lootable is hard casualised ( something like green item in 1 ) plus raid tokens to buy things ( prices are also low ). I don't know if that's the reason why they locked to account raid skins but otherwise the price will be 10g after 1 week so I don't mind.
---
Instead of giving low lootable ( so the most expansive items ) to specific open world spam 1 for 40 minutes events, give them to raids. Or much better bring casual raids mechanics to open world events like TT or Scarlet on LS1.
---
that sounds amazing tbh
---
Is there any specific order to participate in the different metas for the weeklong event or is it easy enough to join whichever one is up?
---
[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/434455986](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/434455986)
---
Yeah. Part of me longs for those days because 1. I wasn't into the game back then and so I'm ignorant about the downsides of those days and 2. because a lot of gear drops feel unrewarding because it's not useful. Blues, greens and yellows aren't "gear" so much as they're material bags.
---
Dragonhunter has the best burst in the game, along with great cleave. If used right, no story boss should be a struggle. 
---
First of all, drop virtues trait line for the “optional” zeal trait line they have on there. Imo this is not optional. Zeal has so much damage boosts it shouldn’t be skipped.
---
2nd you must understand how the build works. It achieves amazing dps through its many Damage buffs. The important damage buffs are from: having retaliation, target being f1 speared, and target being in a symbol. So, your goal is to put all of your big damage skills within a spear and a symbol. Therefore your rotation would look something like: f1 (spear and burning boost), greatsword (gs) 4 (symbol and retaliation boost), trap (dps), gs2 (big dps). This 4 skill rotation will easily melt any veteran mob. If the enemy is still alive, swap to sword focus, then kinda just spam (except f1) until you see your trap go off cd. Then swap to gs again and do the burst rotation again. One thing to maybe note is to check your retaliation uptime. You can get retal through using your heal skill or using stand your ground (syg) for the retal damage boost. This isn’t exactly the meta rotation, but it’s much simpler. If you want the full rotation, check [snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/dragonhunter/power/), a website for meta raid builds. I would recommend this site’s builds over metabattle for anything pve. 
---
3rd thing is about sustainability. Not only do you have 2 dodged to dodge any attacks coming in, you should also be dodging out of the aoe’s being shown too. Furthermore, you have lots of tools to help you survive. Your heal skill is arguably the best heal in the game. Basically, if you’re dpsing while under its effects, you’re invincible. Use it when you need the heals. Your f2 is a heal and condi cleanse, and your f3 blocks any attacks from the front. The f3 is especially helpful if used right. Also remember, dps = survivability, since the faster your enemies die, the less damage you take. 
---
4th, maybe you don’t have the right gear. A lot of players don’t have runes or sigils, thinking they’re only a small change. However, they are both extremely powerful, especially the runes. If you haven’t gotten the flame legion runes from the guide yet, I would recommend superior runes of vampirism for story and basic open world. It doesn’t break the bank, but gives you some dps and a lot of survivability. 
---
If you want to practice a bit with me, pm me. I will gladly help you out in game. Good luck!
---
Everything. There is so much VM you can get from random nodes and events and map currency
---
It took me 15 minutes to come up with.
---
For all of Aion's problems aesthetics was far from being one of them.
---
Yeah, Vinewrath is on the list.
---
To lead us to a prophecy!
---
I haven’t played in ages but planned on starting back again soon with some friends. In your thread title are you implying the game’s pretty dead right now?
---
Once you buy the saddle, yeah. They're not hard at all - they're usually pretty close to waypoints, but there's just sooooo many.
---
Thank you for your response! I found the pvp lobby today and spammed unranked most of the day. It is a blast forsure!

No pls stop

A squad of jacaranda is called an impossible ;\^)

Similar but with two holding the tail I think
---
the problem with comparing this to a legendary is that it's *not* a legendary. this kind of grind and timegate is acceptable *only* for legendaries. the fact that the skyscale cannot even fly infinitely is just the cherry on top, nothing about the mount feels legendary.
---
Yeah it was amazing making my way across the map to press f 20 times per collection. Oh wait it wasn't . It was the most tedious, dated and lazy thing they have EVER done.

The final final instance of the story has such amazing music. It starts playing after a bit and you’ll hear lyrics. It’s so beautiful.

*B E L L Y   D A N C I N G*
---
No offence but your sarcasm needs work.
---
I returned to the game after years. So I had a whole bunch of birthday presents for each of my character.
---
From those I got items that allowed me to choose a skin to unlock. When I choose, I get this item that says "Double click to consume".  
---
If the skin if for a sword, and I have a sword equipped, the skin is applied. If I don't have a sword equipped, it's not applied.
---
My questions:
---
* When I double click and unlock the skin, is it bound to my character, or to my account?
---
* If I consume the skin but don't have the related item equipped, does it sill unlock the skin for my account?
---
* Can I destroy those items once I unlocked the skin? They're filling my inventory quite a lot.
---
* Does it work the same way for dyes?
---
Any answer would be appreciated, thanks :)
---
Most players did hence the uproar when it was released.
---
Keep in mind, as you can probably guess, these aren't objective takes on the class, just takes on the way I played them  
---
Ranger: +pets (always love pet classes in games) +consistent damage by yourself, add in a decent meat shield.  -Pretty simple overall class (I didn't touch too hard on either elite spec, though Soul looks pretty cool)  
---
Thief: +great damage +great mobility +generally cool looking -pretty squishy if forced to tank   
---
Necro: +pets -pets seemingly aren't amazing +absolute edgelord aesthetic that hits on the edgy teen hidden deep in the depths of my mind +super hard to kill  
---
Guardian: +good at buffing +again, looks pretty cool +dragonhunter is interesting (though I can't remember doing well with it) -I feel as though I don't do a lot of solo damage  
---
I like the ideas of pretty much all of the classes in the game, barring the Warrior. I don't know what it is, but I've never liked being a plain warrior.
---
Just read his job description for his position at NCSOFT, it answers your question:
---
“Shifted over from ArenaNet to the parent company. Same position...but now working on Guild Wars, Guild Wars 2, Aion, Lineage, Blade &amp; Soul and the unannounced Harmonix partnership.”
---
Am I right in that the Zhed's armor set is exactly the same as Berserker Exalted but cheaper and comes with runes I can replace later? Is there anything I'm missing here? Is this the best thing to buy for a new 80 necromancer?
---
Alts and map completions. Lots of alts and lots of map completion.
---
Power scourge is only viable in PvP modes. Mostly wvw.
---
Anywhere else I'd play condi. Does a lot more dmg
---
Taking into account not having many alts, just doing the hearts will earn you 20 or so currency a day (75for Istan)
---
If you havent finished the maps, 25 of the currency for map completion. 
---
About one meta run and some dailies for Dragonfall  and you can knock it our in 3 or 4 days, you can buy 5 of each map currency per day from the dragonfall magic vendir.
---
Each map you can get about 30 or so currency farming per day, maybe 50. 
---
I'd say focus on one or two ma0s a day and dont overdo it, the mount isnt going to be a necessity, its just cool to have, so dont burn yourself out on it.
---
[masteries](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mastery) require either HoT or PoF; and require you to finish the first story mission in one of those.
---
daily metas also help.
---
home instance nodes also help (for the lazy among us)
---
Be honest. Are they wrong? Maybe it's frustrating. But does it actually affect how much/little you play the game?
---
I'm doing a heal FB also. I picked maklains because the vitality is really important I feel for a guard to have, because they have very low base vatality. Nothing is more embarrassing than when you're a medic and your team has to heal you more than you heal them lol
---
I can’t wait! But I have soo much to do before moving on. Haha. I’m thinking of buying season 2 just for the story.
---
Yup, that's right. There are some other ways to get cheap or "free" gear but getting one of the [named sets](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Named_armor) off the trading post is one of the fastest and best options. Since they just drop off enemies they are cheaper than the crafted pieces that require materials that cost a decent amount. If you want more gearing options and suggestions check out this guide: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character
---
this is correct, zhed's armor is just berserker's armor that can drop as loot
---
damn. this is just woah; I should have been doing this with my currencies. lol
---
Yeah, I'll be the first to call out a lot of the shit on this game (I played for two years or so from launch and had to quit when I could no longer socket my gear due to a glitched account and brutal rng. I was extremely active in getting pug squads into the Abyss, running pvp training runs, etc.)
---
As clear as crystal.
---
Cheers, mate!
---
they should add a Guild Hall located in the Mists (using WvW balance); its purpose would be:
---
- GvG w/ appropriate balance.
---
- Currency Sinks: WvW &amp; PvP specific Decorations (Walls, Gates, Siege, Lord Statues etc.)
---
- a guild hall where they can see the WvW maps with portals to their team's spawn-points. (instead of using the UI menu)
---
everything else would be the same as PvE guild halls; they're a part of the map and accessible only to you + whoever you invite to it. t
---
Good rundown.
---
Ranger: You probably won't like Soulbeast if you're a pet fan. Druid is more a support spec.
---
Thief: You might like Daredevil. Double down on all the things you liked, plus more durable.
---
Necro: Minion master reaper is one of the strongest open world / solo pve specs in the game. Fleshy is a beast.
---
Guard: check out a meditrapper DH. Tons of burst. 
---
Others: Sounds like you like wrecking face, not dying, and looking cool while you do it. It may seem strange, but you might check out fresh air tempest. Sustain for days, giant lightning storms, high mobility, flashiest kit in the game, and enough complexity to keep things interesting. Ele was my 2nd to last of 9 80s, but once I got over my aversion to Squishies I promptly got world completion on mine.
---
yeah I picked up the ones I found the most tedious to farm (and those that released when I had limited playtime) just so I could passively farm them every day. worth it if you have the gold/magic to spare.
---
That's what I did. I wanted as much story as I could possibly get!
---
Specs look fine, but that gpu is going to struggle when things get crazy. I'd try to invest a little more into the graphics card, even my 1070 starts sputtering on big maps.
---
i see, do you know if the season 2 goes on sale or do they never go on sale?
---
Well I would say it's ok if you want test or just have fun.
---
But it's not optimal. You don't need that such extra survivability from toughness/vita, the extra heal you get is neat but not necessary either, you could lack some boon duration too :(
---
And moreover more power is cool to be able to help a bit your teammates in DPS ;)
---
It depends what you want ;)
---
Raids are incredibly casual though
---
The raid community did a great job destroying itself
---
How does one do weekly key farms? Because I rarely ever come across these keys. PvP tracks?
---
Fun...? What?

Thank you for all you guys do!
---
[Key Farming on the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Key_farming)
---
basically once a week after the server week reset you create a new character an take them to level 10 to complete the level 10 personal story which at the end nets you 1 key.  deposit the key into the bank and then delete the character and leave the character slot open for next week's key farming character.
---
If doing all the JPs yourself and not using the food to call the skyscale, you will get through this quite cheap. I used only once the food that I got from the collection unlock to get the skyscale from Augry Rock. 
---
The 5g parts which counted for 30g max. Only other way you lost gold was from WPing for the collection. 
---
The currency stacks were no hard way to get or have since they've been out since .5-1.5 years most of them, Mistborn beeing awfully easy to get.
---
The other collection were "Search&amp;Find" style, which is a good way to make you explore the map and see the cool places, even if you are using a guide. Devs said they won't make you stay in one place all day to farm a single item just to complete a quest. And they haven't done it IIRC.
---
&gt; By which I mean the people who identify themselves as raiders and expect the game to conform to them.
---
That's funny, as this guys sits here and expects the game to conform to him because he feels he should be able to get *legendary* armor without having to do any content that isn't his personal niche.
---
Thank you rude asura for informing us
---
Thanks for the rundown, I really appreciate it! I'm sinking more time into this game now that my job is slowing down (for now haha) and I want to be able to try all of these things!  
---
Soulbeast is disappointing to hear about, but oh well! Reaper sounds like something I need to give a go stat! Dhunter and Tempest sound really cool too!
---
I know plenty of non-raiders both more hardcore and more accomplished than people who consider themselves raiders. Not raiding does not make someone "a casual" . Raiding is one type of content, no more important than any other. It's nothing special.
---

Taimi, where is my Bunny?

Also get Superior Rune of the Pack if you want to support, Guides mention Rune of the Eagle/Sholar but full Diviner Chrono deals like 15k dps tops so adding Sholar Rune for 7g each (+/- 45g total) will only grant a ~750 dps increase.
---
Pack Runes are better for Fury and Might uptime, also they have offensive Stats much like Eagle/Sholar and are way cheaper.

It is the human female /surprised emote.

The layoffs didn’t cause any major changes in the expectation for content for GW2.
---
The layoffs were focused on other aspects of Arenanet’s business. The GW2 team has been doing a lot more advertising recently which I believe is the cause of a lot of new and returning players. 
---
There is still an expectation of plenty more content to come to GW2.
---
As for falling behind the content curve... I’m not sure what you mean by this. Pretty much all the content in GW2 can be played at anytime either solo or with a PUG group or even just with one or two friends so in my opinion there is no ‘content curve’ so to say. 
---
There is no real ‘Gear Curve’ either if this is what you meant, ascended gear is pretty easy to get and I’ve got 2 fully geared up characters with ascended gear that had zero ascended gear when I returned.
---
Can I use change precursor armor (change runes, setup stats, change looks) and still use it in Legendary Armor recipe?
---
Most of the replayability for me came from buildcrafting and playing all the builds I can think of, so my answer has to be:
---
ELITE SPECIALIZATIONS in any shape or form. With or without expansion I don't care, just let me build more characters.
---
It is actually. Assuming 1 week is enough to get maybe one or two items to whet someone's appetite for the full set. 
---
The raiding community destroyed itself with it's elitism and now ANet has to sneakily entice casuals to bolster your ranks. That's a failure on your part, not ANet's.
---
Massive FPS gains with this.. 20-25 FPS in congested areas, over 40 FPS in some spots. My RTX 2080 loves it dearly. Thanks.
---
My typical open world build have blood magic wells traits  and not a single minion. Healing and damaging well, grasp, condi cleanse well and either another well or grasp. Elite can be lich or shout.
---
I'd prefer capture pre-events somewhat included as well. Yesterday I failed tagging priest and ended up with no reward for pushing meta for 40 minutes.
---
Dungeons and Fractals are just Raids with a different name. What would be the point of making them part of the alternative? It would be like saying "You don't like jumping puzzles? Fine, you can now get JP chests at the top of long sequences of complex architecture that you have to jump across." 
---
The alternate methods would need to involve the NON-dungeon style content in the game, the open world content that people come to GW2 to play. For examples, see the skyscale acquisition and the Legendary Trinkets.
---
The world was made for people who just get login rewards friendo
---
Variant discussions aside, I just want to emphasize that druid's current protection uptime is horrible while this build basically gives 100% prot uptime with a chrono (and maybe by itself with warhorn variant).
---
The offensive buffs of the druid are not a necessity : even in CM, more often than not, just being able to withstand damage better ends up in more DPS than spotter+frost spirit.
---
The discussions going on about staff vs D/WH and fire vs air vs arcane just show how versatile tempest healer can be.
---
Personally I feel like it just makes the run a lot smoother/more pleasant and I couldn't tell if we would be any faster with a druid but I seriously doubt it would be significant so I can't encourage people enough to just try healing tempest in combination with a chrono for support roles in fractals.
---
That being said, I haven't tested renegade/firebrand compositions so I can't speak for those.
---
Ugh. The reason I don't play Herald spec on my revenant is Glint's voice. I know I can disable it, but I kinda like player chatter. btw. revenant is cool.
---
I assume rewards get shipped each time a tier is finished. So if you participate at anytime you will get all rewards from lower tierrs when current tier finishes. As said, thats just my guess.
---
Triumphant armor looks nice too. From the WvW reward track.
---
Unlike in eso where champion points give you minor stat points, you get new quality of life features. They include stuff like auto loot, longer gliding, using small portals, leyline gliding, unlocking vendors, legendary crafting, fractal bonuses, raid bonuses, new mounts and their special abilities etc
---
Nice try Anet
---
The issue isn't EVEN if it's bannable. Because even if it technically isnt, the support team don't really care. They will ban you and take everything.
---
You gotta get this.
---
CS won't appeal their own decision. The ONLY way they will even consider it is if you throw a fit on Reddit and turn it into bad publicity. Then they might respond to you with bs and ask the Reddit mods to close the threads. They don't give a crap about you or your account. Don't play with fire, because getting burnt this time means losing everything.
---
&gt; These shiny weapons will eventually be locked behind a raid wing? (Possibly add on from w6?? Or w7?)
---
As I understand from this:
---
&gt; The weapons will always be available through the Key of Ahdashim raid after the event has ended. Happy collecting!
---
If you don't raid you can collect them during the event. After the event has ended you can collect in w7 only
---
When does the gem store rotation usually happen? It's on a certain day of the week right? I want to buy the upcoming Raven Mantle
---
Do you know what a producer does? I'll tell you what they don't do: make armor. What he actually did was guide the artists, designers, etc. that *were* making legendary armor, to plan the logistics and keep everyone on track. Explain to me how a producer leaving means there are no longer people who can or want to work on legendary armor, or why this means ArenaNet will not be working on it. You are misinformed and you are also making assumptions with a lack of information. I know for a fact that the act of a producer leaving does not in any way mean that ArenaNet would not consider continuing the project that producer happened to be managing. Companies don't just stop bothering with a project just because the person managing it left. They find a new person to manage it.
---
I've just updated with a build link ;)
---
Mostly from renown hearts and meta events. You can complete them on every character each day.
---
&gt;Just wait for it, they cannot cover all game modes at once. Legendary Weapons Gen1 are tied to a Gift of Exploration and both accessoires to tons of LS Content. I know quite a few pvp/wvw guys that would never play this content. And I know a few Raiders that doesn't touch Open World much.
---
Right, they need to expand those too, offer alternate ways to unlock those items. 
---
The thing is, rewards are not fungible. You can never say "it's ok that you can't get 'A' doing the thing you enjoy, because you can get 'B' that way!" If you like A and have no interest in B, then the availability of B is completely irrelevant to you. That's why there need to be paths to get all items at least *primarily* through pursuing any major type of content. It's important that players be able to get the items they *want,* not just the items *available.*
---
&gt;Playing a gamemode you initially don't like to get unique things is the best way to promote content. I often hear that gw2 has no content from people that doesn't touch 3/4 of the existing content.
---
This works, but only to a point. There's definitely a good reason to get players to *try* new content, but there's no reason whatsoever to get players to *keep* doing content they don't enjoy for dozens of hours. Once the player can reasonably determine that they don't enjoy a type of content, they should be able to move on without abandoning reward progress. 
---
I definitely think that it's worth them encouraging players to *try* raids, but the current Legendary track is far from "trying" raids, it requires *committing* to raids for dozens upon dozens of hours, far more than it would take to earn a set of Legendary weapons, for example. If we're using the justification that they want to "get people to try raiding," that's fine, but by that standard, the only thing a player should need that can *only* be acquired through raiding should be something that players of any skill level could acquire after about an hour or two spent inside a raid. If, after that, they *want* to continue raiding, then they can, but if they don't want to, then there is no benefit in keeping them there. 
---
If a player does not enjoy raiding, then there's no benefit to anyone for that player to be raiding. A player should not be doing 100% of the content in the game unless they genuinely enjoy doing 100% of the content. If they skip 3/4 of the content, that's fine, if they wouldn't enjoy that 3/4 anyway.
---
Usually Tuesdays when they update.
---
Your alts don't need to do the story. Buy a teleport scroll or use a tele to friend.
---
Your alts don't need to be geared. Figure out which hearts don't need combat and do those.
---
Even if they're horribly geared, you can probably still kill mobs. Just slower.
---
What’s wrong with minstrel. I love it for the survivability.
---
I specifically adored part2 where we had to take the egg all around the world. The most tedious was part 1 with 3 scavanger hunts on the same map (often same places), the most infuriating one was the feeding ofc (if only we knew about the 250 currencies we could have used that time to get them) and the most redundant was the rifts (just a bit pointless, at least doing 20+ of them with a good chunk being 3m away from the WP).   
---
With the new changes and the information on what's needed being out there I can def say a very good collection, one of my fav.
---
As long as I can hit 100%  on duration, it’s all good?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn5mqT9Elwk
---
It is a great way if you do fractals ... which is also great for gold that  you are also going to need a lot of if you are making anything that needs clovers. :)
---
It really depends on your desired aesthetics. For sylvari you're basically limited to cultural+TA+carapax anyway plus a few gemstore skins. It also depends a lot on armour weight, for light you can find *a lot* of variety e.g. Winged, Lich, Forgeman while medium requires gems or PvP skins to get rid of the trenchcoat. Getting a somewhat realistic tin can for heavy takes a bit of searching too but for edgy with extra spikes there's always [Armageddon armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Armageddon_armor) (and yes you *can* dye it pink!)
---
Futuristic asuran sci-fi stuff comes extremely cheap with Glyphic and Peacekeeper weapons. The [Steam Gizmo](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Steam_Gizmo) has a unique trail effect although "all teh sparklez" snobs might find it "cheap". The [Inquest set](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Inquest_weapons) is a recolour of the now-expensive Mystic set and comes with little red lightning bolts.
---
So basically, what are your aesthetic preferences, do you want to cosplay a specific character, are you only looking for a specific armour weight? Usually it is faster and easier to go through the wardrobe yourself and just cross off skins you cannot afford/don't want to grind for yet unless you're specifically looking for things the preview does not show well (i.e. infusions, sounds, projectile effects etc.)
---
Probably best screen of this moment so far, anybody who disagrees is lying just to be contrarian
---
Well they do stack up eventually
---
Similarly there's the Ascalonian weapons from the dungeon, they look unassuming until night, when they glow blue and put out a cool effect.
---
Again it depends what you want ;) this doesn't have like chrono or firebrand some cap to reach to work.
---
The more you have boon duration, the better it is but it's not "mandatory" to try ;)
---
Although don't forget you have a good amount of boon duration thanks to fractal potion.
---
I prefer 100% boon duration to help maintaining might and protection. But with less boon duration you will still be a decent support don't worry ;)
---
That could very well speak to his return somewhere down the line, though.
---
Can you look the rush events up and rewards somewhere? Iam a returning player and this is new....
---
I'm sorry but I don't call the lvl 60 story endgame, neither the spam 1 for 30 minutes events.
---
In the past players used to speedrun dungeon and tryhard Tequatl and TT which was another thing before the powercreep.
---
The playerbase was literally logging in to dungeon clear then logging off. Tequatl was for guild only and TT unkillable for a while
---
If you dont lose anything you cant get screwed
---
Have fun... the most annoying part of this is the Elderwood. As it's used all over the place. And you don't get it quickly through normal game-play like you might mithril.
---
Sure fam :'D That's why it's only you complaining on wanting easy legendary armor (there is no content that you can do solo that would be nearly hard enough to warrant legendary armor).  
---
Deal with it
---
Screen mirror via wifi?
---
Just prestige things mostly
---
You get a set of legendary armor, but you could do that with PvP or WvW as well, it just comes with a unique skin for example
---
You should do them if you think you would enjoy them
---
This still annoys me to this day. Poor Zojja.
---
This  
---
I'm usually a hardcore raider because I like them, but not in GW2. Tbh they aren't good enough to be put on such a high pedestal as in other MMOs for the mechanics are too simple and the class gameplay too easy thus I have no interest in them. In gw2 raids aren't the endgame like in other MMOs, the slow updates to raids and small amounts of PvE players actually raiding says enough.
---
If you like weapons with a fantasy feel and a bit of glow, Royal Ascalon from the Dungeon is a good option. You can do the Dungeon itself and the PvP Reward track to double-up on the currency (with the added bonus of a possibility to get the armor set pieces).
---
There are some other cool weapons and armor sets that you can farm from PvP and WvW.
---
There's also the karma weapons and armor: Ebon Vanguard, Lionguard, Pirate, etc.
---
There's the Pact weapons, from finishing the Core Personal Story (one per character).
---
Cultural weapons (can be used by any race), cultural armor (race specific), stuff that is locked behind achievements and collections...
---
Some armor sets and weapons are available from the Black Lion Statuettes (usually 30 for the armor, and 25 for the weapon), on a rotation. When they rotate out they become available for a short time on the Black Lion store.
---
The community rewards are not that big, there's no title, no AP just a bit of a nice little bonus for playing. You don't lose anything significant.
---
Well you if don't interact with the hardest content in the game, well Fractal CMs are on par or even harder than raids I would say.
---
So not interacting with what is considered hardcore content, means you only interact with the casual open world content, which makes you a casual.
---
There is nothing wrong with that, it doesn't necesseraly makes you a bad player either, and interacting with hardcore content doesn't mean you're a good player either.
---
Just chose those terms, cause people know them, and it keeps things simple.
---
It's not about playtime or achievement points
---
Big glowing cocks are greatest though... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Keep em'.
---
Some of the best gw2 content hidden in raids, which only a small fraction of players will see, and some of the best stories gw2 has to tell, which will be appreciated by an even smaller number of raiders....
---
Single player modes when?
---
Even if they awarded nothing, just seeing this content would be enough - hell I’d even pay to be able to access it in a similar way to the gw1 bonus mission pack.
---
Whoa, i didnt know such an achievement exist.
---
I found the first episode took some grinding, but I always had 10K magic by the time the next episode dropped after that.
---
Im suffering from that pain, collecting stage 2 of Nevermore.......F for respect
---
After 5 years, I finally got mine in WvW earlier this year. It was a handful maybe 4-5 ANet tags just running around in WvW on SBI looking for fights, they actually did pretty well. I remember their reaper dishing out dmg timely enough while their tempest kept them topped up. One was even on our server (BG) but I think they switched to SBI side shortly after... I can only imagine the sniping/focus you get when you don the ol' ANet tag.
---
Thanks for the hidden achievement.

---
blish has a custom model with like, a cute vest though
---
You can take scourge 1-1-1 and give barriers to yourself and your minions, or whoever else is around. The other traits are condition and support focused (mostly in WvW, lol). If you aren't running an offensive condition build, you're doing defensive-ish barrier stuff.
---
Use axe/whatever you want; dagger for cleanse, warhorn for a bit of cleave healing (New!), focus if nothing is around to die for you. You can run mainhand dagger too, and the heal there scales well with gear.
---
Spite is there by default because power build, and axe is probably your main weapon. Soul reaping's good for shorter fights with death perception boosting crit and crit damage. Blood magic and wells for AoE burst. All very standard.
---
If you don't mind fights taking forever, and just want to grind down champions and the like without much fear, feel free to take death magic and run gear with toughness or healing power. Your barriers get better with healing gear, and your minions will appreciate a well of blood occasionally if you run that with them. But they probably don't have feelings so I dunno. If you go uber-invinci-turtle with blood magic and death magic together, you can have your mini-horde of minions heal you constantly via vampiric presence, all while you pump out sand barriers and wells of blood to absorb even more damage for everyone in your single-consciousness party. Think of it like a scouting run, for when you get power reaper going; you'll have lots of combat experience without having taken much of the risk normally involved. Zealot or even crusader will work. I guess you can even run cleric, but that might be overkill? or not? Power scourge will be a niche build, might as well go all-in on the niche.
---
Well, what can I say. Even though I played since prophecies released, most of my characters were actually from Factions because it was the fastest way to get to max level (one reason my legendary survivor is actually from Cantha).
---
Pe Wan was a running gag when a friend and I played Factions together. "Oh look its peeeeeee waaaaaan"
---
nope, thats what you are, he is completly right and you know it. same shit all the people told you in the dungeon sub.  
---
as long as you can grind something in the openworld where no skill is needed, you are fine with it. if there was a cranked up triple trouble where all people need to pull their weight instead of leeching and the armor was in there, you would say the same: its to hard for a openworld player, we need a alternative.  
---
from what you write: you are just a leech, face it.
---
Stage 2 of Gen 1 and Gen 2.1 legendaries is pretty much just that, and it's a fucking pain.
---
I've been online almost everyday and I haven't seen this event running.
---
I'm assuming it hasn't been fixed yet.
---
Uncheck "Raid Mode"
---
Thank you, Wiki people! This page was tremendously helpful last night when commanding the first meta rush squads.
---
Only way I’ve managed to retain people on this map is to command a squad around for the first events. During the downtime, I then bring them to do the two legendary bounties on the map and maybe a champion bounty or two depending on the time left. 
---
Nets everyone a few Elegy Mosaics and loot while we wait for the amalgamated gemstone.
---
&gt; reddit does have this nifty searchbar
---
c'mon, there are peons on reddit that do all the work for you. Why use the search bar?
---
A tonic that is not gain in any other way?!

The menu for that is found behind the little arrow icon in the party menu in the corner of your screen.
---
Or sis?
---
Are you assuming people have DPS ? Ah !
---
ok
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endless_Bonus_Box_Tonic
---
With time to spare? We finished the first round in like 10 seconds or so :D
---
It gives us an occasion to berate too. Win-win.
---
So what would be the other 3 mystic forge ingredients to create the legendary piece?
---
to be fair most of the dailies kind of happen by accident. Like the magic gathering / awakened killing / daily bounty. Youre on the map playing normal and suddenly "Bam" Daily Completed. After playing for the day I always have a bunch of daily chests in my inventory even though I only do the fractal and core dailies on purpose.
---
We made it today with a chrono who wasn’t able to do his rotation and one new player. It isn’t that difficult.
---
Sure man, whatever you want
---
I suggest not worshipping it as a huge fucking deal. It's a decent tool, like Arc. Not something to be slavishly followed.
---
yeah, i didn't mean that. I mean that a single player can collect all the available coins with time to spare.
---
Anything that is one time only and can never got back is significant for some people. GW2 is sold on the fact that you can do whatever you want, whenever you want. Even today, you can do story, fractals, raids, WvW, and target the achievements you want. Even festivals are yearly.
---
That's not true for this box if it doesn't appear ever after, same with LW1. Hence the concerns in the thread.
---
&gt; ***defiantly***
---
&gt; in a manner that shows open resistance or bold disobedience.
---
&gt; "he defiantly refused to accept any government money"
---
I should’ve got a screenshot when we did it last night, but it hit 3,900 on the last round 🤯
---
Well if you want to stand around as a box, that's significant. Then we better hope the rewards are distributed to all who participatet in any part of the event.
---
F
---
I bet Rosegreen Dye will be even prettier
---
Why would you be able to get legendary armor in pve without doing raids? By that logic I'm gonna say, "I'm a PvP/WvW only player, please let me get skyscale/Aurora/vision without leaving my BLs or Heart of the Mists". It's an idiotic statement, if you want the exclusive rewards, play the specific content.
---
I want everything for free \o/
---
/s
---
I'm sure soon or later they will do an event with free legendarys for just beeing a slacker
---
SnowCrows website links to several discord servers of raid training guilds. I highly recommend joining one and signing up for raid trainings. This helped me so much to get more confidence regards raiding and being in the end-game content groups.
---
The longterm and regular playerbase, yeah something like that maybe a bit less, I'm pretty confident about it.
---
I'm not talking about the play on update 1 week then leave until the next one playerbase which is obviously 90% story/open.
---
The fact is, sadly, a lot of end-gamers focus on offensive stat as much as possible and keep their survivability only on placement/dodge/heal/aegis ... Which is understandable, for sure.   
---
Eventhough I understand some people prefer sacrifice some power (which, on a support class, doesn't really shine) to gain a huge gap in survivability ;)
---
So everyone hated this at the start but now we all have the damn mount we loved it? k.
---
Maybe show us a screenshot of how it looks like when you click on that little arrow? Visuals can help more than just a description :)
---
&gt;Grinding raids still harder than grinding events lmao
---
In both cases it really depends on how much you're contributing. 
---
&gt;Ngl tho I love it when antisocials in mmo's like you seethe that it isn't a single player game
---
There's nothing "social" about raiding, it's all completing tasks. I don't want single player, I enjoy having other players around, I just don't enjoy coordination and reliance.
---
&gt;Why would you be able to get legendary armor in pve without doing raids? 
---
Why would you be able to get legendary armor in pve *by* doing raids? It's entirely arbitrary which tasks they attach which rewards to.
---
&gt;By that logic I'm gonna say, "I'm a PvP/WvW only player, please let me get skyscale/Aurora/vision without leaving my BLs or Heart of the Mists". 
---
Yeah?
---
You... can't tolerate doing daily hearts? Wat? These calculations are based on guaranteed currency which is JUST doing hearts and a map completion here and there.   
---
Who is forcing you to grind these? Do it at your own pace it'll just take you longer.
---
&gt;If you are a open world only player, what do you need legendary armor for,
---
For equipping onto characters.
---
if you value time so much, you should stop playing online games altogether tbh.
---
I stopped playing the game (and buying gems) because arenanet's attention span is even shorter than mine. I got absolutely done with them leaving trails of unfinished or abandoned content in their wake and just gave up.
---
Well, I consider "fun" to be of value to me. If I'm enjoying myself, then I'm getting my value's worth. But I would not enjoy raiding, so if I'm raiding, then the only value it could possibly bring me is the rewards, and if it fails to bring me the rewards, then it hasn't provided any value at all. 
---
Some people do enjoy raiding, and they should be able to do so, but not everyone does, and they shouldn't have to.
---
Good thing raids aren't the only source x)   
---
Git gud at SOMETHING fam, surely doing events isn't the maximum of your ability
---
Heal Firebrand plus Renegade is the common CM+T4 variant (Firebrigade).  It's 1.5 healers; both with access to decent amounts of stability, boon-strip or projectile destruction (Jalis, Mallyx or Ventari).  If CM players are running extra sustain then is it really so unreasonable for non-CM pugs run an extra boon-support or healer in favor of a smoother run in harder Fractals like Oasis or SR? 
---
What you want in a pug group isn't speed.  It's stability both literally and figuratively, and if you have to drop a DPS to hit a certain survivability equilibrium then so be it.  The argument that you're losing speed is moot when you've wiped 2-3+ times.  The whole, "Gotta go fast," mentality doesn't really apply to inexperienced groups because they're usually incapable of going fast.
---
I've always loved that laso mission when you ride the mount in the 3rd chapter of POF. Would be awesome if they could implement a bounty in POF maps where you need your whole guild to teather to a certain mob.
---
Raids are considered the pinnacle of pve content. Currently there are ways to get legendary armor through all 3 major game types, pve, pvp, And wvw. Raids, fractals, and open world are all part of pve with raids sitting at the top, therefore legendary armor is achievable “primarily through pursuing any major type of content” in the sense that it is acquirable through pve. Open world is not separate enough to merit its own set of armor since the pinnacle of pve already has a way to earn it.
---
Out of all of the ways the game could improve, all the neglected communities that just don’t get substantial enough updates on par with living world, your answer to what the game lacks is capes.
---
 You know what? If they did open world more hardcore (like vanilla HoT but even harder, more rewarding, more time consuming) then yes, capes could definately be a part of that. I’d actually like new maps which you can only enter with a guild, a guild squad from the guild teleporter, and have dragon stand/dragonfall like metas.
---
And all OP could manage was a measely 40. Ugh.
---
I really want them, so I considered dropping my courses in cetacean linguistics to get a STEM degree and go work at Anet myself, but communicating with humans is a lot of work, and they say things like "how do you do?" and "what smells like ambergris?" Making a reddit post is a pretty close approximation of being an expert anyway, I think.
---
You can buy every single first gen legendary weapon from the trading post, including eternity.
---
Ok so at least I can confirm it now, you are an elitist cause you called yourself an : " hardcore raider " stating that : " random MMO is legit cause harder " and now getting more and more caricatural and childish : " U noob playing GW2 raid lol ", " I hurt ur feeling me better playing the real game ;p ", " your mindlessly " in a monologue that has nothing to do with what I just said ( which is funny btw ). I'm I wrong ? Cause you seem really upset about it and there is no reason to, that was not even a poke.
---
I'm just saying that raids are still the hardest content of GW2, easy or not. Definitely not the only MMO I raided in but I consider myself as a pure casual like GW2 raids are so don't worry you don't hurt my feelings at all.
---
Difficult to read with such a huge ego right ? ;p
---
Every time I get out of the shower I get to wrap a towel around my waist and call it a buttcape. The reactions are usually better than when I try it as a normal cape.
---
Please no... At first we would get neat classic RPG capes and then Anet will start to add some branded crystal shining 3 meter long carpets flying behind the characters...
---
So coordinating with others to work towards a common goal is now less social than afk-ing in lion's arch? And it's cheating to buy runs but it's not cheating by doing significantly easier content? 
---
I don't have legendary armor because of the exact same reasons that you champion, the difference being I understand why the most casual form of content shouldn't award one of the best rewards in the game. SURELY you can see the reasoning behind this? One would think since you've been playing mmo's and shit since the 90s you'd come to understand how shit works and how detrimental a system like this would be to the game. Especially a game like this where QoL, prestige and looks are the main status symbols and end-game drivers.
---
As someone who skins their legendary i do not care, but as a customer i'll support your topic.
---
Customer should be never concerned with how bad your day is, how much work you have, how bad is your manager, how understaffed are you - all that is internals that should not be brought up.
---
Honestly amount of times I ate "free pizza" next time because management of establishment have under-qualified and under-trained personnel is in dozens. It is not the rocket science and you have several simple things that you should do with any challange that arise in customer relations: Listen, Hear, Apologize, Offer solutions, Make them real. It is could be the same shit that you would do anyway, you need just simple acknowledgment, you know simple humble things.
---
I am genuine person, and I do like to thank people who are masters of their craft or on their way there, both morally and financially. But when you are greeted with excuse "we are busy" and "thats why you would eat meal that you not ordered and allergic to and we would do not do a shit about that" is the time when you fuck them over.
---
the best and easiest solution is just an increase to bounty rewards during the wait for the doppelganger. this would make bounties interesting again and give players who do the whole meta a meaningful reward
---
Don't think we need it but Guild Wars had one of the best capes in video games of it's time.
---
shuu, i got down-voted for this once.
---
What YOU (a very VERY small minority) enjoys is less important than the end-game rewards and gameplay that comes out of getting the best and prestigious armor in the game as well as the enjoyment of the majority.   
---
A WoW equivalent to this would be "why can't I have mythic levels of gear by grinding LFR?".   
---
We might aswell then award PvP titles and looks for doing open world too! I mean, PvP is not content everybody enjoys so why not?   
---
The same reason why OWPvE rewards aren't awarded in PvE and PvP is exactly the same as why it's not the other way around either.
---
He is probaly new to the game and doesn't know how Anet handles old content.
---
[NO CAPES!](https://i.imgur.com/9Ybgz.gif)
---
yeah.. but its something to do whike waiting.... you'll either wait now..or you'll wait because its takes awhile to gather currency.
---
Then do it.
---
Oh nice... I'll have to pay closer attention to when the streams are.
---
But it's always been equal to the open world PvE content. The issue is, they chose to attach Legendary armor to the raids.
---
Nope.
---
Yay! But can we have some indication of when these events are likely to run or actual time between events noted? as I've heard 40 minutes, 2 hours and 4 hours between them.
---
I've been after the risen high wizard for days for collection items and the only time i'v seen him out of 3 events, he didn't drop any. Yet the Eye drops his bit even when he doesn't spawn.
---
Setting an outfit covers your armor, whatever you use. Using outfits doesn't cost transmutation charges either.
---
You know what guild wars also needs? General Guild features. Guilds are so neglected in this game they should consider dropping it from the name.
---
Your question is a little unspecific here, because the term outfit refers to a specific system that has nothing to do with transmutation charges (your "tokens").
---
Once you have unlocked an outfit you can equip it at any time without any further cost. See the outfit panel in https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hero_panel .
---
Transmutation charges are consumed from the wardrope panel of the https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hero_panel . You change the appearance of one piece of equipment per charge, so if you replace that equipment piece your charge is "wasted". If you wanted to your new piece of equipment to have the same look you would have to use another charge to change it's look as well.
---
In that sense, it might be worth to wait with transmutation until you have equipment that is likely to stay. On the other hand, transmutation charges are not that rare, so it all depends on how often you change equipment, looks, etc.
---
I’ve experienced it as well but it just happens sometimes. Try walking around, the cub might be chilling somewhere else in your home
---
You can max get 40 in round 1, 38 in round 2 and 36 in round 3. So OP did his job!
---
Idk who told you that but they’re horribly wrong.
---
no
---
All of the champion weapons of which cobalt is one. Crystal guardian for example is also a nice greatsword. There is also a collection that requires collecting all of them.
---
You've been told wrong. It's very much alive, what with a new map, story episode, and mount, plus this week's meta event...event, and next week's launch of a new raid.
---
It’s been stated directly by Anet devs that raids are considered the hardest content for pve and should therefore have the best rewards for pve (envoy armor).  This is a design decision and designation assigned by Anet themselves not just by raiders lol
---
That's really nice of you! Just wondering where you advertise this? Cause I only check raid lfg if I'm looking to actually raid :p maybe in open world or LA map chat would be nice spots to advertise :) and again, this is awesome!
---
what do you mean? Like an in-game social media engine? We can call it FaceRoll. Like when you see a random player and right click on him you can see his guild profile page and see their recruitment message? Complete with calendars to organize public and private guild events? Saved messages so you don't need discord or FB groups? Built in guild VOIP feature?
---
watch as charr tails clip through the capes
---
We have scarfs......
---
No, just basic hdmi. I occasionally use it to play games with friends and this was the first time I encountered this issue.
---
Awesome! Glad to hear it. :)
---
That’s not true it’s not always been equal; in fact it’s almost always been superior. The rewards for group content have always been higher when played at a high level when compared to open world. So if you want the highest level of rewards you’ve always been forced to do group content
---
Each gamemode has their unique rewards, that's the carrot for people who play those gamemodes aim towards, and for people from other gamemodes to be interested in maybe switching up their playstyle a bit. If you could get every reward in every gamemode everyone would still flock to the easier way and all the other ones would be useless, so the same way the accessories make people from other gamemodes come to open world, and maybe find a lost love for the content. If you want the legendary armor skins for raids you need to experience the content, maybe you hate it and leave after you have your armor, but maybe you enjoy it and end up being more invested in game as a result. Being entitled to every reward on your preferred gamemode is the most backwards idea any mmo could have, it doesn't promote a good community, just separate gw2 into 3 different games if you wanna do it that way.
---
it should be fixed around the same time Half Life 3 gets released.
---
Try it? The game is free, and no one can tell if you're going to like it or not.
---
This is a mistake on their part, and one I hope they correct eventually. It took them three years to add raids in the first place, so fixing them could still happen.
---
The Crystal Desert used to be a dense forest and then one guy decided he *just had to craft l
---
ppppppffffff, you should have seen this fractal in the release week, when "we bleed fire" did more damage, with slippery slope and outflanked...that was a real cancer :D
---
Other combination like birds or something like that was a cancer too
---
Yes. Can be a bit hard to find direction early game but the community is incredibly welcoming and helpful. Try to find a nice guild and you’ll do totally fine
---
I mean is this game is p2w or something?
---
They will start roughly four hours after the last attack/defence. But at the moment there are to many maps opening and closing to predict something. Malchors leap is working quite well with all these woodfarmers but at prime time you will also have more than two or three maps.
---
Oh thank you, kind one, how generous and not condescending of you. Clearly, when ArenaNet don't work on something for 2 years and never acknowledge it, that doesn't in any way mean they have abandoned it. I see it clearly now, thank you!
---
Ah I see, my mistake, I thought legendary armor was supposed to sit on your inventory
---
Someday we’ll go to cantha just for the sake of you and other GW1 vets getting a mini togo. Don’t give up hope
---
Thanks dude
---
No but you will have to buy it. if you expect full f2p then no.
---
Nope not p2w in the slightest
---
Buying game isn't a big problem, i Hope here isn't monthly abonament like in wow
---
For the most part it's just been a slight quantity difference, if anything. You *might* be able to get a little more gold per hour by running dungeons than by running open world stuff, but you can still get plenty of anything, other than LIs, by just running open world stuff. 
---
Dungeons are more of a hassle, you have to be in LFG longer trying to get one organized, so I think it's fair that the *amount* of reward is slightly higher per hour of gameplay than in other content, but I don't think that inconvenience justifies them having exclusive access to entire types of rewards.
---
Yes, it does. My playtime dropped from logging in every day and playing whenever possible like the hugeass nerdy asocial nerd I am (except weekly movie nights/ beer at the pub with friends) to getting login reward and raiding 3hrs on monday, with the occasional rq inbetween cause I'm sick of playing the same things but nerfed. Maybe according to their metrics I'm still active, but let me tell you, it's one hell of a drastic change, and I'm not the only one.
---
It may come as a shocker, but bad decisions tend to pile up.
---
Idgaf about the look. I want the QoL.
---
speaking of Blish, is he ok? There was no mention of him in the last episode and everybody keeps pretending he's dead, but he's not. Shouldn't the commander go fetch him from Kralk's corpse's stomach? Presumably Blish's robotic body is intact because we kept getting readings from the sensor until the end, so all we have to do is flip the ON switch
---
No, it is really that 40/38/36 plus coins from killing troublemakers bonus events.
---
According to you it’s a mistake.  Important to point out it’s not an objective statement of fact
---
The game is alive more than ever! And that over the last years! Go ahead and start again, you will have fun with the mounts and new addons/maps/etc.
---
Sorry that people downvoted you tho...
---
What do you mean, this is an mmo, you are supposed to spend a large amount of time to get biggest reward in the entire gamemode. I guess this is the issue, some openworld players are used to getting exclusive skins for doing absolutely nothing, and when they do find a task that requires more than 2 hours of play time they begin shouting that "it's not fair". 
---
If you want shitty meaningless rewards, just join a training, you clearly don't value improving your skill in the game as a reward, so you will probably be content with some gold/achievements/possible title/ possible exclusive weapon skins after 2h of raid training. I can't believe how entitled you are.
---
&gt;It took close to an hour to do that Qadim with painfully forced portal and speed clear tactics that just weren't working
---
This really grinds my gears. I think people very easily forget that these speedclear/"tryhard" tactics do not make kills more reliable in 99% of the cases. They're only there for speed. Do them if you want to beat records or just work on getting faster clears with your group, but if not everyone is on board with them in the group or they consistently aren't working, just add some redundancies to your strategy.
---
I was once with a Qadim group as Chrono that had me take really low boon duration and portal/mimic/signet (back when that build was a thing), which led to awful uptimes on quickness/alacrity. They also did the "pull all magmas into Qadim and cleave them down in a few seconds" strategy and almost every single time, the pull failed or cleave wasn't good enough and a bunch of lava elementals went in. I think they also skipped stability pyre and had a spellbreaker try and remove stability for the CC phase, which sometimes failed too.
---
Similarly, I was with a Qadim CM group that also tried to do the above magma pulling tactic and they also took portals. The portals failed half of the time because people would port back onto a bouncing orb and get oneshot often. The magma pulling failed because magmas would get stuck in terrain or people wouldn't cleave enough. Etc etc. Eventually I insisted that we just run the safe strategies (pulling each magma individually, not using any portals), and we got the kill a few attempts later.
---
I feel like people just have too much pride to drop some of the elitist tactics and run the strategy that's best for the group. And then instead of blaming the fact that their strategies maximise risk for minimal gain, they blame others for not executing everything perfectly.
---
Starting the entire collection off with **three separate** scavenging quests lost me some hope in ANet for future content. They seem to think there is nothing wrong with having your players go to a spot, hit F, look at the wiki/guide for the next spot, hit F, repeat. I hate that a whole mount is locked behind this banal design.
---
So I finished that part and what's next? Do a bunch of stuff to teach your egg how to... embrace magic or whatever. **It all begins by going to a place and hitting F on an NPC.** At least there was a bit of story, but ultimately I found it all trite and the only reason I'm continuing to get the mount at this time is because I looked ahead to see there is no more of this.
---
I do not like the skyscale collection so far and it has hurt my opinion of Guild Wars 2, coming off a pretty decent LS.
---
You seemed to deem some content in the game unsignificant, thus unworthy of complaints for not being able to obtain it.
---
I had a lot of trouble finding meta events today while streaming. Admittedly I was unaware of the wiki link that tracks just the metas. When I actually got into meta events they seemed to be just finishing or bugged due to other instances of the map being full. I wonder if the team could consider a more robust in-game announcement system (similar to a recent bonus event that dealt with world bosses) and/or quest helper system that would take out the guesswork.
---
No, there are only at most 40 coins. You need more than 1 person to complete the meta.
---
&gt;Processing gif ydkyg47nti231...
---
?
---
They way they phrase it, it isn’t raid exclusive rewards but open world event rewards tied to the raid release that will be ongoing attainable through raids if you miss the open world event.
---
Or so, that’s how I understood it.
---
Let’s be honest though, skins from raids aren’t in any way prestigious.
---
is the bonus loot repeatable?
---
Elaborate, because there is a lot I could think of what you "can't get over"
---
We're only talking about subjective things here.
---
Raids doesn't need it that high, even keeping it at 85% for both is overkill in raids in terms of what is needed. More doesn't hurt but no need to overcap in fractals just for more in raids. You'd be fine at anything over 65% after food/utility in raids. Also the pack runes are important for getting boons going at the start, and keeping them up especially if running a single druid or not having good fury sources in fractals.
---
Actually that is not really true. If there is subscription, devs do get the money regardless of what they do, as many people have payments of that automated. Without subscription, devs have to actually give it an effort all the times and provide continuous content that actually people do like, otherwise they won't get any money.
---
Yes, it would probably change the composition of content (cash shop vs the rest of game), but it incentivises laziness. This mostly happened to WoW, where Activision calculated with people's addiction to the game and that they will pay subscription anyways (and it was like that *for years*), while they can just cut out expenses for development. And here we are, people finally realized and are running away from WoW en masse, because it turned out to be total low effort cashgrab.
---
You would have to be the supremum of laziness to go that way... :)))
---
This or you buy the Catmander Tag and give the Squadlead to someone without the Catmander Tag. Then you also have an invisible Commander Tag
---
because he had to delete blish.exe to fix the tracker.
---
There's currently two capes in game. They both have pretty bad clipping issues, and I end up just hiding them anyways honestly.
---
Don't buy a prebuilt, wait for AMD's new CPUs launching on the 7th of July, then /r/buildapc can help you pick out the parts.
---
Open lfg. Go to for example wvw squad (no one uses that). Post a listing here, that will create a comm less squad. Take the listing down.
---
From gw2 wiki :”There are 40/38/36 coins per player; therefore a minimum of 4 players are required to reach the second round, a minimum of 6 players are required to reach the third round, and a minimum of 7 players are required to complete the event.”
---
Ehh I have no experience with building and I’d rather not be my own tech support for that reason, but I can consider
---
No. 
---
It was definitely NOT enjoyable. 
---
It was grindy, repetitive and stuffed with frustrating time gates which if we didn't all cry hard enough for damn good reasons, they would still be unchanged.
---
Ooooh boy, my dear, dear friend. If you call this good, your mind is going to be blown in so many ways with what comes after.
---
Ask friends maybe, someone might help you :)
---
try it with out flanked
---
Building is really easy, and with how "great" most system integrators' support is, you _will_ end up being "your own tech support" anyway.
---
If they have the blue print they might as well use it.
---
Better than nothing eh?
---
I've been building for about 20 years. It has never been easier to build a computer than now.its like building a Lego set, then installing windows is just as easy
---
Horrible
---
That's good to know!
---
Or i hope its just someone who's not used to reddit who might not know.
---
&gt; and I am pretty sure he noticed this (people asking for the event to fail).
---
Orr temple events have been the exact same issue for *years*, for multiple collections and events. To *not* predict that that would be an issue this time required not knowing the game, like, at all.
---
Delete? The way I understood he merely had to disable his personality to have enough power to keep the tracker powered indefenitely. His higher functions would have used to much power for that.
---
And we had seen in earlier episodes that Blish can be reactivated from such a state and be “fine“ ( with some therapy due to having soend some time in oblivion).
---
Birds + we bleed fire was a hard nope
---
1. Wear what you find, salvage everything you can and deposit the materials into your storage (small cog in the upper corner of your inventory). There's equipment you cannot salvage or sell, you have to destroy. The materials you gain as a low level character are sometimes worth more than higher level materials, so I'd save them if you want to craft later. Everything you get rid of with the "Sell junk" button at the vendor has no other use than selling.
---
2. Ranger, specifically Druid, is solid as a healer in Raids and Fractals. In WvW it can be used as a roaming class (solo vs. other solo players), but you might have problems joining groups, as some commanders do not like Rangers in their squad since they don't really provide useful abilities. But this depends on the commander. Most classes have different uses and builds for each gamemode, so it's hard to recommend one for all.
---
3. Necromancer with minions is solid in PvE. It has different builds in the previous mentioned gamemodes. Generally, playing open world PvE, not instanced content, is possible with every class and whatever build, skills and weapons you prefer.
---
4. Builds in GW2 need Hero Points. Upon finishing level 80 you will have your base skills fully unlocked. For the specialisations you need 250 hero points each, which can be collected fast in the expansions. You can freely (without cost) switch your builds when unlocked to whatever you need.
---
Your statement isn't really true either, what happened with ActiBlizz has got to do with the fact that it's WoW, GW2 wouldn't have the luxury of such fan loyalties, at least not in the numbers required for this. WoW may be shit now but it was king MMO for a lot of years while having the sub from the beginning. There not being a sub doesn't compel the devs to make the effort but instead to go for the most surefire way to get the money which is cash-shop cosmetics currently. If there was a sub and a steady stream of income it would give them more freedom and less pressure to churn out costume after costume, skin after skin and possibly make some skins that we can get in-game instead of cash-shop only. 
---
The fact that there's 0 mount skins to get without cash shop is a direct product of that. 
---
However you turn it gw2 lost it's chance for sub based and it can only continue with the model we have now, but once upon a time things could have been different. Sub brings in more money (if a game makes good money they put a bigger portion back in it so it makes even more) unless it's cashgrab cash shop which we don't have, so money isn't as great as cash shops can bring. 
---
Who knows, if we were sub based for the last few years maybe the LWS episodes could always been available to all, more skins and cosmetics via in-game rewards and more development for multiple areas of the game, not just one at time. 
---
As for WoW people are leaving for entirely different reasons, especially now since you can just play with gold instead of irl money. WoW is shit because they were banking on other projects and pulled devs en masse from the game resulting in a sub-par xpac (keep in mind only now people are leaving heavily, Legion was still very successful). Which is not much unlike GW2, since release less and less developers are working on the game, not more. 
---
All in all there's always a danger that an MMO goes south because of bad management, but the fact still remains that on average sub based MMOs are doing much better (the current ones still being on top) and have more manpower to develop quality content (for reference WoW still had more players, profit and content that GW2 by a landslide over the same period of time). I truly believe if GW2 had more money for development and the manpower required it could be the best MMO on the market with no competition, but sadly only some parts of the game are being advanced, while others forgotten or simply can't be enhanced due to money/time/people.
---
The reward for that community goal was recipe unlocks available for the community. The actual event's reward was like 5k karma. Not a big deal.
---
Your reward is based on your participation at each tier. As long as you participate in the tier 4 through 5 you shouldn't have an issue as the other rewards for the community bonuses are not significant enough to matter
---
I complained about it initially but just got used to it and waiting wasn't too bad after a while I guess.
---
Did fractals just bring us a piece of the 1970s?
---
I was never really into capes in the original GW and would pretty much always disable them but if they can make them anything like syandanas from Warframe (with as much choice) then count me in.
---
It was gone for at least several days after multiple intentional checks. Reappeared immediately after going through the steps to unlock again.
---
Where you'll be slain by Granddad! ^(by Granddad!)
---
Hoe =/= Ho
---
Because people are smart?
---
You don't have to use minions in power reaper but the main reason minions are used is because you lose your utility half the time when you enter shroud as part of your damage.
---
Whenever i'm asked about inexpensive computer, i always reply with High End 2nd Hand Parts statement.
---
1. Basically no. Salvage items you aren't using or don't need, deposit the materials you get. Can check [this section on salvaging](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Salvaging) (though it mainly only starts to matter later).
---
2. Every single profession has meta options for power DPS, condi DPS, and healing (except warrior healing) as well as a bunch of other niche builds and boon supports. I wouldn't worry about it too much you can check [meta builds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Builds) for game modes if you want. In general for PvE though every group wants a warrior of some kind to bring banners, a healer of some kind to keep people topped off (though good fractal groups forgo this for more DPS), some way of providing group quickness and alacrity (usually chrono or renegade + firebrand) and might (usually druid in raids and [might stacking](https://discretize.eu/guides/blast-stacking) or many other options in fractals, and of course DPS (though you'll want power in fractals). So to sum up: play what you want but meta is usually support, healer, DPS or a hybrid of two. Common professions would be warrior (DPS/support with banners), druid (heal/support with might and spirits), chrono or firebrand/renegade (DPS/support with alacrity + quickness).
---
3. Necro with minions is very strong in open world, you can swap to reaper with Heart of Thorns and there are some meta power builds with greatsword reaper (melee). In general I will say there aren't many PvE builds that stay ranged since you need to be close to your group and you deal more damage for being closer to the boss (melee weapons hit for more, close AoE skills, multi hit skills, hitting multiple projectiles, etc). Druids have pets + spirits and some range on axe, though soulbeast (the better DPS spec) likes to stay merged together with their pet. It's kind of different renegade does summon in ghostly allies to deal damage and buff allies.
---
4. You need the expansions to unlock and select the elite specializations but yes, you can change builds at any time out of combat. By the time you hit level 80 you will have unlocked every skill and trait just from level up rewards so no worry on "wasting" points or anything. Druid for example is from Heart of Thorns while soulbeast is from Path of Fire.
---
/hood
---
Take my upvote you classy bastard.
---
One for every core and PoF map.
---
The reward for the community goal was the recipe unlocks which happened. the event itself gave 5k karma as reward
---
How hard is it to add a tag visible to squad members only, anet? If hard at least make a new color, a transparent one, you may leave the map icon on.
---
Yessir, berserker or marauder gear if you want more health and lifeforce, you can play around with runes a bit, but I shoot for Power and Ferocity. Vitality is an alright choice too since it increases your lifeforce gain slightly.
---
I did you the favor of bolding the parts of your posts that were causing you to get downvoted, and explained that it's because you sounded like an insufferable know-it-all. Whether or not you meant to claim you were ultra intelligent (and I don't believe for a second that you didn't), that's how you sounded. 
---
Your lack of self-reflection on this is disappointing, but unsurprising.
---
You haven’t understood anything I said.
---
Have you checked a #raids channel on your guilds discord? It has well put step by step plan for You and people like you.
---
It's really not that bad. 
---
Dragonfall currency falls from the sky doing the meta, it's a non-issue, you'll actually have fun doing this one.
---
Kourna: do the meta when it pops, that gets you quite a few, run some gathering circles, and do some easy hearts. 
---
Jahai: Shatterer and rifts get you a lot, you can do up to 5 rifts per day for rewards, and the heart in the bottom left can basically be afk-ed so just do that while watching something.
---
Sandswept: one of the more drudgery filled ones, the metas don't give that many and map completion is a bad currency/time investment, and the hearts take a while too. At least the gathering nodes are plentiful. Space this one out with others.
---
Istan: meta, meteors, and gathering nodes are plentiful. The hearts give you 25 each instead of 5. This is seriously easy to finish. 
---
Thunderhead Peaks: metas are nice but very spaced out in time, so it's not reliable for gathering large numbers of shards. I honestly ran the heart at the forge on multiple characters for days, at least the heart was very fast. Gathering is good on this map too. Probably my second least favorite after sandswept.
---
The statement was made 1 year and a half before restructuring and layoffs. The layoffs did not affect it in any ways.
---
Yh really lame excuse. Why are they more concerned with players who don't want to buy the expansions than everybody else who did?  
---
It's not like other guild missions would get removed or anything. How is the context of making happy loyal players vs. f2p players, the f2p groups experience is more important?
---
Well, yea, but the vector of progression is pretty big deal for this as well. By that I mean that over at least a year we actually are getting whole sets of skins as gameplay rewards on regular basis, and actually WoW getting into the cash shop waters more and more. Hopefully we will see this even in mount skins, but so far we are rather getting full featured mounts instead...
---
What home instance are you using? Just tested using it on all 3 tools on the asura one and got nothing. Full disclosure, though - I only gather LS nodes in my daily run.
---
Raid release is at a 9 month pace so no, they did not become more regular during s4.
---
This was definitely the idea, unfortunately the rift achievement is broken...
---
Also simply getting to the rifts involved practicing with the skyscale a little which is nice. It's probably the most complicated mount, possibly besides the griffon.
---
You know what the issue with capes in GW2 is? All those huge, flashy, animated Backpieces we alaready have. Also, Shields, GreatSwords, Staves, Bows... All the weapons that are strapped to your back when not being wielded. Something that didn't happen in GW1 - they were always wielded on your hands/arms.
---
I usually mine the human one (even though my character is asuran too). With a fully decked out instance, I hit twice near the entrance to the home instance, then head to difluorite (which is separate), metals, plants, gardens, drop down for bloodstone, winterberry, gift, pearls, head to center where I speed up again with trees, plants, and the basic cloth/leather, kourna chest, advanced cloth/leath, jade shards, backtrack to the little alley where I drop down to mine brandstone and finish with the new mistborn node.
---
Maybe makes them finally get PoF or HoT then…. This must be the only MMO on the planet where people don't get all of the content and are actively protected from doing so.   
---
I would understand if it was some p2w dogshit but it's an expansion which gives you MANY things and are well worth it.   
---
Not even going into what an incredible minority those people are...
---
Very resistable headgear imo
---
I think i may have a problem i always read Ahdashism as ADHAism :P
---
New to PoF here, and one of the things iv'e noticed was the coins spawning in places that i had passed before with my poor ,cant jump high enough nor fly blue tinted and sassy as hell , raptor , and afaik ,on a single round.Im talking about the coins on the ground. might be mistaken )\_) , as i've said , late to the PoF train here so everything seems shiny \^\^
---
You should for a legendary you like, not the one which seems to be the easiest. There is no "mistake" in picking one you like. 
---
But generally gen2 legendaries are more expensive but could be bought straight out since 95% of it is just a material dump, with the only exception being C&amp;C, Astralaria, Hope and Nevermore with their collections.

The gap between Wing 1 and Wing 2 is 112 days.
---
The gap between Wing 2 and Wing 3 is 98 days.
---
The gap between Wing 3 and Wing 4 is 239 days.
---
The gap between Wing 4 and Wing 5 is 293 days.
---
The gap between Wing 5 and Wing 6 is 294 days.
---
The gap between Wing 6 and Wing 7 (so far) is 259 days.
---
Yup, regular. /s
---
No, gw2 is a cpu heavy game, these CPUs are not on par with recent ones
---
Chuka and Champawat are one of the best journeys; time, effort, resources are almost the same, but the story behind it is one of the best side stories.
---

---
i'm in love. but am i in love more than my love for the celestial rooster skin? hmm.
---
Gotcha! So, I should be looking for a higher cpu rather than gpu?
---
You're right. What I meant is in term of Episode. Season 3 was short, about a year while S4 lasted 18 months. The release of new raid cadence is more aligned on episode release now than it was before. But episode release in S4 was slower... So all in all the numbers of days to wait remains the same but we know when to expect things rather than feeling neglected by the absence of status updates
---
There aren't any golem minis that are wearing a lab coat. Which is pretty adorable and unique.
---
Why that s in the end?
---
NGL, a few of those ideas are pretty cash money. Public Guild pages with records of their raid/pvp/whatever could really amp up the prestige factor of some guilds. it would also be fun to unlock different trackers that could be put on your page as a guild.
---
but...
---
I just want to play Basket Brawl.
---
Come on. Just drop!
---
The number of times I feel like someone has said this lol.. I think there's maybe like 2 outfits with caps buuut anet has pretty much [made it clear..](http://gph.is/XIBFQh)
---
Regular releases? Wing 6 released September 18... that means aobut 260 days gap between releases.
---
They sadly had not enough time to make same journeys for later legendaries of gen2 (while maintaining the releases of them as community demanded), so those don't have such sized collections anymore. However the costs should be quite on similar level across the board.
---
Ectogambling is the best minigame :^)
---
Thunderhead Peaks meta is on a regular timer though, and also gives you plate halves. My least favorite, like you, is the difluorite, and that could be fixed by having the nodes drop a guaranteed 1-3. It'd still be a grind, but a few days ago I hit like 5 nodes in a row that didn't drop crystals. I'm one of the few that don't mind the grindy nature of the skyscale stuff but that was enough to even frustrate me to the point that I took a break to play Civ for a few days instead.
---
Also, in Kourna, can we get a *bit* more progress per tasteless root? Iboga are annoying to deal with, and it's just tedious when you make like 5 laps around the base dealing with their shit, and when you drop it off the bar barely moves.
---
All legendaries are expensive. I think the new ones, which are easier to craft, cost more than the older ones.  They're just easier, because you don't have to do the scavenger hunt bit.
---
I rather have them figure out how to make existing ones interesting rather than add a few bunch more that you then only play a couple of times and then never again.
---
My reasoning behind this is simple. If you release something that is boring many players will try it and then not look at it again even after you changed it. The same principle pretty much applies to Dungeons as well. They are profitable and not dead yet most think they are.
---
Which means, if you release a bunch that are just like the others, clunky, not rewarding and prone to issues like syncing or latency issues as in Crab toss or keg brawl then they will end up in the same place the others are right now.
---
Last Festival of the four winds I tried to do Sanctum spring again and it still had the same issues of not registering my skill actions in the same way it was since the fist time I played it in season 1.
---
So my reservation to this is that adding new things will not fix the problems that are with the rest.
---
You got elite specs in 6 hours?
---
Looking to tag as many mobs as possible during metas such as Istan and Thunderhead Keep North.
---
It's almost laughable because these used to be somewhat challenging.
---
happens... but why the downvotes? am I missing something here?
---
hand-some, teehee
---
Alright. It's all about compromise!
---
More regular =|= more frequent
---
Anyone checked the days between releases?
---
No not tedious at all. 
---
1: Its getting me back into old zones.
---
2: Its not important for any content. We have plenty of other mounts and there is no unique reward or meta that only can be reached by the skyscale.
---
3: The quicker I finish the skyscale the sooner I run out of season 4 content till next episode which presumably is 3-4 months away. After that its back to grinding for gold and achievements. I don't get the rush for people to be done ASAP.
---
only 20.000 gems per month
---
This sort of thing is exactly why Anet started their policy of silence on BTS plans.
---
Wait a second. How do you tally "expect to optimise" with "playing the character screen is a choice you make" exactly? Conflating "high end raiding" with "clear any boss with any dps" doesn't help to get your point across either. 
---
In the scenario you've outlined, you can roll up with an optimised character and still end up playing the character select screen because other options are *that much better*. Then, it isn't a choice to play the character select screen because that is how people expect you to optimise. It isn't by having full infusions on your condition soulbeast or necromancer but rather having access to a mirage. 
---
At one point, if the difference between optimal and "viable" is too large, optimal becomes far, far closer to necessary and for many groups tackling encounters like Largos Twins, that extra DPS is absolutely necessary to avoid a night of miserable wipes. 
---
This really shouldn't be an issue in a game like Guild Wars 2 where the devs don't need to balance around multiple difficulties or gear break points or secondary systems. If the balance was reasonable and simply optimising the different elites of one character was sufficient, I'd agree with your statement. Sadly it isn't and your "optimising" is by having multiple different characters.
---
This is a healthy mindset for the skyscale. After skyscale then what are people going to do till next episode in 3-4 months? Go back to grinding metas? Those aren't going anywhere.
---
Caperomise
---
As I'm playing both games, WoW hasn't gotten into cash shop waters any more than it has always been, I can't see anything different from looking at it so you'd have to explain what did they do specifically?  
---
As for us, the skins we do get aren't really on par with the cash shop ones, let's be honest here (a lot of them made with higher quality and care than the damn legendary sets). As for mounts I don't think it's a toss-up between we either get skin vs. full mount. If we can get both mounts and skins in the shop, then we can get both mounts and skins period. Wouldn't kill them to put some basic ones in-game now would it?   
---
I like this game as much as you do, but let's keep our facts straight and not just accept everything blindly just because we want to be better than those other guys.   
---
It took us 6 years to get to this point, and even tho I am glad we finally got here, it still took us 6 years. That's our vector of progression, quite slow for something so simple that is in-game rewards and incentive.
---
Your situation doesn't have much to do with KP tho. 100kp team is obviously more experienced and overall better than 1kp, but they failed in judgement (granted, they probably didn't care nearly as much about *just* killing quadim for 50th time without any flair). Just like 1kp group could fail. 
---
 And while general experience is objective, there are usually no universal "better" tactics that can be taken without appraising and considering group's quality. Also since it's a pug group and you were a part of it, you could and should have spoken up your concerns too.
---
Devs comfirmed that they said it together during the cutscene.
---
Commandergram.
---
I agree with /u/Skooxs , neither of these are acceptable.
---
I see. Okay! Guess time to save some $$ for the season 2. It’ll be later on tho. So I guess I’ll just grind stuff and do mastery stuff on Tyria before moving on.
---
Its ok, someone just cleared out the harpies for the picture, they'll be back soon.
---
Polymock!
---
If you use more skills than autoattacks and you still struggle, then I honestly feel sorry for you.
---
And you get from lvl 1 - 80 by clicking on the item "level 80 boost" which comes with the "expansions", if you can call 5maps an expansion.
---
That ship has long since sailed.
---
you can get volatile gathering tools without buying the gem store ones too.
---
Have you ever played Journey on the playstation 3 or 4? There your character get a scarf of increasing length. It's awesome! It also glows!
---
But 5 to 6 was 304 days and 4 to 5 was 293 days. So numbers say we had to wait one month less for w7 than we waited for wings 5 and 6. Regular does sadly not imply often...
---
You say this like it's a problem
---
Some armor skins from the karma vendors in Orr look pretty good!
---
\#speakforyourself  
---
😏
---
Pet battles with minis! With a ton of achievements and collectibles! Fishing, player housing,....
---
it depends on which legendaries you are talking about. 
---
1st batch (the ones purchaseable on TP). Their cost vary quite a lot depending on which one you go for. Popularity usually makes it more expensive due to the price of the precursor. As a matter of time to craft it all depends on the gold you need to farm. Every other account bound currency is the same for all of them.
---
2nd batch (the first 4, collection based). They more or less cost the same gold wise speaking. Time/effort depends on the collections. If a collection needs to beat a legendary boss and nobody ussually does it you will have to organize the event yourself to gather people. This was easy on release because everybody was doing them. Not sure about now.
---
2nd batch (remaining). It's all gold based so it's all a matter of how much time you need to get the gold (account bound currency is thte same for all of them). In terms of gold the 2 handed weapons are more expensive, followed by the 1 handed ones and finally by the off-hands. But there's a trick applicable for the 2 handed ones which can save you about 200 gold.
---
the currency grind is a huge turn off and the main reason why its taking so long. this step absolutely reeks of the kind of mindless grinding they said they wanted to avoid years ago. the rest of the collection is very well done. the mats gathering section is worse and takes longer than the entirety of the griffon
---
Since I got my dungeoneering one, I've swore never to grind for any cape again.
---
He's also the guy that only ever uses Life Sheath in an area where there's lots of Degen hexes...
---
DAoC reference. That game had capes done right indeed.
---
I know it's a little late to tell you, but it's always a good idea to save some of your map resources for things like this. LS3 gave us Aurora so it was predictable that LS4 was going to give something similar, aka, Vision. It's true that this time however the skyscale required some materials too.
---
If you don't like to grind then you now know what to do for LS5 ^^
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah it's always been one of those things where it's like, "Okay I know I'm not getting it somehow, but in the time it takes to leave the game, go to the wiki, find the right page, read it, and understand it...i could have the roots I need. Maybe."
---
For the spies I was just always looking for an NPC called "Awakened Spy", or talking to pact members to look for conversation options to expose spies. I totally thought that one NPC who is always like, "Ugh, I can't believe they sent me *you*." was a spy.
---
Gotta say though, the only thing in that map more annoying than the iboga is every lap around hearing, "HAIL MIGHTY HERO!"
---
I had a roleplay guild who's goal was to get here. I thought it'd be a good idea if they added it as a raid later, even though I don't raid on gw2 personally. Props to them :] 
---
I'm not a huge fan of gw2's latest content or time gates so while I haven't played much since the release of PoF I still keep tabs to see if the game is worth returning to.
---
I never said raids are what this game was about or implied it.  I've accepted that they weren't a long time ago.
---
[Here's](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_Collection_Related_Rewards) the wiki page with a list of all rewards/gizmos so far. :)
---
obviously useless speculation.
---
it's definitely not 10 months wait per content drop that destroyed the community.  Nope that's definitely not it.
---
I've been had. Well played.
---
They're like hydras. Not too bad on their own if you keep on your toes but things get really hairy when a patrol of them sneak up on you. Back when PoF launched a friend expressed his disappointment in the hydras because they look so menacing but they get put down pretty easily. A while later we're in Crystal Oasis and start up the djinn hero point. While he's distracted the patrolling veteran hydra sneaks up on him and proceeds to barrel into him and drop meteors on him. He had a healthy respect for them after receiving the classic Guild Wars hydra experience. I'm hoping there are ruby djinn in the raid and they're as sneaky and dangerous as the ones in the original were. They were good quality.
---
For most people the biggest barrier for any legendary is the raw cost,  but assuming the gold is there then it really just comes down to completion time.
---
**Gen 1 Legendaries:**
---
The only significant time sink here is world completion. With GW2TaCo / AugTyr this has become a pretty easy and mindless process that can be hammered out in a few days or paced out pretty comfortably over a couple weeks. Beyond this the only other time sink would be collecting the requisite dungeon currency, but that's pretty insignificant by comparison. 
---
**Gen 2.0 Legendaries:**
---
These are the first 4 HoT legendaries which were all collection based - Nevermore, Astralaria, H.O.P.E., Chuka and Champawat. On top of the gold cost, these require players to complete lengthy and often time gated collections. Some are better than others and it really comes down to what sort of gameplay you like. These are by far the most difficult and lengthy legendaries to complete solely based on the requirements. 
---
**Gen 2.5 Legendaries:**
---
These are the rest of the HoT legendaries, Exordium being the most recent and final one. All you need for these is HoT or PoF completion gifts. If you're starting out fresh with no experience with HoT or PoF these gifts can take a while as you need to first max out all the core masteries for each expansion. If you already have this done, then the completion gifts are very easy to get and take little time compared to gen 1 world completion. By far the quickest and easiest legendaries to craft.
---
If expecting content in a span of less than 10 months is entitlement from a game this big then you're basically saying we should let anet continue to get away with working on other failed projects.
---
flax farm with volatile sickles also
---
Engineer 10/10
---
No, I have a password manager so I'm not to worried. Was just checking to see where it originated from, because pwned will not say
---
Of course it's efficient ... But so boring that I rarely practice this kind of farm. Maybe two characters do the same thing in a row... but not more. I just can't. (-:
---
Anyone know if participating in T1 will get you rewards for future tiers? I will have limited playtime from the weekend on to the end of the event.
---
Perfect! Ty
---
100% recommend Karmic Retribution, it makes a huge difference.
---
Also second taking it slow.  Skyscale is fun, but purely optional.
---
Are you hunter s thompson?
---
I see "Irresistible", but read it as "Ear-resistible"... .... ... please don't shoot me.
---
Yeah I typed that message while I was logged in and playing. Apparently you need to go to certain maps to get it (I assume core maps).
---
I hate you for the memories ... I want to play GW1 now ... &lt;3
---
Thank you. You da man.
---
I have. I enojyed it.
---
Oh I definitely agree. I grinded for the skyscale this way, and that quickly reached my limit. Not the way I want to play this game, and I can't imagine doing 6x the amount that way :)
---
101% koda's warmth enrichment
---
It's telling me MyFitnessPal back in February of 2018, but I never even had an account there, so I'm not sure
---
Falling ecto cost are making me think more and more about that every day.  Still a big commitment but...
---
Thankfully I have a password manager and 2FA on everything for this reason haha
---
Unpopular opinion here: I'd like if legendary weapons were like this instead of being 80% spreadsheet craft bussywork. Any person with hoards of materials and gold can craft legendaries now, skipping most of the process, and the rest have an awfuly anti-immersive experience that consists mostly of grinding.
---
This collection showed that Anet can give you two options: you can either pay to make it happen way faster, or you can do it the slow way and save your gold.
---
Yes, I'd reather have a super lengthy but immersive time gated collection for legendaries than logging in daily to farm a crapton currencies and check wikis for crafting recipes on top of more crafting recpies which are also timegated.
---
Although I'm not a big fan of this collection and how it has you going pretty much everywhere just to press F, it has some very fun and quirky parts (like making you do Jumping Puzzles, if you want!). 
---
That said, I wouldn't have minded the daily timegate if the mount offered more than what it really does.
---
They can get hard with certain instabilities, and T4 means you have 3 instabilities, so higher chance to get those what are making it harder.
---
However there is not real list of what is harder and what is easier, as the impact of certain instabilities is different for each fractal. 
---
The point of instabilities is to change your playstyle for having max effectivity to clear the fractal, however huge majority of people just blindly follows one single meta and then are pikachuface.png when it does not work effectively in all cases. Small changes in their builds or composition would bring the harder fractals/instability combos on par again, but that it apparently too much work and too much thinking required.
---
I've been in many a "normal" group (from casual partial clears through to aiming for CMs quickly to quick clears early in the week) and that pressure definitely exists so I don't see us agreeing on that point any time soon. So I'll move on from that! 
---
Sadly it isn't limited to just Confusion being the issue, if it was we'd see other Confusion based options like Engineer excelling to the same level as Mirage. It doesn't, as Mirage has additional benefits that allow for a higher real-raid DPS due to contributions from other strong conditions and a plethora of evades and movement abilities that means the downtime experienced by other professions isn't so sorely felt.
---
Confusion absolutely needs addressed, but independently of that, so does the dominance of Mirage relative to other condition damage options.
---
I personally don't like power creep so wouldn't advocate in the direction of that given the wider impact it has on other game modes. However, the condition vs power imbalance can be addressed quite readily by encounter design aspects. We see that with increased power DPS damage on VG, condition vulnerability on Karde (if I tenner correctly) and there are plenty of bosses that are damage type agnostic to a reasonable extent (VG through the red boss mechanic, Gors, Sab, Xera, MO, Dhuum come to mind quickly). 
---
It comes down to encounter design and Anet moving away from the lazy condi boss vs power boss design that has become so predominant and instead having places for both damage types through different phases and design parameters. That has the additional advantage of minimising the dominance of one profession on a boss too.
---
And stack on green Aoe.  People run away and then get Jaws'd.

[If you listen closely you can actually hear her speaking with Caithe in the original.](https://youtu.be/w8eaSlXy1HU?t=50)
---
So subtle no one caught it until afterwards.
---
I'm in the same position. Between the time I started and ended the SkyScale collection my karma went up by 94,000. All I did was the steps associated with the collections.
---
Karma? How so? How much are we talking?
---
[This one ?](https://www.deviantart.com/nebezial/art/dumbest-guild-wars-2-joke-EVER-712445144)
---
OH! So that's how that works. It has been showing me Balthazaar temple and I'm like how does it know that's up, I don't want to do that, I want to see what's currently going/up next. So I've just been using the wiki meta-event rush event timer and finding out what's up that way.
---
&gt; Bad: That there is no alternative/semi-help to the 250 mats from each map for the saddle.
---
Players: Give us a reason to go to previous maps! ANet: Gives a reason to go to previous maps. Players: Surprised Pikachu face.

&gt; The materials gathering portion of this collection is the worst grind I have ever had to complete to access a main feature.
---
"Worst grind"? No, it's not.
---
"Main feature"? No, it's not.

&gt; Awful: Not being able to keep my karma high enough

---
Saddle cost was not so high for me, as I had quite a bunch stored from actually playing the older maps throughout last year more than a week on their releases. So I had to just do new map and few tokens in thunderhead. Not really a grind that way.
---
Karma - yea, go get that karma boosts for LS maps, those are pretty much worth it.
---
You have
---
A) mechanics that can on shot most
---
B) a lot of adds, some ranged with dmg
---
C) only a small plattfrom to fight
---
For me that is the very definition of a harder boss encounter, even without instabilities
---
Yes, T2. 5 days left but it includes weekend.
---
Do you recommend purchasing all seasons? I guess I have access to four and five since I logged in at those times, will check which ones I have access to in my in-game character journal (I believe that's what's it called).

I swear that in these threads are only anet accounts saying how cool every little shit put in the store is.

Wow sounds so cool!

It's painfully obvious you didn't play at all, maybe use your boost and go auto attacking in said expansions, post results for us to laugh at

Ok but the skritt cannot know
---
Chrono/druid is not currently the only way to bring all the buffs you need to a group. But it was actually that way for a long time, so a lot more people play those two than the new builds.
---
It also brings a lot of utility of its own, and easy access to a lot of active defenses and control tools which make it a very effective tank as well as a support.
---
Will definitely pay more attention to it next time im in Amnoon , and got PoF last week as well, after a 2 year hiatus , that i sorely regret -\_- .

I only wish that they had kept most of the collection INSIDE Dragonfall itself.

The stage where yu had to infuse the egg and shyt all over Tyria is not enjoyable for me.

We could use some more core activities. Specially in cities to make them a bit livelier. 
---
Some of these would have to be instanced, but I think most of them could be fun:
---
* Divinity's Reach
---
 * Bouncer Brawl: The originally intended activity was about using drinks to fight, but that doesn't go well with age rating boards. So let's make it about being bouncers instead. You enter, and you are made hostile to a bunch of drunkard in the bar. You have to use the skills given to keep them from breaking the bar, harming other customers, and kick them outside. 
---
 * Mina's Shooting range: A simpler version of the shooting game in Verdan Brink, using first person. Unlike verdant brink's target practice, you won't be able to move your character, only aim, and it will also have "no-shoot" targets that penalize you when you shoot them. First round would only show targets inside the tent, second would also show them around the tent, and third will also show them in the surrounding area, coming from behind houses and decorations.
---
* Hoelbrak:
---
 * Son's of Svanir Punch-Out Extravaganza: Starts in one of the entrances of Veins of the Dragon and make your way punching son's of svanir faces all the way to Dragon Hallow. There you'd punch down the door while fending off waves of attackers, and discover a hidden tunnel that takes you to more punching and a secret final boss. 
---
 * Keg Brawl Practice: Help young norn learn how to play Keg Brawl in this adventure, by grabbing and throwing kegs while a few kids try to take them from you. Remember that you can charge a throw that can go all the way to the Ale Collector straight from where the kegs fall, since you'd need that to get gold.
---
* Black Citadel: 
---
 * Nolani Target Practice: You get control over a cannon and fire at the ghosts coming from Nolani Academy Ruins.
---
 * Scrapper Watch: Charr from above will throw scrap at you. And you have to sort them by throwing them in the corrsponding bit for "Still working", "Fixable", "Salvageable" and throw to the lave furnace the rest. Seems simple, but a few gladius scrappers will appear to and try to steal the scrap. Throwing takes a bit of time, but you can grab several scraps before throwing them together to the same bin. Unfortunately, the more scraps you are holding, the slower you move. 
---
 * The Bane: The bane could be added if they ever add Meatoberfest. It could be the opposite of the Gauntlet: Instead giving you a fixed boss and you having to figure out a build to beat them, they give you a fixed build and you have to survive as many waves of enemies as possible with each build. Builds will include a series of player profession builds that you get as a transformation (i.e.: If you grab the warrior build, you get transformed as a warrior with a warrior build even if you are no warrior), but also other sorts of builds, mostly from story: 
---
      * A charr tank with [Dune Roller](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dune_Roller) skills.
---

* The Grove: 
---
 * Hide-and-Go-Sapling: Teach a bunch of young Saplings about the popular game played by children. They will hide across the grove and you'd have a time to find them. They won't have nameplates, and they won't always appear on the same spots, but it won't be completely random. You will get a few skills to track them, one of which will reveal their nameplates temporarily.
---
 * The Song Remains the Same: Basically Simon. A bunch of Saplings will be taking turns playing with instruments, and you will be given a temporary instrument to replicate what each of them play. The third round will be the hardest since they will play together, combining notes from different instruments.

* Rata Sum

 * Lab Helper: Similar to the chef in Amnoon oasis, but repeatable. The lab director will ask for lab materials, and you have to grab them and give them to him in time. But careful, unlike with the chef, you can't throw all of them. Some are fragile or explosive. Make sure to throw all the ones that can be thrown to waste less time walking and be fast enough for gold.

 * Polymock should be made its own thing. [For example, something like this](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/845928/#Comment_845928). A mix of polymock and trading card game that can also be played on mobile. You'd equip 3 minis and a deck of cards, choose the mini to start, and you can use the mini's skills, plus the skills you get from your deck, and take turns fighting each other.

I got it while in Tangled Depths
---
I simply dont see a reason to raid. 
---
If i want challange i fight in PvP modes and the only reward i care about would be the legendary ring. 
---
I still hope we get a WvW/PvP alternativ.
---
How is giving away raid rewards through open world going to entice people to raid?
---
Druid? You mean the trash tier support for fractals which has no access to stab, quickness, or alacrity, and offers a spirit which can be taken by soulbeast???
---
And has poor healing to boot?
---
If thats your build benchmark and you fail to surpass it...
---
I still have yet to see any of the new recipes in the world.
---
heres a reason: its fun
---
Ahah xD so true. I'm just saying druid can offer more offensive buff with spirit en spotter and some people think only in term of DPS, offensive support. 
---
So in that concern the aura build I'm sharing here doesn't  provide comparable unique offensive buff, that's all ;)
---
Pull agro, increase your defense, break bar ability, on top of necros f1 and vamp abilities.
---
The blue glow not being dyeable and the Winter's Presence being a shoulder skin and not an infusion are definitely around the top of my list of things I'd like to see changed. I doubt it is easily changed retroactively though, but one can dream.
---
Is this a new meta? I've done a couple, but I don't remember seeing it before.
---
I mean, likely his golem body got vaporized when Kralk went boom...unless Aurene somehow was able to absorb enough magic and buy enough time to nab his remains.  
---
Although, personally I would prefer Blish's body being recovered for burial rather than resurrection. It will allow us to start next season on another memorial like with S3 XD

Yes, there were posts about them last week.

Well sure, keep your bonus chests and let the maps rot is probably better that way.

I have a huge problem with the stylistic choice for Guild Wars 2. You'll see more of me.

If people like me don't actively complain, the game will turn into oversized weapons, flashy everything and so on and so forth.

Oh wait..

Hence why my comment and I are here.

Meanwhile Dragonfall lets you get a full set of Diviner exotic armor and two skin sets via a handful of meta clears.

Good.

So I just finished the first part of the skyscale collection thingy - after the eggs part gorrik send me a letter which said - ALL EPISODES OF SEASON 4 REQUIRED or some crap like that. My question is do I need to purchase them , I've only finished the last two and weren't online for the previous ones?
---
Cape glider when
---
Thanks for the explanation!
---
OP's title is a little bad. His PSA is saying that you do not have to worry about missing tiers. Just participate whenever, like with previous community goal events.
---
Thanks everyone for their explanations!
---
Mesmer/Mirage might be your best bet.
---
Mirage is probably what you are looking for. Dodge dodge teleport dodge.
---
Mirage.

It hasn't changed since launch.

I can already tell, that this looks better than what they will do to it.

Looking at these beautiful pictures, makes me wish that game would get a sequel.

I've enjoyed all of the collection up to the map currency grind..it's just too much.  And tying into a legendary doesnt make it acceptable. 
---
I don't think I'll enjoy the rift grind either. It's a shame. 
---
I do not mind the time gating at all. There's always other things to do, for me.

Hi and welcome to gw2!  I played as a solo raid healer in DDO for years, so I can understand a bit of what you want.  Some warnings, on mobile so format is gonna be shit.  Also my spelling is terrible and my advice is mostly my own experiences seasoned with my opinions. 
---
&gt;1. Side-question: What is the differences between fractals, dungeons, raids, tiers, Open World, (others) ? What is the group oriented end-game between these?
---
I'm going to try and briefly explain each of these separate from one another.  Rather than just a blunt differences.  The wiki will have more details obviously.  I hope to just give enough info to get a grasp on each area.
---
Fractals- unique story style maps that have different difficulty tiers.  The higher you go the more of a unique stat you need called Agony Resistance.  This is something you can earn from doing fractals or purchase from the trading post.  The item is an agony infusion which is slotted into an infusion slot from ascended gear.  There are also unique challenges that appear in the high tier fractals called instabilities.  The party size is capped at 5.
---
Unique fractal rewards - agony infusions, fractal relics and pristine fractal relics.
---
Rewards of note - ascended gear drops (rings, selectable amour boxes and selectable weapon boxes)
---
Dungeons - two faces to every dungeon.  The story and explorable.  You must complete the story to OPEN the explorable.  If someone else opens the explorable you may join them regardless if you completed story.   Explorable is at a higher difficulty than story.  The max party size is 5.
---
Unique dungeon rewards - each dungeon has it's own currency which can be traded in at a dungeon vendor for rewards related to itself.  There is a collection for each dungeon's weapon and armour (but WvW reward tracks are honestly better to clear the bulk of it).  
---
Raids - I dont know much about as I've only done one successfully.   High difficulty, high coordination areas with a party cap of 10, and requiring a commander tag iirc.  This is, in some options, the true endgame due to difficulty,  mastery of class and coordination required.
---
Tiers-  please elaborate  as there is a few different areas in which tiers come into play (WvW and fractals come to mind first).
---
Open World - this is a big topic, far too large for a quick overview.  But I'll try.  This is every zone in the game.  From starting to level 80 zones.  Many zones have meta events in them.  All HoT maps, Living season3, living season 4 have a unique currency for each zone.  LS3, LS4, and Path of fire have a shared currency contained within.  Unstable magic volatile magic and trade contracts respectively.
---
&gt;2. If I wanted a reactive, spammy bunker, that is effective in group play and pulls its weight, carries utilities that groups seeks, that would have a place in a composition (before I start investing time in an alt. for diversity). A character that has the potential to protect others while "controlling the battlefield" and be helpful, what would be your suggestion of class/build?
---
Guardian.   And there are so many possible builds to go with.  You can go dragon hunter trapper, flameseeker burner, vanilla shouts.  Gw2 metabattle will have a bunch of different builds and gear based upon content.  Check it out or read the wiki and pick what you want to fucons on and you around with it yourself.
---
I mean that is pretty dang slow.

Back when people were bitching about why she could suddenly speak on her own but needed Caithe to speak previously, I just never really thought of it. And then it hit me. The CONTEXT surrounding the moment she spoke. If she spoke on her own, nobody would believe her! So she needed a mouthpiece, an advocate...of sorts. Sort of like how if the stars aligned alongside all 8 planets, Pluto, and whatever the heck they discovered to take its place on a Tuesday afternoon at 4:44 PM, then someone would defend another person from a bully.

You can be mobile with deadeye riffle 4 will make you hum forward if done properly (3 times in a row) plush shadow step , or bow or dagger pistol

Whats wrong with shortbow? Does lovely dps on condy soulbeast, makes for a nice offhand on theif, and i definitely plan to use it on a renegade whenever i get around to leveling a revenant
---
Oh man!  I've gotta do this meta so it copies my name

Funny how you have no idea what you're talking about yet you felt the need to make a post about it. Maybe do some actual research next time. The wiki is great.

Saving this. This is genius.

Clearly legendaries cost alot more than i was expecting. I have around 260 gold in my bank right now with most of my crafting professions at level 400ish, should i put off legendaries for a while until i accumulate much more resources?

---
Worst case scenario he'll get a forced name change.  But I would still advise against using your IRL name for a character.
---
"If Mordremoth could attack &gt;!the mother tree in the grove!&lt;, he could attack anywhere!"
---
dont forget you need the 1 powdered rose quartz per kralk ore and you can either farm those or buy from the TP. Those were really cheap before the collection dropped but now not so much. At least if you are like OP and looking to get both sets of skins.
---
&gt;Worst case scenario he'll get a forced name change
---
Right. He's autistic however and i want him to have a smooth as possible experience, just like my nephew who's disabled. That's why i advised against it. But him being autistic is also the reason he pretty much insists on using his own name.  
---
&gt; But I would still advise against using your IRL name for a character. 
---
I mean, sure i would agree on that if you had both name and last name. But given that his name is the most common name in the world, i don't see an issue in that regard.
---
I'm starting to question if anyone is really gonna be offended enough to report it?
---
This requires a multi map farm tho. Once the hype is over those are going to become harder to find if they dont disappear entirely.
---
Even if you don't want to build it, still buy the parts individually yourself. Any respectable brick and mortar computer store will have a PC building service, usually $50 or so. 
---
Go to /r/buildapc and get help picking the parts. Then hit up your local spot, see if the pricing is on par and just buy everything from there and have them build it for you - or buy the components online and bring it to them to build.
---
I'm thinking more of a clipping thru whole charr body when the character runs on all 4

[GW2 Naming Policy](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-naming-policy/)
---
"*We do not permit names that: ..Reference religious or historical figures*"
---
Just invert it, and nobody will notice it: Demmahum.
---
He wouldn't be banned for using the name, but it is possible that Anet would force him to change the name for free. As others have said, he shouldn't use his real name in the game.
---
I thought maybe it was an echo effect and/or the same voice actress saying the line twice then overlapped.
---
No one was hyperbole, but we didn't see threads here exclaiming "Aurene has a voice!" like you would expect if it had been widely realized.
---
The thing about the last boss of Siren's Reef is that the harder you try, the harder it gets. The more you dps the boss, the more adds spawn. So if you focus on the adds, you will have an easier time.
---
That said, with the right composition, you can totally try-hard the boss, which is why basically nobody really focuses on the adds.
---
ask support, not reddit
---
Here is the naming policy: https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-naming-policy/
---
The parts:
---
- Reference religious or historical figures
---
- Reference real-life people
---
might conflict with it. On the other hand, the worst thing that can happen is a forced rename.
---
Flesh golems is one of the best elites for necromancers, it's been ages since I've seen anyone using Lich Form, plaguelands won't be as useful for open world content and the elites for each specialization feel more like PVP stuff. (at least to me)
---
What's this trick? &gt;&gt;
---
they can't ban the name if it's only part of it
---
I read that, but take it with a grain of salt.  
---
I mean, Braham is literally short for or another way of naming someone Abraham, which is Hebrew for the father of all. Braham is a main character to in the GW2 story, yet my nephew's friend can't use his own name. Isn't that incredibly contradictory?
---
hello,
---
The only way to obtain legendary armor in GW2 (legendary has the same stats as ascended, but the stats are swappable to any set in the game, at any time, as many times as you want) is through raids.
---
This statement is false.
---
you can also earn legendary gear from wvw and pvp.
---
Shattered Observatory, Twilight Oasis, Thaumanova &amp; Siren's Reef would be the Fractals to avoid with inexperienced groups.  These Fractals tend to be long, scale badly and become more difficult with certain instabilities and/or bad builds and DPS.  Sometimes you won't be able to carry people on these if the instabilities are too rough.  
---
*  Surviving in T4 =/= Thriving in T4s.  There's a pretty distinct difference. 
---
* You need to play a build and practice a rotation that scales with boons; most notably, quickness &amp; alacrity. 
---
* You should probably be running something from Discretize or Snowcrows; don't play homebrew and run *good* food.  
---
* You should put an emphasis on working towards an Infinite Mist Omni-Potion; and running recs prior to T4's.  
---
* Mistlock potions are extremely powerful and playing without them during harder Fractals isn't smart.  
---
I'd recommend Dragonhunter, Holosmith, Power Soulbeast and maybe Reaper.  If you really want to get carried and you're willing to learn and improve then setup either a Heal Quickbrand, ~~Power Quickbrand~~ or Diviner Renegade.   Most of the groups that pug below 100 essences aren't going to run a Power Quickbrand in favor of the safety and security offered by hQuickbrand &amp; Renegade. 
---
The reason I'd recommend these classes is because they have fairly simple, straight-forward rotations.  I've never had a particularly good string of experiences with pug Elementalists outside of Fractal CMs.  If you want to play Elementalist then practice your rotation or GTFO because all you offer is DPS and if you suck at doing DPS on Elementalist then you're basically useless.  
---
es and Fractal specific mechanics.  Most of the time when you're pugging non-CM Fractals you'll be lucky if your DPS players can break 10k DPS.
---
No.
---
Capes. 
---
I want capes.
---
I'm a little rusty on the ToS, but the rules in place for naming include provisions prohibiting character names that are directly pulled from major historical figures, and notable fictional characters.
---
And at the same time, ANet will even grant an *account* name change if your account ID (the one with the 4 numbers after it) contains your real name, as everyone can see it, and it could be used for fraud/doxxing.
---
So whichever way you want to tackle it.  Personally, I'd use it as a teachable moment for online safety and anonymity.
---
&gt;he shouldn't use his real name in the game.
---
why? Muhammed is the most common name in the world.
---
I saw a player yesterday that was literally named "Jesus Christ."
---
If you don't mind me asking, what's keeping you from buying the episodes you're missing?  It sounds like you enjoy the game a lot.
---
If I had known that my deduction was not the obvious one, then I would have posted something to that effect. But it was obvious to me so I didn't post anything. I thought most people would have caught it. It gave me chills to hear Aurene's voice speak through Caithe, and I thought it was a beautiful moment. My favorite of that chapter actually.
---
Reddit imo has a good amount of experience to ask about these kind of things. People will have experienced forced name changes and people may have been able to "get away" with names that could be considered wrong to the TOS. Hence why i ask here rather then ask support who will highly likely send me a link to the Character name TOS.
---
I'm more of a fan of sleek armor so its overall a bit chunky for my taste. Also my main colour schemes are usual blue or purple so the red dragon glow reeeeallly does not match. Heavy and light get fairly 'plain' pale white draw effects and medium gets bright fucking red? Hello?
---
Merely speaking to you in a language that you might comprehend.
---
Guardians should have the most majestic capes.
---
I'd prefer capes/cloacks over wings.
---
you oddly seem way more interested in making this ridiculous argument than in helping your nephew's friend.
---
My point is, people could easily relate Braham to the religious figure Abraham as it's name is basically one and the same in meaning and it's a shorter version of Abraham. That doesn't mean the character Braham is named Abraham.  
---
So could my nephew's friend maybe use Muhamed rather then Muhammed? Or Mohammed? Since it's not exactly the same, he should be good, right?
---
they can get a little troublesome with certain instabilities but then again that also applies to every fractal. if people say that the fractal itself is too hard they are probably trying to punch their way through a door instead of trying to figure out how to open it. siren reef is a good example of how that mentality can kill you if you don't try to adapt, you can force your way through if you can outdps the boss and ignore the spawning mobs, or you can kill the mobs when they spawn and slowly but surely whittle the boss down.
---
the people that say siren reef is too hard are the ones that try to outdps it while ignoring the mobs without having the damage/skill to actually do it. and of course they will say that it is the fractals fault for being too hard rather than trying to improve themselves or put in the effort to think of a different way to resolve the issue
---
the problem is i didnt actually start on LS5 until 2 days ago lol
---
Could he use Mumahed or Mohammed then rather then Muhammed? Since it's not the same but kinda is like Braham and Abraham.
---
Not voting in your poll, it's blocked by my company computer.
---
I enjoy getting a Hero Choice Chest for the content I was engaging with anyway and not having to book it to Dragon's Stand/HoT to get one (loathe those maps.) I'm also thrilled to see more interest in these metas as it's helping to get some achievements I had resigned to never get (like all worms surviving through the entirety of Junundu Rising. One **always** died, minimum, because I had never run it with more than maybe 15 people).
---
yeak, i figured out a plan of action and excluding the mistborn motes (i will prob just do them tonight) i can get the rest of the mats in 3 days, including today after the reset, so i'll be done by saturday. i spent over 5 hours straight just getting 100 % on the maps on 2 characters, 3 for jahai.
---
You can excuse yourself at any given time if you think this has become a ridiculous argument.
---
I just picked it up. Norn also have six.

yeah i got the ground layed out and i should be done by this saturday

You can try to rationalize it all you want, but the name of an NPC doesn't set any precedent for their player naming policies.  Try to use the name, if they don't like it they'll force a name change according to their policies.  This is their rule in their world, we can guess as well as you can but it's ultimately Anet's call.
---
&gt;You can try to rationalize it all you want, but the name of an NPC doesn't set any precedent for their player naming policies.  Try to use the name

Doesn't bother me personally, but it's not consistent and for me it adds confusion.  
---
&gt; This is their rule in their world, we can guess as well as you can but it's ultimately Anet's call.

Right, i was hoping someone could chime in and say: "I've been using "fill in religious name variant here" for years and all is well."
---
If you have: 250 of each LWS4 map currency, 35G and 500 trade contracts, Sun's Refuge unlocked, the Runelocked Doors achievement done (or the ability to TP to friend into the rooms), the ingredients to make the food ( 300 Bloodstone, 60 Ecto, 24 Red Meat, and 12 Charged Quartz) or the money to buy off TP (4G atm), a grow lamp (400 jewelcrafting, timegated charged quartz, other mats) or the money to buy off TP (30G atm)... at least 4 days, I'd say. If you need currencies, don't have gold, need charged quartz it will take longer. 
---
The first 3 collections can be done in a few hours or less if you use TACO markers. 2 hour wait for the next collection to unlock, then you can feed it four times a day. It needs to be fed 12 times, so this will take a minimum of 3 days. 
---
After that is another collection where you do some JPs and bosses. These can be skipped if you make Skyscale Treats. Then you play hide and seek and catch. Wait 2 more hours for the final collection, then complete. 
---
[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/brs41g/complete_skyscale_unlock_guide/) will walk you through it with WPs and everything.
---
The people in that group just weren't all that good at fractals. Which is fine, but, Siren's Reef isn't so bad that it's worth skipping when it shows up.
---
The new fractals overall are longer and have more punishing mechanics. So, yeah, I think it's fair to say that they're harder.
---
But they're not leagues above the rest. It's all about learning how to deal with mechanics and optimize for the fractal. For Siren's Reef in particular there are multiple strategies that will help. Projectile reflection/destruction, more cleave, you can stack Scourges for the barrier and epi, good condi cleanse helps a ton so heal tempest can make it pretty nice...
---
Ultimately everything will come down to DPS of course. If your party has poor DPS it's gonna take a long fractal with punishing mechanics and turn it into a nightmare.
---
It's just a matter of improving. : ).
---
Sorting them by difficulty is hard. For instance, Mai Trin, in a really good party, is one of the easiest fractals. Very farmable. However if the party doesn't know what they're doing, it quickly becomes a huge pain in the ass.
---
Still, if I had to sort them by difficulty...I'll sort them by the ones I feel my friends struggle the most with. I'd say we're a pretty good fractal group. If I had to grade us on a scale of F to S, I'd give us like a B+ to an A-. Honestly though for me, after Deepstone, they're all *really* close. It's super hard to rank them.
---
The ones I listed higher just have a mechanic or two that tends to be a pain in the ass and can sometimes wipe us. The panel room on Underground, Subject 6/the last boss of Thauma, sometimes Mai Trin with certain instabs just sucks, every once in a while Bloomhunger gets out of sync with us on Swampland or one person dies and then it sucks getting them back up. That kind of stuff.

What's baffling about this instance, is it doesn't seem like just a simple oversight. In the initial announcement for the event, they explicitly stated that the defense events would not reward bonus chests, meaning they had considered it, and chose to exclude the defense events, either due to some technical concern (I'm skeptical, given they just changed it) or as a conscious design decision (maybe they were worried about awarding too many boxes?).

 - Purple as it is for Mesmers

 - Green-yellow (Soulbeast swirling colors) for Rangers (and change it to blue-white when in Celestial attunement as a Druid)
---
 - Revenant orbs change color with each stance like the energy that engulfs their hands
---
 - Thief gets shadowy ones with tints of red, more red-orange when a Deadeye has a target marked
---
 - Engineer gets little plasma orbs ranging the spectrum of orange to red to purple, while Holosmith gets golden orbs when in Holo mode and Scrappers gets several little whirring gizmos
---
 - Necromancer gets little ephemeral skulls in green-black flames, with Scourge changing them to mini-Sand Shades
---
 - Warrior gets silvery orbs which turn to gold on Spellbreaker and turn bright red while a Berserker is in Berserk mode.
---
No bamboozle, that guy is really nice. He's a really skilled raider and very pleasant.
---
The dev said that there is some number of additional recipe unlocks that were /are supposed to happen.
---
I know about it, and BECAUSE OF THAT KNOWLEDGE I'd tell them to save time and stick to stuff that is actually good instead of applying every style to every kind of weapon and armor.
---
You know, like other games developers already do successfully.
---
The market prices for skins can give you an idea of how popular they are and most collections have a few very popular skins and a lot of less popular ones, because the style looks bad on them.
---
Craft 400 shards for an offhand (Friendship, for example) then [convert them](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Enormous_Chest_of_Legendary_Shards#Notes) into 300 shards of the 2H you want. Saves about 75g and a decent chunk of whatever currency you buy tributes with.

---
Ahhh, thank you!
---
This is already a thing, at least for the Temple of Balthazar (and pretty sure the other ones too).  From the wiki:
---
&gt; After gaining the temple, it remains friendly for about 1:45 hours after which an event spawns to defend it. If successful, it will remain open for about one more hour after which a much more difficult defend event triggers - with victory conditions such that failure is essentially certain.

New fractals are all quite easy on t4, as long as you have good players - and theres the real rub. Currently most fractal players dont have any clue how to properly adapt their builds to counter certain mechanics/instabilities. And since Anet doesnt force you to do that content, most just dont even try higher levels anymore.
---
Tbh, currently, pugging t4 fractals and raids is absolutely horrible, your chances to get passable groupmates is extremely low.
---
If you are interested in doing t4 fractals and/or raids, then Id suggest going to the trouble of looking for a static. You'll have way more fun that way and you'll realize that gw2 is a really easy game at its core, and only players unreasonable fixation on running the worst possible teamcomps is what makes it difficult.

I love account bound. I wish all soulbound objects were account bound instead.

Getting a group of 10- first time raid and you can clear in 20 min?

Green name tags are (generally) tameable creatures. Sometimes they take a bit to spawn in. They must be Juveniles, Baby/hatchling/etc don't count.
---
That you haven't found a single one is odd, though. Not even a Pig in Queensdale or a Jungle Stalker in Caledon?

Actually, their initial announcement specifically mentioned that the defense events were excluded for this iteration of the event.

&gt; I also want to note that, for this version of the World Meta Event, we did not have enough time to make any changes to the Defend events that occur as a part of the Arah Metas. These defend events will kick off like normal after a successful attack and do not have additional rewards for completing them. It is our intention to address this if we run another event that targets the Arah Meta attack events, but we won’t be able to do that for this event.

It's amazing how you can claim that literally everyone who finds the skyscale to be more effective than the springer just "never bothered to learn how to handle the mount", "not using their head", and "lazy"...but somehow **I** am the egotist. 
---
It's absolutely amazing how you railed for five consecutive posts about how people just needed to learn2play with the springer, ignoring all presented evidence (bet you still haven't watched that video) and replying with your own anecdotal responses about how you saw one guy fail with the springer. You literally admitted that you drew your conclusions from that observation, and you claim that **I** am acting like /r/iamverysmart.
---
I'm fully comfortable with trading barbs with you, because 1) I didn't start out acting like a know-it-all, 2) I **did** very politely point out how your own words were being taken as snooty, and you doubled down, and 3) I'm only insulting you. You've insulted the intelligence of every person who disagrees with you. 
---
I'm standing on firm ground here. Keep it up, you have nothing but a bag of hot air.
---
What
---
Maybe you have to be level 15?  That's when Profession Skill 4 unlocks, which for Ranger is Pet Swap.  I'm pretty sure you can do it before then though.
---
I actually love this
---
Good to know ;)
---
What kind of build does your tempest use ? Camp Staff water with arcane like in raid ? Or more balanced one like the full auramancer one I presented ? Or else :)
---
I do believe it’s a level based thing- lvl 15 or something
---
Pretty easy (but time consuming) way to check which ones will be rewarded is to go through all the weapon skins from the datamine post for last update. The ones that still aren't on the tp are *probably* the ones unlocked through the event.
---
Even if you dont want to build it yourself, its better to buy parts that fit good together and pay a little bit to some store to build it for you, instead of buying some non optimized and overpriced prebuilt.
---
I am in Metrica Province looking for Jaguar or jungle spiders i am at the locations the guides i have read suggest but nothing is appearing.
---
Do i need the expansions or a certain level?
---
Juvenile animals are not phased.  Spawning sputs usually have 1-3, and if other players got them, they won't be there for a while. Search the nearby area for other spawns, wait for one to respawn, or look in another spawning spot.
---
Nobody cares dude, you think anybody is reading any of this shit? This post is old and nobody reads this far into comment chains. You’re yelling at a wall buddy.

**Matriarch take you!**

I KNOW THE PIECES FIT!

And it will help those with potato setup to actually get credit killing something instead of missing because of graphic (and sometimes latency) lag.
---
I would rather run with a heal tempest than a druid 10/10 times.
---
Lucky me i don't have to since i main healbrand.
---
Also where are all these mythical CMs where you run solo heals? Because each and every time i ask if people would rather have me as quickbrand i get a hard no.
---
Path to Ascension needs to be reworked to work around the 20 minute wait.  In another thread, I suggested changing the order of events, starting with the wild magic and ending with Josso for the Hero's Choice chest.  Then people who want to explore Augury Rock and do the Verses have their twenty minutes to do so, while others can leave the map if they'd rather.
---
Maws of Torment still has buggy NPCs last I checked, so I'm thankful for the update to Junundu Rising to let it give the Hero's Choice chest as well.. moreso now that its own bug has been fixed.  And having Forged with Fire being available and rewarding is good too, as it can be a fun fight but it was like pulling teeth to get people to do it before, as much due to its incomprehensibly bad schedule (two and a half hours between events?  It wasn't even at the same time each day) as due to its subpar rewards.
---
If you’re new to PoF then that’s just cuz you don’t have all the mounts yet. Raptor is the most basic mount (basically just a faster version of your normal character with a long jump). You’ll unlock up to 6 more after you’re done
---
It's a bug basically. Right now if you have one of the trinkets on a Mesmer (so the base effect), the Mesmer clones will have the combined effect. Then if you have the combined effect on your Mesmer, it's clones will have that black orb thing. We have no idea if this is some planned form 3 (maybe related to the raid legendary accessory?), or some bugged unintended thing.
---
You get the 3rd effect on mesmer clones when you have both trinkets equipped. People are guessing it is the intended effect for when you have 3 legendary trinkets equipped. You can't get it on your actual character yet.
---
meteors drop a decent amount of those too

---
&gt; Hi everyone, we’re aware that some players are experiencing issues with the Extra-Pungent Skyscale Treat. The recipe only unlocks on a single character rather than account wide, and some players who unlocked the recipe are no longer able to craft it. We’re working on a fix and will have it in as soon as possible. In the meantime, there is a workaround for some of you who are experiencing either of these problems. If you have started but not yet completed the Skyscale Lost collection, you can speak to Gorrik to get the recipe again. That will fix the problem for you. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Thank you for your patience while we work on getting this fixed!
---
Aah I see, and here I thought that I missed a secret step while crafting Vision lol. Thanks !
---
Hit level 15 like everyone else is suggesting, that'll do it.
---
...Also, I heard the words "I'm" and "new".
---
HELLO THERE. If you ever need help in game, you can DM me and I'll drop my in-game tag c:
---
Same, reason for the rant XD
---
I think his character name was "Warr is OP" or something to that extent
---
is the armor also a gemstore outfit? It looks amazing.
---
I read: My Reaper, Vagina
---
Two words:

Fashion

Wars

Yeah, he shows up to carry 100cm runs that have lost all hope every now and then.  Few months back someone teased him about not being a fractal god and he went, "That would be blasphemy, my son."
---
Normally I go on with my day when I observe an absurd statement such as this.
---
But for this one time only I shall state this:
---
Git Gud, dodging it is very easy, just like dodging through any other shockwave attack.
---
People pay attention to tags without an event up?
---
I had no idea that I desperately needed that until now.
---
You mean Brisban Wildlands, yeah? That's where those two are, according to the guide. Have you tamed the pets in Rata Sum?
---
Man, this was my fav event. Wish I could play the game again, but my computer just can’t handle it anymore.
---
Yass
---
Troll is full of shit. "1800 hours in 6 years" and he doesn't have season 4, or don't want want to buy it, even though he doesn't 'mind'? Bullshit.
---
GW1 environments have aged pretty well, it's so fun going back and revisiting some of the areas we used to roam years ago.
---
What if they write bubbles as a good guy who helps with prim and jormag ?
---
We spend a fortune to buy and craft backpacks....Capes would just be useless, and hide all the work we did.
---
I guess another bug for Aurora effect. Another is orbs disappear after death and the only way to get them back is relog or unequip and equip again... annoying for 3k gold legendary
---
This comment is everything that's wrong with the gw2 pve community. I always hear people saying pvpers or wvwers are the most toxic players, but in my experiences it's usually the super casual open world pvers that get super pissy and toxic towards any content that isn't relaxed and easy.
---
Hey, keep it exclusive. Worked well the last five years, didn't it. See you 2023 for the next wing.
---
i personally like this build the one you've shown, but just don't wanna let go of my commander gears lol. you know what i meant, it was so damn hard to pull all the resources to get a full commander geared leadership rune chrono, and that was why they were so valuable back in time! i played my current build last night, still effective since i could hold agro and the alacrity and quickness uptime were flawless just with spamming skills
---
Check it man, put a ring of stamina on that GS. I've been running it in dragon fall and during some mobs I can't tag and press Dodge fast enough to keep up the ambushes. And if you are afraid of not tagging fast enough hit with a #3. Or even just grab shifting sands for aoe tag
---
I don't know why you got downvoted into oblivion
---
What about the Mystic Forge thing? That still going to continue?  
---
Missed that achieve.
---
Necro is a lot of fun plus you can't die
---
There's a free chest next to the pillars in picture 8 that I used to run once a month, the plant mesmers and their slows are such a headache, 10/10 would do again
---
Aurora was the biggest fuckfest of everything. I would say aside from that, any of the gen2 legendaries that had a ton of tedious collections like the first three HOPE, astralaria, and nevermore are probably the most time-intensive of the weapons. I don't know when the cutoff was for them to switch from doing those collections to making big gold requirements was, but the shining blade was really easy to make for me as long as I had a lot of gold to piss away for it.
---
Explore all core Tyria maps 100%. It also gives you the title.
---
How can you even do that, though? You have to craft in order to use gold and crafted ascendant requires materials from fractals, doesn't it?
---
Tangentially related post to point out that Ascent: Infinite Realm is basically BDO in the sky with steampunk stuff.
---
If i remember correctly its when you have the map 100% explored with that charakter.
---
The effort:profit ratio is probably too low to be bothered with, especially if you want the capes to move, like at all.
---
Well the time you spend running around in there just for story and map completion should be enough to see the broadcast message at least once. More if you go for achievements.
---
I have been there and I'm not sure if it had anything to do with the design of desert highlands, but the area is known to have inspired the landscape in the movie Avatar. There is a tourist spot there where you can take a photo with a statue of a Na'vi
---
[pcpartspicker.com](https://pcpartspicker.com) will also help you find that build's cheapest websites (per part).  My newest build was 90% amazon lol
---
You could get this effect with Spectral Greatsword
---
Don’t forget dolyak mounts for WvW pls
---
there was an asuran study at launch of gw2, that explained in detail how capes are bad and make you die more frequent.

please read up on the sience before asking for nonsense, you bookah!

why waste a gemstone?
---
Reduced wait times for bans lol  one bad joke after how many fugging years since my last ban and ,,first off they do not tell you the length of the ban. WTF if they can punish you for doing something unthoughfulll how about rewarding people for being thoughtful like I do every day helping people in many ways...nope just look at the complaint and pull out the instructions manual for bad jokes that are not racial or hate directed and bam,,banned
---
wonder how many people leave  games because of bans....I know they don't care as they are not loosing a subscription. I already took my GW 2 money I usually will spend and bought some other games from steam....and looking for another mmorpg to play,,,downloaded dota2  but I could not get into it..anyone else have any recomendations..this game was getting old anyways and at the very least its always good to have a backup to fall onto ,,,which I do not
---
thank you
---
It's a PSA not a wish. :)
---
Bond of faith 100% of the time unmerges me. The rest of the time it's seemingly random, and the longer I stay mounted, the more likely I'll come out separated. Sort of like the game just forgets about it.
---
What's really funny is when they have the bloodstone cat from LW3 and the squirt gun
---
that means the technology is there
---
Serpent Ire with full map seem ok now but still long becuase majority of people still dont split and search. IMO that brand strom tick should go away or be an aoe like Thunderhead peak.
---
This might also be related to the weird delay when you swap mounts: if you mount up too fast after swapping you'll get up on your previous mount. Maybe I'll just try to slow down a bit!
---
owo
---
i dont think you have to worry about motes too much, i was just doing meta started from 0 then after the event i had like 70 plus
---
Wtf?!?!?!?
---
I'd swap out virtues for radiance personally if you're planning on going for PvE, and take advantage of the retaliation based traits (bottom line of radiance).

How's the longbow like for it now? I remember being excited to get it, but never really got a chance to use it.

u want to aim for this setup
---
Which has absolutely nothing to do with raiders choking their own gamemode to death because heaven forbid filthy casuals are allowed to experience their hallowed content. Let alone nuking all hope for higher, more demanding difficulties.
---
Freaks. No, really. Freaks. There is no *sane* explanation for that fervent hate and raging nerdboner for absolute exclusivity which must be maintained no matter the cost. If raiders would at least lose something by getting a bigger playerbase, then it'd be easy to understand.
---
Thank fuck it's not MY gamemode that's being held hostage in that psychotic stranglehold. Mine already got deprived of all so sorely needed fresh blood by its "veterans". WvWers did exactly the same, watching it from the sidelines happening to another gamemode is kind of strange, but also funny in a morbid kind of way.
---
But whatever. The next raid is around the corner and I'm sure all three people and their dog going to have a blast for at least three days before its back to waiting another 6++ months for the next charity wing while cutting off your nose to spite your face. That'll show dem fucking toxic casuals clamouring for less archaic game systems!

It's still bad.
---
Removed: Post just to advertise your stream.
---
Pretty big since you are losing on quite a bit of Condition Duration and 7% of condi damage applied to condies that don't stack just as much is juste not worth it. It's even more visible for Lich because you still have a 4% so the potential "bonus" of Renegade is even smaller.
---
What about the scepter/focus combo makes it good? I'm unfamiliar with the weapon combination and its skills.
---
&gt; Can someone sort all the T4 fractals by difficulty? Would be super helpful
---
IMO from easiest to hardest:
---
20. Molten Furnance  
---
19. Solid Ocean

18. Volcanic  
---
17. Molten Boss  
---
16. Cliffside

15. Uncategorized

14. Aquatic Ruins

13. Aetherblade

12. Underground Facility

11. Urban Battlegrounds

10. Nightmare

9. Chaos Isles

8. Captain Mai Trin

7. Snowblind

6. Deepstone  
---
5. Swampland  
---
4. Thaumanova Reactor  
---
5. Shattered Observatory  
---
4. Twilight Oasis  
---
3. Nightmare Challenge Mode  
---
2. Siren's Reef  
---
1. Shattered Observatory Challenge Mode
---
I'll check those traits out now, thank-you :)
---
This this this ^
---
GW2 has unintentionally created a community of super pissy toxic casuals who justify watering down any content because "I only have 3 hours to play!"
---
People keep downvoting me whenever I say this, but I will not stop saying this because it's true. Toxic casuals need to stop ruining GW2 with their entitlement.
---
Look at LS4Ep6. Nevermind the cutscenes and story. Strip everything down to its raw gameplay. The final boss was *complete and utter* **HORSE SHIT**! It may as well have been a cutscene. But if ANET dare made it harder, toxic casuals would complain "But I only have 3 hours to play! BUT I ONLY HAVE 3 HOURS TO PAY!!!! BUTIONLYHAVE3HOURSTOPLAY!!!!!! **BUTIONLYHAVE3HOURSTOPLAY!!!!!!**"
---
What a joke.
---
Wow look at that wall. I'm not reading a word of it but I hope you enjoyed writing it.
---
What?
---
Just checked now its its already Tier 3 and it hasnt been 3 days yet. I think Arenanet might have to add more tiers 🤣
---
&gt; Yeah. Just give me a refund for the 16 gold I spent on materials and we'll call it even.
---
Except it’s entirely optional in the first place?  You could always sell the mats back or wait on the fix.
---
They aren't pushing them as they don't do them anymore. They just don't really go back and fix old content
---
I'm not a good warrior (fairly new to pvp but I'm improving) but other professions seem more manageable compared to mesmers. I see a mesmer and i run lol
---
No strawmen there, I stated that the way the comments are in these kind of threads it appears like a lot of anet accounts are using them. 
---
I also put it in a humorous way. 
---
I also think that people who find these kind of gemstore items shit should post more often. 
---
Now which part did you miss? The "skin is shit" or the joke?
---
I loled have an up doot
---
Tom of the Primeval King’s (6 chests, don’t miss the one under the stairs) with multiple alt characters you don’t play often is my go to.  It’s an easy and fast ~15-30 contracts per character per day.
---
I feel the same about holos.  I'm not really familiar with warrior or ide give you some suggestions.
---
The best is the Curious Bowl (Breaking the Bank) in the Derelict Delve mini dungeon. If you're fine with RNG
---
Either people suddenly remembered what CC is or the breakbar at Serpents Ire is now basicly non existant after the nerf.
---
the /u/Portrait_Prophecies saga continues
---
Also it's the same mecha we fought 3 seconds before in small.
---
Well... when HoT came out.... people who bought vanilla had to buy HoT.  Those who jumped in with HoT got vanilla free....
---
Awww okay! Will try first without and see how it goes :)
---
Dead lfg
---
Tier 12... everyone gets legendaries!
---
Will see how it goes! They say stuff was improved and balanced since then, but the menacing feel remains, which I like.
---
Next level? People have been doing voyeur for years
---
Git gd
---
And chances of getting credit would be pretty much guaranteed. As it is now, the chances of it melting before you get to it are pretty high.
---
Well said. That basically sums it up for me as well.
---
Expectations based on previous collections I think. People are used to getting a mount from an hour of story or a little bit of gold. They're also used to paying thousands of gold and going through a bunch of long ass collections for aurora, or legendary weaps/armours.
---
&gt;lisa,  it wasn't short for Elizabeth
---
is is
---
&gt;Dana, not short for Daniel
---
well yeah. because it isn't.
---
&gt;Em, not short for Emma
---
em is short for plenty of things because it's a nickname and nothing else
---
&gt;Then you get into Anna being short for Susanna
---
in no cases will you ever get into this
---
&gt;continuing with fucking josh of all things in later post
---
jesus. fucking. christ.
---
&gt;!braham is nonsense tho so I GUESS your dumbass anna - susanna example has a valid point!&lt;
---
You can't sell the mats back. I bought the cultures to help someone else through the collection, but the recipe does not complete for me on the character that got the recipe.
---
Except the whole idea of the pieces being visually distinct was also their stupid explanation for the trench coat things on all the medium armor, so I guess Anet is unsurprisingly inconsistent. I'm not sure why you're so anti-consumer here. Literally almost every single piece of armor clips with the Charr tails which could be remedied by slightly modifying the pieces to accommodate the appendage that juts out from their asses. Note that this is literally the only thing I ever complained about so all of your assumptions are coming out of nowhere. I guess I do think that if they are going to include a playable race they should be responsible for attending to that small detail because a good number of players are going to, you know, play the fucking cat people. Apparently I can only make those complaints if I hold a majority share of Anets stocks though. 
---
The rest of that is another bunch of assumptions about me and some more hand-waving for things that could be simply solved if Anet actually gave a shit. The most prestigious rewards in this game have less customization options than shit you can buy for 10 bucks off the gemstore. That's a legitimate thing to complain about.
---
Hilarious is one way of putting it. I cannot fathom what they were thinking with their PR between the episodes.
---
&gt; Calls himself a wall. 
---
. 
---
&gt; Says he doesn't give a shit, while continuing to give a shit enough to respond.
---
&gt; Says I have a social disorder, while admitting he's just trying to troll.

I didn't even know they were there! What did I miss?!
---
Hey I once ran across an NPC where you could trade in Exquisite ruby jewel for something... Anyone know this?
---
Omg, I imagined being able to walk by a lute player at some meta event, grabbing it, and bashing it on the nearest wall. "Sorry..."
---
Idk if you saw what the glider looks on charr, but theres one grabbing onto your tail and it completes me.
---
Implemented all of the maps in my gemstone runs. Dobble is annoying tho.
---
Guardian.
---
More build diversity than warrior in high level pve, with a meta dps option, a hybrid support, and heal build, all of which are amazing for fractals. There’s a condi variant if you want that too. Warrior is stuck with core bannerslave, which doesn’t get much dps out, and does t get as good dps as dps guard. With berserker elite, you have a mediocre power build and a clunky condi build.
---
Guard also has access to aegis for easy blocks in general pve, and has one of the best heal skills in the game that makes you pretty much invincible as long as you dps.
---
It is doubling. The gif starts with my 4 orbs, then when i kneel the extra 4 spawn.
---
We just had to adapt after the first 3 wipes doing it the normal way. Got 2 healers plus the Chrono support.  Focused on killing the adds instead of the boss. Really easy. Although lot of yelling to focus adds not boss lol
---
I always do.
---
My ex-wife got into a guild war with the local Mexican gangs in our city she put spicy peppers in all of their lunch boxes when they weren’t looking and ended up defeating the whole tri-state area
---
I think they made a huge mistake by ditching [HoT's outpost model](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Outpost), together with [map meta events](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Map_meta_event). HoT meta events flow really well, and they could have followed something similar for PoF. Instead, we have multiple random events no one knows of, a fact that gets worse due to the increased map sizes.
---
For example, Vabbi is the clearest regarding this:
---
* **Northwest:** Help around Vehjin Palace, drive the Forged away, and assault the Foundry. Final boss: Forged Hounds.
---
* **Southwest:** Help around the necropolis. Final boss: The judges.
---
* **Southeast:** Help around Vehtendi Academy. Eventually progress into the Brand, and enter the Hanging Gardens. Final boss: Djinn quartet.
---
* **Northeast:** Help around the Garden of Seborhin. Eventually progress into the Brand. Final boss: Serpent's Ire.
---
The map itself could have a huge final boss, in the form of PoF's final story mission, which could have an open world version. Many story-only battles would play far better in the open world anyway.
---
To be fair, most of the problems with dynamic events across the game are because of communication. One of the greatest things about HoT is that the map meta event UI told you everything that was going on in the area, so you never missed an event.
---
This and go with thief!
---
[This cover is amazing, and by far my favorite piece of GW2 fan music.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUaCk-9IJ64)
---
If all of the gangs take their lunch break at the same time, they have some really questionable leadership.
---
That was a great explanation.  G2.5 legendaries aren’t as fun to do as g2, they are all basically the same combos.  With your masteries in place, and enough cash g2.5 really only depend on HoT (or PoF) amp completion and currencies.
---
G2 legendaries are challenging and an adventure.  As op stated some are better than others.  However they seem more rewarding as you have about 100 subtasks (fractals, map metas, jumping puzzles, etc.)
---
The reality is that you should go for the weapon you are going to use the most.  One you decide on that weapon determine which version of that weapon you want.
---
The only thing I’d add is that the g2 legendaries are significantly more expensive overall.
---
Reminds me when Vyse spied on Aika.
---
*onlydreamcast/gamecubekidsrememberdis*
---
*lykeifucrievrytyme*
---
You need to read some feedback on how anet operates, their top down management is poor and there is poor communication between teams and management.
---
Well, I guess it depends on a number of factors. Some people make legendaries for the prestige factor. Some are just completionists and want to unlock every skin. I'm more of the latter than the former, but that's not the reason I make legendaries.
---
There are two. All any MMO ever really becomes is a list of stuff to do. Because at the end of the day, once you finish the story in most games, the game is pretty much over, much like watching a TV series. Adventure games and RPGs anyway. You play them, you win, and generally you move on. 
---
Some games renew themselves through mods like Skyrim, where you're always playing a slightly different game, but even Skyrim didn't give me more hours than MMOs I've played.
---
MMOs eventually come down to busy work. If you're a raider, that's your busywork. Doing the same raids over and over again. Me, I'm an altoholic. I like making characters and getting them through content, but just not the same thing over and over again, because my characters are themed. I have a norn pirate that looks awesome, but unfornately he's a ranger, because the legendary rifle that looks like a ship would have been perfect for him. It would have fit the character.
---
To me, if a legendary looks like a character would have it, I want it to be part of that character's look and feel. This is the same with minipets, mount skins and titles for me. I don't need every title, but when the Salty Sea Dog title came out, I had to have it for my pirate character (along with the privateer runes so he could should yarr from time to time and summon a parrot).   It's part of the game's customization for me.

I have 43 characters now. Some are themed more on a realistic theme, some are just jokes. I have a character named Rytlock Brimstem, who's a Sylvari warrior in a guild called Hedge of Destiny.  It's just something that I thought would be fun.

It keeps me busy, it keeps me playing and I'm having fun.

I should mention that I don't grind for legendaries either. I cheat a lot of it.  I have ten accounts most of which I bought dirt cheap and I log in on them every day (using gw2 launch buddy to save time). I only really play 2 of the accounts. The other eight fund my legendary habit with mystic coins (I do the mystic forge dailies on those accounts and laurels. I don't mind running dragon stand for Crystalline Ore, because I enjoy Dragon Stand.  I enjoy WvW so gifts of battle aren't really an issue for me.  And I don't mind completing the world or HoT zones on different characters, because I find it relaxing.

Probably a longer answer than you wanted, but there you are. lol

Skyscale collection after you finish Dragonfall stories to get the new mount. Gorrik put them there to raise them.

So adorable!

I don't believe it's true. I get recipes semi-regularly and they sell for a decent amount.

Stick with Guardian!

Way more versetile in all gamemodes, really solid class!

Yes. Anet not doing anything is the reason people make posts about it. Otherwise they would 100% continue to do nothing. This way they might actually do something. That's how the whole thing works. And look, a lot of the new charr armors don't have tail issues. Wow! It's almost like consumers can actually impact the thing they are spending money on by providing feedback! They've done plenty of retroactive changes to this game so I see no reason why pointing these things should be ignored because they haven't been fixed yet.

It's still there! I keep GW1 installed at all times, log in once in a while to do a VQ then log out again.

Although I do enjoy your passion for the Vabbi meta too, you should keep doing what makes you happy :&gt;

Yes

If they havent fixed it yet, the mechanics only start for the final boss when you step onto the ship, but the boss is in range from one of the small islands before getting on the ship and can be killed easily.  The boat is a trap.  Akhbar is needed for this fractal

I'm confused on how to get participation credit. I did a full dragon's stand earlier and I have no completions done. Am I supposed to just get an achievement? A random chest? I got no idea what's going on.

-suddenly gets might, fury, quickness, and weakness, and confusion-

Requiem is pretty expensive because of all the sigils of nullification you need.

I was in this vid 😀

I just noticed the week-long bonus events, and it gives bonus boxes of good. What exactly the items i can get from them? Is there a super rare infusion drop like the last world boss rush or something?
