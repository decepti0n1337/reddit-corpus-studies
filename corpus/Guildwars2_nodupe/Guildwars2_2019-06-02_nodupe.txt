Praying this gets fixed soon
---
---
---
Ascended trinkets are much easier now that S3 ones can have all stats. Run some alts through BFF and Dragonfall and I can get a full set every couple of days.
---
Im not sure about LS3, but Kourna/Dragonfall dont have fixed timer for Meta, usually timer countdown start after last meta on those maps, like Silverwastes.
---
Those metas aren't on timers. Only the metas that are on a timed schedule are displayed on the timer page.
---
I actually only started on Aurora because I wanted that converter, which unlocked it, and because I got an achievement in a subcollection for unlocking Henge for cosmetic reasons.
---
To be honest, it's more of a comfort thing. It used to be a nice filler when I was using a condition engineer build, and it sort of stuck.
---

---
I think that grenades are great for encounters that require range attacks, or where you need to swap between melee and range. The sword/shield engineer really doesn't have much range besides photon forge 4.

A march in an MMO will always have something a real life march doesn't

I started both. Tbh I only want the moon-y effect of the trinkets (one of them) so if I can go for one that's easier I'll do it. Tips?
---
I'd been hoarding them, yes, but I didn't know what to use em for. TY!
---
Love the new layout. Now just need to get the updates times setup in Taco.
---
Lol, because there aren't a decent number of sites where you can see deleted and removed comments ... 
---
PM me if you really think the mods are evil and I'll show you the onslaught of bigotry they're having to remove.
---
High five! One of my favorite things about the event is seeing the diversity within our community!
---
I wish we could be "ugly" legendaries in the cash shop.  No fancy skins, but with stat switching.
---
As owner of a full home instance...
---
First I got enough to be able to do the "&lt;region&gt; &lt;gatherer&gt;" dailies done without hunting all over.
---
Then the LS3 (and later LS4) nodes came out. While the daily thing is still there, I now view the larger value is being able to semi-passively accrue all of the map currencies slowly over time. Need Viper's jewelry? no prob. Suddenly need a stack of each LS4 currency, because DRAGON! ? only had to farm about ~50 items total.
---
There's some other things I pick up along the way, like aurillium, bloodstone/empyreal/dragonite, unbound/volitile magic, baubles, etc. None of them are a fast progression, but I steadily gain supply of all of them, without having to explicity farm them separately. 
---
As such, I view them as a "currency conversion" tool.
---
But making money off them is a very very long term investment. I routinely take my 4 alt accounts along for the farm, and even at 5x pay back, it still would take hundreds of farm days to break even.
---
Yeah, i know that feeling. I couldn't control myself when i got a Vial of liquid aurillium (2000 golds) from the meta, in Auric Bassin. But i never got a Pre, lol
---
But anyway, congrats, don't spend your gold too quickly üëç
---
I just want to play basket brawl.
---
Any other letters you wanna add to the slew?
---
Yes, the most interesting one for me too and by far.  I don't join guilds easily (very selective), but that would be one I'd be interested in learning about more (though, of course, they wouldn't want me as whatever gold I have is a but very unseen tiny, tiny fraction of what he and his guild deal with regularly).  
---
But besides all that, he seems someone who is pretty kind and a good person.  And those people are the ones I find rare and valuable.  That he does so much sponsoring and so much is really wonderful of him.  
---
Thank you, Noodica for telling us about him.
---
Get your Bifrosts ready! :D
---
Hey, not all of us agree with this, but whatever floats your boat..

There is a big difference between fighting cancer and celebrating a behavior that is contrary to natural law.

Click wheel in upper right side of inventory. There are few settings, including showing/hiding bags.

Has anyone tried to do a cosplay of ultra instinct Goku with this aura ?
---
Bunny still has top damage too doesnt it?
---
i had several screenshots where braham does the same thing, especially weird when the story is finished and you're talking to him and others
---
Tbh, that would be hilarious.
---
Whoever downvoted this as soon as i posted it doesn't get to stand in the bubble
---
Oh fuck off.
---
So is it worth opening unindentified gear after all?
---
If you want a chance to upgrade the rarity, yes.
---
What a stretch. Are your hips ok?
---
yeah, no.
---
I was refering to the person's use of slurs in that post.
---
Money's study is well known and also notorious in the trans community - I'm also quite familiar with it cause I studied higher level psychology with a focus on abnormal psychology in the IB for 2 years, and Money's study was one of the studies we focused on.
---
As you put it quite nicely, his studies were unscientific, and if anything, prove the point quite well that you shouldn't force someone who doesn't feel like they belong to a particular gender to act in a way that conforms to it just because you think that's what's best for them, supported by the shockingly high numbers of suicide attempts amongst trans kids.
---
I was there dyed the same!!! Keep an eye out for me next time, my name is Catherine!
---
I recall Griffon being top, though that was a long time ago I learned that
---
Since homosexual behaviour has been observed in over 500 animal species, I'm not quite sure what behaviour you're talking about... online gaming, maybe? That's never been observed in nature.
---
I dunno, I still prefer springer for jumping up high, if you ever bothered to learn how the mount handles, you can make some really precision landings. I think part of the problem is that people don‚Äôt care to learn how each mount handles, they like the animations but they wish that the mounts themselves would handle as lifelessly as WoW or FFXIV mounts. Each beast is different fundamentally in GW2
---
That said, the Skyscale and the griffon essentially make all other mounts obsolete for most purposes if you like simplicity in mount selection. They are prestige mounts after all though, there‚Äôs a reason they make you jump through hoops to get them. They‚Äôre a status symbol and an ultimate convenience. That‚Äôs why you see so many skyscales floating AFK in cities, they‚Äôre flexing on noobs. I personally think it‚Äôs a real eyesore and I hope Anet does something about it or that the next mount comes along soon, because the swarms of skyscales just afk floating look **really** bad.
---
As far as my top used mounts personally go:
---
Griffon: General purpose, too used mount.
---
Skyscale: for when I need to gain altitude but then I often dismount and midair mount my griffon for the speed.
---
Skimmer: great for use on water because of the speed boost.
---
Springer for vista jumping during map completion and alt leveling.
---
Roller beetle: for shits and giggles on maps with hills, for those sick jumps.
---
The other mounts are collecting dust which is a shame.
---
Weird how people are downvoting a truthful statement regarding a common programming hurdle.
---
Use the way back machine.
---
I know this isn't *new*, but I've just gotta say, the tiny gradients in dusk/dawn boxes is a great detail and I love it. 
---
The compact redesign is pretty cool, too. :)
---
They do make other mounts obsolete, but I'm okay with it. Its like how getting a legendary weapon removes the need to get more weapons of the same type. It's something to work toward for convenience
---
Mine are gs reaper and axe/pistol mirage. For reaper, I love feeling like I'm hitting things like a tank. My mirage is more like a glass cannon but I always have a button to click. It gets my adrenaline up when I'm attacking a group of enemies and my health is dwindling down but I come out the victor after zipping lightning quick around the screen. Rifle deadeye, while a bit braindead for me, is still fun and my current main however. Though the rotation is boring for me, I'm always moving and dodging and surprisingly rarely being downed.
---
Me too!
---
Yes
---
Feel free to add me to your friends list, Vayne.8569  
---
Give me your name so I can add you and you can whisper me if you have a question.  It's not a perfect solution but it's better than nothing.
---
When I go north, id might meet with a friend who we both got gwamm together but he never survived the transition to gw2. Since getting into dnd, I hope these posts keep comin.
---
If you are level 60, go to sparkfly fen and do all the hearts until you grab a full set of soldier stats, you will be fine with that for a while. It is power toughness vitality, then wear a staff or scepter
---
Nope, I tried it on a zerk ele and a viper necro, exactly the same numbers. 
---
The burning will probably activate relevant traits and a fire field is self-explanatory, but the damage numbers and burning duration are fixed.
---
Awesome. Thanks. Yeah, I‚Äôm 61. Just saw that zone on the map and I‚Äôm trying to get there now :)
---
Are you selecting the third tab of the [Black Lion Trading Company](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/1/18/Trading_Post_home.jpg) window?
---
I know there is supposed to be a four day block to prevent bots/RMT, but haven't heard others saying it is completely blocked.
---
With the mastery that resets endurance you get four dodges and additional flight juice. Aim the camera up and your Skyscale will beat the bunny up all but the tallest cliffs. 
---
Skyscale is my default mount these days. In a straight speed test, terrestrial mounts may beat it, but when you factor in the fact that skyscale pretty much ignores all terrain, he *seems* faster overall.
---
Love it when two of my favorite things come together.
---
Damn rich people.
---
I think part of my problem is worrying about pricing it right on the TP.  When something is valuable, the TP prices for listing are high.  Then I have someone come by and post below me by a copper and then they get underbid and so on.  So I worry it will never sell especially when the list of people underbidding becomes long.
---
As a result, these days, I list things somewhere in the middle in hopes it will actually sell.  Most times it will.  But even then, I'll get underbid.
---
So, for me, a big part of it is just not knowing where I should place my item to sell.  And this causes profit margins to be very low.
---
buy stuff on your alts that you would have bought anyways then mail the items to your main
---
This won't work, the trading post forces you to buy out the lower priced stock before you could get to your listing.
---
I did this for everything I wanted on my main, now I have most minis and dyes etc so I can't keep doing that, but nice idea
---
You still end up taking the 15% tax too. Imho it's best to buy stuff you want anyways and then mail the items over. Since you would have hit the tax on that too.
---
Because people seem to be comparing both in a vacuum. It‚Äôs like people claiming that Weaver is best dps in raids all over again where people only care about numbers rather than context and application.
---
We have space weapons, space trinkets, space infusions,
---
 so when do we get space armor?
---
Not gonna lie, I love the marionette effect it has. It‚Äôs so mesmerizing just following all the tethers and movement
---
Nifty vids, surprised you havn't listed the folks behind Arc &amp; TACO.
---
Actually, one point people potentially aren't considering is that the bunny has to actually run up to the cliff before it can begin its ascent. The Skyscale can start climbing from 2000 units away. 
---
Not a lot of cliffs directly next to waypoints &lt;.&lt; &gt;.&gt;
---
If they're downvoting gay people it they're already in a bubble, knowwhatimsayin?
---
Imagine all the players who just flat-out ignore this poor kid every time they waypoint to the highjump ranch.
---
Griffon and Warclaw are tied for the best engage damage.
---
Oh hey Quinn
---
Oh. Maybe I‚Äôm just doing it wrong. I‚Äôll check and see next time I log in :)
---
This is exactly right. I didn't max out my home instance for fast profit, but it's been worth it for the time saved on LW materials alone and avoiding farming burnout. I've honestly never run out of blood rubies or winterberries; I can kit out any amount of alts with ascended trinkets after almost no time spent on other maps. And having the UM/VM gathering tools equipped means I don't have to farm specific maps for that, either.
---
Mystic Coins.
---
I‚Äôd almost rather they just give Skimmer an underwater mastery than make a whole new mount...  Although seeing people on their Chonky Birds down there would break some immersion for sure.
---
I'll provide the quickness so you can spam more.
---
And they still don't know how to CC bars.
---
[One example where the skyscale outweighs the springer.](https://youtu.be/39KAE_w7y2E). Now this one is drastic because it‚Äôs basically a huge wall but it really illustrates the skyscale used right.
---
It‚Äôs not a flying mount, nor a glider mount. It‚Äôs a vertical mount. The springer is dependent of ledges big enough to receive it, small bumps on wall surfaces can be unforgiving and it has a max jump heights whatever you do.
---
The skyscale not only have a base flight canopy quite high, but if you‚Äôre next to a wall you get an 1.5 boost, and with boon of vigor that‚Äôs an extra 2.5 unit. And that‚Äôs without finding a ledge midway to recharge.
---
Come out of the closet. It's 2019, you don't have to pretend to not be gay anymore. Homophobia looks bad on you.
---
[Relevant?](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/09/3b/ce/093bcef763bacdcba2f5243d5e304dd0.jpg)
---
Yep i agree too when leveling as core with no expansions. Warrior allows u to keep playing with diff weapons as u pick them up. 
---
And Axe decapitate sounds satisfying as F
---
ah, a fellow magician
---
If you're the homicidal cat that was in AL you've made at least one list.....
---
Are you sure you were not gifted this by a player? The mail never states who gifts ate from.
---
Sometimes using the skyscale instead of the springer is like using the nail removal end of a hammer to take a push pin off of a quark board when you could just use your hands. Yeah, the hammer is the more powerful tool for nail and nail like object removal in every way, but it‚Äôs more efficient to just pull that pin out with your fingers. Get it now?
---
This'll be a nice an easy(ier) way to obtain harriers gear for anyone looking to get some healing gear :D
---
Lol that's not how MMOrpgs work and you know it
---
a couple of weeks ago i did, for buying a bunch of ppl rabbit ears during easter, it was from another player, like yours is. but i never found out who that player was.
---
I first tested it around Caer Shadowfain on individual Risen. They're not immune to it, nor can they cleanse it. Since I also went to Dragonfall, random Branded are on that list as well.
---
Fractional damage is a nope either, since there's simply no floater at all.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's possible that the burn damage *does* get applied but simply lands simultaneously with the power damage, making it look like one big hit. Since I can't see their actual health, and the burning doesn't show up in the combat log, I have no way to properly test it.
---
Remind me please!
---
Reaper is fun, really fun. But, outside of shroud of feels like the slowest attacking class ever.
---
Hmm, like 6 of us all got identical mails at the same time. Can you send multiple messages at the same time with gifts like that?
---
That‚Äôs hyperbolic and extremely disingenuous but ok.
---
No worries, I may ask a guildie tomorrow if there's one who doesn't have theirs yet. If it's indeed bugged, I'd prefer to make it a quality bug report while I'm at it.
---
maybe it was a group of players sending out the mail?
---
I hear you need to be level 60 to unlock that feature, but it always comes with people being annoyed behind you.
---
Joko is pan if his harem in PoF is anything to go by.  And I mean really pan.  There's a Choya in there.
---
i'm obsessed with this
---
Mounts don't use your character stats, so your crit chance doesn't matter.
---
The only exception is the Skyscale's burning, which scales off your condition damage. Which is really weird. I don't understand why they allowed it to scale its damage but nothing else.
---
That is so sick looking! I wonder how we are going to make it. It can‚Äôt just be a bug created effect right? I hope it‚Äôs just a hidden effect that got revealed prematurely xD I love the color and how they float around the player. Thanks so much for sharing this üòÑ
---
Lol yeah that‚Äôs me. Which list?
---
Yes please can someone eli5 to us don‚Äôt get it at all.
---
Oh, yes, you're right! I totally forgot about that.
---
Not really? All of my mounts are mapped to the side buttons on my mouse, which in other games with more cluttered skill bars, would be used for skills anyway. If there‚Äôs a ledge to jump, instinctually I go for my springer, if I need to really need the skyscale specific perks, I hit the button for my skyscale, it just happens that it‚Äôs very rare that I need my skyscale.
---
Why would I hit the skyscale button when the springer will get me where I want to be:  
---
1. Quicker in some instances
---
2. With less hassle in some instances
---
Personally I just feel that the skyscale, while a well rounded mount (as it should be, given it‚Äôs status as a prestige mount.) it‚Äôs also pretty situational. 
---
As I‚Äôve stated, for gliding around, the griffon is way better, so flight isn‚Äôt really a huge selling point for me, I find hovering in place pointless as well, people just seem to love to AFK with it, I don‚Äôt tend to afk in non-town zones as a personal preference so hovering doesn‚Äôt particularly appeal to me.
---
Again, this whole time I‚Äôve been talking about my personal presence for mount usage. You seem to be pushing the notion that skyscale is the end all, be all, of mounts out right now, I‚Äôm saying I disagree and I prefer having my selection of mounts for whatever purpose I want to use them for and is it stands, I personally don‚Äôt feel like I even need the skyscale.
---
Could just make a new account, since your friends are starting from scratch and you all plan on buying the expansions anyway. Then, once you get the old account back, switch to it for birthday gift value.
---
What about gold wise? Which one is cheaper. Any approximate for vision?
---
Where'd you get the beta screenshots for Eye of the North?
---
Its a heck of a journey to unlock, especially if you planned poorly like me and ate all my map currencies for volatile magic. I'm sure they'll announce some milestone once its hit.
---
As long as you got an email confirming they received your request, then they will get back to you.  Odds are good that if you recovered your account once you'll be able to do it again, so no need to worry about that.  Apparently lots of people have been recovering accounts lately, so that particular support queue is long.
---
Side note:  I would highly recommend you get password management software, and apply 2-factor authentication to your account if you haven't already.
---
I hope you've learned not to re-use passwords.
---
I'd recommend setting up a new e-mail account as well and only using it for gw2, it sounds like your e-mail/password combination got leaked elsewhere and it's now being used to steal your accounts.
---
Mount handling is a key talking point here though, some people avoid using certain mounds because of how they handle, each mount handles differently from each other. A great example of this is the raptor, for a lot of people the raptor handles really weirdly and they don‚Äôt like it so they opt to drop it in favor of the jackal as soon as they‚Äôre able to. (Before they hav the griffon anyway.) but if you learn how to handle the raptor correctly, it has the potential to be an ideal mount for getting around, even if it isn‚Äôt as fast as the roller beetle, as easy handling as the jackal, or as forgiving of accidental ledge drops as the griffon. The raptor is still a useful mount, it doesn‚Äôt become 100% useless just because you have one of the other mentioned mounts. Some (myself included) still don‚Äôt like how it handles so we don‚Äôt use it very often, and that‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs for that very reason that skyscale is also not a mount that I use very often, I don‚Äôt like the way the mount handles, for most purposes I prefer to use my springer because I‚Äôve ridden it for so long that I‚Äôm pretty adept at riding it, finding jumping paths at a glance that work for me, and making precision landings that get me to where I want to be, helped all the more by the Aurene masteries (being able to jump off of a mount in mid air is a super utility, and combined with the griffon‚Äôs mid-air mount, the potential for really fun ways to travel and mount switch are endless.)
---
So a lot of the points being presented that make the skyscale ‚Äúmount number one.‚Äù don‚Äôt really sway my opinion, as many of the existing mounts and mount masteries have so much to offer, that I‚Äôm not particularly drawn to use a mount that in my personal opinion handles kind of... I dunno how to describe it, boxily? Inorganicallt? I suppose as a lizard based creature would. At least it feels that way after having spent time on a griffon which moves with so much grace.
---
You say you are selling stuff of TP on alt accounts.  Xfer that stuff to main account and sell it on that account. There's no limit for passing loot.
---
In soldier stats he'll just deal 0 damage and lose to anything beyond basic mobs.
---
&gt; Mount handling is a key talking point here though, some people avoid using certain mounds because of how they handle
---
Or because mounts have limitation. It's as if you suggested that people don't like to use the raptor on sulfurous wasteland because they don't "like/know how the mount work" when it's just not made for that type of terrain.
---
Raptor leaps are bad on hills, but leap further on flat terrains. That's where the jackal become useful. Jackal + bound of vigor allow users to spam teleport really fast and far one shot.
---
Each mounts have pro and cons, it's called balance. Not everything is about preference or handling. Which is why I found your implication about "part of the problem being how people handle mount" a bit... misguided?
---
&gt; So a lot of the points being presented that make the skyscale ‚Äúmount number one.‚Äù  don‚Äôt really sway my opinion
---
I never implied the skyscale was mount number one. I don't know where you got that impression from and I'm puzzled you're still debating in that direction.
---
I merely implied the skyscale offered more verticality and landing control at once than the springer. Not talking about the handling here, but numbers, game mechanics and physics. Next to a wall, the skyscale will go higher than the springer, which is dependent of numerous medium/big ledges. On landing, the skyscale work as an helicopter whereas the springer is a falling rock victim of gravity. The former will obviously offer more precision.
---
The springer go high fast, but fall as fast. The skycale's more precise controls come at the cost of speed.
---
Game balance.
---
&gt; but if you learn how to handle the raptor correctly, it has the potential to be an ideal mount for getting around
---
See it's a bit ironic that the crux of your argument seems to be about "learning to handle" yet you were quick to dismiss the skyscale instead of learning to use it.
---
Congratulations!
---
Does it? It didn't seem impacted whatsoever when I tried it on viper necro. Same power damage so I expected a considerable boost in total damage, but it didn't look that way.
---
Also Warclaw crits for *considerably* more.  Both it and Raptor had both like 3311 damage or so listed. Raptor gave me like 4,5k crits on random risen, Warclaw got consistently like twice that number. It once even broke 10k!
---
Not sure if it entirely aligns with crit damage %, but there's certainly something more going on in that calculation.
---
Waiting on the Facet event... I happen upon this and tear up a bit.  
---
I love the song, and this was very well done!
---
No.
---
Aurora + Vision + ??? (On Mesmer clones)
---
Vision + Aurora + unknown third effect that can be seen on Mesmer clones, which is currently bugged to "upgrade" the effect by 1. It is likely Coalescence.
---
This one can be a bit tricky to get down. You're supposed to only deal damage to it for a bit after you CC it fast. Then wait for his breakbar to be up again and repeat.
---
I just hate getting a class that turns out the be completely shit when it comes to the end game and wasting all that time and slot. I do have interested in ranger though.
---
Thief is good for everything. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
---
Is power and/or condi Berserker good for open world now with the changes? I read that it was bad before. Just wondering :)
---
Is one better than the other?
---
Ok thanks. I'll give that a try
---
So we're using "cishet" as a derogatory label against straight, cisgendered people now? Because it looks like you just used it that way.
---
How fast? Roughly speaking how many play-time hours/days did it take you?
---
I'm talking about the guy bitching at you for daring to take a picture with the phone. Advice returned.
---
 Wife here, Sorry you're so bent out of shape about him giving me credit for the thing **I** found? Get over yourself, man.
---
(Deleted my old comment on a new account because I was able to get back into this one.)
---
I am bored because leveling is boring. That's how it was in every MMO I have ever played. In GW2 it's ESPECIALLY boring because the mobs are especially unchallenging. Other than that, I like the game and I like its aesthetic. I enjoy it. I just don't enjoy the mindless labor of leveling up. I think a game is so much more than the leveling up phase.
---
&gt; ECT
---
 Electroconvulsive Therapy? European Central Time?
---
Do we need to talk about the "gay only" too? I'm gay myself and let me tell you : this is the best way to make people angry at you for being an asshole.
---
There is no class that is completely shit at anything.
---
Hey, There's me!! (Waving in the background, with the character that looks like a tool)
---
I'm looking to get into the game. I've been around the MMO block quite a lot, so there's only a few key questions.
---
1. How much content is lost to me if I play now? I grew sick of WoW and its content high-pressure tactics, and I quit that game hard when they started removing entire questlines as part of their time-exclusive content. I don't like getting into an MMO that has had thousands of things rendered inaccessible, such as quests, cosmetics, achievements, story-content, dungeons/raids, etc.
---
2. How involved is the cash shop, ultimately? I like a good, lengthy leveling process that feels rewarding; I don't want to watch someone slap down the cash, quaff a potion and hit max level and buy out a full set of splendid gear in the span of 20 minutes, making my 50~ hours look ridiculous.
---
3. I intend to solo, or play with a single friend for most of the time. Can I do most of the game this way? I imagine the truly end game PVE stuff is out of the question, but I'm curious.
---
Thanks in advance.
---
Lol my bad, thanks for catching that.
---
I‚Äôm sorry. I honestly considered that, but on my end it looked like you had replied to my comment, making me think that you didn‚Äôt. Sry rip
---
I have heard alot of shit about revenant tho. Only class I have heard alot of hate about currently.
---
I kinda like these things, when they're proper mechanics at least. Like the doppelganger hunting a player, or scarlet doing the same way back when. it's a nice change of pace from fixed spawnpoints etc. personally I'd prefer it if they did stuff like that more often, on maps with special tools, so the targeted player could run to a location with lots of siege, or where some NPC's are that provide boons or to a corridor with traps where the mobs have to stack and could easier be aoed and so on. could be a fun way to mix things up a bit.
---
non gays are always welcome im was being facicious(i dont know how to spell that word)
---
allies are honorary gays dw i shall always welcome them
---
If this is how you actually conduct yourself, maybe you *should* be told to sit down. I'd say that clearly your parents were wolves if they taught you treating people like this was okay, but that would be an insult against wolves.
---
The guy apologized, but that's not good enough for you. He didn't mean any harm, but you don't give a shit. As far as I can tell, you won't be satisfied until he quite literally slits his own throat IRL and dies for his perceived crimes.
---
My all-time favorite event timer :-)
---
As a rev main,I can assure you rev can do Support and Dps really well,and it‚Äôs a part of the meta.
---
The only thing I heard about ppl hating on rev is that it‚Äôs elite spec is pretty much required to played the class well because is so god damn good,but that goes for a lot of other classes too theses days.
---
It's a bit of a shame really.
---
Like many things in GW2, I feel the "had potential" creeping in. Mounts were essentially Metroid-style progression for GW2, an amazing, non-combat-centric, way to make players become "stronger". Open up new avenues of movement.
---
Yet while the Griffon was quite limited until the endurance regen skill came in (and after it was fixed), the Beetle already showed some issues: No longer was the point "Here, you can now get past obstacles of type X" but rather opposite, "Assuming there's no obstacle of type Y around, you can now zoom like crazy". Still, doable. Even just traversal speed for relatively empty areas is a neat upgrade in Metroid games, though GW2 having utterly abandoned teleports of course removes most of the need for it.
---
Now the Skyscale. A mount which becomes a mixture of different mounts conveniently rolled together into a 99,5% superior version, only needing the constituent mounts for a handful of edge case.
---
It's exactly **not** what I had hoped the mount system would end up be, although just from the Griffon and the Beetle it was already clear that it'd end up being this.
---
This is not a gold maker, this is more of a baseline supply for crafting and supplementing your resources. There are far better ways to make money in the game. Research various node runs, check out the taco overlay, and also research flipping on the tp .  Cheers.

1. I hated it too, that's why I stopped playing GW2 back when I did. Season 1 was all temporary content. Some of it has come back in other forms (like fractals). [This guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8wq6aj/play_gw2_in_story_order_guide/) has a good breakdown of where and how to play the parts of the story in order and I have a [brief recap on it here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/Story_Recap) (also a link to the 3 hr "movie" on season 1). So besides that early mistake they have kept access to the full rest of the story and now all the content (festivals obviously rotate but they all come back now). The story in order goes: Personal story (1-80, free base game) &gt; Season 1 (removed, see above) &gt; season 2 (gem store purchasable story or can play with someone that owns it for free, 2 zones added for free) &gt; Heart of Thorns (expansion 1) &gt; Season 3 (gem store purchasable, 6 locked maps, good rewards) &gt; Path of Fire (expansion 2) &gt; Season 4 (gem store purchasable, logging in now unlocks episode 6 for free).
---
2. Leveling in Gw2 isn't really a thing a prestige. There are in game scrolls (you get a ton for doing WvW and PvP) that give characters levels, there are boosters, there are scrolls you get as birthday gifts, you get exp from everything... There are many hard to get items, challenges, achievements, legendaries , etc but leveling to 80 is not special. If you know what you're doing it takes you a couple days or if you really want to rush it ~4hrs. But these are all good things since GW2 is very alt friendly and really does expect you to have many characters (I think I'm at 14 now?). Oh and while the cash shop is not P2W at all it does have level boosts (boost to 80) and some convenience items in it but is mostly cosmetic. Also both expansions come with a level 80 boost.
---
3. Full story, open world, etc is all fine. If you're good you can even solo/duo most dungeons but yes, realistically you're not going to be doing very high end fractals or raids solo.
---
Firebrand + Scourge is extremely effective and pretty easy to play
---
Lots of the good meta rewards are locked to once per day per account (like the key pieces). You can check the wiki for the specific meta though.
---
3 sounds good and I can deal with 2's answer. I'm curious about this Season 1 thing, though. Are they intending on returning the stuff via other methods, since it seems they returned some of it? And was that the only real example of it? What is exactly the temporary content? It sounds like gear.
---
I need proof this wasn't a pic taken from outside your neighbors window. J/k GRATZ!
---
Haha thank you for the encouragement. 
---
As with most people I would prefer to work with no expectations I will mostly just do more if I have inspiration on something unique.
---
If I do manage to finish more subclasses I may post this growing pdf on DMs Guild where you could pay what you want to get the pdf. And I do enjoy the formatting as 90% of the inspiration comes from the images.
---
1) LS1 (the first post-core game story arc) was temporary content: its AP and events are gone forever from the game. The rest of the game is available if you purchase/grind it out (can't grind for expacs, but.) Everything else is open to you trying it. You'll have to put in some time if you want to get up to spec on raids, or fractal CMs, but I think you should be able to access the great majority of the game fairly easily.
---
2) Cash shop is convenience and cosmetics: you can buy conveniences like shared inventory, etc, but level boosters are rare, gear from the cash shop involves converting gems &gt; gold to help you grind it out/you'll still have to get around mats timegates, etc. Most people I know get buy on mostly in game farming, which is even easier now that the more expacs you own, the more stats you have accessible to you on stat selectable items (which you can earn through LS content, PVP, wvw and some open world stuff). This is true for the US/EU version, mind: the Chinese publisher has kind of made gearing a joke, but.
---
3)  Possible, except for raids, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend doing dungeons or fracs beyond t1 that way. But definitely true for a lot of the game.
---

---
State your source(s). I have all classes and their elite specs and Rev is DEFINITELY useful.
---
That‚Äôs very much not true. Plenty of classes are shit in certain modes.
---
Nice censorship.
---
Have someone queue you into a game, and play through.  I had the bug and cancelled after the screen went away before I joined the game, and when I zoned into WvW for reset night it was back..2 hours of LEGACY OF THE FOEFIRE plastered across my screen and it just disappeared.
---
Lol. Trailblazer thieves in groups of 10, spam shortbow 4.
---
i guess quickbrand+alacrene is still stronger for dungeons but boon chrono is still got esp. for these dungeons you need his unique utility for speed clearing (xera portal removed this need much tho)
---
Wouldn't that just be a repeat of first video 5 mins of Sacrx and Red Guard?.
---
Anywhere you have groups of players fighting a boss, Boon Chrono can be helpful. I love fighting Chak Gerent in Tangled Depths and seeing Alacrity and Quickness on my buff bar. In dungeons, similar to fractals, Chrono brings lots of utility. Focus pulls on clumps of enemies, stealth or portals to skip past annoying stretches, or plenty of CC for pesky breakbars.
---
That said, as a Chrono you‚Äôre gonna want to change your skills, weapons and some of your traits per encounter. You can try running a single cookie cutter build and do okay in a lot of situations, but if you want to be more effective you‚Äôll want to make changes from time to time.
---
It's ok in a multimap meteor farming squad. Just switch off your brain and play some music.
---
Yeah don't go for soldier stats, you'll have zero damage left and almost everything will kill you before you kill them. Minmaxing isn't needed in open world, like, at all. But it's still pve, so without your own damage, you'll end up quite useless.
---
If you want to prioritise, berserker's and assassin's are great prefixes. Valkyrie gear will be your best alternative to add some extra health if you prefer that for now, but all other stat prefixes are quite worthless for a leveling ele.
---
You get a lot of skills to play around with, and all of them will help you survive in some way or another. You can get defensive weapons, utilities, traits, whatever! Just try to avoid defensive stats.
---
People have spent more for less.
---
*couhminiscough* What‚Äôs the issue?
---
in dungeons you will often play with people that cannot utilize the boons you give them, essentially wasting them (and the investment in lost DPS you made for them). more often than not you'll see groups with 1-2 players doing 80% or more of all damage. while supporting those players would help, if you're already one of them, you're better of with a self reliant spec that provides its own boons. power reaper may not be meta in good groups, but if half your group don't really do much, the self might and quickness make sure you can do solid dps even when nobody provides boons.
---
for open world it's similar. if you ever activate arc on a worldboss you'll see a small number of players doing almost all damage, while the rest do a 10th to a 5th if that. if you could prioritize your boons on the stronger players it would be amazing, but usually it's just wasted effort. 
---
if you ever have a group of meta players doing open world stuff, it's quite eye-opening. a while ago deroir did a bounty run with viewers (who tend to be a bit more into the meta I'd say) and setup the squad with subgroups with chronos etc, and all bounties just melted insanely fast. the overhead of loweffort autoattacking players you normally get through lfg slows everything down to a slog and providing boons to them unfortunately doesn't make much of a difference - even if you double someones DPS from 2 to 4k, you could still gain more by simply going all out on personal dps.
---
so is it worth it? probably not. but it also doesn't hurt. and in dungeons the utility will be useful even if the other players don't make use of the boons. so just go for it :)
---

---
Because they did, because they're a hypocrite.
---
It's the name of an ascended one already
---
Bots would still abuse that.
---
There‚Äôs boon/heal thief and I guess condi engi is still viable,the rotation is just too unrewarding for anyone to play it.
---
which power chrono build has a lot of blocks and evades again?
---
&gt;Will i be able to carry bad pugs in dungeon with Boons or should i switch build/character for dungeons ?
---
With chrono you can carry pugs in dungeons for sure, not because you're playing chrono but because you're playing mesmer.
---
Portal, mass invisibility, feedback, focus4, time warp and other utilities like the stability mantra can help a lot in dungeons, and to a lesser degree open world. Sure, double time warp/mass invis with continuum split is great but i would not recommend running a boon chrono.
---
It is fine to play a diviner/berserker/assassin boon chrono in open world meta events like chak gerent and octovine although quickbrand probably outperforms boon chrono there. Your quickness is only 5man and you don't bring alacrity but you have a much easier access to other utilities like aegis and stability.
---
I would say, in open world and dungeons, play power chrono instead. You have some self quickness from the illusions traitline and some minor alacrity from chronomancer. You deal like 5x the dps and still have access to mesmer utilities.
---
Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è

/u/tgdm between day 1, 2 and 3 i hadnt had to wait until reset between each. i finished day 1 (6 more eggs left of that quest) 1 hour after reset teq fight and thought i had to wait  23 hours i logged off, 8 hours later logged back in to see what else i could do and i had the email to go to suns refuge, where i started the skyscale of earth/air/water.... immediately. i finished those, logged off for 3 hours, logged in and got the day 3 care quests. from what i understand from the may 28th patch, i only have to wait 2 hours between every 4 feeds now.
---
maybe you could update your guide?
---
Screw the better way, I want to go up *here*!
---
Thanks
---
Boon Chrono is dead as a carry. You'll never get them to stand in your bloody wells, and you can't just spread your boons on their faces despite their best attempts to avoid it like the devil avoids holy water.
---
Boon Chrono shines in organized groups whose members aren't overtaxed with the concept of 'stand in the pretty purple circles', everywhere else their raging incompetence makes it impossible for you to help them.
---
thanks for the answer
---
More fun than parading around bringing dumb problems in a game where they don t belong in.
---
No one removes them in game-related threads. In game-related subbreddit.
---
Somehow people can live with that. But not here.
---
This game has openly queer characters, you moron.
---
LGBT people exist IRL and are occasionally shown in media, you can't change that no matter how much you wish to. Sorry you're so hateful, but know that the majority of civilized society is against you and your hate comments. Stay trash.
---
Blocked, ignorant.
---
Exactly the point, 'moron'. March in a game that refuses to acknowledge LGBT.
---
What are you talking about?
---
Guild Wars 2 is a GAME. There are hateful comments being removed in this thread ABOUT GW2. Can you at least try to sound literate before replying to me?
---
Why are you trying to claim /r/guildwars2 isn't a "game-related subbreddit"? Are you senile?
---
Ya, I'm really happy with the way they have done the content in seasons 3 and 4 especially. Solved all my issues with it and if you're around when they release you get them for free. Only minor down side is new players need to purchase the seasons to play the full story but you can spend in game currency on them if you're so inclined.
---
Pro Tip: If you don¬¥t like the look of something, don¬¥t get it. Legendaries are not a must have.
---
you're primarily arguing about a slight speed advantage right now. unlike the raptor/jackal debate, where it's not just about speed but actual capabilities. a raptor can never make a 90¬∞ turn midair, and a jackal can never precisely land on a small space unless it already starts at a perfect distance. these things mutually exclude the other mount for certain situations, while the skyscale is never in a situation where springer is necessary, at best it's a bit faster.
---
as for the actual speed, I agree springer can be faster in some situations, but some of your assumptions are incomplete:
---
skyscale regens altitude for a bit even after liftoff (basically, the GUI lags a bit behind), so you only have to touchdown for about a second on ground and can fly up again with full juice.
---
as for the base speed advantage, the skyscale can both climb and traverse distance at the same time, while the springer first has to traverse, then jump straight up, having to travel a further distance overall, so I think overall it cancels out, though I'm sure it depends a bit on walk distance and height to overcome and I'm pretty sure either can win in certain situations, like for long-ish walk distances with a small jump at the end skyscale can use ability 1 to both climb and travel much faster than springer. could be an interesting experiment to calculate the slope at which this changes.
---
Going back over this thread to bask in the chaos and 100% agree. He's the reason *you do not* transmute caladbolg.
---
I really want legendary trinkets without skins, so I can stat swap.
---
Then report my comments to the mods you whiner. You can't have it both ways. 
---
Get over yourself. The mods choose what they want to remove. If they want to remove mine, I don't really care. I have other comments in this thread which are highly educational and don't contain insults. In the meantime I suggest you actually READ the comments that were removed and decide whether it's actually ''''censorship'''' or if the mods were justified in deleting them.
---
Learn to read or don't @ me again.
---
it's just that nobody cares about you or what you think
---
I think there's a broad gap between pansexuality and a depraved revenant who keeps sex slaves. It's note exactly representation.
---
I mean, he could be both, though.
---
It would be neat if you could collapse each section. for example I have just down the HoT Metas, so now wanna do the PoF ones, when i scroll down to the bottom I cant see times, so if i could collapse ones i needed the area woukld be smaller and i should still be able to see times.
---
Either that freeze top row of times so its always viewed
---
Chest from treasure hunting kit still clunky. Picking up tresure still dismount you.  And some chest spawn point are obvious death trap.
---
Elegy mosaic drop rate is like 1 in 10 superior chest.
---
So unless you have stealth build dont bother doing them.
---
That's actually not completely true, I can spot 4 or 5 comments of people simply stating their opinion in removeddit.
---
and for a price less than a full legendary weapon. right now, if you don't care about the skin, it's way better to just use ls3 trinkets and craft another weapon for statswapping.
---
I think armour had the perfect price, and the 6 trinkets together should be about the same, not several times more expensive for less stats.
---
either way, we need legendaries without skins (like a cheaper recraft after we got one already), I mostly care about the functionality, not the skins.
---
Also "Look at this beautiful chest armour! When you equip it on female characters, you mysteriously lose half the fabric!"
---
Even the new dragonfall heavy set has random cut-outs. Light legendary armour too, I just wish we had the option to equip either gender's version.
---
already posted on reddit.
---
The actual rewards themself are nearly the same with the exception of the hero's choice chests and additional elegy mosaics. The most "rewarding" factor is that you know now when an event begins so you are cutting down the waiting time quite significantly and therefore you will get overall more rewards. To be honest those metas where never truely bad in the first place but simply not farmable because of missing timers. If you wanna maximizing your loot hot metas are still your way to go. They will rewards you with much more drops in total but are longer, more layered and requiere keys.
---
Can you please be more exact next time you push a list of countries like that? I am from one of those countries and saying that "In several of these countries you'll get stoned to death" basically sounds like it's the case on most of them, which I'm pretty sure isn't true.
---
So next time, simply split the countries which stone people to death and those who don't, because what you are doing is actually quite racist.
---
I'm definitely planning on adding the authentication to my gw account once I get it back!
---
Password management software? How does this work?
---
Most LW maps are dead and I assume once the majority of people get past their needs for Vision the maps will become deserted again. I had an interest in Astral weapons, but in all the months since I started playing I have never seen anyone try to harvest meteors until Vision. It's a miserable prospect, no one is around to help clear the meteor site OR buff the yield, so you might get 10 rose quartz per fall. It's absurd.
---
The motivation for me to craft legendaries for me always been stat-swapping. I use around 7 builds with my toon (thank god arcdps build templates). What that means is that I have to carry various foods, sieges&amp;traps for wvw as well as various weapons.  I lack of inventory space even though I already maxed out bag slots. That's why I've decided to craft Vision, to easy up my inventory&amp;convenience.
---
I've already crafted Vision. After crafting Vision, I realized how bad it looks on my toon, since it doesn't match my toon's color theme&amp;style. And I can't even turn it off. I tried using various dyes on armors, but it just doesn't match. It's  11th legendaries that I've crafted, and it's the first one that I didn't feel like something I've accomplished. It rather felt demoralizing. 
---
I have nothing against achievements and cost that I need for crafting it. But after crafting it and seeing how it looks on my toon, I was so disappointed that I didn't have the will to log in for a bit. Now I just kill myself, using bug to get rid off the vision appearance.
---
Yeah the email address used for gw2 is an older email i use for spam and junk nowadays.
---
I hope to change it over to my current email once I get my password reset!
---
What is that 3rd aura effect of trinket?
---
The cracking point is the not being able to hide it. Imagine you want to buy a car but the only option is a Fiat Multipla.
---
I apologise; I was overgeneralising because I was pissed off.
---
Jackal and raptor were relatively equal before they added more mount masteries. Right now jackal is fully superior to raptor because it scales better both with vigor (it can do a really long sequence of controlled blinks, without losing much attitude even, making it the fastest mount for crafting station-bank kind of trips) and with jump (it can be used midblink for a really powerful leap). Also portals.
---
Springer vs skyscale is ineeded similar in that regard, with skyscale being superior due to better scaling with masteries, better short ter speed and control. And also springer being straight out unable to get somewhere without  convinient ledges.
---
&gt;Now the Skyscale. A mount which becomes a mixture of different mounts conveniently rolled together into a 99,5% superior version, only needing the constituent mounts for a handful of edge case.
---
If anything this is the other way around. The skyscale is better in a handful of cases but the springer is much faster at climbing and the griffon is a much faster flyer.
---
It seems a bit outdated in todays day and age. With current technology I can walk into TARGET, blink at the customer service rep, and he or she will be able to tell me everything ive ever purchased, the color of my underwear, and what I ate the night before.
---
Watch your step, 80% of all Tour-related injuries occur there.
---
There is so much wrong with you tbh.
---
&gt;by showing that they're normal 
---
Yes we are. Sorry you disagree. Nothing in OP's post implied that LGBT people are abnormal in any way.
---
&gt;sex crazed nudists that are ready to run naked in public places
---
Oh so you're already starting with the stereotypes. Also I don't see OP or anyone in this thread advocating to run naked through the streets or anything? Talk to any random gay off the street and ask them if they're comfortable with that. I know my community isn't. 
---
&gt;1k$ target
---
So your complaint about the fundraiser is that............... the initial target isn't high enough??? You know homophobia still exists and is very prevalent, right? Bigots won't donate to an initiative for gay people. You're literally complaining that we didn't ask for enough. It's a fundraiser, the more $ it gets, the better. 
---
Furthermore, it's not even one of the mainstream LGBT charities. It's a TYRIAN fundrasier. Aka the majority of people donating are from the GW2 playerbase. So obviously there would be less people donating than if it were a big-name global thing. Use your brain ffs.
---
&gt;people not wanting to help others but really mainly wanting to celebrate themselves
---
Newsflash: people can do both at the same time.
---
&gt;people are trying to push for more and more
---
Such as being equal to straight people. Sooooo demanding right?
---
&gt;like not having to see people walking around naked, or people having sexual activity in public places
---
Again, no actual gay person fucking advocates for this. Please go outside and stop believing everything you read on 4chan.
---
Ultimately, you aren't doing anything besides mouthing off to people who are doing way more than you. So just shut up. :)
---
So you want the story to play... how... exactly?
---
Walk in, hit once, be done?
---
I can think of a perfect story arc for you. It's season 1, here you don't get to fight annoying mobs, you don't get to deal with mechanics, you will never die, you don't need friends to play with, you don't have to worry about map events. All you have to do is click on play and watch.
---
yeah, inventory space is a total hassle right now. legendary armour is amazing to reduce the clutter, and if I could craft skinless trinkets I'd probably do so despite the cost. I instantly overwrote my legendary armour on my mesmer with the vigil skins because I like the simplistic look that doesn't hide animations etc, aurora/vision are just visual bloat I really don't want to see (and wish I could turn off for other characters in raids as well).
---
I think if yur the sort of person who rushes chapters and skip dialouges, yu will ***NEVER*** enjoy Living World, or Personal Story for any expansion ever.
---
A huge amount of the story is told through dialouge and character interaction, even if the combat parts are kinda wonky (examples being Branded bosses/mobs in general from the beginning of Season 4, Personal Story Risen bosses, and some Season 2 bosses) 
---
But these aren't things we can't beat, it just takes some time, and it's easier for some builds than others, that's why as Living World progresses, yu find that yur NPC partners are hella tanky and never really die, compared to Vanilla Gw2 Dungeon story instances where NPCs are made of sponges, hit like sponges, and basically die to Elite enemies and then leave yu to solo the rest.
---
I'm kinda glad Anet did that, because DPS classes suffered alot from no self sustain and weak defensive capabilities in earlier stories and needing to kite the mobs around after NPC died.
---
It‚Äôs understandable if you don‚Äôt enjoy it, at least you have giving it a fair try,
---
For me personally I enjoy these story missions and more so trying to get the achievements doing so, I‚Äôm the kinda person who would play the living story on my alts and help my friends or guild mates who have some issues with it. With all the mechanics it feels like a solo mini raid to me.
---
The more I do them the more easier they become, and it‚Äôs funny when I find a new way or discover something that would make it even easier. As I tend to experience it on my own and a life guides ^^
---
I like the fact every story has its unique take, there are some I did not enjoy but did it anyway since the overall experience was worth it.
---
Difficulty wise, it‚Äôs an escalation from base story and I enjoy it.
---
Games in general are subjective in my opinion, my guess if you find the perfect class for you with the right build you might enjoy it, since you did try as I mentioned before.
---
&gt;they can drop ? i thought they are gem-store only lol
---
I understand people like the shiny stuff but there is not one single NPC that I can think of that runs around like a lava lamp. IMHO the players do not fit in the rest of the world and that gets out of hand more and more. I would really prefer more done to earth skins in the future.
---
I assuming at some point they'll boost jeweler crafting to 500 and add recipes for legendary trinkets with no effects. fingers crossed anyway.
---
Elite Tauren Chieftain.
---
It‚Äôs a crossover episode.
---
theyre only 250gems for a single use https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Self-Style_Hair_Kit
---
&gt; Bosses that have way too much hp and take way too little damage
---
Use more skills than 1,1,1,1,1,1 while having rare level gear.
---
Idk about the rest, but at this stage boon chrono is druid levels of easy to play. And no you wont be able to"carry" as much as you think due to chaos being nerfed. Then again ccing and portaling is a carry too.
---
If op would tryhard he would not have this problem tho. If you go in with meta dps classes you burn through the enemy hp so fast many times you don't even need to worry about the encounter mechanics, either because the enemy is dead or it reached an hp treashold and switched phase. Op complain that it takes too much time and that it's anoying to solo, if he would tryhard it would not take time nor be a pain to solo.
---
I'll be there if I can Lelling üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
---
I'd love an option to craft some cheaper and plain looking (mithril sword plain) legendary gear for the stat swapping functionality
---
I've had about five or so from random drops. Sadly, the best I've ever got from one was a glider skin and a hair changer kit.
---
I think you are comparing Apples with peaches here. Skins and effects are two different things. Though, I understand what you are trying to say.
---
IMO effects should be part of the wardrobe system! If that is the case anyone can choose which effect can be applied. I would love to use Nightfury on my Necro but then I have a neck like a giraffe on my Asura which I rather want to have the Scarf. You could even add infusions to it which the player then can unlock and apply just like the skins. But this brings other problems with it. How many effects will you allow to be applied? I don't think that many would be happy if you would just allow one infusion effect because they might like the stacked ghostly infusion. Would you increase the intensity of the infusion to compensate this but what about players who like the subtlety of it? Have an intensity slider?
---
That would bring a lot of flavour to fashion wars.

---
&gt; Legendaries are not a must have.
---
All legendaries besides Aurora can be transmuted though.
---
If you want legendary trinkets you have currently no alternative than to look like this.
---
I'm pretty sure they reference "any sane person" by "we" because any sane person wouldn't really think calling someone a bigot for saying "plz no" is justifiable. 
---
Also I don't agree with this part:
---
&gt;this is all we can get from this event,offended and insulted.
---
Just as much as you do but:
---
&gt;but I'm pretty sure that I don't care one bit what 'you' get from such an event
---
This is really unnecessarily aggressive, you could have simply said "oh but this is a movement about being able to love everyone, did you really think you were going to get insulted in it?".
---
&gt;just be ourselves =)
---
And by adding this you basically just said that you are representing "your" community with your unnecessary edginess and aggressivity, which I don't think everyone would agree on, since you ignored the concerns that the person had that they would be insulted in the event, then insulted them, and then proceeded to say that you're going to "be yourselves" without shaking off the aggressive first impression that you just gave.
---
I believe the LGBT movement is about love and positivity and I hope that everyone will see that you are representing nobody but yourself, otherwise you might be damaging your movement and discrediting it.
---
[My suggestions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#WvW_2) are up to date for it.

Myeah, not to live up to our stereotypes or anything, but LGBT guilds can get very Real Housewives sometimes :P Some of the guilds that helped out with Tyria Pride have had changes in leadership or people going "Oh, X wont be helping us this year, we're not on good terms anymore" and then X comes around with their own LGBT guild. But, to be fair, I've seen the same in the "Slovenian" or "Ex-Yu" guilds.
---
My personal guild ideology is in general that guilds should to fill a specific in-game purpose or goal, otherwise there'll always be drama and disagreements on how things should be run and what should go on in the guild :P
---
I always preferred being (and nowadays, running) LGBT-*friendly* guilds that had some kind of other specific in-game aim. That being said, we might make a Tyria Pride guild for people to be able to keep in touch with next year's Tyria Pride better, if people are interested.
---
There is plenty of plain looking weapon and armor skins in the game with [gallant set](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gallant_weapon_skins) being my favourite.
---
It depends. If there is a cliff 25m away from me I can *already* start flying up with my skyscale while Bunny requires that you‚Äôre close and have to charge the jump. It also not as effective as multiple smaller cliffs while skyscale can fly multiple ones at the same go.
---
I'd love t2 version of Dragonfall set but without the crystals.
---
Shouts as utilities, like 'This won't end well!' 'Moving on!' 'Commander to me!'
---
There is a 30% chance of getting one from map completion an any map that's not a city. And a chance of getting one from mobs about as low as getting a pre. I've gotten four as drops in nearly 4k hours. Zero precursors.
---
I manually selected my traits+gear+skills again and then overwrote my old builds. I‚Äôve been able to load from these new overwritten versions fine.
---
you might want to read up on the lore of fractals.

&lt;3
---
Not reading any of that bs since it's obvious you're just here to troll and sealion. Your original comment was already full of misinformation, prejudice and outright logical fallacies.

Didn't we completely destroy his soul with Caladbolg because it was merging with mordremoth? I don't think he passed on into the mists.
---
While I cant help you directly with your problem, you should try using "GW2Launcher" instead of handle.exe.
---
I often run 6-9accounts at the same time with gw2launcher and never have any problems. Even launchbuddy is causing more issues than gw2launcher for me. 
---
If the problems persist, I'd make a fresh gw2 installation.
---
Thank you for raising the issue!
---
I‚Äôm not trying to argue, but it‚Äôs a confirmed aspect that Sylvari do not enter the Mists after death. I‚Äôm not that clued into the fractals, but there seems to be no example of Sylvari in them either. The only Sylvari to enter the Mists is the commander, in POF. Which is already lore confusing. 
---
I would love the idea of Trahearne, but following known lore it‚Äôs not seemingly possible. If you as a Sylvari could channel Trehearne only due to be connected to the dream that would avoid any of the known law behind the Mists and dream.
---
Legendary figures leave an imprint on the mists regardless of their actual connection to the mists I think. The mists are connected to Tyria's past, present and future so everyone and everything is in a way linked to the mists.
---
They were killed in the past. Being left-handed was considered being one with the devil.

You don't need to uncover skin to look sexy.

Just remove the cape so that I can see the butt
---
Queueable 1v1? Nah, you'll find plenty of time/places to get 1v1 duels though, people love that.
---
How thoughtful! Thank you!
---
Lets not forget that Ascended weapons can fill almost any theme/profession while legendary trinkets look nice only on purple/pink characters and/or mesmers (and eventually elementalists).
---
Sure thing!
---
Don't worry about posting, it's very clear that we are working on separate things. Your work being classes and subclasses for 5E and my project being a whole module.
---
I might contact you for either inspiration or to help me with the formatting. I'm fairly adept at designing mechanics and balancing them, but my skills are lacking in formating and making things look pretty.
---
Best of luck in your future projects! :)
---
Can you point out where will he find berserker/assassin gear as free to play level 60? Bear he in mind he can't craft anything since he needs to farm for all mats, neither buy anything from the tp.
---
That would be too easy and without a grind, that's not anet's way.
---
That's the great thing about aesthetics - it's all individual! I happen to think that the "default" ascended weapons are quite attractive, from colour palette to their art style to the animation. On the other hand, I find most of the gen 1 legendaries look like complete trash, and I can't understand why anyone would bother making them. Same with chaos weapons, even back in GW1. If you think an indistinct white glow is aesthetically pleasing in any way... yikes.
---
I wont be doing any legendary trinkets if I cant hide the effects as I know I will get bored of them fast. I dont want to make a legendary , spend lots of gold, and put it in my bank...   
---
Also because of how slow we are getting new legendary trinkets and because of the fact how they work If you make one you will look like anyone other who made one.   
---
There was an episode of Edd Ed and Eddy about this. Something new apeared and everybody needed to get this, and every kid in the neighborhood looked the same, looked like a clown.   
---
https://i.imgur.com/VcEdw9T.jpg   
---
look, everyone have their orbs... ok..
---
Ventari is a centuar, not a Sylvari. Yes he is what influenced them, but he is not one. Just because they follow his tennants doesn't mean they'll be at all the same. Trahearne was a necromancer with a magical greatsword, quite different from a healer. 
---
Pretty sure Balthazar is "an angsty whiner" who couldn't handle being sent to time out. 
---
Trahearne grew out of severe depression due to his being compelled to perform what was regarded as a literally impossible task. He wasn't angsty. He was depressed, but he got through it, though we didn't get much time with him after Orr/Before HoT Due to him cleansing the undead from Orr still while we dealt with other shit. 
---
All that being said, I think reforging the blade was a good way to pay respects. I also could care less about every class using greatsword. And I'd rather see Malyk anyways, even if he's still alive, since time doesn't fucking matter to the mists.
---
True. But I‚Äôm thinking more about the quantity of teeth.
---
Expect them in wvw/pvp.
---
https://www.gw2tp.com/ There are a lot of things that you can craft or refine and sell. Check the https://www.gw2tp.com/ and see what sells now and what you can craft of that. Takes a while to get recipes and materials if you just started but you get the hang of it. 
---
You should probably try and get all crafting professions if you want it to be a incom because they all craft different things which is obvious but for example lately there was a need of a item that you could have earned a lot of gold from if you were a jewler, but this things comes and goes depending on what is asked for right now. Then it was the new mount, now it is probably the new legendary trinket and what is needed for that. Sometimes it is just refined materials and sometimes it is specific that only one of the crafters can do.
---
I saw the deleted comments and its just a bot/troll spam and few people bringing up the "slactivism" and "forcing politics on people" points.
---
I dont enjoy either of them
---
There's many questionable design decisions regarding aesthetics in this game:
---
* No wardrobe for infusions. Multiple infusion-like effects are locked as novelties or shoulder skins. Color-transforming infusions are a wasted opportunity to normalize the infusion system (there could be two different types of infusions, a first set focusing on primary colors you can combine, and another with effects which can be dyed with the first set).
---
* Legendary weapons are terribly hard to mix and match, they should have three color palettes to choose from. For example, Predator has a red version now, give it a blue and green one as well. Exordium has blue/orange colors, give it white and black versions too. Three skins per legendary weapon, unlocked when you craft it. No model changes, just recolors of texture and effects.
---
* Basic mounts can't be properly dyed. Look, I get it, you want to sell mount skins, but if that's so, then just disable dye channels altogether. Basic mounts look ugly as fuck the moment you dye them too differently from the base color. See the roller beetle, default color blue. Dye it red, and half the blue sections will stay blue. Alternatively, you could sell dyeable versions for 50 gold or something like that, just stop with the limiting dye channels, they make your game look like crap, like your artists can't wrap UVs properly.
---
* We really need a "custom outfit" system. One of the biggest selling points of outfits is that you can apply them for free, with just a click. Why can't we have "wardrobe templates" then? Ditch transmutation charges altogether, and start selling wardrobe template slots instead, where people can store their custom outfits. Make it easy to share it among each other as well. This would really incentivize fashion wars among the community.
---
* Swimsuits when? You have people running naked in the ugly default underwear all the time. This kind of customization is top sales in other MMOs, why are you staying away from it? Summer could have an event with swimsuits, water pistols, floats, and all that kind of dumb stuff.
---
* Separate aesthetic slots for mouth, eyes, and head. Some helm would obviously override the three slots, but why can't we combine a hat with some sunglasses and a mask? Maybe make these things part of the facial customization itself. Speaking of which, make facial customization far more accessible. Instead of charging for each customization, charge for each new hairstyle, and then let people use them freely. Don't forget to add beards for sylvari and asura.
---
And I could go on and on, the amount of wasted opportunities is astounding as you see here.
---
&gt;I was referring to the general slew of comments, some written in very long, unformatted paragraphs full of caps, not this person specifically.
---
You said you aren't targeting this person specifically yet you went ahead and searched through their posting history and then attacked them specifically on something buried under 5 pages of comments (according to them) so excuse me if I don't believe that you weren't targeting this person too.
---
&gt;The safe space thing is kind of a joke
---
It might have been a joke but your previous attack and the parent comment calling the person a bigot definitely didn't seem like a joke.
---
&gt; - since, well, I've already said this in my comment but I'll say it again - every time a queer person so much as moves a finger in a gay way, they get hate (sometimes when I post about Tyria Pride, people even find my mail and send me death threats), and then we're meant to be the ones sensitive about other people.
---
I truly most sincerely think that nobody should get personal attacks or harassment let alone death threats but I also feel that you aren't really aware of the fact that what you did is pretty much the same thing. The person really came close to doing nothing but moving their finger in what seemed to you as a homophobic way and you still seem to think it was okay to search through their comments and then praise someone for calling them a bigot, without really knowing jack shit about them. 
---
I think that this whole jumping at eachother's throat game really should come to an end from both parties, we may not be able to reason with the extreme people that go to death threats and spamming Reddit posts but having the public opinion on your side is what really matters now, and you never know if you know how to approach your enemy well you could very well make of them your ally, because a strong conviction needs strong counter convincing, but when it happens the person usually has a feel to compensate for the damage they did, and might become an actually very good ally.
---
&gt;We are literally just walking in a video game, and raising money for a charity that saves people's lives, 
---
The fact that you're trying to do that is great imo, I wouldn't go as far as saying that you are saving people's lives until I actually see proof of it and I don't necessarily agree with the way your funds are spent but wanting to help people in shitty countries is a really awesome thing to do and I wish there was more of that in the world.
---
&gt;and I get death threats for it yearly, and mods have had to remove like half of the comments, because these people can't accept that they share this space with LGBTQ people.
---
Again this sucks, and people being aggressive and attacking/harassing others is definitely something that shouldn't happen, however I believe that people should be able to have different opinions as long as they state them without attacking anyone, which I believe "plz no" wasn't even structured enough to do.
---
Makes no sense to tie LW rewards with raid rewards, each one should be its own thing.
---
Rubies are not *that* bad anymore since they patched it a while ago. But I agree otherwise.
---
How about Balthazar? He also wielded a greatsword.
---
There are a lot of plot holes and inconsistencies with death and the Mists in Guild Wars that will probably never get resolved, but we should assume yes. Especially since we went to the Domain of the Lost in Path of Fire. It‚Äôs possible that it would only be a the Dream or something, though.
---
Like do you realise what you are saying? You want Arena net to collect all your personal info from the internet? And keep track on what ever you do? 
---
I can tell you that this game would die in a day if that happen. Not very long ago there was a question around security and collection personal information from people pc. That simple thing they were said to collect, blew the whole reddit up.
---
I'm left-handed myself, and so are my dad and my grandmother, who were both forced to use their right hands &amp; beaten when they didn't, so I get it - but I also get that **unlike LGBTQ people, left-handed people are not denied access to healthcare, are not shouted at or yelled on the streets, or get sent death threats, and their rights are not restricted compared to the rights of right-handed people.**
---
But I'd definitely love to see the ability to choose whether my character is left-handed or right-handed at character creation, so if you organise a left-handed march, hit me up :P
---
True Tea
---
I am fine with anyone as next legend. All I want is ranged floating greatsword animations. I envy mesmers so much...
---
thank you
---
oh yes please. males in female armor, that would be ao great
---
It wasn't loading skills and traits for a lot of us (if not all) but i've updated it normally and it works just fine.
---
mithrillum and its deldrimor/xunlai stuff might also be good atm due to skyscale
---
For number 4, you don‚Äôt have to be dead to be channeled, the most records history, every time you channel a legend, you are simply just copying the person at whatever point in time you channeled them.
---
What is that third trinket?
---
Is it just me or has the amount of players doing RIBA dropped? Getting pretty hard to find a group that has more than 15 players in it nowadays.
---
Please quote the ToS part u mean!
---
the current boon chrono meta build is pretty dps-y  and there is no real reason to get a separate gear set..especially cuz the extra boon duration will help you personally achieve better dps in lackluster groups
---
speaking of dungeons there are some guilds focused on them and they tend to have competent people..if you pug you can always make a more try-hard lfg to weed out certain individuals
---
also if you play with incompetent people the dungeon won't be long because they do low damage but because they can't do the proper skips which save the most time anyway
---
the other comments are so doom and gloom..guess what? if you buff 10 people with 2k dps into 4k that's 20k dps gain..you lose almost nothing for using timewarp(for example) over gravity well anyway
---
**tl;dr** play smart
---
"Why is our game dying"
---
Hmmm
---
it says "open world activities and etc"... so basically, ni macros are allowed except for dodge jump and music playing, which specifically gave exemptions for.
---
whats the bottom right blue shiny GS?
---
isn't  gw2effiency better for checking crafting?
---
*Shining Blade intensifies*
---
Some people for legendary to get the stat swap. I have my light legendary armor transmuted to sylvari t3.
---
Oh and
---
&gt; "plz no"  
---
You seem very married to this phrase, I saw you used it in a few comments.
---
I wasn't reacting to the plz no at all, I was reacting to their "I play games to get away from real life stuff" which is something a lot of people like to say whenever we do Tyria Pride, but never when we do our multiple sclerosis or cancer fundraisers - when, multiple sclerosis, being an incurable condition, is a much more grim and serious issue that would bring someone down, rather than being LGBTQ+, which can be totally neutral unless other people choose to make it a bad thing.
---
In fact, Tyria Pride is one of the most rambunctious, fun events, and people are giddy and excitable and happy, while during the MS and cancer fundraisers, we share statistics of how many people are affected and everything it does to your body and stuff, which is not really that happy, so if the main reason, the true reason, for why people write "I play games to get away from this", is because they don't want to be faced with real life issues in a video game, then statistically, we should get more messages like that on those events. But we don't, because that's not the true reason, is it.
---
Generally, from years of experience running this event, if anyone writes "I play games to get away from this shit", I'll check their history and 90% of the time (I feel the need to clarify - not a real statistic, but an anecdotal one) I'll find that they have expressed straight up homophobic or transphobic views elsewhere, and they're just trying to sound moderate, while what they really mean is "I don't want this gay shit in my game."
---
AND, I didn't even write a literal accusation like this about that individual person, I literally just plucked something stupid they said out of their post history, and turned the mirror of their comment back on them, in what I thought was going to be an inconsequential but mildly amusing comment, not one that would require essays to understand the meaning of.
---
Or even easier, set up internal timers so that events that start behaving incorrectly get a proper reset. You know, something called exceptions, try, catch, that stuff.
---
If the bug is constantly appearing instead of just a handful of times, then force instant progression.
---
Or double click on scroll wheel for that mystic forge madness
---
Congrats!
---
I wouldn't call killing random groups of annoying mobs that jump you from nowhere and slow you down on your way an *activity*. So by my understanding in that case it is allowed.
---
Keep your ignorance then. And your pointless march.
---
Programming should be mandatory in every school, next to math.
---
Wow, the LGBTQ+ community is so powerful, we kill a game by just walking.
---
name of the set of weaps?
---
Like I mentioned, build template is coming out, you don‚Äôt even need to swap stats, just need a few ascended trinkets to do the job.
---
The skyscale has definitely made me return to older maps just for fun, to see where I can go XD
---
[Weapons of the Scion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Weapons_of_the_Scion)
---
Too bad, [this activity](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Basket_Brawl) was only available for a few weeks, and it has never returned since.
---
&gt; Too slow downwards
---
I'm kinda baffled they didn't enable the "swim down" hotkey for flying downwards.
---
Use wich ever you want.
---
I want a dolyak mount, to do trading like bdoand archeage :P
---
It would be so good in this game too, they could add events to spawn mobs and bosses to pop up to attack you while you are riding on the dolyak.
---
I can hear Thorton's kazoo now. He'll take every spot on the list.
---
I had this issue and solved it by updating the normal arcdps .dll file, not the template one. Guess you've tried it but templates works fine for me so can't really offer any other advice. :/
---
My issue before updating was with skills and traits, gear still worked fine for me.
---
2900 gold gambled
---
4 precursors;

Chaos Gun

np :)
---
So much this
---
Mobs drop crafting materials and unidentified gear (this part was added recently) that you can either salvage into more crafting components or identify into specific pieces of gear. That said, the gear that drops from mobs is almost never good, and you do want  to craft the actually _good_ gear. The gem store is a non-issue.
---
It was an acutal game??? Anet, give me pls.
---
would be cool, along with the oil sucking backpiece you get during the Thunderhead Peaks south meta
---
&gt; I would inform you that being gay isn't a choice
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_lesbianism
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but if I don't buy from tp and dont have any charged quartz previously the grow lamp + skyscale care is going to take me 22 days?
---
I never understood where this greatsword for revenant hype came from. Aside from it just being "cool", it actually doesnt really make sense for the class. Revenant doesnt need another twohanded weapon, it needs more actual main-/off hand weapons to generate more build diversity.
---
Its still faster for any ledges it can actually reach, since it ascends faster than the scale.
---
Open world metas are referring to boss fights with groups, like Chak Gerent or Auric Basin Octovine
---
Of course you would be fine if you just auto attk there but its a huge difference if you actually play effective builds focusing on groups dps.
---
One of the biggest advantage of boon tempest is that his own dps is pretty close to regular dps already while still proving perma 25 might, fury and some other stuff to 10 people.
---
Normally supports are always questionable in open worlds or pugs, since they are pretty worthless if you dont have any player which utilize your boons efficiently. Also many support builds are still caped for 5 .
---
Lol yeah, a very small community of radicals (who are looked down by actual LGBT people) totally disproves my point
---
Stay delusional.
---
I'm so jelly... I can't wait to have fun likw this when I get my skyscale. I hope they don't wall these places off... this sort of exploration is so much fun
---
Thats nonesense u can make money with crafting.
---
More than we think, but still less than ANet expected. 
---
I unlocked mine this last Friday. Finished the masteries on Saturday. Once you get past the first 2 collections, it's not as terrible as made out (and the raising part is very cute, other than the now reduced timegates). 
---
What I find odd about it is that unlocking it takes far, far longer than Mastering it, which was about the opposite for Griffon, Beetle, and Jackal. I don't remember the XP required for those, but Skyscale seemed less.
---
Yeah, and in a way I kind of understand the comments some Americans post here - most pride events in America really are just that, corporations capitalising on being woke and capturing the gay consumer identity.
---
To them they're nothing like in this part of the world, where it's very low-key events that are actually protests, actually campaigning for rights that LGBT people don't have.
---
When you've got 4-7 different builds on a single character depending on the modes you play, that's a *lot* of gear.
---
I said this on a post in the forums and anet removed it.
---
Read a guide then lol.
---
I just dont want to hear his voice...  his skills were cool tho.
---
ofc the guy with an exotic rifle with geomancy and no 2nd sigil would get the precursor
---
the ascended weapons look oversized on every race for some reason, the same issue is present with some black lion weapons (gallant set) which prevents me and my ocd from using their skins.
---
You made a comment and I gave you a wikipedia link of an existing movement that disproves your comment and you automatically started crying about bigotry and harassment. 
---
Ironically, a second later you decided to invalidate an entire movement of people by calling it delusional, but I'm supposed to be the ignorant bigot? You seem to be insanely intolerant of lebians who don't agree with you.
---
&gt;Blocked.
---
Imagine my shock.
---
If some Sylvari deserves a stance it would be Scarlet Briar:-P
---
sKILLED IT
---
Nope. If youre using 3 weapons and 1 stone it doesn't matter if it's the same type bc the result will be a random weapon type.
---
Only if you want e.g the legendary sword precursor you have to use 4 swords to get a sword out if Mystic Forge
---
You made a comment, I gave you a wikipedia link of an existing movement that disproves your comment and your first reaction is to start crying about bigotry and harassment.

You seem to be insanely intolerant of lebians who don't agree with you and are insanely quick to dismiss them and their lived experiences, and what for? They are too inconvinient to you?
---
Nope, because the ecto stone works like a mystic forge stone.
---
That's nice, honey.
---
When I was a broke noob, I remember Guild MM standing around in LA many nights telling people to pick a number between 1-100 or another large range. You'd know he was there when you saw map chat flooding with random numbers. One time I tied with someone and he told us we could split it or go for another round. We opted to risk it all and I won 300g, which was a ton to me at the time. I felt like i won the jackpot.
---
Ive said it before i would pay cold hard cash for a /headbang emote, let me rock out!
---
Each spawns 15 minutes after last one was done. They all spawn at once when map resets after meta.
---
There's a thread about it which has more info, try looking for it.
---
I can't stand the skyscale, i only use it if nothing else fits what i want to do. The bunny is just faster at doing what i want. The skyscale is just so slow.
---
Gays: exist in GW2
---
GW2: oof ouch anet i'm, dying :(
---
Combat in GW2 has a very different flow to it than GW, so they feel very different. I think they're definitely lots of fun, though.
---
Let's be honest, they *knew* what they were getting into when they released the mount. I doubt they'd have okayed it if they weren't resigned to things being broken.
---
I havent played gw1, but I heard it's generally very different.
---
You sell everything and use your gold to buy things off the gem store.
---
And what would the legend do exactly? Treaherne is a necromancer that's wielding a great sword and using guardian skills. 
---
The reason why there's no sylvari legends is because the sylvari race is quite young and the most legendary sylvari as of now is the sylvari commander. 
---
Truth be told. If there's any great word wielding revenant legend, it should be balthazar.
---
Nah, it should be a line on casting a well.
---
I noticed a lot of players seem to use griffon for general purpose land travel. Maybe it's fast enough for them to not care about the additional travel speed from raptor or jackal.
---
Personally, I'm a huge fan of the raptor mobility, aesthetic, and engage skill. Jackal has great mobility use (and instant direction change is not to be underestimated), but the animation is kinda stiff and dull compared to other mounts, and I don't get much use out of the engage barrier.
---
Only problem might be that it is a bit or a spoiler for people just getting into the game.
---
Alright, thanks!
---
Maybe leave it to the actual necromancer class
---
If it continues to happen for more than a few hours, open a support ticket describing your situation.
---
Chill bro
---
If Coalescence looks like this or Aurora, poof goes any chance of me making it even though my Hateful sworl etc is waiting
---
I think rev already is lacking in weapon choices. Warrior, mesmer, ele or thief can get a gimmicky weapon but rev needs something to swap to from double swords when on a power build. 
---
Staff keeps getting pushed into a support weapon and it hurts when you gotta swap to it when a breakbar appears.
---
Aside from those who simply like to glow in six colors and three shapes, it's like the [loudness war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war), where you can't win (stand out) without becoming distorted and unpleasant.
---
Best: Taimi
---
Very good: Most asura and sylvari voices, Canach, Inquest, Gorrik, Blish, quaggan, skritt, Scarlett (from what I've seen in cinematics/youtube vids)
---
Not-sure-if-want: Aurene?? o\_O
---
Kinda hate: Human female, norn female, haven't played male characters so don't really have opinions on those
---
Considering the legendary trinkets are just floating balls, maybe this is canon.
---
Story of Guild Wars 2 in a nutshell.
---
I've basically found zero use for the sky-scale. The springer is still faster for just about anything climbing related whilst the griffon is just outright better in all other flying situations. so it's the opposite of this meme for me tbhh
---
Yeah, and we could bore enemies to death! As a rev main, I'm in.
---
Just picture playing PvP and telling your opponents to get off your proverbial lawn. Exquisite.
---
This whole sub is Rick and morty fans. This explains a lot
---
Only if the well is an upkeep skill
---
Berserker gear? Same places it has been since 2012. I'm not gonna write up that list yet again.
---
As for assassin's, that's core as well, no?
---
At least you can reskin them to something that matches your taste or character's design.
---
You do find sylvari in the domain of the lost.
---
This is less the Springer's fault and more poor terrain design with overall collision detection. Terrain has been pushing me off the left or right of narrow structures for just walking straight for years before mounts. But yeah it doesn't help that new maps add these little "wall bumps" on purpose it seems sometimes. It's like they hate the Springer and Its very frustrating. Its why I never have been a fan of jumping puzzles, a lot of them utilize wonky terrain for "challenge".  Invisible bumps, or invisible solid ground, etc. Now it just hampers the main design purpose for a mount.
---
Lol, that image fits the situation way too perfectly.
---
I'd love that, but the problem is that it would probably HAVE to be a condition legend and we kind of already have one. Unless we're just going to power-creep this so Kalla is just a might/alacrity spec. So Rev would get two support elites and then this condi elite.
---
"Well done!" upon well deactivation.

I kinda want the legendary trinkets for the sake of having them, but until they effects can be hidden, Im not touching them, I usually go for rather minimalistic outfits and styles on my characters, this just ruins it =P
---
Yes that's the event I meant. Sorry I wasn't clear on that.
---
Commander, to me!
---
*We're going to need a bigger shadowstone.*
---
At some point relatively early on, it becomes a more economical use of gold to buy a shared slot, a permanent bank access, and bank tab expansions. Then you can just store all the stuff you usually carry around in your top bank tabs, as well as ascended gear with alternate stats.
---
or you can spend 30 minutes doing PvE and get all masteries.
---
"I'm rich, you know?"
---
To give you an idea, loot hasn't changed since ascended gear was introduced a long time ago. There's no gear grind with new content that comes out in terms of relative power. You go after gear mostly for the fashion aspect.
---
As for acquiring it, you have many ways to do it. You can craft armor and weapons, and get accessories from raids, fractals, maps, etc.
---
Ooh you know, that's actually really appealing to me. Everyone else here is like "oh I want a greatsword, I want more recognition for Trahearne" but the idea of mixing professions like that is really a fun idea. Elite specs are GW2's answer to GW1's multi-classing where you could be a warrior and an necromancer, so this would be thematically perfect.
---
I still want the egg backpack from HoT.
---
It can take slightly less time if you do daily quartz node farms, as charged quartz crystals are a RARE drop from mining them.
---
No love for the Necromesmardian?
---
because some peeps want GS on all classes
---
Then I don't know. Tried today for the first time, grabbed a couple of coins then killed the Choya and got the chest. Nobody in chat mentioned not getting the chest either.
---
([o]) Pact Seal of Approval
---
doesn't need to be, ele and dragonhunter use a lot of burning, but are still power specs
---
Thx all for the answers.
---
Thank you all for the answers.
---
i have actually reached that tower several times, all you need to do is griffon up near a map's edge and spam space till you're at max height, then you fly towards the area you want to reach, the invisible walls run high but compared to the max height you can reach in AB they run kind of short
---
&gt;I feel like his death didn't get much recognition. 
---
Trahearne had an entire epilogue side story dedicated to him and Calabold...
---
Go do it.
---
## #NOTMYPARADE keeping that downvote ration on 66%,nice try to hold DEMOCRACY in bay fucking mods,not gona happen,not gona happen on my watch,i will make sure that you CENSORING CUNTS WILL NOT PREVAIL.
---
You can also do WvW/PvP for tomes for tomes of knowledge. Then consume them or trade them to Miyani in bulk for shards.
---
My male sylvari has the Requiem set on.  I don't really play him much though.
---
Basically Asura and Sylvari have weirdly wide hips that mess with armor.  I have to find stuff that doesn't flare out, which is admittedly hard with some armor classes.
---
Usually the walls are to prevent trivialized access to objectives, map breakouts, or unfinished areas. I don't see any of those here, so it's probably safe... maybe?
---
This bug has been in the game since PoF came out. Whenever I complained that I didn't get my event chest, people would tell me "it's one per day!", missing the point that a) you can get it multiple times per day (only the new hero's choice chest is 1/day) and b) it was the first time I'd done it that day.
---
I doubt they'll fix it
---
Hey, I was coming to whine about another developer sacrificing their game to the Gods of diversity, but then I realized this is a player run event. That is freaking awesome! It is great to see the common person uniting for a just cause without some corporate shill forcing him/her to do it. Keep up the good work guys!
---
Top comment.
---
Yeah, I've been wanting perma bank so much. But everytime I start saving up golds or decide to buy some gems, I happen to spend it on something else.
---
Someday I'll get perma bank. Some day..
---
YES! I was trying to make a nice set of leather armor with some pretty leggings (the new mist blossom thingies are cool) and I found only 1 top that doesn't cover the bottom and it doesn't fit at all. There's one more that I thought was a short top (one that looks kinda middle eastern, that has a bit of underboob lol) but it also has something around the waist that covers the butt, I was disappointed.
---
No one played it, because it was barely advertised and had no achievements at all.
---
Rev shouldn't use people who die during playable parts of GW2. It's awkward in core or HoT to play with a Trahearne rev. Ventari already covers the sylvari-inspired rev being anyways. Let's get a golemancer being for the asura, like Snaff, Zinn, or Oola.
---
I feel like I missed it, can you elaborate?
---
So, instead of being visible, LGBT should just vanish out of sight? 
---
Because they need to go away but the bigotry should stay? If they are not visible, they will never be treated like "normal" people. We can see that all the time, whenever there is a gay couple in movies or television or even games. It could be purely optional to have same-sex romance options or they could be portrayed as the most normal people in the world and there will still be a lot of people coming around the corner: "Ugh, I don't want to see this, gay agenda, homosexuality is a disese blah blah blah". 
---
For me it's not about making a distinction that we are "different", it's about spreading awareness that we are people like everyone else, with the same rights. And that there are other countries that still kill people because they are not cis and/or straight. It is also a celebration about how far we have come and most obviously a reminder that there is a lot to do.
---
&gt; You have people running naked in the ugly default underwear all the time.
---
I agree, but my Asura necromancer, Commander of the Pact, Priory Magister and great Snaff Savant, has a swimsuit with little carrots on it and frankly it's kind of adorable.
---
You are a sad little fella, who hurt you?
---
Yeah, that works.
---
I normally don't tip when I use a port or mine a home instance or ask for tips when I port or open my home instance. I just don't think it's necessary for such a small amount of effort.
---
That would actually be a really interesting concept for a rifle build on Rev! I can't see how it would be very different from a rifle engi/holo though. Maybe if they the legend was Ceara and the elite had something to do with scarlet, lots of possibilities! Though again, rifle can't be an easy play style to make for a Rev.
---
I don't. It requires no effort unless it's Chalice of Tears in which it (still?) requires multiple portals and can be fucked up.
---
I play PoF since release and didn't know this was a thing until now.
---
Thanks for the support!
---
Although to be fair, Guild Wars 2 has had LGBTQ+ lead characters in all 3 of its main storylines (including the storyline of the book that precedes Guild Wars 2), has several minor queer characters in the game, including a trans character who talks about being trans, has LGBTQ+ developers, including a prominent dev who worked both on game design &amp; the soundtrack for Heart of Thorns, Path of Fire and Season 4, who is trans, and ArenaNet does support this event every year :P
---
So if this event is something that'd make you think GW2 is "sacrificing their game to the Gods of diversity", I think that ship has long since sailed :P
---
I was not suggesting this as the sole method of gaining XP, but as an addition.
---
Dude's on like, their 6th account after they got banned, you know, after calling LGBT people triggered snowflakes lmao
---
lol yikes don't listen to forums and gw2 discord
---
He's also calling the mods nazis and stalking and harrasing them in other subreddits. Imagine being that petty.
---
I've been doing ports for other people a decent amount during the skyscale collection, no tip required. One person gave me some gold because they had been "pulling their hair out" in derilect delve
---
Yep I gathered a buttload of coins, slayed many troublemakers and got credit for all those events. In any case, I would usually get the bonus chest whether I participated in the coin gathering or not.
---
They dont have to port you either. 
---
It's nice to be nice. Its nice to show appreciation too..
---
Hmm this only happened today for the first time for me. Perhaps I was just lucky all those previous times and it didn't bug for me.
---
* Are the builds on MetaBattle up to date? I noticed most of them are from 2018. If they're outdated, is there another place I can find builds?
---
* do the zones in living story s3 have their own vendors that give out gear and stuff similar to s2?
---
W5 and 6 are actually more difficult.
---
I don't tip and I don't expect to be tipped either when I'm porting.
---
&gt;  ALS ice bucket challenge
---
That took place in the real world not a fantasy world that has no effect on the real world or its politics. 
---
If you want to make real world change, keep it in the real world, this is just a vanity project and painting targets on peoples backs. 
---
I see people as people in game, suddenly I see some as "Gay" or "Former male to female" instead "Hey a cool person". 
---
That is the COMPLETE opposite these people should be striving for but here we are, knowing they are gay is far more important to them than just getting on with life.
---
People just getting into the game wouldn't be unlocking this elite anyways without playing at least some new story for it, and if they're skipping so much of the previous story to get to the new stuff it's their own fault if they're spoiled.
---
I'm stuck for "brandstone research" achievement day 6 need to complete "Akili escort" I used /bug to report this problem and if any Dev may help us it will be great
---
big no, bunch of newb pretending to be pro there
---
I'd still love Trahearne rev, but Snaff rev would be great!
---
Mist trinkets are your best bet. You can get them through PvP, WvW, and Fractals. As ascended, they can be moved around, and they have the semi-unique ability (amongst asc trinkets) to be stat swapped by using [Mist Capacitor](]https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mist_Capacitor). Going off of the cheapest method to purchase MC, Shards of Glory, swapping the set costs ~1.5g.
---
&gt; Caithe &amp; Faolain used to be together, there is a gay Sylvari couple in the early Personal Story 
---
You realize Sylavari don't have genders right so how does this even count? 
---
Talk about projecting your biases to make a point.
---
Best way I have found is just do a couple of adventures. Easily get around 100k exp for each one if you get gold(even better if you haven‚Äôt done that adventure before)
---
???
---
Depends on the JP. 
---
For example last time I got potted through chalice of tears for aurora I gave him 50G
---
Tell you what, we can continue this discussion about what's the point of pride when we ARE at the point where I don't have to be afraid getting beaten up just because I wanted to kiss my partner in public or when there are no political parties trying to take these rights away (or do something worse).
---
Noooo! Trahearne was the lamest and most boring character of the whole game. Let him be gone for good.
---
You can hide backpacks though.
---
Complains about raid lore that is related to the actual story being gated behind raid content.
---
I think 50 silver is fair if you search for a home instance. It's quite a diffrence if people open a homeinstance they gather at that time anyways. Or if people search for a open home instance and sombody volunteers. Because in that cause the opener gets to stand around 10 mins till everyone has finished with gathering.
---
One decent way of making money is using spare materials to make cheap lvl 80 rares and salvaging them for ectos. It's easiest on a tailor because silk is so cheap, but you could do it on a weaponsmith. It takes alot of t5 materials to make alot of weapons, but you get a decent return on investment. Currently Rampager Krait Shells are the cheapest thing you can make with weaponsmith for ectos. [&amp;AgEgPAAA]
---
Luckily cleared instances exist, and the fights themselves barely contain any lore at all. Plus the fact that it's all side story, just like Fractals, Dungeons and other instanced content.
---
Depends on build really. Some of them dont change often, some not at all, some are just there as a guidance (open world ones) since anything similar to that will work just fine etc.
---
If you need raid/fractal build check snowcrows/discretize.
---
Original poster states they use build templates which allows for quick swapping. Your solution doesn't even come close to that level of convenience or speed.
---
50 silver for a home instance? Isn't that like 80% of the profit you gain from harvesting it?
---
I‚Äôd say the game encourages it since cosmetic items dominate the bulk of the game‚Äôs content
---
I've always wanted the greatsword legend to be Turai Ossa.
---
They could play into the lore of the characters size and strength by making the animations hold the Greatsword one handed with an eternal shield automatically appearing in the other hand. Spec weapon could be [Turai's sword](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Turai%27s_Sword) with the ascended version being the [Eternal Blade](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Eternal_Blade).
---
You're correct. It does take a pretty large investment to really start liquidating your assets properly. I've listened to a gold making lecture from Xushin, who is in the same farming guild as Guild MM, and his advice for anyone wanting to get rich is to make at least 1 legendary for profit and invest that back into making more.
---
Of course, that was just a general fashion complaint.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with lady spirits?
---
Why are you being such a dick? ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is wrong with you?‚Äù. Like Jesus man calm down I just wanted to share it. Not everyone has already done it, otherwise the S4 maps would be completely dead already and that‚Äôs not the case. Piss off.
---
I really REALLY think it would be reasonable for anet to dedicate a small patch to the hats and their interactions with hair in this game (Especially since character customization takes center stage in this game) . There's so many skins, mistwalker cap is a sore spot for me for example, that straight up remove the hair and it's a shame cause a lot of them would be great otherwise.

Just when i think iv seen everything this game has to offer lmao. Last week got blocked and reported for botting by a com because when i asked him to move to group2 i didnt say "please".
---
I send my two blues and a green from the JP if its the daily, since I am there for quick daily completion, not the loot.
---
It depends what the puzzle is.  I generally won't tip for normal puzzles because I like to run them myself.  I'll occasionally tip for things like Portmatt's or other "special" JP that are less jumping and more problem-solving because I can't be bothered.
---
RaIdS aRe tOo hARd

Nah because I'm also entitled to an opinion and my opinion is that you were being a dick
---
I may be wrong but: I don't tip anybody. As an exchange I help others by opening portal for them.
---
Just do good stuff without expecting to be rewarded for it. Having a friendly community is the best payment ever.
---
It‚Äòs a quite common issue nowadays and anet seems to be neglecting the issue and it‚Äòs outcomes.

Fucked over quite a few people last 2 days of pvp season

Booker, catch!

I contacted them and they said they can't replace mine.

Finally some good fucking food

Also the people getting upset about this omg please relax it's a light hearted joke lol

I don't tip, I even return tips if I get them... We're playing a video game, we're not waiters in a US restaurant...

Hmmm, maybe so. I have however seen a lot of simmilar posts there so seem to fit the general format they have there.
---
Person A doing person A stuff.

Person B coming up to person A demands to get stuff for free.

Person A politely rejects.

Person B throwing a tantrum and/or tries to guilt trip person A to  give them stuff anyways.

Do you have any sylvari characters?
---
If you answered "yes," then congratulations, you have a pansexual character
---
sure aint kid
---
go and see a therapist you fucking weirdo
---
Oh, its more the fact that u still didnt Quote the ToS part u mentioned.
---
You actually don't need a level 80 character to get mounts. You can use a level 80 friend to open that instance and kill the level 80 mobs at the beginning for you.
---
I usually tip when some does a HP train over a couple maps. Like a gold or two. I don't use the gold for anything nowadays any how. üëå
---
They do have genders. It's pretty clear that they have genders actually.
---
Maybe stop projecting your own biases to put down LGBT folks
---
Is there a big difference in how hard either is to play or is the difficulty comparable?
---
The commander, however, has several responses.
---
"Commander, a word please."
---
"Yes, Trahearne. What is it?"
---
"Yes? You want something, Trahearne?"
---
"Commander,"
---
"WHAT!? WHAT IN AURENE'S NAME DO YOU WANT!?"
---
"... a word please"
---
I gotta send this to Sourunji :D
---
I usually don't tip and I don't expect tips when I am porting - if I have a portal at hand, I always open it for ppl who might want it.
---
I have the same problem, I only get the chest once per character and then never again (Yes, I know it only drops once a day).
---
Doesn't matter if I complete all the casino blitz rounds or if I just kill the pinata.
---
I think the Meta events in the HoT Maps are very fun to do. 
---
The monster hunting could be bountys, which are only in PoF Maps and the LS-Maps of PoF. 
---
Going for a legendary is always very fun for me personally, especilly the Generation 2 Precursor hunts are very fun to do (only some have it, everything released after the mace only has a gold-drain as the precursor hunt).
---
I would suggest doing Nevermore since you could also use that as a guard.
---
You know that you can turn off your chat? and in my almost 7 years of playing, I never EVER had a conversation about whos gay or straight. 
---
Maybe not mentioning that will help you, but hey, then you cant play this victim card and how toxic everyone is, right? Mostly its pople who dong give a shit what you are but when someone is forcing this shit down your throat, it gets annoying and thats the problem.
---
Downvotes inc!
---
Go on gw2 wiki and search for event timers (or just google it).
---
Find HoT section.
---
Check which meta event is happening soon.
---
Join map ~20 mins before that and check for groups in there.
---
Wait for the event to start.
---
Profit.
---
Just make sure you have a waypoint on each map. For TD you'll need the south WP specifically, otherwise it might be hard to go where you need to be.
---
The only difficult part of raids is getting 9 other people to actually engage with the mechanics instead of stroking their epeens off to their DPS.
---
No Reaper-player, I don't care about your DPS when trying to just remove the shield on Dhuum (that you're only pulling the numbers on because of super wide AoE attacks on all the spiders, though you're doing piss-poor damage on the actual Enforcers), now can you PLEASE stop referring to that arbitrary number and successfully catch 5 souls? Oh you flew into the center again despite being told to avoid the center column explicitly about 6 times now? And that's a wipe, awesome.
---
My character was there too.
---
I'm sorry to hear that. :/
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spellbreaker#Trivia
---
In the trivia section you can see that they likened it to the GW1 Warrior/Mesmer mix
---
&gt; I don't know why OP integrated that in the post (maybe he was just told about this effect and didn't check his information),
---
My main is a mesmer. I had Aurora and the Aurora effect, but my clones got the Aurora+Vision effect.
---
Another person's mesmer had Aurora+Vision and the Aurora+Vision effect, but their clones got the Aurora+Vision+something effect.
---
With the 3rd legendary trinket coming in like a week, it's logical to assume that, since clones are derivatives of your character, the function used for displaying clone effects erroneously counted your character's trinket as 1 (or outright 2?) extra trinkets, and displayed the effect from further in the line.
---
It's actually a good idea if you are doing hearts etc anyway, but probably not the easiest specifically for XP.
---
(I just played dragonfall for the experience, and got chests too)
---
This pretty much. My go tons of it is in Jahai. There is a route I do daily towards my spirit shards. I start in the eastern waypoint where the farm is and fly my way to the western area of the map. Two character runs is enough to hit the daily cap and it's just a hair under a full level.
---
Any chance you could link that? Did a search and found nothing and I hadn't seen any updated taco timers posted since the patch, somehow missed it.
---
Chrono might be a little trickier due to Continuum Split management, but with Mirage clone and dodge management is more important, so they aren't far apart.
---
I have both, and while I love the hair contract, the utility of the bank access is unparalleled. It completely changes the way you interact with the inventory system at a fundamental level. And as a fashion bonus, it has access to the wardrobe tab, so you can browse it from anywhere in the game.

I got volunteered to take over an EBG WvW Squad (I guess I was the first firebrand they hovered over to pass the tag)
---
I never commanded in WvW before; I didn't have any siege on me, and I was running this firebrand for maybe the 3rd time ever; in suboptimal gear.
---
let's just say PvD is not an effective way to invade a tower; but it works.
---
If we have to hide in order to be accepted then it might as well not even be acceptance. It's like telling Jewish people that if they don't want to "make themselves a target" they should stop publicly practicing their religion and not have synagogues in public areas. You're essentially blaming the victims of oppression. If someone has a pride parade it doesn't force anyone else to become a homophobe. If you weren't a homophobe in the first place then a pride event wouldn't "paint a target on our backs." 
---
Plus history has shown that everything you're saying is bullshit. Even back when LGBT people mostly hid and kept to themselves, it didn't stop them from facing violence and it didn't stop police from raiding gay bars. You don't care if we "keep to ourselves" you care that we even exist at all because our very existence makes you question the gender and sexuality norms you were raised with, and any reminder that we exist sends you into a tizzy because of it.
---
Acceptance isn't about pretending nobody has any differences, it's not about conforming to the norm in order to hide those differences and make you more comfortable, because if that is necessary then it's not truly acceptance, it's denial. Acceptance is about knowing that people are different and celebrating those differences and accepting them ANYWAY.
---
And please stop pretending you're a victim and whining about downvotes because people don't agree with you, you're not the only one allowed to have opinions.
---
Enlighten me then.
---
Fuckkkkk no. Give us actually interesting characters (preferably more villains as well) like:
---
Vizier Khilbron (undead lich)
---
Svanir
---
Master Togo 
---
Razah 
---
Varesh Ossa 
---
Aesgir Dragonrender
---
&gt; I'd rather NOT have most of the varied, flexible style options locked behind long, expensive, tedious grinds.
---
I mean, we already have thousands of affordable options, including dyeable mix-and-match armour, and the multiple colours of Vanilla ascended weapons and HoT guild weapons. It's just that cool legendary-level features like shape morphing or footfals or actually subtle and pretty auras are locked behind single pre-determined colour schemes despite being locked behind the aforementioned "long, expensive, tedious grinds" in the first place.
---
Why do you let a dps player do a green and why does the death of one dps player result in a wipe?
---
I suppose Scholar classes have it way too easy with the [Heritage Greatcoat](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heritage_armor_(light))  (`[&amp;CikDAAA=]`) (and perhaps [Radiant Leggings](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Radiant_Leggings) (`[&amp;CtMVAAA=]`)).
---
They say its a bug, but they dont say this is the effect for using 3 trinkets together or not ;)
---
&gt;How can you not grasp the concept of "People hate people different to them and that is NEVER EVER EVER going to change"?
---
We grasp the concept, it's just that we're not defeatist wimps and cowards like yourself who refuse to do anything about it because if we didn't we'd still be stuck in the dark ages when women couldn't own property and we sure as shit wouldn't have gotten gay marriage. 
---
Apathy doesn't make you cool.
---
You don't have less rights for being a guy, nobody's regulating your body parts like they do with women lol.
---
You don't have any risk of being slapped for being a "creepy guy" unless you're creepy, so have you just tried not being a fucking creep?
---
You have any idea how high the rates are for trans people being murdered, that hate crimes against LGBT people in general have been going UP in recent years, etc? Do you have any idea what it's like to be denied housing, jobs or medical care because of your gender or sexuality? Look up FBI statistics and see how many people are killed for being LGBT as opposed to people who are killed for being male or white, go ahead, I'll wait. Look that up and tell me your oppression is equal to theirs.
---
Everyone faces problems and prejudice, but trying to deny that being gay or transgender doesn't put an extra target on your back that you wouldn't otherwise have if you were straight and cis is just being delusional.
---
yeah such macro might not be allowed, but lets be honest ... no one will get banned for using simple macros with 2-5 keys.
---
The rule is mostly for bots,
---
Looks like a system limitation. I can see the best they doing having it either on or off, whilst still retaining function, but the difference between ascended weapons and these trinkets are one set is individual skins, and the other is, I guess, an effect?
---
We're the triggered ones because we don't like racism, even though they're the ones who fly off the handle and make tons of sockpuppet accounts just because they're so offended that we EXIST.
---
I love that my existence makes them so mad tbh.
---
I feel that. For me, it's usually just that I get focused on doing something else at the time and end up forgetting.
---
Wow! Shuyin Sourunji here and I was surprised people still remembered that, haha. 
---
Lots of people came together for those many trials and tribulations when Triple Trouble came out and it was a lot of fun to throw ourselves at that fight. Lot of work from everyone involved leading up to that first kill and the many that came after, and the level of efficiency people still crank out for that fight. 
---
I just happened to be the loudest. ~
---
There's been some new boss fights since then but has never been quite another Triple Trouble, so maybe more content like that will come around someday. Here's hoping.
---
Thanks for the shoutout on a great video, and a big thanks to all those in the community who finally came and conquered that wurm!
---
Since when is finding something funny triggering to you? Please make sense when you try to discredit someone's opinion.... i thought it was funny. Let me guess you are white knight who protects all wahmen lol? I just dont marry why would you think mention of a women triggers me? Are you just a gigantic simp or something? Let me guess next you are going to call me an incel lol

Missed the guardian edit, but sounds like you found the builds on the website for guardian.
---
As for the traits missing, il give you a temporary build for your core guardian:
---
Zeal: 2, 2, 3
---
Radience: 3, 3, 3
---
Virtues: 1, 2 , 3
---
The numbers correlate to the trait you have to select in order. e.g. Zeal = Fiery wrath, zealous blade, symbolic avenger.
---
In order to get exotic level 80 berserker gear, you can buy it of the trading post, craft it at level 400 weaponsmith/armorsmith, get it dropped pretty much anywhere if you are lucky, or do dungeons and spend the tokens at the dungeon vender.

If you meant ascended gear, then craft at level 500 weaponsmith/armorsmith, dropped from fractals or raids. (there are other ways, but those are the main and most likely)
---
Metabattle is usually fine. The comments often let you know if it's out of date.
---
Season 3 has a *lot* of ascended trinkets you can get, as well as a few cosmetic pieces. Season 4 has a few armour (e.g requiem and elegy) and a few weapon (e.g astral and stellar) lines.
---
The only people I tip are the noobs in noob region who participate in my shenanigans.
---
Last time I made an inventory trash fundraiser. People sent me garbage and I returned gold. Then I sent all the trash to people who laughed at my fundraiser.
---
I think he is just "happy" to see that tree x)
---
Well you are wrong and did you really go through my post history and then make a throw away just to post this? Why?
---
I completed all masteries after popping a booster and doing one full Dragonfall run. No need to do tedious hearts. Events were always the way to level quickly
---
My hearT is melting
---
As someone who recently - finally - after 6 years of GW2 picked up FF14, I have to say their game is impressive for two reasons in comparison which both feel backwards:
---
* GW2, the "fashion wars" MMO, has **less** emotes and **less** capable personalization capabilities. The overdone and mandatory item fx, the blinding and non-optional (they can be turned off in FF14) spell fx during combat, it comes together to make for a game where I neither care nor can even **see** what someone looks like. FF14 fares better in this, a result of its rather carefully crafted armor in many cases coupled with a far simpler engine.
---
* Outfits are delivered as a single thing instead of in pieces. Shouldn't a focus on fashion mean you want to do crazy shit with your outfits?
---
uhm, ignoring means I'd need to have noticed...
---
According to this there is a kid by the waypoint of highjump ranch that throws is ball into a tree?  
---
Funny thing is, highjump ranch is my go-to waypoint... I don't think I've ever noticed.
---
I've got plenty of gold just sitting there and if someone is taking their time to stand at the end of a jumping puzzle to make an extra buck for a legendary they've been trying to craft, you bet your ass i'm going to drop 10g in their mail. Because like people say.. its a video game and why the hell not? In turn ill be helping them enjoy the game more with their upcoming new shiny legendary/skin/collection/etc etc
---
Aristocrat top (Human light T2 cultural) would be a perfect fit.
---
Lmao tipping is utter garbage, don't do it. The fact that US media outlets are pushing us so hard to tip hotel staff/airport staff, public transit providers in addition to waitstaff is pathetic. "You should pay anyone and everyone in the service industry in addition to your bill so the owners/company executives don't have to." No thanks.

*Cries in Riding Skyscales*

&gt; but because he was the Commander's friend

I hate this so much.

Oh how I love playing hide &amp; seek with the commander in squad group 1
---
ah yes, springtime, when love is in the air, and all across the land of Tyria, Springers unite to hump trees
---
What part of it?
---
Commanders who waste other peoples time by including their friends or guild mates who have absolutely no clue of anything.

why you think you need to share that information? we dont know you so why it would be important for us in anyway?  
---
I ate pizza today and make a big poo, do I share that info with everyone?   
---
Gw2 reddit is not your personal facebook wall, we are not your friends, dont share information that dont have any use for community, because thats just spam.
---
I would definitely love to have him back as a Revenant stance! He's the character I feel more affectionated to in the game and I certainly miss him. As for the weapon I think Greatsword would be cool, or alternatively, a Scepter could be interesting, maybe an Orrian themed one.
---
I wanted to share it because I felt like it. Stop being such a dick. If you don‚Äôt like the post, downvote and move on. Don‚Äôt stick around to be an insufferable piece of shit.
---
Nah, tybalt stance. Throw apples
---
System limitation is true, although it just means "not coded in that way [yet]".
---
The only "accessory" item slot that has a skin attached is a backpack. End of story. The way the legendary accessories get around that is by giving you a hidden buff.
---
The "proper" fix is to create an actual skin slot for trinkets, with the position set as center of body (irrelevant location, simply a placeholder as needed, center of body is good reference point). Go over every accessory and give them null skins (can be done with a script over game files, annoying but necessary). Re-work the buffs into skins, using the location data to properly position them (it's probably already set to center of body).
---
This also gives way for "unique" trinkets, transmutation, and the like.
---
But still, RIP Mariner's Rebreather.
---
Core:
---
- Shiro: Human (Cantha)
---
- Jalis: Dwarf
---
- Mallyx: Demon
---
- Centaur: Sylvari
---
- Invocation: none
---
**Elites**
---
- Glint: Dragon
---
- Kalla: Charr
---
So really we need Norn &amp; Asura before we get another Sylvari legend ;)  
---
I also think that Trahearne got a pretty excellent send off with the Knight of the Thorn quest line and statue in the Grove.
---
Yeah, Traeherne is nothing compared to Balthazar, and many people were actually annoyed by that salad with barely any characterization. Makes zero sense to have him as a stance instead of an incredibly famous god figure with a unique style of GS fighting.  
---
Like really, there was absolutely nothing shown of his personality. Is he noble? Maybe, I dunno. I only learned that he was a necromancer when fighting his echo in Caladbolg quests.  
---
Would be a shame to waste a specialization slot on him.
---

One of the early utility skills a necro can unlock, a nice 25% passive movement speed boost.
---
Just buy gold for gems and buy all the crafting material from the TP
---
It's an overgrown rabbit. What did you expect
---
By my calculations at current trading post prices: In a fully unlocked home instance, you'd get 1g 11s 26c after the trading post's cut.
---
If you also include the home instance garden being 8 cassava root nodes, add an additional 10s 67c.
---
If you also include the volatile magic from gathering the LS4 nodes, add an additional 29s 50c.
---
If you're also using a volatile magic glyph, add an additional 1g 36s 5c.
---
Notes and Assumptions:
---
All gathering attempts are successful. (Infinite use gathering or at least a level 60 character with orichalcum gathering equipment)
---
The leather and racks gave 2 of each type of item.
---
The black lion garden plots are 8 generic gathering strikes for glyph purposes, unless assumed to be cassava roots as shown above.
---
The loot from chests (bandit, auric, etc.) were not factored in to the calculation.
---
Anything fancy about it? I tried this with a friend. We went up to/through the raptor bit, but she said she couldn't access the mount with the bind. Do we have to finish the instance for it to work?
---
Poor country aka. can't got mom's credit card info
---
Fashion friendly isn‚Äôt the same as fashion focused.
---
It's a shame that his endorsement of NAMBLA somewhat overshadows many of his greater accomplishments.
---
I'm aware of our history. We didn't have the ability to even have any dialogue until Stonewall and the people who fought afterwards. And there is and probably always will be a time where we will have to shout to be heard. This thread isn't one of them. When you have a chance to actually have a meaningful dialogue with someone that may actually change and broaden someone else's opinion including the silent people reading this thread, you should do it. 
---
You can be an uppity queen, but what exactly did that accomplish? Throwing shade is easy. Being antagonistic is easy. Making change is hard. Your choice I guess.
---
Yeah likewise I wish some things had configuration. I like the tiny top hat for example, but if you use it on asura it makes the rest of their head bald what the hell. Actually a number of asura cultural helmets do this as well which is a damn shame because I otherwise really like those hats
---
Once, when capping a sentry in WvW, I didn't notice another person running to it, got a whisper "asshole!!!", realized it's from this guy, wanted to reply "sorry I didn't see you" - as I really was spaced out at the time, - only to get "this person is blocking you". Oh well.
---
i'd love a reminder, thanks! :D
---
Fuck no. Let's not sell gear directly for real money, okay?
---
It's not like it's hard to get, and it's not like there is a hurry to "catch up" in this game.
---
Yea, that happened to me too today.
---
Got my chest at one of the next Pinatas.
---
Some of the mats are locked behind currencies or farming. I have plenty of gold.
---
Was mostly just going for a joke there (indicated by the universal symbol of /s) still I'd say a thief is faster, just equip a shortbow
---
You get a full exotic set with the level 80 boost (ascended is only 5% stronger). It's not amazing stats but supplement that with ascended trinkets/rings which are stupid quick to get with the LWS3 maps (looking at you winterberries). Then start working on your ascended armor. PvP gives you a way of putting together a stat-selectable set, Fractal drops could be improved, but they are another way if you don't feel like crafting. You can buy all of the ascended materials off the TP as well, and bypass the time-gate, so you can put your $40 towards that.
---
I tried and tested this with a guildmate. It works for him. 
---
Has your friend talked to Aksim after completing the heart? Did your friend complete the heart? It is the only way to get the raptor. You don't need to finish the instance. What I did was I laid back and let my friend do the fire extinguishing. 
---
Does your friend have Path of Fire?
---
If you answer no to above, I have no idea.
---
Wood is wood..
---
I've been playing this game for 5.600 hours and only own four(!) pieces of ascended armor. Why only four? Because ascended armor is an unnecessary little bonus and I've never felt the need to craft any more.
---
Weapons and trinkets are easy enough to obtain already.
---
Mist Trinkets + Blood Ruby Trinkets both stat swap. There you go. You're welcome. Now you don't need to worry about the legendary!
---
Oh that makes sense. My first character was indeed a sylvari and I am not sure I even completed the entire story with a different race later on.
---
Thank you for the explanation :)
---
you dont need boon uptime for providing perma 25 might and fury for up to 10 people
---
Uhhhhhhhhhhh...
---
Oh my!
---
Fun build? Playable build? I slightly disagree...
---
You are talking from a very narrow perspective, which is only raids. But let me tell you this, there is more to the game than just raids. 
---
Shield actually had relevance in PvP/WvW before offhand sword got reworked/buffed. Same goes for offhand axe on power classes. Offhand shield **was** actually a valid weapon choice and generated build diversity. Now this being said, I agree with you that shield, currently, is indeed underwhelming due to sword buffs. But that doesnt mean it never had relevance or spawned new builds, quiet the opposite, it did. 
---
Shortbow was pure trash in the beginning. It actually didnt had ANY use untill way after release when they finally buffed it. You would just camp mace/axe back in the day. Why is that relevant you ask? Whether a weapon is underwhelming or overwhelming isnt a good arguement to what a class really needs as weapon power is a changing factor. Shield was once great, shortbow was once shit. It changes, yet I still find more use for shield than for shortbow outside the raid scenario. Yet I can still mix and match it more than shortbow. Let me tell you this, neither kalla nor shortbow find ANY use outside the raid scenario, they are literal trash in PvP/WvW.
---
Revenant, amongst all classes, has the lowest offhand/mainhand weapon count in relation to **effective skills**. This makes it hard enough to be build crafty with rev, another twohand weapon doesnt change that. A onehand weapon has the actual potential to do so.
---
There is no content except high tier fractals that REQUIRES ascended gear.
---
Unfortunately fashion wars has been replaced by "eye cancer wars" for most people in this game.
---
dude if you cant gear yourself up while playing, do a little credit card farming, buy some gems, switch to gold and buy that gear you want (exotic is enough to do any "starting" end game content
---
Yeah I didnt like Trahearne of of hate. I just didnt like him because I think the story written around him.
---
E X O R D I U M S H I N Y
---
Ahah, I didn't know politics was a thing in this game
---
most account bound mats (see lump of mithrilium) build into sellable mats (see xunlai). This is the same with spiritwood planks etc so yes, you can buy a full set w.o time gates
---
Yeah the skyscale isn't as fast (especially now that the springer got buffed with the skyscale's release) but can go further and isn't countered by overhangs.
---
&gt;If you're so unaccepting
---
This is a small-minded view of the situation.
---
If a person is fine with gay characters but not fine with real life politics in their videogames, isn't that indication that they *aren't* bigoted against gay people, but rather that they just don't want to deal with politics in their entertainment?
---
People who play the victim all the time are trashy
---
Mastery points will most likely be more of a gate than XP. So if it's just that thought, don't worry too much about it.
---
Yes because passive movement speed is such a rare thing to get.
---
Pick up a fresh account and play by yourself for about 10 hours max a week whenever you can find the time. Then tell me you want to spend half of that grinding.
---
Griffon races give a lot of XP
---
This sounds like a very bad idea. Rampager Pearl Shells consume about 50 silver worth of materials to craft. You would lose a good 30 silver per ecto gained. Better to just sell the materials.
---
http://www.gw2spidy.com/recipe/5753
---
Same. The graceful contours of the crafted ascended weapons are so pleasing to the eye, plus the subtle oscillating glow, and small hanging parts. So good.   
---
And most of the Gen1 legendaries are these clunky monstrosities with sharp random parts sticking out, barely any style to them.
---
yes please!
---
it seems pretty obvious that you are german (or similar) though xd
---
the "√Ñhm" and "nekro" kinda give it away xd (might also be a country with a northern germanic language but i think that's a little less likely)
---
man some people are just entitled.
---
even if it was 10 times less workhours for you... how do they get the audacity...
---
Next time just say the following:
---
***"Please elaborate on how exactly i am being rude.."***
---
***"Please elaborate further on this matter"***
---
**Then keep repeating this line until he stops talking, for the sake of amusement, or just ignore him in the first place.**
---
Honestly? No you're absolutely right, as does FFXIV at this point.
---
&gt;bigot
---
&gt;    n.
---
&gt;    One who is strongly partial to one's own group, religion, race, or politics and is intolerant of those who differ.
---
People feel like bigot is a synonym of homophobe, it isn't, if you're an LGBT person and you start insulting someone as soon as they suggest anything that differ from your exact point of view, that's actually being a bigot by definition too
---
Yeah I completely agree. The baldness makes me not want to get any of those hats. I think the swaggering hat at least has some hair attached so it‚Äôs the only option we get.
---
How do you get the recipes and the dragonite/empereal/bloodstone stuff off the trade post?
---
Or like the Elder Scroll in ES trilogy. They exist as a escape-goat when devs need it. There is nothing wrong with it for as long as they use this idea with a defined purpose.
---
Your use of xd kind of makes it seem like you're from Germany too

It's so bizarre honestly, FFXIV makes a killing off of selling exclusive emotes and emotes from past events that aren't available ingame anymore. Despite milking damn near every other aspect, they *still* haven't gone after emotes. 
---
People in FFXIV will pay *seven dollars* for a single dance on top of their sub in FFXIV. Does Anet honestly not believe there is profit to be made there?
---
I‚Äôve got a full home instance, and have never accepted a tip for it, I‚Äôm just glad to see it be used.
---
Regarding JPs, I‚Äôm not a fan of them at all. Platformers are amongst my favorite games, I just don‚Äôt like the physics in GW2. When a collection requires one, I‚Äôll typically use a portaler, and will tip 5-10 gold.
---
The lack of commas makes it look like you're listing two people, and one of them has plenty of titles.
---
Sure, it sounds like a bad idea NOW, but festival of the four winds is coming up soon and ectos are going to skyrocket in prices. Sometimes you have to play the market. I saw that you needed to make astral weapons for vision and bought a truckload of rose quartz while it was still cheap, then sold it when the prices spikes and made around 500g.
---
T3 Human heavy cultural is still the best damn heavy set in the game a human character can wear, and I feel that way about a *lot* of base game armors sadly.
---
And the Celebration Cap. Id pay for an additional hair option on my barbies.
---
How do you escalate a ticket ? Do you just ask the GM you are talking to , to escalate it, or you post a new ticket ? 
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Lol I was on that squad and yeah it was pretty fucking stupid of the com even without seeing most of the conversation
---
&gt;and "forcing politics on people" points.
---
This is a legit point though. People play video games to get away from real life.
---
how about the option "fast cast" + lock ground target to target?
---
A community is willing to do this themselves,  fuck off. They can do it if they want.
---
Was a good laugh though, best pinata sq id ever been in
---
Then don't play a game that requires you to actually invest time, or atleast don't complain about it, if you're not able to.
---
If you stand on the hand of the Abaddon statues at the shrines in Siren‚Äôs Landing, an interact prompt appears too.
---
I've seen people mention potential for August because of the anniversary. Be very careful about purchasing discount keys from non-approved retailers, as you can get banned if the key was purchased with a stolen card etc.
---
Every class has a signet like that. Without mounts, high movement characters are those with perma swiftness or lots of movement skills.
---
I still refuse to believe that 3rd trinket form is even the real intended form, and not just some debug mesh of some sort. It just looks so awful.
---
I'm from a country where I can afford internet and a PC and no, I can't afford this game. My wife bought it from me, she comes from a wealthier country. Out there are hundreds of realities different to what Americans and Europeans are used to. Internet in my country is cheap but slow, and my PC can play GW2 in low settings; I need this PC to work.
---
I can't afford most games with my pay check and I work at a decent place, don't generalize.
---
I finished unlocking my firebrand, and i geared him out with exotics vipers. I was putting in the runes, which metabattle suggested the Renegade runes. As i was putting in the runes, i was watching the condition damage numbers go up out of curiosity. When i put in the last rune, my condition damage stayed at 933. I accidentally made an extra vipers helm and swapping that one out (which doesnt have a rune) the condition damage stays the same. My skill damage numbers dont even change. Is the +7% of the renegade runes not apply, or am i missing something?
---
It is yeah, which always felt like a massive design flaw to me.
---
No I'm sorry to sound harsh but these posts are stupid. We don't know Anets internal thinking on discounts for all we know we could get one with the bloody raid.
---
It something that baffles me as well. Though I must say that deciding on fashion in FFXIV is horrible, as there is no preview wadrobe system, so you gotta build outfits with whatever you com across since you just don't know what kind of gear is out there for you.
---
I occasionally tip for daily JPs. I think I always have tipped for anyone doing a HP train. Especially if it runs very smoothly. If someone put in the time to write the scripts they‚Äôre pasting and learned the routes perfectly to then lead a team of cats all the way through HoT, they can have a gold or equivalent on me.
---
And also extremely impractical compared to a legendary.
---
Even quicker to just pop some boosters and go ham on areas with a high density of enemies that don't get cleared often. 10k exp per enemy and most yellow mobs die in less than a few seconds.
---
vekk
---
:)
---
i never knew about the rune locked doors in derelict delve until the skyscale collection, i found them fun and did all the collections whilst inside. at the end in room 4 there was a commander tag that i could easily have tp2f and skipped it all, but i'm not sorry i didnt use him.
---
Most probably the process of refunding cost of encapsulators will be refunded in later patch as bug was widespread, which is the reason why support is responding with copy pasted refuse.
---
What a weird convo ^^
---
We dont 100% know that jalis is dead tho right?
---
Actually I'd really like the first sylvari one to by rianoc
---
Just because someone's from a "rich country" doesn't mean they themselves are rich. All our great wealth is hoarded by a few billionaires, it's not like the rest of us can all spend our money to "donate" games to people all willy-nilly. If you think everyone in America or Europe is sitting on a mountain of cash then boy oh boy I'd love to see you come over here and get a wake up call
---
Same! I've been intending to finish that place up anyway, and this was a nice excuse to get it done! It was a lot of fun (though admittedly would have been more frustrating with fewer people around at the time, I think.
---
They tried before, the [flamekissed](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Flamekissed_Light_Armor_Skin), [flamewrath](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Flamewrath_Heavy_Armor_Skin) and [flamewalker](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Flamewalker_Medium_Armor_Skin) armor sets were all reskins of human cultural armor and the shitstorm that occured for letting other races basically wear human cultural armor was real. 
---
I doubt they'll try that again, sadly.
---
Well ofc over all the Crafting Professions. Well and there are certain recipes which nets you a Profit. And if you do all of them and sell stuff u net a good amount of Gold.
---
Ofc im changing my Crafting rotations on the Markets demand/supply to always net the best Profit/Time. But on avg my Profit per day is around 80-100g
---
Dragonsblood weapons make me sad.  Specifically, the account wide limit on Branded Mass nodes makes me sad.  Doing the meta and seeing zero nodes pop is an immediate Despacito.
---
To people who have built up a collection:  beyond rotating all my 80‚Äôs thru the hearts and buying 20/toon/day, is there another secret way to farm up the Masses?  Or is it just a matter of waiting and waiting?
---
Zinn! I knew I was missing somebody! That said, Arkk would be an interesting idea, for sure.
---
Oooh. For Norn, Jora would be a fantastic Legend. We're a bit short on ladies (4 dudes, two ladies), and Jora was awesome.
---
&gt;a small patch
---
I agree with you that it would be great if took a look the hats.
---
But it's a lot harder than it sounds.
---
Maybe ask /r/guildwarsgonewild ;)
---
I insulted your post? and what about people you insulted calling them piece of shit etc? who is asshole here?
---
Both of us let‚Äôs be real
---
Yeah one of those is causing the troible with Akili, or at least its located right where he spazzes out. And the prompt only appears while on a Skimmer. Quite amusing how stuff like this even happens - and infuriating if it blocks progress ^///saltyrant
---
It applies to the final damage dealt to enemies when you actually use the skill. It doesn't show in the description. If you hit an enemy with a skill that does 100 bleeding damage per second, with those runes it would instead do 107 bleeding damage per second.
---
1000 gems for this "emote" for springer. ANet, your turn.
---
:o so why are you trying to take his rightfully earned karma?! lol
---
Except on Asura.  
---
I'm sporting a [Black Mage](https://i.imgur.com/jgp0ofU.jpg) look on there.

If you want the discord conversation of me asking him for consent in posting this I will send it to you
---
It is also a good idea if you want the acheavement for it anyways.
---
Crotch Inspector in the background.
---
I wish I could forget about it.  There's some things about people's personal lives that are better left unknown.
---
If you plan to do any ascended or legendary crafting:
---
Spool of Silk Weaving Thread
---
Spool of Thick Elonian Cord
---
Lump of Mithrillium
---
Glob of Elder Spirit Residue
---
Charged Quartz Crystal
---
Now i feel bad for only giving the person 20g that helped me.
---
1. sigils go in weapons runes go in armor you can have 6 runes at ones (one per armor piece) and you gett most out of your runes if all 6 are the same
---
2. no
---
3. what system?
---
4. all the same (some rare exceptions)
---
I'm.. I'm seeing lips.
---
off limits to the gem store:
---
\-weapons/armor already in game
---
\-animated bodies / sounds of main characters.
---
Why isn't this comment filled with entitled mesmer and stingy assholes? Like I would expect atleast one guy to say "well I expect to be tipped but I will never tip that's just stupid"
---
idk, I was pretty indifferent toward Trahearne and that's in between.
---
So normal guild banners are all supposed to last for 30 min but like you said I'm pretty sure I've seen the normal ones last much longer than that but can't confirm for sure. I know a lot of WvWs swear they last 1hr+ at least. The hero banners have a "bug" that they go away as soon as the person that placed the banner leaves (logs out etc).
---
I particularly love trying to figure out which squad I'm in. It's a game within the game!
---
Wat?
---
This. My bald looks great with it. Every other character, not so much. This would be really awesome.
---
Obviously it was very bad for gameplay, but I think it made for some very fun situations and conversations for the group. It also became quite in icon if you look at fan art, gifts for Laura, merchandise, easter eggs etc.
---
I guess it might be disliked more by people who are very into the the game itself, but loved by people who simply watch the show.
---
These jokesters are the real joy of Gw2, be damned the cheers for helpfulness (tho that be quite excellent as well). 
---
Whenever Ive logged in on my alt 'Walmart Beggar' players showered me in the most stupid junk.
---
What everybody else said is correct, but it also means you can add key combinations to it and it'll be completely fine.
---
mouse button 3 for 1st skill, ctrl+mb3 for 2nd skill, shift+mb3 for 3rd skill etc.
---
Gandara EU , waypoints guarantee, 0 stress on open tags, AC Master title included up on clicking \*ok\* to the transfer message . The transfer comes with 500 (2 stacks ) of Superior siege of any kind (Acs, Balista , Rams, ... )
---
You will have to wait, sorry.
---
1) So you see how on a superior rune, there's 6 different bonuses that they can give? The bonuses that you receive are based around how many copies of each rune you have. Each armor piece can take one rune, so if you want a full set of bonuses, each piece of your armor needs to have a copy of the same rune. 
---
Take superior rune of the scholar
---
The bonuses are
---
Number of Copies | Bonus | Total Bonus
---
----------------|-----|-----------
---
1 | 25 power | 25 power
---
2 | 35 ferocity | 25 power + 35 ferocity
---
3 | 50 power | 75 power + 35 ferocity 
---
4 | 65 ferocity | 75 power + 100 ferocity
---
5 | 100 power | 175 power + 100 ferocity
---
6 | 125 ferocity, increase damage by 5% while your health is above 90%  | 175 power + 225 ferocity, increase damage by 5% while your health is above 90% 
---
So when you only have 2 copies of the runes, you only get up 25 power and 35 ferocity, but 4 copies gets you 175 power and 100 ferocity
---
2) yes, but you lose the sigil/rune every time you swap stats
---
3) ?
---
4) generally all the same
---
5) for damage: renegade and soulbeast
---

---
6) eh, I'd rather just gamble 4 exotics together and use mystic forge stones to make salvage kits
---
7) up to you. Weapons tend to be easier I believe, while the trinkets take quite a bit of work completing living world maps.
---
I hope one day that you will find true love... and a therapist. And someone that tells you that 66% is still a majority. But you can try to create as many throwaway accounts to keep it like that. Hope you don't have a full time job.
---
Not all tipping is obligatory. Sometimes it's just a little something to return the favor done to you.
---
Ssssaaaltyyyy
---
I was tipped a couple times for porting to skyscales but I sent it back.  I never tip unless someone is expecting to do something for tips.
---
I'm sitting on a ton of spirit shards myself but found that the grind associated with monetizing them is too daunting. Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but when I calculated how much gold I could make versus the RL time it would take, I was making far short of minimum wage.   
---
Am I doing it wrong, or is it simply a matter of grind and patience to monetize shards?
---
It's so fast yeah. It made PoF masteries waaaaay too easy compared to HoT, especially with the insanely low experience requirements. I literally finished all of them in a single day after I gathered the mastery points in about 2 due to this, which made me have no long term goal altogether.
---
OK
---
I usually tip 1-5g for a typical jump puzzle port. If someone helps with a particularly annoying thing I dont feel like doing they get more. The guy who let me wp to him for the skyscale of ice achievement got 50g because that's time I didn't have to waste and was lagging too hard to try by myself
---
The wonderful mesmer who was portalling people in Chalice of Tears just to be a good person, and when asked helped me get the coins got 300g. I had been trying for 2 hours and just could not get it for some reason
---
I must have missed something;  Where do you get the third trinket from?  Is it the legendary backpiece with aurora and vision?
---
No the reason the dwarves are stone is because they incited the Rite of the Great Dwarf so they can continue the fight against the destroyers.
---
Same. I left few griffon adventures on purpose just for that. By doing it for the first time you get bonus xp from chests as well
---
Thanks for your info sounds grear!
---
I don't know if this is relevant or not but I accidenta√∂y bought a extra bag slot for 400 gems and when I contacted support they said that they could not remove rhe bag slot and refund me, but they refunded the gems and I got to keep the bag slot :)
---
Someone is in need of a meat tornado.
---
Joining a guild and relying on multiple people rather than just one is a good way of keeping interesting in the game and it opens up many other opportunities should you wish to try out some group content or even WvW.
---
Absolutely nothing. If you tip even 1g for a home instance you just wasted your own time harvesting materials you could have bought with that one gold.
---
Probably the Noble Count outfit would be the best if you can't use human light cultural.
---
remind me please!
---
you don't debate hate. hate's not rational
---
I think I maxed mine out while doing a regular weekly clear of Wing 5 and Wing 6.
---
Haha I gave in and actually asked him how many people had. He said it was quite a few.
---
&gt; Is there a way for me to use them to get the package now...
---
the items like the branded bp/glider, ironbeast GS, Hydra staff etc get rotated for purchase with BL statuettes. Afaik when there is a update to stuff from BL chest the statues get updated at the same time. FYI it will probably be 60 statues to by when it does come around in a couple months.
---
Seems the legendary trinket effect is lost if you die? You either have to requip both trinkets or change maps to get it back.
---
I'm not sure if you're talking about unnecessary invisible walls that were added to counter mounts, sloppy extensions of walls at the edges of maps, or sloppy invisible walls that were always in the game. I'd say only the first is relevant.
---
Not a SS problem, but a mount problem.
---
Strong as dps in pve (holo), as bunker/bruiser (scraper/holo) in pvp+wvw roaming and as support (scrapper) in large scale wvw.
---
Ah, I guess the griffon felt way slower compared to running on foot because of its size, my bad. Still way slower than the 2 main travel mounts, raptor and jackal, so when running in a flat area there really is no reason to not use them. When it flies (as I saw in the post you linked) the griffon is a bit faster, but still not faster than those 2 with their skills.  
---
BTW, I had no idea the maximum speed you can get with the griffon is the highest of all, even more than the beetle. It makes sense though, because I run into trees so easily when I'm using it. It feels amazing as well.
---
lol nice burn
---
I felt like Aurora was worth the cost, infusions and effects and auras in this game are very expensive so it seemed appropriate to me to shell that out for a unique, impressive and distinctive effect.
---
But Vision?  What the hell?  I don't know what they were thinking or why they think it's okay to release **the exact same trinket** again under a different name.  I understand that combined, Vision and Aurora have a new effect, but that's still not changing the fact that *Vision is the same as Aurora*.  Twilight and Dawn are good examples of the "same legendary" that, when combined, become a more enhanced version of themselves, but Twilight and Dawn at least have different effects and colors from each other.  
---
Seriously, they couldn't just open up photoshop, open up the texture, and slide hue over 30 points?? If they wanted us to be able to make Aurora more than once per account, then make a new way to get another gift.  Don't just make a copy of it and name it something different then pretend it's "new".  It's not new.  It's as if they said "we released a new legendary pistol!", and then it's just H.O.P.E with the same effects and skin, just renamed N.O.P.E.
---
I like the combined effect idea, but making Vision the same as Aurora was the height of laziness.
---
* Disgustingly hard to kill in PvP. 
---
* Quite good at healing. 
---
* Deal great dps if you can play piano. 
---
* Deal great condi dps if you can play piano even better.  
---
But you need expansions to be able to do 3 of 4 of those.
---
A lot of competitive wvw guilds server hop pretty often. So you can be on a huge, active server for several months, a few major guilds start talking about leaving for fights in a different tier, word spreads to other guilds, half the other guilds decide to leave, too.
---
I miss my old wvw guild but I was tired of saving up all my gold for things just to have to spend it to follow them to new servers all the time. :(
---
Bloodstone rings and amulet are amazing for this, they're like "legendary lite" because the stat resetter is just 10 unbound magic.  If they made trinkets and a backpack for LS4 with the same ability, I think that would be a really good middle ground for people who want to stat swap without legendaries or tons of clutter in their bags.
---
Dwarves could already be a new race even in their stone form (if enough have survived at least, but I believe there's bound to be a few still kicking). 
---
The thing is that a new race itself is just extremely unlikely.
---
Bluntly, all classes are totally playable in solo and are fully capable to playing high level content, sure there are "meta" builds but those are aimed at efficiency rather than being able/enough to complete content.  The trinity (dps,healing,tanking) isn't classically a thing in GW2 (although that's a bit misleading) and engi is a solid class but requires quite a bit of kit swapping to be "optimal" which is not really required to be good at content.  If you want to look to the future as to what kind of builds are popular check out metabattle -&gt; [here](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Engineer) Currently there are nice niches for most engi builds.
---
My guild constantly teases me because I like Trahearne as well.  I honestly don't know where all the hate comes from, he was humble and didn't feel worthy of the calling he had, and yet in the end he succeeded and gave his life in doing so.
---
He was and still is one of my favorite characters.
---
Although that said I must have a thing for plants, I really like Canach as well. ;)
---
A matching set of 6 runes is a massive boost. Go on the trading post, type "superior rune" in the search box and filter it to exotic, then sort by cheapest and look at the descriptions. Go down until you find one that will work for your build (e.g. burning if you do fire damage, poison if poison etc, power and precision if thats what you want) and get six of them. 
---
Soulbeast has a good and easy shortbow build. 
---
The legendary weapon collections take a while but they're not hard. It's more about endurance than skill. If you do your daily crafting stuff and focus on the LS4 metas (to buy trophy shipments) it kind of pay for itself.
---
A lot of hats are like this. The swashbuckler hat is the only one I know of that actually has hair, and is thus usable. Why even make hats if it turns the character bald? It looks absurd in nearly every case.
---
Same thing with Witch's Hat. I'd love to use it but I'd also love to not be bald.
---
Hi there, glad you could pick it up again.
---
Try to pick up the expansions when they are on sale again, if you like the core game you will have a blast with the add ons. The story gets way better there and the maps get new twists so you get a completly new exploration feeling.
---
I remember one time years back when I gifted this person 300g for a commander tag. Shortly after they began asking for more so they could get a legendary.  
---
I also had a friend who needed gold for a transfer, so I donated enough to do so. Had more than a few conversations the weeks following where it was blatantly obvious they were hinting at wanting me to buy them other things.  
---
And yet another person learned I had gifted a friend an outfit from the gemstore. Never spoke to this other person one on one before, only in parties with other friends. After like 30 seconds of talking they begin mentioning things they like in the gem store...  
---
I love spoiling people I care about... And I love giving random strangers gifts depending on the context (eg. they're discussing expansions in /map and how they don't have it or something)... But every now and then you get people who don't appreciate generosity and it's just depressing. I don't care about what I lost, it just makes me sad they don't know how to appreciate it.
---
I think your camera had a seizure.
---
Yeah so we let clickbait BS be a thing here eh?
---
Revenants do not channel *actual spirits* from the mists.  They channel the *echoes* of those spirits.  "Copies" of them, if you will.  These echoes manifest where the entity in question has performed an action that has had some sort of significant impact on that region.  Revenants collect these echoes, communing with them and manifesting these events as skills.  This is how Revenants build an invoked Legend.
---
If you are not in a hurry you might want to wait and see what amd has to offer soon, once they release new ryzens. 
---
You will need to change your ram anyway, because your current ram is DDR3 and new board will be using DDR4. So if you are on a tight budget 8gb might be the thing for you. 
---
and air cooling is more than enough if you don't overclock.
---
Hands down one of the best realistic female armor I've seen in RPGs over the years, if not the very best.
---
Place the banner, then die (can just jump off of a cliff). waypoint out of the zone and the banner should stay there until that instance dies from nobody being on it. It doesn't seem to work with hero banners. Only the double bonus and single bonus ones.
---
Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt.
---
You could also do 3-4 raid bosses and be done :)
---
Gw2efficiency.com will (now) automatically track the daily ecto crafts and charged quartz. If you‚Äôre not using it, ya should be.
---
Just because its useless to you doesnt mean it's useless to others. I dont like titanfall therefore you cant play it.
---
Also dont equate this to killing people, wtf is wrong with you.
---
Any time I get someone asking for handouts like this I'll just ask them how much gold they need and send them an equivalent amount in Gold Ore.  
---
And if they happen to say "that's not what I meant", I'll then reply with "well then you better get working because that gold won't turn in to cash by itself."
---
Some comms just bought the tag for the power trip. Just try any multimap - read the wording of the RULES (always in caps, always worded by someone with a... thing for being in charge and demanding absolute obedience) and then try jumping directly to another group without going by way of lobby. See HOW FAST you get kicked. 
---
Sure, you broke the rules, but the usual response time shows said comm is more interested in watching and policing players than do what the group is intended for.
---
Yeah, some people act like we didn't jump the shark years ago already.
---
Just go to WvW, where running a huge radioactive charr stopped being a meme years ago to just become the norm.
---
Oh, you specifically are in Chechnya right now being persecuted for your sexuality? the same Chechnya being condemned world wide for its shitty practices? That has Canada giving the LGBT people there Asylum? If so my condolences, you're still an asshole, a persecuted asshole, but an asshole none the less. In that situation. If the answer is no, then there wasn't a point of you linking me that, because I was specifically referring to you, and not the LGBT collective as a whole, so the whole "We're all still persecuted shtick" doesn't work.
---
## #NOTMYPARADE ## #CENSORSHIP ## #TRUTH CANT BE SILENCED ## #GO WOKE GET BROKE ## #STILL KEEPING THAT RATIO ON 66%,PRICE OF FREEDOM IS HIGH,BUT WE WILL HOLD THE LINE!!!
---
Never tipped the hosts, all 5 times i used them. Also never used portal shortcuts, never expected my portal, or any other activity being tipped, got tipped couple of times, never would refuse a tip - i think its rude, but i would not tip myself, esp. when they say "tips are welcome", have done lots of donations, gifts and help all around (guilds, gear, ar infusions, bags etc.) but no tips, no.
---
It drives me crazy that Taimi, Braham and Gorrick get so much screen time while Trahearne gets so little (also makes me sad they went with Eir's funeral instead of a massive moment for the founder of the Pact, the real hope for Tyria's future long before Aurene).
---
Trahearne is literally the first of his kind, a brand new race to walk Tyria, a race full of people to accomplish great things. The story did no justice to Trahearne, the Pact, the sylvari race and the world by dropping him in the rubbish in HoT.
---
I tip 1g for JP ports. Some ppl accept it, others just send it back.
---
considering this guy can't even speak in real sentences, I would try again.  Hopefully you get a GM who knows what they are doing.
---
Where is my mithril
---
I... I think I need a shower.
---
It would look far more uglier than what you think, but still, the solution is quite simple: Make a few new hat-friendly hairstyles, establish a boundary, and make sure hair-friendly hats respect it from now on.
---
Ideally, the hairstyle system should get an update to allow cheaper customization, else this change would be pointless in the long run if you have to pay gems for a new hairstyle every time you swap your hat.
---
if that's a copy/pasted reply, that is especially sad because the very first line is all fucked up/not english.
---
As support scrapper they are top tier for WvW, for PvE not as much. Holos are still in the upper  regions for dps, esp. if you need vulnerability if you dont have a druid with storm spirit.
---
Ah! You‚Äôll get more gold more easily the longer you play. Fractals alone give a decent chunk.
---
I really love the idea of Balthazar but, Razah would be even better.
---
&gt; Deal great dps if you can play piano.
---
Any power holo build is really easy.
---
&gt; and a massive shitstorm for letting other races use human cultural armor occured. 
---
The shitstorm was more due to the fact they were shamelessly recycling already existing armor sets.
---
Those were other times, of course, and the community had higher standards. Now we don't even bat an eye about shameless recolors and reskins :(.
---
sigh nvm, i have 2 more months in this game before im forced to quit this game for 3 years... so its either the rifle skin comes soon or i'll need to farm  [The Predator](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Predator)
---
Also stop giving the Caithe NPC the goddamn toxic/verdant daggers when she has daggers of her own! I really hate when NPCs are wielding the wrong weapons, and it keeps happening all the time.
---
Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of their tips.
---
thanks for the answer, like i mentioned im not looking for ultra high settings, but ill wait to see if the release of the new ryzen lowers the price of the older models even more. that seems to do for the proccesor then, but what about the RX 580?
---
I am split on the legendary trinket design. On one hand it is a good way to make sure you can stack them without turning into a living rainbow. On the other hand we lack alternatives for the people that dont like it...
---
#oldschoolcool
---
But are LGBTQ+ people "bad stuff"? I don't buy that analogy, I'm afraid.
---
Please... learn the lore at least... &gt;.&lt;
---
Which ones?
---
The skyscale thing like all the way up the zig zag floating pillars above the wall in blazeridge that you have to springer up? I tipped like 5 gold to the mesmer porting for that, springers have the fine motor control of sledgehammers.
---
Lmao, I was asking the same thing in LA
---
...there are griffon races? o.O
---
I mean some other specs like DD and Holo are a bit loose canonically for their intro as well.  Caladbolg also had Riannoc who is a short-time before GW2.  Could be represented by a silhoutted Trahearne until after HoT.
---
Well whose fault is it you're so efficient? You can always drag it out to "have a longer term goal"

Top 10 üëà most beautiful in game mail üëâunboxing. üëâ Number 3 will shock you! üëâ‚≠ïüëà MY REACTION üò±üëà

‚ÄúPlay a class that runs fast and has mobility...‚Äù

Deviously evil.
---
There's some cliffsides the Skyscale is superior for - basically anything with a sheer face you can latch/recharge on, with a ledge out of the Springer's jump range.
---
Otherwise, if the Springer can handle it I use the Springer instead, as it's much, much faster.
---
It's like that in real life also.
---
not worth it, just join other's home instance

it will take 4-5k gold i think
---
You had me at meat tornado.
---
What's the green mechanic?
---
50s to 1 gold, depending on how "difficult" the JP is and how lazy i feel.
---
Yeah, I'm just gonna be patient. I might get them sooner, but it depends what life throws at me, y'know? Can't wait to do all that new exploring too.
---
Imagine if some religious conservatives decided to hold an ingame event, where they talk about the negative social impact of revealing outfits, violence in videogames leading to school shootings, vaccines being evil, the earth being flat, and other stuff like that.
---
There's a reason why a lot of us want politics/religion/sports out of our videogames. All of them, with no exception. The game shouldn't become a platform for anything, it should be a place where we can have fun and forget our outside problems, period.
---
Very true, tho I think that still would create the issue that I'm talking about; assuming that getting so-called end-game stuff (i.e., the griffon) would put you in a position where you wouldn't be completely overwhelmed.
---
If you want I can show you, I‚Äôm online from now on for the next couple hours :)

I had a warrior named GodOfBoy that looks like Kratos from the newest god of war game. It was suppose to be a [joke about how much Kratos says boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n12Q2Pj9ESg) in the new game. While I was leveling through a new zone, someone PM'd me about how I should be ashamed for my name and how much of a monster I was. He went on for 5 minutes about how much of a creep I am and how he had reported my name to the internet predator hotline or something.
---
After his rant, I explained the joke and he apologized for it. That's fine, cool that he understood, right? Nope. He went on another rant about how no one accepts him and he wants to kill himself. I told him I couldn't help him with that, told him he needed to call the suicide hotline if he was serious, and that I'm just trying to enjoy a new gaming experience by myself. He went on for a few more minutes before I ended up blocking him and reporting him for self harm so maybe a GM would notify his local P.D.
---
Idk why a stranger would lay into me like that over a silly name and then continue to harass me afterwards, this is why I don't "do" people.
---
Well she was a genuine prodigy by and large for a sylvari.  Arguably she could draw from a buff-debuff traps / gadgets / wells sort of interaction and I'm all for giving Rev versatility.
---
If Blade &amp; Soul could do it, then so can GW2. C'mon anet. I want to be able to at least attempt to recreate my force master on here. https://puu.sh/xa2rx.png
---
Very strange, in all the years I played I never really had bad experiences unless in sPvP.   
---
I came back after a 1 year break and the first thing I see in WvW is someone recruiting for their guild and instantly getting flamed by some other guy. That was going on for about 20 minutes. I reported both of them for spamming cause they couldn't stop stating their respective playstyle was better and the other would be the noob.   
---
Disgusting.
---
Those are political issues. A group of liberals arguing for universal health care, abortion rights, or pro-immigration policies in game would be equally political.
---
The existence of LGBTQ+ people simple isn't a political issue. It's a fact. Not only on Earth, but in Tyria also. And no matter how strongly someone might wish they didn't exist, they do.
---
I'm also troubled by your implication that the existence of LGBTQ+ people are an "outside problem." Why should they be a problem?
---
The shiverpeak (not the dredge one) and elonian maps are my favorite.
---
Timberland falls is so peaceful. Bitterfrost frontier feels so chill!
---
Desert scenery is great.
---
Just another example of how poorly Anet polishes this game.
---
Personally I'm relieved that the post was about an amusing joke and not sappy and real.
---
I was in a ranked PvP match this season and it was one of the ones where if you kill the enemy lord you get a large amount of points which usually wins you the game if your score is high enough. I went in for a solo clear out of the smaller mobs and succeeded on taking them all out, only to have this scrapper (who‚Äôs name I forget so I‚Äôll call him Edgelord.) take me out with what little health I had left from my suicide mission. 
---
Edgelord starts dancing on top of my corpse and whispers ‚Äúhah noob.‚Äù To me, so I take the bait and whisper back, ‚Äúmy team is ahead of you and when I respawn I‚Äôm going to kill your lord.‚Äù I get no response, I see him again and this time I‚Äôm at full health so I switch from my defensive set over to my greatsword and bash his face in, I make a bee line for the enemy lord, dispatch the enemy lord and with what last shred of health o have left I put the nail in the coffin bringing victory to my team. He whispers me again ‚Äústupid noob.‚Äù So I whisper back ‚Äúyeah, a noob that beat you, killed your lord, and won the match. GG, you lost to a noob.‚Äù No response again. 
---
Two games later it‚Äôs me vs a team with him in it again, overall it was a neck and neck game, nothing too noteworthy happened except that I killed him a couple times and he got me once, then the match ended and the enemy team won. I land back at the PvP lobby, start opening up my gear. He whispers me ‚ÄúHaha stupid bitch, I win.‚Äù I whisper back, ‚Äúwow, how very sportsmanly, I‚Äôm sure your parents would be very proud.‚Äù Only to get the message telling me that the player didn‚Äôt receive my message because I had been blocked. 
---
Dude has a seriously fragile ego.
---
How do these even compare? You have toons of weapon choices, most even better than those presented, while no other trinkets have effects
---
B O I
---
I report people for going AFK all the time during PvP whether it‚Äôs my team or the enemy team, because that‚Äôs not cool. I‚Äôve yet to see anything happen to those people though, you PvP long enough, you start to see some of the same faces.
---
[Exactly](https://i.imgur.com/0ljCWpl.png)
---
I really wish they would redo dual pistols to be more dps focused without a lot of swapping. It would be cool to focus turrets or drones and mash pistol abilities. That's my fantasy, at least.
---
Beatrice, is that you?
---
If you're looking to make back your gold, it would take you a very, very long time. It would cost around 6k gold to max your home instance. While it's not profitable, I enjoy collecting the home nodes for completionist purposes. And it makes some dailies really quick (miner, lumberer, forager).
---
If you got some time now, hit me up in game, on Vayne.8563. I can explain all this stuff to you.  Would help if you have discord, but I can do it in text real time while linking stuff.
---
which achievements have timegates on them?
---
Anyone know where I can look to find out?
---
Dont wanna be surprised anymore like the Hedge armor piece that was required for the legendary trinket

That'd be great, thanks :D
---
Tookit engi in WvW is some of the most fun I've had with PvP. Magnet pulling poor souls out of their zerg into your own, confusing them with the crowbar, and crippling them with your wrench while they desperately attempt to roll to safety has always been a favorite pasttime of mine.
---
Like a year ago I had Chaos Gun drop from a random mob in SW, my first ever precursor drop after like 5000+ hours, exclaimed it in map chat, some random guy said ‚Äúomg so lucky! Can I have it?‚Äù Not a legendary I want, so it‚Äôs just 100g to me, which is fairly easy for me to get, so I sent it to him. He thanked me, said I was a great guy, etc. A week later he asked me for free stuff twice. I told him NO both times and he went away, but it really soured the mood of the initial gift.

This music is spoopy

PvE:
---
Anything and Everything - depends on what you're looking to do specifically.
---
PvP:
---
Heavily role based. Do you want to be the big teamfight damage? Do you want to duel/1vX on side-nodes?  Do you prefer to roam/+1 fights? Do you want to support?
---
WvW:
---
Similar to PvP.
---
Truth be told, most classes have some viable setup to adjust themselves to different roles and tasks. You're only limited by your gear/trinkets depending on what you want to spec yourself to do.
---
you should check out r/buildapc, its a way better place to ask for pc building stuff.
---
Eh yes? Did i say you could not?
---
Can you donate me the expansion too, I'm poor as well.

Greens on Dhuum refers to a mechanic where you sacrifice your soul in place of a Reaper under Dhuum's Gaze, and then you collect orbs (souls) to return to your body. 
---
They activate on top of the reapers, meaning Jil was pointing the boss towards people who needed to be away from the group to do the greens. Downed bodies can't go up so, and missed greens = wipe
---
Also, popcorn. For map chat drama.
---
Target is not a sylvari
---
It was worth it for me, because I hate farming and I got it mostly for guildies. So many people farm my home instance every day at reset. Solo farming it once isn't really ever going to pay for itself.
---
But it's a way of farming without farming, so there's that. It's been a pretty decent convenience for me.
---
do you have a spot for me everyday? would be much appricated
---
Thank you! 
---
This is exactly what I was looking for. It looks pretty cool,  I think I might keep it.
---
Mostly I do it for guildies, but if you're around when we're doing it, I could probably fit you in. We do it around reset. Hit me up in game on Vayne.8563

cool, ty

For me aesthetics went to shit the day they introduced [those damn flappy wings](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Holographic_Dragon_Wings)
---
Gotta be liberal with those blocks. Legit it has changed my experience of this game for the better ten fold. The ability to block users allows you to essentially customize your chat experience. The only measure of control you can exert over these individuals is to block them, and in doing so you free yourself from their parasitic nature.

Like they say, misery loves company. Deny them that.

Other side of this. I often portal people (most recently for certain Skyscale JPS - looking at you Griffonrook).

The majority of people tip nothing, some people tip 1g, and I have received 5g on one or two occasions. I never ask for tips.

Offhand horn that also put you in combat if you were close to any enemy or even critters yes. Also utility but i guess we don't use it.
---
So if we use only weapons: you had 1 option to get swiftness which also put you in combat frequently vs swiftness which you could easily use without being in combat as guard none is 100% uptime and similarly running. However since we are using weapons, guard had mobility skills and necro did not so lost there.
---
If we are using utilities, you got signet as necro and perma swiftness as guard which beats signet and also mobility skills which again beat necro.

Did you even play the game back then? Nobody that played both classes back then would argue otherwise.

I personally love the Jackal for its maneuverability in places with hard turns, like at the bottom of canyons, caves or other stuff like that.
---
Well, if you're planning on playing for years...

Good troll by telling him to play necro, the slowest class in the game lol
