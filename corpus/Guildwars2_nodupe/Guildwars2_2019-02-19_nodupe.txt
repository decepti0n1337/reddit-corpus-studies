I've played through all of it except on one character but that is because that one was created relatively recently and I have been distracted by other things. On the other hand I am just checking off boxes.
---
---
---
i played ultima online for 3 years, where when you died, you lost your gear, and people would take your house if you didnt paly for a bit.
---

---
I understand theres progression, but it isnt needed to enjoy an MMO necessarily.
---
I'm a veteran player who is slowly chipping away at legendary armour because it was one of the very few worthwhile things I had yet to do. Once I'm done I don't know what else I'd even do. 
---
Something, anything to add replay to the game is welcome. At this point in time I've been bored for 2 years and chipping away at legendary armour for 1.
---
Well except there's a lot of elder dragons remaining.
---
In your opinion, in mine and most of those who I play with they badly need a new engine. Assets sure they could re-use.
---
And epi. Clears shards even with 0 condition damage thanks to 25 might. Condi bs + condi dps required though.
---
Actually yeah, good point. That could help at least a little.
---
A reversion to GW1 style build creation and maybe even instancing could make those assets seem fresh.
---
Yeah, they could do with trickling it out a bit. That would give them a little more time for nuances. If we take the example of Sunswept, the Olmakhan area is of decent size. It's got some bosses, its own good meta, bounties, opportunity for a bit more lore surrounding the Olmakhan. 
---
So players would learn the meta for that area, then the new one when that comes along, rather than scrambling to complete all the new content at once. They could have had the bag collection for that small area and the robot backpiece collection for the larger area.
---
They were doing fine, the problem is they were temporary and they just deleted them once the 2-4 weeks were over. Some of the game's best MMO content came with LW1.
---
I can't even imagine how such an incredibly imbecile idea was even considered for approval. Had LW1 been permanent, using new maps instead of updates to the old ones, GW2 would be a very different game today, far more popular and profitable.
---
I don't think they'd take the story from one MMO into another MMO. That seems absurd to me.
---
I agree. Most of my ingame friends, no i think all of my ingame friends are already gone not long after LS4E2 was released. My IRL friends quit from PoF, And i myself have not even log in for the login rewards for 2 weeks. Clicking the game icon just doesnt feel exciting anymore.
---
At this point, im not even sure why im still here in this sub. Probably just waiting for updates and the comic memes.
---
Quaggans were fine at release. Then they turned into a meme and ArenaNet followed suit. Same happened with skritt.
---
OOOOOO, we used to run fractals every other day for months but we stopped. Yeah cause you got tired of it. Nothing is worth repeating that many times. There are still tons of other ways you can enjoy the game. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Like this game has been out long enough that you should realize that the easiest way to enjoy this game is in short bursts. If GW2 can survive an actual content drought with the pre season 2 and then pre HoT days, then it will still retain enough players now, especially now that each LW episode has been of a higher quality than the last gameplay wise. 
---
There are enough old maps that people can go to farm for the items they want, you don't need all the maps to offer all the rewards. You can farm berries for trinkets and backpack, while farming Istaan or SW or AB for gold. Better yet you can spvp your heart out and get gold and mats that you need to make your legendary armor set by converting the pvp ascended armor to legendary. 
---
Agree with you about the state of WvW though.
---
Thanks. Was wondering why I could hear this picture.
---
Stop blaming the community for the mistakes of the company.
---
You can tell we're in the lull between updates cause it's barely a month since the last episode and this reddit is flaring with THIS GAME IS DYING RIGHT???? THEY'RE MAKING GUILD WARS 3 RIGHT NOW RIGHT?????
---
in general, try taking a peek at /r/guildrecruitment, you might be able to find a guild that will welcome you in.
---
As long as you keep replying my buddy, it takes two after all. 
---
Making Norn a playable race changed all that. They're still loud, but they aren't the fiercely nomadic giants they used to be. They have to join orders and pacts, and have to do what Trahearne says without kicking him in the throat, and have to "save" the world with cooperation of other races, etc, etc. They had to get neutered so Norn characters could go through the same story chapters without it getting too weird, so now they're basically just bigger humans with silly costume skills.
---
They still have their nasty tempers, but don't necessarily have the means to act on their anger now. And anger without action is mostly just whining. Hopefully that peaked with the Brahamgasm, though.
---
Yeah. While in PvP and WvW it should revert to normal, and there should be a way to be able cancel the rebirth and give up the challenge midway. 
---
I don't know about fractals, since it's PvE and people can have other characters to play there, but maybe the rebirth could be like the beta characters, a copy of the character without affecting the original, and you'd get a limited number of rebirth slots.
---
&gt; 2 ranged power dps for the shards. I need suggestions here, maybe deadeye or staff weaver?  
---
when do pugs learn that you can just leap right into those shards and kill them of quick in melee.  
---
may not be the most optimal way. but if shit hits the fan, you need to clear, you do pug strat and whatever....just fucking do it.  
---
doesn't kill you, shards are cleared, tank can pull...you don't need any "ranged" or whatever shardclear. just fucking MELEE.
---
Suggesting people are gaming the system in a thread full of people who are admitting that they're gaming the system *is* a pretty outrageous thing for me to do, I admit.
---
Perhaps my wording was a little on the harsh side. You can search around in the archived forums; years ago a dev or one of the higher ups posted a short comment on the topic which basically meant that they're shifting their focus on working on the product - less talk implying they'd rather not disappoint the players if they hyped it all up only to have problems much later into development and let everyone down by scrapping things entirely or the outcome being vastly different to player expectation.
---
You are right (too long implementation) and I stand by my comment earlier, too little too late. Half the stuff they released in later years should've been done around launch/1 year max after.
---
What's DIE's guild leaders name? You'd be cool with me sending him this convo, right?
---
You basically need to kill monsters to get their skills.
---
There's barely any gear treadmills, max level is fast to get to, and the best armor isn't too expensive to get. You might spend a bit more of money here and there with runes and sigils, but that's it.
---
Weapons can either be bought or acquired through loot, each boss having special weapons with a specific combination of stats and upgrades, which you could farm to gear up quickly.
---
The core of the game's progression was hunting skills, then making your own builds for every type of mission and boss.
---
This game was "dead" or "stale" from the get-go. By not having real progression they have an excuse for how little content is put out due to everything staying relevant.
---
This looks like work. I have enough work well... at work, you know. I play this game for RELAX.
---
Looks like very deep and customizable system 
---
&gt;i think that list sets the bar pretty low
---
&gt; Averaging around 20k dps on most bosses( If you can do this and mechanics most pugs really wont care about kp if the recognize you)
---
Choose one. 20k dps on most bosses is in no way a low bar to be set. I pug A LOT and by your definition 90% of all pugs would be worse than a beginner. Its an ok bar for pure dps golems like mo and cairn, but for most bosses you won't go anywhere near that as a beginner. 
---
Because the sales of the game are at its lowest in a while, and after S4 there won't be a new Expansion. The game is riddled with flaws that are slowly becoming more evident.
---
Society is very different now than it was in 1750.
---
The point of aesthetics as endgame is value. If the only thing you need to get the prettiest skins is farm gold or spend real money, then endgame aesthetics loses its point.
---
The moment there's no prestige on any aesthetics, and you have an overflow of easy to get skins, most people stop caring altogether about their appearance, and then what's left to do?
---
Things like the wardrobe and the mounts should be recycled for the new MMO, enabling day from day one.
---
Spam f1 x2 on one, third f1 and f3 on second wgile hitting f5 on self. Have to do that all in 5 seconds before the nuke. Timing is tight.
---
This is an excellent idea, and your visual representation is really good. If I were Anet, I'd look into this!
---
Early lunch for Konzu!
---
i don't wanna be rude to you since everybody else already was, but this is exactly why i dislike druids in fractals
---
they just stumble through, do stuff randomly, camp staff and act like they are god's gift to earth because they placed a spirit and pressed ca #432 and they're a **healer**
---
also you can't really teach fractal cm mechanics since besides not exploding the bomb or not sharing the green or whatever..it's just getting used to the 100% scripted aoe dancing pattern
---
Its not just teq, it's happening across the board. 
---
&gt; Is there a class that can remove conditions from 10 players?
---
Daredevil gets a stolen skill that cleanses all conditions from 10 targets, and can refresh it each 30 alacrityseconds.
---
It can run P/P on second weaponset for free for buttons. It also brings Basilisk Venom, which is 750 breakbar damage. 
---
Killing shards is trivial by simply Vaulting onto them and hitting them a few times, it works way better than trying to range them (just don't do that when you need to be protected by the bubble)
---
It's also superior to Deadeye in cleaving the white mantle and phantasms.
---
If you have CC issues and see a thief bringing Thieves Guild, ask them to replace it with Basilisk Venom, the skill does only very tiny damage, you save way more time by breaking that bar quickly.
---
Also, from experience, if tanked properly and shards are cleared, you barely need a healer, in fact we have finished it without any issues (except for lack of might) when our only healer - a druid - failed the gliding part. A good tank and shard clearing are the most important parts.  Meleeing the shards actually works very well, especially if you play a dps class where that's your best option.
---
Now in the oil meta... most profitable day ever...
---
USA, FL - 3 within last 2 hours
---
Even if you try to avoid condition classes, some conditions, such as confusion (converts to retaliation) will be present from whirling finishers in chronos' ethereal fields and similar random, almost insignificant sources
---
How about cutting down story instances instead? I would say those are far more useless than the actual maps.
---
It's on the table.
---
The answer is to change how they communicate not to have very little communication at all.
---
Yeah sure dude, send it to all of us. I'd like to read it all again
---
sure its actually quite easy because the bar is so incredibly low, it honestly takes nothing more than researching on your own the easier raid wings, looking up viable builds that are effective in this game mode. There are plenty of people in lfg that actually do take in people with very little kp that people can easily get in groups with. IF not then there are literally several discords  and training groups that do practice runs to get people feet wet. Regardless of whatever role you playing but for the sake of this i'll just focus on dps. if you honestly put in the effort 20k is really not that hard regardless if you think its reasonable for someone who only been autoattack spamming in living story missions till now, and even if its not giving a new player an actual goal for "good dps" is more beneficial than telling him that pulling 12k on holosmith is just fine and dandy. Just because a player is new to a game mode doesnt mean you have to coddle them every step of the way, crap like that actually prevents people from improving. The entry point for this game mode is so low if laughable but what actually prevents people from getting into it is the mindset that everyone should just break their backs trying to carry every single person that cant be bother to meet any sort of bare minimum level of commitment or competence. Most players hate being called out for playing like shit but if you cant handle that in any capacity when its actually true then there are raid sellers that will  give you the succ for the bucc. And before you mention how "well people usually ask for high kp for squads" no shit most people dont want to be bothered carrying 3-4 people. That doesnt mean there arent places that they cant learn raid wings from though.
---
Sure. Let me get that contact info.
---
This is a relaxing, chill, meme run. In a 100ess or full stack 250ess run, it's super stressful as a druid or a healer. More so with a present of a weaver. As you see i don't do water spirit cuz it's even more lazy healing. I don't like it. people just heal themselves with attacks, not much to do. But i had to switch to warhorn for combo field with my healing spring and shit. And this run i managed to fail all mechanics I've been preaching about. Lol. Not switching weapons or do much on my end cuz i was busy talking and I'm crappy at multi tasking. But whatever. It's sad but it is what it is. Idc what others said. I care about the result. I'm happy the people requested find it super helpful rather those silent 2 mins god tier players that they jump left and right and it's over before you know it. Now you see when you fail specific mechanics, what actually happens and how much damage it deals, etc etc. We had fun recording too and was surprised lots of people watched the stream live. So my DMs was a mess and i had to short reply people to stop so i could focus. But yea. In those high ess kp, people still make stupid mistakes and we wipe. I don't understand all the salt and i guess I'll never will. Lol
---
They have examples of LW maps that are successful already: Jahai Bluffs, Istan, Bitterfrost, even Silverwastes.
---
tbf a lot of pugs are really bad thats why you see people still doing ranged deimos. and even if you think its not a low bar its still a goal that they can have in mind so they will stop thinking are actually contributing anything worthwhile pulling 9k on Cairin
---
two good players
---
Don't ever call me a nothing in your life ever again or else I’ll get on my osrs acc and armadyl godsword &amp; granite maul special attack you into oblivion make you bow down as you drop your valuable items for me to pick up and laugh in your face as I see you in lumbridge castle gearless, in rags, killing the rats for gold begging for a teleport other to Varrock so you can walk to the grand exchange and beg higher levels like myself for gold so you can rebuild everything you lost to me. 
---
We will. When the community treats the devs in that company with the basic respect they deserve. 
---
This game died years ago
---
you dont need range dps for shards because any half competent player should be doing them anyway, bitch out your dps untill they do the one mechanics theyre responsible for
---
[removed]
---
Same. Seems to happen right when a metal is going to end
---
echo echoo
---
Thats an off hand twitter comment that has been criticised but I was talking more about an actual marketing campaign.
---
Sure bro, keep telling your delusional self that :D
---
If I was angry, I'd probably make a satirical post about yours. I know how to use my brain though, so I'm not going to do it to spare you the embarrassment ;)
---
You're not worth the effort dude, sorry :(
---
If I was angry, would I have thought that? Nope, I wouldn't be rational and just post without thinking. Oh wait, that's you :D
---
Hey there, this game is totally worth to play :D I also sent you a friend request on discord. I am living in GMT +7 atm so your morning will be my evening. I often do daily fractal T1-2 and world boss stuff from 7am to 10am according to EST timezone. If you wanna come along, feel free to let me know. Cheer!
---
I actually bought a couple character slots a couple months ago for elite specs inventory bloat.  I decided to level each character without tomes, play through the story chronologically, doing map completion on each map I pass through, and not use any mounts until I hit 80.  Currently level 75, doing level 70 story in Mt Maelstrom.
---
It is a shame they removed crafting areas in WvW... or was that PvP?
---
Pft, you think people would stop planting them directly under the target just because they COULD place them father out?
---
Well, it is true that a lot of "content" is dead - no matter where :-(
---
Maybe. Some think "it would be stupid not to" and some think "absolutely not, ArenaNet should make a new IP". Some are worried there will be too much repetition of the lore. Some think they won't be able to make the gameplay unique enough. Some want the game to be more like Guild Wars 1; some don't. Some just want the game to run at more than 40 fps on a $1,000 computer.
---
Guild Wars 2 was way more successful than Guild Wars 1, so it's realistic to expect it to be developed for longer.
---

---
I know some other people have posted both the text and the sound effect, though I'd include the one from Ocarina of Time.
---
Just speak out in a non toxic way if it bothers you too much. Chances are it would be heard. Exp Warriors can gauge the range well and know to not compete with conjure placements. 
---
Possibly but there's no real indication yet. They only made 2 because they had some ideas they wanted to implement that they couldn't do in 1. Maybe if they hit that wall again we'll start seeing some evidence for gw3, but so far we haven't seen anything
---
Lost Tequatl today because of this :( 
---
NA as well
---
&gt; Give my guild our WvW stats! Show me where we stack up in kills, defenses, captures, revives, etc to other guilds on our world and across all guilds in WvW (NA/EU). 
---
nty,  numbers add too much toxicity to any game/mode.  just fix the broken bs (powercreep, how things contest, rework toughness so it matters)
---
So more or less what Diablo does with their seasons? I wouldn't mind that. 
---
Adding mats and no gold causes the opposite problem: deflation.
---
I just can’t believe that is being over six years and we still don’t have new ranked pvp game modes such as battlegrounds or arenas...
---
Just when you thought broken sword 5 shadowsteps were bad, sword 3 comes knocking
---
Thread removed: Begging is not allowed.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Right, I meant that more figuratively than literally. Obviously killing Zhaitan is the end of the story quests, but it's certainly not "the end" of GW2 from the perspective of the vast majority of players.
---
Its a flute and I wont have anyone ruin my green ranger cosplay dreams.
---
I feel like the content delivery system is solid enough in GW2 (with living story and expansions) that moving on to GW3 would only split the player base and harm both games. 
---
MMOs aren't really the flavor of the month anymore. 
---
Mesmer/Derv is pretty broken in GW1
---
I mean in GW1, optimal team setup for General PvE/high end PvE is fitting as many Mesmers as you can into your party basically.
---
To expand on this, I was at work and trying to get the thought at quickly.  I meant this to be a hopeful post.  It really does suck when your close friends stop playing, but I believe you can find that again with a new group.  Don't give up, OP.  Lots of friendly folks out there.
---
Thank you :-)
---
Given that Aurene is blue, this would be more related to eye color than hair color, since (at least white) babies are born with blue eyes, then they (usually) change as they grow up.
---
Well because Anet's philosophy was not to plan anything in the future. It very much looked like they had no long term plan for LS1 until halfway through when they clumped all the alliances under Scarlet
---
It was honestlly one of the best world boss fights. It needed some degree of organization and knowledge to defeat it but wasn't too difficult, and wasn't a zergfest either like Teq or AB. 
---
Original LA had some spirit and personality. New concrete slab is FAR from anything with a personality. My favourite parts of LA are remants of the old LA
---
I don't care much about the Norn, but the shiverpeaks are by far the most gorgeous areas.
---
Well, some people stockpile them, some other(like me) who have 9 characters anf who change their looks constantly, I find them very scarce. 
---
It's a shame that they don't create this kind of content anymore. LS1 story wasn't great but the events were so much fun! Karka Event, Clockwork invasions, battle on the breachmaker, Queens jubilee, Marionette, tower of nightmares, to name a few... Those events are what made GW2 great and unique on the mmo market. A truly living world.
---
2012-2014 was the best time to be a GW2 player. The game has lost its charme since then. 
---
Oh my bad. Thanks for the clarification
---
My experience with heal scourge is that its amazing in bad groups. It doesnt bring unique boons, it doesnt bring overwhelming heals, it brings unbeatable amount of rezzing. In good groups, people dont really go down, so nobody cares if a class is really good at rezzing. But in a group of average or so players, you can spam your shroud 4 skill every 15ish seconds which pulls down players to you--already a massive benefit since there is a good chance they died in a poison puddle or something; then you can cast a traited WoB while you rez (with your mercy runes) to heal the group and fast rez a person; if you want to rez even faster, you drop the skill WoB, then rez and trigger trait WoB; and if multiple people go down, no problem, drop signet rez. Heal scourge can really force a bunch of inexperienced raiders through mechanics.
---
W2 in particular seems to be where scourge shines with pug groups. Sloth isnt hard, but people can go down quickly, and most times a regular member cant rez due to poison, heal scourge can--not to mention, you can load up enough CC break to almost solo break his bar every time it pops. Then for Mathias, again, people keep dying to mechanics[?], no problem, you force them alive--and again, you can nearly solo break the breakbar.
---
&gt; I feel like the content delivery system is solid enough in GW2
---
I feel the exact opposite. ~3.5 month wait for 2h single player story and new open world map that gets stale after about a week of playtime
---
6-7month wait for a single fractal with 1-2 easy bosses
---
9-10month wait for 3 raid bosses is nowhere close
---
No subestential PVP/WvW updates at all
---
Next expansion is still like 12-15+months away unless they change LS frequency.
---
A 1 clone CS allows you to use timewarp, tides of time, signet of inspiration, and well of action/recall inside it, depending on your usage of either mimic or double well.
---
She looks so happy. Now I’m daydreaming about fishing being in GW2
---
He's starting to craft, obviously. What else is he going to need it for? You can't just into a craft and start making level 62 items so he has to start from the beginning making his current level irrelevant to why he needs copper ore.
---
3440x1440 is a little more strenuous than typical 1440p. 
---
I have been running that res on a 970 since October, it’s not terrible unless you are in the places where it sucks for everyone, then you will be in the teens in framerate. Don’t pair it with a bad CPU. 
---
Turn the char model limit down as the other guy said. Instant fos boost. 
---
I will probably upgrade when the next gen of GPUs comes out, but I don’t regret jumping in now on ultrawide. 
---
Seriously, give this a try when you have a question like this. [GW2 Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page)
---
GW2 needs rewarding content period.
---
How adorable is this idea?
---
I loved, I did not know it needed a change so far.
---
Let me just fangirl for a bit.  Might be a little lengthy.
---
* Fractal progression is fairly logical, instabilities (as much as we complain) do keep things mildly interesting.
---
* T4 Fracs give solid liquid gold rewards
---
* Open world farming is a thing, and it's not as mindless as it is in other games. (I'd rather do metas than bash my face into a wall grinding mobs endlessly)
---
* LWS3 maps are still relevant because of ascended trinkets.
---
* Rewards are varied and fairly balanced between game modes and methods of play.
---
* Class variety - some classes/builds are overtuned, but I can pug T4's on a necro so I'm good.
---
* We have legendary armor for each game mode.  Granted, the skins aren't unique for WvW and PvP but at least they exist!
---
* Gliding feels still amazing, and I STILL get a kick out of flying around Bloodstone Fen with all the leylines and updrafts.
---
* Mounts are far and away the single biggest improvement Anet has made to this game, imo.  Each has their niche and use, and while the skins are all gem store, at least the mounds themselves aren't.
---
* You can trade gold for gems, and vice versa.
---
* The maps are lovely.  Just... lovely.  5k+ hours, and I'm still finding cool little things in the core maps and I have to marvel at the amount of work and love that went into some spaces that we rarely see.  That's not even talking about the depth and complexity of the HoT maps (perfect for gliding) or the open expanses of PoF (perfect for mounts).
---
* Dungeons still exist, and it's still possible to get groups.  Anet didn't completely backpedal on lowering the gold rewards, but at least they haven't been removed.
---
* Some WvW and PvP reward tracks make certain currencies and rewards (dungeons and LW maps) more accessible to those who aren't interested in PvE.
---
* Active combat.  In the fire?  Dodge that shit.
---
* You can heal yourself, at least a bit.  Everyone can res everyone.
---
* PvE maps are the bulk of the game, and they're actually PvE.  You don't have to worry about someone 50 levels higher than you coming along to ruin your day.  On that note:
---
   * We scale down in lower level areas, so while it's faceroll visiting lower level maps, we aren't ruining everything for everyone else.
---
   * Individualized loot tables.  You get what you get, and it's not effected by the guy standing next to you.
---
* Surprises for the newest players.  You think Guard is just for healing?  Guess again!  Think a clothy can't tank?  Guess again!  It's unique, and I love that.
---
* The Trinity exists, but isn't nearly as forced or prevalent as it is in other games.  You don't need a tank outside of raids, and while a healer makes T4's more comfy, they're not strictly necessary.  
---
* The bulk of end-game builds are still focused on gear you can get off the TP or from core sources.  I still adore the zerk meta, and you can get zerk gear so many places.  
---
* Elite specs feel like true progression for your characters, and each has it's place.
---
* Masteries.  Everything about this, really.  Level 80 is the cap, you just build up your account from there.  The fact that they take effort just makes them feel even more worth-while. 
---
* Race doesn't matter as far as build/class/effectiveness.  Racial skills are a cool idea, but I'm really glad they don't matter.  Charr mesmer?  Go for it.  Asura warrior?  Have fun!  Sylvari engineer?  Why not??
---
* I'm so glad the gem store is convenience and skins.  I'm in the camp of wanting more skins available via gameplay, but the game needs funded somehow and we don't have a subscription fee.
---
* Oh!  Giving boons or reviving helps get you participation for kills and events!  You can run a healing/support build and open world and since you're helping you still get credit.
---
I'm sure I've forgotten something, but I'm fully in love with this game.  Apologies for the novel of bullet points!
---
I'd like it if they just connected some of the old maps in the LS so I don't have to interrupt a story just to go help a friend in BSF or down in the RoF.  But apparently that makes me Satan.
---
As a counterargument, I'm glad to see that in the last few releases, anet are telling major parts of their story in the open world, allowing main characters to be experienced by those who are farming the map. Logan and Canach talk to you while you attack thunderhead keep, and rox and Braham have character-building things to say in the oil meta. 
---
It sucks that so much still relies on the instanced content, but it's a step in the right direction.
---
I very much agree with you. As someone with limited time to play in the evening  I already have my hands full with daily, winterberries, hot metas and doing whatever other bit of content I can manage to sneak in there. This just seems very very grindy in comparison. 
---
One of the best victory pose bug screens i've seen, well done!
---
-&gt; "The starter zones and the start of the 15-25 zones."
---
I hope not. They should improve this game instead. Add more meta events to new maps that are worth doing, revamp dungeons, revamp wardrobe system, improve old armor textures, add dye channels to weapons and back items, add build templates, add replayable LW season 1 to remove gaps in story. There, almost a new game but cheaper.
---
Why don't you do them every day? I mean you have a static that runs fractals every single day, you must have some decent experience on CMs. Even if you don't, just adapt your comps, I bet you'll be able to clear them every day with no issues.
---
Can't find copper ore? Wow, if you were looking for piles of Orichalcum I could sympathise more.  You can't move around in the starter maps without tripping over copper ore.  Take a short walk through the Wayfarer's Shiverpeaks, for instance.
---
They did mention in the stream last week that the announcement would not be on stream, it will be in another form
---
These days, two mobile dps/roaming carry is a better duo than support/teamfight really. Any combo of mirage/thief/rev/soulbeast is probably going to be a good choice.
---
I'd be surprised if GW3 isn't on mobile. Anybody in the industry can see the numbers are too big to ignore.
---
And frankly, I'd like that. Mobile badly needs an ambitious, idealistic developer to make a financially successful product that doesn't rely on predatory monetization.
---
Given ArenaNet's track record and culture, they'll likely do something very different from how mobile RPGs have been done before. I'm optimistic that ArenaNet will put out something that they feel can be platform-changing, and platform-defining, and away from predatory cash-grab practices that have thus far been associated with the platform.
---
Besides, there's every chance that a mobile-compliant GW3 could be multi-platform, and PC-compliant as well. Phantasy Star Online 2 was able to pull off a shared persistent world for different platform users, given ArenaNet's server expertise like their patent on server instances allowing for updates with no downtime, and the megaserver tech, I'd assume this would be within their means if they find it feasible and financially sound. 
---
I think we should distinguish the fact that the developers who develop non-arcade, persistent world, multi-player games for mobile are mostly cancer, and not the platform itself. Maybe what mobile has been lacking all these years is an ArenaNet.
---
Having said that, I'm producing and writing for a project that is currently in maintenance mode while the studio is developing its next flagship project. So yeah, the signs are all there that GW2 is being managed in a way where they can minimize manpower cost by templating as many concepts and features as they can.
---
I try to play it once a year. It's my favourite story content and the only thing where the stakes actually feel like they matter. The fact that it's building up hype for an expansion also makes it work. In my opinion, it did a much better job when it came to its writing and focus in comparison to Season 3. I'm not a big fan of the two maps, but I can stomach them thanks to the story.
---
Just pray they don’t buff marriage again......
---
It's not that hard. Try to bring someone along to speed things up?
---
youre acting as if having a post taken down means anything, no you really are just a bitch
---
I'm sorry to break it to you but Anet has been extremely out of touch since PoF and it is progressively getting worse. In terms of development I have given up on them and refuse to give them any more of my money until they return some form of transparancy or interaction with this community. 
---
I can imagine that people who constantly post their concerns and suggestions for this game, feel completely abandoned. I have small hopes that Anet can pull it back but I would not sit and wait for that. Dont get me wrong, gw2 has been a big part of my life as it may be/have been to yours.
---
While GW1 still got supported there were ~ monthly balance patches.
---
Perfect balance is impossible ofc, but it was pretty good. Meta also changed more often bc of this. GW2s meta is very stale.
---
Maybe their rank was the illusion all along!
---
I played since launch. 6k+ hours 15+ legendaries, fractal God and so on... 2 weeks ago I just stopped. I dont even bother to login for daily rewards anymore. Mobile gacha games are getting more updates than gw2....
---
Except this won't happen.
---
They have a habit of nerfing and then buffing at the same time to "balance" it out since people whine so much.
---
They hardly every do direct nerfs with no buffs, unless it's thief.
---
F6 will take screenshots for you and store them in your User/Documents/Guild Wars2 file.
---
Only you can prevent photos of computer screens. :\^)
---
Gw3 and they should revert back to gw1. Gw2 is trash 
---
Ok thanks, I didn’t know that
---
a more realistic prediction would be them nerfing something like scrapper or warrior rather than anything mesmer related
---
Heh not sure how it is now. Marriage might need more buffs. There were some who avoided registering because that would just result in paying more taxes.
---
Happy to inform!
---
It should smooth things up, but avg fps on your spec will be same or lower.
---
So, should I update my GPU or CPU for the mining? Heard gw2 is already CPU heavy for all the salt in pvp 
---
&gt; What the hell do you expect to accomplish by advocating for less new maps? You want to kill the game faster than it's already dying?
---
Uh, I want better-**quality** maps in turn? Larger, with far better event support and changing map states, slowly discovered throughout a season (or it changes in response to story events like Kessex did).
---
In other words, less maps yes, but with x-times the amount of development time gone into them.
---
&gt; The problem are the story instances, those are the ones eating most of the resources. Why don't you complain about Fahranur, Rata Primus, Glint's Lair, etc instead?
---
That's a good question. I mean not only are they a waste of dev resources, the story they tell with them is so incredibly charming and impactful that I already remember anything about it other than the very recent part, and even there only really the end.
---
Please no mindless x50 mob killing. That thing would try to kill the unique quest and event system this game has. That drove me away from some games in the end. XD
---
The way you want to play is the way bad players are made. If you go to the encounter first and have problems with people then you will only think about how to complete the encounter=how to carry those people. Suppose your dps isnt doing enough then you will still carry him because it cant be improved then and there. This makes new players have a habit of getting carried  or not understanding what is happening behind the scenes where say chrono is carrying their asses to just get it over with.
---
If you join raids TRAINING then expect to get trained in your role. Be it dps/support/heal or kite. And the place for first training dps is golems not the actual encounter. 
---
Also if you join training and have unrealistic demands of jumping into encounter instantly then if it were me i would kick you first because you need to have patience with other new players too. Maybe not you but others  might need training on golems or something else before jumping in raids and learning mechanics.
---
I don't mean to sound complicated but this is all I see:

---
Built up? All I've heard from aNet is literally just something along the lines of "it's not alliances, it's something".
---
Some guy around Reddit saying it's leaderboards is not hype, it's just wishful thinking.
---
Wow, I love your style! Incredible work! 👏🏽👏🏽
---
*cries in reaper*
---
Yeaaa rumor has it living story 5 before expac 3
---
Definitely try out the core game first as it's free to play; if you enjoy playing it then go for the expacs!
---
I made an Engineer about a year ago and did all story up to starting Path of Fire. Soon, once all of my characters are caught up in story, I'm making a Revenant and do it all over again!
---
Erm I thought it was a WvW patch
---
My assumption is you are mostly a solo player? For such I can absolutly understand why it can feel like older maps are empty. But if you have an active, populated guild there is not much in the game that cannot be beaten by groups of five to ten ppl. If we ever reach the point where not enough players are around to populate every single meta event in game casually at all time than maybe guilds will be relevant once more. 
---
It was just yesterday I stumpled upon a cursed shore farm train organized by a guild and they had about 50 ppl following them. This is one of the oldest if not the oldest "meta event farm train" ingame and it seems to be still active. maybe not all the time but definitly every time they are organizing. The only thing needed is a small group of friends to sustain your own events and you will find peeps everywhere that will follow you. Even if you are not going for the newest and shiniest of all.
---
I'll give you 10 gold of you get the 9xp and reply to me with a screenshot 😁
---
Among many sites, gw2timer also has possible node locations
---
Well, it’s not like Arenanet talked about this announcement and how great it will be every day, it’s once again the community hyping itself up and gets disappointed by their own expectations 
---
Bounties are one of the least popular bits of Diablo 3. Most people can't stand them, and anyone serious about rift pushing unfortunately has a gameplay pattern of push grifts during the day, bot bounties overnight for keys. I definitely don't want to see them or anything like them in GW2. I visit old maps all the time, because I feel like exploring or doing some events. I don't want to visit them to arbitrarily kill 50 Jotun. 
---
Open nvidia control panel. -&gt; 3Dsettings -&gt; enable DSR -&gt; pick corresponding ratio -&gt; change game res to 1440. 
---
This way you can super sample up to that resolution and check the performance impact on your pc. 
---
Me and a friend had win against 3 Mirages, own Scourge, and a Spellbreaker. With a Mender Weaver, Boonbeast, Spellbreaker, Core Necro and a Core Guard. It was Fun too see the best Builds fail
---
...and almost all of that ruined by a horrendous villain who had absolutely no business in a Guild Wars game.  
---
You can craft the gemstones.. or buy them... They aren't *that* expensive..
---
Sure they're not cheap but the ore literally has to be obtained via dragon stand.
---
Joko was not bad as a villain, he should've done more. Players are completely lost when they enter vabbi cuz peoples attitude towards him shift 180 without much explanation.. which is bad story telling
---
I agree. I often find myself aimlessly wandering around and would love a navigation system that does a bit more handholding and incentivising progress.
---
You're beating the dead horse. People preferring challenge want to slowly work for things until the final product and there's those who want nothing to do with slow progression and quick jolt of fun.
---
There's no balance in that my friend
---
What about a challenge run? Start at level 1, no boosts, no waypoint use, take the long way round. White gear only challenge? Dead is dead challenge? 
---
You don't need specific ranged dps for shards clear. DHs can just swap to scepter
---
I skipped ahead to LW3 after I finished HoT. I do plan on doing LW2 eventually, once I finish unlocking season three.
---
Rifle Deadeye isn't a great choice if you are basing the decision on buttons. Pistol/pistol is better and also refunds initiative for more DPS on Xera. Deadeye is also nowhere near as good as Daredevil for shard clear since the DE will likely be hampered by the mark being on Xera. Totally agree about the positioning though. 
---
If you have two skilled players I recommend a +1 class (thief, rev , power mes) and a side noder/ duelist (boonbeast, prot holo, spellbreaker, mirage)
---
If you have two players who can't make full use of the above combo then picking a team fight carry combo (scourge + firebrand, blood scourge + prot holo, prot holo + mirage) or just playing two strong 1vx classes (prot holo, boonbeast, spellbreaker). 
---
It all depends on your rank, player skill, your team Comp and the enemy team Comp so there's no one duo combo that is absolute best. 
---
P.s. All the people saying mirage mirage, that duo is only really good in gold and below, maybe low plat. For EU atleast, not a single mirage was used in the finals game of ToL. Mirage is broken but it only really shines as a duelist, however it is susceptible to a +1, can't sustain long 1vx, loses to prot holo in a 1v1 and portal is nerfed out of pvp now.
---
Loot satisfaction is a good term. I've noticed recently that I actually prefer getting vendor junk over certain mats because at least I can sell all of the junk in one click, whereas with certain mats I'm unsure if I should just vendor them, or throw them away outright. Things like milling stones, there are 300000 of them on the TP for the minimum price. The way the TP works makes 99% of all items in this game entirely unexciting.
---
which makes it garbage in gold and below
---
I have concentration!
---
About that cash grab thing... I can see why they think that because of BDO but gw2 is the least p2w game I've seen. If you want to pay for anything it's for fashion and convenience. Even then you can ofcourse purchase these same things through farming gold in game (and it's really not that hard). 
---
The most p2w thing that exists in the game is having to buy the expansions for the elite specs they offer as they are generally stronger than the core specs, however the core specs are more than enough for early to some late game content and I'd recommend buying the expansions anyways for the content they provide and because they go on sale very often to really cheap prices.
---
See this waypoint out there? Come closer, you'll get more exp than enough. I love how this game rewards you for exploration.
---
I really don't know why you're telling me this.
---
During fractal 75 yesterday, 3 people got dc'd when arkk fight started. Wonder if it had to do anything with this problem.
---
Actually as I was posting this some enemy attacked me and then got stomped into mulch by my minions and I leveled up
---
No expansion or update will give me the hype and enjoyment HoT brought me. I played HoT maps endlessly and enjoyed all of it. Learning to traverse those maps was an adventure. 
---
PoF just feels empty! Honestly the best thing I’ve took from PoF is just the mounts, the story didn’t light me up with joy, and the meta events weren’t fun. Some of the season 4 Living World maps I’ve enjoyed simply for the nostalgia of going back to those Gw1 regions but nothing more. 
---
The game took a massive leap forward when HoT came out but it feels like it took a few steps backwards when PoF came out. 
---
You should load binary zip, not source one. 
---
I just realised that I should name my necro Gru.
---
By the time you get to Xera after the button island for the pre-event you will likely be full on initiative. The second one, nobody knows since it's random who gets ported. Though DD does have Soul Stone Venom which would probably be much more useful for a squad having trouble with Xera and potentially lifesaving to boot. 
---
I tried Daredevil on Xera once, and while it worked decently, it didn't really work all that amazingly compared to the two Deadeyes in the squad. That was after the nerf, I think, as well. This *was* my first time playing DD as DPS on Xera though, so take it with a grain of salt.  (I usually play Druid, but I do play DPS sometimes and my prior times as DPS on Xera were either on power Soulbeast or Renegade.) 
---
Before someone gets mad about the comparison again, both WoW and GW2 had the same amount of developers a few years ago:
---
[WoW ran with 140 developers until 2014, ramped it up to 220 after.](http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a594062/team-expansion-behind-slow-world-of-warcraft-updates-says-blizzard/) 
---
[GW2 AMA 2016: 120 devs working on the live game, 70 on PoF, 30 on core team = 220](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/48zlyd/im_mike_obrien_here_with_gw2_dev_team_ama/)
---
it's better to ask the top tier people directly.
---
ask for their discord and etc.
---
this reddit board is mostly pve and not many hardcore pvpers around
---
I'm a "little" behind on crafting 
---
I agree with nearly everything you said.
---
For me I think the big problem with the new living world maps is that you see nearly everything in the map while doing the story. THere isn't a lot of point in  exploring after you have done the story because you have seen it all. 
---
The game feels at the moment a bit stagnant to me. Aside from the living world the rrest of the game recieves little new content, and there is only so long you can keep doing the same stuff.
---
I have been doing pvp, and playing other games. Right now I am only playing pvp once a week or so and nothing else until a new expansion or new elite specs. The living world doesn't really keep me engaged enough to keep the game installed long term.
---
I have a lot of alts with completely different builds and playstyle. I read something, fantasize being that build and go play that build. 
---
Could be made so that picking banner is done by clicking and removing the "press F to kill your dps" all-together.
---
his immortality was the real deal right until they gave aurene some asspull power.
---
Joko overthrew ancient elona and while defeated in battle no one was able to kill him. The order of whispers had to seal him away.
---
When he returned he quite quickly retook control of elona and completely made it in his image. Then balthazar came along and even a former god wasn't able to kill him. Again best they could do was seal him.
---
Dont forget that lore-wise necomancers stopped raising corpses because zhaitans magic took over the minions. Thats why they now summon them from the underworld. Yet Joko had no problem controlling his undead. He was by all means one of the strongest beings in the world. 
---
SEA player who plays on EU servers here (Gunnar's Hold, GMT +8). WvW tends to be most active past midnight, sadly. Although you can play at night and it'll still have zergs/blobs, it's just not peak hour.
---
I haven't seen a lot of SEA players in EU servers as well, but the other day someone was advertising a SEA guild (can't remember the name). I think the ping is better as well? For me it's around 230-250 ping, on NA I've heard it's a bit higher, although I can't confirm.
---
Give the free to play a try at first and if you really like it I'd pick up PoF before HoT. Not that HoT isn't good, but the Path of Fire mounts are definitely worth more than the glider. Get both though, in time.
---
Yet every thread that gets posted has predominantly people saying it'll be a dissapointment more than any hype in it. 
---
These threads go up because they resemble a sentiment plenty of players feel. Also nothing else to talk about unless you care about the \[fluff\] LOOK MY GF DREW MY CHARACTERS XOXO posts. 
---
Pretty sure none that's been around for a while and isn't completely delusional is hyped for the announcement. If it's good, nice, but wouldn't get my hopes up with their track record. 
---
&gt; no region lock anymore 
---
Yeah talk about naive. 
---
Lol alright thanks for the tip!
---
Id rather have no change at all then. Clicking is far more annoying. Maybe an option for it in settings sure but i would hate not being able to pick up banners without clicking.
---
You can already click whatever you want to prioritize for pressing F.
---
What will release more frustration?

Da-na-na-NAAAAAAA!

A few nights ago I dropped an fgs on some wvw lord (which happens very rarely). 
---
We had a banner warrior in the group (which is even less likely to happen than using fgs for npc's). 
---
Guess what happened..
---
k *nerfs guardian again*
---
A good few people in the pvp community (ie. the only people who Anet still communicate with because of one dev who enjoys twitch chat) seem convinced it's this week.
---
I'd like to add that I too started playing with a group of friends, then I met a Guild, and now I'm only playing with my SO after a time (barely) playing alone. And I've never had much fun. Other MMO's got me in the "having friends/groups" side. They always seemed to leave. But I can play GW with the confidence that either I can find a group to play, or even craft it with a bunch of people I don't know. It's kinda cool. 
---
rip storm brand tho
---
pls not.. i wanted to play that in 3.6 :(
---
Alright, so I'm looking though GW2E and can't find anywhere where it shows you recipe unlocks. Could you guide me a bit further?
---
Get mats -&gt; sell mats on tp -&gt; buy gems with gold -&gt; get gemstore stuff.

The Best way to introduce LS1 back again would be in a single Event every year with a queing mechanic. This way, there would be enough people to play the big events, probably.
---
The black lion trading company can probably help with that :x
---
If you want to gather it, others answered already : starter zones.
---
&gt;Maybe an option for it
---
Literally what I said on original post.
---
99% people don't need to pick them up at all. If you are support in fractals or raids then have the option.
---
But in open world? Pfft.
---
&gt;Dies under banner/conjure
---
&gt;Guess I just die 🤷
---
Stupid IPhone 🙈
---
Yeah, normally Anet announces when there's going to be a patch and some general things they're looking to change. We've heard nothing. 
---
Dailies in mmos always made me quit so much faster since it felt like it's the mobile game kind of appeal that gets boring super fast on top of that 🤔
---
Realistically gw2 is giving out way too much with throwing hundreds of things at you every day(that you mostly salvage lol) and since game is pretty much skin wars finding "rewarding" things that they could realiatically give out is... Bad in this design to say at least
---
Isn't it so that last year there wasn't even a new colour of SAB weapons? Or is my memory wrong?
---
&gt; They hardly every do direct nerfs with no buffs, unless it's thief.
---
You clearly missed some of those patches where the Weaver class went from 'stack 6 to continue' to 'barely getting used at all'
---
Thief really isn't any different when it comes to getting buffs and nerfs compared to other classes. The one meme you could name in the period from HoT to PoF is that thief never got any changes that did anything to their DPS to the point of it being that stale that the PoF additions completely powercreeped them until they did the deadeye rework(the 2nd one, atleast)
---
I fully agree. I also wonder where the JP master Josh went? Perhaps he's working on SAB.

But if you have a friend with GW2 installed, you can copy their .dat file to save on download time/bandwidth.
---
I remember going against 2 hammer warriors. The CC was unbearable
---
Maybe, maybe not. We'll know 2 months before its release, and that will be too late :)
---
Basically, the meta devolved into power stacking dps only for most content, and fire field was best or close to the best for most finishers, especially blast for might.
---
So it stopped being about thoughtfully using some abilities in concert with the correct fields to get the best effect, and ended up just being everyone places fire fields only and uses all finishers.
---
HoT tried to add classes that wanted different fields and combos for various things, while fixing the problems with Condi gameplay, but it also added a lot of other ground effects and a lot more large group content, and it ended up being almost impossible to tell whose field was active. So while we fixed the balance problems to some extent, usability problems overtook and dominated the system, and now people just don't run combos unless they can provide both the field and the finisher.
---
I'm also having a ton of random disconnects lately too, and it's taking 4+ full minutes to load into Lion's Arch or Mistlock and another 2 minutes for people to load in. It used to be much faster and more stable, but nothing's changed about my internet. 
---
Tome nerf in Pve: ???
---
Don't listen to silvers and low golds telling you mirage / mirage. It will get you nowhere.
---
Firebrand + Scourge, Firebrand + Rev (herald), Boonbeast + anything that can +1 you (thief,rev), good old condi mirage or chrono bunker + S/D thief combo. But basically as others said, a good sidenoder and a roamer will do the job.
---
Power mirage is not recommended, not really viable at higher levels any more.
---
Should have left the mistake xD
---
Oh oh bumping up this thread so many more people see it, maybe you are about to discover something new! Share more info of the materials you used and maybe other people can try it out as well!
---
The main benefit I see is while in WvW in blob fights which is a major thing for me.
---
I've been playing about two and a half months and I have full ascended on multiple characters. 100% map completion, all story quests done and all masteries unlocked.
---
The only thing to aim towards are Legendaries... which is literally just grind until I get lucky and get the gold to make Astralaria/Twilight as I have the collections etc.
---
If I could work towards amazing weapon skins, outfits, mount skins, etc I would in a heart beat. I spent 1000s of hours in WoW redoing the same content over and over for a rare mount drop or transmog set happily.

Not 50%，you think your wallet still in your hand?😨
---
You're gonna make me use off-world talent?
---
Ooh I want this to mean something, but I'm afraid I'll just be disappointed.
---
I remember getting so into saving all of the citizens that I would just shut up entirely in voice with my old guild. Could not speak. I've always been a fan of content that can *really* make you feel the consequences of chaos and destruction going on around you, make you feel like you're in it, and this did it beautifully. 
---
Indeed, I can never understand how people manage to just destroy the content a week after release, so many other things to do and play, how the hell is this stuff "not enough" although I admit most people I see saying that decide to only play a portion of the patch then demand its too little so maybe I'm crossing wires there. 
---
This was not really how it went down. Arena Net promised that they will update the explorer paths of each dungeon over time, like happened with AC, because they were not happy with the release state. Then they reworked AC, probably figured out that this will be a shit ton of work because of the spaghetti code, and focused instead on a new system they could build from ground up.
---
The playerbase asked constantly for new dungeons and I remember an outrage when HoT was announced with no new story/explorer dungeons.
---
Even if there is a new expansion, each expansion is its own content and features anyway so it's not like they're irrelevant...
---
Oh, didn't notice it. I usually read reddit daily but this slipped past me
---
Even a "glitch" want fishing in this game.
---
Very much this, the game seems almost entirely built around that idea as well, excluding raids to an extent I suppose. 
---
dual wield banners, make it happen ArenaNet
---
I would have thought so too, but we must be over a month away from release (also would they drop raid hints on twitter?).
---
im thinking we’re gonna get help from grenth with slapping kralk in the mists
---
After quite a long break (I left after the 5th episode of Living World 3), I decided to buy PoF and all episodes from Living World 4. In about a month, I was done with all the maps, story and mount collections and now I feel like there's nothing else there for me. I don't really enjoy new meta events and although I thought HoT Metas sucked, I think i preferred them to what we currently have.
---
Technically they aren't raid hints I just think they are. Whats the time scale for release got to do with anything I'm guessing they know the story of the next raid.
---
He got eaten and consumed, by an baby Elder Dragon! his magics and his essence got absorbed into her so in any case even if he was immortal (which i stil belive in then also his abbility of immortality will have been absorbed)

and if JOKO was ABBADON's Lich then why did he fight against ABBADON?
---
Is it confirmed that there will be a balance patch?
---
Underworld new raid wing.
---
Johnson is two cubes down, this is Aaron over in the copy room.
---
People should not hype it up to much since it is really going to make them trip them self over and feel cheated. By looking at the past it will more likely be something that PvE players want (my god please do NOT let it be mounts) and WvW players will roll their eyes and add it to everything else we never asked for that is not supporting our game mode. This is my expectations and i feel both curious and nervouse. If i am proved to be wrong which ofc can happen then i will be the first to write a greatful message about it. But don't hype it to much or it will just make you angry if you are not happy with what it is.
---
It feels like ANet is either putting resources in the things that will give them the most short term return, or that they do not have resources at all. Everything just feels half-assed, IMO, and they have spread themselves too thin. 
---
I mean, there is so much to do in this game, but everything just feels thin. PvP, PvE, raids, open world, WvW, crafting, LW, Story, skins, JPs, Yearly Events, Dynamic Events,  and a thousand other things in between on every map and so on.. it just feels thin. It would have been better if they added less diverse content, but focused more on fleshing out everything better. 
---
Of course, the best case scenario would have been that they had the resources to deepen EVERYTHING... but that's just a dream. Honestly, at this point, I would rather pay a subscription than get everything half assed. 
---
BTW I left too in march last year, and I still don't see a strong reason to come back. I left because I felt that other games have a better PvP/PvE balance and better dungeon (fractal) progression. 
---
I LOVE PvP, and it is the most important game mode for me, but I also need PvE to take a break from it, and GW2 just stands out more of a PvE game and the majority of the community is fine with that too, so I can't see a true focus on PvP in GW2 anytime soon. 
---
My best guess is that we're missing some sort of insignia, maybe there was a special recipe you could buy from the heart vendors or event merchants, but it was removed. Or it supposed to be some sort of ineffable insignia which may be or may be not present in the game. Anyway, the level of discovery recipe is set to 350, so there's that.
---
Game can download stuff while you're playing but that solution depends on your connection and well, patience. 
---
The bare minimum files for game to launch last time I was getting it running under Linux distro on Aug 25, 2018 was approx. 7.5GB.
---
If you didnt know, GW2 has a screenshot folder.
---
Soulbeast + mirage/chrono. If your team has too many duelists/teamfighters, Mirage can swap to rev/thief.

I played through it many times, mostly for the black lion key but also some characters i decided to play through all stories on and sometimes something happen in the story ahead and i go back to story chapters that bring this up to remind my self of what happend.
---
Well and ofc for the achivements but i did not years ago.

**Final World of Desert Guild Scrolls Wars** _**Online**_

Don't forget to get the **_Maximum DELUXE Special remastered HD version reloaded platinum**_ edition!
---
Maybe Dhuum outfit in the gem store????
---
I think they should spice things up and increase the duration of self bleed from Dagger 3.
---
Alright, first of all, fuck you for your incredible talent that has grown exponentially due to practice and time. Second, this is beautiful and you should be proud of yourself.
---
I've completed LS 2 on 14 characters, the least of any story (except for Season 1 obviously).  Other characters are at various stages of progress. Whenever a guildie needs help or wants company I go. It's faster with two.
---
Yeah, node camping is usually a mistake. A team that is against a scourge/firebrand may not be able to win the mid fight, but if they rotate correctly on the map they can still win. It also depends on the map though. Camping in mid at coliseum and keeping an eye on the sides, then the enemies gonna have a hard time getting to your close. Combine it with someone decapping (or capping if able) the far, and it's a win. Also, people make the mistake of fighting only on point. Fighting off point to prevent the enemies team advance, is many times good, even though all in low ranks people keep screaming *FIGHT ON POINT!1!* at you.
---
You badmouthing the druid hedge boy?
---
That's adorable
---
And you need people to do that in the first place, and OP is asking for what works for that. If it's done badly, of course it's a problem, but you still need people to clear them in the first place. 
---
You're off one year. And nah, we have a different taste in shitty music but we're still the same pieces of shit that can't even keep their own home clean and still want to buy another. Or agree on something for the sake of betterment. It takes a celebs death for that to happen but not millions of dying from hunger. Yeah, we may dress differently or treat SOME people like the human beings they are but we've barely changed the human factor. Some can change their outlook but as a whole that takes much, much longer than 250 years.
---
Not going to lie, I find it a little funny that people are apparently downvoting you and upvoting the guy who came in an hour after you, copy-pasted your post and then added a little arrow next to it. This is just the most Reddit being Reddit shit I've seen in a while. It does suck though, especially because you were being helpful.
---
Anet's like "yeah we are working on fixing the bugs that are blocking player's progress" and then release a chair in the gem store. No fix, no nothing... :D
---
What they could do is instead of introducing new maps, vamp up some of the old ones like they did in LW season 1&amp;2. The Awakened invasions reminded so much of the Molten Alliance attacks back in season 1. Toxic Alliance stuff is still around, but that’s pretty much dead and buried at this point, no one does them anymore these days.
---
high dps makes hings go smoothly and personally when im commanding a squad for a boss with very low mechanics actually involved and the dps is high enough to do some of the known popular strats like no updraft or gor or center strat on sloth and xera then if i see them again in the lfg i'll assume theyre competent enough with their class and will give them a slot legit and a shot over other people regardless of their kp
---
I liked season 1. The events were all over the world, they were fun, they gave great loot (and therefore ppl actually played them), and they felt significant. The marionette is an example of excellent content, fun, good loot, popular 24/7. It quickly went downhill with the thing in Divinity’s reach: it required a reasonable group to cut through the zerg, but the loot was restricted so ppl didn’t bother playing after getting the achievements. And its been downhill since, IMO. I haven’t even finished the PoF storyline yet, just CBA. Would love to see some more engaging, good loot (i.e. popular), fun contents in these seasons, not just gimmicky mounts and skins - that doesn’t motivate me at all.
---
no, people just pull stuff out their ass lol
---
I literally had this conversation with my GF last night. I've been playing GW2 on/off for a couple of years now and this is one of the most obvious improvements they could make (aside from uncluttering and cleaning up the menus). There is just so much beautiful world out there but very little of it is rewarding anything for traversing it. This is one way that a lot of that could be solved for sure.
---
Nobody said there will be a balance patch tomorrow, don't wind people up or give false hope lol
---
&gt;And, were there any achievements that were added to the maps just for the aurora?
---
Just the Aurora collections. Which were largely "get RNG drop" and "complete meta / major collection achievement" and "map the place".
---
The 7 day Stellar/Astral collection would by far be the most annoying to complete, luckily the achievement(s) (if there are any?) for unlocking the skins shouldn't be required, since Aurora didn't require unlocking all six Siren's Landing backpacks.
---
yep.. dx12 works on win10 only
---
&gt;**Reaper is kept from having lowcd shroud or no cd shroud because of the reason that survivability through shroud increases with scale of fight**. Just because they stuck to the mechanic of gaining lf through deaths they had to add cd which needs to be balanced multiple times whenever new wvw zerg meta forms so that it doesnt become irrelevant or op.
---
Death shroud and reaper shroud have had a CD throughout the entirity of the game. As far as i'm aware that CD was never even changed. You pretend it outscales due to "lifeforce on death" yet necro has been valid in GvG and in meta's where deaths are rare regardless.
---
The strenght of necro is NOT that it gets free lifeforce. But rather that it's pressure through damage and corrupts when paired with supports is higher than almost anything else in the game. 
---
&gt; Again the problem lies with the core mechanics and weapons on core necro which are common to elite specs too. 
---
Yes, and it has nothing to do with shroud CD and even lifeforce on death isn't very relevant. Issues are "core necro identity" such as slapping boon corrupt and additional condies on everything; particularly AoE boon corrupt. This will always be much, much more effective in large scale WvW than anywhere else in the game. After all NPCs in PvE barely even have boons, ever. 
---
&gt;I can see how a non necro player would not understand if im complaining about scg or reaper because they see only builds and there weakness and strengths. 
---
I'm complaining about you being clueless. I understand you're frustrated with your reaper; but your analysis is plain WRONG. Also i've played both reaper and scourge in all three gamemodes; wouldn't even be suprised if i have more hours on necro than you do. 
---
&gt;  You know reaper was meta in wvw before pof right? 
---
You mean in a MELEE META that hasn't existed since more than a year ago? Gee. Yeah i'm sure anet is holding reaper back because they existed a year ago. You know what, I'm sure anet can't buff berzerker because they'd become overbearing for WvW too. After all they were meta in WvW once. 
---
There's a lot of things they should adress in regards to necro to make it balanced between WvW, pvp and pve. But in all fairness WvW currently has 0 impact on reaper; and getting lifeforce on deaths doesn't have that much impact either. Imagine if you understood your own class well enough you'd grasp that it's concepts such as a "mix of power and condi damage" and excessive AoE boon corrupt mechanics are what causes the disparity between both modes. Also it's - HIGH SURVIVABILITY - when paired with an ACTUAL support. Shroud might not save your ass on your own, but give a necro boons and suddenly he's pretty damn tanky and sustainable. 
---
The reason we can't have balancing discussions is because we have tons of absolute idiots crying about their class without grasping the metagame. 
---
tl dr : Reaper isn't held back by large scale WvW because reaper isn't relevant in large scale WvW. Even if you half the shroud CD to 5 seconds, it's not relevant in WvW because SCOURGE - a necro specialisation - is too fucking good for reaper to be relevant. And yet you somehow believe the reason REAPER doesn't get buffs is large scale WvW???
---
You want rest of the armour parts in gem store? Got you covered, fam! - Anet
---
thanks 
---
druidstone isn't even half as grindy as dragonsblood or astral collections, you just needed to showup for hearts couple times and then kill all the bossess once
---
&gt;No theyll literally nerf it into the ground.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;But itll still be meta xD
---
... you need to choose one. If it's still meta, then it's not nerfed into the ground.
---
The playerbase will cry about nerfs either way, but that just shows they're not interested and / or capable of discussing balance. 
---
this triggers are usually based on achievements unless you need to "consume" item to trigger (like with heart specific items from aurora) so i doubt you need the banner
---
This is exactly what i think. Imo content is rewarded properly, dungeon frequenter for completing dungeon paths, daily fractals, and short dailies which can be made really quickly but each time they slightly push a player to explore a bit. No developer wants to force players to devour content. They want to keep them with tiny daily quests, where they can experience the game without being fed up with it and burning out. Excessive rewarding has the opposite result - people don't want to play a game where they get too many rewards, because they don't feel like it was rewarding at all. Look at masterwork items, players get a lot of them, but they don't feel like a reward at all. Personally i like things this way, when i set my goal i slowly go towards it with tiny steps. Killing 50 or 100 mobs as a daily sounds awfully simple and lazy, it's typical grinding which is getting boring after a while. But you "have to finish it because daily". That would burn out a lot of players pretty quickly. 
---
a delayed bad balance patch
---
oof
---
That video was officially announcing it.
---
Necro: axe 2 +2% damage....nerf to all the scourge skills,they dont corrupt any boons anymore.
---
Mesmer: shatter skills now give bleed,poison,blind,confusion,torment,hepatitis a,b and c,HIV and 10 second of parkinsons.
---
Next expansion is not in sight, and the core game is free to play. So there's no reason to wait on that.
---
There will be some limitations as F2P (mostly chat and trade), but you have access to all core content. If you enjoy it, then buy the Living World Season 2 and 3 passes in the gemstore, and Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire from the online store. Season 4 will be ending soon so a new season pass should be added into the gemstore in about 2 months.
---
After Season 4 ends will be Season 5, rather than another expansion, and that's bound to take at least a year before that ends (which likely will then lead into the next expansion). So if you wait for the next expansion, you'll wait for a while.
---
And unlike MMOs like WoW, GW2 doesn't include access to previous expansions with newer ones. You'll have to buy them all separately anyways.
---
There might be a possibility that this item is scrapped but recipe stayed.
---
People saw through the manifesto though. I remember very distinctly how they said they wanted to change up questing, gone were the days of walking into a town and grabbing a quest that said "go kill 30 centaurs" and they're just standing around in a field.
---
Yeah they changed it, how did they change it? They got rid of the quest giver NPC and just put it on your screen and told you to go kill centaurs, which of course are all in one area. 
---
ok let's recap where the "salt" is coming from:
---
1)it was posted here as teaching run/something others can learn from..but it was filled with terrible gameplay that varied from skill choices and failing many mechanics to saying some arguably incorrect info
---
2)when asked about point 1 you said you were too busy talking on discord which means you didn't care much about the people you were supposedly teaching
---
3) you said you had to lower the kp requirements..which leads us to believe you didn't label the run as a training(or a training with kp requirements which is equally stupid)
---
4)after being called out on some of the previous points you tried to put those experienced in a bad light "they still make mistakes"..yea it's true, they just don't make every single one repeatedly
---
5)just because you sacrifice your free time to help others doesn't mean you can half-ass it this hard..it's like donating food to charity but instead of actual food you just donate 10 buckets of discarded potato skins(it's free right? they should be grateful!)
---
yea, this pretty much sums it up, plus your attitude towards criticism was not good: instead of understanding what others are saying you either tried to justify it with various excuses or make it about yourself in some way("i'm happy", "i was busy", "idc what others said")
---
this isn't anything new btw, someone from one of the raid training guilds made a subpar chrono guide a while ago and they also got criticized heavily on it..oh and their mistakes were far fewer than the mess in your "guide"
---
&gt; But if we kill Kralk in the underworld his magic wouldn't (possibly) reach Tyria.
---
The player character killing Abbadon in GW1 caused Primordus to stir, even though he was killed in a different realm (Realm of Torment). 
---
&gt; After a band of heroes defeated the fallen god Abaddon in 1075 AE, the residual magic from his death led to a temporary imbalance in the flow of magic, which caused Primordus to stir.
---
[^^^src](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Primordus#Early_years)
---
Which could still mean that killing Kralkatorrik in the mists would still have consequences for Tyria, though it might end less catastrophically than killing him on Tyria itself
---
&gt;get a feel for many of the most common Mordrem enemies.
---
But nothing can prepare you for getting gang-banged by Smokescales... 
---
plot twist,there isnt any balance patch today.
---
 chrono can make same shit  2x in row,till thats gets nerfed or removed,its gona stay in meta.
---
Perhaps not an asshole... a nostril? 
---
Challenge runs are not [uncommon in WoW](http://wowchallenges.com/index.php?Show=IronManRules), City of Heroes had the MAN challenge and Petless Mastermind in CoV, and people gush elatedly about how you can play GW2 how you want so I was suggesting ways to shake things up. Skyrim has mods that add the need to eat, drink and rest, survive the elements etc. Fallout NV and 4 both have opt-in survival modes. It's not at all unusual. Anyway, this is a roleplaying game to some extent, so why not play the role of an explorer? 
---
Pacifist, Iron Man, Nomadic (have to walk everywhere), only dropped loot can be equipped, only white gear, naked... someone got to level cap in WoW without ever picking Horde or Alliance, which is quite remarkable. Challenges like that are something I've thought about from time to time that GW2 lacks - there's just no-one really doing it. The nearest, I suppose, are raid guilds who try to raid with groups of 7 to see if it's possible.
---
Playing with an extra level of challenge can shift how you view the game. I love playing RPGs without fast travel because there is a level of exploration that happens naturally that you miss otherwise. I got from Darnassus to halfway up Stranglethorn in WoW on foot (I was aiming for Silvermoon City), the long way round without dying or killing a single mob (levelled up via crafting, discovery and pacifist quests) until a panther ate me and I really enjoyed the challenge of it. I played a Blood Elf tourist with the silly selfie camera thing, trying to line up cheesy tourist shots (again, without dying) for while and that was fun. 
---
People say "anything you want" whenever anyone asks what they're supposed to do as a newbie, which I think is quite unhelpful, but there's oddly almost no organised challenge runs or anything like there are/were in WoW or CoX. I would totally be up for a white-gear dead-is-dead guild or something if we ran events together. 
---
&lt;/rant&gt; 
---
I hope banners become like turrets if they ever get a redesign.
---
This is more painful to read at each sentence.
---
Why would you ever delete a Gift of Exploration? That's just absurd...
---
Next hint will be balthazar then menzies
---
Why do you look for grind? You clearly dislike it, to the point most of the content gw2 has is unplayable for you.
---
Ofc. try pvp. But for different reasons, there is no value in grind.
---
Congrats. That first world completion really feels like an accomplishment. I remember mine more fondly then some of the other epic activities in the game.
---
As someone who's currently exploring other games this would bring me back immediately
---
Haha, it's just funny looking back now on the build. Probably pretty decent for surviving in Open World, but, just not ever what I would run now. Plus, I know my gear was a hodgepodge of stats, I didn't have all trinkets, etc.
---
And O_o. Why would you ever delete those gifts? D:
---
I was shamed into finishing my first legendary last year by my guild. It's amazing how after doing it once it doesn't seem so intimidating to do again. Twilight went way faster.
---
Now I've gotta do map completion again though. And decide if it's gonna be Bolt or Meteorlogicus next...
---
I'd be surprised actually. Wing 6 ended on a cliffhanger so I expect the next raid to continue the Djinn story instead of going back to the UW. This is backed up by the theme of W6 and the legendary ring collections - Qadim wants the MF to create living creatures and that's also kinda what the collections hint as well.
---
Nerfs guard in pvp.  
---
Plus 5% buff to Necro Axe skills
---
Dhuum can't interfere with reviving anything at the moment, in either way. Not in the state we left him in the Hall of Chains.
---
I pictured his rampaging is currently only noticeable in the Mists "around Tyria" but his power and greed and influence over the Mists would grow exponentially, and that we would have to kill him before that happens. 
---
&gt; They should have made Hallowed Ground 10 man instead, or changed Master of Consecrations so traiting it allows all Consecrations to be 10 man (then maybe put it in Master tier). 
---
Purge &amp; WoR more or less have no target cap anyways. If they gave purge an actual target cap on pass-through it'd be a massive nerf. They could have also made elite shout or retreat have 10 man target cap. 
---
Staff is pretty fucking awful in PvE. It's only purpose is providing very limited might to 5 man groups; and having a ranged heal. And if you need staff for the might or the range healing, then FB probably isn't a good fit for your group either way. That's why it's so gimmicky. 
---
The issue with staff is even if the burst heal is larger; if you don't have a tome to swap into after you burst heal you're literally useless; and you lose significant amounts of healing compared to mace over time. You can also get burst healing through several other sources (F2, bow of truth, MI, double symbol into shield skills, dodge, ...).
---
With the CD nerf on tome, this issue is EVEN WORSE. You go into staff and you use symbol, holy stike and empower. Then what? Spamming 1 while waiting for holy strike to come off CD? That's just terrible. Staff is made a LOT better by using its high impact skills and then swapping to a tome for support. But in PvE this is even less of a thing because of how situational most tomes really are. 
---
I'm not saying there's no places for staff in pve; there is. It's just that these limitations make it an incredibly situational weapon that imo is still overused. Most of the time you shouldn't be equiping staff in raids / fractals. 
---
Mandatory for WvW and to a slightly lesser extent PvP of course; because all the changes to staff benefited these gamemodes more than PvE. Which makes balancing the class in the future more difficult. 
---
I would love it if they ended up giving out an entire set after all. 
---
He just ate a fruit and pooped a seed
---
At least banners get replanted when you just drop them automatically.
---
As well as various articles accompanying it
---
Yeah, that's the problem. Unless they bring back lost talent (or it's already there but working on something else) we're really fucked.
---
I still prefer moving to GW3, even if it fails, rather than GW2's slow agonizing death.
---
If it’s cash, then people will participate.
---
If you want to do it, then I can get you in touch with some people who could help you. Just pm me here or on discord (Angeels#0001) 
---
I will say though that you shouldn’t expect massive viewership (1-1.5k max) and that if it’s for business reasons you’re looking to do this, I would say it would be unwise.
---
Could be related to W5 ... since we have a new raid coming with the next ep confirmed. 
---
Post-fight victory tune from Final Fantasy playing in the background.
---
15 is stil pretty high for a pug though
---
They didn't really say that. All they said is "that there is more to the Gods that has yet to be revealed". I mean, it could mean that they show up - but it doesn't have to. 
---
was it their uncle at nintendo?
---
Looter shooter is *not* the same as battle royale. It’s also known as MMO-lite, basically an online game with RPG mechanics but lobby based hubs. Destiny is the primary modern example. 
---
The roads near the offices might have been clear, but that doesn't mean the roads near the dev's homes were.
---
I like what you did there, but you will get downvoted lol
---
Oh the salt ... calm down and stop qq'ing pls.
---
Beds are her spirit animal. I can relate. 
---
Mirage meme is overblown. Its a great duelist and good roamer and is capable to own unaware players spectacularly, but thats it. It doesn't win games on its own. People just went spiralling on it recently. 
---
Haha, because all of my guildies had one and they kept asking me where mine was is all : P
---
15k is your average bs warrior, which is why i didnt put that in the post because new players will take that and think doing 15 on a simple boss is actually good its actually better to tell them something higher of what actual good dps is, so they can actually improve
---
Even if it's a mobile game? :^)
---
Lol, the complete ignorance of people that honestly think that GW2 doesn't utilize the GPU at all.
---
I think the gods are well aware of what's going on in Tyria.
---
I generally run through it with each of my characters as part of progressing their personal storyline, some never made it out of the jungle. :P
---
Hee Hee 
---
Also the one that grants Swiftness. Skill 3 I think.
---
Same here, but was just stating a couple reasons why they would be
---
The problem with story instances is that loot is garbage, thus you have zero reasons to repeat them, the only exception being the few missions which give you a Black Lion key.
---
YMMV but I haven't been refused any time I've asked if I can play heal scourge in a pug group that was asking for a druid/healer.
---
People have definitely been improving from the whole "META ONLY" mentality.
---
Of course, I don't ask pugs if I can play it on bosses that it's terrible on.
---
Generally, towards the end of the week you can find LFGs where people don't care what you play. Things like "drunk w4" and stuff. You could totally join one of those as a heal scourge if you'd like.
---
There's... a mastery.... perk... ? :O
---
Yeah but the collections are expensive as hell
---
&gt;  but to be honest, I don't know where else to turn to... 
---
Guess it's time for you to get a life then
---
&gt; Your the one that called what I said facts that I never disputed as being my opinion before.
---
I said you expressed it like facts, because you did. You still didn't get that or is that just another troll?
---
Scroll up, learn to read, I mentioned countless times that you only talk about your own opinion. 
---
And no, forcing people to agree with your opinion by insulting and humiliating that person (this is what you did) is **not** the point of a discussion.
---
Troll somewhere else, read the rules...
---
You forgot Ebola.

I'm not throwing WoW under the bus. I respect what they are doing. /s Milking cow is an hard work /s. 
---
My point was just having a sub will not equal more release of content. Even though, WoW is still one of the few, if not the only, mmo giving a still meaningfull experience of Endgame PvE.
---
Sometimes, typically last raid before an expansion could leave Wow without any patch for a complete year.
---
That's me on Monday mornings .. trapped in my bed. 
---
Oh wow, just got back into it when I bought the expansions but I need to hit 80 first it seems. 
---
Try the free to play version first. Decide wether you like the game enough at level 60-80 to buy an expansion. Don't wait for Expac 3. It is unlikely that will see it this year.
---
Yeah honestly so sick of these idiotic threads popping up like twice a week now. "OMG my friends and I all played this game for 4k hours and we're bored now!! DED GAEM" meanwhile there's posts every day from people just now starting to play.
---
Obviously ANet is not performing as well as hardcore, long-time players would like. But there is literally nothing any of us can do about it, and having a whiny circle-jerk about it every week is especially unhelpful.
---
I've played a total of 170 hours with my main character and still dont have even the tier 4 perk so it's gonna take some time :D
---
This is why most of its traits are for power and why most of scourge's traits are for condi, clearly it's a condi spec despite being very intentioanlly designed for power and you have a retarded moron not to see it. 
---
While very true I main power shiro and mirage hard counters me so I'm biased
---
I think while we're getting info on Grenth and Dhuum posts we shouldn't throw away the focus on succession.   Grenth succeeded Dhuum, Grenth was also the son of Dwayna.  I could totally see this going in a direction of either we have a long lost demi-god situation or we're looking into how to create a god.  &gt;!Perhaps even deifying Aurene so that she may become greater in death than alive. (Which is some pretty blatant allegory...)!&lt; 
---
So you're not looking for "best" you're looking for "safest"? I don't know about safest but I have a pretty good idea of something safe.
---
Chrono's: Good for the reasons you already listed. Solid boon output + regular pulls.
---
BS of course: They can be power for the CC if you want but I don't think Xera's break bar is too difficult to break. People usually only have issues if it comes up when she's standing in a bad position.
---
Druid: Solid 1st healer choice for boons, spirits and CC.
---
2nd Healer: I think both heal scourge and heal tempest are equal in terms of carrying potential as a 2nd healer. The scourge can bring some extra CC while the tempest has much more sustain. Tempest can also bring CC if you switch up some utilities. Both can condi cleanse 10 people. Tempest has better ressing potential if people are stacked and Scourge has better ressing potential if people are all over the place. I'd say it comes down to which one the player prefers using.
---
Then the rest of the team comp is of course down to what you want for your DPS and I think you've overlooked the potential in Power Daredevil. The stolen skill cleanses ALL condi's on the ENTIRE raid, it has incredible burst CC with Basilisk Venom, and has no trouble cleaving adds or clearing shards with Staff or Pistol/Pistol.
---
Most picks are fine though: Dragonhunter, Chrono, Holo (careful with knocking adds away right after they get pulled), Daredevil and Weaver can all get the job done easily! You don't necessarily need ranged damage to clear shards. Honestly, the only reason I'd consider bringing DPS with a ranged option is because you don't want to end up stuck with a bunch of melee DPS on buttons when you get ported at 20%.
---
My personal favourite picks would be:
---
2 Chronos, 1 Condi BS, 1 Druid, 1 Heal Tempest, 5 Daredevils (Yes Daredevil is my favourite power DPS option in the current balance patch. Those raid stolen skills can seriously hard carry groups.)
---
Then change it up from there to suit your group (e.g if you don't have anyone that can play Daredevil well then Dragonhunter or any other dps I listed are all capable replacements).
---
No, you're a dogshit moron. A narcissist of the highest order. A cult leader. Who never ever admits his wrongdoings, or ever admits that he is wrong even when he truly is wrong,  the most infuriating kind of person. The person who joins and ruins every community he's  apart of. An obese, bloated sack of shit who can't find any better use of his time than flaming casuals on the internet. A condescending pseudointellectual knowitall who doesn't know jack shit about psychology and takes MBTI tests seriously when it's just astrology for people who *think* they are intelligent. 
---
A person that deserves a forced lobotomy. A person who constantly thinks they are smart and always right and that everyone else is wrong. You are evil incarnate. The average sexist, racist, neoliberal gamer. 
---
Taking a drill and putting into your ear until your brain becomes a slurry would be so extremely cathartic. 
---
Do you think it might have something to do with the account bound upgrade components you get as one of the early leveling rewards?
---
I'm guessing that you say it's 16 days for Dragonsblood because you assume people will only get the guaranteed 3 from the tomb, but it's possible to do in fewer days depending on your luck.
---
Considering they apparently are looking for a new world to populate with humans, it would be wise if they kept Tyria in their sights. Would also have been wise to somehow still make their presence known. Religiousness is not yet on decline with Tyria's humans, but at some point, it might be. And then the Gods could be seen as abductors and invaders when they return to take mankind away. 
---
Really, if they are not watching at all, they are a little overconfident/stupid. 
---
nah they will nerf the thief sword autoattack a 15% 
---
Suddenly reminded of goats in trees.
---
&gt; With HoT we asked for a map or two with less map-wide meta and more exploration.
---
HoT had two main problems that made players say that:

•Meta-events were blocking exploration progress.  ("Shouldn't need a group to finish personal goals." Same for hero challenges.)  
---
•The *timer* on Dragon Stand was a huge problem. If a fresh map didn't get going in about 15 minutes of the forced refresh, it was useless for the next 90+ minutes.  
---
There was also the issue that map-wide metas made it hard to find a place to sit and idle (clean bags, take in scenery, etc) which also came up in comments. But I didn't see much call to completely ditch the concept.  
---
PoF could have *improved* on map-wide metas rather than make them mostly unnoticeable. 
---
I LOVE finding hidden gems in GW2! I am doing map completion *again* and already I am finding things I missed the first time around. Thanks for sharing! 
---
sure, which is why i said replaying the story for the sake of story and lore it self rather than farming or achievement hunting :)
---
Damn... dhuum really beefed up since then
---
true, but some people still re-watch their series, or a good movie they havent seen after a year,or two...or 4  no?
---
when its sunday but your mom stll wakes you up.
---
Going to have to say no.... Not enough keys for the shit I need to bind now without adding more
---
lol, if they need so much time and resources invested for a mobile game then they are really in big problems in terms of allocating resources, planning, development plan, communication between teams, leadership, motivation, and hard work. 
---
Catdow Behemoth
---
The problems people had with her was mostly caused by her background imo. I liked the idea of a crazy Sylvari villain personally.
---
Well aware there is a post like this on the front page, but this is far too relatable PepeHands
---
Well, Diablo has paragon levels and greater rifts, and GW2 doesn't have anything that could be an equivalent for increasing difficulty and competition, but there's also the Season achievements. At least something like that could be done for GW2.
---
Commander has "no idea" how to continue and having Kralkatorrik as an antagonist for the next season would be really boring. He is a big dragon who breaths crystalls, next.
---
Gw2 uses ports 80,443,6112. The first two are HTTP/S, the third one is used by some game downloaders. Notably Warcraft 2/3 and GW1, so there's some chance they're blocked.
---
Or just deal with the root of the issue: alacrity and quickness.
---
All I'm saying is that just having the gods killing him off in a cinematic wouldn't be the best way of dealing with him story-wise.
---
I believe they save the voices unaltered, then they apply a filter when the game plays the sounds them. 
---
I've been told that voices are easier to compress unaltered, and since I've heard a few charr and norn NPCs that din't have the alteration and sounded more like humans with less deep voices and without the charr growls and clicks, but later got their voices fixed, I'm inclined to believe them.
---
&gt;Also if they think necro staff is a fun weapon then i would assume they also like watching paint dry.
---
No interest in paint drying but necro staff is my favorite weapon in game and is the reason I have a legendary staff.
---
Just because someone does not like the culture they are surrounded with, doesn't mean they're not members of that species. Rytlock had a past of being bullied and shat on by everone, and no one there to support him. I wouldn't enjoy my culture either. 
---
I see that some people want him to be this badass embodiment of every Charr stereotype ever, but: 
---
1) He didn't manage to hold ties with his warband
---
2) He became friends with a human when the two races were still largely at war 
---
3) He frequently seems to have quarrel with the citadel
---
4) He spends a lot of time with us and not as a part of Charr society, he is also teaching Tyrians Revenant magic on the side, or has done so at some point. 
---
There really are better mascots for Charr society than Rytlock Brimstone, and this is nothing new. 
---
Dunno man, PvP balance looks terrible to me. There are some builds that basically dominate the playing field and determine which other builds are actually playable. And since you mentioned mirage: you dont need a mirage to be good. On equal skill levels though, what exactly would you call a 1v1 mirage counter? I have yet to see a mirage player on stream going "ah shit its xy with a something build"
---
It would certainly revive certain maps for a month or so.  
---
Good for me though as ive completed or are 75% through all of them!
---
Definitely agree about the crafting issue. The system itself is one of the game's weakest aspects and definitely needs a revamp, along with itemization as a whole. 
---
I don't mind that crafting gives access to best-in-slot gear/materials, but the ins and outs of material flow haven't been dealt with in a reasonable manner, so then crafting feels like just another hill to climb before something "good" happens.
---
I am actually happy my gear is not immediately rendered trash every 4 months. If you need an item lvl to chase, thats your preference. All I need to keep playing is content updates.
---
Ah, true. Edited the 23 out. Think it was more the story going “oh by the way she can do this too” than the age that irked me.
---
I hope it has robot arms and transforms into an evil version that shoots blue fireballs.
---
This sounds like the WvW and PvP reward system, but instead it's for PvE. 
---
I played LW2 episodes as they were coming out and never replayed them (maybe I will once I decide to go for their achievements finally).
---
I would like to have more friendly rewarding system that is based on playing whatever you like and have fun with.
---
Current daily reward system is like a daily chore were I am limited to kill x mob not other or view that vista in that map.
---
I spend most my time doing 1v1 duels which is sadly is not counted in any rewarding system.
---
And I still feel that I have to go out of the fun zone and try to win a random rated match to get my daily  2g reward.
---
It's a bit off topic but what I really want is achievement system for all existing events. Like every zone has a ton of them sometimes even around 100 different events and you get almost nothing for completing them.
---
Just give us some simple checkout system, 1 AP per event and some zone specific/unique reward if you do all of them.
---
It can be even repeatable
---
Yeah thats pretty much the point. You can only raid in exotics because there is just one more gear tier over it that doesnt increase your power by 30%. 
---
How about: “The game needs to be more fun” Pog
---
Well let's be real, the chances of Fresh Air, the 1 single most easily abused free damage source, is likely never gonna get buffed. 
---
The game probably doesn't allow same keybind for several actions ... ?
---
doubtfull, resurrections are one of those things that's best used sparingly 
---
it's not actually grenth, just some poor middle management sucker
---
*havingsexbeast

Bandit crests is a map currency which allows you to buy bandit chest keys which is necessary for silverwastes farming. Crowbars allow you to open pact cargo which will give you some loot with Cargo parts which is the currency for Verdant Brink. Map currencies will be necessary for certain items and legendary crafting. 
---
The map currency is now more predominant in the game and is used alot in living world maps aswell.
---
And yes the level 53 bag opening is the way to go for getting gold. The method is farm silverwastes with your character in a populated map (look for LFG for "sw farm" "RIBA" etc to join an organized map) farm the chests and do events. Don't be stuck in one place and move from one fort to another to tag yourself on events. Afterwards you will have alot bags which you need to open with your level 49-55 ish character and salvage the gears that dropped. Selling these materials will give you the most gold. Also while doing the run you can grab some Core Tyria masteries and i highly recommend you focus on Auto loot mastery can't remember what it was called but this will make farming so much easier.
---
They will never nerf mesmer cause if they did no one would play it. I've been playing Gw2 for 6 years now and Condition mesmer has always been king. 
---
&gt; Gods knew Kralk would enter the Mists, thats why they left - they are as Balthazar said "cowards".
---
We don't actually know why they left, but the mists are basically everything in existence, so wherever the gods went now will eventually be threatened by Kralkatorrik as well.  
---
And they did not know he would enter the mists as he didn't have that power until Balthazar was killed and he absorbed Balthazar's powers. They didn't know Balthazar would even fight Kralkatorrik, since they (except for Kormir) had left their realms before they knew about Balthazar having escaped from his prison:  
---
&gt;**Kormir:** When he returned to this world, Balthazar disguised himself as Lazarus with Lyssa's Mirror—the only magic powerful enough to hide the truth from our eyes.  
---
&gt;**Kormir:** By the time the ruse was revealed, the other gods had already departed. And soon, I will join them.
---
[^^^src](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Facing_the_Truth#In_the_Sanctum)
---
&gt; And they actually set a trap so Balthazar could be released so easily to speed up the process, I'd not be even surprised if this " Balthazar " was just an illusion.
---
This makes no sense, as per the context above.
---
&gt; But well believe in your Joko theory no matter how stupid it is.
---
??
---
Again ?
---
https download from akamai for patches 
---
So we go to where ever aurene is now and with the help of the gods look for her and get her back.
---
Can we please be clear there is no proof that the next patch will be a balance patch. Nothing on the main GW2 page, the GW2 forum page so unless the community knows something these posts make no sense.
---
Man that takes me back
---
&gt; you are sent to the Mists and meet Grenth
---
no, you meet The Judge who is a servant of Grenth
---
&gt; I know Aurene can't really be dead
---
oh? enlighten us, please
---
Makes sense actually, never thought about the mists in that way (the god's realms being close to Tyria within the mists) and that would also be a good argument against the gods coming back, since they may not even notice the threat yet from whereever they are right now.
---
I approve. Happens mostly in PvP, for me. The difference between a res and a stomp can mean the difference between a victory and a loss. Every second matters and fumbling around can get me killed or completely turn the tide of the match.
---
I mean Grenth is gone... do idk?
---
That's why I included "universal" option which just stays as it is. If you set up "Stomp" for Z, "Resurrect" for X, "Use" for C and "Universal interact" for F, and find yourself in a situation where you can stomp, ressurect and use something (portal, siege), you can skip the current queue by using your own keybinds or just keep pressing F to do them in whatever order they go now.
---
couldnt you just take a screenshot?
---
I had never actually looked at it before but good god you're right,  their version really is ass
---
People are desperate
---
Exactly this. Very often there's not even enough time to select allies via party UI and game decides that you totally wanted to use a necro portal instead of ressing.
---
How are most of the traits for power? Go here and read them (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reaper).  There are 12 traits. Lets look...
---
"Critical hits against chilled foes causes an explosion that chills adjacent foes."  - condi
---
"Whenever you inflict fear, you also chill. " - condi
---
"Striking a chilled foe grants might and life force." - condi
---
"Chill lasts longer, and chilled foes take more damage from your attacks. " - condi
---
"Chill deals damage over time. " - condi
---
5 out of 12 traits are all about chill.  Almost half, seems pretty balanced between being a power spec and a condi spec.  
---
Well of course not, but with how Mirage looks, everything is honestly possible
---
You will basically never struggle in general PvE if you are running a raid build. You might need to adjust it a bit if you plan on soloing champions etc, but in general this is best done with trait swaps which are pretty easy to do.
---
Fortunately Reaper's raid build is very well suited to open world already as it can easily stack might and quickness on itself and vulnerability on targets!
---
I wanted to say something along these lines, but probably not exactly in the language you chose.
---
I mean, am I like the only one that has gone through POF twice and enjoyed it both times? I still plan to do it on more of my alts. Opening the Crystal Desert maps is challenging and fun. I just feel like that takes more time to do it at my pace. I don’t feel like there’s a content drought.
---
I also don’t feel like there’s a lack of rewards. I think the vocal people on Reddit are just impatient and easily bored. Of course, I grew up when super Mario brothers on Nintendo was basically the “only game” there was. You just learned patience and perseverance.
---
I’m not an Anet white night, but I actually enjoy this game. Sure, there are plenty of things that could be improved, specifically dungeons, but the game is still fun, and I’ve been playing since the beginning (Fractals, Raids, open world, PvP, WvW). If I could pick one thing for Anet to do, it would be to scale dungeons based on the party size, mainly so I could solo them. That alone would revitalize them and future proof them. Not perfectly, but a huge improvement.
---
I think the main problem is that Anet doesn’t view WVW as endgame content. Because they don’t, and don’t allocate it proper resources, most PVE players don’t view it as endgame either.
---
Some builds (and specifically some of their trait choices) benefit heavily from being in a group setting. Many of the stat combinations also consider things like spotter and banners being there for the stats. Some traits make you do more damage depending on the number of conditions on the foe, or boons on yourself. Outside of raids or fractals, you don't get much out of these, so it's important to always know your traits and when to use them.  
---
Is it viable to just copy them and not think about it? Sure. But it's not optimal once you leave the raid setting.
---
I thought about that particular case (yes, coz of the meme), but it depends on how all those interactions are executed - if, upon clicking "F to pick up" your character uses "Pick up a bundle" skill a case of "Banner vs conjured weapon" is probably impossible to solve without reworking entire bundle system...
---
This is the best mastery to have ever been created.
---
Like, the QoL it brings is just insane, especially if you farm with a ranged character in open world :D
---
He even reached other worlds. 
---
The giant stinkhorn-like mushrooms are not from Tyria, and the chak-like and karka-like branded enemies (riftstalker and riftcrawler) are not karka and chak, they are creatures from another world branded by Kralkatorrik that use the same animation rig. 
---
He even reached an alternate versions of Tyria in which humans and charr never had a truce and their military technology reached similar development to current Earth, since [these](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Unknown_\(NPC\))  appearing from rifts in Jahai made [these guys](https://youtu.be/KR2Esy83MQ0) canon.  
---
In theory, you would expect an alliance system to also have a leaderboard.
---
Generally speaking, raid builds are optimised to get 100% crit chance for power builds and condition/boon duration for condi / boon builds (or as good as possible/necessary).  
---
While you don't need to 100% crit chance in open world, it's still cool to have, so you can change your build up in this regard.
---
You can always just keep your raid build for open world if you feel like it. It's also a good way to get used to it if you want to (I personally do so, running the raid builds everywhere). People may disagree for various reasons, but there's not really anything you can do wrong with builds in the open world.
---
I do it. Is fun but its not rewarding or epic enough. I hope if it was a little bigger and had more attach patterns and such, it would be more entertaining. Certainly wouldve been another thing to do in wvw.
---
I believe dragonhunters are a very bad choice for xera.  My static banned dh at xera so long ago, I can't fully remember this, but there was a bug involving dh traps and the center of xera's platform.  I think maybe it was that the very center of the platform is slightly higher up so the traps wouldn't trigger?  I tried to find the info for it, there was the only thread I could find: (https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/8035/xera-not-triggering-dragonhunter-traps)
---
You seem to be a bit out of the loop, they’re talking about mirage - not chrono
---
You bring up some good points!
---
I'm fond of playing heal scourge for my average guild group. It's useful for the entire wing 1: doing no green at VG, carrying the torch for spirit run, tank Gorseval, barrier his retal phase, kite flak and epi for Sabetha. It's also okay at wing 2 and 4, can multi-task an epidemic along with CC and barrier. For wing 5, heal scourge really shines at Soulless Horror and can green-kite for Dhuum.  
---
The thing about heal scourges is, the bad ones only think of it as a rez bot ("Oh, I got Transfusion, I can carry people by rezzing the downed!!!") and neglecting the vast capability a ~~heal~~ scourge can do, or being badly geared and ill-informed about the Shades mechanics.  
---
A heal scourge serves its niches and doesn't need anything else like druid's spirits or warrior's banners.
---
so do you want me to reply in context of a bug, like why didnt you just grab a normal one, also are you blind or illiterate you did see i said within the first phase at or above 20k is possible and you dip and average around 15k right. if you actually take 5 seconds to look at this you'll see that the dps is at 20 for the first phase. like if youre going to use a sam log why choose one where bug the split phases
---
I merely stated facts without emotion. Did I say I want the game to die?
---
While you're correct about that, this post is meant to ridicule that very idea of getting a "huge" balance patch with a classic meme.:p
---
Forgot to say, anywhere my chronos have to bring a focus pull? I'll let them use swords and bring spectral grasp for them.
---
True!
---
I expect deadeye to get hit. Either stealth on dodge will get exhaustion like other on dodge skills, or binding shadow will get nerfed. Or both. 
---
&gt;Come on, we all know that not a single character died completely in GW2.
---
There has been *one* story resurrection in the entire 14 year franchise. That one has been well explained: it was only possible because the judge Grenth left in place wanted to see Balthazar defeated, because our body was still intact, and because we were able to get the energy necessary to jumpstart the body.
---
That's probably not going to happen again, especially because All or Nothing went out of its way to say that Kralkatorrik has devoured the Domain of the Lost. There's no reason to name-drop that unless they want to remind us that the judge who allowed us back is probably gone.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if Aurene's spirit appeared to us, like how Snaff's and Eir's did recently. But I don't think she'll return to her body.
---
We nerfed chrono in raids cause it was op, but now we're nerfing the firebrigade cause god forbid you get a decent alternative
---
It's a big risk to invest so much in a game and then have it flop. EverQuest Next and Wildstar are probably frightening most game companies at the moment.
---
literally the biggest thing keeping me from playing the game is just how much i feel at the mercy of whats in lfg. 
---
optimal =/= viable
---
Reaper is 100% viable in raids
---
New outfit idea coming in the gemstore for 2k gems only (included a sick glider skin) 
---
Get people with good DPS then you only have to worry about clearing 3 shards in the entire fight (due to pushing the timers and skipping several mechanics). The lower the dps, the worse it gets.  
---
Good dps classes there include: holosmith, DD, DE, power chrono.
---
That's chrono exclusive on CS.
---
If you're fighting a lot of fat open-world bosses, I recommend epidemic even as power reaper; it's just so strong when you dropping 99 blood stacks on the surrounding mobs.
---
People rush through games, better stop making games alltogether. Or is that suddenly too extreme for you? 
---
You could name it Dashcon. 
---
Dhuum forbade any kind of resurrection anyway, which is one of the reasons Grenth went to overthrow Dhuum.
---
To be precise after you get to level 9-10 areas in starting zones.
---
When they introduced the "new player experience" they pushed the appearance of most nodes  until later levels, so they ended up all mashed together near the end of the maps. 
---
Don't worry guys! The Catmander is here to lead us to victory against the Shadow Behemoth!
---
I've broken no rules, you just don't want to discuss the game anymore, so there's no point. Never trolled by definition.
---
It's definitely viable, though optimal open world builds typically have a bit more survivability in skills and traits, mainly stun breaks and condi clears which are extremely useful if you're playing solo. But if you can do without these Raids builds should still work damn well in almost all PvE scenarios.
---
Fair enough!
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/802982/#Comment_802982
---
Fuckin' that. 
---
If you're doing the corner strat tell the warrior to place the banners on top of one of the jade bricks. Problem solved
---
In open word you can not rely on buffs from others. eg Without spotter, banners and pema furry you need way more precision for 100%
---
no extra achievements were added for aurora besides the 2 collections needed for the precursor. Ona of them basically required you to have completed the meta achievements of eeach map and the other was an scavenger hunt (bring an electrum Ingot here and infuse it x 20 times or so) or something along the lines. So probably the best preparation you can do is to have the meta achievements of each map completed and have a good surplus of each map currency. I don't think anet would force us to complete all those weapon/armor collections though. 
---
Think that there's the new legendary greatsword release too and who knows, i don't discard the possibility that anet does a dual version like they did with the first one (that could me merged to get a 3rd one).
---
And then there's the raid ring. There's no word on the next raid release but in my wet dreams i see it being released together with the last LS, so people working on legendaries would be busy for some time.
---
I really shouldn't upvote but all the people who never waypointed after dying at Teq really annoyed me, especially when they spam chat with rez pls.
---
I was more comparing those two to the maps before Jahai. I think Thunderhead is at least trying to do the same thing, and is better to return to than Kourna and back, bur Jahai is definitely the peak of the season so far.
---
Thinking about painting red to stand out from the background and smooth it out some.
---
 Is soon rewards are one time per character, rewards for competing a mission that use the achievement system are once per account. 
---
Good afternoon - can someone give me a simplified description of the condition renegade rotation? Everything on snowcrows/metabattle has 50+ steps, and there's no way I'm going to be able to keep up with that during a raid encounter. All the videos just seem to show someone hitting their buttons with no description whatsoever, either. 
---
thanks, i hate it
---
No.
---
A year later...
---
Visually, looks really cool.
---
Gameplay wise, I'm not sure. Hopefully it's more glider than not on the "Good WvW changes" scale.
---
Unless your build is based around being downed, then technically you are only barely surviving. 
---
Down state Necro SUPREME
---
ahahahahahahaaha
---
But there are no friends left to play with :(
---
Would like to see this in open world too. Looking at you, Octovines.
---
I think if they keep it in the swiftness (since that is basically permanent already when in groups) realm (so like no more than 40%) it shouldn't be too bad.
---
If you are talking about a dps build it will work fine. You wouldn't need to fine tune it if you don't want to for normal PVE. But if you are talking about specific role builds such as tank, healer, hand kitter or similar then those builds are probably not going to help you that much.
---
Oh boy.
---
I'm going to wait until we get further concrete information about what this all entails before I can form a proper response.
---
"We're planning on releasing a new mount that player's weren't expecting"
---
There it is, folks. He was right, I  think no one was expecting a WvW only mount! 
---
fukkin' thanks!
---
Interesting, will reserve my opinions for now
---
It looks like this is the only mount that works in WvW, so I imagine it's built with the maps in mind... Maybe something with speed equivalent to a griffon on land, based on the footage? He looks pretty chunky and armored. 
---
I doubt it's going to make things feel that much different, tbh. 
---
AHAHAHAHAAHAAHAHAHAHHAHA
---
waited so long
---
for this
---
fuck me thats not what i expected at all
---
fuck wvw and fuck the development team that was on enough crack to think of this
---
...Does this mean I have to get into WvW now?
---
Sounds like daily achievements with extra steps
---
But yeah, monthly achievements as well that some people mention.
---
The pictures look like a cooler version of journal /achievement menu i guess, but the content and goals should be re-thinked
---
I am not sure mounts in WVW are a good idea. 
---
In was hoping for it from the start.
---
Cool!
---
But is it just me or does it look kinda similar to the griffon? At first I thought it's just a griffon skin. It also has similar (if not same) movement animations and the raptor jump as it seems.
---
Interested to see how this turns out.
---
A lot of WvW players hated on gliding when that was first introduced, but honestly, it was a great change.
---
Mounts being added has always been a concern, but a WvW specific mount makes sense to do, and if balanced correctly (we will see about that one lmao) it could be really good like gliding.
---
And it's mounts.
---
Fuck.
---
Whaaaaaat
---
Here good Sir, your ticket for the hype train
---
"Fixed an issue where some people were still able to get over 3 fps in WvW"
---
Is this real? 😍
---
Still no word about alliance system
---
Is it just me or did they just make a charr-mount? 
---
That’s a thing?!?
---
Hopefully it's exclusive to WvW and deployed like a Siege, it has no point in PvE as it would only "look cool".
---
According to the post, this is the only mount that will work in WvW. So long as they keep it balanced for the game mode as others have mentioned here - needing supply, not running too fast, etc - similar to how they introduced gliding, then I see no problem.
---
Seems nice
---
One of the major things I've always disliked about WvW is how long it takes to get around the map just walking. This is a great change and might finally get me into the game mode.
---
As long as it's built for WvW and not like the others, I'm down.
---
It looks cool but I'm worried they are trying to make this a bigger thing than it is.
---
It was actually on my list, but I imagined it as a dolyak that can carry allies who can't use mounts so they are not left behind.
---
is this an out of season april fools joke?
---
Absolutely brilliant 
---
Let's ride in style while everyone else sets fire to the game mode and leaves. :p
---
It's pointless since in the extra time it takes you to kill any enemy, the enemy will just have more time to kill you.
---
Just kill it first.
---
My 8ball says 8, i think that means try again later
---
I don't know whether to laugh or to cry...
---
OHHHH MYYY GOD GIVE ME!
---
&gt; Why?
---
You know the answer.
---
I guess I'm curious to see how that's going to work, but, sure, okay.
---
It's Mount vs Door (mvd) now.
---
It's like they really know us WvW crowd! /s
---
Srsly wtf are they thinking? Lets make WvW more like EotM and just about flipping shit and less about balance and fun fights! They really don't know what the WvW audience wants. This is purely made for PvE players to get into WvW, get that mount ASAP, and then get out again. 
---
[Live reaction from the Anet office upon reading this comment](https://i.imgur.com/esS3z.png)
---
Tanky gear makes it only worse. Just try to get a better feeling for the combat, enemies and your abilities. Use some more defensive skills and maybe invoke an earth elemental that can tank harder enemies for you.
---
They said it announcement wasn't related to the alliance system
---
From the link: “A new mount available exclusively through WvW. It’s the only mount that can carry you into battle in the Mist War, where it’s skills truly shine.” 
---
I’d say that means you can use it in PvE, but you mainly want it for WvW
---
Part of me really hoped Grothmar Wardowns would give us a Devourer mount. Meh. 
---
Goals 
---
Finally running for 5 minutes when you die will not be a thing anymore.
---
This was a hard pain point for wvw not in my opinion but when I ask my friend to come
---
Oh hell yeah!
---
learn to dodge animations, extra toughness and vitality wont help the over all issues of you dying to basic things
---
&gt;"Something big is coming to WvW"
---
What's a "WvW"?
---
why not F* you instead?
---
Hahahahahaha
---
Anet actually dont care about wvw player. At least may they can earn more money from wvw with skin ... Really disapointed even if i expected nothing. 
---
Seems to hard to take EOTM arena , make monthly 15vs15 like pvp system . Or just balance game for wvw ... 
---
first update in dont know how long for wvw ...and we get mount ..totally what is needed right 
---
It looks great. I just hope it's not locked behind an absurdly high WvW level.
---
Fuck these idiots.
---
So disappointing. Not only out of touch with the community, the community has been fairly vocal about how this is a determent to the game mode.
---
Shame on ANet.
---
Why would you want that? It won't hurt PvE and if you don't want to use it, don't!
---
WHY? JUST WHY?
---
I was lazy, but chrono would be my example as well^^
---
* It’s the only mount that can carry you into battle in the Mist War, where its skills truly shine.*
---
Is this mean that you can only use it in wvw, or you can earn it in wvw and use it in PVE too?
---
I asked for it &gt;.&gt;
---
I'd imagine it to be quite gated, as to not have entire zergs run around on siege golems 2.0.
---
I mean it's dope but definitely NOT what WvW needs right now...
---
Expect nothing... Still be disapointed
---
They probably used the Griffon animation "skeleton" instead of making one from scratch. 
---
Youre talking about a company that cant even get their servers to handle 100 people fighting in the same spot without skills grinding to a halt.
---
Are you by chance talking about HoT maps?
---
How to get people in WvW?
---
Create a WvW only mount, and attract tons of PvE players.
---
Queue +100 on all maps, so the loyal WvW players cant join anymore.
---
Good job Arsenet, I'am out
---
Fair enough. At least I wasn't expecting it when I read the article. 
---
How has that got anything to do with it? They still asked for it and so my point stands valid.
---
Hmm, I’ll give the earth elemental a try, but I’ve tried most of the defensive skills but the most useful is the Arcane shield, but that doesn’t last nearly as long as I’d like. Everything else doesn’t help that much.
---
we didnt like gliding because of all the exploits and bad use cases it caused for *months* before stuff was patched  
---
  
---
it will be the same with this mount, im expecting a lot of exploits via the dismount animation already
---
What sort of content are you running? The hardcore people in fractals/raids will expect zerker's gear and good dodging to maximize dps.
---
In open-world and WvW, however, you can get away with a lot more. You could try running Celestial Armor/Trinkets and Zerker's Weapons for instance. You get the survivability boost and a minor boost to your healing/conditions at the cost of a chunk of pure DPS. Here's a build I was theorycrafting for weaver in that vein:
---

---
The idea is that you spend most of your time weaving between Air and Fire and keeping either Uravel or Primordial stance up all the time. Start a fight in Fire/Air, then attune to 2x Fire and use Uravel. When Unravel runs out, attune to Air/Fire and use Primoridlal Stance, then Air/Air with Unravel, then Fire/Air with Primordial, and repeat. Dip into Water when you need the healing or Air/Earth for disrupts.
---
With the heals you get from attunement-swapping and stance-swapping and the various barriers you give yourself your survivability will go way up.
---
I'll definitely look into getting ARCdps - thanks for the helpful advice!!
---
It’s important for engineer for sure. 90% of their healing comes from blasting water fields
---
Reminds me of the dog-demons from original Ghostbusters.
---
Filthy thief.
---
The game will be dead before the alliance system comes out
---
5 inch diameter. 
---
Great. Seems to be the most shit ever announced for wvw.
---
I think I'll get it try out, then quit wvw. Really depends.
---
Mount has to:
---
- be not faster than someone with swiftness on him (else roaming is completely dead)
---
- mountability has to be way weaker than siegeweapons
---
Or
---
- mountability has to cost mats
---
Sorry but this announcement is nothing that wvw players wanted, just shows that anet doesn't care a shit about wvw.
---
I guess there will be fancy skins, so they can get even more cash from wvw players.
---
Mounts have their own team. The people working on the alliance system or existing WvW mechanics don't build mounts.
---
I play a bit of WvW, but I'm also in that second group. Walking around is such a chore.
---
Imagine the amount of cheese with the out of combat mechanic and mounts ? I can only assume thief and condition mesmer will abuse the mount system and OOC .
---
Grammatically correct
---
I know and I’m trying, but there are some attacks that feel like you can dodge. Even if I dodge through the enemy, they’ll still whip around and hit me.
---
Especially when there was still traces of the unreleased multi people rhino mount in the files
---
HoT and PoF
---
Good players

---
+40% out-of-combat speed is my by-eyeball (and probably unreliable) estimate of what they were showing in that video, yes. About the same as the shrine buffs from desert BL.
---
It's just probably the most annoying class ever to fight against.
---
The mount can leap like the raptor.
---
* Laughs in PVE *
---
Charr car tactivator?
---
The irony is that the official forums censor vulgarities into the word "kitten."  If you want to know where Warclaw kittens come from, head to the WVW section.
---
Because the game is in life support, they just trying to grab as much cash as they can.
---
What the fuck is a krakoto
---
As always ANET never fails to deliver..... disappointment
---
I hope that is not a strat like the assault roller. If it is, people planning to come back to try it will be pissed.
---
The video is weird, the dude is alone with his mount in WvW breaking NE inner of Stonemist. I hope that it wasn't balanced around solo capping stuff :). If it was and it's just a regular mount unlocked through wvw points or masteries, well, goodbye rams.
---
So no more roaming?
---
Geez.. Worst decision ever. Anet just lost a shitload of players.  It will change wvw for sure but not to the better.
---
I completely agree. I think a WvW mount has a lot of potential if done right. 
---
Hopefully the "Mount = Uninstall" crowd can hold their fire until we see how it actually plays out.
---
i was reminded immediately of mortal kombats dragon upon seeing, but it is an awesome design
---
It kind of resembles a Manticore without wings. 
---
 https://mythology.net/mythical-creatures/manticore/
---
which is sad. they made a big deal about the announcement, if they weren't gonna commit, why even tell people about the project. 
---
What is dead may never die
---
It is already not well received from WvWers it seems. 
---
*IF* you go for defensive gear, get Marauder's. It's the smallest offensive stat loss for the durability and you can interchange it with Berserker stats as needed based on your incoming damage. Just mind your crit cap drop Superior Elements if you overcap. You can also swap out your food for Fried Oyster Sandwiches for -10% incoming damage in exchange for 30 power and 70 ferocity.
---
Ideally, though, you should focus on actively mitigating damage instead. If you're struggling to survive, it may be worth breaking your rotation to cast Earthen Vortex, Updraft, or Riptide to evade damage instead.
---
Judging by some of the negative reactions on Facebook... I'm absolutely terrified for the alliance update. Throw WvW a pretty unique bone and people say it's dead and how PVErs should stay out of their mode
---
Wvw players complaining about the stagnation of the game mode, and also complaining about every single change. Name a more iconic duo.
---
Dude
---
You can literally jump the fucking pull half the time, that's how bugged it is :/ feelsnecroman
---
Wonder if the 2 GvG guilds left in the game are going to complain that their dying game mode finally got another update.
---
Unpopular opinion but... I love the idea:-)
---
Whenever there was a pveer trying to introduce mounts to wvw there were 5 wvwers shutting him down AND THEY GO AND INTRODUCE MOUNTS... ARE THEY MENTAL..
---
That is the only way 
---
&gt; To get you in the saddle quickly, you’ll earn double WXP when playing in WvW from February 26 to March 5. 
---
makes sense
---
If it helps you can get a reset from a vendor and get rid of one of the less useful ones 
---
Cry havoc and slip the Kittens of war!
---
The mount itself looks great but I cannot imagine a way to balance this correctly. This is not what WvW needed. Mount skins may be a good income source in the short run but really, if you want the players to stay, then get to know your players.
---
mounts announcement for pof: we dont need mounts!
---
after mounts: this is the best thing evah!
---
gliding patch wvw came out: gliding sucks in wvw dont do it
---
after gliding patch: wow this is so amazing!
---
mounts in wvw announcement: so out of touch wit the community
---
after mounts gets implemented:  remindme!(feb 26, 2019)
---
Let me tell you a story about little game called EVE Online. 
---
Long long ago CCP Games designed capital ships (the big scary badass weapons of mass destruction) with a vision of mind. This vision was one of universe where such ships will be rare and used not often. They should've been flagships, should've instilled sense of pride and accomplishment into any alliance that was powerful enough to build and protect them and fear in hearts of their enemies.
---
Now everyone and their mum kills NPC in a Carrier, going to have Supercarrier somewhere next week and if some alliance loses a few Titans (the biggest capship) it doesn't matter because good fight already replaced didn't want those ships anyway.
---
TL;DR: gating doesn't work, somewhere soon (next week? next month?) you will see entire blobs roaming on mounts if that will gain them any sort of advantage. Unless that'd be gated with 2500 WvW rank, then you'll see constant moaning and bitching on forums.
---
I mean, I'm happy with terrifying armor charr-cat though.
---
Curious about acquisition. Reward track, buy with some combo of WvW currencies, tied to level like the higher-end armor? 
---
Goes without saying they're doing this, at least in part, with gem store mount skins in mind, which means they'll want PVE players to have reasonably easy access to it, plus it will have to be usable in PVE too, perhaps with some of it's skills disabled (i.e., WvW only). 
---
If there's a hefty time/currency cost though expect a great many salty PVE players adding their complaints to the chorus ... 
---

|-|-|-|-|-|-|
---
I’m only doing Open world stuff, I’d like to run trials/raids with it, but in no rush. I’ll give it a try when I completely understand the role.
---
I’ll give this set up a try, I looked at the stances but they didn’t seem all that useful defense wise, but I’ll give it another try.
---
Well, the current mounts are fast but fragile, a slow but chunky one would be a nice contrast and I could see myself using it to charge through groups of enemies in PvE.
---
As an ele you are squishy so dodging is a must. However to get tanky gear is not worth the trade off. Traits are your focus for tankiness. The sword trait in row 1 of weaver will give you extra health that can give you more time to heal up. On top of that the trait that gives you barrier on dodge helps a lot. For open world I would grab that stance that gives you barrier on activation to help cover mistakes.
---
I was fire/air/weaver for PoF content but I found fir/water/weaver to be helpful for for HoT when things can be a little tough.
---
I do run sword dagger, your biggest threat is burst damage so you need to remember your cc. Earth 4 is aoe cc and air 5 is a decent knock back. Water 2 is an ok disengage and water 4 and 5 are good for survivability.
---
Way to prove, yet again, that no-one at Anet gives a rat's ass about WvW.
---
The ramming opportunity plus the supply carrying potential there were priceless.
---
Maybe for another time.
---
there probably isnt a single possible change thatd be well received by most wvw players tbf
---
&gt; monetisation
---
Biggest one.  Plus if it's not usable in PVE they will be able to directly track how much money it makes and (hopefully) justify diverting resources to more WVW development.
---
As my guild says, "It's always 'leg day' in world-v-world."
---
I've always said not having at least 25% perma-swiftness was a deal-breaker for me in any WvW build for just this reason. It'll be nice to open up a wider variety of builds without constantly falling behind your group, nice to have some way for people other than avian soulbeasts or NASCAR warriors to outrun solo roamers.
---
There was a reason you had to run for 5 minutes, because otherwise you could never lose a objective of you make it back there in 10 seconds like Cragtop in ABL.
---
You know what ... I would much rather have a dolyak mount I can use to haul more supplies around.
---
It was the same for gliders, still remember all the doom and gloom, turns out it was fine.
---
Yeah... i am not touching it till we get the server changes suggested over a year ago now.
---
The game mode just doesn't work atm. 
---
Knowing the wvw servers this will be laggy as hell
---
&gt;On February 26, befriend the warclaw—a new mount
---
Fuck yeah!
---
&gt;available exclusively through WvW.
---
Hell no.
---
The mount's skills might spend supply.
---
Pretty much.
---
Though, I think it's a mount, but with only one "rope" by door possible at a time. With a high CD on the rope.
---
So? I want necro to do 100k damage with staff 1. Does that make a good idea? 
---
Remember  those thousands of people asking for gvg in a game called "guild wars" since 6 years? Give them a mount﻿!  
---
 
---
All we asked for was a nice little balance patch but instead we get mounts.
---
Now they can sell WvW mount skins. Which means they might be able to fund actual WvW development, right?
---
or probably more how the armor/backpiece is tied to certain wxp levels.  It'll probably require a certain wxp level to unlock the collection/ability to just buy it/whatnot.
---
This will look great with my Catmander tag while wearing my chef outfit! :) In all seriousness I want to see the implementation. In my view its the easiest way to recruit new folks into trying out WvW as a game mode. I'm willing to give pretty much anything a shot right now. 
---
I'm kinda hyped now, wasn't expecting this one! 
---
yeeeees!!!!
---
Okay, but how is this a spoiler? 
---
you have natural evades in your earth sword 2 and water sword 2 as long as youre not talking about champions most thing have obvious tells on what you're actually able to dodge or mitigate through
---
Cool, and more players to run away from it just as fast as the issues still stand. 
---
This would have been awesome AFTER guild alliances and tne new world agnostic system. But before, well... 
---
Looks like it has the same or similar animations as the jackal.
---
How do you engage on a group?
---
These days guilds that still fight against random groups on borders stealth up and engage from stealth for instance to get best possible engage, that would require you to dismount, but oh,... there is noone there anymore as they have perma 40% swiftness.
---
Or you don't stealth, you just dismount and try to attack, oh they are FASTER THAN YOU.
---
It looks like it has some skill to attack gates... Seriously, what about 70 people using that?
---
Abusing that dismount animation,,.........
---
There's soo many bad things this brings that you can't imagine.
---
Did they give any hints on how to unlock it?
---
Gliding can only be used in territories you own but this looks like it can be used everywhere since it is shown breaking down a gate.
---
**Pure speculation on Mastery Levels:**
---
1. Summon mount, very long cooldown after dismount.
---
2. Drastically reduce cooldown on dismount.
---
3. Half fall-damage to mount.
---
4. Head-butt does ramming damage to gates.
---
5. +20% damage for head-butt.
---
There is demand for a new *good* MMO.
---
I'm not against mounts in WvW, but I am worried this might make horrible 30 minute stalemates more common in places other than SMC. If they don't balance it right it'll destroy the amount of time it takes players to respawn and get back to the fight.
---
LMAO.
---
Yup, works outside of WvW but has no skills, according to the comment on the post on Tumblr
---
http://guildwars2.tumblr.com/post/182917106213/behold-a-mobile-cattering-ram-ฅᐠᆽᐟ-calling
---
People just like to hate even if they dont know how it is implemented
---
Or massively improved, unless by roaming you mean ganking.
---
Getting from one objective to another in small groups, ready to fight or back off from groups of different sizes, is going to be much much easier now. So will getting to your own structures to defend, past gankers and tail chasers.
---
Screenshot shows a 50/50 split. Seems reasonable to me.
---
I still haven’t memorized skill names by heart, are those off hand dagger skills? I remember very few of them being all that defensive, but I’ll take another look at them.
---
Still no asura to throw over the wall
---
I don't really see this being anything but the exact opposite of a good idea. Maybe WvW was better off not receiving attention from Anet.
---
he got the official permission from anet but he put it on hold atm:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jn5OM9LMuM&amp;list=PLdxmChRD2epclQvFE-gOZlObvLYB0petM
---
Head to the WvW section of the forums.  Absolute shit show there with more salt than all the oceans. 
---
It’s funny because for a game that prides itself on fashion it has literally the worst selection of armor skin options etc in like any game because bosses etc don’t drop shit like in other games. “Yay I killed the boss gimme my      Random exotic armor I can sell on the tp for 33 silver” 
---
K, let me be the first to say that I think I'm usually pretty optimistic. Or at the very least, I withhold my frustration because I understand ANet can't please everyone, and sometimes that person is me.  
---
Right now, I'm reserving my judgement for the release. We'll see how it goes. But given the presentation, I think everyone's concerns are completely justified.  
---
I don't like it either when people piss and whine every time anything happens to WvW and do the same when nothing happens. I think people need to be more willing to look on the bright side, to accept changes and to adapt to them. In this case however, I'm pretty well on board with the torch and pitch fork mob.  
---
Again, we'll see how it performs when it's fully released. I'm trying my goddamn hardest not be pissed right now but... Let me give you an idea of how this feels to people who are strictly WvWers:  
---
Imagine ANet stops updating PvE and starts giving all their attention to PvP and WvW. They neglect to add anything to PvE for the next several years besides occasional patches that no one asked for like, let's say, all NPC mobs now have a minimum of one CC skill to encourage active dodging. Every now and then they give you XP buff weekends or some week long event like NPC's are now Legendary rank and tell you "updates are on the horizon!" but constantly go months with nothing. And when something does come, it's the kind of stuff people have been saying "imagine how stupid it would be if ANet did _this._"  
---
Then they fucking do that.
---
Props. If I had gold , you'd get it.
---
Looks to be faster than normal player, deals damage, has a leap ability, is meant to siege gates, twice the amount of character models so more lag, not limited to territory unlike gliding.
---
Only okish reason for mounts ive heard is "i dont have to trod back to the tag" which would be fine if you get dismounted as soon as you get in combat but that doesnt seem to be the case.
---
Mounts are also immune to crowd control so theres that, unless this mount isnt.
---
It's not a good add with this amount of information. If anything would have been good to have something how it works to not cause "ill uninstall immediately" people to get out of control.
---
Part of the Books are recorded I believe, but still a work in progress and not finished yet. I haven't seen WP upload one in a while, someone would have to ask him about the project. But hey, WP did do a video somewhere explaining why the books weren't put into Audio and how he got the rights to do it. Anyway, good luck. &lt;3
---
sounds the same for anything tbh
---
I can write a 500 word essay about skill injectors and their role in destabilization of EVE ecology, but that belongs on r/Eve and there are people far smarter than me that already written whole thesises about it. Nothing had changed.(
---
LMAO have you ever been in a three way fight? the skill lag is insane just by LOADING THE ENEMY. Your skills won't go off even before you get in combat. 
---
LET'S ADD 180 MORE MODELS!
---
Isn't this breaking the game too? Yes it is.
---
I don't agree, would this make life easier? Absolutely.
---
Is that good? Absolutely not.
---
This would lower skill cap on macro play, learn to click the character models/banners/whatever you want to interact with. Don't  make this game easier than it already is.
---
It is after all a tab-target combat system.
---
Now sometimes I can agree there is some screen clutter, preventing you from picking up banners/weapons because you can't target the object, while not the perfect solution there is 99% of the time a camera angle that will allow you to interact with it.
---
Non cancer meta?
---
I mean, nothing was preventing you from opening outter and inner wall by yourself on almost any keep (source: was a serial solo/duo keep opener).
---
Did you just throw darts at a number board and assign stars that way, or is this parody?
---
The comments on the YouTube video are salty af. I'm not a huge WvW player but who knows. People hated gliding when it was announced let's see what they do. It's not like it's simply mounts on WvW. It's a mount that's specifically designed for it. 
---
Could you please elaborate on "cool fights?" Is that something based on environment, player mechanics, etc?
---
The rest makes sense. I'll get behind that.
---
But gliding did fundamentally alter the game play. Now you're no longer stuck as a 'defender' on a cliff. Just jump off. Now instead of having to jump down a ledge to defend NET, you can just glide into it.
---
There are negative impacts to gliding.
---
Let's unseal Dhuum again and ask him to revive Aurene, then we seal him again. Wing 5 twice a week confirmed!
---
The skeleton seems to be the same but it does have different animations.
---
But golems are super slow to move around.
---
How do you know that? We see it jump maybe once in the video, but we don't know if that was a flashy engage skill, or something on a long cooldown.
---
Plus, it hardly looked like it went as fast or as far as the raptor leap. 
---
Nah I don't want my eyes to burn
---
wow!
---
Yeah that was exactly my issue with WVW. Im definitely coming back to play this! havent played in months.
---
At least golems can be disabled...
---
&gt; after gliding patch: wow this is so amazing!
---
Disagree. It altered the game play in a negative way.
---
Apparently it IS useable in pve , but has no skills.
---
And honestly? Freeing up my build variety to not have to worry about Swiftness and/or get left behind by my friend(s) when playing with them if I want to go more power is really refreshing. Especially because some classes sacrifice damage output for increased speed/mobility, while other classes have the two bundled into a singular ability anyway and aren't forced to choose.
---
search the forums/reddit posts that have been made about this.
---
Are you at least going to eat shoe if it's not the case? It's not fun saving your comment to just quote you later.
---
It's shit.
---
Yeah, all 2 of them on the WvW team
---
I assumed it'd be for PvE. At the very least, this saves me from trying to reserve yet another keybind.
---
Is this the delayed www news we were all waiting for?
---
I wouldn't mind a dolyak mount that lets you ram doors and carry bonus supply.
---
I just mean mesmer skills work well with the AI, compared to some of the other classes and their popular player skills.
---
Basically you don't need to micro a well thought out mesmer hero
---
Appreciate the suggestion!
---
That's 1000% accurate.
---
People in servers I'm in have been discussing WvW mounts forever. This seems pretty in touch to me, honestly. 
---
Yes, sustaining a healthy meta is absolutely necessary. But do you mean that, as far as content goes, you want things to remain the same?
---
Would be nice to get some use out of those extra points. 
---
I dont think its a bad idea to implement the mount, its better than nothing at least.   
---
From what I've heard one of the biggest things is that there is just no good incentive to actually try and do good in WvW, the zerg meta is boring and sieging feels bad.
---
Because you claimed you'd drown in ore... And I've never had that problem because I crafted the gemstones and then only earned enough ore that I needed ....
---
Again, your entire comment is determined upon the new mount actually being usable by 180 people at the same time. What information have you heard that the rest of us haven't in order to jump to that conclusion? 
---
We know it hits gates, right? So reasonable assumption, it'll have enough health to survive AC fire and other siege haze for a decent amount of time. That amount of HP + mounted movespeed boost means good luck dismounting people and getting fights open field. Gliders already made it easier to run from fights, but this is on another level entirely.
---
Even 1k viewers would likely be worth it - especially if that's a starting point we can grow from. We very well may reach out to you in the near future on discord, thanks!
---
I'll show them , I only get 7 fps in ALL game modes !
---
it's okay though. MOUNT SKINS ON SALE
---
Ok. So let's check the progress on the list of internet meme animals:
---
* ~~Raptors~~
---
* ~~Bunny~~ 
---
* ~~Manta ray~~
---
* ~~Dog~~ 
---
* ~~Owl~~ 
---
* ~~Beetle~~
---
* ~~Cat~~ 
---
* Birbs 
---
* Parrot
---
* Penguin
---
* Sloth
---
* Gorillas
---
* Hippos
---
* Hedgehogs
---
* Frog
---
* Raccons
---
* Elephants
---
* Goats
---
* Lizards
---
* Sneks
---
* Spiders
---
* Human babies
---
We are getting there!
---
Better class balance, the current meta is awful
---
Better siege balance.  Trying to take a T3 keep is nearly impossible.  5 people can defend 50 on T3.
---
Better reward for taking T1-3 keeps.  Currently, you get nothing extra from taking a T1, T2 or T3.
---
More incentive to actually win a matchup.  Winning gives you nothing.
---
Balance better to reward taking keeps or fighting.  Right now, the only way to win is to PPT.
---
Balance servers better.  Right now, for NA for example, if your server has a big OCX, SEA or EU presence they you can easily climb to T1.  If you only have NA prime you will never make it out of T3.
---
You can already see. It's faster than swiftness and it has siege ability... What more reason do you need to uninstall.
---
Only time I ever experienced this was when I was on crappy wifi. Just saying. I've never experienced major internet/skill lag in WvW (framerate is a mixed bag though lol)
---
It's more that there are several builds and you have to be versed enough in a couple of them. Mesmers are among the most flexible professions but I don't think they *really* excel at anything in PvE; it's their flexibility and jack-of-all-trades nature than makes them so valuable. They can do a lot, but will need to respec a lot to do it. 
---
I play support/DPS and basically use the same gear for everything (Diviner's/Berserker's) and just swap in Inspiration for raids and tweak my skills about for boon support. 
---
Some people really get put off by the aesthetic; you have to have zero issues with producing pink and purple sparkles and butterflies whole you cut your enemies in half. Malibu Barbie Does Acid At A Rave  is how I'd describe it and some people *hate* that aesthetic. 
---
So if you for over 6 year ask for A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A,A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A,A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A,A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A,A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A,A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A,A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A,A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A,A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A,A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A,A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A,A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A,A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A,A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A 
---
But instead over the 6 years that gone by you get B, B, B, B, B, B, B,B, B, B, B, B, B, B,B, B, B, B, B, B, B,B, B, B, B, B, B, B,B, B, B, B, B, B, B,B, B, B, B, B, B, B,B, B, B, B, B, B, B,B, B, B, B, B, B, B,B, B, B, B, B, B, B,B, B, B, B, B, B, B,B, B, B, B, B, B, B,B, B, B, B, B, B, B,B, B, B, B, B, B, B,B, B, B, B, B, B, B,B, B, B, B, B, B, B,B, B, B, B, B, B, B,B, B, B, B, B, B, B, and then when WvW players get mad because they never ge what they really ask for then other players AND Arena Net goes all like Meh there is just no way to please them!
---
Like WTF?
---
Golems cost 100/150 supplies, can be disabled, they are somewhat limited by the amount of supplies a given map have and they are incredibly slow,how in the world are you comparing that with a mount that seems to have the speed of a raptor?
---
Like the person said, if this isn't a siege or tactic, it will break wvw BADLY
---
Idk im looking forward to it. Everyone was complaining about gliding being added to wvw, but most people seem to enjoy having it now. Have some faith, it might turn out really well.
---
have you had your daily dose of gambling?
---
How did this happen? I want to do this myself
---
But anything related to siege will probably cost supply, like that rope to pull doors open.
---
pretty wise to get the fuck out tbqh
---
Its not like WoW, you only have like 15 buttons to begin with.
---
Mesmer is rather easy tbh.
---
Man the assumptions in this comment section is unbelievable, you would swear they are shutting the game down.
---
Anet: wvw needs content
---
Players: no mounts please but yes new content
---
Anet: mounts :3head:
---
They said it can be used outside of WvW, but the abilities are mainly towards WvW stuff. That’s all I can really say for sure
---
*Wooo* It's your **3rd Cakeday** LastPieSlice! ^(hug)
---
I've run both of those builds, and Christ do I miss flamethrower engi. There's still an almost-viable scrapper support build that uses flamethrower for tagging, but there's nothing it does that other builds don't do better. Man do I wish flamethrower would get a buff. Core engi needs another buff, period.
---
I’ve been running Signet of Restoration, but atm it only heals me 200 every time I cast a “spell”, which doesn’t do much against the enemies that take out half me health in one hit. 
---
I’ve been wondering, when it says “spell”, is that any skill? Or only utility?
---
Ways to balance it:
---
* Limit the speed.
---
* Make it (or its skills) cost supply.
---
* Limit how many people can use it on a door at a time.
---
People who don't understand there are fundamental differences between the content baffle me
---
If you ask the veterans they always agreed on what they wanted. But if you ask everybody and their grandma with her goldfish about it then yes it is divided but so is Fractals, raids and eveyrthing as well. 
---
Better class balance as it's awful to play right now.   
---
Hey, we could balance the game but let’s just do something no one asked for. - anet 
---
That's good analysis?  O\_O  High school student?
---
Gotta milk the cash cow for more skins. Tap that untouched market of WvW players.
---
I was referring to the fact that about 50% of comments on the video are loving the upcoming patch and 50% is hating it. 
---
Lemme whip out the credit card real quick
---
It probably won't be that bad or as bad as some people are suggesting.  However, the issue is that this isn't what hardcore WvW players wanted in the slightest.  There are much bigger issues and requests with WvW the community has expressed for a long time now.
---
I assume you will not be able to mount while in combat (would be retarded otherwise). so I already see every zerg trying to stealthrush structures with it, trying to avoid fights. thats wvw for ya. I heavily doubt it willbe balanced... 
---
Yes.. her initial implementation may have left something to be desired.  However, in retrospect with the addition of some backstory and cascading events caused by her I still find Scarlet to be the most influential villain GW2 has seen yet.  She destroyed lions arch, reformed the kessix hills map permanently, created three evil alliances and awoke an elder dragon leading to the first expansion.  She may have been a bit to cut and paste as far as evil villans go but I, for one, like the cliche evil doings she brought to the franchise.  After her we fought a mind melding elder dragon for gosh sakes. Sometimes it’s nice to be a bit more grounded and relatable when fighting an antagonist.
---
Same thing happened when they announced gliding in WvW.  Too few details to tell if the uproar is rational or not, but if gliding was anything to go by, it's not going to be world ending as some are making it out to be.
---
Last he said was that the audio books were not really popular and the amount of work they require does not match the low views so the project is on hold. 
---
You are assuming it's "faster" golem. You are assuming it's attacks are unlimited, as on golem. You are assuming it can effectively take siege when under attack. You are assuming it's as hard to destroy/kill as golem.
---
Do you have ANY proof for your claims?
---
And better piercing attacks than rifle. But that's the only thing it does better than rifle, so nobody runs it.
---
Thats what wvwers do. I mean its what the whole fucking community does but wvwers are at least as guilty of it as everyone else. Beg and beg and beg for change, immediately bitch about it for a month, decide it was alright after all.
---
There are actually quite a few people here (and in my server/guild Discords) who are pretty hyped. 
---
I don't understand why this thread exist, like literally we only got a video and a short blog post about it, how can ***anybody*** know ***anything*** else about it to further discuss. its only speculation. Some of the questions are speculation worthy yes (and I love speculation) but stuff like *'do you need siege to build it*' who knows!? 
---
IMO a big part of roaming is having to balance around your own mobility whether your are solo or in a small group. If people can all run fast-ish with that then you don't have to invest anything on mobility.
---
And to this I could give the assumption that on the WvW mount you will have you own health like the Heal-Skill currently does on a normal mount. So you would loose your dodge and other abilities.
---
The problem is neither of us know if this is how it is done from Anet, so just wait and see. If it is implemented in a bad way, then complain
---
Too much to say about it but i want to say that the only thing we know is that it is comming AND NOT what it really does. Maybe it ist dogshit but it could be ok 
---
Blog post says this is the only mount usable. As such, it's probably built with these concerns in mind. 
---
YOUR gates, huh? We’ll see about that.
---
Lol there is no regularly active WvW player that thinks WvW was improved by adding gliding.
---
If you're newer to weaver you should almost always have either Twist of Fate or Arcane Shield on your utility bar (a stun-break).  In addition to this I'd suggest Fresh Air (Fire/Air/Weaver) that way you can quickly re-attune to air via critical strikes. 
---
Water 2 &amp; Earth (2) are both evades.  However, Water (4) provides frost aura (-10% reduced damage) and a little bit of condition-cleansing capability if you double-attune.  Earth (4) and Earth (5) are both blast finishers.  (4) is a 5 target AoE knockdown.  However, what this also means is that you take blast finishers (eg; Arcane Brilliance Heal) + Water 2 + Earth 4.  You can combo for sustain whilst also doing some offensive CC to bide your time.  
---
I'd recommend learning at least the fresh air portion of the Weaver rotation (Air 3) 2 auto-attack chains, Fire/Air (3, 4, 2) one auto-attack chain (Fire/Fire) 3, 4, 5, one auto-attack chain, (2) into Fire/Water (3) and then Air/Air (3) + 2 auto-attack chains (and loops).  On the Fire/Air (3, 4, 2)'s you can cast either Glyph of Storms (Fire) or FGS (5, 4 and 3) whilst double-attuning back to Fire for extra damage modifiers.  You also try to use things like arcane blast and primordial stance. whilst double-attuned to fire and holding some sort of conjure whether that be FGS or LH for extra stats.  FGS 3 is a nice bit of AoE damage and evades.  
---
[It's honestly one of the simpler higher DPS rotations since it has a really nice loop to it.](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/weaver/sword/) I'd suggest learning the regular/small hit-box rotations first.   Large works for a lot of the bigger bosses, but the problem with Weaver is that it tends to feel pretty sluggish without quickness.  
---
Enjoy the savings! 
---
These posts would also stop if people weren’t ignorant and decided to shit talk something they know literally nothing about 
---
Have WvWers *ever* received a change positively? 
---
The untouched market of wvw players who spend their gems on transferring every week? The fact that they even delayed this announcement is absolutely hilarious.
---
&gt; avian soulbeasts
---
I feel attacked
---
It'll most likely be tied to the ability system like gliding was.
---
1 point to unlock the mount, 5 for the leap attack, 10 for rope siege attack, and 20 for more rope siege damage.
---
As for your other questions, I have no idea.  There isn't enough information to make any kind of educated guess.
---
If it's hard/costly to get it will create a huge imbalance and really put new players off. So I doubt it will be hard to get but they can always fck it up.
---
WvWer love WvW because it's fun , not because it have some awesome reward , even the leg armor skin it's bad unlike PvP's and Raid's
---
I very much do not want rewards for winning a match-up. Winning is entirely based on the population/timezone numbers, which you cannot control except for transfers. 
---
Even alliances will not change this, as winning will be about getting a slot in the best alliance. I can see it already, selling alliance slots like they sell raids (or PvP tournaments apparently...)
---
They gave rewards for winning a long time ago, and it was a bad idea. People were transferring just to get the best rewards, a literal pay-to-win. 
---
WvW is better when it is about doing the best you can with what you have, not about being the ultimate "winning" server.
---
Nothing in WvW uses Mastery tracks, those are PvE content. Its abilities will be locked behind world rank grind like war gliding
---
Then it's what? A slightly faster golem? How is it a good edition to the game? The game mode needs better servers, not a slightly faster golem.
---
Sounds great, one of the reason I don’t play WvW is the maps are a little bit oversized. It’d be nice to speed things up abit. I imagine WvW players who are super used to how things are infuriated, but for most people, WvW is kinda of boring
---
But my rant, we don’t need reasonable responses in this thread. /s
---
Oh, dude, don't be. As long as the other pet is useful, boon-sharing avian soulbeast is a nice build for PuG mayhem groups and small zergs, because of the unholy amount of mobility it has and how much of that it shares. It's like the poor-man's herald. We have a couple of them in [Para] and they're quite popular -- not meta, but popular. I ran one myself, I don't blame you for having fun with it.
---
Of course, the minute you run into anybody with retal or projectile reflect, you kill yourself with your opening attack. When I was running a support scrapper, getting attacked by longbow soulbeasts was what I lived for.
---
&gt; Engage skills dismount the player. At 0:23 the mount factually leaps.
---
In both of the segments of the video where the mount leaps it could easily be dismounting the player?  It cuts away as the mount lands
---
I'm glad people are pointing this out, I was very concerned initially reading this post title. This makes sense.
---
This is definitely not the best step WvW could take, and should be met with skepticism -- but we don't need to make up a controversy where there isn't one.
---
people ask for gvg since 6 years and more incentive to fight players
---
anet gives 1 big pve map with annoying pve npcs, tactics and sieges and now a mount.
---
Shut up.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ascyj2/anet_pulling_a_real_fast_blizzard/egtdha5
---
Don't worry, your gamemode will be empty again soon enough :)
---
Imagine if Anet announced an "exciting raid announcement", everyone gets hyped for a new wing, then they say they're adding friendly fire to instanced PvE. "OH you don't know how it will be implemented, if they do it badly THEN complain!!". People are going to complain, because it shows Anet ignoring what the playerbase has been asking for, no matter how they implement it.
---
and all we actually got is a nothingburger.
---
There is no way this will be balanced for wvw, especially without so little testing.
---
They are completely out of touch with the wvw community.
---
I’m disappointed but let’s not forget we don’t have ANY info on how this works yet.
---
Barriers from the stances I assume? I didn’t notice that when I tried them out initially other than earthen stance, but I’ll take another look.
---
Yep. That jumping skill is just asking to be exploited unless it is hard tied to the ground. If it's anything like the raptor jump it could be used to jump into keeps and towers.
---
That comes down to the player. If you're a roamer, you'll still be able to dismount players by damaging them. Learning how and where to do that is just a new skill to pick up.
---
The only thing i dislike about it right off the gate is that it is not a dolyak.
---
Everything else idc about, i would not even be against it speeding up the wvw play a bit.
---
\&gt; we'd like to have gvg in a game called "guild wars" 
---
the games name refers to the lore
---
Yet the mounts might make breaking into the objective faster... I think we will see more player fights than siege camping. 
---
releasing a mount is one way to "balance" the classes I guess. 
---
Anet doesn't need to.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ascyj2/anet_pulling_a_real_fast_blizzard/egtdiob
---
Stop with the overeager pitchfork grabbing, ffs.
---
In response to why they would have called it a mount when only a few people may be able to get it at as you suggested:
---
Well my theory is, as I mentioned in another comment on this post is that it's essentially this new mount uses the same 'leap' ability as the raptor (look to 0:22 and 0:28 in the video). This might mean that we can also use this mount in PvE instead of the raptor and therefore they have named it as "a new mount available exclusively through WvW". 
---
However, whilst you can use the mount in PvE 100% of the time just as any mount, it probably would not be like that in WvW and instead there will be some catch or limiting factor to its usage in WvW.
---
At least this is what I hope. I know, people are looking to the worst with this mount and I'm certainly hoping that it doesn't turn out to be as you say, 180 people using it all at the same time (lol). 
---
All I'm saying is that it's best to not judge it before next week. Of course I may be totally wrong and you might be right, it might be broken as fuck, but I'm not going to judge it until I try it.
---
It won't be a viable or mechanically compareable replacement though. I did some preliminary testing and the new mount is around Griffon speed on ground, which is even slower than the springer, and its leap looks like it'll have the range of a non-upgraded Raptor leap.
---
This is the only correct answer in this fake drama thread.
---
you realize that it bring absolutely nothing to gameplay right and you'll get bored of it after some days since it gives you nothing
---
:(
---
I'm sure there's more that didn't.
---
YES YES YES YES YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!
---
*MOTHERFUCKINGSQUEEEE!!!!!!*
---
Spending supply for the "rope" that lets you attack gates would make a lot of sense. Can't wait to see what they did decide.
---
Yes...that's why they have been whining about rewards for over 6 years. Makes sense.
---
&gt;  raids, and fractals every month at the very least.
---
Thinking emoji
---
The signet of restoration passive heal triggers on any skill use, which includes weapon skills, utility skills, and swapping attunements. 
---
Lmao, same. WvW is so fucking so slow and boring. Just run across the map for one fight. 90% of WvW for me is just running through places with nothing important in them
---
This is exactly what wvwvw need right now...
---
Like clockwork the babyrage is in full effect because *their* game mode has changed.
---
For those too lazy to search:
---
ask-the-purple-minion: said: @guildwars2​ that is what I want! I don’t care if it have skills or not for PvE, I just want to use it where I want =3c
---
 guildwars2: said: @ask-the-purple-minion​ It doesn’t have any PvE-specific skills, but you can run around with it outside of WvW! :D 
---
Wow, that seems awesome. But where's the hype? No blog post or anything. Basically just a video. Come on...
---
Man calm down, if anything this brings new players to WvW, and we still have no idea how the mount works. I mean even if speed boost is 40% it won't change jack, people already use swiftness all day. Slow classes can finally obtain speed boost without having to wait for cd.
---
Just wait and see, maybe it's good maybe it's shit. 
---
This post is pretty spot on, I would add game performance too though. 
---
Thanks :)
---
You know, people have eyes.. Unless you are deadeye waiting for them in stealth they are going to avoid you with superior mobility...
---
Haha, no offense taken, I was just memeing =P
---
&gt;Of course, the minute you run into anybody with retal or projectile reflect, you kill yourself with your opening attack
---
[Hehe](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Unstoppable_Union)
---
Who the hell cares. Doesn't change anything from the fact that people have asked for gvg since 6 YEARS.
---
Don't worry my dad works at Anet I'll put a sticky note on his door.
---
Souls are basically steroids for wizards.
---
Those are not same videos. The start is different, and one could think that the first one (5 days old) was hidden (and is still hidden) for general public, but handed to the press. Then they uploaded the real video that got also published today. 
---
The question is how the first video leaked and why people vote on it, when the likes/dislikes won't be visible unless you provide direct link?
---
Just another day with some of the players overreacting about something that isn't even in the game.

...The first one has the PEGI rating, while the second one has the ESRB rating.  
---
Come on guys, don't be *this* stupid...  
---
People are so quick to dislike a new addition to wvw. Back when gliders were announced the majority of the wvw community was against it, but since it was implemented rather well most people like it now.  
---
Give mounts in wvw a chance at least, before going out and disliking/hate commenting on everything wvw/mount related.  
---
Try to be a bit more open minded please.
---
This is straight up wrong. One trailer is for EU and one is for NA as others have noted.
---
The publish date is different because of how YouTube works. If you upload a video as private and then make it public the publish date shows when it goes public. If you keep it unlisted (like the EU video) the publish date shows when it was originally uploaded.
---
it all boils down to there needing to be more frequent balance patches
---
everyone bitching about cancer metas, fun fights, "better" balance - it's kinda stupid. there will always be broken classes or strats around, people getting shit on and blaming it on balance, people steamrolling and congratulating themselves for the current balance, etc etc. 
---
**it is not an easy scale to balance**
---
the only way to make people somewhat more agreeable about it is by changing the way things work *often*, which hasn't happened since the pre-hot balance patch. otherwise, the meta becomes stale and crusty within a few weeks, then starts getting moldy when that turns into months
---
personally, all i do is roam, and i'm kinda excited to see what the mount brings -  i don't think they're going to go and golem week it. i've seen reactions that go from "suddenly griffons and beetles in wvw" to "but i want more", but this is the first real thing that could change how wvw plays since they redid objective upgrades. and i'm really bored of how wvw plays at this point.
---
Impact on performance will be minuscule / compareable to what you're already used to - GPU may have to work a bit more, but WvW is a CPU thing anyways.
---
According to my preliminary testing, the move speed of the new Mount is around or slightly lower than the Griffon on ground.
---
&gt; players being put off WvW solely because of long running distances etc
---
I'm one of these.  I had to earn a Gift of Battle for Aurora, and so into WvW i went.  Spawn.  Look at map to figure out where to go.  Walk that direction for 2-3 minutes.  Get killed by a mesmer I didn't even see.  Spawn, repeat.  Total turn-off.  
---
Yeah, I thought you were referring to 1 second after that when it leaps at the camera.  I see it now, good catch
---
The same is true for the dune roller. Why didn't you uninstall before?
---
It doesn't say it's a general purpose mount.  I think it could be another form of siege golem.
---
why they unlisted pegi one? you dont need to unlist any of them.
---
It's not "too lazy," I'm at work and many websites are blocked by filters, so searching would be mostly futile. I'm lucky I can even get on Reddit for when there are lulls in workload here. Asking for a source when someone has clearly just been to a given webpage is not that difficult.
---
Why is the first trailer from february 14th? Never heard anything about this until today.
---
Your question is?
---
Will it fix skill lag? If so, this mount is great
---
I completely understand.
---
I think the main struggle is the long-term neglect, where a lot of the life of the game mode drove dedicated players away. And at this point, it's a question of what will either A) bring them back, or B) inspire new players to step up to replace them.
---
And the go-to idea for a solution by ANet is "let's make more *content,* as opposed to addressing the actual issues. For developers that don't seem to understand their game mode (it took a different direction than they expected since launch, iirc), I imagine they simply don't know what to actually do as developers.
---
And so far making content has not been the answer.
---
But I think I get it now, based on your answer. There's too much filler distracting from the PvP aspects of WvW.
---
I see the charr have finally been tamed and put to good use!
---
Really though. Finally mounts in wvw.
---
No. The patch is coming next week.
---
&gt; A lot of WvW players hated on gliding when that was first introduced, but honestly, it was a great change.
---
is it?
---
it's convenient. you can certainly move around with it faster, so that's a plus.
---
on the other hand, you can also escape fights by jumping off of a cliff/wall/terrain and glide away, that's a negative.
---
so overall, gliding has been a neutral change, which is why there aren't complaints about it.
---
it'd be rather inconvenient, but i for one, do not care AT ALL if gliding in WvW suddenly disappeared. it just doesn't have a big enough impact, both positive and negative, for me to care.
---
i suspect that the warclaw would end up being similar: a neutral change that end up being entirely forgettable.
---
A very small patch later on. Probably black lion market stuff and minor bug fixes. Nothing this week to be honest.
---
There will always be a meta, and it will always be awful.
---
Defense has historically been either OP or impossible, with basically nothing in between.
---
Anet tried rewards for winning matchups years ago with tournament tickets, and everyone hated it because it just made people jump servers and rig matches for rewards. I actually quit playing WvW for more than a year at that point because my server managed to almost push into the tier that would let us buy two weapons, and then we spent a whole month with the two other servers completely ignoring each other in favor of not letting us hold a single objective.
---
Rebalancing PPT so that keeps are better just means that keeps will be the only things that matter, they already have higher PPT than the other objectives as well as the powerful advantage of giving you waypoints if you hold them long enough. Servers should have a chance to win even if they can't hold any keeps outside their own BL. As for giving rewards to taking keeps, tying rewards to anything other than generic participation just means people will set up farms. We saw this in EotM, we saw this with the tournament tickets, we'd see it again with keep bags.
---
I'm pretty sure Anet played around with rewarding points for fighting, and predictably everyone hated it.
---
There's no way to balance the servers without everyone hating it. Anet tried grouping servers, which everyone hated, they announced that upcoming server elimination thing which everyone hated and may or may not have been quietly canceled at some point.
---
When you say you can't imagine a way to balance it, it seems like you mean you can't imagine a way to have it be a low impact change. This could be a big positive change for WvW too. It's possible for gameplay where everyone has a Warclaw and plays around its abilities to be more fun and more enjoyable than what we have now.
---
How likely you think that is depends on your confidence in Anet.
---
Easy: Keep it around to link on social media, but don't have duplicate videos showing up on their YouTube channel. 
---
But more than the Sea... of Sorrows?
---
How is it pitchfork grabbing if I say nothing while waiting for an official statement instead of assuming they are pulling a fast blizzard? 
---
Here we go again with non-WvWers bitching about WvWers complaining.
---
Holy shit YES I am so pumped for this! That mount looks bad ass
---
Don't be so sure. Acquisition seems to be WvW only, but if "WvW is where its skills truly shine", it can likely be used in PvE as well. 
---
It will just not be really useful. 
---
Then you don't really care about WvW if you think this is what it *needed.*
---
thats a good point.
---
i think mesmer is gonna be my pet project, im still a decent way off getting my ranger geared out. 
---
honestly i dont mind the "Malibu Barbie Does Acid At A Rave" part, gonna be a nice change of pace with flashy spells. 
---
Some people are afraid that higher rewards will result in more  "semi-afk farmers", but if you increase rewards primarilyby doing useful stuff (like better loot from lootbags you get for kills - just an example, i know that in worst scenario people can cheese that one with "tanky build for touching players" etc.)
---
You better sharpen your weapons, there will be a lot of lootbags next week.
---
Hello DAOC. I've missed you all these years.
---
WvW is like the hated bratty child of the family that just received socks for christmas
---
dolyak mount would be sooooo cool
---
they did not need to unlist any of the videos. 
---
Thats what is wrong about this picture.
---
As a WvW noob, I can't speak for endless stalemate fights, but I know I don't enjoy "walk for a long long time, suddenly die, respawn and walk for a long long time" very much.  A mount would make me more upbeat about the whole thing, since I could get back to the action faster.
---
I think this is just a wrong move, honest to god. I think the mount looks really cool and has some neat ideas behind it, but I'm also a PvE player. I don't play WvW, and none of the people who talk about WvW issues have ever mentioned needing an exclusive mount to get WvW good attention.
---
 I suppose it remains to be seen how this change goes about, but I honestly think concentrating on fixing balance, rewards, the current meta, and etc is a good idea. A mount doesn't fix that issue. I'd play WvW if it felt remotely engaging or fun -- I don't see how this mount will fix that issue, either.
---
? What's that lol
---
More movement speed equals more fights witch I like tbh, werid saying something positive about a WvW change.
---
Every dual-attack grants a barrier with this setup so you want to use each dual attack every time you're dual-attuned. Since you're constantly weaving between single/dual attunements it comes up pretty often.
---
Both were likely uploaded then. When you make a video public YouTube shows the publish date as the day it was made public. If you upload and keep it unlisted the publish date is the upload date.
---
New life and energy? Heck yeah it does. We have WvW linking because of dying populations. Appeal to more people. Keep the mode interesting and not stale.
---
People are guessing it will be from the fact they didn't say it isn't so I guess no one knows really !
---
I'm kind of hoping it's 100% WvW exclusive, would make it much more special
---
Can it be used to jump into keeps? I can think of Bay at least having spots where a leap of that size combined with mild maneuvering would allow someone to get into bay without breaking anything down.
---
It can also leap like a raptor. [Picture](https://i.ibb.co/QN7w2SC/75-E83-AD4-1741-49-E9-9-A5-B-F1-BAC9947-DFE.png).
---
So it may have some minimal use in PVE.
---
I agree with the balance thing... but i actually seen numerous people posting and asking for mounts in wvw over the years.
---
Yes the conversations went the same way as back in the days where people were asking for mounts in pve (pre PoF), but every so often someone pops up with this whole big "original" idea of his version of what a mounts can bring to wvw.
---
You mentioned you have everything on low - does this include the character model limits &amp; quality?
---
Having dedicated graphics would definitely be a nice-to-have. How much did you pay for the laptop? You could pick up an i7/16gb/1060 gb rig for anywhere from $900-1400 new.
---
Just don't tie those rewards to your server winning, and you avoid the problem I mentioned.
---
Let's have a diacussion on whether you think it will *glide* over water!?
---
Oh that’ll be the day. Imagine competing in guild wars in a game titled Guild Wars 2. I’ll be waiting, Anet. 
---
Istead of base professions i would make wvsw professions with their own unique skills and talents. 
---
Just gemstore sale on mounts, we all love those.
---
&gt;e really mad for a while, getting dismounted by rangers and deadeyes from 1500 when you thought mounts made it harder to get ganked. Thicken your sk
---
I've read this entire thing and thank you for your input lmao. Really hope it doesn't break the game . WvW is already a dying game mode. Hopefully they introduce a new BL
---
I’m assuming you mean for traits? I’ll take a look, thanks.
---
i'd rather give them 20bucks for a paid update than get a mount OMEGALUL
---
Just a bug, use /report and move on.
---
&gt; this is putting me off from wanting to replay the story on my alts for the achievements. I’m even hesitant to start in the next LW chapters because it feels like someone else is taking the credit for everything I’ve done
---
Jesus christ... how are people this frail?
---
Ex player here, never really played WvW. Do I get this right? People are complaining because they get an extra mount, just for this mode?
---
I get why you wouldn't want PVE mounts in WvW, but that's not what Anet did. So why the fuck are people raging? I guess some people always need something to complain about.
---
“Currently, the largest and most reliable method of monetization is over-priced mount skins.”
---
“Ugh, shame they are only available in PvE.”
---
“Hold on.  I just had a... yeah.  I just had an idea.  Get me the artists and the WvW intern!”
---
*Several months later...*
---
“We have looked into the state of PvP and in order to address the issues that have been brought up time and time again, we’ve extended all the maps and have introduced an exclusive PvP mount!”
---
Mounts are great and all, but it’s clear the execs don’t care about fixing problems and bugs that have plagued the game for, in some instances, years now.  Maybe there is a super secret thing they are working on but no communication leads me to worry that we are going to see a huge decline in content that isn’t gem store related post S4.  
---
I hope I’m wrong.  I want so badly to be wrong.  But I’m falling out of love with this game due to poor decision regarding content and monetization of said content.  Maybe I, as a singular player, don’t matter to their bottom line.  But the game industry’s microtransaction economy seems like a bubble ripe to burst.  Whales are fickle.

---
The dune roller is broken from a speed perspective. The only thing stopping it completely breaking WvW is that it is reasonably hard to obtain, and is awful in combat.
---
People acting like this is the only thing ANet has in store for WvW. There can be more than one thing in an update, guys. Maybe they just haven't announced anything else yet, given we do still have a week until it's released.
---
The fear is that it'll make it too easy to get around the Alpine map. A lot of coordinated attacks were based on it taking time to get from one place to another. Mounts are presumed to reduce that time (otherwise why have them other than to look cool? Hey, that's enough for me, I'm sold) .... so coordinated efforts on multiple objectives will be seen as being less likely to succeed. 
---
That sort of thing: waypointing, speeds and distances are vital parts of how WvW works. Which is one reason people complain about trying to defend the red garrison (stoic rampart) - it's very far from spawn, as opposed to the equivalent objective on the alpine map.
---
Anet tries the Activision Blizzard method of unlisting videos with bad feedback.

---
The rating is kinda different there.
---
There is a vouched discord of community guild leaders with a few developers present (mostly NA, but some EU) representing over 1k players via their guilds and there are 3 issues that are near-unilaterally agreed on:
---
* Defender's advantage (for upgraded structures) is crazy out of control powerful
---
* Skill balancing AKA scourge/firebrand is massively overcentralizing 
---
* Population imbalance is awful 
---
Now, alliances are *supposed* to fix the lattermost issue, but the former two issues have been constantly discussed with no development of either on the horizon.  The last updates we have gotten was the stealth trick (that nobody was asking for), and now mounts (that few were asking for)
---
Not sure how this affects me as a roamer. Like I said, if speed boost is on pair with swiftness it's not a big deal. But I'd like to hear why you think that. 
---
&gt; WvW never changes! It's the same in all these years! There's never new stuff.
---
Adds mount for WvW.
---
&gt; OMG FUCKING PVE MECHANICS SUXX FUCK THIS SHIT REEEE
---
Fuck off.
---
Yeah, it felt so rewarding when you pushed someone over a cliff, now... Oh let me glide.
---
One of the strengths about WvW is deciding your own equipment to meet your own style of play. I use zerkers with a a touch of maurders, for example.
---
It’s more a complaint about the fact that the game is... not doing as amazing as it once was, and certain systems are neglected af while things like mount skins, and gemstore in general really, keep getting constant updates. 
---
From that angle it makes perfect sense. The primary gem income for WvW right now is bandwagon transfers (at a guess), so replacing that can only help Alliances happen sooner, if there's an expectation the new system will discourage or deflate that income.
---
Moneymaking game modes get the attention. This pushes WvW into that sphere a little bit.
---
This. I want all of these.
---
Mostly make it more worth my while to play WvW and make it so I can play with people across all servers...
---
what are you talking about they have already announced a new living story coming up.... do you want them to keep talking about it until it comes out? they have regular AMAs and regularly interact with the community. Hype without content is empty and shallow..ask Ubisoft.
---
you should watch jim sterling youtube videos and stop with that bs.
---
an amulet system or something similar would probably be an overall bad change in my opinion. you gain easier "balancing" (pvp's balancing with amulets mostly involves removing them from play altogether) for stats, and easier build swapping/acquisition for players, but you lose the minutiae of min-maxing, severs any link with pve (which some people may like, but it's generally going to reduce player numbers in both modes), and makes 80% of the stats from pve go from "worthless except in wvw" to "worthless" - not to mention carrot-on-a-stick'ing with ascended/legendary items becoming skin only
---
i'd stick to the current system really - i'd say a good chunk of people who are that worried about perfect stats have the means to get them at this point
---
i asked for it... i swear every wvwer is like a toxic 2 hr old tadpole thats about to be snorted by a wild boar.
---
I also hated HoT meta-dependant maps but it's better than nothing I guess.
---
"ANET WE WANT CHANGES TO WVW"
---
\*Gibs mount\*
---
"NO NOT THAT SOMETHING ELSE LIKE uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
---
Are you making full use of your abilities?
---
Water and earth 2 are evades
---
Earth 4 is AoE knockdown
---
Air 5 is frontal cone launch and also an evade
---
Air 2 is single target daze
---
Air+Earth 3 is an frontal cone float
---
Fire+Earth gives barrier plus pulsing barrier
---
If you are soloing then fields and combos can be more reliably used.
---
Water 2 leaves behind a water field. After using that you can switch any of the other elements and use their 2 skill to trigger either a leap finisher or a blast finisher for a heal. They heal for about the same but blast is AoE.
---
Since you just left water your 4 and 5 are now water skills. This gives you a heal on 5 and Frost Aura on 4. Frost Aura gives you 4s of -10% incoming damage and you can transmute it(by using 4 again) for more healing and a bit of damage. Ideally you leave it up then transmute as it is about to expire.
---
I went from ranger to mesmer too and love it. The pace is very different and I felt a bit vulnerable without the pet at first, but once you get to grips with machining out illusions and timing blocks and evades, you're good to go. 
---
Mesmers seem to work much faster and feel generally more chaotic than rangers, who are slow and steady and I really enjoy it. 
---
It's been confirmed on tumblr somewhere. Skills only work in wvw, but you can run around with it in pve.
---
You also keep it up by repairing trebed wall..
---
&gt; that they cannot define themselves
---
It's not really the players' job to be able to properly define their desires. If players are upset, devs are supposed to figure it out.
---
I figure by discussing it blatantly, maybe we can at least get on the same page and refine ideas to make the job easier for ANet. Theoretically, at least.
---
&gt; If ANet is going to add things, they have to be things that are as neutral as possible.
---
lets face it, a mount is as neutral as it will get. Everything else would ruin one part of the gamestyles you listed
---
This strategy works 100% of the time
---
The thing is that what they want they don't get. I mean, honestly, who wanted a wvw mount?
---
Let's be real and acknowledge that anet once again panders to the pvers.
---
Would it be crazy if people waited to use it before exploding in criticism?
---
What a terrible announcement. As someone who plays WvW I'm interested, especially after how well they implemented gliding despite push back, but to provide no information about how this mount will work was a terrible idea.
---
I'm imagining Anet inspiring themselves with EotM mechanics.
---
My bet is on a shrine of sorts at the garrison keeps maybe, which would be the only place one could mount up, if they meet whatever requirements there'll be. The shrine could have only 6 charges or so, replenishing one when an existing mount is removed from the map.
---
On top of not letting people remount the things, I think it'd be sufficiently limited (gated might have been the wrong word), to not have 50v50 mount blobs around the clock.
---
&gt;Those 3 maps are only relevant because of ~~world bosses.~~ content that keeps them relevant.
---
Isn't the entire purpose of this post that we need content and rewards that keep places relevant. If world bosses do that, then that's meeting the requirement.
---
That said, I've also been all over the map for reasons such as exploration, jumping puzzles, daily gathering, map completion, story completion. There are just more reasons to go back to these areas in GW2 than there are to go back to old content maps in WoW or FFXIV.' When you are 120 in WoW, why would you ever go to, say, Winterspring? When you are 70 in FFXIV, why would you ever go to Eastern Thanalan? There is just no reason. Even hunts in FFXIV give outdated rewards for the older areas. If you level up in any of these three games, you see waaaay more people in GW2 maps than the other 2.
---
Again, back to my old point, I am all for improvement. If we can find *more* reasons to get people to go to these maps and reward them for it, awesome. However, it's unfair to suggest that GW2 has been anything less than excellent on this front, in comparison to their competition.
---
At this point, I'm convinced they'll only be happy with getting what they don't get.
---
Gliders were so poorly implemented they had to make map changes.
---
&gt;*Make it (or its skills) cost supply.
---
That's just *begging* for trolls to use it to waste supply.
---
Looks more like a [Nian](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Nian) to me, put in armor with different horn style.
---
But server winning is the main point of WvW. Groups/Guilds that are better, play better, work better together want better and exclusive rewards. They want something to show off, like the crowns or whatever above the head of the best players in PvP.
---
I'm OK with content exclusive to content that doesn't appeal to me. 
---
As a long time WvW veteran who's played since beta I'm really hyped for this. A lot of people have unrealistic expectations for WvW but you all need to stop bitching and let Arenanet make WvW what they want it to be. They've been extremely hindered in the past due to wanting to please the player base but that's basically impossible to do in WvW due to the variety of players that play. Any content is good content. 
---
This brings more lag and Cancer to WvW like I get that they wanna draw the PVE players into WvW but god dang dudes and ladies WvW has been F'ed over for the  past 3 years We didn't want this we wanted a new map a road to the alliance system something to actually get us pumped up to get on this game again other than when we have to raid.

You are playing it wrong as a new player. You should instead follow a commander.
---
If you start roaming you need to at least be competent at PvP, otherwise expect to die a lot. 
---
Solo roaming is harder yet: decent solo roamers won't hesitate to play 1v2 or even 1v3 against less experienced players.
---
That would certainly be interesting. Now you got me dreaming.
---

---
they have plenty of LISTED videos with PEGI ratings
---
As much as I want a new BL (make an aquatic one for Blue map gdi), I don't think that's likely. Integrating EotM into the primary WvW structure as the fifth map is a better move for them that I hope happens soon.
---
Mounts won't break the game. They'll change some aspects of it, but we can also take that as a signal that ANet's pushing down on those aspects to make the mode more accessible.
---
But even if it doesn't break the game, it won't be the thing that revives it either.
---
Last night I made a joke that the wvw announcement would be that we were getting charr as mounts. I didn't think I would be so accurate.
---
As I said, at the moment even if you target a downed ally and stand on a necro portal, you will use the portal.
---
My suggestion is an option. Default keybind stays as it is - you have one key for res, stomp, pick up, use, talk, pay respects, and other extremely different, key game mechanics. 
---
It's more to the general post saying you need anything other than the druid, bs, divinegade and pchronos than to your reply.. yes, you are right on the theorycrafting when you say having ranged dps to clear shards, something to cleanse, etc..
---
But you're forgetting to assume it is possible to hit a dps check that allows the squad to not move from the middle of the platform on both phases and also assuming that people will get hit by mechanics.
---
...In other words, the theorycrafting is for safest squad comp, not for the actual best comp, which necessarily means the same as "the META(Most Efficient Tactic Avaliable) comp". Which requires perfect gameplay but also translates into the fastest possible kill time. 
---
Best team comp never means safest.
---
Just like what dP did with their deimos record (making the offchrono work as a handskiter, although the dps class of choice for dP's record was changed from pchronos to DHs by Meta and is the current world record, the strat is still dP's) or on Matthias (having a THIEF as solo healer and boon generator. Yes, all boons except alacrity, on core thief. Alacrity coming again, from renegades, but this time 2 condi ones. 1 soulbeast with spirits and 1 bannerslave, rest mirages)
---
This comp will likely change once a new balance patch happens, since the power creep shifts towards something else every patch. But generally speaking, Xera is a boss where power dps is stronger than condi dps, so whatever is the best power dps next patch will be the new meta, but with 1 bs 1 druid and, very likely, 2 chronos for boons (or maybe ANet kills chrono for good and we're forced to bring 1 renegade and 2 firebrands just to sub 2 chronos. Yikes)
---
but when they get better rewards (see double exp events) they complain about "pve farmers" coming into "their" mode because the rewards are worth farming now.
---
Good for you.
---
TBH, it's only a money grab if they monetize it. The release of the Warclaw is in-game, not via gemstore, so it won't be that special of a money grab even if/when they add skins to the gemstore.
---
Just base professions wouldn't improve balance, since core specs have been upgraded or downgraded due to elite trait lines. They'd have to reset the game to pre hot for WvW. Very unlikely to happen. 
---
9 classes, 2 specializations each, not to mention 3 different game modes of which one of them has 3? different types (raids, fracdulls and whatever everybody else is doing).
---
I can bet that even after this gamemode will become stale in some months. I think it would be ideal to have what is mentioned in this comment but there is no reason to put down anet for adding mount before trying it out. There are too many people in this community who try to create panic and overreact. 
---
I think mount would be great addition to wvw gameplay as currently it is very boring wrt travel times on big maps and if they implement the mount well then people in future will think how they managed without it. It will be one of those things. Aside from usual balancing issues, if they reworked ui with alliance and make it more intuitive then it would be perfect. I think all these things will welcome new players that will stay long enough to start having interest.
---
I'm just replying to this so I can be in the archived link when it gets posted to subredditdrama
---
Because there's no reason to release a French video with an ESRB rating?
---
I'd imagine it'd be done the same way as gliders, with the siege rope being a higher rank. Each rank being akin to the mount masteries for PvE mounts.
---
This. Guaranteed skill lag in a large blob vs blob. Skill will simply not work at all in a big 3 way fight. We need better servers or lower pop caps.
---
I think we have different viewpoints on what "keeping a map relevant" means. You seem to view it as though players coming there once a day for 5-10 mins is relevance. But I consider participating in various areas or events of the maps as relevance. I don't consider standing around waiting on a boss to spawn and spamming a few attacks as relevance.
---
I'm pretty happy. I don't play organized. I just run around with my holo and fight random people. Only gripe I have is that the grind takes way too long. Pips come too slow. Most of the time I can't cap them because I don't play every day and when I play I play for a few hours max.
---
Also the "reward" tracks are ... well ... I think they forgot to add an /s 
---
I mean I still see lots of different classes roaming in WvW. Mesmers, Thieves, Rangers and Engineers are still popular and effective in small groups or solo. The FB+Scourge comp is only really popular in zergs. 
---
Yo Anet hire this guy he knows how to balance the game. Sarcasm aside, I don’t think you have any clue about balance, because the “Zerg go SMC in 30 secs” applies to all teams. Also, Anet will probably release this, wait a month to see where complaints are, and patch them accordingly. That’s how they balance the game. 
---
Not that unpopular imo. Just the unvocal opinion.
---
Seeing a lot of people claim it will be the death of roaming but I disagree. It's piss easy to get dismounted in PvE as it is. Those roamers and loners going by on this big ass mount are gonna be easy pickings.
---
LMAO this is the GW2 equivalent of announcing Diablo Immortals, man. We asked for a lot of things and they introduce something that wasn't on our top list of priorities.
---
More frequent balancing. 
---
Reduction of power creep. 
---
An actual incentive to win rather than to just play. For example in sPvP it's 3 pips vs 10 pips for winning, wvw could even do 1, 2, or 3 pips for having completed wood chest on a server depending on server placement last week for a simple start. Maybe bonus rewards for holding or capping keeps.
---
Don't stand on the portal 4Head I know it's an issue, however it's a minor one, and i hope anet never change the game mechanics to accommodate lower skill.
---
$20 for a paid WvW only update would split the playerbase, further emptying out servers on both the freebie side of things and the paid half. Else, you'd be selling an advantage for $20. Both of those options are significantly less than ideal, compared to a universal mount and gemstore shinies.
---
Better *Tame* the Disconnection you have with your active playerbase.
---
Saved to copy paste everywhere.
---
There was a twitter link.
---
You can answer to that comment then, it makes no sense without context.
---
have you looked at the number of players since gliding was added? they used to only merge 2 servers together.
---
To be fair there's no "regularly active WvW player" that thinks anything ever added to WvW to change its stagnant nature improves it.
---
1. In PvP and WvW a matter of 2 seconds that take you to notice you are on a portal and move yourself away from it is often a lose condition. 2. There's no indicator on the portal what the 'use radious' is, so the only way is to keep your eyes on the pop-up, and there's a lot of more important stuff to look at during an encounter.
---
3. For reasons unknown portal doesn't show very often or is covered by other move visible AoEs like Lava Font or wells.

In the notes for the GW2 Tumblr post (http://guildwars2.tumblr.com/post/182917106213/behold-a-mobile-cattering-ram-%E0%B8%85%E1%90%A0%E1%86%BD%E1%90%9F-calling):
---
*guildwars2 said: @ask-the-purple-minion​ It doesn’t have any PvE-specific skills, but you can run around with it outside of WvW! :D*
---
Lol, they are crazy if that's true.
---
Is it normal to have abysmal load times (not on loading screens but of the actual assets and such) when you use the mod for the first time? Because it can take up to a couple of minutes or so for buildings, lighting, characters, etc. to load in after I downloaded this mod.
---
Okay, heres my simple take: 
---
Make it simple, keep it up to HoT professions and not the new PoF(I dont know if this makes a big difference)
---
Then, provide a dedicated WvW balancing team.  Or even, revert it back to before HoT, **original classes only.**
---
Then we can focus on mechanics of WvW as a whole. Better GvG's with less time focusing on what class and builds to play. If we keep it simple, then we can focus on enjoying the game more.
---
Right now it feels like WvW is in a state of 1v1's. 
---
Why? I am 100% pretty sure, a lot of dedicated WvW'ers are buying a lot of gems with real money. Im pretty sure Anet makes a lot of money from WvW'ers. How about reinvest that back to WvW'ers?
---
End of the day, this game belongs to a company. Companies seek to make profits. Im sure you get good income revenue from WvW players, especially the dedicated ones. I know of many spending 1000's of dollars into this game to convert it into gold.
---
You don't play much wvw do you?
---
They should just combines their powers and summon Captain Planet already.
---
Veterans don't own the game mode though even if they think the do.
---
I wouldn’t characterize my response “frail” as you put it. More like disappointment at the game making such an obvious and (presumably) easily fixable mistake. I think you might be projecting your own views on the larger discourse on gender identity, pronouns, etc. I could be wrong, of course—I just don’t think it warrants the level of exasperation your statement conveys.
---
&gt; The Warclaw comes with three special abilities that will enhance your WvW gameplay. The first is Battle Maul. When you jump into battle while mounted your Warclaw will maul your enemy before it disappears. This is your standard attack and dismount move.
---
The second ability is Chain Pull and from a WvWer’s standpoint possibly the most exciting of the three abilities. Those on Warclaws will be able to help pull down gates to gain entrance to whatever structure the zerg is currently focused on. This is an advanced ability which almost certainly means that it will have to be unlocked. As of writing this, pre-embargo we don’t yet have that information.
---
The final ability is Evade. Get a quick burst of speed and evade attacks allowing you to break through enemy lines. This will be especially useful in Castle sieges where getting a team through the hall quickly to attack from behind will add a very interesting new element to the event.
---
It’s so odd.  SC is about efficiency and speed, assuming players are good enough to not die to basic stuff.  Heal scourge is meant rez people fast, which is counter intuitive to their play style.  So they build it to do as much damage as possible while still being a heal scourge, which ends up being awkward as rick to the build
---
Big diffrence between insta respawns and three minute runs across a map especially on dead maps where you cross paths with literally no one.
---
Is this the part of the outrage where WvW'ers pretend they are above PvE players with their carebear PvP?
---
Yeeeeah. So, I'm not disagreeing to you, but there's a limit to how well these systems can detect things with accuracy. Repair in general is a "helping your team" activity. What I meant by that first line was, to a player that doesn't know what they are doing, in their mind it is helpful. The determination that repairing an actively trebbed wall is unhelpful comes from users, not the system.
---
Case in point "Kill the treb then repair." Is that a hard and fast rule? If a treb has ever hit the wall should we not hand out points until that treb is dead? What if it still exists and is pointing at that wall, but has not hit the wall in 20 minutes? 5 minutes? You're getting into some silly situations where at the very least people are getting penalized for not having foreknowledge about an area they just arrived in.
---
yeah, bunch of angry virgins. had to close chat.

Yeah as I said, the portal issue is a known one, as a necro main it's quite annoying, however my main concern is separating revive/stomp keybinds, as I've said already, significantly lower Marco skill level, so iam going to go with this logic, the scourge portal isnt working as intended or maybe should work like mesmer portal in terms of interaction, but either way giving them their own keybinds is not an option in my opinion.
---
Hope and expectations have nothing to do with my comment.
---
This is wvw and everyone against mounts are for this kind of gameplay. Now you will ask how people can be this stupid? Yes they can be. When they played they gamemode certain way for everyday for multiple years, they will bitch and moan if there is even a smallest of change in their gameplay. Be it for better or worse, which they find out later.
---
The poll is not counting 'neither' entries, seems like.
---
My hype level is more 'Eh, ok, it was bound to happen' than hard yes or no.
---
Seems like a good boost to gameplay. I doubt any of the abilities is overtuned because of the need to buy the expac but we will see. I anticipate that'll be the bigger problem with the community as people without the expac will be at a disadvantage in WvW, but I personally think that's ok. 
---
1. This is the PoF expansion only; specifically, you will get mounts, elite professions of PoF, and maps.  Notably with HoT, you will not have access to gliding.
---
2. If you plan buying gems with the expansion, getting the items (comes with a lounge) and the gem discount is a very good deal over buying them separately. 
---
Also, the Invitation to the Lily of the Elon is a nice item, especially in a shared inventory slot.  It's an easy way to get to that corner of the world and has a full set of lounge amenities.  If you not planning on spending gems or want to be frugal with the money spent, getting the normal game and spending the extra money on gems may get you other items you want for the money.  The Mistlock Sanctuary is arguably the best lounge in the game.
---
It was a good investment for me.
---
I'm excited but dunno about hyped. I'm gonna wait to see them reveal more info about how it actually works and what's required before I get hyped.
---
OP
---
Happy cake day.
---
Thats basically spellbreaker, it was a well thought out class that got nerfed still 
---
Oooh, I want EotM to be useful, give it pips and/or put it in the matchup.
---
Im not completly against the mount, we'll see what it does, where its useful. Then I'll love/hate it.
---
Like I said, we don’t know how his will be implemented.  If it’s on par with swiftness it won’t.  If it’s the current speed of normal mounts it will. 
---
Oh man, wvw release and they answer one question that doesn't relate to wvw.
---
Thread removed: Duplicate post, please check the recent posts for a similar one and use that. This includes making a comment post about a another post.
---
Invul does sound nice. If I find a cool looking foci I’ll give it a try. I’m going sword and dagger purely for the coolness factor XD
---
Us WvW players like the game mode for the large scale PvP. At it's core GW2 is good because it has a very solid combat system - mounts detract from player skill.
---
Mounts will inheriantly break balence, it removes the need to consider build engage speed, and lessens the importantance of kills in a fight.
---
We don't want recycled PvE content designed to push gem sales. Fixing performance and balence issues would have been a much better received, instead we get something none of the veterans will want.
---
And lets the be fair, the influx of new players will dry up quickly. So many people in PvE play simply to get skins, or min-max raids: they don't enjoy PvP. WvW players have only remained because they enjoy the gameplay and community.
---
It’s not “frail,” it means a lot for people to have their character’s likeness fucked up. Pronouns are an important identifier and characters are often self inserts. It’s totally reasonable for *anyone* to get miffed by this
---
I've read enough modern fantasy lit to know that all you need to make a god is extreme amounts of belief.
---
The only way to kill a zerg is if you had bigger zerg rn. So you can farm bags there more frequently now. Ez.
---
There is a "Neither" option
---
&gt; - Do you guys not have Pof?
---
&gt; - Yeah, you guys have PoF, right?
---
XDDDD
---
In any case, this has been likely on the works for quite some time. Whatever resources it took to make this mount quite probably didn't affect other WvW developments. 
---
What WvW needs the most? 
---
* Balance.
---
* Population.
---
* Occasional novelty without drastic game-breaking changes. 
---
I really doubt a mount animator or the designer of the mount's skills would be much help with any of that. 
---
As for this "creeping PvE" people claim to have in WvW, I'm afraid there's nothing that can be done about that. WvW is "competitive gameplay in a PvE environment".    A combination of PvP and PvE. By definition, it's not possible to have WvW without PvE.    
---
NPCs will never be removed from it, and there will be always people who avoid player fights in favor of farming NPCs.  
---
Imagine if they replaced all NPCs with player roles. Player disconnects, then what? Lord role passes to another player? And what happens when the keep runs out of players? And what if a player is a spay and basically lets himself get killed by his friends?  
---
NPCs are there to solve problems such as those. So the Mist War can still go on even if players are currently unreliable. 
---
In fact, paradoxically, the only way to make WvW less PvP would actually be adding even more PvE.  
---
How so?  
---
The maps are rather large, and they can have a lot of people, and outnumbering the enemy is a tactic that works more often than not.  Squads that can consistently defeat squads of larger numbers are few, so people tend to band together, and that actually reduces fights to mostly blobs v blobs and opportunistic roamers catching players trying to reach their respective zersgs.  
---
In an ideal WvW situation, we'd have many different groups all over every map of several different sizes. Smaller groups going for smaller objectives, and banding together for larger ones like keeps and towers.  But zerging works so well and there's so little reasons to stick around and defend lesser objectives, that people stick to zergs and trying to capture faster than the enemy in kind of a "musical chairs" kind of style, only focusing on defense for objectives that are easier to defend or more valuable, like keeps and towers closer to the home base.  
---
To actually have a wider range in the size of parties and fights, there would have to be better reasons to stick around objectives other than staying as a lookout, scouting and throwing siege disables to make time for the blob.  
---
The Righteous Indignation buff can't be removed or people could stick to one spot retaking a place over and over, and harassing outnumbered players until they give up, so the reason to stick around can't be because enemy players will stick around and take it back again right away.
---
And since it's impossible to keep players everywhere, the only solution left would is NPCs.  
---
For example, there could be a 4th NPC faction that would regularly recapture any location left undefended by players for long enough, like Aetherblades, for example, that would force players to stay behind defending supply lines.
---
And that would have the added effect that whenever you get to any objective, you'd be more likely to find other players already there defending it, thus increasing how often players meet each other, and the frequency of Player vs Player fights. 
---
Something like that would work even better with more distributed player populations at all times, so it'll only be plausible after the alliance rework. But if it was done right, it would definitely spread players more and cause players to meet each other more often, thus strangely increasing PvP by adding more PvE. 
---
The only way we could get pure PvP would be having PvP arenas guilds can use for GvG, designed for larger groups like 10v10 and 20v20.  
---
What does that have to do with it? You can't think of a scenario where, I dunno, red owns red EBG keep fighting green or blue on vista hill only to jump off the edge and glide to get OOC?
---
It reminds me of how khajiit have different physical forms, and one of them is big enough to be a mount
---
The Warclaw is just a senche-charr
---
There are plenty of things players have been requesting for WvW and a mount is not one of them.
---
Smart, since Griffon is the slowest land-mount. You wouldn't want a mount with a raptor or jackal level speed in WvW
---
Before boarding the Shining Blade boat (the one where you need a boarding token, I forget which story step it is) I got called a She but my character is a very fucking manly boy charr lol. Shocked me
---
DOWNVOTED BY ALL REMAINING PVP PLAYERS :D 
---
FUCK ME
---
Yeah same. Was so much fun when Juggernaut gave toughness + stability but at the cost of reduced speed. Gave it such a cool tank feel. Healing Turret + bunch of elixirs and you could just camp it all day. Would love to go back to that. 
---
I would love to see state of the game articles from Mike Z at least every episode. Even them echoing that they know about issues we all talk about is very reassuring.
---
Kinda yeah, this thing looks dope and it speed up WvW dailies. 
---
Gods left their realms (underworld being one of them).
---
When balth killed you, you were really really dead, a soul in the underworld to stay for eternity. 
---
The ONLY reason why you could come back to life is because you remembered who you were,and was able to defeat the eater of souls, of which you got some spark of life and the reaper (not grenth) was able to kick you back in the real world.
---
I dont think they will send aurine in the underworld to remember her name and kill another eater of souls and then somehow return her "soul" back into the impaled branded husk of her body ...
---
For sure :P I had a lot of fun with dagger too. The two main notable losses was the lightning jolt (i think 4 on dagger air), and circle of fire. That said, 4 fire on focus is a line of fire that is comparable in effect, and 2 on air sword lets you teleport to your foe for mobility.
---
That said, I am no expert. This is just my personal open world experience.
---
But that's not what WvW is. WvW, at its heart, is a persistent version of Alliance Battles. That involves large-scale PvP, yes, but it focuses on objectives.
---
Of course they want rewards for that.  How do you give it to them without creating a p2w situation where people simply transfer to the winning team?
---
&gt;I am 100% pretty sure
---
No you aren't. You're just assuming that anet gets a massive amount of income from WvW. There's not really any evidence for that being true, and if anything I'd assume the exact opposite.
---
That strategic ele down for the lava font to rally
---
&gt; Jesus christ... how are people this frail?

;)
---
&gt; I doubt any of the abilities is overtuned because of the need to buy the expac 
---
Hasn't stopped them yet
---
If your only goal is to look for “challenging content” then you’re playing the wrong game my brother. And if you’re looking for “rewarding content”, you’re still looking at the wrong game. You can only find a challenge in wvw and pvp and atm neither are in a great spot. And the most rewarding content is gems&gt;gold. 
---
That they didn't mention any limitations is concerning.
---
That Evade skill is gonna make holding chokes a fucking joke.
---
You might, but then there will be the other half of WvW'ers that will cry about how it will be so much easier to siege objectives and build siege.  
---
YB would just about have a heart attack at the thought of being able to build more siege ^^^/s ^^^issa ^^^joke
---
Mount is most likely gated behind ranks (like other masteries).
---
Skill 2 may use suplies and skill 3 just endurance.
---
Pvp?pve?
---
Have you ever considered to just get legendary equip and never need to farm materials on balance patch again? 
---
Well certainly doesnt translate into "massive" amount of income, I wont attack your statement though as my opinion doesnt really matter. Lets go back focusing on WvW! bring peace and glory please
---
I wouldn't say escaping is bad.  WvW is a forced game mode if you want a legendary, and the pvp is irritating.  If I chase someone off, good.  If I can escape and mind my own business instead of being lobbed a thousand miles away, good.
---
You must be a new reaper player, huh?

\^ that.

https://massivelyop.com/2019/02/19/guild-wars-2-is-releasing-a-new-cat-mount-but-only-through-world-vs-world-pvp/
---
“Providing players with a whole new way to travel and explore the Mists, the Warclaw can only be obtained in World vs. World, but can be summoned anywhere other mounts are able to be summoned. This new mount comes with a variety of special abilities including Evade, Battle Maul and Chain Pull, with each ability having been specifically designed to enhance existing WvW mechanics.”
---
So we can use it out in pve, just have to go get it in WvW.
---
I mean...mesmers can portal bomb anyways. Thieves can stealth and evade right through the entire zerg damage.  Many classes can tank as well. It's not hard to reach and grind the rear end of the enemy zerg. Of course it makes it easier, but also opens up the ability to make plays. I'm really excited to see how it all works.
---
"discussing the changes" made me remember about the guild talks..
---
those streams about every incoming elite specs, i miss them a lot, hope someday we will get them again even for balance, before they ships them, not after.
---
Both tbh. I know Mirage is busted in PvP, but i can't comment on that because I dont play PvP.
---
Why don't they tell us information about it now? I'm not sure, maybe a marketing thing trying to get people to tune in to Twitch?
---
This is how Anet views the WvW community. 
---
A max of 2 players utilizing a new seige mount, because litterally one else plays that game type anymore. 
---
Well played. 
---
Plot twist, this character is in truth a mesmer.
---
That's the sense of the Borderlands. You are supposed to have an advantage on your HBL
---
Nice.  
---
Guild golems cost 50 supply. That's one for every 2 players with the supply cap. On top of that you can buff them. You can disable golems, but they stay disabled significantly less long than other siege. 
---
A mount with the speed of a raptor is an issue in itself. 
---
I’m honestly kinda excited about this mostly so I just don’t have to spend so much time running around looking for things to do in WvW, it almost gets frustrating just walking around when you’ve been riding mounts all through PvE, and wasting a bunch of time if you can’t find anyone. I can definitely see this changing the pace of WvW though 
---
All I want to know is if it auto dismounts when you get hit or not. Especially with that Evade skill in play.
---
&gt; The real issue is that when changes happen, people who are happy with it will be in game enjoying it. The ones that aren't will be on the forums blowing them up.
---
An extremely good point about online gaming communities in general. 
---
And the Reddit cycle of love/hate begins once more.
---
they can range from complete washes (buffing underused skills coefficents but not changing functionality, see shatterstone memes) to interesting (skills being reworked, like guardian elite tombs turning into the elite signet/shout, mesmer mimic going from a projectile block/launch to a utility repeater), to forcing significant workarounds (any chrono change in the last year basically), to destroying builds (lava font), completely ignoring an issue or fixing it worse (scrapper), etc etc.
---
generally, one spec will get some good quality of life, two or three might get some decent trait changes, one will get minor nerfs, one will get a single major hit and some underused skill buffs, and the rest will all be flyover states
---
Don't worry mesmer will be fine even with nerfs. They wont remove instacasts,mobility,stealth,invuln,target break,clone spam and damage all at once.
---

what is a decent and cheap wvw build for zergs?
---
Sounds like a lotta hooplah
---
So... anything could happen, lol. Thanks for the insight!
---
Yes, the God of Pips and Gud Deeps. Froggo himself.
---
Good changes:
---
Auto loot
---
Improved rewards
---
Structure upgrade revamp
---
Tactics
---
The final iteration of bloodlust
---
Squads
---
Recent balence patches a step in the right direction
---
EB tower restructuring
---
Notice how all of the above improve gameplay? Gliding is a mixed bag still due how it allows abuse of height difference when in combat.
---
Poorly received changes:
---
Siege events
---
Stability change
---
New borders filled with PvE content and a lack of fighting areas
---
Revealed from guards putting another nail in the coffin for roaming
---
Bad balence patches breaking the entire game mode for months at a time
---
Still a lack of incentive to win matchups.
---
Matchup balence.
---
I don't disagree with you either here. I know of all of these problems and it bothers me but I also see that players seem to want too much of this game, "There is nothing left to do in the game" but spent thousands of hours playing it.
---
There are players still complaining that Dungeons are not supported anymore while completely disregarding the fact that they took too much time from the devs to maintain them and a very static concept to expand them.
---
I get that this game has issues, a lot, but damn you can't do right by some players.
---
stop stealing my banners! i use them for my rotation!
---
Some of the achievements were very hard to get.  I was one champ away from getting all of them.
---
For those who didn't take part in the fight.  You had 5 lanes you had to defend, much like in Silver Wastes.  And then one by one each lane was selected to fight the champs.   There were five identical champs that needed to be killed.  So the players in the lane were divided onto five platforms that couldn't interact to kill the champs.  If one of the platform fights failed to kill the champ in 2 minutes the fight went to the next lane.  And of course the players got a debuff so you couldn't fight the champs again for a while.
---
I had bad luck during those two weeks.  I got the first four champs but could never get lucky with the 5th champ.  I got good enough to almost solo that champ on my own, but always.... always one of the other platforms failed.
---
Other than that, TM was one of my favorite bosses.  The breachmaker was also fun.  Unfortunately the thing I remember the most was the 3 days they turned off loot, because people were farming it.
---
Agreed, it's not fun, and I imagine it's a major reason people stop playing. I wonder how people would react to a respawn timer? That's another way you can prevent instant reinforcing of fights while allowing fast travel times once you're back on your feet.
---
Well, just know that HoT maps are intentionally more difficult than anywhere else in pve (including PoF). 
---
It will improve a lot over time though, not just because of your growing skill, but also because you'll unlock more and more Masteries, like the one that lets you detect stealthed creatures in HoT maps. (Those HoT sniper froggos will die to your burst before they get to channel their attack, *especially* on Sw/D Weaver)
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Oh and if I'm allowed to give advice for open world trait combinations (especially for Sw/D Weaver), Equip Air spec and use all the middle ones. Amongst other things, it allows you up to 6 seconds of Superspeed on demand, as long as you land a crit (zerk gear + all skill/trait modifiers will get you very near to 100% crit chance). Being able to quickly reset to full Air has tons of benefits, and it might just help newer players if they have something to fall back on if they feel a bit lost in all the semi-attunements. 
---
Fire spec is a must though, the Persisting Flames grandmaster is a life saver (vapor form allows you to cast a 2nd downed lava font if you wait out the internal cooldown, it's great). If you get the s3e4 chapter of Living World (Head of the Snake), it comes with a Mastery that makes it all 10x better. Just having 3 mobs on top of you is enough to see yourself getting up again after ~1 second! Besides, the traits forces the combo system onto you, which is pretty damn important for eles.
---
Believe it or not, people actually complained about not having to pay for upgrades because reasons. Apparently it made defense too passive but like really?
---
Rewards-wise WvW has done much better. The reward and pips system means that you don't have to go on a class with spammable AOEs and tag everyone since the bulk of the rewards come from the tracks and not from tagging enemy players or guards. In addition, the global change of support = credit has helped matters.
---
The main problem about WvW is most likely the lack of dedicated skill balance. Changes meant for another game mode tend to have negative effects, and one of the biggest disasters was the nearly worthless stability at the start of HoT which turned the game into a staring contest. 
---
Certainly, regardless of game mode one plays, being hit by nerfs/buffs meant for an entirely different game mode is pretty annoying. WvW has seen the least changes meant for it.
---
Granted, the nature of fights also changes with numbers, and it is hard to decide what an average fight in wvw should look like, and be balanced upon. It'd be nonsensical to balance around 1v1 situations, for example, and any system that wants to account for all these possibilities will inevitably fall apart. 
---
I think that's amazing! Can't wait to try it out and see what it brings to this game mode which is dead for years now, so why not...
---
The Asura NPC in Mistlock Observatory tells you how to get started!
---
And you acting like it's nothing means that you just want to create needless drama to get your micro epeen erect.
---
Fwiw, all this derogatory name-calling only validates my point that you're the only one mad here.
---
It's cool though, you do you bro :) Whatever makes you feel better.
---
Hop on the [Karma Express Cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vIoGp3R7ZI)
---
1v1s and 2v2s in PvP don't have an impact on the main 5v5 conquest game mode (neither do 5v5 stronghold or the deathmatch maps that I didn't even know existed). In WvW, everyone has to share those maps.
---
I think that PvP matches are actually a good comparison though. To me, organised GvG in WvW maps feels very similar to that one guy in a PvP match who just keeps duelling other players far away from any map objectives. If you want to GvG, there's the guild arena, the large space in the Obsidian Sanctum, and that other space that got added last year somewhere. They're not all great but they do have their place.
---
Wvw is not about zerg teamfights, if it is then where is my ranger balance on the basis of teamfights? ;)
---
I couldn't agree more with your statements, I also find that I only play GW2 when a new story comes out and that's even predictable. In my spare time I have started to play GW1 again and was recently playing some of the bonus backstories to Turai Ossa, Gwen and Master Togo. It made me realise that I do not actually know hardly any backstory to Rox, Braham, Rytlock apart from the events of GW2 Personal Story and Seasons.
---
I love the GW Franchise, but GW2 is becoming boring to me now.
---
I wish people would give me socks for Christmas.
---
They indeed do agree. 
---
If you read carefully through most suggestions, they have mostly two clear messages: 
---
* "This is not fun/right, it should be changed so it's fun/right". 
---
* "I want me and my favored plasystyle to gain/maintain advantage over everyone else's."
---
Since it's a competitive game mode, one clashes with the other, since it's impossible to keep it fun while also keeping gimmicks working.  
---
But as soon as they get changed, you get typical "Worst change ever, everything is ruined, now my profession is useless" wails of painful denial. 
---
The Guild tactivators where received pretty possitively.
---
Most commanders just dont have the patience or desire to place a treb far away and clear def, like you said if you only place katas/rams and not gonna make it into whatever you are attacking ofc it seems OP that 5 people can defend something.
---
I think it's mostly raid/high-end fractal meta complaints. "Chrono does everything" sorts of chatter. And because Chrono has so much going for it (tank, boon spam, damage), it hurts when it gets nerfed. 
---
Balance is and always will be a joke due to how the game is inherently designed around small scale combat, but it is worse in wvw due to the following:
---
 * Consumables (food/utility) that have huge impacts on build performance.
---
 * Stat combos that tilt risk vs reward on a number of builds.
---
 * No standardization of equipment
---
The main thing the game (as a whole) needs is more frequent balance.  Small changes more often.  When something is blatantly broken in a competitive game it should not stay that way for **months.**
---
Because most of PVE is meant to be solo'ed, you have to be powerful enough to take on enemies with a million HP and live to tell the tale.  That power level doesn't translate well against other players with 20k HP.
---
Well the dps variants can get quite ridiculous tbh
---
Well, I'm not saying players don't know what they really need, but I think Anet has a bigger image about what they think is necessary and what is not. 
---
My initial comment was a bit snappy though so please excuse me if lack of understanding the situation made it sound ignorant.
---
Regarding Immortals: I think the game could have been a big success if they actually announced something different like D4 too and didn't make an entire event out of a mobile game.
---
But I'm pretty sure the warbeast will get a good reputation and players will enjoy it once it's fully implemented. And no, I'm not hired by Anet :P :D
---
That's a lot...smaller than I expected.
---
No mounts in wvw. 
---
People in DR mapchat were saying Anet only introduced mounts in WvW so people would buy more mountskins and I'm inclined to agree. I stopped buying gems recently, and I'm going to stick to this. I'm not going to spend a single cent on these stupid mounts. Especially since them introducing mounts into WvW pissed me tf off. Anet always looks at ways to possibly make more money instead of actually improving the game. I'm done with subsidizing their bad behavior.
---
Looks like we can still use it outside of WvW, too, which is good. 
---
You can pretty easily get rid of that problem by having repairing the same wall count less and less for contribution until it stops maintaining it after a few minutes. Repairing any wall in the same location only counts for a bit longer, and now you can avoid punishing people for helping while still punishing people who are abusing the system.
---
And so what? Give us a button to matchup vs another guild within the wvw panel and it's done. 
---
Queue the squad, get ported in arena, engage on timer.
---
How would any of that impact wvw? 
---
You can always stat change your ascended armor if need be, it's never a waste
---
Actually I totally expect ANet to drop the ball on this by not releasing something that would help keep the people they will inevitably manage to get into WvW with this. They'll just squander the opportunity.
---
I understand no one at anet actively plays WvW as a main gamemode but making decisions like these without having a grasp on what the player base actually wants will be the final blow to the gamemode. The idea of mounts alone will reduce map dynamics, give the biggest blob more mobility and give ranged classes a massive advantage. I didn't think it could get much worse til I saw the mount being used as siege. Will supply even be needed anymore? Is WvW going to be completely different and more casual cause of mounts? Most likely and I won't stick around to find out..   
---
Sincerely one of the last active wvw commanders in the game
---
&gt;Better siege balance. Trying to take a T3 keep is nearly impossible. 5 people can defend 50 on T3.
---
Do you think that maybe adding some way for players to, say, throw a rope at a door and help tear it open would make defending harder?
---
People really like kittens in the WvW forum right now..
---
$20 to earn pips and regular WXP/karma while playing EotM
---
easy money
---
and the support variants... and the wvw variants...
---
No one said it was alright!
---
The whole issue is that this mount doesn't even touch the problem the game mode has. It just shows that the devs have no clue what the game mode is about. What people like about it. We don't need a stupid mount. We need to fix server bandwagoning. We need to fix the stale meta. We need to fix the boon spam. We need to fix the gliding exploits that enable players to bypass entire gates.
---
Fuck man.
---
I feel like this is going to be as fun as Golem Week...
---
Can't wait for literally nothing to change B)
---
If you main Chrono/Mesmer then you definitely need to look into Legendary gear.

HoT maps are weavers nightmare so get used to it. My advice is make your specs to Air + Arcane + Weaver. On arcane you want 1 or 2 / 3 / 1. The middle trait is a lifesaver in most occasions and will help you alot in PoF. HoT is really hard though. Also for utility skills use the weavers evade skill which is also a stunbreak. Saves you from alot of sticky situation. 
---
When using water 2 switch to earth immediately and use Earth 2 for aoe blast heal. Fire and earth have really good synergy with might stacking. Good aoe combo. Air is mostly c/c. I recently leveled a fresh ele and moved to weaver. I played alot of core maps first to understand what works well for me I recommend you do map completion with it before HoT or PoF.
---
Buckle up boys, best human god coming through!
---
That post isn't really saying anything though? The OP asked: "Please spell it out for me: What do WvW players actually want?" and replying "jUsT fiX tHe gAmE!!" is not an answer.
---
I'm also genuinely curious to see some ideas, but don't see any, just another rephrased diagnosis of the issues. 
---
&gt; An actual incentive to win rather than to just play
---
I agree with what you said. Plus I would add a suggestion I read the other day. Guild stats for death/kill, camps/keeps captured e.t.c with a guild leaderboard.
---
Weaver actual can have lots survivability if you want. Almost impossible to die, look at wvw or pvp builds for weavers, for example:
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Weaver_-_Celestial_Roamer
---
So if you want easy run in open world/story you can run something similar to that but if you want play fractals/raid you will need to learn to play zerk ele that die when something looks at you if you don't kill it first.  
---
Better skill balance. Right now the meta is 3 specs. Fb scourge herald. Diversity is dead. 
---
better population balance.
---
An actual fix for ppt. Night pvd'ders winning entire matchups on their own.
---
Tournaments or some type of gvg support system.
---
Even things like guild halls having wvw version of skill balance for gvgs 
---
The list goes on honestly. Most wvw don't want pve crap in wvw because wvw is not pve. But yet every change we get seems to be more towards pve'rs who rarely even come into wvw to farm their gift if battle.
---
no keep is safe now, 200+ warclaws hitting your doors and boom, youre gone
---
It's all in how you present it.
---
If Anet had announced server updates, balance changes, and map changes to ensure the mounts wouldn't break the game, then also announced the mounts, I'd be cheering for this.
---
But no. It's the cherry on top sort of thing, but instead of the cake you only get the cherry. 
---
Of course I'm disappointed. That cherry could be juicy and sumptuous, but I wanted a cake. I asked for a cake. I specified what sort of cake I wanted, and why I wanted it. 
---
And Anet looked at every wvwer's reasonable requests for a cake and said "hmmm well here's a cherry"
---
&gt; That dimishes incentive to buy mount skins for it by a huge margin.
---
A very good point, I've never been one to prioritise the economic side of things, so I didn't even consider it. 
---
I suppose it boils down on the decisions made then, whether WvW balance is more important than monetized cosmetics. Time will tell!
---
Never! /s
---
Which is being removed.
---
Make renegade might skill instead give quickness, then they can take over the boonshit meta from chrono.
---
Already can give a permanent moving alacrity  just give us the quickness for fuck sake, the class is designed for quickness yet totally lacks a way to get it meaningfully
---
It'd be a waste more on a personal level. I already had a set of light armor ascended, but wanted to keep the assassin/zerker set for my Chrono. I decided to make a 2nd light set in viper for Mirage, at the expense of starting to gear up my medium armor for my Soulbeast. It's definitely a very "that's my problem" sort of thing, but just clarifying what I mean.
---
True.
---
I just wish Arenanet wouldn't spend the time developing for WvW, when we already know that no matter what they add, the players are going to hate it and rage. Seems like a waste of effort.
---
If you did you’d be a god
---
A lot of people actually thought that the Desert Borderlands would work better with gliding (and it does). I saw it as inevitable, really. 
---
Also the forums are salty because they're filled with players that don't play the game anymore and are there because... I dunno. Apparently that's a common thing these days. 
---
Not enough gems and not frequent enough.
---
this time i dont care about the balance just make the wvw mount a good implementation
---
We value different things, and that’s ok. It IS hurtful how you have devalued what is important to me, though. Thanks for the interaction.
---
shrug... who playes staff ele nowadays
---
Better dps = faster runs = less mechanics involved = safer with more probability of success, e.g your VG experience will have less greens and less seekers, reducing risks of screwing up the mechanics that will potentially wipe your team. 
---
I mean sure if you want to play a reaper or any other non meta class thats also fine as long as you can do decent damage compared to your team. 
---
But so far all the pugs that join as reapers are those that dont know what they're doing and only do 7k dps. 
---
&gt; but at least there is more talk about communicating the reasons why they change certain things
---
where are you getting that from?
---
This article is currently the most detailed info we have.
---
I wouldn't say its guaranteed to be the next LS episode patch, but it will be before the next fractal is released though. 
---
That would assume the mount will help avoiding combat. 
---
For what we've seen that was no rollerbeetle, it doesn't seem to be much faster than a springer or skimmer or land. 
---
For now we can only guess. For example, what if their HP is rather low, so you'll dismount with 1-2 hits?  
---
What if the rope we saw isn't just for gates, but can be used to rope in enemies that try to escape in the mount?  
---
It was used on an enemy gate, so it is usable on enemy territory. But what if the speed is reduced outside your world's territories?
---
We need more specifics before judging. 
---
People were making wild claims about people gliding into enemy keeps when they added Gliding too, and then they added the Territories that made that impossible. 
---
WvW players want mount skins, that's what they want, whoooo!
---
[Me rn](https://i.imgur.com/eSAfQtR_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium) 
---
Because it's the staple of any pve group. People always show up to the balance threads complaining about Chrono being too good and required for everything. Personally I like that there's a few really important staple roles - makes it easier to set expectations, fill groups for pugging, and to get good synergy right away. 
---
All the people who complain about how off is full of LF Chronos also have the option to make one themselves to learn it and actually accrue experience on the thing they bash on :V though I know several Chrono players who hate the Chrono meta too
---
   Much obliged. Feel free to repost it anywhere, if you so desire. I just don't see how discussing it with other players is going to get anything changes, when it's the developers we have to talk to. Unfortunately, those are more and more elusive these days. Showing up on streams once a week, answering select questions about their beards and sometimes, if we're lucky, about something wvw-related too. 
---
   Here's a template for a reply about a feature X, suggested on the stream, that they use: "Implementing X has definitely crossed our minds and we've discussed X in our meetings. X is something we would love to try out, but right now implementing it requires some *tech* we don't quite have yet. This is however something we'll keep in mind for when we have the resources for it, so it's not off the table just yet!". Last thursdays's stream they've pulled this card on the siege skins suggestion, for example.
---
My one hope is that the silent Anet employees who are definitely out there surveying their customer reactions on mass media, take notice of the fact that active WvW players are quite disconcerted with the lack of resources and transparency that the game mode has been receiving and maybe forward it to those higher up, so that one day we may actually have devs run WvW polls again, talk to players on forums and reddit or maybe even [embed themselves in WvW guilds as they once had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Bd0UWUr6l0)
---
I would love to see the result of the reapers dying  honestly.
---
and the aftercast has been increased to 1 minute
---
It's bad now, but it was legitimately really good for a long, long time. 
---
WVSW OMEGALUL
---
The subreddit can be considered reflective of most of the playerbase
---
Wonder what theyll nerf on thief to make it even more impossible to actually fight anyone. Maybe theyll just reduce damage accross the board to finally force thief to use Shortbow as his only weapon.
---
Time to [ride your charr!](http://thecharmingcharr.tumblr.com/post/136969559742/weirdfolio-nests-and-orochis)
---
I dont really know why they didnt come up with skins earlier, i would love siege skins for example. 
---
Yet Chrono will continue it's 3+ year grip on the meta for as long as it is the only profession that can bring both Quickness and Alacrity. Give Renegade Quickness and Firebrand Alacrity (and tone down their healing / damage when running both boons) and we might start getting somewhere.
---
I'm really worried what it will do to the game mode that everyone will have a portable ram with them.  
---
Golem rushes can already be hard to deal with. Having 50 rams up instantly, that moves at above normal speed seems too good.
---
Article with more info on warclaw https://www.mmogames.com/gamenews/guild-wars-2-wvw-mount-warclaw-announced/
---
I'm all for an instanced PvP arena with 10+ players per team. I wouldn't play it but I think it'd be cool.
---
But that's not WvW. It should take place on its own instanced maps, not in WvW. It seems you agree with me on that, your criticism of the OS and EotM arenas seem like you'd prefer instanced arenas too.
---
So stop asking for it in WvW. It's not what WvW is or should be, and you don't even want it to be in WvW.
---
axe auto buffed by 1%
---
They should take a look into using the mouny skin system to allow some of the siege to be customised. Siege skins sounds like something that could sell
---
Well it is nice to know when it will be.
---
Ive been active with some shorter breaks since release.
---
* i was trying out other professions
---
* i was trying out other races and their starter zhaitan storyline as i lvled up
---
* i was leveling while i was exploring, very rarely i use tomes or scrolls
---
* i do things in a "chronological order"
---
* i play dungeons when im "at that point of the storyline"
---
* occasionally i play a fractal or two, but usually i explore the world, lvl up, do dungeons for tokens /skins/gear
---
* i do living world story
---
* i do annual events like wintersday, haloween, SAB. Enough to go trough all "normal" achievements, and get at least the basic new reward (i stopped going for gold sink rewards such as 312 gold haloween minipet.... or those "upgrade" minipets where you would need 25 small minipets, to get 5 normal minipets that turn into 1 large minipet..)
---
* Every now and then i check the achievement list and go hunt some. Some open world achievements are pretty fun like that mini karka hatchling in lions arch. 
---
* I do daily achievements, all pve ones +big spender wvw daily.
---
* I used to play a ton of wvw back in 2014 during the tournament , then i stopped ,but i picked it up again last year and slowly,weekend by weekend im moving toward a legendary armor
---
* I used to play a lot of wvw back in 2013,rarely troughout the years, but a ton more during the first year of ascention. I actually got my legendary wings in the last few days of the last season in the year and it was amazing.
---
* I still havent decided on which legendary weapon im going for... tho i do have all the resources to make one pretty easy.
---
* I played some raids back in the day when HoT was released, but kinda stopped mid way LWS3
---
* When HoT came out i was kinda juggling between a few characters but only managed to play trough the hot story with 1 character.
---
* During season 3 i had multiple characters for multiple purposes
---
* Since PoF came out i have no main character, I have 1 old character that has beaten all story, another for some farming, for inventory banking, for weekly key farm...etc..
---
* For 2 years or so i kept my self entertained and busy by creating new characters and playing them trough a series of made up challenges. This is my main source of content in the game and its kept me playing ever since. I also sometimes put some of my own background story into the challenge character which usually goes well with the personal story, and the world around it. It makes things more interesting and immersive i guess
---
* Over all the years i played, i managed to acquire all the things, skins, gizmos,items, gear i wanted. Besides a legendary weapon (which i definently wanna craft but dont know which one) i have everything i need and want in the current game.. And on top of that i have enough gold to provide me anything i need if something new shows up. So im just left to play the game for fun without any sort of grinding for mats or gold
---
Why i stopped doing some things is simply because i had found other more fun things for me to do in the game.
---
Usually it will work fine. Support builds will be less effective.
---
You might find that it's worth switching some traits or utilities around for the open world to give you some boon generation (reaper can easily give itself quickness and might) that you don't get without your supports.
---
Is it too much to ask to fix the engine?
---
Agreed.
---
Many episodes were a giant pain in the ass, and I never completed it because the last episode, braham wouldn't make protected bubbles for me.
---
I guess it's better than the "you missed it, and that's too bad" LS1...but only very slightly better.
---
When was that? Been playing since 2015 and blob v blob [v blob] fights in SMC lords has always introduced skill lag. From 2015 until now.
---
Yup, this is exactly what they're implying. It's tied to WvW ranks and will probably require a significantly high rank, in order to limit the amount of mounts all over the map. 
---
They wrote the lore after they came up with the name. Guild Wars 1 intended to have GvG from the beginning, and then they implemented it. GW2 has needed it for awhile. Back when official PvP tourneys were struggling to get more than 500 views, Chemsorly's GvG streams were hitting 2k on twitch (back when 2k was a lot). They may have missed the boat, but it's still sorely needed.
---
Bah, balance patches are the only content I look forward to inbetween excpansions.
---
Nope. Unlike pve land, wvw gets like 1 update a year. 
---
And I'm not even joking. 
---
Except they're not, the burst is high but takes some time to reach unlike DH, it has less cleave and also has a more complex rotation than, let's say, a DD. If DPS chrono ever gets nerfed it'll most likely be because of the boon variant, the DPS variant is not overperforming.
---
I think everyone is expressing fear of change, but that this may make traversal more reasonable for every class. 
---
Teaser is cool, but we definitely need more details about restrictions.
---
Whether or not you can mount outside of a zone of control is a big deal to consider.
---
Earth 4 for staff is the wall. For dagger is a good aoe knockdown around you. Do core tyria map completion with sword and dagger to get a feel for it before HoT and pof as you will be hitting your head on the wall over and over. This will save you alot of stress and time.
---
Nah, I like wvw and play it occasionally, wouldn't want them to abandon it completely. Despite balance, it's a good place for gw2 combat style.
---
Gear is same for reaper. Sigil can also work. Change some traits based on your experience.
---
Youve never played DAoC have you
---
deimos ranged strat. thats all you need to know
---
Then youre lying or dont participate in major fights
---
and who wants to do ranged deimos? :D:D:D
---
Makes sense.  Like how the elite specs are on par with vanilla specs cause they wouldn't want to overtune xpac stuff
---
Dungeons and raids are actually pretty similar in concept. I'll bet the problem with raid upkeep is that they are horribly written. Not that I'm blaming them, everyone gets better at writing things over time. What I mean is that they could likely transplant the raid system into the dungeons for a much easier time upkeeping them.
---
Since the dungeons already exist, programming the instances would ideally not be too difficult, though I admit without being able to see into the system I can't speak with any authority. Though, the map design and mob placement already exists in one form or another.
---
As for "There is nothing left to do".... I don't completely disagree. I have around 3k hours in the game. I've played almost all the content there is, and at this point I'm just spending time grinding for things. WvW and PvP do keep things interesting, but there's no more exploration, no more surprises, no more stumbling upon beautiful scenery or epic scale bosses/areas. It's all the same thing over, and over, and over. LS kinda helps with that for about a week or three, but then it's back to monotony.
---
&gt; I get that this game has issues, a lot, but damn you can't do right by some players. 
---
Personally for me, this comes from seeing most of my guilds empty out or never log in. So many people I used to hang out with have just left, and haven't come back. Yeah I make new in game friends, and join new guilds, but those too empty and poof. Kinda sucks. If I wanted a single player game, I'd play skyrim. But it's hard to play with friends and acquaintances when they keep leaving.
---
This is the final nail in the coffin.
---
I could handle AC damage upgrades, insane wall/gate fortification for towers/keeps, and bullshit like dragon banners, but this is going to completely fuck up WvW combat.
---
I'm pretty fucking bummed rn.
---
What would bring me to WvW?
---
**Better population balance.** I've got my fingers crossed that the guild alliance approach will make it better. 
---
**Less downtime.** If I'm in WvW, I spend most of my time trying to group up with the one or two commanders that are out there. Being more or less required to bring a Swiftness-spam build and maintain it for 2+ minutes just to reach the action is a severe turnoff. 
---
**More incentive to defend or do other objectives.** Every time I've been to WvW, it's been "zerg on tag, mash tower, go to next." They *might* stop for camps. But WvW doesn't split this zerg gameplay up enough, and that's partially due to having no reason to defend territory. 
---
I'm sure that I'm angry about this!
---
Anet been doing it for years and where did it bring us? We went from 7 tiers down to 4 and t4 is basically dead as well. 
---
I remember it being pretty good around summer of 2017 until a bit after PoF launch. 
---
Most  hardcore  wvw-players stopped playing this mode years ago ( \~ 3 years) - people that were very passionate about wvw.. Now that too many casuals get in just for the rewards (not because they like the mode) you will get probably wide range of opinions. Most likely casuals will want better rewards (especially for ppt). For hard-core players the rewards has never been the drive to play the mode. More like good fights,  balanced classes, adequate gvg- arenas...
---
We want updare that improve wvwvw not another sad feature build only to spill  more money with gems ffs
---
We should be expecting a quarterly balance patch soon, hopefully that takes care of some of the issues and shakes the meta up a little. 
---
It is quite possible that the alliances aren't that far off (iirc gliding and legendary armors were introduced roughly 3 months after pips and the backpiece were), but one would expect a World Restructuring Update pt.3 post first. Alliances is something they've already announced, so it makes sense for them to report any major breakthroughs to pacify the restless players.
---
It's not even that, but at least accepting that you won't capture in in your 1st run seem to be a big step already.
---
Also draining supply before commiting big helps a ton, so does splitting. 5 people can't efficiently defend 2-4 spots on a keep.
---
&gt;All the people who complain about how off is full of LF Chronos also have the option to make one themselves to learn it and actually accrue experience on the thing they bash on :V
---
This is the biggest issue honestly. People want to bitch about how Chrono is OP and mandatory but also don't want to learn it. Of course you're going to be sitting in LFG waiting for a while if you're stubborn and don't pick up the class. 
---
&gt;I know several Chrono players who hate the Chrono meta too
---
Chrono main since I started raiding basically, and I'm more than willing to have a shake up in the meta if its actually a good chance. Firebrand/Renegade are just way too clunky in comparison to Chrono and also lack a lot of the utilites like focus pulls, etc. 
---
For reference, I've invested quite a bit into Chrono: https://gw2efficiency.com/c/Rest%20In%20Spears
---
There's a dodge skill that gives some kind of mobility.
---
you should look more often into the lfg ^^"
---
I guess i'm coming back
---
Boi, can't wait to run into a 3 way with everyone on a mount. I wonder if they even did stress tests with it.
---
Lots of people still care about gliding.  And for the record, it does create an imbalance in a game mode that had plenty of imbalance before adding the glider. 
---
Pretty much this. 
---
I feel offense should be much more highly rewarded for taking tiered up objectives. I would make keeps easier to capture too. 
---
PPT needs a rework so those skirmishes where no one plays aren’t worth the same as prime time. Scale it based on number of people playing, and even base it on how outnumbered the servers are during the current time. 
---
The class balance is best I’ve seen in 2 years, but still needs improvements. Little worried mount will be OP with Anet’s balance quality history, but time will tell. 
---
And find a way for balanced match ups and to stop the bandwagoning. 
---
I managed to get it on Saturday, thankfully.
---
Two He-Man memes posted at the same time, what's the odds?
---
It's not worth it.. just PoF and a few gems and the lily of ebon pass which isn't really worth it.. rather get the mistlock sanctuary passkey.
---
The few extras you get don't justify the60€ extra they charge you
---
i know pugs are doing that... but i wouldn't join a ranged deimos... there is nothing worse in raiding than this unfun strat
---
By now I do. :) The way the post is written seems to suggest it.
---
Instead of taking a huge shitstorm in the face? Yeah
---
I dont think gw1 attracts the same type of playerbase as looter shooters...or the even more popular battle royale shooters currently out there. 
---
Its like asking would a remake of the original DotA thrive among the ever so popular minecraft and roblox?
---
Pretty sure the proper attack method is: switch maps with full Zerg, rush to keep and drop 4 catas on the outer wall, drop 4 catas or 4 rams on the inner, rush the boss. Cap in 5 minutes or less
---
Two posted at the same time. Which will win?
---
Can you blame us? Anet has a horrible track record when it comes to WvW. Each change breaking the mode more than fixing it.
---
People complaining about pChrono without realizing that it's one of the harder DPS classes to master, and that it's good in specific scenarios and not the best in slot everywhere.
---
&gt;I was referring to the fact that about 50% of comments on the video are loving the upcoming patch and 50% is hating it.
---
With a sample size of *four*? Sure you are.
---
So what skills do you have in bed mode?
---
there is something much worse: pugging in general
---
i wonder if the battering ram skill will open doors in Domain of Kourna like the beetle does?
---
The fact that you are being upvoted or that a lot of people are actually rejoicing about "removing" an important part of the mode makes me seriously worried about how they are going to implement this
---
If Anet based their decisions on a select few negative feedback, they would have released a new game by now.
---
If you mean the Herald might chant doing quickness instead, yes!
---
Mortal Kombat!!!!!!
---
Cannon blueprints  
---
Better Mastery system that doesn't use World Ability Points  
---
Better rewards  
---
Normal rewards in Edge of the Mists (no one plays it)  
---
High risk/high reward incentive to do the Obsidian Sanctum jumping puzzle
---
&gt;the class is designed for quickness yet totally lacks a way to get it meaningfully
---
Says who?
---
The amount of time you're in WvW for a Gift of Battle is pretty small compared to the amount of time you need to spend to get gliding, and *only* gliding, to a good level. The base version isn't going to do much for you, and you'd be quite lucky to get to Lean Techniques before getting your GoB.  
---
And that's ignoring how absurd it is to state that a strong escape method, which elicits many complaints, of which many are genuine and justified, is acceptable because people making Legendaries don't really want to participate in the PvP aspect.
---
Have you ever heard "oh no, the enemy  inferno hound is in our backline, whatever shall we do" ?
---
I understand that but I also think that spending 3000 hours in a game, even if it is an MMO, is a lot. I have ~4000 hours under my belt and even if GW2 is going down then I'm still glad because I had that much fun in the game to rack up all those hours of playtime.
---
I think my point with this is that some players do need to get back on the ground and drink a cup of reality. Not every game has an unlimited amount of stuff to do and GW2 already provides a fuckton of stuff for the player to do. Some need to come out of their comfort zone as I did with PvP and WvW a few times over the last 6 years. At some point, a player needs to say that they spent a lot of time in the game and that they got their money worth out of it. I sure as hell have.
---
There could actually be a [charr effigy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Charr_Effigy) skin for this. 
---
But I think [GW1's effigy](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Charr_Effigy) looked cooler. 
---
mirage nerf hype
---
Sadly I don't have the time or guild really to get it or I would. But I do have the legendary back pack and weapons along with the mist stuff so it's gotten alot easier sense I have had to re gear my mesmer around 8 times already lol.
---
Your persistence is admirable. Most pvpers have quit but there's still some with faith in anet. Not sure why :/
---
agreed
---
All professions can heal them selves ,and also avoid damage with dodging, or using some other more profession specific ability such as blocking, distortion, or evasion tied to an attack.
---
Gw2 doesnt have the typical structure of party inside dungeons ,fractals or raids, meaning there are no tanks that stand in place spamming aggro and taking all the hits while the dps stab the big monster in the back and the healer heals everyone from far away.
---
That being said, group content ,specifically harder group content does provide roles for players to fill up.
---
All professions can dps if they add a lot of power, precision, ferocity, condition damage and expertise stats, and all professions can become super tanks if they stack toughness, vitality, healing power, concentration stats on their gear.
---
All professions can also support, but the way they support is more specific on their profession.
---
* A thief can support the party with group stealth, skipping large parts of dungeons. They can also blind mobs so they all miss attacks against your party (tho it only works with non bosses).
---
* A mesmer can support the party with a ton of utility, projectile reflection, various boons that decrease skill cooldown and increases attack/skill speed, some group stealth and even opening portals that teleport groups across a large area.
---
* A guardian can support the party with a lot of small packets of healing, shielding them from attacks with a well timed aegis, offering them a ton of boons including protection which reduces damage by 33%, reflects and absorbs projectiles and more. 
---
* A warrior can support players with banners, increasing everyones offensive and defensive stats, shouting that breaks stuns, removes conditions and applies boons, using traits warriors can even share a lot of might boon which drastically improves the dmg (25 stacks =750 power/condition, x5 players =3750 condi/dmg which is like having 1 extra really strong player in your 5man party)
---
Just to name a few.
---
However only a tiny fraction of content requires very specific professions with very specific builds that can perform a very specific role. 
---
Dungeons for example, while thieves stealth is very useful, dungeons are old content which people got powercrept over the years and everyone simply goes full glass cannon and bursts trough bosses and do speed clears.
---
Low Tier fractals are also very similar to that
---
However high thier fractals and even more so raids, do require a dedicated tank, a healer or two, and good dps people who can also support everyone in some sort (most commonly offensive support)
---
Because of this versatility among professions, and a very small % of content actually needing specific builds and roles, you have a game where you can play whatever and however you wish in open world, pure glass cannon in dungeons, and to have a long running meta where the main tank in dungeons arent your typical warriors or "paladin" guardians, but instead light armor mesmer -chronomancers.
---
Guess I'm going to have to avoid /r/Guildwars2  for a while, my doctor told me to limit my salt consumption.
---
Anet is partially at fault for this still. They fostered a community that expects almost zero content updates to their primary game mode. Of COURSE people are going to be resistant to change. They’ve literally been trained to not experience change on a regular basis. 
---
Jesus christ the dislike ratio on the youtube video, I don't understand the hate. Why are these people so salty over getting new things?
---
No, that's a fair point. I have a tendency to forget/disregard the forums. I might be caught up in their old reputation. That's not totally fair of me since I haven't tried engaging in the forums a ton since the revamp.
---
On the flip side, I'm probably not the only one with that problem, so bringing the discussion here might help in some capacity. I dunno.
---
Why not both. Imagine if we were like more popular MMOs where there is actually choice for a particular role. That'd be crazy, wouldn't it? 
---
I doubt glider skins monetized WvW much, tho.
---
Well, at least we got territories and a bit of map tweaking. Better than nothing. 
---
Animal crossing collab next episode
---
So we’ll be able to use only this mount in wvw, but not our others?
---
&gt; We look forward to playing with you and discussing the changes to skills and traits once they’re available next week!
---
&gt; discussing the changes...once they’re available
---
THAT'S NOT "DISCUSSING" 
---
&gt; At some point, a player needs to say that they spent a lot of time in the game and that they got their money worth out of it. I sure as hell have. 
---
I don't take this into consideration, but I've likely poured thousands of dollars into the game. :P 
---
My main problem with the game going down is that it's my goto passtime. It's where I go for lunch breaks at work and such. There's nothing out there at all like GW2, and if it does end up dying... There's nothing to take it's place. I'd likely stop playing MMO's all together and stick with single player or sandbox games (terraria/starbound type stuff)
---
it's not being removed but reworked, it was specifically said on the alliances posts that you'll be able to transfer but servers will be locked for guild members when nearly full.
---
Agreed, another thing I might add is that I fear this may trivialize the significance of WvW strategy. Although the above average movement speed could compensates  for the lack of organization of militia pugs, reducing the already manageable travel time between points could reduce WvW into no more than a mode for zerg fights only. At this point I would have preferred to see a proper GvG system...
---
Yeah but doing PvE events they had *fun*.
---
MMOs and other online-only games are a huge risk because they depend on having an active playerbase. If the game's population dwindles too low then new players are turned off because it's a "dead game".
---
Engage tactical dot.

*We decided to nerf core engineer traits and utilities as we noticed there happened to be some synergies with its elite specializations.*

I really want Celestial, but I don’t have any Ascended gear so still a ways  away from that T.T

Darkness and Glossy Black
---
Anyone else noticing some API softness?
---
I always wanted siege that you actually mount, like a Bofors gun.
---
Imagine building ballista with a seat on the side, you use it to start attack, and you mount it, sitting on the seat. When it turns, your character turns with it. 
---
[Like so.](https://youtu.be/dSp7CipN1pw)
---
Now that's worth gems. 
---
Wouldn't one class having two options for spamming the same boon out be useless? Why not have like two classes instead be able to spam out the boon? Like maybe have Chrono able to give good alacrity and also Renegade?
---
Wait
---
So instead of fixing all those problems you listed, adding mounts which will FURTHER EXACERBATE some of those problems is the answer.
---
&gt; WvW Mounts - obviously
---
I'm going to nitpick this. WvW mounts are not a new product, they're an extension of the existing one. Yes, there will be skins that only fit the Warclaw, but we already have that with other mounts. There will and should be Warclaw skins included in other mount sets.
---
An argument could be made that we're *sort of* seeing monetization ingress towards game balance, but frankly, the writing's been on the wall for "a mount of some kind" in WvW for a long time, well before PoF even introduced them, and that argument has no play because it already exists with glider skins.
---
Frankly there are a lot of lower-hanging fruit that Anet's not opted to go for regarding wvw gem store options, but we're likely to see those replace or augment the transfer system as a way to subsidize Alliances should they ever release.
---
We did level headed feedback, 6 YEARS AGO
---
All hits have now a random chance to hit the player instead of an enemie to instill a new thrilling immersion of gameplay
---
Every male norn in WvW: http://www.actionfigureinsider.com/toy-archive/wp-content/uploads/Mattel/MOTUC/Battlecat/MOTUCBatCatHeM2.jpg
---
The mount also reminds me a lot of the Chinese guardian lions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_guardian_lions
---
Hardcore wvw'ers don't tend to want this stuff, people with a fights focus.
---
People. Can't live with them, can't live without them.
---
Why can't they just add all the mounts to WvW, but give them their own WvW skill bars.
---
Yes mount skins that you don't need to buy I'd understand if the skins gave mounts new abilities but they don't. Also just convert gold to gems and buy the skin that way.
---
It is not that much expensive. Especially if you go for WvW/PvP version for utility , not caring about skins.

World Transfers
---
We understand that even though this system tries to keep guilds and alliances together, there will be times during the season when people want to change teams. Because of this, there are plans to allow transfers between worlds during a season. This means that new worlds will have size restrictions on them, as they do currently.
---
Players will be able to select worlds from the WvW panel in game. Worlds that are available for transfers will show up in the new WvW world panel. Worlds can be in these three different states:
---
For attacking, 95% of the time the defenders won't have a certain spot covered by defenses. Most people throw down their siege, then just leave once they get attacked. Not to mention an organized group can have eles to meteor ACs, and mesmers to pull defenders off walls.
---
For defending: tricky AC placement, defensive trebs, siege disruptors. And you'll need to communicate because if the group attacking is smart you can't hold out forever.
---
alright I was just worried i'd have to tell my groups "yeah hol' up i'm blind for a couple of minutes lmao"
---
Sorta. Necros have a Trait that gives them a pretty big boost to their damage when they're downed. And their downed spam skill is a life drain, which gives them health in accordance to their damage. Downing a Necro is only ~~the beginning~~ part of the battle.
---
&gt; PvE players no longer have to go into WvW for exploration, it'd be nice for WvW players to see something similar.
---
What do you call the gift of battle then? Even doing just WvW dailies means we still have to go in there to get them. 
---
sounds fun, it will make WvW more interesting
---
It's daytime. It's normal for WvW to be dead people are at work.
---
well it's the nail in the coffin for veterans of the game mode that are waiting for positive changes to come.
---
but who knows it might bring in more new casual players than amount of veterans they'll lose / lost already.
---
Though for me personally I have no reason to keep this game installed anymore and logging in just for daily rewards every day hoping for changes that I like to come.
---
In a perfect scenario. What happens is the rewards are tied to server wins, so everyone jumps ship to the top servers and others get abandoned. Right now we have servers that are 4 times larger than others.
---
You are infact wrong. There is GvG discord on EU and i guarantee you that 90% of commanders are in there. At least the ones that use TS.
---
You see GvG players do stuff outside of those 2 hours in the evening 3 times a week.
---
Are there any builds which utilize grieving stats? I have two full sets of heavy grieving armor in my bank from collections and I'm wondering if they're worth keeping.
---
Well apart from that, considering that the video shows one opening a door, I think either there is more information due, OR this mount is like a charr car (rare because of tactivator slots) or a golem - these are powerful and expensive (in terms of supply) siege weapons in their own right. They aren't something that is ubiquitous in WvW and a commander must be prudent with supply in order to create a "golem rush". There are limits on the amount of rams you can place in close proximity to one another - these are staples of WvW. 
---
... but if EVERYBODY can just summon this siege-mount without any supply cost and they can be placed in close proximity to one another (remember, these are groups of well over 50 players), it would be an absolutely massive change to WvW that will make defending extremely difficult.   
---
So I'm expecting something else to be added, too.
---
They've power creeped everything unfortunately. Gear, base specs. Not to mention base professions had balance issues as well. Say bye bye to rangers and engis.
---
Some classes wish they could even get that close to being that good as a power dps, whilst being the top condi dps AND a support lock for every raid battle.
---
That... Is not a common opinion amongst fight oriented guilds and players.
---
Huh. My Charr's name is Waarclaw (Warclaw was taken). So I kinda have to get this for him.
---
Needs more infusions.
---
ahahahahahahahah
---
Staff Weaver is still fun in Fractals, though I'm about to finally give up the ol' girl and learn S/D Weaver. The Tempest Support build uses the staff, too.
---
&gt; There's not really anything to do when a commander isn't around. Some kind of meta event to herd people in the right direction would be nice.
---
There used to be the npc 'commander' thing that would attack the closest tower (maybe also keep, iirc?). Can't remember why (or even when) that got removed.
---
&gt;Better siege balance. Trying to take a T3 keep is nearly impossible. 5 people can defend 50 on T3.Having been on the defending and attacking side with a very small group (less than 5) a lot of time:Most people have no fucking clue how to properly defend a structureMost people have no fucking clue how to properly attack a structure
---
You just ram the door down with 50 siege mounts, right?    
---
Get your screenshots of T3 structures now, because you'll never see them again!
---
I'm guessing it'll be like gliding since they mention the wvw xp boost.  So now instead of having everything at 1060, you'll need 1120 or so to be maxed out on skills.
---
This. This's the ultimate answer to OP. WvW is a sandbox mode allowing multiple playstyles, everyone loves a different thing, and the mode's beauty is in its diversity/flexibility. Sadly, there's also the second face of the coin: this community will NEVER agree on one single thing and it's probably a nightmare for devs.
---
OP is prophetic confirmed.
---
Sure have, and it's not one of those. Besides, why would bags use Boot Uppers or Glove Linings?
---
we were expecting it, a special wvw mount.
---
Yeah, but no one know if it will be integrated well yet.
---
Do you mean the ineffable recipes? If so, I already looked into these, too. It's not them as they require ectos, and the crafting components don't combine with ectos in the discovery tab.
---
Some people who never played wvw will like gamemode while given now a reason (mount) to "finally find time to try it out". Some of them will stay.
---
We aren't really level headed anymore because for many the ship sailed a long time ago. When so many people I know haven't logged in months or years, myself included, and any visits back to the game remind me why I no longer am in an active guild... At this point even if they do try for many I think it's too little, too late.
---
I really hope not anytime soon. GW2 seven years after launch feels a lot more lively and less dated than GW1 did seven years after launch. Story-wise, I don't think we're anywhere close to a time when it would make sense to make that transition.
---
On a selfish note, I've invested way more time and energy into GW2 than I ever did in GW1. Unless they end up doing a far better job at implementing rewards in "GW3" for progress made in GW2 than they did with the Hall of Monuments in GW2, I'd consider that investment to be a waste if they simply "move on" at this point.
---
&gt;Defender's advantage (for upgraded structures) is crazy out of control powerful
---
I don't think that's a problem. In fact, I think this is an obvious example of people misidentifying a problem. Defenders are fine, it's the attackers who need more powerful tools.
---
We should be talking about things like:
---
* Mobile siege, so the attackers can advance slowly against enemy structures. This would force the attackers to defend their siege weapons, while the defenders try to raid and flank them before they arrives. Mobile shield generators would solve many of the current problems.
---
* Persisting structural damage after capture, so you need to repair and fortify each time you capture something. Getting free wooden walls after every capture is terrible, and promotes quick raids instead of long-term strategies.
---
* More NPC support, forcing attackers to bring counters. Bonus points if the claiming guild can customize the NPCs with their own guild's guard settings.
---
Sieges should take longer and be more meaningful, but that's just my opinion.
---
Looking cool is basically the primary purpose of a mount.
---
The one that really long - one time
---
Yes.
---
It's a 6 year old game, if people are clinging to the F2P version or unwilling to pay for content, then there should be a disadvantage imo. Especially when you can still participate in the content effectively.
---
The degree of tuning I'm personally concerned about is related to scale (everybody using mount skills at once etc) but that's yet to be seen.
---
Not a true "black" as it changes based on specific material it is on, but I have grown to love Abyssal Sea and the way it changes between black, blue, and seafoam colors. It doesn't tend to sacrifice texture quality, only darken it. In some cases, it enhances it when the gradient of black-to-blue is shown.
---
I bought it for my Revenant and haven't replaced it since.
---
Shit who knew for years Ive been playing the game wrong
---
No hype. Indeed. 
---
I find the new content boring. I even did not finish the last map. More of the same.  Maps feel unfinished and repetitive. Too much influence from the real life political agenda.  When I started playing GW2 it was magical and heroic, TOGETHER against the EVIL...now is all the same - CNN and alike. 
---
I dream about something like LW S1 - especially Battle for Lion's Arch. One time event, something big and unique, that will bring the players together at a huge scale. 
---
More and more nice people (I met in the game) are quitting. Without them I have no fun doing raids and fractals...and wvw is dead for years.
---
I find the class, stats, food changes most of the time annoying. Just more gold spent for nothing, not a real balance change. 
---
Old players do not get AP for doing daily ...why even bother playing when you can just log in and out. At one point you even do not come back for the daily chest.
---
Even the armors and outfits in the Gem store are mostly ugly. I would love some delicate shoes (all classes) for my female norn,human and sylvari. Also some elegant or girly armor where I can combine different armor pieces together, more sweet dresses for my female asuras...
---
The changes should be discussed before they're implemented, not after, but it's better than nothing, I guess.
---
I love using slightly modified viable raid builds in open world. Currently I'm running around with Condi Quickness Firebrand. I feel like I contribute a lot to meta events while still being solid in solo content. Haven't run into any problems with map completion, champs, or the HoT story.
---
I also enjoy SB3 (Condi Soulbeast with Shortbows) though this is less popular for raiding nowadays. I still think it's good enough, and in open world I go all-in with stances for more boons.
---
...the alternative being that it hardly generates any revenue and WvW goes to live on a farm the next town over.
---
I hope it takes 250 wvw ranks to get mount
---
The article  seems to suggest it can be used in over once unlocked  but I wouldn't be sure until arenanet says anything 
---
Looks like it's pretty much the jackal ability, which makes me wonder why they didn't just add the normal mounts to WvW instead.
---
My friend, this is the whale issue that plagues every game like this. It is the reason we had rng mounts and have rng weapons. It doesn't matter if i choose to vote with my pocket when someone like bill gates can drop money to buy an island. Should he be represented what the game needs? One person.
---
WvW is a game mode that requires people to play it to actually function. Let's say that again: the product that A.Net is selling requires consumers to participate in so that it's actually worth buying.
---
The game is seven years old. It released unfinished and it remains broken.
---
Fuck the idea that consumers are supposed to throw money at the product to fix it. Fix it, then feel free to monetize it. But don't throw around the idea that consumers are responsible for this mess.
---
Mount skins give big profit anyway, anet religiously makes new skins regularly.
---
I just want to be able to play WvW with my guild. I've been trying to transfer servers for over a month but it's always full. 
---
No. The hooved menace must perish. 
---
Well there is no one-size-fit-all strategy for any structure/situation unfortunately but there are a few generic rules that apply to attacking and defending (it's usually pretty obvious which is which), especially when facing a small amount of defenders/big attackers:
---
* You may not cap or open inner on your 1st attempt and that's OK
---
* Surprise works, but sometimes it does not
---
* Supply is key so draining/managing supply and controlling camps is the way
---
* If you are against a small group of defenders coordinated attacks on several spots will have a far greater impact that a concetrated one especially if you play the long game
---
* Think about how you can/want to attack that structure, now think how the ennemy can defend/mitigate it and how you can avoid this
---
* Have a plan of what you wanna do, at least a vague one
---
* Structures have stuff like canons and mortars and they can hit stuff
---
* If you know how to defend a structure you already have a good knowledge of which attack spots are worth it (ie. less likely to have defense already set up) and the other way around
---
* Research, try out stuff when you have time (I have some weird treb spots for the Undercroft that I have never seen used by anybody else and they are extremely powerful)
---
* Treb is love for defense (like for real)
---
* Look at the map, predict the enemy (if you can be already near where the enemy will attack it's a huge advantage)
---
Then it's more specific tricks for each structures. If a 5 people group can wreck havoc on a structure and drain supply even if a 30+ zerg is called to defend (this is called a win if I'm roaming tbh :p) imagine what a little bit of coordination can do for 20+ people (attack with 5 people on 4 different spot and you will open an outer door 100% guaranteed and will wreck their supply).
---
If you see the supply of the structure is not emptying quite as you expected, check out the other big ones nearby: how many times was I attacking a side keep and realised they had emptied their garrison to repair.
---
It's not a definitive list of stuff to do (and I probably lost track of some stuff I wanted to say in the process) but if you only remember 3 things from this is Coordination, Planning and Ressource Management (which is kinda a sort of planning actually).
---
If you thought that introduction of pips and legy backpiece had impossible queues, just wait for Warclaw patch.
---
Here is a list:
---
- Weekly Leaderboards for kill counts, k/d ratio and certain objective captures. (Sentry kills, camp takes for small numbers.) 
---
People need something to take pride in every week. The ranks are increasingly meaningless. Nobody seems them except enemies, which turns ranks into commander sniping tools. On that note.
---
- Make ranks displayable in PVE. How hard can this be to add? 
---
- Real GvG system. Yeah, GvGs have mostly died out but people keep bringing it back trying to get it going. It's still entirely difficult because there is no system for it. 
---
- Alliances. Announced awhile ago, I figured it would take time but it's been a very quiet go of it on news. And once you have alliances done, you can get to..
---
- Meaningful Tiers : There should be a tier for the people who really care about winning. (Blackgate tier lol) And a tier for people who are more interested in battles. And a tier for new and casual players. Each tier can have different rules. PPT tier can have the final 48 hours turn into a comeback mode. Battle tier can have more points per kill. (or even bring back no downed state.)  Casual tier can reset twice as often. (Friday and Tuesday) 
---
- Actual consideration for WvW in balance. More variety of viability. 
---
&gt;The fact that it is unlocked via WvW also means that it will be difficult to have the sort of collection-focused subplot that we got with the Beetle, which makes me wonder how exactly they're going to gate it while maintaining some semblance of balance and progression.
---
It's going to be gated by ranks. Hence why they are doing a weeklong WXP bonus at the same time and saying "to help you get in the saddle faster". Rank 1000 is my guess. Rank 500 is backpiece, Rank 1500 is start of t3 armor, Rank 2000 is glowy chestpiece. The rank 1000 gap needs to be filled with something. And it would limit the amount of mounts since PvErs flooding the maps after the patch will have to grind for months to get there. 
---
Sounds fantastic!
---
This is exactly what I needed, thanks so much for the detailed answer! I'll be sure to give it a shot - that sure makes things much simpler. 
---
This is great news for people like me who enjoyed RvR in Warhammer Online but never took to GW2's WvW because of the super tedious running back and forth across the map on foot.  This has been the missing piece since launch.  Let's just hope it's not horribly difficult to obtain, as that would introduce a massive imbalance.
---
Friendly fire: enabled.
---
Exactly :-D
---
To get more players into WvW
---
Been playing WvW for years. Despite the nay sayers, I'm excited.
---
I can almost imagine some trumpets tooting in the background or something as he leaps forward **TO BATTLLEEEE!**
---
&gt; Frankly I expected them to just copypaste the pve mount models too.
---
That comes later, once the new mount has been "tweaked".
---
Dolyak will be a paid mount skin, I wager.
---
People like to jump the gun, there is no way to know how this will go over as we barely know anything about it.
---
It’s better to at least try the content and then complain constructively.
---
Haters gonna hate but I think it looks dope and fun, and fun is why I play this game and not WoW or other mmos. Can't wait.
---
And people come onto this sub to talk about GW2, not start arguments about philosophical interpretation of fact. Over half the comments you made had nothing to do with the game while I tried to just get you to stay on topic for that. 
---
Gliding was well-implemented, though, with territory restrictions. I can't imagine how they could possibly implement this in a way that doesn't disproportionately favor defenders.
---
Because it will add nothing to the actual mode and in fact has the potential to seriously compromise the mode given the maps are made for movement on foot.
---
I love it!  Don't know the details, but unlike most, I believe Anet does balance *most* things well.  Maybe not the first time around, but they'll get there.  (Realizing also you can never balance some things completely in a way the whole world agrees).
---
I'd guess many other WvWers will be doing nothing but making memes, various insults, and everything possible that is negative about it.  Many whom did the same with gliding and ended up admitting it was done well and a great addition.
---
&gt;Yeah, but when the gameplay comes down to "20 of my 25 people are standing around doing nothing, while the other 5 press 1 over and over" for 3 hours, is that really worth it?
---
I'm not sure to which situation you refer to because nothihng I am thinking about is remotely close to that. The most efficient ways of attacking structures (if the flash attack is not a reasonable strategy) imply coordination and a bit of splitting and not really trebbing siege/walls at max range forever.
---
If I can completely wreck a structure with a 3-5 people group (walls in bad shape, extremely low supply) with less than 5 short attacks then a 25 people group has 0 excuse. Most groups have no vision/plans, they just wing it and pray it works out ok.
---
Just as an example I have seen zergs play smartly around a structure with panicked inexperienced defenders and just by destroying the random siege on the outer wall from outside they made supply drop by half in a T3 keep because people were panic building.
---
&gt;Even defending a T3 keep is boring and unfun.
---
I find defending against a big group of enemy very rewarding and fun tbh. And during down times I usually go experiment with diferent defensive siege (mostly Trebs because Treb is love).
---
&gt;90% of the time the defenders just run away so you're rewarded with hitting a boring PvE lord for 60 seconds.
---
That's not the point of the comment, the comment was to say that people can't take a T3 keep at 50v5. Then if a 50 zerg gets access to the lord and an ally zerg has not come to help I'm not gonna stick around much if we are only 5 to defend because then it's very pointless :p
---
&gt; serious fight guilds 
---
lol
---
The casuals vs veteren argument happens in every game and time and time again shows that companies will pick the short term number increases.
---
I mean, being a new feature doesn't mean it's overtuned. The purpose of it being for PoF players is to make buying that expac more desirable.
---
If the game mode becomes nearly unplayable for F2P players then I'd say it's overtuned. It's still gotta be attractive to play for everybody
---
But yeah I understand what you're saying.
---
YB without siege is like Blobgate without 5 simultaneous zergs.
---
When has a GW2 mount ever been implemented badly though? They've all been pretty dope so far, so why assume this one will be bad?
---
&gt; Overall I just wish they would give us more information about what to expect next week; we know they've been working on an overhaul to how worlds are structured in WvW, but there wasn't any mention of that (as far as I'm aware of, at least) coming out alongside the Warclaw,
---
They said this announcement would not have anything to do with alliances. Based on the last announcement alliances are nowhere near ready and will probably not come until the end of this year.
---
The lighting auto attack chain is your bread and butter while air air 3 is a massive dps to single target. Sometimes using dual elements may not be the best in ideal situations. Fire 4 and 5 should be used for massive burst followed by fire fire 3. Earth and fire are great for aoe cleave aswell because of skills 2 and 4 in both ends of the attunement aswell as skill 3. Also earth 4 and 5 can destroy most mobs that are surrounding you close by as 4 will knock them down and will allow you to channel earth 5 with ease. If you do this combo on a fire field you will get 6 mights for using blast skills in a fire field for more dps. The switch to air and use anything you see fit.
---
Delete stealth and mesmers.
---
Nerf scourges.
---
Change something about how pips are earned. A reward system that makes you annoyed at team mates joining your map is just dumb.
---
I wonder if only one of them can use that rope thing or if everybody can do that at the same time ... or will it cost supply to do it?
---
The "whale issue" is an issue that you cannot resolve by crying rivers of salt water...because your monetary contribution is irrelevant.
---
If your excuse for spending money and still crying is "well, whales are preventing any change anyway", then I don't expect you to understand how you are not helping your own situation.
---
However, if it makes you feel any better whining, then you're always free to do so - just don't expect any results.
---
Why?
---
I think his was sarcasm too
---
They have confirmed on a Tumblr reply that it is usable in PvE but won't have any special useful skill there.
---
Same goes for them, they also have so much to gain by going a lot faster.
---
The gw2 tumblr page commented that you can ride it on pve but won’t be able to use the WvW ability.
---
Gasp. I didn't know the first. Well it's damn powerful indeed.
---
No no no, you are supposed to be angry!
---
How will they balance fall damage around this?
---
Going from vanilla to HoT was “tough as nails” back in those days. Especially as a mesmer! Difficult? Not once you learned the tricks... but compared to the rest of the game at the time? Tough as nails!
---
You STILL can exploit your way into multiple enemy towers and keeps with gliding.
---
The evade ability will likely make you fast enough to make some more exploits possible, and we MIGHT get them fixed before 2023.
---
The return of all the players who have left to revitalize the game mode with the possibility of doing GvG in WVW without Anet staff showing up telling the players they are in fault.
---
At the very least, a "good" change would be having a complete implementation upon the release of that change.
---
Don't release gliders while you can glide into your tower from keep/spawn to defend it. OW was fixed, but NWT/NET/SET/Bay are all viable to glide into. And then how long did it take to make balis into AA?
---
If all of this was done upon release of gliders, it would have been a _better_ implementation. Not perfect.
---
WvW is in the Mists. Literally nothing has to be explained as the Mists can show real or unreal scenarios. Things that may have happened but also things that didn't happen the exact way the Mists show them. The Mists mix the different aspects of reality together in a huge mashpot. Go and listen to some of the ambient dialogue of the NPCs in the desert borderlands for example: "Who built all these keeps and towers? All this was just here?" "Apparently"

Look at this guy tryin to make an informed opinion!
---
I think this would be a huge mistake to gate behind rank. Gliding became so popular because it was available to everyone (who bought HoT). Just one rank point and you could glide. 
---
Shut up dude. Go back to pve and play horsey ride.
---
I play at weekly reset almost every week in big zergs and have never noticed it. Sorry.
---
Yeah, it's a bit heavy-handed but stealth in PvP is just a pet peeve of mine. I've yet to play a game where it's not just super frustrating to play against. Imo stealth mechanics tend to be gimmicky and not really add anything interesting.
---
Grenth is best god!  ❤️

If your other healer is NOT a Druid, water spirit becomes BIS, if not dealing with overwhelming condis. However, xera doesn’t really have condi issues outside of confusion on the tank. 
---
Healing spring / Glyph heal are pretty tied in double druids. It’s really just “is there condi pressure” that tips the scale.

Sends gold to helio on his 5 different accounts.
---
&gt;The other day I entered fractals of the mist on my own and I did half part of one of these just solo. What's the minimal amount of people needed for the easy tier of these dungeon?
---
I'm not giving a concrete answer because T1s are easy enough to do with any group of 5 players. Post on LFG and mention that you're new.
---
&gt;What are in your opinion the most rewarding world bosses? I've been doing cycles daily now, gathering gold mostly but I've started to feel like some world bosses aren't worth my time
---
[Tequatl](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tequatl_the_Sunless), although you're right in that world bosses aren't profitable. If you're *grinding* for gold, Istan and Silverwastes are still the best options.
---
&gt;So it's using master salvage the best choice? I've heard there's an item called copper-fed which doesn't have the capabilities of master salvage kit. Why do people use it if they can't salvage materials at the best rate?
---
Master salvage costs too much per use for too little benefit for blue/green gear.
---
&gt;Do magic find % (the one you increase using luck items) affect in any way the opening of chests (like dragon chest, etc) or it's just for clicking on loot directly?
---
Only when it's [explicitly mentioned](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magic_Find). Otherwise, no. This also applies to loot bags.
---
&gt;It is true that trying to hit in the back of champions it's more effective damage-wise than just tank it as it comes? 
---
There's no special damage bonus for flanking an enemy, but you shouldn't be trying to tank damage either.
---
&gt;Too much influence from the real life political agenda. 
---
Examples?
---
All media is political. Nothing can escape real life influence because nobody exists in a vacuum. You just don't notice the politics that align with the status quo. How exactly is anything more "political" now than it used to be? The messages of inclusiveness have always been there from the start. LGBT characters and strong female characters have been around from the very start, and them existing isn't politics it's just a reflection of reality. I don't see how it's any different now.
---
The reason things aren't as simple as "good vs evil" anymore also isn't necessarily because of politics, it's because that shit is BORING, it's been done to death for centuries, and it's unrealistic. People like morally gray characters and situations because it's relatable and makes you think more. If you just want mindless escapism then a story-focused style of game like an RPG is probably the wrong thing to play. If you want mindless escapism then play call of duty or watch porn or something.
---
Let's be real dude, how many people actually gave a shit about the original personal story involving Zhaitan? How many people were ever moved emotionally by that story in any other time besides your order mentor dying? And even then people only ever seem to care about Tybalt and forget the other two even existed. Nobody gave a shit about Trahearne until we had to kill him in HoT. How many other characters do you remember from the personal story. Nobody paid much mind to the pale reavers until they showed up in HoT either. Meanwhile in the living story people talk about how they cried for Taimi, cried for Aurene, how they were mad at Braham. It actually made people feel something. To contrast, the whole time playing the original personal story I felt pretty much nothing. Because most of it was just military strategizing to kill Zhaitan and not really much else. So if anything I'd say their writing has improved since.
---
Realize you're asking for anet to literally make the story *worse* by removing everything actually interesting about it and just making it another standard good vs evil story with no substance. 
---
Siege rebalance/rework  
---
Class balance/better skill splits  
---
Back-end/Performance optimization  
---
Reward system rework  
---
Alliance rework (i know it's on the way, that's the point)  
---
just anything other than a mount. jesus fucking christ.
---
That's the mounts health, you just get knocked off after that.
---
Why NO ONE waits to see how it will be implemented?? 
---
You will probably mount up only in your territory which makes sense. Wait and see before wishing death upon everyone and start whining.
---
doesn't make it any less true
---
Not measured in years, but rather a reward system which is sustainable for years. Gear “resets” such as those employed by WoW, Rift, etc have been one way of achieving this. 
---
I don’t necessarily advocate for this type of thing, I’m more observing - after playing GW2 since launch - that there feels like a lack of substantial rewards to fight for now. If Anet didn’t have to finance the game through the cash shop, there would be no end to the awesome rewards they could weave into the rewards from the content. As it is now, the majority of cool skins, utility items, outfits, mounts, etc are all for gems.
---
1. Depends on weapon and armour preferences. The ones in Orr offer exotic (the best 'normal' tier gear late in the game. Karma is something you can hoard until you need it so don't worry about trying to spend it all. 
---
2. T1 fractals you can mostly do with 3 people if they known what they're doing, but are designed for 5.
---
3. Teq can drop ascended gear. The leyline anomaly drops mystic coins, I believe. Triple Trouble has a few mastery points attached. A few of them are also part of the collections for legendary weapons, I think. 
---
4. I salvage rares and exotics with the master salvage kit and everything else with the Salvage-o-matic. Fine and masterwork just doesn't really drop anything that worthwhile so people just use the Salvage-o-matic for simplicity. 
---
5. According to the wiki, magic find does not affect chests. 
---
6. Some attacks gain bonuses from flanking (attacking from the back or the side). The description says if they do or not. Most enemies attack forwards, so standing behind is usually a bit safer. 
---
As long as the battle is fun, the more it lasts the better. Right now, siege is a pain, and whoever builds it faster wins. Also, trebuchets inside buildings should only reach buildings of lower levels, not same or higher (no tower to keep, and no keep to castle).
---
The best part of WvW are big battles, and that's what should be promoted. Make players fight each other, instead of sneaking through when the other team is distracted. Capturing a building should give more rewards the higher its tier, and player kills during a siege should give bonus rewards too.
---
And still end up disappointed.
---
Glossy black has been mentioned a couple of times already, so I'll recommend you check out Charred.  
---
It's not a black dye per se but looks like one when applied to certain textures  
---
Weren't those just unused concepts from before PoF release? 
---
This is the [link to the post](http://guildwars2.tumblr.com/post/182917106213/behold-a-mobile-cattering-ram-%E0%B8%85%E1%90%A0%E1%86%BD%E1%90%9F-calling) but their comment is in a reply to a comment (not a reblog) and I have no clue how you can see them outside of the dashboard.
---
The reply (to one of the very first  comments) says
---
&gt;It doesn't have any PvE-specific skills, but you can run around with it outside of WvW! :D
---
Yes, absolutely seems to be the case. 
---
How do you know that?
---
Wow, that's uh, that's all pure vitriol. Calm down, bud
---
Reworked, now summons a meteor which showers in front of the player, towels off and disappears.

Has anyone had success with grieving on rev? Or for any of the hybrid weapons like ranger axe/dagger or warrior sword/sword?

I wouldn't be here if I weren't willing to come back if shit changed.

Are you a furry perchance.
---
Check out the Metabattle website and find one you like the look of. 
---
I'd take that. 
---
They should hire you in the marketing team; have my upvote.
---
&gt;Still I will buy the WvW mount skins, because I want to support the game mode and hope that the profits are used to hire more devs to work on WvW. I also sincerely hope that the unique look and access to special abilities, whatever they may be, attracts more players into the gamemode and that some of them stick around, which is one of the thing we could really use there, fresh blood.
---
I've been having this discussion with my group as of this morning regarding GW2 and other games. Though you're certainly free to spend your money how you wish, I do believe the noble goal you have in mind will not be accomplished. In fact, I'd bet the opposite will be true. 
---
ANet, like almost every other publisher out there these days, is monetizing skins to turn a profit rather than deliver content. There is no connection between the two in any game I play.  By buying a skin it sends the message that skins sell, not content. It gives publishers no reason to push content and every reason to push microtransactions since, as a business, their goal is to turn a profit.
---
I hate that games have come to this. I think it enables laziness on the part of publishers. But we'll still continue to buy because, well, shiny. And they know that.
---

I wouldn't say the world is more racist now than it EVER has been, but there is definitely a resurgence of it in recent years. America and the UK in particular. And Brazil. Brazil just elected an actual fascist who has said gay people should die. He's like Trump on steroids. 
---
Even in real life people are getting more overt about racism, but of course, as you said, on the internet it's a lot easier to say horrid shit without any consequences so you see it more often. 
---
I wish the perception that humanity makes more social progress as time goes on was correct, but alas, it's mostly a myth.
---
1 - I'd like a counter to the endless stealth trolling. You know, any kind of counter really. NPCs need to auto detect stealth in keeps and towers. I've seen permanently stealth thieves contest waypoints for days at a time while ganking people with 0 risks. 
---
2 - You shouldn't be able to use the portals by the doors if you are invulnerable or stealthed. It gets old watching people harass your zerg with 0 risk.  
---
3 - If you pull a tactic at a keep or tower, there should be an emote sent out to the map saying who pulled it and where. This would help identify spies and trolls who are sabotaging to help their realm win. It would be nice if Anet made a few examples out of such people doing this. If that person is on your block list, that person shouldn't be able touch the tactics if your guild claims that site. This would allow servers to ban trolls without needing Anet to do anything. 
---
4 - When someone builds siege, the siege item should also have the name of its creator. This would allow us to identify trolls/spies wasting supply on pointless siege. If that person is on your blocked list, that person shouldn't be able access the supply if your guild controls that site.
---
5 - EotM is dead. Bring it back to life. It needs to give normal Pips and tickets. Add a random raid boss that spawns. Add weird stuff randomly just for fun. Add air ships you can pilot and use to bomb people. 
---
6 - More special events. I miss no down or repair siege hammers.  
---
7 - Outnumbered should also give you a combat bonus. It gets old when you see enemy guild groups build up your spawn tower and camps to tier 3 and chase you down with 10 on 1 ratios. 
---
8 - Blobs make skills pointless. They can't be countered without bigger blobs. 
---
9 - WvW guilds game the server links. PVE population shouldn't have anything to do with WvW population. I get tired of seeing servers get ruined by guilds trying to game their way into easy wins. Look at how JQ was ruined by this. 
---
10 - Get rid of retaliation in WvW. Why does this even exist in a MMO. No really. 
---
11 - Maybe legendary weapons without special skins like they did with armors. 
---
12- I'd like reward tracks with an alternate reward selection like the HoT meta rewards where you can pick the map currency. For example, the dungeon tracks could give you currency instead of the armor or maybe let us trade Gifts of Battle for wvw tickets. Maybe a dedicated wvw reward track just for wvw tickets.  How about one that gives us PvP reward potions for people who hate PvP for the vile cancer it is. 
---
13 - It would be nice if we had a reward track or a means to purchase the Gift of Exploration for people who don't play PVE. Having to constantly do world completion for the 1st gen legendary weapons is a pain given all of the other things you need to do.  
---
istan is still fine, not as good, but fine (they limited the amount of supply stashes you can get after metas to a daily limit, 10 great hall, 30 palawadan)
---
Other than that, pretty much anything you did last still applies. Fractals and silverwastes are also options.
---
aand you're wrong.
---
Ya I’ve heard that really often but I still don’t get it because I feel the need to swap attunements so fast for heals or cc that I never let any of the auto attack chains finish.
---
https://www.mmogames.com/gamenews/guild-wars-2-wvw-mount-warclaw-announced/
---
here you go buddy
---
Finally a class i can main. 
---
Nice Try anet!
---
There was a model of some sort in the files, but it might be just a prototype that never made it any further.
---
WvW was never meant to get rich from. The trickle there was, was mostly just to break even.
---
It was meant as a sandbox pvp mode where people generated dynamic events by just playing the game. A place to mess about, test new things, and watch legends be born (or become one yourself). 
---
Having it too rewarding will just trigger greed, and people will forget the game mode in order to farm whatever they're after, while complaining on reddit how bad WvW seems to be. You say a few more silver, but what about the next one? I can guarantee that someone else will step up and say "those extra silvers are great and all, but could it be *slightly* more?", and before you know it, it all turned into the Silverwastes. 
---
my rotation these days:
---
TD---&gt;AB---&gt;Death Branded Shat---&gt;Teq---&gt;Pala---Great Hall
---
then in the rest of day: both thunderhead peaks metas (north+south), VB, Pinata
---
Why I'm not up on gw2 right now
---
I've made and deleted maybe 6 norn characters, and everyone of them, including my current one, even with the Pringles Man/Braum facial hair options, still looks like the original rendition of God the bible described [https://www.google.com/search?q=extra+crispy+colonel&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwityNjK3MjgAhWtrIMKHRprBVAQ\_AUIDigB&amp;biw=2560&amp;bih=1292#imgrc=JrE\_eHdBzbeiPM:](https://www.google.com/search?q=extra+crispy+colonel&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwityNjK3MjgAhWtrIMKHRprBVAQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=2560&amp;bih=1292#imgrc=JrE_eHdBzbeiPM:)
---
Should we expect PvP exclusive mount as next one?
---
1K dislikes, Anet. Will you learn something with this?
---
Auric Basin, Istan, Dragon Stand, Silverwasters  
---
other are boring imho
---
Istan is still very worth doing after the daily because of the boss bags that you get from almost every champion spawn (which there are a lot of). Obviously it is more profitable with the daily chests but even without those it's still the most profitable overall I believe.
---
Simple design advices:
---
* Solid strokes instead of glow for text; if you are going for strokes and not just plain text, better to use white text with black stroke than black text with white.
---
* More subtleness in backgrounds, less apparent "cheap" 90's effects such as gradients and glows.
---
* More space for eyes to rest - smaller font sizes with larger spacing, more even spacing and better alignment, pictures proportionate to each other and not shoved right between text and frames.
---
The get-up animation at the start and the running animation are the same
---
Criticism of what though? What is there to criticize about the picture? Other than anatomy errors (which, I don't even see any because this pic is actually really good) I have a hard time imagining what kind of criticism they could get about this post that isn't motivated by racism.
---
Nice edit quick there bub.
---
It would be amusing if you could use chain pull on enemy players.
---
I'm concerned roaming will become a thing of the past. I'm concerned about exploits (there are some that have been around for literal years, I won't be surprised if this adds more). I'm concerned about framerates. I'm concerned about server lag and client lag (gliding rubberbanding can get pretty wonky). In concerned that guilds and commanders that accept new players will be at a major disadvantage, because they either can't use a mount without leaving the new players behind. I'm concerned that attackers will be able to take objectives while the response is still loading into the map. I'm concerned that entire maps will crash (it's happened). I'm concerned that a rough release will put new players off WvW and drive more veterans away.
---
I'm not angry. I'm not against this change (yet). But I am very concerned.
---
That people will bitch no matter what anyway and that they should just do whatever gets them the most money? I think they already learned that lesson.
---
Amen.
---
I think your confused friend, I never mentioned anything about ranged dps.  I think your mistaking me for OP. 
---
Geez - the dialogue between the lighthouse keeper and his daughter messed me up every time. Still bitter that the new lighthouse got called Phoenix Roost instead of Graidy’s Lighthouse. 
---
The daughter dropping her “I miss you, bear” at the memorial graveyard just hits me in the feels whenever I hear it. 
---
Gut reactions, providing low-effort feedback rarely say much of what the actual outcome will be with things like this.
---
Trailer shows the mount inside enemy territory after breaking through the gate. So I don't think it will interact with territories like gliding.
---
When person A says that he did thing C and person B says thing C would be better that's not discussion. At most it explanation. It's factum. That's not a way to discuss changes in game after they changed Chrono so many times without any brains in it.
---
Wrong, TD is one of my favorite metas, while Silverwastes continues to be my least enjoyable. Thunderhead peaks introduced a fun meta with the fort (dont feel so much the same with the oil). My personal order is:  
---
* Tangled Depths
---
* Thunderhead Keep
---
* Auric Basin
---
* Dragon Stand
---
* Palawadan
---
* Casino Blitz
---
* Maws of Torment
---
* Verdant Brink
---
* Serpents Ire
---
* Sandstorm!
---
* Silverwastes
---
Thats just my personal order of most to least fun for myself. 
---
Please enlighten me about all the fking content wvw gets, I will wait.
---
What were they supposed to learn exactly
---
oh wow a thousand... I'm sure they are trembling
---
well read the comments under the video. cant say they are wrong.
---
imo mounts and gliders in wvw were a mistake
---
HAH i like  how  norns  always end up looking like somebody no matter the situation 
---
Around 30 fps on lowest settings, in crowded areas less
---
Oh ok I follow you.
---
WoW has the gear treadmill which like it or hate it, has lasted for years as a motivation tool.
---
EQ/EQ2 is raiding.
---
GW2 doesn't have this. In that, I agree with you.
---
They've tried to add in some things like the Sun's Sanctuary or the new dragon weapons but it is limited in scope right now.
---
no way..
---
This meta could be fixed pretty easily by just making the scourge shades only trigger on the shade, so that scourges can't hit 10 targets. That would bring them more in line with other classes.
---
Firebrand is a bit more complex, but it has to do with access to stability, which is basically not a concept in other gamemodes, so it wouldn't be too hard to balance, either.
---
&gt; purrchance
---
FTFY
---
Nor are there roamers, when it comes to roaming.
---
Dismount -&gt; OOC -&gt; Mount -&gt; engage
---
So instead of a fixed timer, you can just run away a small distance so you can jump back into your mount.
---
Can you earn towards it even if you are to poor to get the expansion?
---
Definitely not smoothly. It might run it, but not well.
---
The only thing it says is that there's a lot of overly salty WvW players, who are never happy with anything (don't know what they want), and who jumps to conclusions with a lot of missing information.
---
i agree about waiting.  However, it looks like this mount can attack doors, so it must be able to enter enemy territory.  
---
I guess you are right. Well at least the leap has to be new. And to be honest the animations do seem to fit.
---
The problem with adding too much more sand is the kids don’t have as much fun unless they’re playing together. If WvW had the player population of Fortnite or something it would be easy to see the benefit of adding more sand- but for GW2 WvW you have to be careful to not oversand the box
---
Looks like the joke's on you, 'cause the maze parts of TD aren't even part of the meta.
---
Once you've gotten the Ley-Line Confluence Waypoint, it's just a straight shot to each of the four lanes.
---
The problem the game mode has is that Anet tries to cater to everyone.
---
To fix WvW Anet needs to decide what they wanna do with the gamemode. What is WvW supposed to be. What is the vision the developer had. 
---
THEN after they decided THAT they can start fixing it. Yes some people will be pissed about it. Yes you will drive a certain group of people out of the mode. But dammit how do you wanna fix something when you can't even make your mind up on what's broken?
---
My suggestion: Just flat out repurpose and redesign all maps. Make one map that's designed around roaming. One map that's designed around sieging and one map that's designed around GvG. Then put those maps in a dynamic symbiosis.
---
It's drastic. But WvW needs something drastic. It's a house that's build on a rotten fundament. You fix the roof all you want, water will get inside from the ground.
---
Wvw has its own mastery system based on ranks not mastery points.
---
My favourite is the condi quickbrand but everything you said pretty much the same.
---
can confirm super gay
---
That's a U series processor, likely means that it doesn't have the ability to plug in a GPU unless it has thunderbolt.
---
Honestly? I've tried to enjoy it but knowing that where I want to be is a ten minute jog away along dementedly uneven terrain is a reason I don't bother. 
---
I like PvE. I like PvP. WvW feels like a hiking simulator. 
---
Give it a shot. You can try it for free. 
---
Welp, time to werfer some flammen with my flammenwerfer.
---
You know, I hadnt even discovered all of the map before I first did the meta, so maybe I'm a bit biased against it. I'll try it out now that I;ve actually uncovered the whole map.
---
I figured this was a laptop and that he was looking at buying it (can see the edges of the laptop and another laptop back to back with it). Figured an entirely new rig (diff processor/gpu) is in order.
---
On second look i see a pricetag in the background. You are likely correct.
---
Lets be real. Wvw will not benefit one bit from any monetization. Any extra funds will be used for pve. This has been the case for 6 years. Will remain to be case until the game dies.
---
But- im pretty sure looking bad was intended
---
Because I like the mount and wvw haha
---
Kitty mount from Hallowe'en... Maybe the head gets a big strange at night, but overall it is a beautiful flying kitty.
---
but it has some hilarious arguments there tho, 1 mirage main was literally arguing that mirage is balanced because he can beat a mirage on his mirage, he was actually serious xD
---
They hinting that they will ressurect Aurene in the next episode, which i never doubted.
---
I don't know the meta and mechanics well enough to be more specific, but I recently got so tired of fighting mirages that I made one. I then went on to win my next 8 games in a row while barely knowing how to play the class. You can dodge forever, burst people down, flood them with conditions, teleport all over the place, and force your opponent to lose targeting on you at the same time. If they manage to tank all that, you can still teleport around or stealth until your cooldowns come back. It is literally the easiest time I've ever had in sPvP and it feels really unfair to play. 
---
They are literally giving WvW content out *next week* and it has been met with a howling vortex of furious rage based on a 40-second video and three paragraphs. 
---
Yes, WvW has less than PvP and PvP has less than PvE, but they have clearly recognised this and are trying to add to it. 
---
Just want my spellbreaker to fun again before you nerfed his damage.
---
I would say it's a mix between the griffon and the jackal.
---
I wonder why they didn't just enable the normal mounts, or made a dolyak mount instead.
---
If you like WvW you should realise mounts are quite likely to compromise it for the worst.
---
The people who ran in that meme run are exp. We asked for 100ess but been waiting for awhile and noone joined, so we lfg 50ess. we just told them to wait at checkpoints so i could go over mechanics. As my friend said just go with it and had fun, there's no need tp prepare or anything so we just rolled in. 
---
I did exactly what i was asked for and had fun doing it with people. The mother of 2 could watch it and learn all the mechanics and know what happens when it fails. That a pug i met in t4s started to run in CMs now and a PTSD friend too. 
---
I'm not half ass, but I've had people watch stream live that many. So my DMs were exploding. And i only typed in quick im streaming or cming just like the one i replied in whisper and that's about it. Was super distracted and failed all mechanics which is bad. But that's the point of teaching, learn from failures. All those people watched perfectly executed vids and not knowing what's going on. They're different and so our method of teaching. I already said that gameplay was trash and people were still salty. Last week ran CMs and we failed at arkk twice. 100ess group. I was on a dps, not even druid. Do you really think I'd last in a  high kp party without getting kicked in the first minute with this trash gameplay and shitty camping? Some people on stream have well over a few stacks of ess and they weren't even talking salt cuz it's a meme, plus different method of teaching. It is what it is. I have nothing else to say. I'm not fucking half ass. Tyvm. Have a nice day. 
---
* Nerf some of the strong things
---
* Buff some of the weak things
---
* Provide some token, but ultimately meaningless buffs to weak things that won't make them desirable just to make sure there are more buffs than nerfs in the notes.
---
Please just stay in PVE...
---
Something that gets rid of illusions.
---
Lol, are you serious. WvW guilds don't recruit on reddit...
---
It is not a lot of back and forth at all. Not if you are a part of the comunity and comunicate with your server, other servers, discord, TS and every were else. We all want the same basics. And then there are some difference about the cherry on top. The basics needs and wants are always the same. 
---
I’m fully onboard the mainhand shield Guardian train! 
---
Towards what? Nendoroid face cases and Figma museum series?
---
I agree that sometimes it's annoying to get the right mouseover when things are cluttered, but I don't have anymore keybinds left, lol.
---
Obviously proper balance and worthwhile rewards are in extremely high demand.  However, when attempting to view this from the side of a developer, it becomes less obvious what is wanted.
---
When compared to PvE especially, the differences are insane. PvE players want new maps, new story, likeable characters. They want things to be developed for them.
---
WvW, on the other hand, has generally disliked "new" additions. Desert Borderlands blew up horribly. The game mode is leaking players but any attempt to add something new just causes more frustration.
---
It's almost like ANet only likes to solve problems by developing something for it. Balance and things that last aren't exactly their forte.  At least, that's how it feels. New is always better to them.
---
And that does kind of surprise me, do WvW players not want new content? But as I've discussed with people here, I realize that the playground is already set. Players just want ANet to keep things from getting out of hand so things remain fun and people stick around to play.
---
And I think that comes across as an extremely abstract idea to them. The distinct *absense* of what they think is important.
---
Something for warrior that lets it be medium ranged. Dual pistol hype?
---
did you read? i make it easier since you didn't understand apparently:  
---
why take away from the chrono (while it was fine and fun to play) instead of giving more power to other classes to make them as good...(so chrono is not mandatory)?
---
i see you double-down on it, that's nice
---
how are the people "exp" if this was a teaching run? you make no sense..were they 50kp or not? or are you saying you were teaching 50kp people what to do?
---
just because you said the gameplay was trash doesn't magically make it un-trash
---
also yes indeed it's quite a different method of teaching and i bet it's effective! doing wrong things and telling people they are wrong is very educational
---
we should do a training run together since there are some things that you forgot to "teach": jumping off the map, unplugging the computer and punching the screen
---
how will people know NOT to do those things otherwise? hmm
---
The best way to find a wvw guild is to join your server and either ask in chat or look for guilds who is advertising in chat INSIDE of WvW.
---
Also exagerates? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrjjayEhNYw&amp;t=0s Look at the dislikes, they are more then the likes, it never happend before in the GW2 history.
---
let's say the chain snaps at the breaking point and the gate rebounds 
---
Guild wars 2 balance patches generally feel bad. They don't end up fixing anything... just changing the flavor of classes, their gear, and their rotations for seemingly no real reason. Perhaps they just want to nerf all the elites slowly until new elites replace them. That would be total bull crap... but I'm not really sure what other reasons they have for introducing this horrible gear / rotation grind on us every 2-3 months. What other motive do they have?
---
Person posts art of black person in celebration of black history month, with no argument or aggression, just a picture.
---
Then YOU decide to bitch about black history month...
---
and somehow THEY'RE the ones shoving an agenda down everyone's throats?
---
You clearly have an agenda and you're clearly the one shoving it down someone else's throat.
---
&gt; why do you want to make chrono even more shit then it is right now?
---
Because it's fundamentally broken to the point it needs to be reworked entirely. When it's THIS BAD and still MANDATORY it's a huge balance problem. Power creep is not always the answer. 
---
I see this kind of thing come up anytime someone tries to raise discussion and awareness on how to improve the game.
---
Like, sure, it's usually a joke, but still. Why are we acting like we don't want ANet to know what we want?
---
Dislike the warclaw seems to be more hyped
---
but can it fly :(
---
I do wish they would at least do a monthly balance update, it doesn't have to be large every time. But having a few changes helps.
---
&gt; And people come onto this sub to talk about GW2
---
Yep they do, I do, we all do... but not you. *You* pretend a fact based discussion only to troll and insult other users. 
---
Great things you doing here, very special.
---
The only good thing that comes out of this is that we can get to ride a cat
---
It's okay man. When I raid with you I pick them up, drop them right away without using, and still outdps you
---
Saying "happy black history month" is so innocuous and inoffensive, and here you come with aggressive bitching about it thinking it's the same thing, lmfao. You're clearly way more invested in pushing an agenda than anyone else here.
---
The tyranny of distance is a key balance feature of any RvR mode so this is not a valid reason for mounts
---
If its instakicked from raids, it needs a buff
---
I wish this would be implemented, I have fun roaming with my friends, but having small objectives like that would be awesome and hopefully would give us some nice fights 
---
You forgot to mention you lost all Ferocity, too. It's nowhere near close to Berserker stats.
---
Companies pick profit. They don't care about your service time, they do what costs the least and will generate the most. 
---
Any "veteran" knows mounts were inevitable, the only question is what level of impact they will have.
---
Just because you want a different, or more meaningful change doesn't make this a nail in the coffin (at all).
---
It might be 1 per door, but even then it's like having a charr car on every gate 24/7.... and makes Charr Car redundant, I guess.
---
One thing and it's disgusting.
---
o__o
---
The content keeps customers around. They're not stupid, they get this.
---
This is just what baffles me so much, since we spoke out over a period of 6 years exactly what we want and in the end we never really got any of it. All those things that would attract people to the game mode, new players, players who stay because hey there is a leader board and my guild is on it and i want to fight for them. 
---
But A-Net are so disconnected from us. It is like we are two islands and the thing we want never happen and this amazing game mode that no other game up to now manage to make just as good is being killed. 
---
They could earn tons of money on it. Siege skins, npc skins, keep/tower skins, WvW related outfits, WvW related anything. But instead they keep on trying to add PvE to WvW to get people to come and grind for a month and then WvW is empty again. Because they wont stay. 
---
Anyway i am blabbering away. I am tired and sad and angry and got a headache and for the first time ever in over 6 years the thought of quitting the game entered my head. And that made me upset. Ofc i will be here and see how this plays out but i am tired....
---
I have everything that is possible, it's still a pain in the ass.  Anet is taking several years to make a single legendary ring :cry:
---
Aren't mounts already enabled in wvw areas you own?
---
What is changing?
---
Anyways Zerker gears never went wrong
---
That's true. In game better
---
&gt;You know why people hate Chrono and no one goes to learn to play Chrono? People don't like it. It's not fun to play and nothing they ever do to change chrono will make those people want to play it. It doesn't matter how fucking mandatory something is if people don't find it fun they won't play it.
---
You can thank the nerfs for this bit.  I mean, I can't speak for anyone else, but personally I found Chrono a lot more fun back when minor signet of inspiration was a thing, to the point where it was my favorite class (holomancer and mirage tied for 2nd).  Sure, the rotation was technically more complex than the mimic one, but at least for me I found that rotation to be so natural to the point where I was slowly picking it up overtime, simply because I was focusing on increasing my boon durations. Now, I'm not sure if I would have ever reached the meta-rotation by myself, but the point anyway is that it felt very natural, and so I found myself gradually moving in that direction without intending to.
---
I can't comment on the new rotation though, I quit playing during the mimic meta (which was atrocious imo) and occasionally drop back in to see what doom and gloom the balance patch brings to my chronomancer.
---
&gt;Chrono is a fucking joke of a spec that never should have existed because they took one SINGLE elite spec of a SINGLE profession and made it mandatory. They didn't make a role mandatory they made a SPECIFIC build of a single class mandatory. 
---
If I remember correctly, this is because anet designed Chrono to fill the roles in raids that no one else could.  So in a sense, anet *did* create a mandatory role, and that was the "hole filler".  Why spend the effort creating a bunch of different elite specs to fill a bunch of roles going unfulfilled, especially when supports seem less popular than DPS/tank (if you need 2 supports to fill the hole left by a single Chrono, now you need twice as many people willing to support)?  If you make a single role that does it all, you'll have complaints of it being op, if you have two roles that have to be played together, you'll have complaints about having two mandatory classes instead of one.  It worked too, Chrono basically filled the roles so well that they can't get it out of the meta.  They created a patch and now people demand they rip it off, but if anet did that, it'd drive home the fact that they haven't spent all that much effort actually trying to fill the holes Chrono patches up (because it's not anywhere near as easy to do people think it is, so while it frustrates me to see Chrono get nerfed, I don't totally blame them for taking the easy path in this case).
---
i have like 2 pairs, and 50 individual socks, i just pair the closest one in color
---
Pour one out for the original Foot in the Grave.
---
Indeed, but there is such a thing as too much distance, and a total lack of joy traversing said distance.  
---
&gt; isn't motivated by racism. 
---
If saying something as inoffensive as "happy black history month" is enough to make you so angry that you feel the need to PM the person to argue about it when the OP wasn't even trying to have any sort of political debate, you might just perhaps be a littttle more racist than you realize.
---
Criticism isn't always warranted or appropriate, not everyone has to be open to a debate 24/7 just because they mention something that you don't agree with.
---
that fixes armor, weapons, backpack, and accessory.  Still need to take care of amulet, accessory 2, both rings. Not saying its not better, but even with all legendarily items in the game, your not fully covered.  
---
Then a wintersday present skin
---
Racism exists from many sides. Also do you really think old ladies dont clutch their purses at some white guy with messy hair and rugged clothing.  
---
Also they won’t clutch their purses at a well groomed and dresses black man. But they will at a white or black person with a cap, basketball shirt and pants down to his knees.  
---
It’s really not so much about race as it is about class and the way you behave and dress.  
---
I've always thought a lot of GW2 balance issues are actually the result of design issues. The only way to fix a design issue is to redesign the problem item. 
---
There's a balance patch next week so we cant be sure what's gonna perform well. Pick something that looks fun, check some youtube videos of their elite spec gameplay.
---
yhea , it worked great for pve.... soo many improvement after mounts skin came out....
---
&gt; just convert gold to gems and buy the skin that way.
---
Where do you think those gems are coming from?
---
Once there was this guy in Mistlock S. that asked for help selling an Permanent Bank Access and I called him out that its propably fake and that he wants to scam people, by asking for money. 
---
He said its not fake and I responded with "well spam it in chat then", he didnt know how tough so I told him.
---
He fucked up though and opened it instead of posting it in chat and immediately panicked. I told him to calm down and write an support ticket. Also I felt really bad about it and send him the 100g he was asking for in chat. 
---
I completely forgot about it after like 2 days, when I received a mail with 200g and a Thank you very much letter explaining that he never experienced such a good support team. 
---
(Sorry for bad English)
---
Gliding, yes.  Mounts, no.
---
And the 20 people sitting in SMC repairing a trebbed wall?
---
You can use gliders on your territory. Mounts can't be used in WvW.
---
Great idea!  Let's get one for Build also.
---
im pretty sure the exactly same shit was repeated over and over when Path of Fire announced mounts, look where we are now
---
You can, yes.  You won't be able to use the elite specializations available in the expansions, but you can play with all core classes, and there are some competitive builds you can use.
---
Listen, as you all seem to not understand; It's not about rejecting changes, it's about the changes being completely out of touch with what WvW is, OVER AND OVER again. This is just another one with massive impact that does not help the gamemode. It only makes it look more fun to players who aren't engaged in it's community and will not come back after the initial boost of interest for the new shiny.
---
This whole blaming the players for criticizing changes that are cleary problematic is so awfully biased too. If Anet announced friendly fire in open world PVE, how do you think the players would react? They would be angry about it before seeing it too because they would know it would massively negatively impact their gameplay. It's not about WvW players. Same thing when people say wvw/pvp players are toxic but I see just as much vitriol (for even much more dumber reasons if you ask me) when you burn the octovine too quickly in open world or fail any meta event.
---
This is not exclusive to competitive players and people ought to know at this point that the players of WvW do know the game mode better than Anet...
---
Agreed, been playing WvW since I started back in 2012-13, people need to calm down. WvW has to evolve with the game/expansions, we can't bring out the pitchforks everytime Anet tries to add new stuff to WvW. I for one am glad that they are implementing mounts, it's just natural next step in the evolution of WvW. 
---
No, they're gonna find an even more asspully way to do that.
---
If you are not 80 there may be a level restriction, I’m not sure ...but not having the expansions will not lock you out from pvp as that is considered part of the base game. 
---
True, asking inside WvW is way better than reddit. 
---
And yea, WvW dying is an exaggeration. People are complaining  because everybody knew mounts were coming but they wanted something else (alliances, guild vs guild).
---
It's disingenuous to say it's dead or dying based on that. The lack of info or updates on alliances is a bigger concern.
---
Something on ele that doesnt have heavy efficiency/cooldown sacrifice. I'd rather have a bit more functional mechanic than shiny effect that requires 5 traits or skills to be utilized.
---
Dhuum really fucking hates necromancy and ressurection. If anything he'd try to stop us if we tried.
---
Thing is though people designing mounts aren’t the same people who design balance and stuff. This mount isn’t taking away from what little balance WvW already gets, and if Anet does it right, it could solve some issues like overpowered defences.
---
Normal abyss
---
Bunker mirage becomes bunker chrono's cousin.
---
Dual-wielding shields!
---
I think it's fair that people want new shit that doesn't suck. Not just new for the sake of new.
---
??? I didn’t PM anyone nor did I say sending people angry messages is right. You are projecting something on me which I’m not.  
---
I just said that usually people respond to these things with some arguing, but not angrily or whatever. And I already said that if they did that’s a bad thing.  
---
But I guess you’re really that desperate to call someone racist.
---
It's just incredible annoying and frustrating to play against a good mirage. I play quite a bit of it myself (I kinda suck though) and once you get good at managing your mirage cloaks, you can basically never die in-between heals and a million different teleports. On top of that, staff ambush + clones w/ infinite horizon spawning every few seconds makes life seriously painful. Conditions upon conditions plus clones everywhere and quick recharging evades and 4 shatters (distortion, damage, confusion) and invisibility (torch 4, also is a trait) and *multiple* teleports (blink, staff 2, shadow-step, axe 3, jaunt, etc.) makes it so annoying to kill. There they are- no wait, that's a clone, there's the rea- aaaaand you're dead. Stupidly fun to play though, not gonna lie. Saw another post by a user with their WvW mirage build, said they got a lot of salty pms lol
---
&gt; all I'm seeing is that no matter what Anet did they were in a situation of Damned if they do and Damned if they don't.
---
This is just not correct, WvW players have never asked for mounts except for some casual players. This is just anet introducing another mount they can monetise, its just another shiny to obtain rather than fundamental fixes and changes.
---
Can you get this without PoF? 
---
&gt; modern fantasy lit
---
What do you mean by "lit"?
---
&gt; In Draconis Mons we learned that killing an elder dragon would release enough energy to probably make Tyria explode. But if we kill Kralk in the underworld his magic wouldn't (possibly) reach Tyria.
---
tbh that would be a massive asspull and dissapointing payoff for a storyline that's been going on for years.
---
The stakes have been raised so high I doubt there can even be a proper payoff that's not an asspull.
---
Is that what's changing? Mounts on your territory will now be enabled?
---
just cause I want to have sex doesn't mean I want a fist jammed up my ass
---
Rank 1000 takes a long while I doubt it will be that high if they gate it behind ranks at all. They want PvE players to get the mount as well cause MOAR skins.
---
&gt; just changing the flavor of classes, their gear, and their rotations
---
as thief player i await a changeup of the profession
---
I'm glad actually. It let me play power scourge in wvw as part of the meta.
---
Yes Daddy, spank my chrono and nerf my boonshare again!
---
I want to regear so badly!
---
^^^FYI: ^^^I've ^^^just ^^^accepted ^^^that ^^^I ^^^am ^^^in ^^^an ^^^abusive ^^^relationship ^^^with ^^^chrono ^^^changes.
---
I want char to stand up again. Upright flame legion was badass.
---
So the answer to lack of build diversity within a certain class is to nerf Mesmer?
---
I don't get that logic. Yes, Mesmer is a great and diverse class, all classes should be aimed to have such diversity and such utility.
---
Way to miss the point. How exactly would you personally describe a new good MMO.  You realize that virtually anything you put in an MMO some other group will say it's not good. Right now MMOs come in different shapes and sizes. There are sandbox MMOs, there are themepark MMOs.  Guild Wars 2 is an sandboxy themepark, but at the end of the day it's still a themepark.
---
There are MMOs where you're forced to open world PvP, like Archage and BDO. There are MMOs that focus on end game instanced content. 
---
Some people would never pay a subscription. Some people think free to play is always going to interfere. No matter how you fund your MMO or how you design it, no matter what you do, you're putting an investment into a shrinking ever more divided player base. I'm pretty sure most people don't make MMOs because the risk vs reward is too high. People in game want to talk about getting more reward for taking more risk. Pretty sure investors would want that too.
---
WvW is meant to be a competitive mode hardly the same as PvE maps.
---
Well, only the new mount will be available in WvW. However, as far as I understand, you will be able to use it anywhere as long as you are not in combat and have enough space to mount up.
---
Anet can change a lot of things but they still can't buff player intelligence, the tech isn't there yet.
---
Will the mount be useable in normal pve too, sans the skills, or only in WvW?
---
Alpine BL is actually small for RvR distance.
---
&gt; Racism exists from many sides. Also do you really think old ladies dont  clutch their purses at some white guy with messy hair and rugged  clothing. 
---
The key being that "messy hair and rugged clothing" is the reason and not that he's white. How you fail to understand this is frankly baffling. That isn't racism. Rugged hair and clothes aren't a race. 
---
&gt; Also they won’t clutch their purses at a well groomed and dresses black man 
---
LOL YES THEY DO. Maybe not always a guy who's in a suit but a black guy who's just in normal-ass clothes? They absolutely do. Come to New York sometime and I'll take you for a ride on the subway and you can see for yourself.
---
&gt;It’s really not so much about race as it is about class and the way you behave and dress.
---
Racism exists whether you want to believe it or not. Sorry bud.
---
Not for too much longer probably
---
I just wanna know can I ride on it outside of WvW?
---
The closest I have to a main is my power-based DPS Chrono that I would love to have an elite spec focused on power DPS for. I could see mace or hammer as potential weapon choices specifically because I want something other than the current mainhand sword. If push came to shove, I'd also be up for longbow as a replacement for greatsword.
---
Not the only profession I'd like to see get a power-based DPS elite spec, hello Ranger and Revenant.
---
As I understand it the mount will be able to be used on PvE maps just without the WvW abilities.
---
sPvP needs level 2 or 3 to join, so is pretty fast to unlock. WvW needs level 60 and to be on same world.
---
If you're running with a zerg, or just other players, people will usually drop some swiftness. And the maps SEEM bigger than they actually are.
---
How are other mounts explained lore wise? And yes I have them all.
---
Where was this information revealed? About the new mount and WvW?
---
If they took the keep, they get rewarded with an advantage. The solution is to not let them get the keep.
---
Am I the only one thrilled by the Warclaw addition? 
---
are there any elite specializations in the base game or do i just have a disadvantage because i dont own the expansions?
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/tame-the-warclaw/
---
Greatsword Revenant, it would be so satisfying to zoop around hitting enemies. Maybe channeling Jora?
---
Or Possibly Long/shortbow channeling Pyre, both would be cool.
---
They could have made a dolly mount were you can transport more supplies if you ride it. It will move slower but have more supplies and you get to play around this which add more game play to defenders or roamers which would be a good thing. 
---
They could also sell siege skins, npc, skins, keep/tower skins, WvW outfits, WvW tonics, WvW glider not to mention the already high costs for swapping servers. But insteade they made a mount with 3 engage skills. Were one is on engage with enemies. Which will cause server lag in zergs, enemies that runs off, players who do not own PoF will be ganked and never being able to follow a comander so we always have anything from 1-20 players or more falling behind. And on EB and Alpine where the maps are much smaller it will take roughly 30 sec to run back and death will never matter. 
---
Why do we have to deal with this when Anet could gain money from other things in the gemstore?
---
&gt; Well, I'm not saying players don't know what they really need, but I think Anet has a bigger image about what they think is necessary and what is not.
---
1-2 anet developers know what players want, the anet leadership don't and disregard all WvW feedback.
---
Not fully covered, but accessories are the easiest to get from that whole set. If we actually don't forget to tak mist accessories that you can reset for minor cost.
---
The idea is to be as versatile as possible, and *forever*. Even switching those runes is then easy/cheap as you don't need to destroy them. It has big value if you really care about having top top build when meta changes.
---
That pull chain thing that it has is so unfair imo. If they update the glider to be able to snipe people or drop traps from (like in DS meta), the warclaw having an interaction beyond movement speed is too uneven when pertaining to the contributions of the expansions to WvW
---
. 
---
 is anyone really surprised
---
ITT/subreddit: casual/non WvWers that don't get why WvW is/has been bad.
---
or gliding just forced more people to quit.
---
I died laughing 
---
Oh neat. It's great that WvW is getting a proper content update.
---
Shame that means episode 6 will be even drier than usual for PvE though.
---
Grave dye!
---
Very good at showing textures and has a more washed out black look to it.
---
Have you ever explained to wvw noobs why this isn't the right thing to do? Most of those people think they are helping..
---
&gt; Just because you want a different, or more meaningful change doesn't make this a nail in the coffin (at all).
---
yeah thats what I said?
---
WvW had a lot of players an anet pissed it away due to neglect and total failure to understand the mode. This is a short term fix and playes will leave once they have their shiny
---
So.... Can I unlock this then take it to PvE? I don't WvW.  
---
Also WvW should only be sPvP Amulets and balance. lol
---
&gt; WvW makes money --&gt; more support for WvW.!
---
hahahahahahahaha you forgot the /s
---
If they can be used in PvE why would they go to WvW to show off the skins?
---
Can we also add WvW to it? I think it would help rebuild a dying part of the game. By bringing more people into the field which in turn would lead to high demands on materials for crafting armor and weapons which you can get from the TP or from doing your rewards system. 
---
Again, you used the word “you” and it happened once. And yes I am going to get defensive if you’re going to claim “white privilege” is a thing.  
---
Again this discussion is pointless, goodbye.
---
Ah didn't know that
---
WvW is dying
---
Limit squad size to 25, problem solved ^(this is a joke)
---
I'm positive it is.
---
Well most of them have been established as being native to Elona. The jackal was made from the Margonite runes by Djinn. The Beetle was mutated from a Scarab (which is weird considering Roller Beetles existed already in lore). They all have some sort of explanation.
---
I wonder how anet figured out maybe the one thing that's least needed in wvw.
---
&gt;You think it’s surprising for me to think you’re talking about me when you’re literally saying “you”. 
---
Yes because I assumed you would understand that not everything in English is literal and are smart enough to at least consider that possibility instead of immediately taking it personally. 
---
Maybe it's just an American thing but people do it all the time online and off. And literally no one I've ever met has ever used "one" outside of a fantasy film.
---
The vocal minority always dominates, I literally only played wvw for years and liked the change overall but as you said it was horribly exploited as I’m sure this will be.  
---
Either way, I doubt this will bring many people back who have abandoned the game entirely 
---
It's a teaser trailer, details will probably come later, as usual. Chill.
---
If you think they will allocate more resources to WvW based on selling this mount skin I've got a bridge to sell you.
---
Isnt it obvious? :D
---
Literature.
---
So it can hit 16k coalescence of ruin instead of 8k? no thanks
---
I wait in trepidation for every balance patch and ask myself "Alright, how many of my ascended sets do I have to throw down the shitter today?" ... And then there are the 8 new fucking rotations and playstyles you have to learn after grinding the gear, of course. And for what?
---
... TO DO LESS DAMAGE THAN 2-3 MONTHS AGO AND HAVE A MORE ANNOYING ROTATION,  that's what! Feelsgreatman
---
“Someone” is also an option. When you’re talking about something as sensitive as racism, using the word “you” to refer to people in general isn’t the best approach you know.  
---
If I told you right now that: “Well maybe when you think white privilege is real don’t you think that you’d be a little bit racist?”  
---
I’m pretty sure you’d take that personally. Not sure why you were surprised and instantly latched out at me.
---
Shortbow engineer. Instead of your typical arrows you shoot alchemical injections to harm enemies in a variety of ways and perhaps buff your allies.
---
There are normal specializations, which you'll be able to use three of.  The expansions offer an elite specialization for each class, which offer new weapons to equip and tend to have stronger effects than normal/core specializations, you can equip one in your third specialization slot if you have the required expansion.  With some classes, the lack of elite specialization will put you at a disadvantage, but as I said there are some competitive options you can field with just the base game options.
---
 - Aug price adjusted to $3150
---
I've been playing since launch but since I'm a filthy casual I only have one character with full ascended...but even still, I find myself in the same boat as you.  There isn't much incentive to me to craft more ascended since I don't raid and frankly barely notice a difference in effectiveness between my full exotic characters and my full ascended character.  IIRC the stat difference is 5%....considering how long it takes to craft relative to that, I really just treat it as a side project.  
---
I've started a few legendaries but I haven't even finished my first precursor cuz of the grind.  It's a shame they chose to monetize mount skins because I love the mounts and what a fantastic opportunity to create some cool rewards but nope.  Guess it's just a result of their payment model.  I'm starting to prefer sub-based games despite the fact that they are (objectively) a rip-off, just because it really cuts down on gating items behind real money.  
---
Sigh.
---
I love this game but the lack of good rewards has been an issue since launch so I've lost faith that the devs are actually going to do anything about it.  I mean hell, their solution to people complaining about lack of good rewards was to make everything worth shit grindy as fuck so that gives me a good glimpse into what their philosophy about it is.  
---
Seems like this mount will be completely worthless in PvE. Kind of a balsy move if you ask me, considering this episode marks the end of the current content cycle.
---
I wonder what will they add (And that is even IF they add anything) to keep PvE players busy until the next content cycle drops.
---
Last episode was drier than a bone, and since the mount will be WvW focused, it seems the new episode will have even less content than the previous one.
---
Is there a way to reset a hero's challenge?   
---
I was doing the "Aging Ale Barrels" in the Lostvyrm Cave.     
---
The visual is so busy, specially when the wurms are all over me, i must have clicked on not "Leave it alone".   
---
Is there a way to reset, or allow to complete?  
---
thank you.   
---
&gt;And yes I am going to get defensive if you’re going to claim “white privilege” is a thing.
---
Because it is. If you take it personally when someone points out a fact of life, sorry, that's on you. I already explained to you what it is and how it works and you still choose to believe it's something it isn't, and there is TONS of literature explaining the concept in detail, and still you seem to think it's some sort of personal insult or implying you have no problems. That's just you being willfully ignorant, friendo.
---
&gt; My point is that ANet is messing up from a fundamental level, not that players are being antagonistic.
---
I agree with that.
---
I'd troll my friends so hard with that.
---
lol the rage and that nick, priceless.
---
Aug?
---
I don't have it. The number of chests from W3 Escort I have missed is incalculable.
---
How is criticism of the patches a headache to the devs when they never look at any of it anyway? 🤔
---
&gt; Seems like this mount will be completely worthless in PvE though, so, so much for that. Kind of a balsy move, considering this episode marks the end of this content cycle.
---
It is truly a balsy move because it brings nothing to the table. I believe mounts have no place in WvW along with gliders. Moreover, it's not going to make WvW more fun or engaging.
---
&gt; I wonder what will they add (And that is even IF they add anything) to keep players busy until the next content cycle.
---
Nothing as always. 
---
&gt; Just because the bar is low doesn't mean you can't trip over it.
---
Fair enough. However, I do not think that this is going to impact the PvE side in any form or shape. They don't have to bother implementing mechanics for this mount in the future maps nor make any PvE-related achievements. As far as I remember they have 2 or 3 teams constantly working on the living world episodes, thus PvE content should be safe.
---
What I really actually want out of WvW is a quick join zerg battle. Fights all day, in varied scenarios. Maybe WvW is okay at creating those scenarios, but there's a lot of traveling and waiting to fight instead of actually fighting.
---
they would never understand anyway. 
---
The funniest thing about this response is that it reads almost verbatim to what people were asking for a half-decade ago. That class-balance pipe dream, though. I respect the tenacity of the folks holding out hope.
---
What's wrong with being able to escape/disengage from combat via gliding? Why shouldn't I be able to do that? It makes sense so why should it not be an option? You keep assuming wrongly that everyone thinks just like you and wants the same thing as you and other such people as yourself. That is incorrect. You are a minority. I for one think Gliding was a huge improvement to both combat and movement in WvW. You also make the wrong assumption that only you and others like you understand WvW combat. You aren't some elite special snowflake and WvW isn't rocket science that is only confined to the elite few to understand. Stop trying to make it sound like everyone else is retarded and you are the one with all the understanding. Its people like you who make WvW a bad experience for everyone involved. Instead of bashing others and the devs for trying to inject something fresh into a stale formula and to try to get more players exposed to another game mode, learn to be more open-minded to change.
---
I welcome the mount! Change is good! 
---
Exactly. Imagine the PvE waypoint rush to bosses in a PvP mode. How frustrating would it be to beat a group of people, get ready to capture an objective, and have the same group rushing full speed and full health back on mounts at your face. Sure this can be balanced with speed and power of the mounts, but the idea of them doesn't really mesh well with WvW in the first place...
---
Mounts tend to have crap health, so I imagine this will only make it easier for small roaming groups to take out objectives if those objectives are 100% undefended. In which case, the objective should absolutely fall. As a roamer, one of the worst feelings is coming on and killing it raiding camps solo but I can't do shit to the towers because I have to carry an assload of siege.
---
I am too...
---
But it's more the type of exitement you have when you light a fuse of which you don't know wether it leads to a 100 lbs bomb under your house or a majestic firework setup on the beach
---
"I don't play WvW but in my opinion this change is good idk why you whiners don't enjoy it"
---
Good Evening, Episode 6 will be brought to you by us, Team 3. You may know us from previous releases, such as Bitterfrost Frontier, Siren's Landing and Domain of Kourna.
---
Maps are a big thing for me too. The Desert BL is absolutely beautiful, but of course it makes large scale battles hard. I at least see it having some niche fun once in a while though if every borderlands was different and had unique playstyles (where your icy map idea comes in). Also agree in that it'd be nice for EotM to have a use because it's also quite fun. 
---
&gt; That is the exact opposite of what I'm afraid of. Exactly that this WON'T impact PvE any way or another. Essentially, it's dead content for PvE that adds nothing to that part of the game.
---
I mean, this content has nothing to do with PvE. It's an exclusive mount for WvW designed specifically with WvW in mind. Why would it impact PvE in any way when it wasn't designed to?
---
&gt;The thing is, now that season 4 is over, there's going to be the usual content drought (bigger than usual), but instead of an expansion to anticipate we'll jump straight into season 5.
---
Anet mentioned that season 5 will have expansion-level features. It's kind of hard to understand what they wanted to say with it, but I can only assume that they will try impliementing complitely new features that do not involve mounts. 
---
&gt;HoT sold less than release and PoF sold less than HoT, do you think that with S4E6 potentially offering nothing before a drought, and with no expansion to look forward to the game will survive?
---
It's been like that forever since LS3 started year later after HoT release. While I agree that PoF is MUCH, MUCH, MUCH worse than HoT, I do not think that another content drought is going to kill the game. 
---
A little late: [Masters of the Universe GW2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCDqJf4yI-Q)
---
You can fit the the Thunderhead peaks meta into that first list. Start with;
---
 North THP -&gt; Matriarch -&gt; (Casino) -&gt; Gerent -&gt; South THP -&gt; Octovine -&gt; Death branded Shatter 
---
Mounts will make gates go down more quickly.
---
There should be a book to store blueprints in,  like the living story portal scrolls. 
---
The WvW mount isn't being released with the episode 6, so I doubt it will effect it at all.
---
agreed! I tried condi mesmer last season and I hated myself for doing this to other people.  
---
This season, I am playing power shatter with GS//SW/F and I am having an absolute blast !
---
I think people underestimate the good this change can do assuming the obvious pitfalls are avoided (limitations on the rope ability, movement exploits, etc).
---
Zergs might be mobile enough to actually have time to mass and prevent the enemy from snowballing (more big fights and less one-sided!).  Roamers/havoc groups might have a viable cheap siege option for undefended objectives.  Conversely, there will be more frequent and meaningful opportunities for defenders.  And the most obvious, immobile builds might be less punishing to play.
---
Sure, there's some things lost in the mix, and the actual implementation may be more/less restrictive than I imagine.  That said, I think it has more potential for good than the whiners realize.  The final thing to consider is that if monetization of WvW goes well they have more incentive and means to spend developer time on it.
---
Agreed. Here's hoping guild leaders eschew pessimism for opportunism. If anything, this'll be a great chance for wvw guilds to recruit and expand. 
---
Phew at least no weird weather conditions to postpone the announcement. 
---
Honestly, you should be able to create traps that instantly dismount players like in Path of Fire 
---
I have to ask, are there plans in episode 6 for something to hold us over until season 5 drops?
---
While pretty, living world episodes have very little long term content to them. And since season 5 from 4 will have a natural delay, I want to know if there are plans for something to keep us busy.
---
Bear in mind pressing F on anything dismounts you, including portals.
---
Agreed on the balancing. Raptor pulls and bunny CCs and high jump, skimmer evasion all seem incredibly hard to deal with. 
---
I do not mind this addition.
---
I'm sorry but this is a terrible argument.
---
"Let's introduce unbalanced stuff so more people pay money to unlock said content"
---
It's most likely the scenario we are looking at but it should never be condoned by the player base. The moment you have to introduce paid gameplay advantages to boost sales your product failed.
---
Also... I'd expect the abilities to be overtuned. Just look at the other mounts. Add to that Arenanet seems to have no idea what they want to do with WvW and it can only turn out like a massive shitshow for the first few days/weeks.
---
I was amused at first, and then increasingly worried. 
---
I'll start the salt storm I guess?
---
Can't wait to see 50 of these things pulling down gates in 5 seconds because knowing ANet they literally don't bother checking how things work before throwing it in there awww yisss.
---
&gt;No, that's my point. Since the mount is WvW focused that means unless they surprise us with something completely new and unique (like I don't know, a horde mode or something), the new release will offer very little content for PvE players past the 2 hour story.
---
I mean, they threw a bone to WvW players. I see absolutely nothing wrong with that since WvW didn't get something cool in ages. Moreover, it doesn't impact PvE content developement in any case nor does it downplay anything developed specifically for PvE. 
---
&gt;Especially considering said "expansion level" features most likely won't be usable outside open world if past expansions are anything to go by.
---
It depends on what they want to do. It could be just a giant lie and we're not getting anything interesting for a few more years. I prefer to tone down my speculations because anet will never meet them anyway.
---
&gt;If season 5 is anything like season 4, the game's fucked.
---
You are probably going to be disappointed since Anet rarely takes any risks. They'll probably stick to their safe formula and keep doing what they are doing. Moreover, you can't develop a good expansion in 1 year. It's been 1,5 years since the release of PoF, thus I think that season 5 is there to just stall for time till they are ready show something.
---
I like my popcorn salty anyway
---
Calm down, buddy, you're trying too hard. I'm sure people will like you if you just be yourself.
---
&gt; Yet Chrono will continue it's 3+ year grip on the meta for as long as it is the only profession that can bring both Quickness and Alacrity.
---
This is honestly the only reason I dislike Chronomancer. It just defines the PvE meta and has since it was added in HoT. If also devalues just about every other support. It's getting better, of course, but it's still an unhealthy class for the game in my opinion. It kinda just does everything the best depending on your build (top-tier DPS, the best support, the best tank, etc).
---
God damn I would give gold if I wasn't poor this is brilliant good sir.
---
They could make money on stuff that doesn't mess with sieging, choke points, and squad movement. The main glider I see is the WvW crafted back piece, are they making bank off of WvW players since gliding was introduced? I'd like a mount of some sort for stuff like desert map open spaces and canyons but this is dumb and no on will spend money on a dead game mode.
---
Have you ever played TF2, and thought the Gunslinger was so jarring and difficult to use? Have you ever played Zoe in League and thought she was a bit underpowered and clunky? Put in a little practice, watch a few tutorials, and you begin to realize that yes, it does require *some* practice, but once you get it down ....... ***you're just the newest recruit of the fun police***
---
I’m at work but go to YouTube and search for “the wall” build for dark souls. That’s how imagine you guys
---
Good point on not taking it first run. 
---
The most fun commander I had (they were from a link server) had a hit and run tactic. Made sure supply was low on keep, and to get it drained, while keeping supply from camps locked down. We would rush the outer gate/wall and break through it and hide 2 mes inside. Then we would leave. We were on an outnumbered map, so even better. Ported back in through outer 15+ minutes later and rushed inner to cap it before anyone noticed. Easier to do on red BL because there are lots of places to hide. Got two t3 keeps in primetime, which my server is not good at. I've yet to see anything organized like that on my server again in over a year. It takes a competent group. All too often 75% of the zerg are just pressing the 1 button riding along for the k-train, but this group was great. 
---
I wonder how many more players they have for each living world update, and then how swiftly those people don't log in again until the next content patch. It's insane how little sustainable content this game has!
---
What did he chose in the end?
---
I’ve seen blobs and blobs and blobs across several servers that would put pve blobs to shame that seem to disagree with you there, champ.
---
to those gentlemen claiming there is "too little information" to be upset or simply concerned, i have but one thing to say: there is precedence, and plenty of it.
---
k. thx. by.
---
Ash, because he's trash. Pretty trash though 
---
ESO combat is mostly terrible. However, they communicate their road map, so they've got that going for them. 
---
&gt; You also know nothing about which mount skills will be allow or if any of the existing mount skills will be allowed.
---
this right here tells me you didnt even read any of it
---
I am pleased with the fact that you can glide only on the territory that you own. I don't mind having bonuses on a territory that you have claimed.
---
I understood that reference.
---
It's more about why they took a risk instead of fixing core issues. Nobody left the mode because there were no mounts. I doubt many people are going to come into wvw and stay long term because mounts now exist.
---
In PvE yeah. I'm wondering if it'll work differently in WvW.
---
People want good changes.
---
Legitimately my favorite dye, and it costs virtually nothing.
---
With the way that kind of content works, it's pretty much not possible to let people do it after the window has closed and the story's moved on. Unless, of course, you make heavy use of instancing like they did with GW1.
