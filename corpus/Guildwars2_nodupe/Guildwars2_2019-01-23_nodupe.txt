Yes, security issues. 
---
---
---
I’ve never used the auto login anyway. Can someone explain why so many people are upset? What does it matter if you have to click a couple more times to login in?
---
There already are enough ways...
---
Loving the wvw updates!
---
Good. Fox and Wolfgirls are superior 😤
---
Yep. Hi there. o/ I confirm i'll set the place around 8:00pm utc next week-end. ;-) Just like every saturday and every sunday. 
---

---
Glad you'll join us.
---
So far, we've had three success and unfortunately a very frustrating failure. Last zealot (phase 2) had 2% life and... Boom. XD 
---
Just a reminder: It's a [Eu] server community event. I hope our [NA] fellows will find a weekly lead soon. 
---
See you &lt;3
---
You don't need to hop right into a match. You can spend as much time as you want in the Heart of the Mists (PvP Lobby) where you can freely play around with, test, and learn all about everything that is unlocked at your own pace. 
---
Just use the gw2 launcher? Your password is encrypted there.
---
They just look like fat humans with lion heads. I don't see any chairs either, yet two appear to be sitting.
---
This was exactly my point of view until I tried Mirage. Give it a try.
---
Lucky tp player can make 1k gold in a hour 
---
Probably...
---
I can only store 1 password in there
---
It's almost like wolf/fox ears have the same general aesthetic because *they're ears from the same animal.*
---
[I mean, at least GW2's ears have jewelry.](https://i.imgur.com/XSctqoh.jpg)
---
I didn't know Anet was controlled by EA
---
FYI that is a horrible method. Just use symlinks and you don’t need multiple windows accounts. 
---
The idea of creating 37 windows accounts for a game is insane to me. &gt;.&gt;
---
"same weakling since the start of guild wars 2"
---
Speak for yourself man I'm a freaking *Firebrands* now.
---
I'm not sure what ports GW2 uses aside from 80, but are they blocked on your router?
---
I can't believe this game keeps delivering drama every once in a while... A really amazing game that went to hell thanks to some ridiculous agenda and bad decision making from the developers/game director...
---
But the target is the gw2 shortcut, not a certain person. 
---
Accounts plural, not singular. 
---
Oh my
---
Good idea, will investigate further.
---
Farm my full home instance, craft daily ascended mats, login rewards, etc.
---
Goodness. Don't use AutoHotKey for what Keepass was designed for. https://keepass.info/ and your logins are stored securely in an encrypted DB with auto-completion based on window name with the ability to allow you to select from multiple logins in cases where you have more than one.
---
So for example, you could have LoginA, LoginB, LoginC for Guild Wars 2, you setup a Keepass entry for each login with the appropriate password for each, then you tie those logins to the Guild Wars 2 login window so Keepass knows that those logins are bound to that program and when you press whatever your Auto-Completion keystroke is, it'll pop open a dialog to allow you to choose which account it should enter from among LoginA, LoginB, or LoginC (it will only suggest logins that you've tied to that window) and then it will fill in the login automatically and submit it. It can do this for everything on your computer so you need only know the password to decrypt your database and you're good to go.
---
I think I followed your instructions correctly, but it prompts me for a password in the cmd?
---
`Attempting to start C:\Program Files (x86)\Guild Wars 2 - B\Gw2-64.exe as user "DESKTOP-HO5UTJO\MYNAME" ...
---
Enter the password for MYNAME:`
---
**Easy Solution:** Create a batch file in the GW2 executable's folder with these 4 lines, and the number incremented by one for each (I've shown with 2 examples for clarity). The first time you run this, it will create a folder \\a#\\ and a new local.dat. Type your name and password, ensure they are set to save, then close and move on to A2, A3, etc..
---
There is no need to copy local.dat files around, it keeps one for each account.
---
The only remaining downside is it takes a few clicks longer to get through the launcher screen - but your names and passwords will be saved for each!
---
I keep a list of which A# is associated with which account, but it's not really necessary since you see the email address for the login on each.
---
`setlocal`
---
`set userprofile=%appdata%\Guild Wars 2\a1`
---
`Gw2.exe 1`
---
`pause`
---
`set userprofile=%appdata%\Guild Wars 2\a2`
---
`Gw2.exe 2`
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Have been using GW2Launcher for months
---
Can confirm it works just fine after the patch, just have to manually log in.
---
The little bouncy chest that appear a above your minimap when you complete most non-core events.
---
It's a good thing the animation on the tentacles is so rigid that it looks bad. No loss.
---
Uh? Do you expose your personal files to the world? Because that's the only realm in which these two situations are in any way equivalent. If the file is on your machine and never leaves it, it is fundamentally the same as typing it in to gw2. In fact, it'd be more "dangerous" to type it into gw2 if you had a keylogger because if you're ripping it out of a text file, you aren't typing it.
---
As noted, this GWlauncher is an adequate replacement until (if) Launchbuddy is modified.
---
https://github.com/Healix/Gw2Launcher
---
Another local.dat file, another account. 
---
Read the other comments, it's mentioned here. Some people even wrote the whole batch file on their comment. It's almost just copy and paste.
---
Saying the class focuses on range when it doesn’t isn’t an issue of introducing too many complexities early on. It just gives people the wrong idea about a class. People aren’t suggesting a description of the way missile cones work be included.
---
"you can do it but we won't make it easy for you anymore."
---
Time and effort ?
---
One squad, full of course = 15 minutes of playing, maybe twenty and it's done. For a daily mosaic.
---
Remind me how much people/squads and how many time of waiting/opening chests are needed for doing HoT meta ? 
---
People this it's hard but no, it's not. ;-)
---
Excuse me a second whilst I go chuck myself into a wood chipper.
---
thats how i did it before, how do i continue doing that now with the -user and- pass disabled? do i have to shortcut something else now?
---
"multiple accounts" wouldn't make any sense in singular...
---
Like I said, the option is already there.
---
Logging into one account is fine.
---
Now, logging into 10, 20, 30, 40 accounts? Not so much.
---
Guess we have different interpretations then. I don't really see how the post was related to the topic. Nor do I see the value in even posting it since whoever did it was probably done at that point. And even if they werent then do you really think posting asking them to stop would make them? No wonder the queue is so long if you're wasting time like this.
---
Most importantly, if someone can access your PC in order to read out some shortcut parameters, you have much, much bigger problems than your GW2 account.
---
Hey.. I never liked mesmers either, but condi mirage is a blast. Seriously, try it out, it's worth giving it a chance
---
Thank you very much for all the work on LB over the years.
---
I want my money back for the accounts i have bought..
---
Yaaaa that won't be caused by a 120 ping lol. I played on dial up back when it came out. I had much worse ling than that. You have some other issue, absolutely not the ping. 
---
Well, they fixed a security issue. You should be happy.
---
50 fps in lions arch is VERY good bro, the game just isn't optimized incredibly well.
---
Does that now produce a drop down menu with your multiple account's stored account names and passwords?  
---
That should not a difficult thing for them to add, even encrypted... But they almost certainly won't.  So by mission of action they have covered their own asses legally by throwing all the multiple account users under the bus.  
---
My guess is that they had some really big security foul up and are trying to dodge it by hanging it on their customers.
---
Didn't they say they would buff the stash rewards and make it so you could only do one event per account? 
---
If someone gets access to your PC to read out some shortcut parameters, your GW2 account is the least of your worries.
---
Just curious, what niche do you see a new pet filling? Only thing I could think of would be something similar to the Oakreart hookshot mastery, but in pet form. Or maybe a wall walk ability...
---
What's the best way to farm Karma?
---
Gonna go out on a limb and guess that any place with Karmic Retribution is great. But I just want to make sure that there isn't anything better available. There's much I don't know.
---
You seem to be shifting the blame of your actions onto the company. These are all items that are either not P2W or obtainable just through gameplay. The gambling portion is an optional activity. The fact that you have clearly no control over your actions does not mean the game should be at fault. Now, that being said, there are many companies that provide these lootboxes in ways that ARE designed to hurt people for monetary value. P2W rng (either through gating progress or providing broken items) or constantly shoving it in consumers' faces. ANet doesn't do either of these things. They provide the cosmetic lootboxes and allow you to convert in-game currency into paid currency, allowing people to obtain the same items with just gameplay. 
---
I agree that some cases of game gambling take it too far and should be checked on, but blaming your lack of self control on the company is just childish and a little scummy. You are in charge of your own decisions mate. You are your own person. 
---
Humans were not given free will to blame their actions on another power outside of their control.
---
For those upset about this because they're unable to multibox with launchbuddy: you can still multibox by just launching the game from launchbuddy without any account selected and it will open the launcher. You'll have to type in usernames and passwords -- which is inconvenient and annoying, absolutely -- but it's still possible to multibox with a bit more effort. Hope this helps folks who are worried about not being able to multibox at all.  
---
In the long run there can \*probably\* be a workaround in launchbuddy to utilize the existing dat files, so there may still be hope of being able to use similar workflows in the future, but for now this may be the easiest way to continue multiboxing.
---
Wth Anet?!
---
Partly what Rena said I agree with but I also think it's the lack of breadcrumbs to it. Other games usually lead up to giving you a quest to go do it, so you feel obligated to do it at least once - that breaks the ice. Once you're in it, many discover it isn't that hard and do the others as well. WoWs Raid finder difficulty, in my opinion, shot themselves in the foot by giving that easy way out to say "been there, done that" to players that hadn't tried raiding but were given incentive to try - it's too easy and there are too many players in them to really give a good example of skills you'll need. Here, it is essentially its own game mode and has less "test the waters, you'll be fine" for both fractals and raids. Raids may not need it, but at least a letter invite to go see the fractal observatory would be cool.
---
Since the actual Lunar New Year is happening earlier, it makes sense ANET would have the Festival earlier too. The Lunar calendar is weird like that, I guess?
---
Jesus. Why would someone have so many accounts?
---
please don't feed the trolls
---
 
---
&gt;**Additional Late Note:**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Domain of Istan: Chest contents have been improved for Palawadan and the Mordant Crescent Great Hall. Players are limited to 30 chests in Palawadan and 12 chests in the Mordant Crescent Great Hall per day per account.
---
F
---
Honestly it's probably just anet deciding they don't really like people with multi accounts and since they already allow them, they can't outright change that, so they resort to this. Hopefully they'll change this back but until then, enjoy your break and thanks for all the work on Launchbuddy!
---
Mate, they've been saying similar things for years. I'm sorry if you believed anything would actually come of it.
---
To your edit: start with magi (buyable with karma from merchants in Orr). If you need trinkets, go with exotic givers with platinum doubloons in the upgrade slot. 
---
To get weapons without crafting, do the druid elite spec collection for the ascended staff, and stat swap that to harrier. If you have an extra character slot, you can also do the tempest and weaver elite spec collections for an ascended warhorn and sword respectively.
---
yeah its is just not the same ... the main advantage of autologin was avoiding the launcher altogether and starting the game directly.
---
anet could have just reworked the parameters to not require the info in cleartext, there enough ways to do it, but apparently anet refuses to give that to us
---
it's not the same the main advantage of autologin was avoiding the launcher altogether and starting the game directly
---
Thanks for your work, man!
---
If I cant anymore multi, no more money for them, that its. time to move on.
---
I understand having several accounts. It just doesn’t seem productive after maybe the 10th though. The time it would take to do all of those things that many times would outweigh the gain.
---
Around 5x3 months from now.
---
I started playing a week ago. Im level 60. Last night my guild convinced me to try pvp.
---
It was awesome!  Plus you get rewards, with wvw having even better rewards.  Give it a shot.
---
Did this fix the invisible mobs in Fractals and such?

Many people seem to forget that I've made a bunch of PvP guides that have been very widely accepted. smh

Thank you for making launchbuddy to begin with. I am sorry to hear that you will be taking a break from it but I completely understand why. I wish the best for you
---
Ranger is good in all modes you’re just looking to specific a playstyle for it to be if you were to be running a Power SB in WvW on what is currently your Druid you could have strong builds in both modes. The same goes for Guardian where power DH is in a strong position.
---
PLEAAASE let this be it. I beg for it on my knees if I have to.
---
I chuckled. 
---
Last expansion was announced 4-5 months prior to releasing it, so don't expect it.  
---
We may now go to a new LW Season that may last another year until we hear for an expansion, unless devs have planned it otherwise.
---
does launch buddy still works? 
---
Yes, thanks for the links, had these in mind in my #3 but couldn’t remember exactly, but figured a search would turn them up.
---
I'll have you know that i made Legendary Armor for the sole purpose of forcing me to play Chrono, needles to say it didn't work, just couldn't get over the pink skills, idiotic, i know.
---
2nd post in the forum thread. It's fixed :D
---
Stop it. Twisted metal was my favorite PS game ever. 
---
Keepass will do both for you.
---
Store all GW2 logins in Keepass, select login to use, swap to GW2, and press Global login key combination (for me it's Control+Alt+(+), you can change it  however).  Simples.
---
i wouldnt if i were you
---
Unfortunately that release note went out a bit early due to an integration issue, so not *quite* yet. Stay tuned!

jesus the butthurt over this is kinda hilarious.  ngl.
---
this fixed my 2 biggest gripes with this episode - purple plate and crashes during meta. I'm very happy :D
---
agreed. happy cake day
---
I understand 2 or 3 accounts but why 12? im genuinely curious.
---
hehey! thanks! 
---
Name checks out.
---
I had help from reddit joining two ideas together.
---
The final result was an amazing script command line type menu that allows you to simply pick which account you want to play, it lainches the local.dat file containing the appropriate encrypted login info for the requested account.
---
It doesn't let you launch multiple at the same time.
---
That can be done as well but it wasn't a focus of mine at the time. 
---
2 months actually
---
yup, not to be rude but /r/GuildWarsDyeJob/ is what you're looking for.
---
This was my experience too, it's crazy. I boosted my mesmer and regretted it for the longest time because it felt like I hit like a wet noodle. Then I went axe mirage and it's the most fun thing ever. I'm laughing at ANet's description of Mesmer, because "requires finesse and practice"? I press axe 2 twice, then spam dodge and axe 1 and suddenly my enemy has \~40 torment stacks on it. It's so much fun. I absolutely recommend trying it out.
---
Removing things take zero or very little effort, development-wise. Adding new stuff - like what you proposed - would cost them money.
---
And don't get me wrong, I have 5 accounts and I'd love what you suggested, but I know Anet doesn't spend time on anything unless they can make money out of it, and this is something so niche I don't have many hopes of it ever happening.
---
TBH, multi-boxing is/has always been toxic and game breaking -- even in other MMOs.
---
The issue is with the patch UI. You can try to use emulate a virtual desktop in winecfg, but that causes issues for me on my 3 monitor setup. Since they disabled `-nopatchui`, I have to be ready to switch to tty2 to kill the process if it freezes.
---
Don't we already have a cat ears cosmetic? They could be doing this years before.
---
Gw2 seriously needs engine upgrade.
---
[removed]
---
One account = over 50g a month just from login rewards.
---
This guy is making 600g/month by just logging in on his accounts. That's why.
---
How do you get them via wvw?
---
Yes. I know.
---
Don't we have all the celestial/starry skins? Or do you mean something else? I know I have the starry griffon
---
i do, why i have 12, i dont ever have to farm, i log in to them, used to take about 5 minutes and id just live off the login rewards
---
Seriously, this is the unique thoughtful appropriate sort of items that really make me appreciate what fashionwars can be. Hats off to the team that did these, they're great.
---
Wish they weren't in a RNGbox but I understand, money is nice. 
---
Please reimplement it again.
---
daily login rewards mostly, they generate alot of gold over a month, why spend money on gems when you can add another gold generating acount and live off that instead of farming
---
Oh no, PvE nerds can't abuse multiple accounts for an unfair amount of dailies. It's amazing they allow multiple accounts at all. 
---
Shit company.
---
I'm not sure what you're getting at, perhaps if you were a wee bit more vehement. 
---
Looks horrible
---
What Anet did was a really bad move for all of us. It's so sad that after all your work they did this just a week after u release the new LB .
---
You can convert your ahk into an exe after you have it setup as you like and that will remove the plain text aspect.
---
Pretty sure colin said expansion is worked on half a year after hot
---
Its ok ill use a bot 
---
How so? Sounds more like you don’t understand what is allowed in gw2 multiboxing. 
---
You have wry other AP? Unless you do, then they got you by more then 50.
---
Points for song reference!!
---
Does your Launchbuddy UI switcher work? I am able to get the clients going but am forced to swap active client with alt-tab 
---
So I know they removed the email and password commands but is -nopatchui bugged or they also remove that?
---
i wouldnt call it trash. i would like to see more posts about the game, not art. i agree with you on that. i dont discourage other people for their art or the content of their art. thats just being an asshole
---
it worked at first but now the scripts dont work, just sits on the batch file, not quite sure were i went wrong
---
You can't use the auto login like before on launchbuddy, no. But you can launch multiple clients and tell the gw2 launcher to remember them. You can make new dat files for each login, so run multiple clients.
---
Dragonhunter's traps dont work against some bosses. Such as the one against Kralkatorrick and the Claw of Jormag
---
those pins are soooo expensive though.
---
still i do look for event squads if they're ever available.
---
Oh well...in this genre, I played only [Death Rally](https://youtu.be/qdGters14Ps)...
---
Drooburt took red dumplings last year, not the pigs, as I recall.
---
Something less akin to galaxy mounts and more akin to ghost-like mounts with stars connected to zodiacs inside them.

At first I was hype but then my hula-hoop dreams were shattered ;_;
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
I only have one account so I don't use this, but did they really change things one week after you released a major update? That doesn't sound like coincidence.
---
Also, explain to me how it's totally legit to multibox in ranked PvP but God Forbid you have login shortcuts? I don't care what the rules say, the ethics of that is beyond me. 
---
Thread removed: Re-posting is not allowed.
---
idk what you on about but using the local.dat file  you can't avoid using the launcher anymore and brings some other inconveniences aswell
---
I CANT TELL ANYMORE
---
I am Chinese too. There are plenty of calendars made for the Chinese that say boar. Essentially they're interchangeable in terms of the Lunar New Year.
---
LB was actually one of the big tipping points for me to get an extra account.  When I heard I wouldn't have to enter in my information every time and could run both accounts at the same time, I was game.  Sad that this has made you not want to keep developing the program (for now anyways).
---
Thanks for everything, /u/TheCheatsrichter and those who helped make LB what it is today.
---
Exactly. 
---
Pun-approved!
---
:tinfoil:  
---
That is a fair point though, especially since luck can now be directly converted to gold. Anet didn't want too much liquid gold generated from alts?
---
Not everyone is as lucky as you, mate.
---
gemstore backpacks like the Sloth, Rox's Quiver, Fire Quiver etc... 
---
but but but but but it is one gold per hour better than the rest of the game! :^)
---
So was the password option sending pws in the clear? If so then it should have been removed long ago (or never existed). And if so it was a huge security vulnerability.
---

Ooh! I'm picturing something akin to the Mad Realm skins texture wise with connected points of light inside. 
---
I'm so sorry to hear that :( I've been there so I can understand the pain, truly.
---
Thank you for your commitment and for the wonderful launcher. I do have multiple account but the main reason I got the launcher was to use the old GW2 beta login feel.
---
I've decided I'm going to try GW2Launcher and see if I can get it to work. I'll try both methods and see which feels better to me.
---
If you can't field a raid team because you're a terrible elitist then i have bad news for you.
---
For what it's worth, while I've never really had a reason to use this, it's easily one of the coolest programs for GW2 out there. So, thanks for the work you and everyone have put into this!
---
Make sure to check all the menus in setup and settings (right click to get menus). 
---
I've been searching a bit more and it has all the graphics presets like launch buddy.
---
Sacrificing convenience to baby people who don't understand basic internet security is never a good thing. At some point they have to deal with their own mistakes.
---
I have had a crippling gambling addiction that caused me to spend $2-3k a month on mobile games, loot boxes, tf2 crates, etc. It was killing me slowly. Then one day I realised "Wow, this is a really bad activity that's sending my money off somewhere that I'll never see again, and the items I'm getting for my money aren't really worth it in the long run. I'm making bad decisions knowing full well the bad effects it's having on me. I need to stop"
---
And guess what: I stopped. I made a budget. I did some self reflection. It's not "victim blaming", it's pointing out that regardless of the activity, we are all solely responsible for our own actions. It's nobody else's job to moderate your addictions.
---
I have no problems with finding a team, don't worry :)
---
Also have this issue.  Tried re-doing it just to be sure but since it's already been completed the game isn't looking at the kill count anymore.
---
I’m creating a set of armor for a raiding healing Druid, but apparently superior monk runes can’t be bought from TP and are a pain to get. Are there any similar runes that could take its place, those of which I could purchase via TP?
---
Straight-up Berserker's may LOOK such, but look for exotic Ruby trinkets (MUCH cheaper zerker stats + zerker gems, for roughly 3g per item, with ~15g total for all five trinkets (2x rings, amulet, 2x earring)). Also for the backpiece, the lucky lanterns from Lunar New Year are pretty cheap and offer berserker stats. 
---
As for runes and sigils, Scholar is usually a good power baseline for the former, and Force and Air for the latter. 
---
If you want, let me know your account name and I can get this for you if you find yourself lacking in gold :)
---
No, I said that SOME companies design their loot boxes with the intent to procure monetary value from peoples' bad habits by way of REQUIRING people to purchase loot boxes to keep up with the rest of the player base. Purely cosmetic loot boxes don't work like that. They don't affect gameplay.
---
But it's chinese new year
---
Finally I can finish this focus. Ty Anet. 
---
So this has become more apparent with the release of Thunderhead Peak, but apparently has been like that for a while: Branded Strongboxes dropped by killing champions don't drop any loot aside of mats and Bloodstone Dust.
---
It's called the Lunar New Year in game and while it is based on the Chinese New Year it is not the same as the in-game festival is from the Cantha region. 
---
Dude this command has existed forever and it exists for GW1. This isn't some security concern. It's just a dumb decision on their part that comes out completely out of left field. 
---
To me it's not even about the time it takes to swap accounts but being able to multibox so I can do all of my dailies at once and save my time to go and actually play. I'm not interested in having to swap files around each time to do this.
---
Wait..we used to have autologin???? Dammit a feature we had that now we've lost, that I wanted , that I didn't know we had. Dayyum
---
I never said anything about the joke being good or bad, I said that it was a joke.  Whether or not Nike was serious or making a joke is a fact, its a fact we don't know (so we have to speculate based on the evidence we see), but it is a fact.  It is an objective thing.  The opinions about the statement expressed by clicking like or dislike do not change that status into an opinion.  If you believe Nike was making a joke, then yes it is completely fair to rate how funny the joke was based on peoples opinion.  But that isn't what we were discussing, we were never discussing whether it was a funny joke, we were discussing whether it was a serious statement or a joke, and then you brought up something completely separate.  I said, the statement was, 'pretty clearly hyperbole' and then you told me , 'Except for no, it doesn't. Some people genuinely have that big of an ego.'
---
You have to pick one, the statement is either a bad joke (according to the metric you've argued for) or it was a serious statement reflecting Nike's belief that DnT was, 'Without a doubt, the greatest guild in the history of the game'.  The statement can not be both serious and hyperbole.  
---
Just gonna say that if you "just stopped" then you were never addicted. You had a bad habit, but habits are easily broken while addictions are not. One takes days to create/destroy, that's habits. The other takes days to create, and months to destroy, that's addiction.
---
I wasn't referring to the word Lunar at all.
---
Agreed. As much as I've loved this series over the last decade and a half, this shit is driving me away slowly and surely. Gimme a toggle, Anet, GIVE IT TO ME!
---
Same, they focus most of the work on a few hours of content and there's nothing interesting to do again, the LS system should do more to create repeatable content
---
wow. amazing designs! i love the skritt roller beetle and charr raptor. we all need that charr raptor. lol.
---
We should also shut down the internet cause there are people suffering from internet addiction, throwing their lives away. They're not at fault, no, we should blame the internet and destroy it.
---
We should also have a regulation to limit the amount of daily food every single person consumes, cause there are people suffering with obesity, they just can't control themselves, poor souls.
---
They were probably thinking of support chrono which is basically a boon-bot.
---
Ooh Today I learned!
---
Had that happen once, so spent a few days unlocking every low level skin I could find just to avoid that in the future, still happens occasionally. I really love it when I unlock a cheap dye that I didn't have already. 
---
Effects affected you
---
It's true.  I just went through it and didn't even damage the graveling but still got the plate because I was in the room before the previous group finished killing him.
---
If it didn't require moving the mouse, sure.  But I would be highly worried about that little addition to an auto-clicker.
---
Cool thank you
---
If you have auto-play ticked on the launcher (and for each copy of local.dat), you don't even need to press play.
---
Auto-login has a 5 second countdown though.
---
&gt;Purely cosmetic loot boxes don't work like that. They don't affect gameplay.
---
They can affect players, though. Which I'd imagine is the salient part. There is no need for lootboxes. They don't add anything positive to the game. They're just there to tempt people to buy keys for what they might find. Kind of like gambling (play and who knows what you might win).
---
So you're saying because I had a strong will and beat an addiction that I never had an addiction? That I didn't spend countless nights crying wondering what the hell was wrong with me? Why I constantly went days without eating more than a meal because I couldn't afford it? But no, that's just a habit. You seem to be doing a lot of victim shaming here bud.
---
You made it sound like you "just stopped". You don't "just stop" an addiction. I am not victim shaming. You're saying that it's easy to beat an addiction, because you did such so easily yourself. Addictions are not easily beaten, no matter how strong willed you may be.
---
Now that I call you out on it, you're suddenly changing your story. Which, honestly, makes me question your claim altogether.
---
&gt; Why I constantly went days without eating more than a meal because I couldn't afford it? 
---
That has nothing to do with it being an addiction or a bad habit.
---
Gambling in it of itself isn't bad though. The PLAYER makes it an issue.
---
If only it was that little....
---
Apart from Silverwastes with a chest toon there is nothing that even comes close to Istan due to the sheer neverending cycle of that map. All other metas with great rewards (aka TD and AB) have longer cooldowns or are only useful if you want to be specific (aka Doric Leather).
---
Was Phaedra removed? I can't find her anywhere in Divinity's Reach.
---
Guess it's time to buy some crimson skin for that juicy 7bl ticket ayayaya
---
Try KeePass
---
Pretty sure I know the answer to this but is there any way to access an old account that was only using a now deleted email address? 
---
For the record, I enjoy the full exotic armor set a lot more than I expected. Not only the dmg goes up by a noticeable amount, more importantly its different outlook to the same medium armor skin I have been seeing for the pass 50 levels is really refreshing (and good looking too).
---
I did search for "power+precision+ferocity" and sort by lowest price, i think your guess of 15g is about right. As for backpack, I kind of want to wait for the lunar new year event and see how thing goes.
---
Thank you for the generosity but I think I am good. I have been running around silverwaste and verdant brink doing all sort of events and opening bandit chests and airship cargo, got around 50g to spend.
---
However, one thing seriously bug me is that I got scam by the bandit champion at silverwaste (the place with cliff and trap), I unknowingly handed her like 10g since I died to her a few times and I did not know that everytime I trigger the event 2 gold would be deducted from my bag AND if I hug the right hand wall I can get to the trap switch and spawn the boss without getting hit by the trap. I finally killed that bxxxh after like 10 tries, feels good but not worth it (all my armor broke)
---
Meh, the wings don’t bug me anymore. They would have seriously bugged me but, the gliding thing ingame was a pretty big blow to me. All of a sudden we were floating casually around all over the place with gliders that magically appear out of nowhere, just. Like. In. Archeage. 
---
No matter what you choose in this game if the profession can use a greatsword, you will be stuck with it. Frustrates me to no end. I wish there was more variation as I despise two handed weapons in any game. Ranged is nonexistent outside of open world.
---
Same bullshit excuse they used when they changed the API from using OAuth to API Keys
---
Though there are some arguments against doing it via command line arguments, you could easily come up with another solution 
---
I'm blaming him for trying to shift the blame of his addiction to companies. I'm empathetic to people with addictions, obviously because I've faced addiction myself. I'm 100% on board with helping people overcome addictions and get over the issue. However when someone tries to shift the blame over to a separate entity and refuse to take responsibility for their own actions, I stop giving a shit.
---
There's also a rich mithril node that appears near the mastery point in the Grotto
---
Genuine question: why do all good runes needs charm of brilliance and not one of the other two eg : rune of scholar, (the power builds meta( rune of snowfall (for winter presence of course) and now this (probably the new WvW meta), is it random or do the devs decide or what? 
---
 Does the XP earned from completing a toons story mode after level 80 apply towards mastery XP? Specifically. Central Tyria character story. 
---
YA BLEW IT ARENA NET, AGAIN. 
---
Will they ever learn?
---
I call bullshit on
---
&gt;Theories about alternative motivations for the change are completely baseless.
---
I am completely aware of the security risk as soon i have to type in my email and password as command line into shortcut to perform this auto login, and an even greater risk my my account crash and the command line with my email and password are listed in the crash dump. But i choose to take those risk because for i'm too tired to type in really long password and really different email (had local yahoo &amp; international gmail account) for years. What kind of bullshit is happening just now after, which happen coincidentally with Launchbuddy suddenly became popular. i'm pretty sure it just happen because someone was vetoed out when they want to ban multi boxing, then they decide to take the feature away just because they can.
---
No it didn't. You could do exactly what he said and gain infinite height. Of course, if you started flying and diving then you wouldn't be able to go back up all the way since the 'ceiling' would indeed be set to the limited height above your starting position. However, the new mastery allowed you to reset the flight ceiling.
---
Ah yeah...that. XD At least armor repair is free in this game. 
---
As for Lunar New Year, you are in luck as it started today! Hop on over to the human city (Divinity's Reach) and have fun! 
---
And if you have anything else to ask me, my IGN is maekirvilemist.1286. I try to be on regularly, so hit me up with a PM or mail any time :)

Zhaitan died quite out of sight (even some rumors that the fight was supposed to continue on ground) so we didnt see his death, just his fall.
---
Mordy, IIRC, there was quite a display when we finished Threhearne (sp?). The meta fight (mouth of mordremoth) is just us/the pact distracting Mordy while the actual fight happens on the personal instance (inside his mind). Mordy death is actually when we kill Threhearne with Calledbog.

thanks a lot! see you in Tyria =)

It's infinite, not daily either. Like Drooburt's other collections.

The fact that the command has been in the game for so long doesn't change the fact that it commits a cardinal sin of digital security: storing passwords as plain text. If anything, the only dumb decision (beyond implementing it in the first place, but I can forgive that seeing as the average user was presumably less concerned about this sort of thing 10 years ago) was leaving it in for so long and letting people get used to it. It might make like somewhat more difficult for players like you, but it would be wildly unprofessional of ANet to leave a security hole like that open and the vast majority of the game's population is better off for it.
---
Wintersday is the best karma farm. Fractals give a lot of them too via completion of dailies + Mist Attunement buff. 
---
Got it. Thanks!
---
Been researching classes and I’m looking towards ranger or Mesmer. I prefer tanky range or tanky high hp usually but am willing to step out of my boundaries. 
---
What class would you say is least played and why. 
---
If you haven't leveled up your toon, try farming the chain events south of Fort Trinity while loaded with exp buffs. It's what I always do to max my alts easy peasy. 
---
Rifle seems to be still bugged, certainly if you had it before the patch, what i understood from map chat also for people that didn't had it.
---
Focus is fixed if you hadn't done the achievement before the patch. If you did it, it's still bugged.
---
Can you do LS3 without HoT?
---
Don't forget the Karma amulet enrichment, guild hall buffs, food and utilities plus candy corn gobbler buffs xD
---
Honestly, if you have the time to multi you should have the time to type in the password manually. 
---
Your account details didn't change so just log in with that old email. If you have other issues (2FA, forgot password, etc) you would have to contact support to make any changes.
---
I honestly don't think it is a troll.. can't decide if funny or sad.
---
exactly
---
I bought extra accounts because of launchbuddy and would not have if it didn't exist.  It also means I won't be likely be any more accounts unless Anet changes this or they're able to get launchbuddy functioning again.
---
[Least played character by number is Engineer, least by playtime is Revenant](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/player-statistics) (based on added API keys). Mesmer can use the HoT elite spec Chronomancer and gain additional blocks on top of their normal evades, invulns, and other damage avoiding skills. This makes them great at tanking and avoiding damage all together. Ranger on the other hand has a pet to tank for them in open world. Both are good, if you had an idea of what you like to do (WvW? PvP? Raids? Fractals?) I could give you a better idea of what they both do. Also if you need a breakdown of the game modes I just listed I can detail that as well.
---
Damn, I wish I had thought of mute and language change. I'm playing through the story in order (currently at LWS3E2) but jumped ahead to PoF chapter one just for the raptor.
---
wow
---
May I ask what you're going to do?  For me, I'm just not logging in.  
---
I wonder how many people couldn't remember their passwords and hadn't been playing for very long and said "oh well" and left lol. 
---
Ya, getting the raptor, especially early, can make some people enjoy the game a lot more. Just sucks that it's locked behind a mission with a bunch of spoilers right away. I've run the mission for a couple people already and always tell them to just stay back and ignore everything lol.
---
I enjoy all aspects of the game looking for something pretty well rounded in PvP and pve 
---
I dont understand what the uproar is, its a single click? ELI5 please.
---
Would you mind giving us a copy of it?
---
Props for being reasonable.  Personally, I'll miss it, but I understand.
---
ive gotten a bunch of the rare bltc items, normally in a respectable key ratio; this is one of the outliers (the other one i remember wanting -and taking over 100 keys- was the jackal pup backpiece)... i actually ended up buying another 25 keys after posting this and got exalted shoulders on the second key in (and the first was a super rare glyph)
---
its the nature of rng with no failsafe; you can just get randomly screwed for no reason... but it isnt helped by anet bloating the tiers with weapon skins (a single weapon container like those used for immortal weapons would be much less obnoxious)
---
I assumed it was because he was put in there while still alive by Balthazar. Once Balthazar died, his cage disappeared and Joko left however Balthazar led him in.
---
You won't be missed.
---
I tried seraph before going harrier.  The dps was a lot better but, you couldn't carry groups like you can with harrier.  With the rune rework and sigils you can hit 100 percent burn duration with the tome for bursting and with fractal potions can have 50% boon duration for good quickness uptime.  It has almost 30k hp so you can afford to make mistakes unlike with harrier.  I just want to see how that big boost to outgoing heals makes it better at carrying.
---
Fractal farms are NOT higher rewards than istan simply due to the timegate of keys. They have vastly diminishing returns after ~40 chests (40 deeply discounted + the ones that you get from drops) and only the discounted ones are even worth buying. That maxes out your Encryption opening per day at around 70-80, with a gold gain of between 30 and 35. 
---
RIBA is only then more profitable than istan if you have a full Magic Boost Chest opener. For the average human being Istan is the way to go to farm up on something because it doesn't take nearly as much prep work (no additional otherwise useless toon required, no high Luck needed, no awkward shifting of things etc.) and has better additional loot (there are a lot of things you can do with Volatile Magic...).
---
If you can't eat bloodstone just make your teeth bloodstone
---
...but what is the purpose of having multiple accounts run at the same time on a single pc?
---
Istan \*fixed\* a broken economy. Ectos were a stupid proportion of the cost of gear until you got to ascended, leather may as well have been a different category of material to cloth and metal, trophies were either expensive as fuck or vendor trash.
---
Now most materials are fairly normalised. Nothing is drastically out of line, nothing is a disproportionate cost when crafting.
---
The economy stabilised quite easily after istan settled down, and it stabilised in a much healthier place than it was before.
---
I'm kind of a little weird in about this. I don't play single player games at all. But I do play MMOs mostly alone.. 
---
What? Minionmancers are wonderful, like who *doesn't* want to spend five hours dueling a single elite mob? Gameplay for *days*, literally.
---
Combat is very fast. The burst damage has gotten ridiculous. When you're just starting out you're going to get nuked to hell and not even know why or how.
---
I worry that many players that try sPvP are turned off by the incomprehensible beatings they get in their first few matches. I think ArenaNet could improve the sPvP population a lot just by finding some way to slow down the combat to a more "readable" level. 
---
That being said, if you can stick with it you'll slowly learn how to survive and, eventually, excel. When you finally reach a point where you can recognize the burst is coming, counter it, and waste the bad guy it is tremendously satisfying. 
---
Assuming you're selling EVERY encryption on the TP, fractal 42 is around 30 gph, and 96 is around 40:
---
[https://i.imgur.com/TUvP9GM.png](https://i.imgur.com/TUvP9GM.png)
---
These numbers only get higher if you open some encryptions with free or deeply discounted keys.
---
It was related to the topic because it was THIS topic getting spammed with reports.
---
You cozud try to test msi afterburner and manually set some speed of the fans to see if it's related to the card getting too hot. Most fan's don't do well past the 70% mark in terms of noise.
---
If the same noise will occur it means one of your fans will get defunct in some time.
---
The fans are clean of dust and since its an 970 ever thought of renewing the thermal paste on the gpu chip?
---
Got the shoulder skin and I -ADORE- it, though the fact that backpieces are still undyable, particularly the luminates backplate, will forever make me sad...
---
I am confused. Can somebody eli5 what this is?
---
Yeah I feel you , I tend to be a ranged leaning player myself.  It’s pretty frustrating when you want to range but everything’s pretty much melee only.
---
I think the only reason I can deal with power ranger gs is because the weapons fun to dodge with. Only true melee weapon I actually like lol.
---
How would anet even know that two accounts have the same owner? Preventing two different people from having the same password sounds like a terrible idea itself. Ideally anet ahouldn't even be able to tell if two accounts have the same password.
---
There are a few, actually. I use it mostly for the ability to quickly and easily transfer resources between accounts, including those of my wife and kid.
---
I’ll also use it for easily getting login rewards on all accounts at once... including wife and kid. Sometimes do home instance farming at the same time, though that’s a little time consuming.
---
During certain events (mad king mainly) I’ll alt tab like a madman to get as many tot bags as possible. Again, including wife and kid. 
---
Apart from that, there’s some smallish things like including extra accounts in group content to reap the rewards. Though I believe this has been altered out of the ToS, previously it was a grey area.
---
Can’t wait for a boots bad build making use of these on some random ass fun spec
---
Okay, important: Support and dps chrono are different builds! Which one to you play?
---
See, I’ve always avoided that because it’s technically against the ToS. 
---
It would be an option for LB, but at the same time... there’s a major difference between using random apps that manage it, and an app that specifically does it. R just don’t know how ANet would receive it. 
---
Who do you think funds this game? I never understood the problem with rng skins, it's cosmetics, that's exactly what is supposed to be purchasable for real money. There isn't any buying power it's buying pixels and in the case of rng a chance at pixels to maximize profits.
---
It cracks me up how the majority of the game is super liberal and fine with a 70% tax rate on the rich in the real world so they can get their "freebies" but god forbid a fool and his money is seperated in a video game. 
---
Okay, important: Support and dps chrono are different builds! Which one do you play or aiming for?
---
r/wowthanksimcured
---
&gt; Pun-approved!
---
i had to triple check before i got the pun.
---
Honestly, in my case, it was a combination of excitement and the big sales in the days before free-to-play was a thing. I didn't know how an extra account or three would be useful, but at $10 each, I couldn't resist!
---
But yeah, most people who go to the trouble of having multiple accounts are people who have the time to at least log into each of them daily. That brings in something like 15 mystic coins per month, plus crafting materials, BLTC containers, and whatever else you get from login rewards. If you park your characters on chests (like in Draconis Mons) or resource nodes (like the flax farm in Verdant Brink or the trees in Malchor's Leap), you can earn quite a bit. Of course, those things can be gained with more characters on your main account, too... 
---
It also looks like you're wearing a severed head on your back. 
---
I have an account on every wvw server. 
---
Well the big problem is me being in a different country now. The confirmation code they'll send me for that account will go to a defunct address.
---
&gt; The issue shouldn't be everyone be mad at Anet for taking this away. It should be, be mad at those that caused this to be taken away. Those that hack and social engineer accounts.
---
You can be mad at both. The fact that they just removed it without warning causes more concern than it is of informing people ahead of time that they're removing the function, and the fact that it's suddenly a concern now in one product, but the OTHER product still has that functionality is another cause of concern and questioning on the idea of security.
---
Time to make some sashimi. Early lunch for Konzu.
---
If you think GW2 just goes offline this year, you're more detached than ANet is.
---
Think the details if my credit card will suffice since I bought the expansions digitally?
---
Jokes on them i will save my passwords in a .txt and copy paste them.
---
Oh a Kaiji reference, man of my culture.
---
Oh my GOD that is cute!
---
Because there is some new stuff in the Black Lion Chests.
---
There are just so many ways they could improve this.   Multiple accounts could be saved under a single .dat file with a drop down menu to select what one you want, and then it could work with new shortcut commands like -account1 -password1 .. which it would pull from the .dat file to automatically login.  More accounts would use -account2 -password2, etc.  There would be no limit to how many you could have, but you can only 1 pair on each shortcut obviously.
---
thanks for the reply, will try soon
---
Just a heads up that the -email and -password commands have been removed. You can still use LB but need to leave those empty, and fill them in on launch. Unfortunately, it’s going to be a bit before LB continues most likely. 
---
-nopatchui requires email and password, so that is also pretty much disabled.
---
I’d be happy with a hash method, or an api key, or a whole lot of different things. The current way local.dat works is just broken, not to mention the settings stored in it, and the fact that the client does weird things with old local.dat files on newer clients. 
---
It's almost as if this was Anet's indirect response to the release...
---
Yep, laurels are the best overall option as a new player. 
---
I mean, there are warnings and help hotline numbers listed on every single example you just listed
---
It requires you to have tagged the monster while weilding the weapon, you don't have to get the final blow.
---
See, other tools exist for this, but they are not GW2 specific. To the point that people don’t even think about it. Such as password manager and such. 
---
But the problem I foresee is that creating a Gw2 specific tool for it may cause enough of a ruckus that something is done about it. 
---
It’s still fun mang, let him try it out without your sour taste smeared on it. 
---
There is yet to be a balanced mmorpg combat system need be reminded. 
---
Part of the reason i come back to GW2 after breaks is because i enjoy the combat.
---
If you can figure out things like block/cleanse/inting/CC life becomes a lot easier. Could it be a L2P problem lol. 
---
GW2 is an mmorpg sorry :/
---
Well Shrine Jackal was the first of the second set of non-set/licence skins, so maybe Dreadnaught is getting an outfit next?
---
My rifle achievement for killing 30 enemies seems to be bugged aswell, and it seems that the focus patch wasn't even retroactive.
---
GW1 had Kormir -&gt; got turned into a meme by the community (“I deserve this“)
---
GW2 had Trahearne -&gt; Many player had trouble with him, because our fate as his sidekick
---
At the moment, GW2 has Aurene. We might be Pact Commander, but we are just the champion aka sidekick for a creature, that has to replace an elder dragon aka has to save the world like Kormir did it with replacing Abaddon. Like in GW1, we have not the task to save the world, but to set the stage for the character, who does.
---
But since HoT, we are finally more than a sidekick to anyone, because we have found an own guild. And remember that this guild is fragile (ls3 brought several examples with pointing on every characters decision on joining, refusing or questioning the guild).
---
We are neither just simple adventurer, nor the omnipotent hero. The last scene of the current ls episode brings that on point.
---
Laurels could be worth it if you're just goi g to cash them out for crafting mats to sell, but I wouldn't hoard them for ascended trinkets - exotics are reasonably cheap on the TP for the "gearing up" period.
---
If you're talking about characters still leveling up to 80, I wouldn't stress too much there. Just stick with blue/green/yellow on your way up and buy your exotics once you're 80.
---
Fun bit: if you're not trying to max completely, lvl 78 exotics are frequently a decent chunk cheaper than 80 with only a negligible difference in stats. You probably won't need to juggle like that for later characters, but it can make it easier if you're fresh and broke. :) 
---
You can’t possibly be comparing an addiction like drugs or gambling to surfing the web. No way you are that dense. Surely you’re not that desperate to grab straws. 
---
Damn this bites.
---
It's always been hard to tell the sarcasm from the genuine ANet dickriders on the subreddit. People unironically defend every bad idea they have.
---
Seconded, I'm also super curious to know as well.
---
Wow, I didn't know any of those subs existed. And going by subscriber count it does not seem like many people do.
---
Locking cool new cosmetics behind scam boxes? Why am I not surprised...
---
Discretize is out of date(boon chrono at least) right? Just want to be sure the lack of diviners isn't because they recommend against it.
---
Hey there, thanks a lot for doing this, I'll make sure to pull my weight!
---
Atleast the 2%!!
---
Do you have any other ways for us poor people to get rich if we dont have 3 stacks of legendary luck and 325 stacks of exotic luck?
---
The skins are amazing, but they arent commercially viable for anet. The models are too different from the base models and would require a lot of work which would probably not yield as much profit as they want to.
---
Yeah. I keep looking at my gold and thinking maybe I should buy a lotta keys, because I REALLY want that skin, but it would be more sensible to wait until it shows up in the statuette vendor.  
---
Also, in my sleep deprived state, I thought the image preview was the Exodia cards from YuGiOh for some reason.
---
 Thanks! 
---
&gt; Unfortunately that parrot will keep you in combat forever
---
oh gods, I remember that.  I thought the pirate runes would be awesome when I first dinged 80 on my thief years ago, never regretted an "upgrade" so fast
---
Half of the garbage in BL chests should be locked behind achievements and hard work, not money. Could care less about some crappy rabbit backpack
---
Shouldn't we start a petition or something?
---
Fair enough. For context though the 200hp per tick means that you'd need to be healing over 1k per tick for it to be better (20% gain isn't 20% more in the end since it's all additive). That and the fact that you have lower regen and fury uptime. So in general it's better for the burst and large heals and worse for sustain and boons.
---
Ya, I'm a big fan of story and mainly doing it in order so I stubbornly went through all of season 2 getting 0 exp and having an annoying pop-up telling me to unlock mastery. They really should hide all mastery tracks till you unlock one like they do with the raid mastery now. Would let people keep getting shards and not have the pop-up until they start the expansion story.  
---
Just wait until some hot button issue pops up in the game or the community/people surrounding the game. This community can go from sweet and mild to salty and spicy faster than you can say "GW2 is the friendliest MMO around".  
---
I'd say the GW2 community is very... mercurial. 
---
You mean the karma double dip subreddit.
---
If someone is new, they probably weren't even using this tool.
---
Hahahaha, no. Coming from an IT background, I can say for sure, no, unfortunately most people aren't.
---
Well, I made it sort of work, now the newest LB won't even start. Problem was that overlay did not worked either
---
When loneliness meets social anxiety.
---
Take a look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCN3KhmsWUc), it might give you some ideas.
---
One tip I would give you is to do the low level boss events whenever they come up. It breaks the monotony of hearts, some give decent xp and it's fun for new players. 
---
Yaaaa I figured, but it somehow magically disappeared yesterday, maybe cause of the patch idk. It's all good now tho, thanks =D
---
Be assured it is
---
Theoretically, yes.
---
But those fanarts and links, for instance ? The good/appreciated ones are upvoted, the bad/low effort ones are downvoted. And there, it's not a question of relevance, but of what people want and don't want to see on the sub. And that's always been the case for all kind of threads.
---
Someone complaining about a feature or part of the game that belongs to an extrem minority will face the same fate.
---
You can't really fight the hivemind.
---
Hmh, this is a buff for owners of few accounts. 
---
I farm specific charms by looking up the list of [Karma merchants in the base game](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/List_of_karma_merchant_items) and combing through the list of Masterwork stuff while cross-referencing the wiki for the charm I'm hunting (in this case Charm of Brilliance) and find gear that has a low karma cost, is green tier, and has the rune from the list. Then I go there and pop them out with my Endless Upgrade Extractor (and portable mystic forge to fuse the karma stuff into stuff that I can salvage back for materials).
---
My go-to location for this is Firebreak Fort Waypoint in Mount Malestrom. Its got a bank, a Trading Post, and the Heart Vendor that sells some armor with Minor Runes of Rata Sum, a rune with Essence: Brilliance on it.
---
Out of some 300k karma (which got be about a 330 minor runes of Rata Sum since I got some gear back with those runes on them when I forged the karma gear, tentatively speaking 100 runes per 100k karma). Got back about 10-12 Charms of Brilliance and about 280 of Thick Leather Sections (because the heart vendor sells armor it has leather armor in addition to metal and cloth ones).
---
Honestly not *the best* way but it gives me a way to farm for specific charms.
---
for raids refer to this table https://www.snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/scourge/condition/
---
for fractals, if they care enough they won't accept. if they are chill run they will accept (but i doubt you could reach decent levels of performance with chilled run) - condi in fractals are not popular vs speed (dunno how this changes with current instabilities)
---
Power quickness firebrand is [actually pretty good](https://youtu.be/MVR0ay8hn2E) and now with diviner gear the [renegade alacrity build](https://youtu.be/8228gHSt_PM) got a whole lot better. 
---
2 different sets
---
Bruh
---
i also have the first place on the other one...but im gonna refine my route so it looks more smooth xD

I guess that's a way to make sure that pvp will keep dying, thanks to people like you who wont be good anyways :)
---
Impressive.
---
I suck at this game.
---
Bra
---
&gt; donated fried dumplings first then red dumplings
---
I dont think you need to donate 100 of each festival food btw, I dontated 5 times 100 fried dumplings and got the 25 AP.
---
Launching is not a big deal but managing windows afterward. LB overlay window is the key to smooth gameplay
---
New items in the chest
---
The game client can't change the local.dat file while using -sharedArchive, so you can't save any settings that are client side (graphics, sound settings etc).. but it still let's you run and login to multiple accounts
---
Bloodstone Spaghetti?
---
only PoF
---
It's not legit to multibox in pvp. The rules call out PvP competitive content as not allowed.
---
Yes, you will need at least Path of Fire. 
---
Laurels are used to get some [cheap ascended gear](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) and can also be [converted to gold at ~64s per](https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/laurels). To go with what others said, I'd say legendary is worth the most (but only if you need the clovers) and laurels is the next best. As for the ascended items, vision crystal is worth about 2g, 63k karma (if you buy all obsidian shards that way) and some other mats that don't have a gold value. The other 1-2 ascended materials are worth 4-6g so worst case 4g to best case 12g. If you happened to get the most you could from the ascended mats it's only ~14g worth instead of the average 13g you get for sure from laurels if you just sell them. The risk of getting 6-14g is much higher than the laurel option.
---
I've just found my answer in the Hero Menu, right at the bottom the Daredevil and Deadeye specialisations it says that I do. :)

Many thanks!

Many thanks! Worth getting both expacs anyway?

App that lets you run multiple instances of Guild Wars 2 to make it so you're able to play your main account while your alt accounts are off crafting in bulk over in lion's arch or grabbing log-in rewards. This program formerly let you do this painlessly/in a less troublesome way with the now defunct command arguments.
---
i think so,  buying both xpacs in a bundel is cheaper iirc
---
I'm still looking for a sickle axe skin for a true druid look.

I came back from an extended break away from WoW to play Legion and actually really enjoyed my time with it up to a point. Did Heroic Gul'Dan with my guild and that was pretty much me done at that point and took another extended break.
---
I came back for BfA but it's terrible. Only played for a few weeks. 
---
Sure
---
The irony of you refusing to accept I might just have a different opinion on the issue while comparing a private company refusing to do business to a totalitarian government system where private companies don't exist.
---
This has nothing to do with 1984. Stop being a drama queen, it's hard to take you if you do this.
---
I only use two at once so I use alt tab, but yeah that would be nice.
---
I suspect modifying launch buddy to use the same approach is possible though it will be somewhat tricky
---
ctrl-alt-a, actually. But it tends to bug and eat one char in the email so you have to remove the "click the login button" logic.
---
I already make it work sort of with version 1.5.3. Not work in the latest tho
---
Look at it this way. Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire are in many ways, the continuation of the Guild Wars 2 story. Lots of story threads that start in HoT carry over to PoF, so I definitely think it's worth it to have both. 
---
From a game play perspective, you're getting access to additional maps, gliding (HoT) and mounts (PoF) (which are a blast, and can be used in other non expansion maps, even the original "vanilla" maps), and other class specializations and meta events (Octovine in HoT is one of my favorites and the music is amazing)
---
The expansions are fun in their own right, but they make the base game a lot more fun too. 
---
... There was an auto-login feature? How did I not learn about this earlier? D:

To expand on some of the other comments here: So personally I always recommend starting raids on a power DPS since they are easy to gear and start (just full exotics to start with a priority on getting ascended trinkets and weapon). This way you can also work on getting raid currency to buy ascended items and work on the legendary collection that gets you a full set of ascended armor of your choice as the first reward. Let's assume you don't want to do that and are set on starting druid:
---
Don't get exotic harrier gear. [Stat swap](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing) other ascended gear or get another temporary set (exotic magi for instance, dungeons ([AC](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascalonian_Catacombs), [TA](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Twilight_Arbor), and [HotW](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Honor_of_the_Waves) for magi) are a good option here and you'll want the monk runes from AC anyways). If you do any 8 unique dungeon paths you also get [150 tokens of your choice](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chest_of_Dungeoneering). You can get a [free harrier amulet](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Path_of_Fire:_Act_2) from Act 2 mastery and a free [harrier back](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Raise_the_Banners:_Amnoon_Arbitrator) from the PoF story collection. Season 4 episode 2 has [a ring](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Difluorite_Band) to buy (which you can attune one of to use in the other ring slot) and [an accessory](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Multifaceted_Difluorite_Earrings). Otherwise you have the normal PoF vendors (tomb of primeval kings can get you daily trade contracts for little work (it's per character from the chests)), [fractals](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/BUY-2046_PFR) and [PvP](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_Armor_League_Vendor) along with raid tokens.

6,5 years of auto login and suddenly it's a security concern. For fuck's sake.

Good thing I'm in the doctor's waiting room right now, I can ask her for some cancer medication on top of the other stuff

What's completely abysmal is that ANet didn't issue any warning to developers about this. Are they aware of proper API deprecation strategies? The sunset period is half a year in most cases... I know this is not entirely an API, but it should be treated like one since they surely know it's used in 3rd party apps that actually simplify life for people who purchase multiple accounts and can purchase even more accounts potentially.
---
Kind of glad this whole power user, trading post abuser, key farming multi-account crap needs to die out. If normal users have to resort to abusing systems so we can keep up with farmers than Anet has failed us. 
---
OMG wig can u also explain what causes it to bug please 
---
precision is irrelevant on guard with radiance since you'll be at or near the crit cap at nearly all times without investing into any precision at all.
---
I wish for a toggle that just hides infusions. I don't want to hide mogs because then it would hide the legit, nice looking ones too.   
---
 These infusions are an eyesore and look terrible.. I've never seen anybody make them look good
---
There are multiple types of fireworks , shop around
---
I'd rather those solo players get better/soloing builds or use the community features than Anet making the content even easier
---
&gt; "know the risk" doesn't mean "it's safe"
---
There is very few ways of doing this securely. Keyloggers, reading the login dat file, and so on. Only thing I can think of at the moment is asking for password on a secure screen, and use that to get a token valid for X time and tied to your ISP's subnets. Or a hardware key.
---
Of course, 2fa is a good fallback that works just as well if password is in a text file or read from keyboard directly.
---
They always spike, and they will fall again. Just sit it out. ANet provides the market, but the prices are made by the players - and this was really easy to predict.
---
They are cheap together and you 100% won't regret it. Gliding and mounts are amazing but gameplay wise the elite specs/runes/stats are important to have
---
Can we talk about the criminal lack new decorations?
---
Thanks. I was considering to buy another 25 keys since people said it usually took 25-50 keys but you just convienced me to not spending any more.
---
The exotic back item is +power, +healing power, + condition damage, + precision but the ascended back piece after the collection is stat selectable.
---
My guess would be something with the new instabilities.
---
Will this also fix the invisible problem in WvW that we had for years now? Were it starts with npc enemies and friendly goes invisible. Then your weapon goes invisible, then you go invisible. Then waypointing takes about 5 min and if you did not give up by then you can not jump and this is were you have to give up and relog since you have to be able to jump in WvW.
---
You can ofc relog faster but mostly there is a very long queue so it is not something you do easy. 
---
Some reasons to this issue is you being moad by enemies, using Tornado skill or Rampage. Some tonics can also instantly make you invisible. This are more complicated though because sometimes it does and sometimes not. And i have not yet figured out why that is.
---
na i pull stunts like that all the time

---
Yup, he's getting mad over not reading how to get the achievement.
---
It's not about the AP, it's about sinking all the luck you have after capping account MF.
---
Rest in peace, hydra-wurm
---
What a baffling perspective. The entire story and open world is completely tailored to solo play, how on earth could you not see it as such?
---
This. If I could dump a stack at a time, sure. One by one? Not worth it.
---
Also, there's ecto gambling. Yes, it feeds gambling issues, and it my opinion games shouldn't feature gambling. Also, I believe gambling shouldn't even be legal in real life. It is very addictive and it has destroyed lives.
---
What do I know about bloodstones? I'm a boxing promoter.
---
In the last line, don't use "runas.exe" if you don't need it. I use that to run multiple boxes, each with a different windows account. You can just directly start 
---
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Guild Wars 2 - B\Gw2-64.exe
---
I'll just tell what ya to do. Real simple
---
For each account you have, do this:
---
1. Open your `Appdata\Roaming\Guild Wars 2\` folder; it will have a `Local.dat` file in it. *Every time you log on, it regenerates, saving that specific account's log-in details.*
---
2. Log-on; stay on loading screen for a few seconds
---
3. Log-off
---
4. Copy+paste the `Local.dat` somewhere. I made subfolder directory just to make things neat, but it doesn't matter where you put them. I put them here: `AppData\Roaming\Guild Wars 2\GW2Launcher\ACCOUNTNAME.####`; one folder for each dat.
---
5. Download GW2Launcher
---
From here, it is pretty self-explanatory. The app is easy to use and the rest should be intuitive, however, if you have any further questions, feel free to ask. 
---
While I agree they need to either do expansions or more with living story I have hope they will do more with story.
---
They said they have the tools &amp; manpower to do so now, so they should put them to work.
---
Do they not have red paint where you're from, OP?
---
No shit sherlock, what do you think, that I chose the name randomly?
---
Don't call my method horrible if you don't understand it.
---
This method is 1 windows account per game client. Do you run 37 accounts at once ?
---
If you use several different gw2 accounts on the same gw2 client (=windows account), use my method with the local.dat files. I described or linked it several times in other comments.
---
Try again, I dont understand idiot
---
Pack is still better on classes like Holo and Herald that have perma swiftness
---
That precision is bae
---
[Who needs chairs?](https://zippy.gfycat.com/FrequentGaseousHeterodontosaurus.webm)

I'm kinda sad the Shrine Guardian mount isn't back, since I missed that the first time. But the outfit is super cute!
---
"Edit: 20 minutes to go through 4 stacks of exotic lucks which comes out to 42g an hour if you have the luck and continuously hit F and click the spot to donate an exotic luck. I kind of hope that anet adds an option to turn in more than one essence at a time."
---
Even at 140g/hr I would still not do it. Far, far, faaaaaaaar too boring and tedious. FFS Anet, couldn't you just get 1 thing right from the first try? It's obvious this is poor usability. Just like it was obvious salvaging Bloodstone Rubies was poor usability. So do we expect "feed him 1 stack at a time" option by 2021?

Thanks! All done in Photoshop (:

This doesn't really belong on this sub tbh. Everybody and their grandma knows WoW is shit atm
---
Well, I wouldn't call WoW utter garbage. It appeals to a different audience, and wouldn't have been so successful all these years without nothing to sell for.
---
WoW is not GW2 and GW2 is not WoW. And indeed, GW2 has a good focus on open world content.
---
Lol, I understand it, not really hard to understand. Wasn’t trying to be a jerk, but it really is horrible when you consider the fact that you are spinning up a large handful of accounts, bloating your user folder, and adding unnecessary overhead. 
---
I assume you’re doing so because the client looks in the documents folder for the local.dat file? But as I mentioned, you can just symlink it and get the same results.
---
I’m not telling you what to do, do whatever you like. To each their own. But in the same way that batch files for renaming and such are hackey, your method is both hackey and frankly horrible. 
---
Wow this is amazing.
---
Also im the only noob who does not know how to "up" again after using the griff power?
---
good job in not knowing shit....
---
Unrelated, but I love your username, even if it only works for German speakers. Great pun, 10/10

I just do the first heart daily with all alts. Equally quick on mount. And garntee 5 instead of rng

Sinkwars 2
---
Oh right, Xadaganian Paladins were Commissars. 
---
i think OP is more referring to blizzard's recent decisions which a large part of wow's community dislikes.
---
Yes, that you bring this as an argument shows exactly how deep you are vested in this idiotic line of argument. And how pathetic it really is. So desperate to feel superior.
---
Didnt know massage devices have screens now
---
There will always be a "best". That's in the nature of things. Perfect balance is impossible. One will always be best. And people will flock to it. Same as with class balance.
---
Breaking that up is the point. You suggested to put in a lot of effort so the "Meta" changes regularly. Just adding a bonus to achieves the exact same thing without eating up a lot of resources better spent on creating content.
---
in your keybinds under mounts there is mount ability 1 and 2  (mount ability 1 is not swoop btw)   mount ability 1 is dive mount ability 2 is your pull up.  if you have the mastery's for griffon using a flap while diving will give you a speed boost of which you can cruise around the map when let go of the dive. then use flaps to maintain your current height with some degradation. that's the basics on how to use the griffon
---
if you are anyone else wants to learn how to fly the griffon ingame feel free to message me at chaos.3579  \^\_\_\^
---
Im sorry but this feature supported bots far more than normal player, i dunno how this can affect u or any normal player in any way ?
---
yea i friended some bots to avoid in pvp.   hehe
---
Woah there buddy, I'm guessing you have a phone?
---
ArcDPS. Its ToS compliant, and its fairly easy to install (literally just adding or removing the downloaded .dll file from your bin64 folder wherever you installed GW2) but weighty enough to be able to see boon breakdown, how much damage each skill did (clicking on your name in the meter brings this window up), and starts when GW2 runs (as an overlay) and not like meters like ACT for FFXIV where you'd need to do weird modding of files and run the exe every time you wanted to parse.
---
very late but having 3/day or even 1/day means people wont have a reason to farm the meta either if they can just buy them
---
Sorry making excuses for Anet isn't enough. 
---
How the fuck do you go through life with so little self awareness lmao
---
[Arcdps](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/) is one of the few addons you can use. It does tend to break after every new patch which might cause crashes, so you have to keep it always manually updated.
---
What are the top dog classes in fracs now? Raids?
---
&gt; literally touching the ground 
---
Watched it in x0.25 speed and he definitely did not touch the ground.
---
but it's still completely doable and (specifically) allowed in the ToS, just more inconvenient.
---
Preaching to the choir my friend. LBs central feature is dead in the water, and no elegant solution is currently available. 
---
Vote with your wallets. 
---
You will get lower power from Marauder in exchange for precision.
---
Zerk armor with Valk trinkets and weapons give 20% crit chance. With 50% from Righteous Instincts, 10% from Radiance Grandmaster Minor and 20% from Fury you get 100% crit chance. To upkeep Fury and Retal he would probably need Stand Your Ground and Feel my Wrath, but they are rather good on solo play anyway.
---
In his defence tho there is no challenge that forces you to learn what your class does in terms of boons/condis and defensives. It's only dps dps dodge dps from 1 to 80.   
---
 But starting eithe HoT or PoF could whoop their ass so they will be forced to take a look at their kit.   
---
 Imo the biggest problem is 80 lvls of nothing, I said it was retarded for gw2 to have 80lvls at the start and I still think it now, useless bloat. A lvl squish would be a good change if they're not planning to overhaul the vanilla experience.  
---
 And we all know it fucking needs it, many new players quit because it's boring af. It's sad when you have to tell newbies in starting zones "It gets better, I promise! Just trust me bro! There are dungeons, just not these ones the good ones are called differently! Your class can do XYZ and the thing you thought your class naturally did is actually dogshit and better on this completely disconnected class!"  
---
 Something needs to change to get in more people and the vanilla game is a very very poor selling point. 
---
We're spoiled beyond belief, yes.
---
Yea I didn't realize that trait gave +50 crit chance
---
WoW is still percepted as "successfull" just because people playing it can't stop, nor they know about alternatives. They have subscription paid, so they don't want to invest more money to different games, and they don't want to lose the time (and thus make their sub wasted) as well. 
---
They are basically trapped. They invested so much already, that leaving all of that behind is extremely painful so they don't do it and keep grinding...
---
Thats what I said. They are not fully ranged weapons like Longbow.
---
I haven't faced this issue yet. I kept them so I would have 777 exotic for the guild hall.
---
Ok ok you too:-P
---
Don't comment on topics you clearly don't understand
---
Ideal thanks 
---
Pretty much yea you have to type your credentials each time

You sir, are a rabble rouser!
---
It's back to 5 silver a piece now and it's abundant.

If you have any statuettes left, I used my statuettes to buy a Golden Key and got it first try. May have just been lucky, but worth a try if you don't want anything else from statuettes!
---
It's not an exploit as long as the person utilizing all accounts is following these rules: https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/65546/policy-dual-or-multi-boxing/
---
My run took same path u dis . The thing i admire the most here , due to terrible mechanic of picking flag i personally gave up after many fails where i fly trough flag and not getting it. Impressive run but i bet came with cost to ur nervs :).
---
Someone decided to speak before they read. 
---
Since you didn't bother to make a quote, I assume you can't grasp the very idea that some people don't praise paintovers, half-backed sketches and choyas with click bait titles "my 5 y old daughter made this" (spoiler: she didn't). Noted!
---
Really good change. Anet listens!  
---
^^^^SoundsLikeMountRacesAreUnaffected.
---
I dunno, I haven't really thought it through it just feels wrong to me
---
You should also know about sites like [DPS Report](https://dps.report/) and [GW2 Raidar](https://www.gw2raidar.com/info-help) for uploading your logs. Can get very detailed break downs and comparisons to others if you want. Just need to turn on logging in Arc and the logs will show up in:
---
    Documents\Guild Wars 2\addons\arcdps\arcdps.cbtlogs    
---
gw2launcher is inelegant compared, but i was able to launch 5 clients at once with it, all autologin (the app copies the dat file for you) but the launcher still appears for each.
---
fuck A-Net why did they remove those arguments???????????
---
how am i now supposed to manage my 3 Accounts god fucking hell ......
---
What? What happened?
---
Rofl...I really missed Launchbuddy =(
---
if you are discouraged to get your log in rewards just because you now have to type your login credentials for alt accounts, maybe you didnt deserve the login reward in the first place.
---
and everyone using those should know how "insecure" they are, but i rather have my password "inscruely" stored on my pc then have to re enter credentials 3 times over and over again!!!!!
---
Guildwars 2 is a game. For everyone older than 14. I'd argue that most don't consider internet security when creating a shortcut for a game.
---
In a perfect world everyone would think about every detail, but we don't live in a perfect world. This change might sacrifice your, and some others, convenience, but it would protect a hundred times more people from making a mistake.
---
At some point everyone has to deal with their mistakes, but we don't need to offer them ways to make more mistakes.
---
Then patch the hole with something that's just as convenient and still solves the problem.  Don't just straight up remove a feature a fair few people rely on and then give them basically nothing to work with.
---
So...what if the way we end the Kralk story is if we trap him in the mists? If we found a way to prevent him from traveling in and out of the mists, and maybe we even kill him in the mists...that would provide some interesting new plotlines as his magic is spread throughout the mists and empowers new foes...while leaving mainland Tyria free of his particular wrath
---
Identifying gear, 1.5k a day @925 mf
---
As mentioned before, there are still [scripts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aiqee4/anet_disabled_auto_login/eeprtzk/) for this case. They still make it possible, they only removed the unsafe feature. It might be slightly less convenient to setup, but just as easy to use.
---
PvP or WvW reward tracks are a much better source. If one plays these modes that is.
---
Wait till it’s daily event and you will have all the meta event in the world ^^
---
But would it be wise to sink all of them? What if some new stuff arrives? 
---
I mean, they actually had balls to put at least this sink there.
---
Most who feel that way have misconceptions about what happens. 
---
Literally the act of multiboxing through a tool like LaunchBuddy is akin to having 2+ computers running Gw2 at the same time. There’s no other benefit so long as you follow the ToS. 
---
I never do infinite farm.. just spend a max of 3 hour in istan and do other contents too
---
Wow i will check in home. I tryied several times doing some courses (from istan for example) and all my results is crashing in the watter lol.
---
Definitly im going to check the keybind menu. 
---
Thanks!
---
Or, maybe, have legendary stufc mean something, since once you have a full legendary character, no more gear drops interest you
---
Links to those "Alternatives" please?
---
maybe you shouldn't be exploiting the log-in rewards anyway?
---
At current exchange rate of around 130 gold for 400 gems it comes out at 65 days of just doing Tequatl for the guaranteed 2 gold a day to pay for it. 
---
I mainly recommend it for convenience though, you don't have to have TAC0 or a world boss timer window up and you don't have to worry about missing one you want that day because it gives you a ten minute warning in chat. 
---
Yeah, u/TheCheatsrichter and I had a quick discussion earlier, and the local.dat option is an inelegant solution. If it’s the only option left, that may be where we head. But there are other options being looked into. 
---
I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to give the user options, but there are just too many downsides to that method. 
---
PvE player spotted.
---
my theory for s4e06 is that it's actually going to be s5e01
---
To decrease RNG we should be able to buy 1 item of our choice for statuettes.
---
It sure will take a looong time to get full legendary trinkets. Making mist trinkets be upgradeable with all the regular items like clovers and stuff would be nice.
---
I don't want to know how a character with 6 legendary trinkets looks like.
---
Hey OP, what do you get from being top 1, except the gold chest and your name on top of the leaderboard. Did you get any achievement or a reward?
---
By PvE I'd assume raids/fracs in which case the shared fury from pack rune as well as might is way better then the personal gain of vigor which is provided by sun spirit anyways.
---
Note: Firework rune is only for urself whereas pack rune is for allies also.
---
LOL, why would they need to justify it in a gamemode that is a joke as a competition and where "winning" is considered meaningless by anyone who isn't either new or a bit "special"?
---
I have no experience with ESO, but I do know that in most cases mechanical skill will transfer over, i.e. if you're mentally good with memorizing rotations and physically doing them. However, situational skill, game mechanics and game knowledge does not transfer over most times. Actually doing your rotation while also doing raid mechanics, understanding how to fill gaps in your rotation etc, is all stuff that you will have to relearn to one extent or another. 
---
That said, the only way to know how "hard" it is, is to get into the Aerodome and try rotations. Pull up the class you want to play on snowcrows, in your case probably [power chrono](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/). Scroll to the Rotation section at the bottom, and familiarize yourself with the written rotation. Then go into the Aerodome, into the Special Forces Training Area (You'll need to create a squad to get in).
---
Now you'll want to take a look at the [Benchmarks Page](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) and click on the Buffs icon to figure out what buffs you need to apply. As a newbie who probably doesn't have the full gear ascended gear w/ food and infusions, 25k would be a good number to shoot for. If you have all the right gear and such, 30k+ is really where you want to be, or as close to the numbers they have listed for your class in the Golem tab.
---
Not sure how it’s an exploit, it’s literally part of the game. And the accounts are paid for before anything else can happen with those rewards so...
---
&gt;"If you're thinking about game dev as a career, don't."
---
I also (sort of) do something like this for a living, I use all the tools I'd use for regular game dev, but aside from the love for making games there really isn't a whole lot the games industry itself has to offer - it's incredibly volatile so if you're looking for a stable job: good luck (also heavily depends on the studio/games you work on and where you are located)
---
-email and -password were removed from the game. This leads to LaunchBuddy and likely other apps being unable to log people directly into their account. As well as user created shortcuts to do the same. 
---
Holy crap that mount looks fun.
---
you mean 9 sets of armour and trinkets as well as dozens of weapons. 
---
besides that, if grinding for gear drops is all you care about, gw2 really isn't a long-term game for you, games that constantly raise max level and invalidate previous gear might be more fun for you. 
---
many players don't care much about legendary skins but rather the convenience of not having to lug around an average of 18.5 items per build (some only need 17, some 20 due to weapons). 
---
The explanation to save as many accounts as you want is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aiqee4/anet_disabled_auto_login/eer96fe/?context=2) . Note that, as others said, my method with "copy" is not necessarily the best one (replace with move or symlinks). The explanation to run several accounts is quickly explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aismaj/launchbuddy_official_statement_regarding_the/eeq9sml/), but would deserve to be more detailed. Thought it's not new, it's a method that has been posted on this reddit for years, so you can probably find a comprehensive guide to it.
---
Oh thanks, this dulfys guide looks pretty nice, will definetly read it
---
Ill give it a shot, thanks 
---
Well it is red but it doesn't quite look like bloodstone. No particles flying around, no different shades of red. It is just red :P 
---
No... you've got to get both pieces from the meta and the trading post and use them to get the buff at the beginning of the puzzle. 
---
What is this key farm you speak off? 
---
Is it a way for them to limit players to one account on the future. Warframe has that going for it.
---
&gt; It takes quite a bit of time though for the Meta to change
---
You're not listening, the whole point is to break the meta. Keep people in a constant state of discovery - keep the game feeling new. 
---
There will always be those that will only follow a meta, however weak it is, but those people likely will be following the most apparent potential presented by the hardcore farmers - and the entire point is to keep that flowing. Keep that flowing and you keep the game flowing. 
---
A gold bonus is static, it's very obviously unnatural. People pick up on that sort of thing, they know they're being corralled from X meta one week to X meta the next week and that affects enjoyment. The game still feels static and unchanging, the players are just moving from one pen to the next. 
---
&gt; Since you can very specifically set the additional rewards.
---
Which would require someone to work out what rewards to set, and that loss of resource is exactly what you're saying the main issue is. 
---
You need to spend resources to keep your game going strong - spending it on maintaining a natural feeling gameplay flow is one of the most efficient things you can do and it keeps the game feeling fresh despite its age. It's exactly how games like Dota and Path of Exile keep themselves fresh despite their age.

Please in the context of GW2 how is that exploiting,.

Does exiting combat reset the ICD?

Are you serioues? Scourge is extremely powerful in WvW and balanced in PvP.

LOL I got mine when it was a mere few silver..
---
"To discourage people with multiple accounts to get their log in rewards" is speculation in its best case. I'm solely talking about the difference of having to circle through a dozen windows remembering and entering all login credentials instead of just having them all open at once, automatically. 5 seconds my ass.
---
What's a weekend post doing here... Has someone got confused what day it is haha
---
Seriously you are an adult and allowed to gamble... I don't consider gw2 lootboxes as gamble but even since you do I just want to point out one thing. This new rule they try to introduce is not about you at all. 
---
As a snipped from an article. This is why they are considering changing the law and besides Belgium both US and UK have voted against it since the line for gambling is clear for most people. Real world valuable to real world valuable, not the case in gw2.
---
"Belgium's Minister of Justice, Koen Geens, was keen to focus on how **children** are confronted with loot boxes, calling the mix of gaming and gambling "dangerous for mental health".
---
This might lead to lootboxes being banned from games. The only way of keeping lootboxes if this law adjustment passes is rating the game age 18 or age 21 and including the parts for gambling. Definitly possible but depending on where the money sits for gw2 unlucrativ since you have to forbit it for kids.
---
However your problem is entirely yours your lack of self control might benefit from the outcome but this is not about you. If you could stop blaming the company and rather seek help if you can't control yourself would probably benefit you most. 
---
Iirc this worked for the entire history of GW1 as well so almost 14 years.
---
*it probably still works for GW1 but don't tell anet*
---
Sort of? A lot of timer/map websites that connect to the API are able to see “tomorrow’s” dailies so you can get a heads up but to my knowledge they can’t see any further.
---
Creating multiple accounts for the sole purpose getting daily benefits multiple times over
---
I have a f2p alt account just to be able to farm pvp dailies in custom arenas - so I don't have to wait until another player happens to be in the arena too.
---
This looks fun as fuck 
---
I use keepass at work every day and at home every day. Global auto-type is Ctrl-Alt-A
---
You can farm pvp dailies in custom arenas without having to wait for other players to join. At least that's what I use my f2p alt for.
---
A feature such as this might actually start to make a dent in my city-sized hoard of transmutation charges too.
---
If it's succesful enough, the gem store sale of charges could even increase, meaning more money for Anet, so it's a win-win (depending on dev time and cost, of course.)
---
That's what I've been using, but it froze with a white screen after the patch yesterday. Do I need to delete my profiles and recreate them?
---
i managed to escape ANY spoilers until i finished the story today. just closed the game right after THAT event. you made it worse. great work.  now im crying over pixels. 
---
Yeah, it works, but you have to manually login for each account.
---
I'm using 1.8.2 currently with mine.  Which has 4 blank accounts added on the list without any email or password added to them.  With their own GFX Settings and command arguments.  I select all 4 and hit Launch and they begin to load 1 client at a time, until I have 4 gw2 launchers ready to login.
---
Bursty builds have big advantage and they include (all power) weaver, tempest, soulbeast, dh. Considering that majority of groups can't phase bosses very quickly, holo, DE, DD and condi FB are also very strong options.
---
Thank you!
---
The new Rockcrusher mace still has it's skin locked, with no option to add it to wardrobe.
---
i feel like istan i pretty balanced with this recent nerf (someone correct me if im wrong)
---
thats 5g worth of unid gear, disregarding all the other loot. How long does the pala meta take?
---
Probably should have posted a picture after opening the 21 champ bags as well.
---
Whats th 59 items in the bottom left corner?
---
Will check both out, thank you. I just liked the idea of being a sniper in an MMO. 
---
So much for this 'buff'... from your screens the loot has been nerfed too. previously hitting all champs + getting all chests = 20 Pala bags + 1-2k VM (uni gear seems about the same). But im not sure if u hit all champs etc, ah well will have to try it later i guess and see\^
---
Yep that works for me too but my concern is about instance manager I can't play without it:-)
---
It won't invalidate anything, it'll just make legendary stuff more available to different game modes. All sets of legendary armor costs about the same, you know.
---
I'm with the other guy that says get a comm tag or an apple tag at least. Pop it up for like a minute and Bammm! You're not alone, yes you are soloing still in an mmo, partyless.
---
My main reason of soloing to share some sentiment is that I spend too much time concerning myself to what the other player wants to do when when I'm playing by myself I can focus the grind and laundry list of dailies or tp flipping
---
Its personal buffs only and the movement speed is completely wasted. So no. If you do run anything but scholar stick to Pack.

What do you even get for donating food beside an achievement? I dont think the food was that much useless that they had to make a sink this big. The food is allrdy really overpriced.
---
Date selfie bro is me
---
The Karma Item from enrichment. 
---
ALso yes I understand the sentiment, but as someone who ran this about 1-2 times a day it is a direct loss in just the VM value than what it was before. They said that the items in the chests were going to be more profitable than they were before if you only ran it once a day. Well that is not seeming the case. I will try to test again tomorrow if I can get a group together to do it.
---
That would be interesting. Not sure about the heavy to light idea, but being able to use saved Fashion Wardrobes onto other compatible characters would be cool!
---
Top class in PvP, top class in WvW, top class in open world PvE, above average in fractals, average in raids, less than average in raid speedclears. Yeah, such a poor class. /s
---
If you wanna join the bandwagon: AG and RoS. Otherwise it's pretty much just Kodash (which is german).
---
WSR has been very strong for a long while and other servers just don't bring much action and/or quality. Wvw is turning into pve simulation. 
---
And you claimed that it's not a big deal because it's measly five seconds that don't matter. Which I call bullshit on. Logging a dozen accounts in by hand and typing is incomparable to Launchbuddy's convenience.
---
Perhaps I figured there was some element of RNG to it, but still the statement in the patch notes is seemingly false. I only got 644 VM where I normally would get 1200ish. VM is the real money maker. The UnID'd I am not shaking my fist at, it is just less than 1 run of what I got just yesterday.
---
Can't you have multiple machines, or run several instances of GW2 on one machine, though?
---
Even if your roof has been leaking for the last ten years, you should still get it fixed. 
---
The real problem here isn't that they 'fixed' a security flaw, it's that they haven't offered any alternatives to people who depended upon it working this way. 
---
If you could call disabled command line prompts a 'fix', anyway.
---
Elaborate
---
How could someone take over her acc thru support tickets?
---
I hit as many champs as I could, bear in mind this is a late-night NA run at around 4:45 am my time, where there was hardly ever more than a full squad of 50 to begin with. So those of us that played this time probably experienced less loot anyway compared to those that ran it at more active times. However, I will say the focus of my post was on the chest loot itself. I maybe should have edited my Screen to reflect that.
---
Ha ha ha "revamped" he says
---
Is this that tiny window that lets you click between each game window?  I've learned to use window mode and downsize it to fit all my games on screen at once using a program called Sizer 4.  You can set hotkeys to the program that will automatically resize and position the game window for you once you are loaded.  Of course everything is a lot smaller when doing stuff, but I can at least keep a watch on all of them. It hasn't really hindered me in doing the HoT metas at the same time.
---
Also since I have to sometimes alt tab to check things outside of the game, bringing my 4 accounts back up started to be a pain, so I created an autohotkey script to automatically bring all 4 windows to the front quickly.
---
    SetWinDelay, 1
---
    SetTitleMatchMode, 2       ;// matches partial window titles
---
    Numpad7::                       ;// hotkey
---
    WinActivate, Guild Wars 2    ;// activate window with this title
---
    WinActivateBottom, Guild Wars 2    ;// activates window older than the last with this title
---
    WinActivateBottom, Guild Wars 2    
---
    return
---
This script should fine to use, as bringing some windows to the foreground doesn't actually give you an advantage in game from someone else.
---
What Griffin skin is that and what dyes did you use? I love how it looks!

Except that getting raid legendary armoir is far more difficult than getting either the pvp or the wvw one. The same would be the case for trinkets, since you would skip having to do all the story achievement metas.

---
Ugh no, the class ranger can be both ranged or melee that is not the point. It can be either, in gw2 too it can be either.
---
Anet clearly does not see ranger as a ranged class. But that is still not the point. Try to breath and read and understand:
---
Ranger in guild wars could have ONLY melee or ONLY ranged weapons and the name Ranger would still fit. Because of their ties with nature and animals etc. This is what ranger means in fantasy worlds. Skills like "heal as one" with your pet, using spirits of nature and such what makes the ranger a "ranger" class.
---
What i say has **nothing** to do with what is meta in game, what build is good and what build is bad. You guys just don't know what range in ranger means and so you don't know what ranger means and that is okay but what is not okay is that you try to justify this lack of knowledge by some bullshit like this. 
---

---
I hope so, at least a bit. But yeah. I'm not terribly concerned in the grand scheme of things I think my ultimate goal is that I want to still continue to get to DO this event 'daily' like they suggest was their goal with the change. But, since my play time is in very off peak hours (3:45 am PST), It was already a chance that you may not get enough people to make it worth doing which sucks for someone like me who enjoyed leading and running this event. Short of farming it Pala/GH is actually REALLY fun for me.
---
If people are stupid enough to throw large sums of money at a rng chance at a skin they actually want then they aren't going anywhere. 
---
Yes, and waiting for a single instance to load up, remembering and typing in your login data, starting the client and waiting for it to load up takes significantly more time than selecting all your accounts and just booting them up.
---
Don’t you need to be like rank 2000 to get the WvW armor? That’s a much MUCH longer time investment then LI.
---
Forgot to mention, for each additional game you run. I think you said you run 5?  You would need to have 4 lines with WinActivateBottom so it first loads 1 window, then it proceeds to bring the other games forward 1 at a time quickly.  If you start to see problems with them coming forward try adjusting the setwindelay to 2.  Also do be warned this also brings up windows that match the text "Guild Wars 2" including folders or other things with the same name (including chrome windows).
---
i only really grokked how to do it during the festival of the four winds when trying to do the master course.

Hey, I know this is might sound dumb, but how do I get this code to run?

It's encrypted because it uses the original untouched file  encrypted by ANET itself. 
---
Its a good change. :) 
---
I don't wanna play in small windows:-P
---
"Ugh no", I'm saying that *Anet sees Ranger as a ranged class*. You cannot convince me Anet thinks Ranger is a melee class when they have so many descriptions calling them the 'master of ranged' or something like that. What Anet sees it as has *nothing to do with what you see it as.*
---
Its not really what you will expect. I feel it's not feel made for open world. But always worth unlocking all specialization
---
I wish i was, but its EU here :/ But thanks for the offer :) 
---
or chrono.
---
There might be another way if you can actually rename the gw2 client window, and use a script set to a hotkey for each window.  Like say Alt + 1-5 for each game window, and it would use a similar method to the script I had posted, but each client would have their own Hotkey set to them, so it would bring that game to the front.  Much like how the GUI on LB works, except with keyboard shortcuts.
---
My favourite is the War God scepter that looks like a flail. Use it for my death knight style necro.
---
Of course. I'm not so much asking the question as genuine confusion or inquiry, I asked the question to draw attention to the fact that they choose to sell some items one way and and other items in BLCs.  
---
You're totally right in that they are made to take advantage of the human mind and those that may be weak willed.
---
As I mentioned in an earlier post, I don't think Arenanet or any business is absolved of any guilt whatsoever when they intentionally go out of their way to make a product as addicting as possible at any cost.
---
I understand why they do it, but I don't believe that makes it okay. I won't try to deny that some level of responsibility falls on the consumer for making the decision to buy the item or service in the first place, but this is why various countries and states are now asking that companies change this practice.
---
You want to sell people games of chance? All right fine, but you do it on our terms. I.e. You have to list the percentage chance of said item appearing.
---
Just me, Or she gonna become like an exalted? Putting her soul on a golem.

no worries, yea even with the chest loot - VM seems wayyyy lower, pre-patch was easily 1k+ vm with personally getting between 20-40vm per chest
---
He has to pay for all previously released Living Stories, but I think there are season bundles(ls2,ls3,ls4) at a discount.
---
The ugh no is that you are thinking i am commenting on if ranger in this game is ranged or melee.
---
Comment i replied to:
---
&gt;For god's sake the name of the class is RANGER..
---
Clearly thinks that "ranger" as a name means "distance"r which is factually false. Something can both be right (Anet could think ranger is ranged in their game) and wrong (that the name ranger suggests a class is supposed to be ranged).
---
So yea, ugh no. You are too focused on something that i am not talking about. I don't give a fuck if ranger is ranged or melee or what people think of the class in this game. I however care when people spread false information that "ranger" supposedly mean someone that combats from a distance.
---
I am sure you understand me, so not sure why you are being stubborn.
---
Braa
---
Chest Contents was the only thing mentioned in the changes. That is what my post is about. Just the chest contents. There did not seem to be much improvement at all. Replacing 25+ VM with 1 Green item is not an improvement.
---
I've been part of the research on both.
---
With akili bugged, istan was 21/22 gph for a single map rotation, and when he worked it was 24-26 gph. You can go higher if there's enough maps to jump between GH events, but that's not consistently possible (especially on EU, there aren't that many idle istan maps).
---
Riba climbed back up to 28 gph over the past several months because the expensive drops got more expensive due to less people running riba.
---
i wonder what your definition of farming is.
---
Is it doing the same content multiple times per log in as long as it gives good rewards?
---
Should that content be enganging, so its fun to play or you rather auto-attack while watching netflix on the side?
---
I didn't hear you make an actual point yet. Mad cus bad.

OP I run this in WVW, and it turns out that it's really effective in PVE as well.  Not fancy, not meta, but easy to live with:
---

---
I just got rid of the Traveler Runes for the new Firework runes, for a nice DPS increase.  Also Bane signet is better for PVE than Judgment, but you might prefer the damage reduction and extra stun break.
---
The trick is that you use your healing skill offensively, and take advantage of your melee AOE's (hammer) and ranged AOE's (scepter) to augment your damage from attacks.  You use JI to get into the midst of the highest concentration of enemies, activate Litany, and beat the tar out of everything you can for the next 6 seconds.  In almost every case you will outheal any damage you take.  Optionally you can save Litany for when your health actually gets low, since it's a triple heal when traited.  But I prefer using RF for my "oh shit" skill.  In PVE I seldom need it, and Feel my Wrath is probably a better choice.
---
I'm far from a "good" player but I can take on just about any non-Champ enemies (and solo certain Champs) with this in HOT or POF.  You just have to learn its ins and outs, but that's the truth for any build you commit yourself to.
---
Yes you have to pay for every season. Now IIRC, you could buy the whole season for a cheaper price. I think season 2 would cost 500gems instead of the 800 you would need to unlock each episode separately.
---
Actually, they recommend getting BD from as much diviner and AR you can get together.
---
[I believe this would be better for PvE](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vJAQNBiSDbknD68waPw7DoDxQVQlvQXnCaP0C5AuAXQAA-jxBCQB37iA4VlfjVJIAeCAWZ/Bqq+jS1NQKA/mZB-e)

Or just. maybe, remember what your password is and type it in.  It's not like you have to retype it a hundred times a day.

Sadly it has been a pve simulational for a while ;)

Outside of guild raids and maybe resets all you do is run around and hold 1

Looks like reporting something actually does have Anet initiate a fix.

Tequatl was just zhaitans champion just like the claw of jormag and the shatterer, his rising was with anets words: "The magic used to create Tequatl is no longer being controlled by Zhaitan, but it still exists within Tequatl. Therefore, like many uncontrolled magics, it is experiencing an evolution and it is shaping itself" so he did not get more magic, his own magic just changed. 
---
and the only way of glint to become an elder dragon would have been to absorb kralkatorikks enormous amount of magic. She herself was nothing more than kralkatorikks strongest champion and got only the magic that kralkatorikk gave her, just like every other dragon champion

I understand that multiboxing is behind many of the currently used exploits that are crippling the in-game economy, and any steps ANet can take to stop that from happening I welcome with open arms.
---
It's easy to say that multiboxing is okay as long as the ToS are followed, but for every person out there following the ToS, there's probably at least one exploiting the game's systems
---
Very unpopular indeed
---
The profit isn’t from the luck, it’s from the materials salvaging.  This new luck-for-gold is just a cherry by comparison.
---
Good, no more multiboxing.

I'd like to see some lesser-known maps used for other content, too.
---
(Ruby) As far as playing with others around - is it more about the other players or the complex mechanics that often fail without enough of them who know what they're doing? I'm a loner player too and I use the Event Timer page on the wiki to see what larger-scale events are up, and lfg to find squads attempting them. Most of those encounters end successfully.
---
There's also daily achievements, LS map dailies, jumping puzzles and some (not all) dungeon paths if you'd really rather stay completely solo. There are a lot of champions that can be fought solo with practice and a strong build, such as some of the bosses in Kessex Hills, but I don't know of a list of them.

No you have to turn off log in to character select, basically the patch made it so that you have to go via the patch client in order to start the game.

I love GW2 and is the better MMO atm IMO, mostly thanks to the business model. However is kinda counter productive comparing open world in a game like Gw2 (mostly oriented for casuals) with WoW where is mostly around dungeon/raid grind. 
---
People who love raids are craving for faster raid releases here in Gw2. When we do get a raid, there is no way of knowing if its gonna be piss easy like W4 or semi-hard like W5. Any meaningful experience with raids (cms for instance) are only rewarded once. 
---
Different scenarios for different needs. 
---
I think this is what people are missing. Gw2 has always had the better art team and the micro stories have been better too. You always cared about your character and the world you were in. WoW focused on different things while occasionaly they have had a good overarching story, it is rare. They focus on pve and pvp content. Their mythic plus is more competitive than franctals and their raids see more focus than gw2 raids.
---
They are two distinct game with two very distinct focuses.
---
OPs post is comparing open world wow (where it is historically weak) to open world gw2 (where it is historically strong). It is simplistic and nonsensical to make such a narrow comparison. Look wow has taken a nose dive with bfa and gw2 does have its problems but what they offer are comepletly different.

Firecracker lightning very very frightning ME!
---
welcome to the age of microtransactions
---
It's not super fetch-questy if that's what you're asking. It's more about exploring and doing events. The heart "quests" can feel a bit boring, but they really were originally meant to act as a hub for events. That is to say that events happen nearby the hearts, and players doing the hearts would see them and participate. You can purely do exploration and events and ignore the hearts and it won't slow down your levelling experience at all. It is also free to play, so it won't hurt to check it out. I hope you have fun and enjoy the game.
---
How much for it?
---
As a somewhat regular player of WoW until WotLK and loyal GW2 player since it's launch, here is my take on why WoW is getting worse and GW2 keeps getting better and better (so far).
---
WoW forgot it's key values. It was never intended to be this approachable, easy to access game. It was at it's core a game for dedicated players first. Which is why when WotLK came about and started "sacrificing core WoW values at the altar of accessibility", it stopped being it's own game, instead following whatever trends it deemed worthy.
---
Now let's look at Guild Wars 2, the polar opposite of WoW when it comes to core values of accessibility and required player dedication. From Launch up until the latest episode, GW2 stayed true to it's original values. Changing them around based on what they learned while the game is live, sure... but not discarding them completely. Sure, we do have Fractals and Raids, but even then Fractals are designed in a way so that everyone can play them at their own skill level, and it's only Raids that require some level of player dedication comparable to a game like WoW used to require.
---
You can upgrade the standard WvW ascended armor to legendary. You will still need to play WvW and cap the tickets for 21 weeks to get a full set of armor, while raids will only be 10 weeks of capping LI. Finding groups and learning raids might be harder than getting into WvW (or PvP). Even with starting off with training raids and not be able to get full clears in the beginning I am sure most people will be able to get that raid armor faster than most people would get the WvW armor if they started at the same time.
---
just do map completion, you get loads.
---
Some wow writers wrote fan fic before working there too. This doesn’t mean they are bad, you have to get your start elsewhere.
---
I feel like with enough upgrades a guild hall should end up like the amenity passes (lily of the elon/mistlock sanctuary etc).
---
As you return to the spot you were in when you leave a guild Hall it would be pretty useful.
---
Make it slightly worse than  the ones in the game already, so make them more spread out compared to the premium passes, but less spread out than existing cities.
---
But then some features unique to guild halls could be there too like an omni raid gate (just brings up a dialogue with all the wings to enter), another one for dungeons and another one for fractals. This would encourage guilds to partake in this content more, and the cost for these could be tied to those activities to make it a nice cumulative effort to get it.
---
I feel like the guild Hall should be a hub that competes with the other available hubs, but isn't better in every regard, so they all have something worth getting them for. 
---
If you have to ask, you can't afford it.
---
Nice! I need to fix my bamboo tablet. Im guessing you have a Wacom monitor or something? 
---
Afaik he gets to play on test servers before the episode roles out 
---
It is free... Been free for a while. It launched as buy to play, but became free. Free players do have restrictions that get lifted upon buying an expansion.
---
My thoughts:
---
1) Do we really, really need to be a reddit community where we're absolutely vindictive of any MMO that isn't GW2, and how it seems to be better than any other MMO out there without letting people enjoy what they enjoy?
---
2) I would never call GW2 a masterpiece; I love it, I enjoy it, but there are absolutely a lot of things wrong with the game that hold it back. I think the main story of the game is probably its weakest, paradoxical to how good the environmental storytelling is.
---
3) Akin to point 1 and echoed by others here; design of a sub fee MMO =/= design of a f2p+b2p MMO. Blizz has been having a horrible time of late, but a lot of your points factors more into that.
---
If they spend their time on this but not an new LFG i am gonna kill myself. 
---
&gt; I don't have much sympathy for multiple account holders affected by this and I have 0 sympathy for the Launchbuddy developer.
---
&gt; It fucks with in game economies and playerbase statistics so I understand the change.
---
You are a special kind of idiot. Did anyone ever tell you that?
---
Do you actually think this action was taken because of any of that and to discourage people owning multiple accounts?
---
Do you actually think this will stop those people from using their multiple accounts?
---
Are you actually this stupid, or is this a really bad troll...where you make fun of yourself to garner attention towards yourself?
---
yes wow is trash we get it, activision ruined blizzard, everyone knows this. these kinds of posts really don't belong in the gw2 sub, if you want to rant about wow, do it in the wow sub.
---
You should make a guide on how to fly griffons properly.
---
No one needs 50 accounts like some of the people on the thread we're saying they had. It ruins the economies for the rest of us who play the game how it was intended.
---
Ya I don't get why there are so many WoW related posts in this sub reddit. Literally no one here cares how bad/good WoW is or if you're a special snowflake coming from there, just enjoy the game and rant somewhere else, GW2 has enough drama as it is.
---
They actually make great pets, very easy to housetrain
---
We can disagree without name calling
---
It's almost like they bought those accounts, thus funding your "free" GW2 content.
---
Except all these people that own multiple accounts have purchased the game multiple times and supported it this way. And I can't think of a single reason why ArenaNet or NCSoft want to discourage the purchase of their game, wether it is by new players or those that already own a copy of it.
---
a 3rd party app being affected by this or not is even highly irrelevant to this as the -email and -password functions were also available for non-multiboxers that just had shortcuts set up to launch into their alt-accounts.
---
Yeah i felt the same. Specially because you start playing with the 'new gang' (brahm rox and company) and it feels so odd at first.
---
wow has alienated a major part of their audience by casualifying the game, turning it into a participation trophy game, the same people who wouldn't enjoy gw2 because its casual are being driven out of wow because they are trying to cater to the short term players who will drop money on store mounts, they don't understand that those kind of players will get bored pretty soon and just unsub because even to casual players, it feels like a waste of time, they had something to aim for if they wanted to get better at their class and start doing the hard content eventually, now they don't, no one does.
---
I'm choosing to believe that it's a reference to Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy. He's posing as a lab rat so he can conduct experiments.
---
I guess I haven't seen, but why don't they let us play through it? 
---
The Jahai Rats were pretty big. Too bad they seem to be extinct. 
---
This is not disagreeing or agreeing.
---
This is me questioning your intellect and ability to analyze a given situation.
---
The game is free to play. Doesn't cost money to own other accounts
---
Bruv
---
Uh that's not true... Power chrono is one of the tighter rotations in the game especially during the CS combo. You're not mono sword either; the Domination build which parses higher uses GS.
---
I need a pet cat, check for some charr.
---
Last time I mentioned it here on this Reddit my post got downvoted to "Oblivion" (pun intended). Basically I got called out for not being able to find people for my raid guild like everyone else so far managed to do. This is definitely something this game needs, but I think the last chance of us getting tool like this would be with the upcoming "Alliances" update. If we don't get it then, I would drop all my hopes for it.
---
I'd imagine there are more important matters to attend to, like removal of memes and low-effort posts constantly flooding this sub-reddit in recent times, than supporting an obvious troll post meant to start drama...but, I guess we have different view on priorities.
---
Well...it's a long way from *Rat*a Sum...
---
I say god damn. Speed racer over here 
---
You're looking at this the wrong way. If you bought GW2 you can come back and play anytime (given if you want the expansions you gotta buy these). If you want to return to WoW (also having to buy expansions) you have to at least buy one month of subscription and if you don't like it after a few days you still feel pressured into playing it since you payed already. Rinse and repeat. I tried it during legion and kinda enjoyed it but then a major patch hit and all my gear was basically out-powercrept and I just paid for a month so I half-assed that month to not "waste" the time I paid for. I imagine people having played since release get forced into this even more to keep playing because otherwise all the time (any money) they spend will go to waste. 
---
While GW2 (and even GW) are games I stop playing for a few months every now and then, it doesn't feel like I wasted my time or money since everything is still there and I only gotta download the latest patch. I wouldn't pay money to go back and play WoW again because now I know they pull the same shit every expansion and it makes me feel like I wasted my time playing it.
---
Except it is almost impossible (or with a very bad RoI) to export materials/money from a F2P account to your main. Most accounts used for multi boxing have at least 1 expansion.
---
Yes that's it! 
---
By all means be concerned. There is nothing wrong with that. That is a perfectly reasonable question to ask. Why did this happen all of the sudden? Should I be concerned with the security of my account at this time? That is understandable to ask those questions.
---
I don't see the point in getting mad at Anet for taking a stand to try and make accounts remain secure. Concerned at the action taken yes, but not mad. I mean people to this day still fall for phishing scams and that has been done since before email was even a thing, and it is not just older people who fall for it.
---
Indeed, I'm attending to important matters, such as cleaning up low-effort attempts at trolling and personal attacks. Hence your warning and post removals.
---
Now, off you go.
---
well for story its mostly unfailable for one.
---
two im fine with the open world being the way it is on core tyria maps and populated maps. its only a problem on low population maps in expansions/living world since they tend to no scale from one player up like core events, they seem to scale up once more than 5 arrive telling me anet balanced it around a minimum of a full party. also game just looves dumping you into an empty instance sometimes even though the other instances have plenty of room.
---
I'm strictly a Solo player too. I did end up getting the commander tag (back when you had to get for every toon) :P - To help those having troubles with hero points, metas, or just people lost trying to find things. While some mobs do a lot of damage, I've never really had a problem with any story, episode, or map instance.
---
I'm extremely casual too. - No WvW (only for Gift of battle), No Pvp/Spvp, No raids, No fractals, No, Dungeons (because they're not rewarding enough or just to buy a part for a legendary) mainly normal Pve.
---
I do agree that a lot of the hero points on Hot's need to be run with a small group but you can just create a group in the LFG to see if other need it too. There are also trains that do a map run for hero points and metas.
---
\- I really wish they would add a track for Pve. Like the ones in WvW or PVP (just wishful thinking on my end)
---
Been suggesting this for years:
---
* Remove transmutation altogether.
---
* Let people save combinations of skins and dyes as custom outfits.
---
* Give every character 3 outfit slots. You can buy more with gems.
---
* Allow chat-code generation for custom outfits.
---
This would also allow any profession to use any armor class, as long as they don't combine chests and leggings of different classes. The weight restriction no longer has a point, since outfits already tore it apart. ArenaNet would now be able to design new armors without being forced to stick to skirts and buttcapes.
---
Yes, they do have the sane state of mind, but at least they aren't trapped by the commitment of a subscription. It's basically a deeper sunken cost. 
---
You get nothing from F2P accounts in terms of login rewards which is the main face point of this whole conversation. Sure you can do some JP parking characters but in that time you could do another meta with your main account.
---
You'd need to pay at least of a base account which are around 10 bucks usually (if you can find some) or you go and buy straight up new HoT or PoF keys to get your login rewards or whatever activity that is daily or weekly limited to one account.
---
You dont have to play it.
---
Go onto metabattle and look up commonly played builds. Look at the go-to skill variations. Mouse over mesmer skills to see what other players might bring to fights.
---
 It helps to know exactly what you're up against.
---
Or how the achievements haven't changed since last year, many of them awarding zero achievement points, thus making them pointless.
---
Price is a subscription key
---
&gt; Read the god dam reddit posts
---
which god damn reddit posts?
---
WoWs story might be fine, but the way you play through it feels incredibly messed up imo. Most of the story while playing is told through quest reward dialogue and some small voice lines here and there. Quests basically boil down to what OP described except you replace trolls by the current content major antagonists. The cinematics are quite impressive as well but the cutscenes are really half-assed and mostly just something blowing up.
---
Sunk cost is a hell of a drug.
---
Sunk subscription fees are hellacious to break free from.
---
But that's not what the thread above is saying.
---
The thread isn't 'They have to invest $12~ when they come back, so they have to keep playing', it's 'They've sunk in time and money for the time they've played the game, so they can't stop'.
---
Your point is valid, just not exactly what the parent thread is trying to say. In all fairness, though, I spend less on a month-to-try-out-an-mmo than I do on the month I spend on a gem store item, because of the difference in business model.
---
man I bought 4 GW1 accounts in total to have more Xunlai Chests. Every account stored something else I grinded with my main account. Skills books, goldies, you name it
---
Make the achievements permanent instead of annual, and award achievement points for completing them.
---
That would be a good start.
---
If none of the other suggestions in this thread work, trying moving the d3d9.dll file out of the bin folder and into the main gw2 folder. My client seems to have a weird issue with this sometimes as well, most of the time the d3d9s will only load if they are placed into the main gw2 folder.
---
That's what they need to do to the now-useless Traveler Rune.  Could be an alternative to Trapper runes
---
25 Condition Damage
---
+5% Condition Duration
---
50 Condition Damage
---
+10% Condition Duration
---
100 Condition Damage
---
+25% movement speed, gain 6 stacks of might and 1 second of resistance every 20 seconds in combat
---
they're possible to solo but clearly not intended to be, hard yes but also really annoying with how damage spongy the enemies can be. i have tried it. from open world events ive noticed dynamic scaling doesnt change enemy damage output much, just health but the scaling is turned off in dungeons. would it really be that hard to turn it back on?
---
&gt; As someone who only has one account and isn't affected by this update at all you may find this opinion worthless.
---
You nailed it.
---
Um I'm using 32 free to play accounts and my friends all use multiple f2p accounts so idk what you're talking about. 
---
Read the goddamn post before getting all high an mighty maybe? 
---
They removed it. Everything was marketed as temporary "play now or miss forever" content.
---
Yeah, pretty dumb ass decision. [Still hopping they bring it back some day.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Lon-ami/Living_World_Season_1)
---
Tis a long road for the winged steed. Good luck on your journey ;)
---
oh ive experimented a lot with solo builds (marauder gear!) and they do help a LOT.
---
Isn't this the same as pack runes?
---
It is... ;)
---
i'll look into after i finally get that griffon.
---
Depends on how it’s stored, to be honest. Something like LaunchBuddy at least stores the info encrypted.
---
I was specifically referring to the command line being visible while the app was running as the small attack vector, as it requires a lot more involvement. The storage of the login data in a shortcut is obviously much more vulnerable, as that information is available as long as the machine is powered. 
---
Then you're doing it wrong.
---
Ty ^___^
---
We ALL do!  
---
Anet--- make it a purchasable add-on!  Use the map assets you already have to give instanced content.  I.  WILL.  BUY.  THIS.
---
You're not wrong. People nuke you from orbit here if you post something disagreeable.
---
On topic, though, scaling has been an issue historically with GW2. Aside from HoT, which was designed around group event explicitly, most of GW2 outside meta events probably should be manageable eithet solo or with small groups, but scaling can get wonky on both sides. I've found that 3 players is about the sweet spot where you can finish nearly everything, but scaling can turn easy solo stuff into nightmares with 3, and the only reason 3 works is because a lot of stuff doesn't scale or barely scales from base with that many people. But a scaling pass on every event would be a ton of work without much return, unfortunately, so it's unlikely to happen..
---
Just random people clueless about what security is complaining...  
---
Exposing login credentials like they had was a really unsecured way to do things and should have never existed.  
---
Northern featherwing. Gold for the feathers and shark blue for the eyes
---
F2P accounts grant no log in rewards.
---
F2P accounts are not what multi account owners use as they give zero benefit becuase they do not get login rewards and cannot move their earnings off the account, every account a multiboxer uses is a full blown paid for account.
---
Team switching in activities and hotjoin pvp is just outright horrible, and it only makes the problem of uneven teams worse.
---
When teams are uneven, there should be AI filling missing spots, or odd players should have to wait in Spectator mode for another player to join so they can both join at the same and keep teams even.
---
4 players should not have their fun ruined and be forced to fight outnumbered and see people in their team leave and make things worse so 1 player can join a game sooner. 
---
How has this thread not been removed for stirring up Drama?

Working on forming a pro Griffin airteam :3.  Tis gonna take a while though hehe

---
Tybalt, introduction!
---
Yes, commander
---
Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:  
---
* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.
---
they broke it for "Security" Reasons, for what do we use throwaway random generated password for our multiple accounts, but no we can't have the player take its own responsibility
---
Maybe you should connect the brain before reply ? I simple missed Launchbuddy.
---
Best place to practice is Divinities reach.  Going around the inner circle 
---
If it makes you feel any better, I had to open 125 chests to get it. I only got one rare item from all those chests as well. I was hoping for a Leather/Tailor glyph. I won't be buying anymore keys until next content patch. 
---
Good job, Tybalt! Have and [apple cider]!
---
Ahh, that hit the spot.
---
Thank you commander. 
---
Just don't give it a sock.
---
What the starting areas offer aren't fun for many people. You've seen 1 event chain you've seen them all, a lot of them still don't have breakbars, everything is so easy you never need to use anything but offensive abilities.  
---
 Like I'm sorry but the vanilla game failed at being interesting or hard enough for people to want to dedicate the time to get to max lvl and my friends are far from the only example. I've added multiple "new players" on disc so I could help them out and teach them about the game and every time I ask why aren't they playing after being offline for a week they say it's boring. 
---
 I who loves GW2 completely agree with them on that, like sorry but the events are alright at best when you do them the first time but then fall flat. Especially when 98% of them are impossible to fail or present any real danger to the player (where you find big bad bandit that 1shots you I would really love to know, because I certainly didn't find any) and my vote is either overhaul to today's standards, add some actually challenging dungeons/fracs that require coop and thinking or cut off all the excess levels. I'd much rather improve the starting experience than go around telling people "Hmph! this is CLEARLY not the game for you!" like a snob. It's boring af to veteran gamers and noobs alike because nobody ever has to do anything more than spam dps and use personal heal. Why people like you are so opposed to more content (that all levels would do) will forever be baffling to me. Yh the grind has to be there it's an MMO, but it doesn't have to be so mind-numbingly boring. 
---
Cheers
---
Except what has? none of that was true. You seem angrier with each reply and I become less willing to entertain your point of view
---
Do you happen to have any examples? I’m honestly not understanding where all this multiboxing hate comes from. How is multiboxing specifically the problem?
---
&gt;	It's easy to say that multiboxing is okay as long as the ToS are followed, but for every person out there following the ToS, there's probably at least one exploiting the game's systems
---
This could literally be said about any aspect of the game though... It’s easy to say that playing PvP is ok as long as the ToS is followed...
---
Well there's a meat shop right in front of it in case it doest sell.
---
[um...](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini_Sunspear_Kina)
---
The original post, as far as I could see, was a genuine opinion. As unpopular or misinformed as they may be, there was no reason to remove the thread.
---
Oh man I hope you just got a bad support rep. I really don't want to be locked out of completing the full collection because of a bug, especially after farming all that map currency. I'll report back when/if they reply to my ticket.
---
i keep seeing people suggesting the mentor tag and...i never really thought to try that.
---
next time im exploring and feeling antisocial ill give it a try.
---
Still waiting for an actual point instead of more impotent babyrage.
---
 I feel like that sort of problem would solve itself if there was enough players during most hours of the day. Easier said than done tho
---
To be fair, those who would quit based on a change like this were already teetering. Even as one of the devs working on LB, I wouldn’t quit because of this change, even if there weren’t alternative ways of handling things. 
---
The main difference is in the 6-set bonus. 
---
Rune of the Pack gives 125 Precision, as well as Might, Fury, and Swiftness for up to five allies. 
---
This one gives passive movement speed, Vigor instead of Swiftness, and the boons only apply to yourself. The ICD is also shorter than the former (20s instead of 30s). 
---
In short, the new rune is better suited for solo play, eg solo roaming in WvW, especially since it frees up a trait or utility slot that was previously used for movement speed. 
---
No they didn't, that's just a lie. Before Istan RIBA was the only activity outside of fractals worth more than 15 gph. It's NEVER been viable to get decent returns for most activities in the game.
---
I played the whole thing and was pretty into it while it was happening so I remember it well but I'd absolutely play it again if it were remade, and I think it should be, if not only for the fact that, as another poster said, that content introduced most of the characters with whom we're allied now. It's an integral missing step in game immersion for anyone who wasn't there.
---
So because some people missunderstood some things here. I'm not having a problem with muliboxing, the problem is that I can not log in into the other accounts the by doing it on the normal game launcher.
---
I also deleted the local.dat file but this didn't help.
---
I couldn't even launch my client. Getting 1kb/s updates. Tried to troubleshoot the issue but nothing works. Server performance has been extremely unreliable for the past 30 hours.
---
Your best option at this point would probably be to watch the cutscenes on youtube, or read the scripts from the wiki. 
---
That said, it is a shame that new players can't experience it as a whole. Kasmeer and Marjory flirting and finally kissing during the fight with Scarlet, Kasmeer revealing that she fights in the nude and her dress is an illusion, the blatant flirting between Braham and Rox that got turned into a sibling thing later...
---
Taimi was always annoying, though, even from the beginning. That hasn't changed. 
---
Please revert the change of the credential cmd Argument!
---
or at least give us an option to save mutliple account credentials in the launcher!
---
Did you ban him now?
---
No, RagnarokHorizon deleted their posts themselves.
---
Minis are supposed to be clockwork toys, though, right? So we're not really buying people, we're just buying oversized action figures of them that follow us around. Probably helps fund the war effort.
---
If they come back because of lack of QoL, then it is based on quality of the games, not because they invested here. They got comparison and they found out that this is still better for them.
---
Oh yeah! I am getting fond flashbacks of that game and system now. That game was way ahead of its time when it came to fashion. I even recall buying some of the outfits!
---
i would even accept an abridged version that was like 4-5 episodes...i just that gap in the story makes my brain itch in an irritating way.
---
Destruction of Lion's Arch meta was pretty fun.

I played on Abaddon for a long time, it was okay-ish. Switched to Elona for my guild and I am quite happy there, though I tend to play strange hours, lots of early mornings (hi Elona Night Watch). The evenings can be quite crowded, which I think is good. Lots of public runs

Not really getting this reference if I’m being honest...
---
Lol, how can you be this much of an asshole? These people literally volunteer their time to make this sub what it is and in comes you, somebody who contributes nothing to it, to criticize them for doing their job. 
---
Fuck off with your shitty attitude. 
---
I've got a theory (ha Buffy referendum). Anyhoo I have a theory the expansion team could be working on season 1 and thats why we are getting two seasons of living world before any expansion. I could be wrong and they need longer for the 3rd expansion but this is my theory.
---
"day 293, no one's noticed i'm not a pet"
---
If it was this simple, they would have already done it.
---
Are you implying there aren't people that are literally addicted to computers/videogames? We are talking about the exact same thing here, lack of self control. You're the one grabing straws, really. I'm not comparing surfing the web to drugs. I'm saying being addicted to gambling is your fault just as much as it is for people with compulsive eating disorders/internet obsessions.
---
Thanks for all your work so far, LB was a boon to many of us.
---
Not for sale. That's the feeder cage.
---
Just when I thought Anet couldn't destroy their game any more they go and pull this
---
&gt;Before Istan RIBA was the only activity outside of fractals worth more than 15 gph. 
---
Nope. Just as an example, you could farm branded for luminous dust (@10-12 silver/ea) in Iron Marches for easy 20g/hr if you. Then radiant in Fields of Ruin for similar amounts.  Anyone who pays attention to market rather than complaining and knows what they're doing can [make far more than the popular farms](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/35063/research-drop-rates-of-materials-from-foes-and-influence-of-magic-find).  40+g/hr solo farm existed for months in PoF, never saw anyone there.
---
Mordremoth was located at an Ley Line Hub, what directed it's magic to Tarir (Aurene) and the Bloodstone further north. Without that, the explosion would have destroyed maguuma completely as seen with the blood stone. Without Balthazar, the explosion would have reached DR.
---
This but unironically

The local.dat needs to be updated each time the client updates. Assuming you only ever run the accounts as -sharearchive, which is the way accounts were always run in LaunchBuddy, this would mean that apart from initial setup, every new version afterwards would need to go through an update on each local.dat. 
---
Apparently it’s about a 30MB download? I don’t have actual numbers but that was my impression. We could proxy it to a local source, to cut down on time and bandwidth, but for anything more than a few accounts that’s not a small chunk of time. LB would essentially need to -image with every. Single. Local.dat, every single time. 
---
During the first season of living world Anet intended to give us small but constant updates that would change the maps forever. Their first season wanted to create the immersion that Tyria is a “living world”. 
---
The season implemented a lot of open world events that scarred the maps like Kessex Hills and Lornar Pass and also added points of interests. The problem was that since the story had to keep moving implementing every release more changes the old releases became quickly unavailable. If you were not there to see the tower of nightmares rise and collapse you suddenly just find out a Kessex Hills destroyed.  
---
Most of us didn’t like the feeling of missing content and also the achievements tied to those releases would also be locked forever unattainable. 
---
The system wasn’t bad, it was just not what the community wanted. I can say I was there during the attack/destruction/rebuild of Lion’s Arch and it was a really cool story and events they were doing which I guess just made things worst when you couldn’t play then anymore.

r/woooosh
---
I have a lvl 49 twink that I open the bags on. Should I sell the exotics directly or salvage? I always salvage everything in SW to raise my luck.
---
The bloodstone explosion would have reached DR if not for Balthazar absorbing the magic. I think the magic explosion plotline was developed after LW1 and 2 for HoT and later content.
---
Oh damn, i didnt know the griffon was there. I thought it has never on the vendor yet so i thought it will be up soon.
---
I was thinking to blow 60 keys to get the statuettes now since the guaranteed drop are the envelope which worth at least 1g each rather than ToT or the xmas gift box. But it just doesnt sound wise to blow that much money on gambling (plus i want to vote with my wallet).
---
And it changes every month? Maybe i should wait for a better exclusive since i dont like the dragon glider.
---
Thank you so much for sharing btw, you gave me a 2nd thought about this. Oh and one more thing, you can get keys from lvl 40 and 60 story quest as well? Im so glad i never done the story quest pass lvl 10 if its true.
---
WOOOOOSH
---
Don't forget that LS are all lvl 80 content. Also 200 gems is like 70 gold, so one can buy at least part of them by gold. That way it might take some time, but won't be that costly.
---
Also if you have LS2, you can take him through it (non owners of LS2 can join owners of LS2 in story instances), reducing the initial cost while retaining the story steps. He can buy it then later when achievements/collections will emerge to be wanted from it. Maps are accessible to anyone anyways.
---
This trick does not work for newer seasons, though.
---
I'm using the Mac client.  Every time an activity finishes, by completion or cancelation, the client crashes.

*yall mind if we make the game worse?*
---
how much luck you would say is considered okay to try to open them instead of selling them?
---
they nerfed victory or death years ago to be soloable. its still annoying but i cant imagine how bad it used to be.
---
If you do the first (or maybe second) mission in the Path of Fire story you'll get your first (probably) mount. It's a little bit of time, but absolutely worth it. Also you can slightly dye said mount in the dye page.

Guys, dont use a firework that no longer drops since 2014 and its 40s on the trading post atm, instead of fireworks that drop in mass, 5 times or more cheaper.

Or feed it after midnight!

Anet is honestly the biggest expert in that field at this point

They have enough material to write a trilogy of books and get a Netflix series about it

Aw man... I loved that bug... those things were actually a fun challenge to kill

Same, I have the same issues yesterday, now I can't even get the client to startup, 1kb/s updates followed by "connection error(s). retrying". Spend hours trouble-shooting, nothing works...

To be honest i tried being a dick and not revive a downed player, it destroyed me mentally the next day at work...i just tested to see if that person still thinks this community is nice *as an experiment

You've gone like five comments without making a single point. I can't communicate with someone who isn't saying anything.
---
Make a point and we can discuss it. Otherwise, you're just raging because you don't know economics and don't like that people told you when you were wrong.
---
I've responded. That I haven't decided to agree with your overtly aggressive opinions isn't indication you've been "dismissed." You seem to have trouble understanding that. If you're offended for some reason, go ahead and refer to your comment where you thought it was ok to start name calling.

I'd really fancy a pet big man, do they have any norn?

Ha, a glider that, when deployed, didn't work. So you keep falling with a winged pig
---
I was in the same boat as you, didn't play since 2013, and have been hooked again for the last 3 months. Get the expansions, its a whole new world and I was happy to see gw2 is still very much active, even while leveling.
---
And he's holding a sign that says "we're going to can't!"
---
Season 5 is season 1, AND we get an expansion as well! They never said they aren't working on one!
---
Wait... No banners? Why?
---
That's why the Bantu peoples are the majority population in South Africa now.
---
They came south in the late 1600s after whites had settled the western cape nearly 100 years earlier.
---
They drove the existing tribes south and west and slaughtered a very large % of them and sold the rest into slavery.
---
Sadly they as the majority control the government now and still treat the other peoples like crap.
---
That you have trouble communicating was evident when you called me an idiot simply for not agreeing with a poorly formed internet argument. You're a self-deluded troll and nothing more. Bye!
---
Which is funny, since I think there was a scratch forming on a cliff East of Amnoon along the Southern border of the zone. I think there's a Rich Ori vein or some kind of Rich node that spawns there and it's filled with hostile mobs. I don't think the skritt that were living there were able to survive the desert well. Which, now that I think about it, there weren't *any* skritt in the desert...
---
Lay off the salt.
---
For real.  I've gotten almost unbelievably lucky with the last few exclusive items, usually getting it within 10 chests, and means that the temptation to get more this time is really high. But this is a good reminder that it ain't worth it in the long run.  
---
that's funny, tell another one!
---
Not to overstate it but those events were awesome. The maps were fun. The event with 5 platforms where you have to work together to take down clockwork enemies was great. The map with the power up crystals was such a cool map. It's really a waste of great stuff to not have the stuff available anymore. 
---
Been running diviners FB myself.
---
Works incredibly well since guard has traits that make loss of crit a non issue.
---
Plan to try diviners on ren soon as well since they have traits that do the same.
---
It should always be us (the player) helping the hero imo 
---
It’s lots of profit for very little work though, total understandable that he does this when he has so many.
---
Best bot I’ve seen so far

This. I honestly used to get upset at people who said this because it sounded so flippant, but it's true. Your character has its 1-80 leveling experience where you learn the class, weapons, skills, traits, etc. Then you hit 80 and suddenly ALL this content is there for you. Fractals, Raids, Expansions, etc.

My favourite thing about Scarlet is the way that she wasn't just an non-Asura admitted to learn at the colleges, she mastered the teachings and graduated from all three schools. Wow. Then she went and learned smithing from the greatest smiths in Tyria and managed to surpass them too. I'm also impressed at the way she managed to cobble together alliances between xenophobic groups who, by all rights, should hate each other due to their racial supremacist ideologies. But nope, Flame Legion Charr who capture and keep slaves and who have primarily a religious based ideology would obviously strike an alliance with Dredge who are Tyrian notCommunists with a strong atheistic bent and an opposition to slavery due to their past as slaves to the Stone Summit Dwarves. Of course Scarlet brought these two groups together by ??? because why the fuck not? It also makes perfect sense that there was an alliance between Krait and literally any non-Krait group. That's not completely lore abhorrent at all. The Inquest-Pirate alliance at least wasn't a completely bizarre combination even if the whole "Scarlet forged an alliance and pulled yet another army out of her ass schtick" hadn't long, long out lived its welcome.
---
So, no, I disagree strongly. Scarlet wasn't a cool or interesting character indicative of really strong writing. Scarlet's entire story reads like self-insert fanfiction where the new character is just the bestest and strongest at everything with no real flaws and can pull off bizarre, lore breaking acts with no real consequence or consideration. It was dumb back when it released and it's still dumb now.
---
or maybe just let them be legendary for the stat swap without any effect, and keep slowly releasing the flashy ones like aurora and the such
---
I think its because a bunch of wow players have migrated to guild wars after BFA, because its basically hot timegated, microtransaction garbage. 
---
Brilliance charms drops more often than all others (because more runes have this attribute than any other).
---
My answer is not agressive, it's straight to the point.
---
What makes you think it was a clear intent from Anet ? From the point of view of other players, it was just easy. Expansions (and Orr before that) powercreeped both player power and ennemy power. But that does not illustrate a clear intent for Anet to allow soloing the whole game.
---
and no matter how well stored the password is, if someone has total access to your machine enough to read a text file, they have enough access to keylog your password on entry.
---
The more you know.
---
Yeah, same boat. 
---
My fun is priceless, and I get it where I find it. Money is bitches drug.
---
It's easy to unsubscribe and resubscribe when you want to play, right ? I knew players who did that for years, just coming back a few months for each expansion.
---
The good writing wasn't until season 2 where they gave us a reason to be interested in Scarlett.
---
Everyone is special 
---
I had no problem Yeeting out of wow. Legion brought me back and I had tons of fun, really reminded me in essence of the golden years. But BFA took everything that was wrong with Legion and made it worse, and basically didn't build on anything that players really enjoyed.   
---
I liked the story of BFA, and the 'campaign' started out quite good. But I seriously lost patience when I realised I'm hard grinding for something that was time gated anyway. 
---
throw rifle DE in god tier.
---
Extremely low risk/ high reward build especially in wvw due to huge open areas.
---
Capable of one or 2 shotting even Tanky builds. 
---
Low risk as this can be done from range, in stealth. Extremely easy disengage and engage via. Shadowstep, stealth, rifle 4. 
---
the only classes that can really bring you down are high burst classes but even then it’s unlikely they will one shot you meaning you can disengage and perma stealth til lyou have cooldowns back. Classes with reflects can also kill you if you aren’t careful.
---
You can also switch it up to condi DE and have much lower burst in exchange for extremely strong DoT and much higher survivability. 
---
But not in open world 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers
---
Gotcha. Good info, thanks!
---
Actually it really doesn't
---
Your friend still lost more time than the player above who worked and spent IRL money for the same result. Endless grinding is never money-saving, especially when you have a good situation. And it can spoil the fun of playing too.
---
so you want everyone to quit the game like they quit raids? 
---
You could have put at the end of your original post: 
---
I did nothing to earn the gear on my account I actually just got carried by people who know how to play the game this is why I’m failing to understand simple game mechanics.
---
Oh God. How much does it cost?
---
Caffeinated loot skritt.
---
Oh, and the legendary armor is not only about li. Is about farming tons of things, tons of hot maps, tons of time gating materials and so on, too. 
---
&gt; they are already working on the way to make players lose boons ant the start of the fight.
---
I mean, raids are a thing where that happens. If they've been around this long and it's not been applied to other things, shows they must be okay with it.
---
It was made available in statuettes last May it seems.
---
&gt; And it changes every month?
---
More or less. [Check out the BLC history](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Black_Lion_Chest&amp;action=history). BLC drops change either with every LW release or festival, or after roughly a month. This month's a bit odd that we had the All or Nothing chest for only two weeks.
---
&gt; Oh and one more thing, you can get keys from lvl 40 and 60 story quest as well?
---
Yes, [there are five keys rewarded from story in total](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Chest_Key#Story_rewards), and unlike the level 10 key, they're not gated by week.
---
The level 40 one isn't too hard, especially if you have a lot of birthday experience scrolls still.
---
you missed nothing besides scrubs dying on the 4th of 5 platforms ruining a challenge for everyone lol
---
This is kind of why I actually wish ANet did this with ALL of the Living Story — made it take place all over the world and create permanent change. Then again, I'd like to see areas that got damaged and aren't called Lion's Arch actually get rebuilt as well (Fort Salma or whatever is still in ruins... it even has a waypoint in it I think...).
---
But the experience of "living through" events that came and went, that the world is truly both dynamic and persistent, really made GW2 feel quite special to me. The days of Scarlet's War are still probably the best that playing GW2 got for me, apart from the experience of Raiding with friends.
---
Yes, people would complain that they can't replay past stuff... well, yeah, that would be the price we pay for being able to experience a game world of that kind, where the story actually matters and things evolve. I'd much sooner have that than nothing but these frozen-in-time LS expansion maps.
---
Scarlet's hideout under the Priory is a point of interest for map completion. Discovering that place was SO COOL back when we did it. But part of that is also that Scarlet was a much more interesting villain than whatever we're doing now, where it's like mcguffin piled on mcguffin to advance a story that seems to have no effect on anything except one new map that I'm going to never see again.  
---
Yep. I swap the first bag slot for an invisible bag so I don't accidentally vendor armour etc... The starter backpack then just goes into another slot as I only have 20 slot bags except for that 32 slot you got from Sandswept Isles.
---
Too bad it's soulbound.
---
I totally agree here, but wiki is missing them and i just posted a wiki screenshot, because ppl are buying the 40s ones
---
same here, fractals of the mist looked incredibly boring too and everything that came after it was meh
---
Might wanna sit down for this... You need to buy a total of 250g worth of collection items from various karma vendors.
---
Maybe its just the first step they take. Implementing a lot huge luck sinks at once would be terrible for people still wanting their luck to push magic find. Could be that next year you find yourself lacking luck for new achievements/stuff. Hard to imagine, but think about mithril. Myself and I think everyone that played a decent amount had dozens of stacks stored in their guild bank. A month ago was the first time I had to actually buy some and even mine the nodes again. 
---
Mordremoth's death didn't cause an explosion, as I pointed out - when we kill the Mouth (aka Mordremoth's core body) there's that cyan blue flash of light, but no explosion. The artistic cinematic was depicting something that eyes could not see. Same goes for the Season 1 ending cinematic - it shows bright lights and explosive cracks, but dialogue after the Scarlet's End instance merely stated there was a brief flash of light (same as Mordy's death scene).
---
And even if Mordremoth's death did cause an explosion, the ley lines would not have held it at the epicenter and the Pact remnants in the Maguuma would have been wiped out.
---
On top of that, Zhaitan wasn't killed atop of a ley line hub, so where'd that magical explosion channel to?
---
Critical Strikes - Trickery - Deadeye
---
Constant boons with markings, invigorating precision to heal you constantly, and insane burst with backstabs.
---
Also works with Daredevil, but then trickery loses it's effectiveness, but you get much better AoE.
---
Raids are more strictly structured, fractals have a lot of cases where trash fight  seamlessly transits into the boss. Literally the first boss of 99cm does that with it's 3 adds, would be really strange to strip boons in the middle of it. 
---
I guess it would work more like stripping boons from the group if anyone picks up mistlock singularity?
---
I actually liked fractals, but only ended up trying them much much later when it had more. 
---
you put it perfectly well mate
---
didnt even care about them when i first met it but maybe it was the cringy german translation and voice acting they did
---
I'd have started with more clarity on hitboxes and ping because ... I play on ~40ms and I see projectiles hitting me that should not hit me in any proper game.
---
Short term, sure just buy gem cards.  But long term, a single account is worth up to (or over) 1000 gold per year depending on how much time you invest in it.
---
Minimum activity of opening daily chest is approx 250 mystic coins and 700 laurels per year.
---
Perform dailies on that account (not feasible with 12 accounts, but doable on 2 or 3)-  add 730 gold to the above, plus event rewards.
---
Park 4 alts at Sharkmaw jumping puzzle and open the chest 4x daily (takes less than 2 minutes) - add around 150 Silver Doubloons to the above total.
---
I paid $10 for my second account two years ago.  I have long exceeded the 800 gems I could have bought instead.
---
Ah roger roger. I'm not up on the lingo you kids use nowadays.

Wiki is free for anyone to edit. Find something missing, add it yourself. Don't worry about formatting, others can fix that if you mess it up.

I edited the wiki to include those as well, so your screenshot is out of date and misinformative.

Me as a Asura.. I definitly vote for the kink part.
---
Then I remembered this is the second game in the series and in reality Minis pre-date Asura in terms of game mechanics.
---
I thought wiki edits needed a admin aproval or something. Anyway, i cant edit the screen, so will just depete the post as it is indeed outdated.
---
&gt; Priory just takes aged unless theres a big event.
---
Well now it does...since they fixed the wurm spawns.  There used to be a couple where there were 10+ wurms spawned on top of each other allowing for really fast heart completion.
---
I never do any extracts. I run around the map in different instances over and over till I get them all.
---
Season 1 + Kralkatorrik expansion? Take my $100.
---
I am lagging since like 2-3 weeks now ? Not exactly lagging though but it looks like a very bad FPS even if its around 50-60. Floppy running with the character.. I am going nuts these days too.. Started on christmas with pings so I thought its because theres a lot people online.. but NOW I have it exactly like that. Good FPS... No Ping... CPU is "okay" too, at least not that it would cause lags but its horrible. Especially if I also watch Netflix or something on the computer its like Laghaven. -.- I am getting extremely annoyed.
---
OP's left
---
He scored a 78 on his final dissertation and so was legally declared an animal by Asuran society.
---
So fast!
---
&gt; Maybe Arena Net didn't think about the magic explosion stuff while developing the core game. The whole thing feels tucked on considering that Zhaitans story feels completely out of place in comparison to what we know about Mordremoth and Kralkatorrik.
---
Certainly plausible, except for the fact that Mordremoth's death caused no explosion. Whether from the perspective of the Commander cutting down Trahearne in the heart of the Heart of Thorns, or from the perspective of the Pact soldiers killing Mordremoth's core body, there was a flash of light, but no explosion.
---
&gt; The first event that completely alienated the whole Zhaitan plot from HoT and PoF was the blood stone explosion. This established that wild magic can destroy half of the continent. Even tho all events before that, never even mentioned this fact.
---
I disagree. Firstly, we do have some examples of magic being released haphazardly being detrimental - the Jade Wind and Abaddon's death being the two most prime examples. When Shiro was killed, all the magic he held in through dark rituals was unleashed and petrified nearly half the continent of Cantha; while when Abaddon was killed, his body broke apart and his magic became volatile (much like with Balthazar).
---
While Mordremoth's magic was released at once, it was not volatile in its release. Glint's was the same, as explored in the short story The Trek of the Zephyrites, and Zhaitan's was no doubt the same as well.
---
Like comparing a dam releasing water to a dam bursting. One is done in a controlled, less dangerous manner, while the other is done in an uncontrolled, hazardous manner.
---
There's a difference between teaching someone and being an asshole because deep down you're a cruel person who enjoys trying to humiliate people. Try to keep up without letting your need to win win over you

Woah... that looks really nice. Good job on that one. I wish I could draw like that, then I'd do the same with my Asura. :)
---
Well, I haven't really tested extensively.  My account Magic Find is around 260% right now, and I've been opening them for the past couple of years (when my MF was lower), but of course boosters are key.  You want to stack the boosters, and the Silverwastes boost, and all those other things to get to 700-800% or more.  If you can do that, then give it a shot.
---
There's still RNG involved.  Things could go poorly for you even with a higher Magic Find, or you could get lucky even with a low Magic Find.  But the more Envelopes you open, the better the chance that it evens out.
---
Oh god the Xera Portal with 30min cooldown. That must be pretty frustrating.

Dominator staff skin looks like greatsword

Okay, if you're going to use fast food restaurants as your example...
---
All fast food chains are required to post the caloric content of their food prominently on every menu. That is a US law. If only there were a law that required Anet to disclose the percentages of their drop rates...

Regardless, I am guessing you don't know anyone who is addicted to something, if you think addiction is "just a lack of self control." Enjoy your privilege, I guess.

---
&gt; What security issue? You mean the one where some brainlet gets 50 different keyloggers from the shady website they visited without noscript and adblock?
---
No, I'm talking about the point that your login data are stored in plain text. And that you - the user - would need to take action to use this function in a save way. 
---
Brainless acting or not, this function was provided by Anet, so Anet was in charge to make it save. The way it was, every account that was hacked because of this function, was Anets fault, because they provided an unsecure way to store your login data. And it doesn't matter if you use addblocker etc. or not. 
---
So it's not only an issue for us users, but also an important thing for Anet. If a company works with costumer data and can't keep them safe, it's a big problem. 
---
Same here. Was doing Xera, we all fell, couldn't gg, didn't die from fall damage, tried relogging and now getting network error on all chars.
---
That's exactly what I do, too. Except the first slots are always my character's starting equipment followed by all the weapon types that character can use (barring the types I have equipped).
---
Oh you
---
Well he just got lucky.
---
You can also make 400g from a meta by "simply" getting a precursor drop.
---
Nah, conspiracy should be "after Season 4 will be a brief break before Season 5 to add in Season 1".
---
If you ask me, that's what should happen. End of a season/expansion, next release brings back 1/3rd of Season 1 (Lost Shores to Last Stand at Southsun). Following season ends, another 1/3rd of Season 1 (Dragon Bash to Clockwork Chaos). Then one more season ends, the last 1/3rd of Season 1 (Tower of Nightmares to Battle for LA: Aftermath).

I've been trying to get t4 as well and I do tag up and organize one of the outposts, but that seems to be JUST not enough, since we have gotten t3 and like 3/4ths the last 3 times I've done it. Just gotta keep trying and hope to catch enough people on the lfg.

Yes

Mesmer master class
---
Check r/guildrecruitment for some guilds that focus on hot metas. I happened to come across one in game once and the commander there was super organized and it was the first time I got t4 after several attempts in vb. 
---
Know what would be great? If every few years or so, they'd restart that chain of events, and give us a couple weeks to play through them. I was I school when they came out, and managed to miss a good chunk of them.
---
Let Chaos reign!
---
Maybe he's a spy.
---
Depending on why they changed it, that may not matter.
---
I.E. If it was audit related.... well, auditors don't always do things that make sense. I remember a PCI auditor telling us we were required to set our user login restrictions on our Linux servers in the Login.defs file.... a file that was no longer used by default in our Linux servers. That functionality was handled by a tool called PAM, which was more powerful..... but it didn't matter. As our Security director told us at the time "Being compliant doesn't always mean being secure."
---
Another point is, that the player/user/costumer shouldn't be in charge  of the security of a function a company provides. The company is responsible to make their software/tool/function safe. 
---
Yes, there are ways to work with these parameters in a secure way, but it would be Anets fault if you get hacked because of it, even if you don't use those secure ways. Because Anets provided function are not safe. 
---
Otherwise you'd have infinite 20 slot bags?
---
Don't worry, I got it.

Yeah, the only reason I was able to get a griffon was that someone helped me craft/sell a legendary for a decent profit.
---
Nuts.  I love these videos new dong what you are doing!!!
---
You know what makes ma happy? To report you stupid insult. 
---
Come back, when you learned how to talk to people...
---
I just love watching your stuff mate
---
nah dude you didn't miss out on anything. As a person who played back then and quit during it and now coming back to the game. I do not regret it at all. It's the same weird disconnect feeling I already had at the start of the game. Either way you will feel lost in this game and I am a player all about the story. GW2's story, they're getting better over time so the first season is considered one of the worst periods of GW2, not just story wise. 
---
I can't get any NPC relationships going on this game and I beat the game. I feel no connection to the Living Story seasons at all and starting on Episode 10 HoT right now, only connection I feel to HoT is literally Maguuma Jungle.... Last time I was here I was chasing somebody else and I fought the White Mantle.
---
PoF is even better for us GW players apparently as their writing has gotten better as well. Even ArenaNet realizes the problem and is trying their best to solve it with their expansion packs and the latest LS seasons.
---
Take your time.
---
They mostly are representing druids, which already is an elite specialization of the ranger. With another expansion we most likely will get nine new elite specializations, one for each class - that's the closest thing to expect regarding "a new class", given the fact that these are much easier to implement than a new class (which would need not only the base class, but also three elite specializations to be on par with the rest of the classes)
---
They do it each time to keep the  best farm paywalled. Sw nerfed chest amount after HoT, AB nerfed after berries, berries nerfed  etc then istan was due a nerf when either ls5 or expac 3 came so that a new farm would be atttractive and behind the next paywall. after the following episode is released anyone who comes after has to pay money to access the farm, like they did if they  started the game post istan etc.
---
Sand. Support. Now think very hard.
---
See different perspectives here, my friend likes the skin but not love em, he can live without em he's been playing the game, i used the "gold farming" loosely here coz he has more gold than me, coz he's online more than me and enjoys the game more. It even piss me off when he told me how many mystic coin he has. 😡, those are what.. 1 gold each right? 
---
I kinda not agree when u said he lost time when he enjoyed every moment of it.
---
What? If I get a keylogger or anyone as privileged access to my computer (which he gets when I download a malicious file and execute it), it makes absolutely no difference at all. Wether he finds them in plain text or just deletes the local.dat, making me re-enter my credentials on the next start-up and just logging them then is the exact same result with just marginally more work.
---
Ya, I really like the Living World idea, but they really need to have a better way of experiencing things you’ve missed. Either by somehow letting you replay it, or better summery. The short 5min speech you get from the Explorer really wasn’t enough to understand each of the new characters.
---
I’d settle for a short series on YouTube to show the most important events and dialogue 
---
Big facts.
---
It was, they disabled `-nopatchui` so it's not possible now. 
---
Sylvari traders getting some payback
---
Yes I got those same feelings that they were on par with Druid, but it was a few things that set themselves apart from druids. Like when they made you bigger, and the crazy shields coming out there head, and that amazing lightening storm that they called down! 
---
Better remove in game chat, users may type sensitive information into it.
---
There are a lot of focuses with many different looks. From a piece of bloodstone, a ale mug, a gobleet, a scroll, a book etc.
---
  
---
Some harpoons look like rifles instead, and some spears look like tridents.
---
There arent that many distinct weapons that look like a different weapon type, but there are many unique looking weapons which are "imitating" the weapon type they are mechanically being used for , such as a risen hand HOLDING a dagger being a dagger
---
I bought all my alt accounts for $5 each. If you look for the right deal, you can buy the core edition for very cheap.
---
It heals for a lot, but still is rather glassy if you get caught.
---
The sarcasm and tone of your comment means that it wasn’t actually a question. Don’t throw a rock and then hide your hand scrub :P
---
The thing with it in my opinion is that you can't get lazy. Spam people with what they have to do. Outposts are up? SPREAD AND DEFEND! Outposts down? ESCORT THE PACT SOLDIERS! Bosses coming soon? YOU TELL THOSE MFERS TO GET TO THE PACT ENCAPMENT WP AND KILL THE MATRIARCH THEN SPREAD! Thats the general recipe for a T4 in my experience.
---
Oh didnt know about that. That makes it a lot less painful :)

I’ve convinced several friends to join recently, and have had the same issues. They really should hand (and promote) a GW2 Complete Bundle with both expacs and all available LW episodes. All of my friends have ended up buying the expansions in the store, and getting the season packs independently with gems. 
---
Now that you made your point clear to me, here is my answer: I don't mind. A 5 man instanced content that is about dwarves or a tropical island does not matter to me. In the long run, the only thing that matters to me in the 5 man instanced content is the loot at the end.
---
Then again, I feel like I should disagree with your position to a certain extent for two reasons:
---
* No one cares about story in dungeons. They only care about the loot in the end. The more story content they cram in, the more annoying it is. They would have to balance out story and time it takes to finish dungeon. If you wanted to tell a story that is important to the lore, 5 man instanced content wouldn't do the story justice. Now, if it is in a single player story content, you have all the time to care, no one else is going to kick you for caring about the story. 
---
* Instanced content is meant to require more skilled play. If you made a dungeon that tells a story about whatever, people will miss out on it because there is a minimal skill cap. I missed out all the lore in raids because no group wants me in their group. Now, if the raid is in some tropical island that no one cares about, I wouldn't mind being left out in it.
---
I’m hoping so 🤞 
---
Really want a support class that is on par with Firebrands buffs, condi cleanse, and healing. 
---
When I was a total noob and didn't know any better I went full pistol whip spam build. Idk if there are more efficient ways to do it (well, it's a borderline meme build tbh) but what I did was take Deadly Arts 2-3-3 (mostly Mug and damage), Critical Strikes 3-2-3 (so far pretty much the core of any thief build) and finally Acrobatics 3-2-2. 
---
Let me break down what this does: when using pistol whip you stun one target and evade all attacks for a short period. Because of Invigorating Precision every crit heals. Evades trigger Upper Hand, Feline Grace and Swindler's Equilibrium (on a 5, 1 and 10 icd respectively), granting initiative, regeneration, vigor and recharging steal. More steal means more initiative + Mug wich is an on-demand heal, more initiative means more pistol whip which translates into more evades and vigor means even more evades on top of that. Pain response is a more reliable lifesaver than Instant Reflexes because however much you try you cannot evade condition ticks. If you want even more sustain you can add food that steals life on crit. If you want *even more sustain* you could replace Deadly Arts for Daredevil 2-2-3 or 2-3-3. 
---
Skills are to taste but I'd roll with Withdraw, haste and Infiltrator's Signet to stunbreak as much as possible. Withdraw provides one extra dodge and no casting time and haste almost ensures the next pistol whip connects. Daggerstorm is the ideal elite: stab, evades and reflects while hitting enough stuff to heal to full almost instantly.
---
Now, I have not tested this build extensively (as in, with different runes/sigils/stats) because it suffers from two major flaws: one, you will run out of initiative after 5 or 6 pistol whips and two, the short downtime between pistol whips leaves you vulnerable to stuns, interrupts and raw damage. 
---
Oh and it goes without saying, this is not viable for high end group content *at all*, it is a self-serving build and nothing else.
---
Ah phlunt, I wrote a whole lotta words again.
---
&gt; Even then, chances of something going for / finding such a random text file on your entire filesystem? Yeah, alright
---
But it's not a random text file and it's not the entire system. 
---
It's the GW2 shortcut and if you search only the desktop, you will find it on the most computers. 
---
However, not matter how hard it is to break in in reality, the risk is there. And it needs only one hacked account this way to make Anets costumer data security at least questionable.
---
I literally logged in to see what's new and 10 minutes later I logged off
---
You have a certain amount of time before it times out.  I've made it back to a spot before and gotten my bag.
---
Yes man, it is honestly annoying. it's usually from like 5pm onwards. Any activity whether it's pve or WvW, my ping just spikes every 10-20 seconds consistently, it makes me not want to play. It's the same situation as other people too, it's only GW2. 
---
What is that purple-edged thing in your shared #1?
---
yeah, because internet is completely safe, right? ;)
---
Chak Egg Sac.
---
Imo great Change.. Hope Material Prices will rise again a bit
---
Where are the Scourges??
---
I've only been playing a few months and... yeah current LA looks like a tacky tourist attraction. I'm not saying "pirate dumpster" would be better or worse - haven't seen much of that one - but everything now just looks like a gimmick you'd see by the side of the road somewhere.
---
Compare it to any racial capitol. The other major cities look functional and practical (mostly, the grove is not my favorite), but LA has squid bank, crab barrel tailoring station, giant glass starfish roofs (!??), a lobster dock for some reason and that other thing... what was it?
---
Burn me, it's a stingray.
---
Certainly the quality has gone up, but LS1 has a lot more to offer than just nostalgia. There's a gaping hole in the story currently, with a big conspiracy uniting unlikely allies against us, leading to the horrifying destruction of Lion's Arch at the hands of a mad genius sylvari, ultimately awakening a dragon that we hadn't even truly acknowledged previously.
---
That's pretty interesting stuff, even if the quality isn't up to today's standards.
---
And (I know I sound like a broken record with this point), I don't think nostalgia is the driving force behind people missing LS1. LS1 was a high-speed, intriguing ride where the world around us was actually at stake. Though it proved not to be sustainable, the time we spent with that first season was really impactful (if not for the quality, then definitely for the presentation).
---
Yes, Scourge.
---
She destroyed the best version of Lion's Arch and forced us to be stuck with the bad one. She deserves Hell.
---
I think I expressed myself a bit incomprehesibly. 
---
You can use the launcher (more precise, parts of the launcher) to handle multiaccount autologin easily. You can't do it with the original user interface, you are right at this point. 
---
Sorry for this misunderstanding.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tarrktun_Personal_Delivery_Portal
---
The-they don't sell a complete bundle on the store?
---
I swear, sometimes I feel ArenaNet hate money.
---
did you switch instances / leave the map after starting? if you end up in an instance where a room isn't part of the rotation it just drops its own plate
---
It’s odd because I never heard of them being a good support role. I know they can give barriers, but any buffs or healing?
---
Right now I feel FB is the only role that is a truly support role. Everything else is like a hybrid focusing more on DPS side of things. 
---
My other support I play is herald. I do love the 7k heals with the tablet, but very limited in terms of having to guess where players will be and the threshold percentage. 
---
Guess what I truly want is a support built around more buff duration and heals on par with FB. :)
---
Well you can also buy the living world episodes by converting gold to gems, but I get that that seems a high barrier for new players (and probably is).
---
Since those people/programs searching for login data and stuff, it *is* a part of your problem, yes.
---
Good point, I changed my post to make it a bit clearer.
---
It was totally worth it!
---
I wish I understood it, when it was going on, but I used it to get my first 80 so I can’t complain.
---
Rift was like this. well, i cant remember if it had multiple sets but you had your equipment slots and then your wardrobe slots, whatever you put in the wardrobe was what was displayed, with your stats still coming from your normal equipment
---
yeah, such a shame the devs didnt made an oversight on this one -\_-
---
Probably because that’s how most multi-component lootcrates work, ie Dota, CS:GO, TF2
---
Are you implying GW2's only redeeming quality is its QoL? Or are you building some ridiculous hypothetical game to prove a point?
---
I get where you're coming from, that GW2 can't possibly fill every gameplay craving, and the sheer quality of life in GW2 makes it hard to transition to other games, but that's hardly a (potentially) predatory practice like subscription fees can be. Add to the fact that GW2 doesn't have some cost for stepping away, and there really shouldn't be complaints that it spoils you with its QoL.
---
We should be encouraging other games to learn from each other's best points, not negatively twisting something good because it outshines other games.
---
A lot of stuff in the gem store is on rotation, so they go out of the gem store and back in at some later point. I guess they'll be available for valentine's day.
---
You could, actually.  Just make a character and then put the 20 slot bag in the bank.  Delete the character and rinse and repeat your way to infinite 20 slot bags.
---
Well yeah, that's the point. They are soulbound, so you can't do that.
---
You’re right! This is unrealistic body standards for boars! Let boars be boars!
---
I didn't know that, I guess it makes sense to do it this way if everyone else did it this way too.
---
He actually engineered a way to escape weeks ago but has become preoccupied with ways he could make it grander and more elaborate.
---
What he doesn't know is that the cage has been left unlocked.
---
wildstar too; wildstar had so many great features, RIP
---
The sandstorm one is nice also. Both cost 10,000 gold and 25,000 ectos each. I am a huge gambler so I of course had to get both. I use them daily with excess gold and ectos from salvaging. They really are a lot of fun if you have the means to acquire and use them. They also serve as personal merchants if you dont already have merchants saved up or the personal merchant express. 
---
To comment on the exact build. You want to run Critical Strikes with Invigorating Precision in the final slot. I personally also recommend running Trickery so you get buffs when you steal and Deadeye with Maleficent Seven, to get even more buffs and initiative.
---
For skills, just make sure to take Signet of Malice. I personally recommend running Assassin's Signet (for more power), Signet of Agility (for more precision), Roll for Initiative (for an evade and initiative gain), and Shadow Meld (to reset your malice).
---
Tell them they can buy living world episodes with in-game currency, that will take some of the edge off. Alternatively, they can read a summary of the story and not buy any living story at all. In my opinion, only a few living story episodes are worth it unless story is *really* important to you (Bloodstone Fen for countermagic, Bitterfrost Frontier for berry farm, Istan for gold farm, Kourna for beetle).
---
If I were you, I'd start them f2p to make sure they'll like the game. If they do, start them on an expac (help them choose which), then go from there. Also note that they can go through LS2 instances with you, though they won't get mastery points or achievements for it. 
---
They don't have to sink a bunch of money in up front. They can pay for content as they go.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPFU28vh5vY
---
It's a longbow thing. It's either safety or DPS. 
---
Or just run Sb^3 if you want safety and big deeps. 
---
technically they don't need the living world episodes
---
even with playing them they probably be lost with alot of the story parts and still lacking season 1 being replay able in a senseable way where you get the full story, the short recap is not explaining enough
---
either throw them straight to PoF, then have them get the newest living world episodes
---
PoF is GW2s best Story Arc so far in my opinion and they will unlock pretty much all the mounts and masteries by playing through PoF and have a good starting point to get through the older stuff if they then really want to see more
---
The Core Story is the worst of them all
---
Season 2 is meh anyway
---
HoT is mediocre
---
Season 3 is great
---
&gt; Someone is totally going to compromise peoples computers and look at our Guild Wars 2 short cuts
---
No matter how low the risk is, the risk is there. And the point is, that Anet is in charge to keep their provided functions safe. In this case it wasn't safe. It needs only one hacked account this way, to bring big trouble to Anet. 
---
&gt;but not like it has been over the past 6 years. 
---
To you, but you can't speak for all the other hundreds of thousands of players. Since they made this change after six years, they probably *had* some trouble with it. 
---
&gt;With that kind of security issue we shouldn't be allowed to even save log on information.
---
Saving your login data via launcher is a secure way, because it's encrypted, that's the difference. 
---
And if you save your login data in a txt file, you are responsible for it and any issues are your problem, not Anets. That's another difference. Anet provided this function, so they were in charge to make it safe. It wasn't safe so they removed it.
---
 * I was having a showdown with someone, both of us on even footing on a flat platform, stepping side-to-side and dodging here and there. I was getting "Obstructed" messages with every fireball I tossed despite them only side-stepping now and then with no wall/terrain between us, and meanwhile their fireballs were hitting me mid-evade. I died, they were still at ~90% health. This happened several times throughout playing. That, and despite my ping being low, people seemed to be rubberbanding (bouncing back to where they were, disappearing and reappearing, etc) all over. I couldn't keep track of targets because of it.
---
 * Once one team gained an advantage, it always became a steamroll. The game isn't fun when 3+ players have all collectible abilities and their respective enemy team keeps respawning with base fireball for 3+ minutes, whether you win or lose. Winning feels hollow, losing feels like it was pointless to stick around once the steamrolling started.
---
 * If they're going to tie dailies to a *PvP* event, when many in the playership loathe PvP/WvW, at *least* take the suggestion of making it a participation thing. Whenever "Daily Activity Participation" comes around, I roll my eyes, but deal, because win or lose, everyone involved gets credit. Heck in Crab Toss the other day, half the "players" sat in a corner while ~4 players actually played. There are two sets of PvP/WvW dailies wholly separate from PvE dailies for a reason, Anet. If you're going to have Lunar Festival dailies tied to a PvP activity, grant participation trophies. Not everyone wants in on the PvP action, but we can grin and bear a couple rounds if we aren't expected to also *win it*
---
What are your utility + elite skills? Having boons can make a significant difference and Ranger is very good at giving itself boons. 
---
Strength of the Pack is very strong solo, especially combined with Moa Stance (66% increased duration on boons granted). I'd take Dolyak Stance and Quickening Zephyr in addition to Moa Stance as your utilities - there you have two stun breaks, and a source of personal quickness if you so desire. 
---
Merge with Smokescale I'd say, but be careful not to use its F2 near  walls. For every strike the merged smokescale F2 gives might, which synergises well with Moa Stance. 
---
**"By the way, to catch up on the story from LS2 you'll have to farm up around ~ [1,200g](https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/gems?filter.conversion_type=goldToGems_gems&amp;filter.conversion_input=3480) or spend an extra $30.**"  
---
.. because that'll go over well to people that just dropped $30-40 on HoT/PoF to begin with. 
---
* LS1 ~ [lol just kidding.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d17gwV4vXOg&amp;t=45s) 
---
* LS2 ~ 1280 gems. 
---
* LS3 ~ 960 gems. 
---
* LS4 ~ 1200 gems. 
---
There's always a chance of discounts, and players can do LS2 with a friend since they aren't map restricted (Drytop/Silverwastes).  
---
We could use something like Caverns of Time in World of Warcraft. Where you can access old content in the form of dungeons or raids
---
Moa Stance, Dolyak Stance, Sic'em and Strenght of the pack. I get tons of buffs! But still slow :( Maybe I just got spoilt by reaper/mesmer speed.
---
Rodents of unusual size? I don't belive they exist.
---
I’ll check it out once I get home :)
---
Do you honestly think anyone would have an interest in engaging with someone who talks like you do? There's no benefit to conceding any points you make, because you haven't made any. You just disagree. So disagree and be gone.
---
what's sb3? Also what would be a better dps ranged weapon then? Shortbow/axe seem even worse
---
This, meanwhile the enemies were seemingly bouncing all over (yes I know about the steam launchers, but those are in set locations, and even then a player using one is suddenly rubberbanded back to where they started)
---
Throwing fireballs at enemies with no walls between us gives me "Obstructed" or "Out of Range" messages, when they're tossing from up on their starting platform at me with no issue. There's something seriously wrong serverside imo, I'm unsure why that's a constant and only in this one activity.
---
Selling the full bundle for $50-$60 would really simplify things, and still be a stellar deal. 
---
Hmm. That's odd then. Should be decently fast although tbh for open world stuff nothing much can beat Reaper sadly. 
---
Don't know I like the rants about wow. It's also intressting to read what's going on in other games.
---
everything
---
I didn't time it, but for comparison I can use the times it 'rotates' (I know it's silly). On reaper, the hydra can barely get to its second rotation before it's down. On ranger it can do up to 4 rotations...
---
You're welcome! I always use buy offers so I decided to add it for convenience!
---
I didn't make the first comment you quoted. I understand that you enjoy teaching others that you're a piece of shit deep down, but 
---
It's funny because when I played back on NA and had 140-200 ping, I had a better idea of what's going on than now when I'm on low ping and that makes no fucking sense whatsoever.
---
when I started playing the game years ago, probably about 2 weeks of just grinding and exploring -- the good thing is that everything in the game gives you XP, so as a newer player, you just have to play -- explore, do quests/events, kill mobs, gather...all you gotta do is play (however you want to), and you'll start leveling up fast.
---
I remember in the beginning I just spent some money on gems, turned it to gold, and just maxed out all my crafting skills as a super fast way to level up. :p 
---
&gt; I feel FB is the only role that is truly support
---
&gt; my other support I play is herald
---
You desperately need to do some serious research.
---
Support herald is pretty underappreciated. Credit where it's due, many people miss that one.
---
Support FB is solid, absolutely treasured in WvW zergs.
---
Tempests are designed for support. With auras, overloads, and boons coming out of their ears, they're great.
---
Druid is one of the most efficient healers in the game. If you see a build for one and think "oh, they're using too much damage to be a good healer," no. That's wrong. Druids heal efficiently enough that gearing them entirely toward healing is typically overkill, so yes they aim for damage too. Plus they have a ton of party buffs.
---
Chronomancer, the light armor spec that can tank. They're all about boons. It has been a regular chore for ANet to keep them from completely dominating the meta as support.
---
Scrapper even has support and healing. I've never tried it but it's a thing.
---
Scourge went underappreciated for a while, but it was discovered a bit ago just how valuable they are if you know what you're doing with it.
---
There are only like two professions that lack good builds for support and healing: thief and warrior. But who knows? LS5 might change that.
---
[Here's a build guide, updated regularly](https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki). They include plenty of descriptions on how to use each build properly.
---
I understand this. I've been with GW2 since beta weekend 2. But leaving my druid behind in WoW, leaving my Anzu mount behind (that took me a year to get), was very painful.
---
It is as painful as it'd be leaving GW2 now that I have a legendary weapon.
---
These days you can't fail bosses in story chaps anyways. If you die you just instantly respawn with all your previous progress intact. 
---
Season 1 marionette was the best.  :(   Priceless.  
---
So I've never reached max lvl in this game stopping at lvl 30 in the past. I started a new character last night and am having a lot of fun with the class. I noticed I have a lvl 80 boost in my bag, for someone who has never naturally leveled to 80 is it better for me to lvl up naturally or will I not miss much knowledge/experience wise by using the boost? 
---
Longbow just doesn't do much damage for Ranger.  It is what it is.  They don't really have a better Power option for ranged damage, with Axe and Shortbow both being Condition Damage focused weapons.
---
Probably best to use your Greatsword more.  You're using Hydras as an example, and they're pretty safe to melee as you can move behind them to avoid their bites, charge and fire breath, and just moving period will dodge the meteors.  Just in case you haven't done it yet, make sure you turn off "Melee Attack Assist" in the game's options, which prevents you from walking through enemies.  Walking through enemies is one of the quickest ways to get out of reach of their frontal attacks to safe spots behind them to smack them around.
---
A SoulBeast using a ShortBow and also another ShortBow.
---
And it's only in this game mode. I'm fine in open world, fine in instanced content like Story Instances, fine in Fractals, fine in large groups like Silverwastes Meta. Further I don't think it's a seasonal activity issue, either, as I was fine in the Snowball Mayhem game and jumping puzzle just a couple weeks back during Wintersday.
---
But this gamemode is tossing "Obstructed" and "Out of Range" messages at me 4/5 fireballs I toss.
---
Except there's no way that's a bench.
---
As a supporter and patreon, thank you so much for the time and energy you have both put into LaunchBuddy, it's been essential for my day to day play since I discovered it.
---
I'm sad to see it end for now but I totally understand why and I believe its perfectly justified given the horrid timing of it all.
---
Good luck in your future projects! Hopefully they'll still be GW2 related despite this. 
---
same.
---
Next raid.
---
Don't be afraid to mess around with different classes! They all have their own quirks. I believe you can also test out every specialization and skill (which can be kinda really overwhelming) in the PvP lobby before you've unlocked it! (If you still have a free-to-play account, though, you probably won't be able to try out elite specs. Also, there *are* slight differences between the open-world and PvP versions of some skills.) I'd also encourage you to mess around with different skills and weapons as you level, so you can really learn your class.
---
If you don't have the expansions yet, don't bother buying them until you hit level 80 or until there's a good sale. You can't use any of the expansions until you hit level 80.
---
If you do have the expansions, don't use a level 80 boost yet- leveling a character to 80 via exploration and events is a much better way to learn both the layout of the world and your skills. 
---
But most of all, have fun!
---
Curious to see what you think after you did it yourself. You're the emperor of istan farmerama afterall.
---
RIP Tower of Nightmares, loved climbing that tower with random people. They ought to revisit that concept again.
---
I would love wardrobe templates. I hope if they do it we also get the possibility to assign certain regions certain templates. I know it's sound weird but hear me out. 
---
I believe they already have those "regions" set and available to them. For example when the map unfogs. 
---
Basically take those assigned regions and let us decide what outfit template we would like to show. It could open the world map and we could select whole maps or certain regions in those maps. That way I could create a fur heavy outfit for snowy areas, assign something lighter for the desert or create something more ornate for cities. 
---
I obviously don't know how much work it would be in the end but I do think it's technically not impossible. 
---
Not to mention if people just buy the expansions and don't even know about the living world updates, they could just go with the content they have and be totally confused as to what's going on.  In every other MMO you just buy the expansion and can get started on it.  There's typically not something in between that needs to also be bought or done first.
---
Unpopular opinion: Season 1 was garbage, and Scarlet was a poorly written antagonist that existed purely for the sake of having an antagonist.  
---
That said, I feel like its absence is unfortunate, as it leaves newcomers at a loss for what happened in that time. I hope they bring it back for their sake. 
---
Not true. 
---
But why to have it as first bag? I personally have invisible bags at the end of inventory, so new loot is not dropping into them. First bags are for new items you loot, middle bags for consumables, last bags for items you carry around and don't want to lose/deal with. Having it mixed all together in your setup would make me insane probably :D

It’s garbage. 
---
Happened for a while now - sadly.
---
No WvW server that you describe can exist at this point. If it exists, there's thousands of players that want to go there. And then suddenly, it doesn't exist anymore. 
---
WvW servers and group play relies on communities, and GW2 is a casual game.
---
You have virtually no ferocity. You crits hit like wet noodles.
---
Thankfully, yes. But I was mainly getting at the dungeons here.
---
That's a connection issue. Try to reset your router.
---
I played through most of it.  I think it suffered by not being in the current episodic format, despite the benefits gained by so much of the repeatable content being open world.  Things took so long to happen because they didn't have the time to put a lot of story content in at once like they do now (about 3-4 months for 2 releases that update the open world compared to the current 9-ish months for an episode/map), so they had to have these frequent recaps as it neared the end to remind players what happened as the story crawled along, and the writing suffered accordingly.  The every-2-week releases added to the Living World feeling, but also contributed to a lot of burnout trying to keep up.
---
Personally, I liked Season 1, despite its flaws.  However, it was made in the first year of release and it'd be a huge amount of work to update and recreate it.  It'd probably be about the same amount of effort to basically redo it properly.
---
About the best you're going to get is if they officially break all the 26ish releases into episodes and give you a recap per episode.  Granted, that'd be worlds better than now, anyway.
---
Or an enterprising player could maybe create a basic game that goes through the storyline so players could experience it in some form.
---
This is exactly it.  
---
Season 1 Scarlet felt like they invented a nutty antagonist for the sake of having an antagonist. There was no motive. Her "wackiness" was more obnoxious than it was quirky. It was just awful writing.  
---
Season 2 Scarlet was them realizing how bland and awful she was, and retconed in a backstory to make her seem more interesting. 
---
this makes no sense.
---
you are optimizing for graphical quality vs video memory usage. video memory usage is pretty meaningless, since as long as you have enough, it doesn't matter if you are using 1% memory or 95% memory.
---
what you SHOULD be optimizing is graphical quality vs performance.
---
Have them start with the Expansion storyline chapters that come with them - that will give them a taste for how GW2 presents story-based content on top of things like Open World events, dungeons, raids, etc. As they learn the game and play through that content, they’ll begin amassing new Living World chapters - all you need to do is log on while a chapter is ‘active’ and it’s added to their library for later play at any point. Once they’re sold on the quality of the story-based stuff, they can start unlocking past chapters with gems, which as others have pointed out can be obtained either by exchanging gold (play-based in-game currency) for gems (real-money virtual currency). 
---
Odds are that they’ll start buying at least SOME gems once they get hooked on the game, since ANet is always offering specials and sales on all kinds of cosmetics and QOL tweaks, as well as to (hopefully) support the dev team directly for their quality work. 
---
Replace moa stance with signet of the wild, dolyak with vulture stance, Greatsword.Sword/Axe
---
I don't have multiple accounts, not did I read this. It's a wall of text that if it works, thank you on behalf of people I don't know.
---
Use the GS's full kit!  The stun refreshes the cooldown of maul, leap into start combat.  GS does a lot of burst damage and will kill middling mobs pretty easily.
---
sorry, by 212 ferocity I actually meant the % damage increase, not the actual stat. Meaning 212% crit dmg

The jump to 80 is hard unless you played the game. expac zones are much harder than core and you wont understand the mechanics. 
---
Leveling at least 1 char to 80 should be necessary before being able to boost IMO. Its basically a tutorial. 
---
I use this build on my Ranger, LB variant with the dagger and warhorn. https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Soulbeast_-_Boon_Berserker 
---
I want to be ranged and find this pretty effective, stack boons at the start of combat and wail away. I don't really like the gs gameplay on ranger but dagger is pretty cool and you dance about like you're raving.
---
Weapons in GW2 aren't created equally because they're designed for both PvE &amp; PvP.  Some weapons are more PvP oriented and some are more PvE oriented.  PvP based weapons usually have strong front-loaded burst like LB2 (Barrage) and poor sustained damage. PvE oriented weapons usually have high burst skills and strong sustained damage "fillers" and auto-attack chains.  
---
I'd recommend looking up a Power Soulbeast build with Sword/Axe + Greatsword.  The rotation isn't too difficult to understand and you can find it at either Snowcrows, Discretize or Metabattle.  The gist of it is that the base damage values and scaling on whirling axe blow barrage out of the water; there's no comparison what-so-ever, but it is melee and immobile (animation-locked).  However, you'll do much, much more damage in a vacuum and in shorter damage intervals.  
---
Your weapons, traits, runes, sigils and stats all need to synergize to get the most out of a build.  Your rotations also can't be weak so it pays to skim over a min/maxed rotation for Fractals or Raids even for casual open world content.  You don't have to worry too much about looping it since stuff dies pretty quickly, but learn the first ~ 30-45 seconds of a stronger rotation and you'll benefit greatly.

Commanders have no obligation to lead for you. If they prefer to lead piken (which is far from a stacked / bandwagoned server) over GH, what does that say about GH? Perhaps -just maybe- they simply didn't want to put up with the pugs they'd been with anymore?
---
Perhaps the community wasn't as great for them as it was for you? I mean, if it was that great and fun for them, why leave? 
---
And how exactly do you plan on having anet create more leads? If you get them, then piken doesn't. Either way someone's going to be stuck on a dead server. Is it possible there's lots of pugs, no commanders, no new commanders can possibly ever be trained and the entire system isn't sustainable for \*magic reasons\* that have nothing to do with stacking?
---
Is it perhaps possible that stacking is a symptom of WvW being fucked; and not the reason WvW is fucked? ;) 
---
Just slapped myself right in the face. I've been doing skin unlocks of low karma gear, for Guaranteed Unlock purposes, and I've legit just been throwing them away after getting the skin. Totally forgot about Mystic Toilet, and definitely haven't even been looking at Charms. 
---
Thanks for the reminder!
---
This, so much this. If you're addicted to lootboxes, the issue is in your head and you should seek professional help. Destroying the practice is not going to solve the problem. Should we also block the sun so people with photophobia don't have to suffer?
---
Those solutions do not work any longer.
---
I carry around a lot of stuff like extra armour sets, extra weapons, consumables and a huge amount of WvW siege so the first few bags are fairly static. I'm also a monster and use the compact inventory D:
---
Yea, they don't work. I'm not sure they even worked over three years ago when those posts were made.
---
Tell them that A) you don't need to buy it all at once, B) you can play the entire base game for free, and C) everything currently available costs less than six months of WoW subscription, if my math is correct. It really isn't that expensive at the end of the day, only slightly more so than most full-priced games, so if that doesn't win them over nothing will.
---
As long as it doesn't have to cost gems. 1200 gems is already $15 USD. That's dlc price for other games but in GW2 its for a quality of life feature.
---
I use this for fractals. Absolutely melts pve. 
---
https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/soulbeast/power/
---
Mostly when you use the F3 impact skill, elite wolf and sic 'em + axe 5. Crazy burst. 
---
Sword has couple evades. So does greatsword. 
---
Also its basically full zerker with 1 or 2 assassins for crit but not necessary 
---
Also use your spirits like stone for -33% damage. Dolyak stance is nice to reduce damage as well
---
thanks a lot for the information !
---
I wish we had the same functionality in the TP UI...
---
Those passwords are also not visible to other process on the computer like the one in command line argument were but I guess you don't want facts and thoughtful discussion but only make drama.
---
Any class can do all of that. Team buffs and offensive/defensive debuff is present in all classes, but no classes really focus on debuffing, since all classes can do it, theres no utility of focusing on it, you just loose dps for no real gain. 
---
Support is definetly doable, mesmer is one of the best classes to bring boons to allies and provide support. Ranger is great at it too with druid, so is tempest ele and warrior with banners. Necro is probably the class with the least group support. 
---
In gw2, all classes can basically fo anything. All can "tank"(theres no facetanking lke it other mmos, its all about active defense and damage mitigation), support and dps, some just do some better. 
---
What classes are you interested? If its all of them just google, would be too long to explain all the classes when they are all described and analysed on the internet, but if you have a few youre interested in, maybe I could give you details about them, I play all classes. 
---
You can. Just move to Dubai and be rich. You can even get people minis. 
---
I don't want to pay for it, though, I'd rather keep earning shards for free on characters and transforming each piece one by one (even though that's annoying). 
---
If there is a system for this, it should be an optional extra system (along with the default shard system).
---
I kind of like transforming pieces and mixing them up like I do now (wearing different pieces as I like), but if this system was an additional system, then I wouldn't mind it.
---
also, happy cake day dude !
---
:-)
---
Thanks for the advice! I decided to make a Mesmer.
---
I mean, Asura *existed* during GW1...
---
Well, it's a fantasy game.
---
I agree. I can't understand how people see her character as anything beyond one-dimensional. 
---
The axe 5 is static and short range though right? Meaning you gotta stack enemies first and pop a stability?
---
Delet this
---
All because that one guy disagreed slightly with Price. They won't be missed
---
n o
---
The healing signet plus that trait means you can regenerate health faster than you lose it.  It's silly.  I take it for open world with be quick or be dead and collateral damage.  Mark,  burst, target explodes hurting and blinding other mobs.  Remark,  repeat.  Repeat.  Repeat.  Add shadow flare for extra aoe damage.
---
Condition damage focused.
---
That sounds pretty baller. There's a 16x stack i can buy and re-sell for instant profit? I need to look into that.
---
You're right, they're not intended to be done solo.
---
But they are still very doable even by the average player. I am like you, and the only content I didn't solo are raids.  
---
I even soloed the guild hall claiming, it's doable if you build for it.
---
But I understand your point perfectly. Wanting solo contend doesn't mean to create solo content for yourself where there isn't any (because it entails things like long time, hard challenges, hp sponges, etc. and someone may not like that at all).
---
Low level fractals are the most balanced option IMO, the right level of challenge without incredibly big hp sponges.  
---
Still think it was a bit much to sac him for what happend, but a statement is a statement.

Glad to see he's still kicking (in a good way).

11-13 VM per chest is a nerf ... looting all chests should  be closer to 1000 VM
---
So it is actually a 40% nerf on top of whatever other change they did?
---
It's a bit confusing but yeah, it's due to the cover usually being the patch countdown from /u/ thatshaman
---
Just a bit lazy and cba to uncover it
---
well thats you main issue right there youre just afk auto attacking instead of actually using abilities
---
I forgot that this place is full of combative technology-illiterate fanboys like yourself. If you manage to smuggle a process that can "read out" someone's files onto their PC, you can just copy his Firefox/Chrome Appdata folder and happily own all his shit. I know that because I did it to my own remote computer once. Of course, you already lost me at "Appdata" because your expertise barely covers how to setup Wifi.
---
Engaging in discussions with morons is a waste of time.
---
I was playing with it last night and it works great.
---
It does the same thing as launch buddy, but is more flexible.
---
It's all just buried in the menu's - I missed a bunch of things first time I played around with it.
---
You do have to set it to create a new.dat file (not the 40gb thing) and also set it to generate a new graphics setting file for each of the  accounts (or if the settings are the same then just make one for the first account and then it has the option to just use the one file for all).
---
The first time you run each new account it suggests to run 'normally' - do this. You can set the graphics manually for each account in game, and then the program takes over after that - although it has an option to run it 'normally' at any time.
---
From what I was seeing it pretty much does what launch buddy does, and more.
---
Don't think it lets you pick the servers though.
---

I didn't know rip, still a good PSA bc I've had it happen 3 times after this patch

I just about fell out of my chair when I got them first chest I opened. Sorry mate.

that's how they buff chronos in the last patch!

Yup there are and will be more 3rd party solutions that do it all for you. Here I describe the "manual" method.
---
you can still multibox but logging in alts takes much more effort where before it was a one button action

"...don't expect me to pretend to like you here" - A rando asshat
---
tried light night and rifle still dosent work for me
---
This isn't confirmed but I assume, if he wasn't fire  the femi-nazis would be mad, and good chance of Jessica to sue Anet. She was clearly not afraid to pull out the gender card whenever possible. 
---
This is further backed up by the fact that in all interviews and articles about and with her, Peter Fries wasn't mentioned either at all or much, all because it goes against the "Anet isn't a safe space for woman" narrative. If he wasn't fired, his name would have been brought up and compared.
---
Pretty sure most of the community did not want to see Peter leave. Most expected an apology at worst.
---
He still comes up when you google search "rando asshat", he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Shouldn't have opened twitter that day.
---
I am in the exact same boat as you.
---
That's why I said if it's a 2FA issue you have to contact support; they'll be able to remove it for you. You can submit an anonymous ticket, but you have to provide them with as much information as you know. The more you give the faster they can help, it takes longer when they have to investigate to confirm account ownership. Also make sure you provide the original email and one they can reach you at.
---
I'm already using a password manager for a bunch of other stuff so it does not change much tbh (it's like 2-4 button action depending hwo you count actions).
---
Adding more of your crash log would be useful. A memory address like that can be about 20 different things.
---
And yet repeatedly its for **my** machine and to use the category for your stuff; which I suspect would be FPS. Even so you are still focusing on shifts of Quality &amp; Number.
---
I’m so poor and they just needed istan farm lol maybe once I make enough money irl then I can just convert gems lol
---
I use 3 or 4 accounts regularly, but I manually enter most of my login credentials to get in (used to use a batch file, but haven't gotten around to setting it up again on a new rig.)
---
So - I have multiple accounts, but the change doesn't affect me at all.
---
The idea of a fully living world is awesome and I wouldn't even mind that I missed some of it, because it would be like a real history of the world. The real problem behind it is that ArenaNet would be creating a ton of content that would never be monetized, as opposed to having everyone purchase previous LW segments they missed now. It makes business sense since GW2 is not a sub game, but it's kind of disappointing we missed out on a cool mechanic. 
---
You could play a ranger. They have access to long- and shortbows in addition to a pet, and are a fairly easy class to learn.
---
Festival vendor in the Crown Pavillion, just west of the waypoint.  The same spot the Wintersday vendor was.  Buy 16 of the Divine Lucky Envelopes at 1 gold each, flip them on the Trading Post for profit.  Do that every day and enjoy your easy earnings!
---
They're not super cheap on the store but you get loads doing map completion.  There's definitely ways to get them without buying.
---
You deserve a lot of kudos for this. I cannot play without the mount radial menu, it's the best gw2 add on and works side by side with Arc &amp; GW2Hook! 
---
I can't wait to try the novelty menu when I get home!
---
Season 1 was some of the most epic game play I've enjoyed in an MMO. The community had to come together against very challenging obstacles. The Living World was just that. Maps changed and grew and died. It was the most original and courageous thing that I've seen an MMO developer attempt and while the story itself wasn't always amazing, it at least felt epic in scope.
---
I've enjoyed each episode of the other seasons, but they're small. They're private. They're just me (and occasionally a guild mate). They are static. They are not epic.
---
New players were upset that they missed out on stuff. I understand that, but the upside was that there was always going to be a new thing just around the corner. Personally, I would gladly trade some missed events for the possibility of sweeping and unknown changes coming through the world and maps being reinvented and reinvigorated on a regular basis. 
---
Welcome to the game!
---
Gonna drop this obligatory link here which should give you a good idea of how each class plays.
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:What_Profession_Should_I_Play
---
Beyond just not being monetized, they'd be creating a ton of content that gets used for 2-4 weeks before being thrown away. It's a fairly wasteful way to spend development effort
---
Teehee. Pipe organ.
---
Oh wow, I never noticed! Too bad they're not a ranger pet anymore. Had one for the longest time. 
---
You'll notice it's no longer referred to as the "Living World," but the "Living Story." 
---
It plays out in chapters exactly how a story would be. Imo this is a better method of story telling for MMOs because it ensures new players have a cohesive narrative. But, I still wish they would implement open world events that go along with the instanced content. Look LS2, there were updates that also included dynamic events like those in Blazeridge(?). Those events are still there, but there's no reason they can't be removed without harming the story.
---
Are you really recommending a Heart of Thorns stat set for open world? I'd take suboptimal Valk gear that costs like 5g for a full set over Marauders that costs five times as much.
---
I always get downvotes when I've said this in the past. I still stand by that suggestion though.
---
3 fiddy
---
I love you
---
Don't get it wet either
---
You can resize the menu using the bottom-right triangle thing, but the font size is fixed.
---
It's difficult to give a fuck about NPCs if you haven't witnessed the beginning of their story.
---
Oh gosh, I miss the Marinette event. I wish they'd turn it into another schedule event like Triple Trouble or Tequatl.
---
Awesome! I haven't used this in a while, I think at some point I reinstalled the game and just forgot to reinstall your extension. I've recently bound one of the novelty hotkeys to a mouse button and it was really hard to decide which one so this is great timing!
---
I have the Eir Stegalkin version of that art tattooed on my arm. Love it. 
---
&gt; and in both cases you are only there to bring banner of strength and banner of discipline for the party
---
This is why I stopped playing instanced PvE on my Berserker. Tired of having to use Banners on my bar for 6 years straight. 
---
Why does Anet insist on making the most boring and noninteractive skills and traits so damn good for DPS? 10% damage modifier traits and passive unique damage buffs are so boring to play with.
---
And why no one bought it yet?
---
Where else would you sell an Asura in a cage?
---
On second thought, maybe I misunderstood you question. Just to cover that, too:
---
It would probably run away without the cage.
---
When I chainload this with ArcDPS and ArcDPS Build Templates, I get a white screen. I can try this when I get home and see if it works with the new update. 
---
And I imagine it's just not very satisfying for the devs after the novelty wears off.
---
Master has presented Dobby with a sock! Dobby is free!
---
Because i play in GH i can tell you that we lost most of our population and guilds after the week against RoS.
---
 First week was fine and everyone was happy with link but after the RoS blobs trampling us with numbers, they thought it is useless to stay in a low population link (dunno what anet was thinking making us main server and giving us another low population server).
---
One suggestion I received from /u/Monkeybtm6 was to allow more radial menus for different things, and I figured the best way to do so would be to outright allow for custom radial menus, so that's my main feature for the next update (1.2).
---
The hope is that you'll be able to create your own menu(s) using either your choice of icons or just text, and also be able to share those menus in a convenient format. They'll all work the same way the default ones do, just more flexible. As long as something has a keybind, it should be usable in a radial menu.
---
I agree. I was lucky enough to have played through all of the living world as it came out except for the very first event. I think I was on vacation during that time or something. 
---
LB is shit, trying to play LB ranger in solo PvE made me drop the game for the entirety of 1st LW season.
---
It's only after I've gone shortbow/axe+torch that I've started enjoying the class. Both warrior and guardian feel better with longbow than a fucking *ranger*.
---
I do test with arcdps successfully, but I haven't used the build templates because I don't 100% trust that. Make sure you chainload in [the recommended way](https://github.com/Friendly0Fire/GW2Radial#q-i-want-to-load-up-arcdpsgw2hooksomething-else-which-also-needs-to-be-called-d3d9dll-how-do-i-load-both).
---
You can try to log in the gw2 website, that way you'll be sure that your credentials are good
---
Praise the holy circle! Thanks so much for your hard work!
---
Did you use the following set up? It works perfectly for me
---
ArcDPS is named d3d9.dll
---
GW2Radial is named d3d9_chainload.dll
---
GW2Hook is named ReShade64.dll
---
Build Templates &amp; ArcDPS extras don't need to be renamed. 
---
Burnt to the ground Lion's Arch was great. It split the playerbase out into three hubs instead of just one central place, one at Fort Marriner, one near the Priory, and one near the Tengu wall, and all three hubs were pretty cool in their own destroyed ways.
---
LB isn’t gone for good. ;)
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/7190/failed-to-resolve-aimik-bone-indices
---
No solid solution, but could be: 
---
1. Malwarebytes (or other security software).
---
2. Window resizing tool.
---
3. Command line arguments, e.g. -mapLoadinfo.
---
I would also recommend disabling as many programs you have running in the background to isolate if there are any conflicts there. 
---
The old version works with ArcDPS chain loaded with Build Templates and GW2Hook, already.

3 that I actually play.
---
My main account, my EU PvP account, and my bank and guild storage account.
---
I set up my email and password similar but different, so I can swap between them pretty quick. E.g.. main account is enail@gmail.com, EU is email+EU@gmail.com, etc. The plus sign is just an alias.

In other words, you realised you can't name a point I misinterpreted because you didn't make any points, and you keep dodging the questions because you can't answer them.
---
You're not fooling anyone with the angry bluster.
---
Maul-&gt;Hilt Bash-&gt;Maul under the effects of Sic 'Em will basically just annihilate any open world trash. Bonus points if you merge with an electric wyvern and use the third skill to pull entire packs together.
---
Nice!

I struggle with my tablet. Its throws me off when I can't see what I'm drawing directly. 
---
It might come back during valentines day
---
&gt; Are you implying GW2's only redeeming quality is its QoL? Or are you building some ridiculous hypothetical game to prove a point?
---
Neither.
---
I won't be going super in depth cause it would be a bunch of boring technical stuff, but I will explain the issue and how clues from the community helped me solve it.
---
Detonate Plasma still doesn't contain Alacrity
---
Yes this is exactly what was supposed to happen, it unlocks one skin that you haven't unlocked yet.
---
You're new to WvW yet here you are telling me howmuch better you are than all the guilds that are so bad. Yet your open commanders, where are they?
---
The only ones that repeatedly look for an easy way out are the pugs who jump to whatever comm provides them with bags while pampering their ego's; then cry wolf the moment their server collapses. 
---
If the pugs are good and the guilds are bad, why did GH die completely the moment the guilds left? 
---
I find a lot of success in my DPS if I stay almost constantly merged with my pet, get some pretty insane damage. I also use sword/axe instead of LB most of the time for whirling defense. Otherwise I just stay in GS, most of the time I can take a hit or 2 so not worried about being punished at melee range.
---
living story season 2 has a good bunch of core tyria mastery points (16 of the 82). you only need 49 total to finish all the core tyria masteries, but they're there if it helps

Are the cds reset on the other shortbow or something?
---
Any screenshots for those on mobile? 
---
Just to clarify, neither handed axe are condition damage based.
---
do every hot meta once or at least loot AB after the chests are unlocked
---
Generally speaking, the reason character model limits have to be set relatively low has nothing to do with the GPU (or the VRAM) and everything to do with the CPU. The more character models are on screen, the longer the main engine loop takes to run. This very quickly starts to impact FPS, since the engine can't even calculate positioning for the next frame before it needs to render.
---
Frame rendering in and of itself is a comparatively microscopic part of GW2's overhead. I already have armor quality set to the max, and I could easily set character limit to highest without my GPU even breaking a sweat. However, my FPS at that setting would be horrific because my CPU would be unable to keep up.
---
Ultimately, clockspeed is the limiting factor on GW2's performance, not memory (of either type) and not the GPU.

Imagine Guildwars 2 charging $15 per month LOL. Also, the stories are free if you log in while they're the latest release ;)
---
as you play through the personal story there are a lot of instances in old LA
---
I know the Order of Whispers has one after Claw Island where you have to clear out a bunch of Risen in LA
---
I don't really think that it's a universal statement that thieves are not beginner-friendly. They lack cleave on the core spec early on, but they are meant to fulfill a specific one on one brawler or extremely niche team support role so they don't have the same tools as other classes. However, with traits like Invigorating Precision, Signet Of Malice, tons of dodges, teleports, and stealth, Thiefs can actually be very forgiving while still pumping out considerable damage and even avoiding attacks while doing so (Sword, Double dagger, etc). Their defensive mechanics are just generally different than the more active defenses of Guardian, for example.   
---
That doesn't make the class itself and its' design fundamentally beginner-unfriendly. Thief, for example, can build for a lot more innate survivability and mobility than classes with lower armor rating like Necromancer or Elementalist who round out their profession-specific weaknesses with other mechanical strengths. We should separate what constitutes beginner-unfriendly with a different play style approaches to survivability. The innate play style differences don't make the Thief beginner unfriendly by design as they have innate traits and weapon sets that arguably make them more survivable than Warrior or Guardian in specific situations where the Thiefs strengths (Mobility, Stealth, Evades) make a mechanical difference.
---
Is it worth doing season 2? I just looked and it seems I have to buy it with gems but it says I only get to episode 6 due to account limits (I think I have episode 7 unlocked for some reason).
---
This would cost me 960 gems which would mean spending 17 quid.
---
Seems a little steep?
---
During "Repel Invading Branded" northern meta in Thunderhead Peaks, Dragonsblood Spear can be pick up only by one person at the time which is really annoying - esp. during boss spawn. This bundle should work like preceeding Mines - upon getting close, special action key is getting activated, no interaction necessary.
---
I still wouldn't call that odd. My first char was ele, far from beginner friendly considering how squishy they are. Still not odd.
---
In GW1, yes. 
---
It is what happened to a few old accounts when the whole @ncsoft email login was abandoned. I had to email support to get my user name changed from the API looking code and it still glitches out in things like scoreboards.
---
2g* (1g from the boss chest and 1g from the exotic bouncy chest)
---
If the longbow appears in store you can buy it and ask support to refund half the gyms. Worked for me. 
---
i dont know the difference between f2p and b2p, i already have the old b2p account, what is the problem if i get something from paying the old game? lol
---
thanks!
---
Fair enough, I guess I misinterpreted what you meant. ;P The features have actually only grown over the past yearish, so it might be worth it to check out again in the future.
---
As for the security aspect and account creds in general, there are alternatives that LB didn't use because of problems that relate to them. They are either a ToS grey area (think logging in with a macro), or they are prone to problems (the local.dat solution has a few actually). Were just working with what we had access to, which was pretty limited and is more so now.
---
We will come back from this, it was initially a blow to morale but now I think it's just a fire under our asses to overcome the challenge.
---
OOF, why you gotta do this to me chaos
---
Celestial Tiger jackal
---
Celestial Hare Springer

Celestial Dragon Griphon

Celestial... Horse? Rat? Monkey? What would the last one be?
---
initially yes id get more gold from gems, but think of it this way, depending on the market, you can get around 50g or so a month from daily logins, eventually the account will generate more then the gems i would of bought and from that point on it generates gold endlessly, way i do it now is, i have all accounts have a character standing at a guild bank and all members of my persoanl guild bank, they deposit there crafting materials and mystic coins when they come and stack there laurels for later, every 3 months when we get a new living world episode, i unload the laurels into what ever is giving the most for them at the time and then i have enough to buy what i want off the gemstore, most times i have alot left over and it stacks, its a nice way to enjoy the game without ever having to worry about having gold for things you want
---
I don't know the direct3d pipeline that well, just changed and restored some jmp's in the game that looked like they were part of rendering.
---
https://i.imgur.com/4eA4Zdd.jpg is what I get on a very basic ViewAdvance (main thread) loop counter while looking at the lowest fps I can find in LA - same view until ~462 when I alt tab/minimize in true fullscreen, and then tab back in at ~485 where the drop happens. Looking at the floor at that same spot active and minimized fps are more or less the same. Not sure what state the d3d adapter is in when the game is minimized but drawn fps has never exceeded ViewAdvance
---
Oh, lol. Your comment made me think there was a launcher I didn't know about out there, and I wanted to check out the competition. ;P
---
tp flipping 😎
---
With all the other stuff they make money off of, they should 100% include story updates with whatever expansion you buy.  Imagine yourself as a new player and spending ~$50 on PoF and HoT and then also having to spend an additional ~$30 for more story updates.  It's bad, and I'm saying this as an avid fan of the game who's gotten them all for free.
---
New players should get access to the LS episodes relevant to whatever expansion it took place during when they buy that expansion.  Plain and simple.  Of all the issues listed by my friends (some of which are current or ex WoW players) who I've asked to play the game - this is the biggest reason they won't consider it.
---
Its not pet shop, its fresh food meat shop. My charr come here for fresh asuras in case when Rata Sum  restaurant Kindergarten is closed.
---
You already got the game and played it before it went free. That's your reward.
---
What I do daily:
---
At reset: VB boss kill for the hero chest (choose gemstone) -&gt; same for TD meta, oil meta in Thunderhead (sell lower plate), loot 1 of the huge chests in AB. Maybe DS if I'm in the mood (usually not). 
---
Fractal Daily + Rec, Teq, daily ascended crafting
---
3 gemstones + plate are around 8-9g, asc crafting around 5-7g (depending on what I craft), fractals (t4) around 20g+, teq 2g...
---
The go SW if you want to farm and daily Istan.
---
I believe in you guys! I don't envy your position in the slightest, but I wish you all the luck in the world if you choose to go forward with trying to develop something! :D
---
For some armor sets it unlocks all skins from the same weight
---
&gt;seem  
---
Why would they add 2 items that don't do anything?
---
You are right, the hybrid dog/pig is a dog's version of Motel Hell. 
---
I like many, missed it (took a stupid break and have been playing ever since season 2) and really wish to  play it.
---
* I wish I could meet our DW members properly
---
* I wish I could experience the epicness of escape and battle of LA
---
* I wish I could see the story of a funny golem who ironically became one of my fav characters
---
* I wish I could get the Season 1 AP and unique skins/rewards
---
* I wish I could play the whole story of gw2 core seasons 1-4(5) and so far 2 expansions as a complete game when I try a new class
---
It seems that using Fireworks while on a mount doesn't count for the Achievement: https://my.mixtape.moe/utbgtj.png
---
When I got off my mount I had the bundle, used it, and only have 1/88, but you can clearly see I have used more than that due to the Firework XP buffs I have.
---
Poor bunny :(
---
Making content that is only available for a short amount of time WAS the dumb decision.
---
thanks for the explanations :)  
---
yeah, just did a stack.  "free" gold, but holy hell is that not worth it :P can't even rapid-click a sell button. did get to offload all my legendary luck, but not gonna do exotic.
---
Would be great if you show a page of example.
---
no, but using two shortbows allows for things that activate on weapon swap
---
I'm talking about this one: https://github.com/Healix/Gw2Launcher
---
I dont know why would ppl complain here. If anything this mode is balanced and takes some skill and co op to win, so much not like pvp :). 
---
Ps. 
---
No mesmers :)
---
Are you getting the free version? You mentioned being interested in deadeye so not quite sure. 
---
Anyway, it's fine to play ranged in open world, in instanced content you're expected to stack for buffs but some classes (guardian, warrior, necromancer) do use ranged weapons in their combat rotation, although not in the way you might expect.
---
PM me your account name and we can do things together :)
---
I think I see slightly more in universe names than Xx Legolas Xx, but there are plenty of both.
---
Random question... Why stick with the shortcuts when not multiboxing? Was there a specific reason that we might be able to address in a future LB version?
---
just open any tradable item page on the wiki
---
Yes, when you buy the whole set, so of course the whole set will be unlocked. 
---
you can also just use the prototype position rewinder as it has no range cap and a much more manageable 30sec cooldown
---
I wish I'd known about it :(
---
At which point the devs will kill that method.
---
They don't give a shit about security, this is entirely aimed at crippling multiple account users.
---
Keep in mind you have to uninstall Arc every time the game updates, or it will lead to crashing.
---
You can actually see it in real time every major update on this subreddit.
---
The best solution is to not recommend the game to anyone. Unless you like disappointing your friends 
---
Yeah but fuck 2FA with your mobile phone. 
---
Anet just killed off a happy family 
---
I think you mean thieves. 
---
So an idiot at support decided to give out the password or change the email address that the password was sent to. Human based vector indeed. Yet they have us sign up with 2FA with our mobile phones, let alone see our IP and MAC address from the PC that is connecting with GW2, that we have to authenticate. So tell me the real reason.
---
No, the idea is that the swapping let's you pump out a lot of procs of the Geomancer sigil which you should have on both bows. Adds a non-trivial amount of extra bleeding. Alternatively if you use a Quickdraw variant of the build, weapon swap into poison volley substantially shortens it's cooldown, which let's you inflict a lot more condis via Poison.
---
this is really neat.
---
it would be cool if there was a setting where you didnt have to hold the radial button and it just selected the first mount you moused over
---
Cool! Would love to see raid markers there too. 
---
Have loved the mount one and I'll love the novelties! I just can't have enough circles!
---
For me it's just convenience I rarely multibox so that side is not so much of an issue for me. From the mass of information I trawled through to learn this much yesterday it is possible to multibox from batch files but the codes were a lot more complicated and I didn't really understand it.
---
I do hope LB finds a work around if for no other reason than to validate the huge effort they put in to creating it 
---
In the mean time this served my purpose so thought would share. if it was a use to anyone else then that is good if not it was just a few hours of my time. that is a small drop in the ocean of time I waisted farming hearts this week lol 
---
Will this be uploaded somewhere?
---
Probably was intended for a collection at some point, then they changed their minds.
---
Yeah, I'm afraid I can't hook into menus, I'm only allowed to send keybinds.
---
Yes I will take a recording for YouTube as well
---
oooh, sounds fun, can't wait :)
---
Kinda wish the LS maps had a unique buff for the duration of its initial release until the next episode gets released, similar to how raids has that double gold buff for its most recent wings, maybe like double season currency (so LS3 would have been unbound magic, LS4 would be Volatile magic, and whatever LS5 brings). the only Reason i enjoyed doing Istan over and over was to build up VM, not the unidentified gear.
---
And they made those beautiful screaching noises when attacking. Really miss them.
---
Yup. A short range frurious whirling of axes, dealing damage and deflecting ranged attacks. While standing still. And yeah, ideally you'd use something to give you stability prior to using it. 
---
One of my greater frustrations with playing my ranger is hitting it too early or hitting it in a hurry and accidentally canceling it. On the other hand, it's a lot of fun to use.
---
If you have old characters you will have a few years of birthday presents
---
Yup, that’s the one I was aware of. Thanks for linking it though, you never know. 
---
I guess that means the only way to improve my situation is to join a more populated server. This would mean that more people will be playing WvW so it'll feel more consistent, yes?
---
Cool, mesmer is awesome. 
---
So much more secure. Thanks Anet!
---
Hey there, big fan since I discovered you here on reddit with the original 5-mount wheel just after pof released, not really interested in novelties in general, but updated anyways to at least give it a look and i must say i really like it.
---
I found one interesting bug though, the program seems to encounter some troubles when you use a non-english keyboard.  I am german and know we have a different layout for they keyboard than americans/british and loads of other people have, the program doesn't though. The simplest example would be that on our keyboard the z and y buttons are swapped in their locations, special signs like brackets are in different positions, etc.
---
So when i set my tonic to Y in guild wars options, enter Y into the radial options, and then use the radial menu, you would expect it to press Y in game, but actually it does press Z, since that would be the button location on the american layout, and bring up the contacts menu (default set to Z in german game).
---
I hope i described it properly so you can understand^^
---
While it doesn't bother me and i'll just use different keybinds instead, i still wanted to bring it to your attention
---
Why do you say that?
---
Can anyone tell me if this has been verified for use by ANET? (ie. is it legal?) I did some digging and only found that it was once approved by Chris but his post is now gone.
---
The lornar’s pass event was fun
---
This a cool art style. Love it
---
Are you asking why have us follow security, when there is huge human vector on their side ? A point can be made that those protect us from this vector (in fact MO made that point in statement about incident)
---
Unless I misunderstood your question 
---
Ayeee this should be interesting!
---
Well, charr also call humans 'mice' so, judging by how offended asura commanders are by that line, it's probably just another insult.
---
Look for [these](https://i.imgur.com/0KRYtVz.png) icons in your Hero Panel -&gt; Achievements. It means there are achievements in that category that give you mastery points for whatever expansion (Core (red), HoT (green), PoF (purple))
---
So you clearly don't understand the mechanics behind what's going on.
---
Don't comment on things you don't understand.
---
Griffon is so gracious
---
I started using it a couple weeks ago and I love it.
---
Only thing I'd like to suggest is adding an option to ignore the GW2Mounts hotkey while you're typing in chat.
---
I like to use a single hotkey for my mounts so I unbound the in-game one and only use GW2Mounts to trigger my 'x' mount key. I also leave the deadzone set to my favorite mount to mimic the behavior of pressing the default in-game mount key.
---
The problem is that every time I'm typing on chat and press my GW2Mounts hotkey (x), it inputs on my chat the actual favorite mount binding (which is my '=' key, for my Jackal). So every time I type 'x' in the game chat, it outputs to 'x=' and it's annoying as heck.
---
A chat detection method and an option to disable the mount hotkey while chat is on would be great. 
---
Other than that, the only issue I have is that sometimes when I'm moving with either the left or right mouse button held on (to adjust the camera), pressing 'x' will not summon my favorite mount, but instead it will bring the one facing the last position my cursor was at before I held down the left/right mouse button.
---
I'd rather have a fractal of them.
---
I usuallly tell them that the entire game, all six years of it, is available for about six months of fees from a sub game, and since it's not pay to win that's all you'll ever have to pay to not be locked out of content.
---
What kinda potato are you playing on lol
---
I second the recommendation to go Shortbow/Shortbow Soulbeast.
---
It’s condition damage, and ascended Vipers gear isn’t the cheapest to get, but trinkets should be fairly easy with living season 3 maps (Bloodstone Fen, Ember Bay, Bitterfrost Frontier, Lake Doric, Draconis Mons, and Siren’s Landing). You can use any cheap exotic armor with condition damage while you save up. Throw on some Krait runes for bleeding duration and your preferred condi sigils. 
---
The Skirmishing and Wilderness Survival traitlines give you access to stuff that helps you survive in longer encounters while still doing nice damage. I tend to favor stances such as One Wolf Pack, Vulture Stance, and Moa Stance. Sharpened Edges for more damage. Dolyak Stance for defense. Merge with a condi pet, such as Lynx or Warthog. Warthog merged skills include a CC if you need it, and you can also use your 5th weapon skill and maybe Entangle for more CC. Your 2nd and 4h weapon skills should be used off cooldown. 
---
It makes a lot of content easier in my opinion. 
---
It honestly would be better if people like you only talked for themselves. If you're stupid, it doesn't mean that everyone around is too.
---
Precision Blade has got to be the most stupid achievement this company ever came up with. I have to make a new character fully equiped with a specific spec just for 5 AP. God.
---
Turn this upside down and you've got the Incredibles logo!
---
One of my favorite moments from that was getting all the way to the top with my partner and doing a costume brawl at the top...only to be feared off the edge by a costume brawl skill. Epic fail. It was great.
---
Singaporean here, can confirm on the ping spikes. We never get good pings in any games anyway :(
---
Introducing... the Bog
---
Yeah, and people don't seem to realize the danger here. These little bastards multiply fast. That's why the other week I made a guild for my Engi called "Asura Pest Control \[VRMN\]" to finally do something about this rodent infestation we have across all of Tyria. It's completely out of control and especially bad in Divinity's Reach. TINY little rodents running around everywhere! 
---
I did it to save the children, and the orphans. 
---
I'm currently working with the fine folks in Amnoon to negotiate trade contracts for the rats we don't burn on sight. 
---
At least that's pretty obviously a joke. Maybe there's some terribly clever sand pun we're not getting and Anet is just laughing at our collective whoooosh.
---
Lol I just read your name. I am glad your looking in to fixing this for us all from the post i read earlier on reddit I had kinda of got the impression you had had enough. If you actually watched my video you can see I still have the LB shortcut waiting in hope on my desktop  lol x 
---
But I'm not going to lie I only run LB when I want to multibox I'm just used to having the shortcuts there that I can move around a little so I know which I have done .... Maybe add a last logged in hehe 
---
This has been my push from the start. I really, really want, if nothing else, a Marionette fractal.
---
