Thank you for this info &lt;3 ! Appreciate it ! :-)
---
---
---
I highly recommend it! I have 3 sets (1 for each weight) and don't regret making any of them!
---
Hmm something just came to mind.
---

---
LS3 requires owning HoT.
---
LS4 requires owning PoF.
---
What will LS5 require? This is relevant because right now the expansions act as barriers to making a sale in some instances(people who do not own HoT aren't going to buy any gliders and people without PoF won't buy any mount skins) and if "They make more money from gemstore sales than from expansion sales. " is true then it makes a lot of sense to move away from expansions.
---
Yeah, that would be good too. I was thinking more of something you can craft on your way up too 500, but legendary good is a great idea as an end goal of cooking!
---
Thanks for letting me know!
---
Yes but if you ever played wow you’d know what what’s canon might not be the next day.
---
[removed]
---
This game is about moving your own ass away from danger. You don't have to facetank everything like in gw1.
---
Like everything else legendary the advantage is saving on inventory space.
---
None. Dead game mode. 
---
&gt; Originally they also advertised gw2 as LW only "expansion worth of content" game and soon after they changed into expansion model.
---
For some definition of soon. Is a year soon? 
---
&gt; Even the druid isn't tanky at all.
---
The pug minstrel druid at Xera begs to differ.
---
Here is my oneshot thief build, i got actually got multiple times top 100 eu  with it: http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vZAQNAoaVl0MhSnYjTwwJw/EL0E2cF8DOC9yCfhygWAYCFBA-jpBXABGfIAaoMQjHBgmPBAP/AAAY/BA
---
it´s the only build i truly enjoy playing in PvP because you are so impactfull. It is so satisfying to be able to blow everyone up at will.
---
Thanks to diviner, they now have more dps than druid :)
---
In an alternate universe this expansion is real and I'm happy. 
---
I see people constantly calling for a new expansion. Didn't we just have one? You can't just churn those out one after the other without having everything else suffer...
---
What a d\*ckhead, i had hope for a moment :(
---
&gt; I do wonder if/how this could potentially effect the economy.
---
I assume it'll be extremely difficult to get, just like the rest of the Legendaries. Most players won't have them, so most players will still be buying the rest of them.
---
It might impact it a little, but based on my Ph.D. in Baseless Speculation, I don't think it'd do it very much.
---
He mentioned four _content_ teams. We know there are, or were, three LS teams. It is entirely possible that the fourth is an expansion team. 
---
It was probably not mentioned because we have two LS episodes to finish first before the expansion can drop. 
---
But I do agree with you that Anet should reassure the players that an expansion is being worked on, if that is the case. Wild speculation is rampant and it would do a lot to assuage fears. 
---
It will require PoF most probably, since it would still follow the pattern of requiring the latest released expansion.  
---
One of the reasons you need the expansion is so they can make sure you'll have the masteries they'll use in the content so they can design the content with them in mind. Like mounts for S4.
---
Maybe one day they'll have a season requiring multiple expansions so we have have all masteries working at the same time in fun ways.
---
I don't see this as a realistic problem. I've never used the expensive power food and I've never been kicked out of or asked to leave a raid group. I think I've had a grand total of 3 people call me out and use snarky remarks in my 2 years of raiding and I just casually reminded them that I'm still out dpsing them and therefore contributing my fair share to the group.
---
GW1 had 2 expansions in 1 year and they were both better than the GW2 expansions
---
That sounds like garbage and I really hope they don't do that. They're Legendary so they're probably already going to be extremely expensive, I don't want to then after spend tons more gold adding the ability to actually use it.
---
It definitely happens with the Acid Bomb, but if anything happens on the Rocket Boots it's too subtle for me to notice.
---
They'll never say never, because they've said they wouldn't do things before and later changed their mind. No one can know what will ever happen, no matter what was discussed in the past.
---
Before the first expansion was being worked on Anet said they had no intention of making one. But the community pushed and pushed and suddenly poof, they're working on an expansion. 
---
Saying nothing will happen in a business that is run by multiple people and even a changing cast of people is just bad to do in the first place, whether it violates the NDA or not.
---
I'm biased since I used to train on [Raiders in Training](https://discord.gg/SvsVzVQ) but I'd say give them a shot too. Ya, I can very easily tell that multiple people were in wrong stats and obviously wrong builds. I still do weekly trainings with my guild if you were interested as well, we normally run on Sat after missions (~7 PST). Usually people don't mean any harm by it but they just don't know what "raid ready" means, you can offer to share some resources like [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7zlH3pVPvW21WIh5-qL-IXDeABtJzIqnZYXP8tCcM0/edit) or even just point them to [snowcrows' builds](https://snowcrows.com/raids/) and again if they do need help gearing I always recommend [this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character).
---
I think I'd have to actually see you raid or have more logs to look at for anything minor but it looked fine to me. Your normal "rotation" should be all your axe/wh skills &gt; CA 4,3,2 &gt; axe/wh skills. Heavy priority on CA 4 and WH 5 obviously. Rest of it comes down to knowing the fights and when you might need to save or use skills (like saving CA for Gors slam phase or getting a soldier on MO). Your pet is usually going to be a DPS one (iboga/jacaranda) until you need to swap for CC (rock gazelle/lightning wyvern) though double CC works if you think the group needs it. 90% of fights are just iboga + wyvern though and swapping when you need to. I'd suggest you read through the [snowcrows guide](https://snowcrows.com/raids/guides/ranger/druid/heal/) as well if you haven't already, lots of it won't apply to pug and training groups but it's good to know what is expected in more experienced groups.
---
They're definitely not creating the story on the fly. The broad strokes were there all along. They have an overarching idea of where they want the story to go. That said, they're not necessarily attached to that and it can change based on a lot of different factors. 
---
That's assuming there are 50 F2P players like me, and not people who buy a cosmetic every few months but wouldn't want to pay a fee just to keep the ability to play the game.
---
Not any time in the near future. Gw2 without a expansion for the next 2 years atleast. Looks rough 
---
If Ep6 is coming let's say May and if they keep the same 3 month or so cadence between PoF and S4, we'll probably see S5 in Aug/Sep.
---
Were they really, or is it just your nostalgia telling you they were?  
---
Would people really prefer 2 expansions per year which each have about the same content as 2 living story patches, but you have to pay for them instead of getting them for free?
---
They set them to macros and push a button.
---
&gt; I know it is the "fad" to hate on things,
---
I know it is the "fad" to call disliking bright in-your-eyes gemstore items a "fad", but pointing your finger at others doesn't magically vaporize their opinion regarding the game's aesthetics.
---
MST?
---
Ive never been banned but havnt bothered with the official forums in years. There is no meaningful conversation to be had there. "Better Moderated" should not mean "Highly censored" but that's what it is. She didn't do great things the last couple years of GW1 and she didnt do any great things for GW2; she had a job because she had been at the company forever and knew very well that NCSoft was going to axe her.   
---
Like I said, I get that people are gonna downvote me because everyone loved her for some reason, but she wasnt especially great at her job as the Face of ANET in either game after the first couple years of GW1. 
---
Oh, you mentioned using Tomes so I thought you wanted to get level-up rewards from that. Tomes *do* give the rewards.
---
If you're pugging and not in a raid static group, I would recommend owning 1 full Diviner's/Zerker set, and 1 full Minstrel's set. In a good group there are really only a couple fights you -should- use Minstrels to tank (Desmina, Largos). Other fights with tank mechanics (Gorse, MO, Sam to an extent) don't really do that much damage to a chrono and too much toughness is overkill. Only wear Minstrels if you don't trust your healers in those cases.  
---
  
---
In a good static group you can get away with less toughness on most fights. I accidentally tanked Souless Horror CM in diviner's/zerker recently... it was not a fun experience.  
---
Unfortunately playing Chrono means owning multiple sets of armour. I have full Legendary Armour and Weapons, and both available Legendary trinkets on mine and I still use about 30 bag slots just for gear. (And I'm a pretty lazy chrono.)
---
Does not sound like that much to me tbh. Living world is gonna get a increased time span so this means less bigger content-chunks. Also what's with the next expansion? Not even a single word has been dropped about that one but instead they stick their heads into more living world stuff. C'mon. Do you really wanna finish off a elder dragon this way? 
---
You can't do that. Once you leave the raid instance with the chest unlooted, you can't get that chest until next week.
---
If only cosmetic items with unique features like that were actually rewards for achieving something substantial in the game, and not a credit card check.
---
No room to go north.
---
Wait, there is a red panda springer? Since when?
---
Nah, just put the LI, decorations, and exotic/ascended in the dangle chest that has the mag/gaeting.
---
me too , plus i stay parallel to white area in green box
---
then before hit ground i go forward
---
This should've been the expansion announcement we a few months ago. Looks really amazing and its a shame Anet doesn't understand why a expansion is so important to the health of a game.
---
What does the Metabolic Primer does anyway? Never tried it.
---
Yeah makes sense. I'll be curious to see the results whenever there are some.
---
It seems like the point or this update, beyond improving inventory wars, was likely to encourage people with high MF to play the maps to get items, rather than just buy stacks of unids on the tp. It will be interesting to how much of a difference it will make to overall prices.
---
If you’re blessed by RNGesus you might get a Super Weapon Box drop. Then you can choose a non account bound Blue SAB weapon skin to sell at TP. Last I checked, most of them instant sell around 26g (before tax). 
---
Aside from that, you should at least unlock the home node so you can farm baubles year round. 
---
Theres some issue though as Dry Top design is heavily constrained by the way they choose to expand the map. It feels neither huge or open when navigating through it; it's just constrained by wall, corridors and narrow passages with part 3 only connected to part 2, part 2 completely disconnected from part 1, part 1 connected to nothing. 
---
Silverwastes is mostly flat with 2 levels on top of each other (including a huge underearth caverne that is devoided of anything and served 0 purpose except falling to your death) and the labyrinth sandwiched in-between. The parts  that relate to the story are usually disconnectedd from the open world either in empty areas (next to meta boss) or instances (glintering caves). Yest the meta-boss was added later but it's a very small part of the map.
---
It would be fun if Southsun Cove ever connects to Sparkfly Fen or if we fill in that empty part of the Shiverpeakls between Timberline Falls / Sparkfly Fen / Bloodtide Coast. Would be nice too if we can go behind the wall at Istan to reach Methani Keys or Zehlon Reach though I doubt about that because Istan is locked behind LWS4E1.
---
These things are why I'm the only person in the guild with decorating rights.
---
I have a prediction that a map (area) be available on the area above Harathi Hinterlands (Kryta). This particular map also gonna be a gateway to The Depths of Tyria. 
---
5 minutes is absurdly long, jesus. That's like... You could have killed the next boss in that time.
---
Hot damn. The first time I ever wanted a backpack / glider. 
---
Was probably more for the tone of your comment than anything else, I’d guess.
---
&gt;The Competitive Team has been working on the idea of building a festival that highlights both sPvP and WvW. It’s a fun concept that would allow us to focus on those game types and try new things.
---
It  will occur in late November and be called "Asskickings"
---
The first four things *result* in having fun. Having positive interactions with other players, feeling autonomous, pursuing horizontal progression of your own volition instead of chasing vertical progression you need, and having new ways to do old stuff are all things that result in fun, no matter what the content actually is.
---
I think the all the green looks pretty nice. :u
---
What they did was actually pretty fair.
---
Thanks so much.  Finally got everything set.  Issue I had following the above was that by doing that, it meant that I got a completely vanilla .dat file.  So all the sound settings where not where I had them.  All the UI settings that I had changed were gone.  Most importantly, the graphics was set to fullscreen instead of fullscreen windowed.  Of course if I changed them, Launchbuddy overwrote them.  So I deleted the Launchbuddy .dat files again.  I opened gw2 normally and made the changes then created the launchbuddy accounts.  All good once again.  Thank you!
---
My female charr has her arms outstretched in front of her with it equipped. 
---
Honestly I wouldn't be against paying a small amount for living world.
---
Say $5 per episode.
---
Most guides online are for endgame content. The levelling process can be a little challenging for engineers in the beginning though. But here are some starting points:
---
-	race doesn’t matter
---
-	unlock kits first (bomb and grenade specifically)
---
-	rifle for power damage, pistol-pistol for condi and blind, pistol-shield for the block
---
-	get damage traits in the explosions and firearms lines
---
-	get utility traits in the tools line (streamlined kits is great for open world movement)
---
Let’s not forget that mounts will make it very hard to limit maps without using very tall walls.
---
Active. Not even remotely dying.
---
If I had to guess, PvE slightly growing, PvP population dropped a couple years back and has stayed about Even, WvW slightly dying.
---
The population varies with releases. It gets pretty busy when new patches are released. But there's plenty of people in game doing content. That is I never have trouble finding help or players doing what I'm doing, no matter what I'm doing.
---
Or building it just requires 100 of each. 
---
There was also no room to go south prior to Anet expanding the map southwards just before PoF, so they can probably go anywhere if they wanted to.
---
This is an interesting hypothesis considering all the stuff that looked unfinished in the latest living story maps. 
---
&gt;considering the amount of them im seeing in game compared to other chairs
---
Eh, the number will reduce in time. People always show off the brand new shiny. Mounts and chairs are just the most obvious, especially when they're so, well, obvious.
---
The tl;dr for this is
---
They can't have two people "owning" one account, if they message support with enough evidence to support hacking then they can give it back, escalating doesn't solve much, it just means someone else gets on the case/ticket and they have to re-check again
---
Give as much info as humanly possible for the best chance of them getting back on
---
These look amazing!!!
---
IMO the difference between a CM player and a regular T4 player is like comparing a T4 player to a T3 player. That should give you an idea on how massive the difficulty spike is for CM. 
---
That being said, I find 99CM to be harder than 100CM. It took 6 hours for my training run to get the first kill whereas 100CM only took 2 hours. 
---
Siax is no doubt the hardest fight in 99CM. When it phases, players need to split up to kill Echoes. It's a massive dps check and where most inexp group falters. As if that's not hard enough, the ground is ~~lava~~ poison and everything is out there to kill you. Think Siren Reef final boss fight sort of chaos but much deadlier. 
---
Ensolyss just has a bitemore mechanic, harder bullet hell but not much trouble otherwise. MAMA is harder in comparison because of breakbar check. 
---
As for 100CM, the sudden and quick OHKO rays can be shocking at first but you'll soon get used to utilising the invulnerable frames of Special Action leap to avoid them in a pinch. The dps check is in the form of killing anomalies so they spawn bomb shelter dome. But since it can be ganged up by several players the dps check is not as hard as the Echoes of 99CM. It's more about having the spatial awareness/knowledge when Anomalies appear. 
---
The hardest part for 100CM is when low health Arkk goes berserk during the disappearing platform phase. It doesn't last long (but sure feels forever!), survive that phase and the kill is in the bag.
---
Btw, as hard as CMs are, exp players make them feel like regular T4s. So don't be surprised if you happen to chance upon good run :p
---
If you have played a healer in CM (esp druid), I guarantee you *nothing* in T4 will faze you anymore. If you play dps in T4, you'll probably be able to solo bosses now heh. 
---
Very nice reply! I'll try dominate all aspects of this profession!
---
Nothing wrong with criticism 
---
It would be interesting to know what percentage of their income comes from gem shop versus expansion sales.   If there still is a significant amount of income coming from expansion sales, then it makes sense for the new content to still be tied to expansions instead of reworking core Tyria maps that would not lead to any additional revenue.   ANET still is a business and needs their new content to somehow translate into new revenue. 
---
Better how?
---
But the game wasn't fine, hence why they changed their content delivery.
---
What's the point of Executioner in a 1-shot build?
---
Here we go! Another roadmap!
---
It's a different game. Try that process that, then get back to us.
---
Or, you know what? Don't come back.
---
As eating animations.
---
YOU CAN USE THE FIST ON THE ROCKETS?
---
That's not true. The last financial report was during a quarter when there was no Living World release. The quarters before that were really strong given how long ago PoF was released. 
---
Of course reality is broke! Look at all them gem items! ;)
---
Here’s is what you do Create an lfg that says “Volcanic for Legendary all welcome and you set the Fractal to the smallest number for your legendary.
---
1) new players will join cus they don’t know any better and 2) other players working on their legendaries will be glad to see that someone is doing the Fractal that they need as well.
---
This. I get that they have to make money or whatever, but does it ALL have to be cash shop content? Why couldn't this be an ascended/legendary back item that you have to build yourself?
---
Prrrretty sure they've got off a significant part of the top of the map from in-game.
---
Dude. He's literally neglected the last two content releases to do this. He's not starved for content. Give it up.
---
A new TD needs to have reduced mob density though. I can never enjoy much of the scenery when a chak or mushroom is shooting projectiles at me from a distance.
---
My guess is that S5 focuses on a non-dragon-related story and that after that we'll get what will likely be the final expansion that takes us to Cantha.
---
For what game-mode? You're better usually with scourge if you want boon strip or any other healer for more healing.
---
yeah but like I said it's super unreliable / takes too long sometimes / can't be used midair or queued for immediately on landing 
---
No expansion? Dead game...
---
You can also find another group that raids. . We're (thankfully) not locked to 1 guild in Gw2
---
the game has never balanced around open field fight.
---
it's all about objective.
---
even in spvp which is 10 times more balance than wvw   if there was no node to keep people in  people could just kite forever. 
---
What were some of the JS libraries you used? Did you grab any from ArenaNet official?
---
Where did i talked bullshit about the game? I think you talking bullshit now. Critics must be allowed.
---
This looks way better than what they have in store for the future :o
---
Yes, I was lazy on some of them :)
---
WvW roaming pov:
---
There will never truly be balance, always crowned a select few professions/builds that will excel in most fights 1v1 or small-scale. Take it with a grain of salt... it's been like this for many years.
---
You mentioned **condi being broken** so good news for you - I personally run into very little of these builds aside from the rare condi mirage and this is T1 so it might be different for other servers/tiers. Trapper thief got deleted, the only viable build I've ran would be condi evade spam death blossom (again, haven't seen one of these in over a year) and possibly gimmick dire FBrand. This all depends on the player as well but yeah, not many condi builds at all and if they are it's meme gimmicks.
---
Most roaming builds practically run power these days. Common ones you'll run into are power shatter/lockdown mirage + core mes, boonbeast + sic em sniper beast (very popular atm especially against players on warkitties), power shiro rev (I'm still using tubby two tun's build), DE rifle + staff DD + a few pistol whip (admittedly less DE riflers due to recent changes to sentry + tiered up towers applying revealed if you stay too long in stealth but there are still a few of them). I've seen guilds doing well with DH (I think LB #2 got range buff).
---
Then you've got more tankier/sustain stuff like scrapper, boonbeast, SBreaker and a few scourges (blood magic) but these are usually in group fights or lure you until their buddies show up.
---
Again it's all subjective and depends on server/tiers/timezone you play in but these are the ones I run into the most.
---
Overall I much prefer power meta over condi. You should try out some gimmick builds for fun - my favorite is full zerk Gun Flame berserker which one shots most squishies, especially thieves.
---
Hope that helps answer your question.
---
I love that they talk to us. And i hope They coninue. I dont want to be that ass, but i have to say... What am i about to do with my New legendary Runes? With my New 500 food? With build templates if there is no content. Its the same old dungeons fracs and raids. Not a single Word on grp content besides a almost done raid probably 2-3 months away... This game needs content and Not All those gimmicks that should have Been in there for years now... Anet plz we NEED content to play with All this stuff you give us.
---
I already Got envoys Herald, dungeoneer and fractal god... But maybe thats my fault. Thx for the headsup an way. 
---
When you want to sit on your new chair, while waiting for the next Hub race... And you can't. :'(
---
Nope. Still PvP hard and story-lite.
---
Time for my Char to pilot his Mobile Suit  😂 
---
if you have ~250,000 karma, you can buy a full set of berserker's armor from Keeper Jonez Deadrun at the Cathedral of Silence in Orr (assuming the waypoint is unlocked by the meta-event)
---
&gt;I think the dwindling size of the raid community kind of speaks for itself here: Raids are too inaccessible. Making them require five people, instead of 10, would help a lot.
---
There's training raid guilds where people are more than happy to lend a helping hand. I'm not sure how is it 'inaccessible' in this sense.
---
&gt;I also think that the 10-man requirement makes people more toxic. Once you need to gather a bunch of people and everyone needs to do things well, it's a lot more likely that someone is going to cause a wipe and tilt every other person in the group. That helps explain why raid requirements can get ridiculous, while fractal LFG requirements tend to be a bit more relaxed, even for CMs.
---
You clearly don't remember/haven't played dungeons pre-rewards nerf. Remember the AP requirements? People were just as toxic. You can see it in T4 fractals as well. CM requirements are similar to raids, especially if you want a group that knows what it's doing.
---
&gt;Obviously, this wouldn't please everyone. But the raid community is a small minority. And at the current rate, it's not going to exist for much longer. So maybe something should be done.
---
I don't get this notion. Doing something for the sake of doing it is what will harm raiding. Yes, raiders are in the minority. That doesn't mean raids are going to die, and neither does it mean it needs saving. If anything, it's the lack of wings that's been the main issue raiders complain about. Shouldn't that be the clear focus?
---
5 man raids would have to be more mechanically difficult to pull that off, and I don't think that's something Anet would be willing to do. I think this would be the final nail in the coffin for the NA raid scene.
---
Overall a terrible idea. It would make much more sense to introduce proper easy/hard modes to raids instead of modifying them to be 5-man. Some of the raid bosses cannot be modified in this way.
---
Regarding 99/100 CM. These instances are mechanically speaking a lot more challenging than raids. So they shouldn't be considered a step below them. The only reason it feels easy to do for experienced fractal players is because you can cheese a lot of fights if you have high DPS and players who use certain items from their inventory to CC the bosses.
---
Uh ... ~~raid~~dungeon?
---
Definitely not. 10 man makes things much more unique, diverse and original than 5 man ever could. More interesting mechanics, more fun compositions, bigger scale, etc. Raids are still as easy as ever to get into and find groups for. It's also the only content ANet is still willing to make remotely challenging, as they said they want no more CM fractals. Trying to make raids catered to players who don't want actual challenge in the first place will just make everyone not bother with it, since raiders want actually hard content and most casuals just want rewards. You could easily see this past wintersday with the secret lair of the snowmen (which is still stupid that it's not permanent content).
---
I'm all for bringing back CM fractals, but sacrificing the best instanced content in the game for that is a no go. It also is not a way to return dungeons. if you try to force dungeons into raids you get exactly the same scenario as with fractals right now. Trash filled, stretched out instances with extremely boring and mechanically basic bosses (TO, SR, DS, etc. are all clear examples of this) that are disliked by a huge part of the playerbase.
---
Just add that huge map in the middle of brand crater that will conect all maps there pls. It would be a huge one :-D 
---
I would love to be able to make these typical guild warsy paint strokes with torn edges and rough gradients as you have in the background myself. Could you elaborate on how you make those?
---
The icons have kind of a funny back story. Last year for April Fools [I created a teaser landing page for an underwater expansion(https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/88s240/next_expansion_call_of_the_deep_teased/) (that's also what kicked off the idea to make a full page this year). About a month later, u/Vjetar created [a post inspired by my page](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8g4e3s/call_of_the_deep_theorycrafting_an_underwater/) theory-crafting specializations for such an expansion. As he was inspired by my work, I thought it was only fitting to take those names and create icons for them, completing the circle of inspiration. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I tried to stick close to his concepts, but as I worked on the icons, some visuals just worked a little better than the names he had created, like the necromancer. After sketching out an octopus like icon I fell in love with the idea of a Cthulhu style cultist who could summon or invoke the horrors of the deep. I mean, how awesome would a Cthulhu helmet be for their elite spec armor?
---
Minstrel/harrier chrono is ok but you could be bringing a lot more DPS instead of mediocre heals. Since you can no longer share boons with [SoI](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Signet_of_Inspiration) or [Bountiful Disillusionment](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bountiful_Disillusionment) you can't give stability, regen, protection, or a bunch of other useful boons. Also with fractals the way they are now you really do want diviner to cap out boon duration and be able to keep up quickness and alacrity easily.
---
Was the art in the background made for this? Also, that video didn’t work for me, if it’s supposed to really play. Amazing job! Ah god I hope this is what the expansion turns out be really be someday 
---
You can loot if you join the same instence with the charakter that killed the boss. 
---
The thing is we just don't know.  We don't know how long season 5 is.  We don't know if there will be an expansion.  We don't know if there will be elite specs tied with the expansion or living story 5.  We don't know if we will get 3rd gen legendaries.  I mean it would be great to actually know for some closure, but for now we just know what they're going to do/want to do from their post today.
---
Looki at the wiki it's a option too. 
---
Damn that sounds like a deal breaker already. Wouldn't that make it impossible to chase down a roamer that decides to disengage in their own territory?
---
If you want this kind of communication the community has to stop bitching about things like the WvW alliance update. It was announced as a possible project before work was done (so we could have input on whether they commit to it or not) and thus the wait time between knowing about it and receiving the content was going to be enormous (given the scope of the project). It's also possible the delivered project will look different from when it was first described.
---
There are several features in this post that are going to take months to release and there is a chance some may be scrapped or dramatically altered before they see the light of day. If we see the predictable backlash moaning about how they said they were doing it and it never arrived or it arrived too late, we are punishing them for talking about it openly.
---
If the community wants open communication, they have to behave like people who can handle it. That means being patient when features announced today might take over a year to deliver and the possibility they will be scrapped in development or put on the backburner.
---
If you're issue was the quantity/quality of content/feature delivery, this will change nothing for you (and that's the substantial area from a player perspective). Knowing what's in the works won't give you more things to do in-game, so if that's where your hurt is, it ain't going away.
---
These releases were so "rich" he can catch up in 2 videos with them.
---
You're getting downvoted, but you are absolutely speaking the truth here. Six years for a feature we already had is just way too late.
---
Chairs are now the meta. You sit in them, collect them and that's where we are with the current Endgame.
---
Oh and getting the Warclaw Mount so you can join the cool kids club.
---
Could try to get back and kill Qadim and try to find a CM group for w5/w6?.  W7 won't come out for another month and a half to 2 months most likely.  Are you only interested in the raid content and have you checked out their official post today?
---
Piece of uncommon gear
---
Exotic chance with MF - 1,2%
---
Exotic chance without MF - 0,1%
---
So you have 90% less chance of getting exotic value item.
---
Yeah but your Charr is furless, that's like 30% less volume. 
---
&gt; He mentioned four content teams. We know there are, or were, three LS teams. It is entirely possible that the fourth is an expansion team.
---
Or it's festival / current event team. They never confirmed expansion team existed after PoF anymore.
---
An expansion would probably be the biggest lure for ex-guildies of mine. I've been trying to lure back 3 to no avail since I returned to the game last year. We've been playing MMOs together since 2007. One came back all excited but constant DCs which she could never solve drove her away (she's very computer savvy, tried all the recommended advice and fixes, none worked), another even though he is doing nothing in the game isn't budging from FFXIV because ..... expansion. The last is on a year long break from all MMOs and is looking to come back. Living Worlds though very well made etc. with their slow releases just aren't a big enough lure for the latter two. 
---
Base gear is harrier. Unless you are going to use pug meta on SC site now.
---
Even have jalis, ventari, shiro and mallyx!
---
Compared to current 7 years of lifetime? Yes.
---
so the wvw pvp team gets fired next...
---
let's see how they goals worked out so far for wvw/pvp
---
Encourage players to interact positively : fail, the newbie flaming/bashing after that mount release was out of control, not to mention the normal level of circle jerking around those so called community leaders
---
Support player autonomy: fail, be a brainless meta build Zerg drone or get lost. there is no room for individual builds or class choice at wvw/pvp, unless you got a thick skin and the constant bulling doesn't affect you.
---
Focus on horizontal progression instead of vertical: fail, the only progression is the continued buffing of condition damage, to get the last idiot be able to facerolling. the class balancing and brainless nerves to put on wvw/pvp player only to match pve sure makes for a nice progression.
---
Build upon previous designs: success, wvw/pvp truly is built on previous designs. the same bugs and hacks that already existed 5 years ago are still up and running. like for example standing nose to nose to an enemy but your range skills are still obstructed
---
Strive for the fun
---
It looks really good, especially the Profession icons.
---
Maybe the wiki is blocked as a Gaming site at his institution but Reddit is not
---
You are in a safe place. Does it have noise canceling mode ?
---
Can you imagine how a 5man largos twins would look like? PUGs finally got away from mirage only and now we want it right back...
---
Why not both?
---
Hence the "or something" part, 5 min is merely my suggestion, I'm sure a reasonable timeframe could be agreed upon.
---
If any new expansion comes out, I actually hope that it is an underwater one. It's such a unique game mode that isn't supported enough to be fun
---
Thanks a bunch everyone &lt;3. These sound super useful! Will give those a look :D
---
Think he means that in its current state it doesn't encourage casuals to compete. This doesn't support the goal of encouraging more casuals (which is probably the only reason anet is supporting this) as well as if his suggestion of a more tiered prize system was implemented.
---
XcQ should be all you need to know for that URL.
---
It's 2am here and now I'm mad that you trolled me.
---
Exactly this. Join groups to run the daily T1 fractals and each fractal you run above your personal level will increase your personal level. You dont have to go 1,2,3,4,5 if you are joining a group where someone else is already high enough to open the fractal.
---
Ah, I see. I assumed you compared, since that was your retort to GW2 not yet being and hopefully never becoming a butchered mess of microtransactions.  If you just palavered for the sake of it, my assumption has of course been wrong.
---
Yes. All dugeons are even soloable so 3 man is not that bad. just know what you're doing.
---
This may be because a lot of people are hanging out in lounges. Mistlock sanctuary is packed 24/7. Also, at least for this last week, SAB has drawn people to Rata Sum.
---
Buying any expansion lifts f2p restrictions.
---
Thank you guys for your opinion. See you In Tyria. Soon 80lvl :)
---
What armor is your human ranger wearing ?
---
The amount of praise you guys are giving is baffling to me. I guess it’s a bit sad that you are so starved for something that a message that says. “Stuff and things may happen, but they can totally be cancelled too, oh and we built the groundwork so it’s better this time!”
---
Other than a few smaller things announced this is more fluff to pad what little there is. Almost nothing here is “new” or different than what they are already doing.
---
Keep in mind that Mike is a big reason they lost over a third of their company. It’s his job to keep everything flowing and working properly and while he “paced around saying we’ll get through this, over 140 employees lost their job. They are the ones that lose... this dude gets to keep his job and probably even got a raise while everyone else suffered because of his mismanagement. 
---
People used to blame Colin for shit that went wrong but guess what, he answered to Mike. And look what happened now? Mikes been in charge and putting people everywhere on projects that went nowhere and seemingly allowing mismanagement all over the place... and look what happened.
---
He should have lost his job along with the other management that is seemingly clueless. Instead you fire the talent that would probably excel with the right leaders. The right people never get punished... 
---
No one ever stopped you from doing a raid with a 5 man squad...
---
Might take longer, but you get what you want
---
So is this same amount of people on all the other big chairs / thrones. It doesn't look any worse or better.
---
Thanks for the numbers, Enko.
---
I am still undecided about this change. My biggest gripe is that it removed a nice reward mechanic that encouraged wealth transfer from veterans with high MF to newer players with low MF, which isnt the case anymore and now new players get over 50% less for their unid gear on the tp.
---
Obviously, there will be a lot less ectos coming into the economy now from salvaged rares and exotics. Thats a good thing in my opinion because over all, since the introduction of unid gear with PoF, the market got flooded with it and something had to be done.
---
But since the value rise of ectos is likely to be gradual and take a couple of months at least, I think the bigger economic impact will be on future charms and symbol supply, especially with yesterdays news of legendary runes and sigils in the works.
---
First of all, a lot less charms and symbols will be salvaged from identified gear, so less supply and secondly there might be more demand, even before legendary runes and sigils will be introduced (which may be another 6-12 months) because now there are plenty less exotics dropping that had popular (and expensive) runes and sigils slotted and that deficit has to be crafted now from charms and symbols (and ectos).
---
Though you can skip the event by porting over the trigger line for the event with the Magma balls and simply walking up to the Lock to destroy it
---
CoE is doable at 3 if you have the tools (dash/portal) for the laser part.
---
what are some good runes for power dragon hunter thats not scholars
---
&gt; Love the game so if there's anything new that could make me play...
---
What do you love about this game? Just play that content.
---
Nice, thanks!
---
CoE/aetherpath requires a minimum of 4 ppl; 
---
Easy to 3man: CoF p1/3, SE p1/3, TA up/forward, HotW p1 (p2/3 has underwater bosses wich is annoying imo), CM are all kinda annoying if you dont have stealth or a lot if dmg, AC are Easy even with low damage,  and arah is a bit annoying if you dont have stealth and dont know the adds' mechanics 
---
I hope its helpful 
---
I do plan to get both, actually! So thank you for that ^-^
---
Thats what i said, its soloable too
---
[Rune of the Flame Legion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Flame_Legion) looks like a very interesting pick: you lose 3% at worst from Scholar (this assumes you have 100% scholar uptime) and a bit of Ferocity but you a guaranteed 7% modifier and the burn duration increase is not completely useless since you can output a fair amount of it.
---
[Rune of the Ogre](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Ogre) is also probably interesting as you get the same Ferocity as Scholar but "only" a 4% flat modifier with no conditions. The rock dog does a bit of damage but in some situations you may not want to have a non manageable pet/minion poping out while you are in combat.
---
No, i solo it every day.  You can Skip it
---
The problem with core maps is that once you are able to cope with the increased difficulty of expansion maps then core maps are too easy. If they revamped the level scaling, or made core maps harder I would have a lot more intrest in playing in them.
---
No you can blink past the trigger point so the door never closes and you can solo p1
---
I would suggest just looking for groups doing daily clears in your tier. I must admit I have no idea if these exist in t1 though. But my point is, you'll have far better chances of finding a group for a daily fractal than for a specific level.
---
There hasn't been anything since lul
---
Short answer is: I don't.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The main thing is they wouldn't need to. Expansions bring considerably more profits, but also cost considerably more to create. I fully expect LW updates to be more cost effective for ANet. Even judging purely by their decision to stick with them and not have an expansion between seasons 4 and 5.
---
Rly? Okay, didn't know that, my bad then
---
Wouldn't recommend that to beginners though, bc failing will probably make it impossible to retry the skip, I assume? 
---
No.
---
Normal mode
---
If it would take as long as WvW alliance update... by 2021 we would get an update... on the update.
---
I was named in the OP and even I didnt know who he is or what i said to them. Did some digging and i think its about a thread they [posted 6 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9j5gfb/just_a_friendly_reminder_for_fellow_raiders/), which was since deleted (I wonder why).
---
If you want the updated maps they've used for this site without labels, urls and full resolution for your own projects you can always find them [here](https://thatshaman.com/files/maps/).
---
I generate these myself using Anet's files from the dat file and API so they're a very close approximation of how things look like in game.
---
Its pretty easy tbh, if know how it works, but you can check it on a lot of youtube solos and copy it
---
You get depreciating returns when using both.  Glyph of Industry saves you around 0.66 seconds per harvest normally, but on the consortium sickle it's only saving you 0.33 seconds.
---
Other glyphs still provide their full value regardless of what skin is applied.
---
&gt; With magic find that high it's hard to see if it's actually a real nerf or not
---
I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here. It's clearly a nerf, or are you talking about 0% MF pre patch compared to post patch?
---
I played Dgh for a long time now, but since I switched to Healbrand its way easier to clear CMs.
---
I guess most healer in the game just don't know what to do...
---
Healbrand works very well especially in 100CM since you can top ALL players.
---
Pretty sure Slb only gains 150 toughness tue to [Pack Alpha](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pack_Alpha), but otherwise you're correct!
---
Its an unofficial term used by people to describe an insect or something akin to an insect, in this case a spider.  I was into entomology as a kid at one point and remember the term being used that way quite a bit.
---
Here's the [definition on dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/bug) that supports that usage.  Admittedly, I never realized there were more official meanings to this word til this conversation came up.
---
Still no mention of another expansion... Does this mean there won't be another expac? :(
---
Capes is the only long standing meme missing now. Though scarves, skirts and banners have been interesting over the past year
---
coming from this sub reddit it doesn't even surprise me anymore
---
I am sorry to interupt your awesome work, but you have switched places Dry Top and Silverwastes. Could you please change them, because I really really want to download it. Good work!
---
I explicitly play engineer, it is a tonne of fun. One gripe is the extremely limited variability in weapons, I didn’t expect to be using rifle for 6 years. Coupled with being locked to only one weapon and the fact that there are essentially zero lore and class appropriate legendaries to work towards ( besides Hope, but I’ve never enjoyed condition builds )
---
Theres literally nothing since W6 LUL
---
I'm really scared though, I just can't imagine how much they will try to monetize the whole thing
---
Shame they didn't manage to reproduce hot meta event deepness, at least I won't be lost when doing them
---
Thanks 
---
exactly, what is better than doing what you love over and over and over and over again? Dont see a problem here.
---
1.) Flipping
---
2.) Raid Selling
---
3.) Fractal 96/42 farming with fractal titles
---
4.) Dungeon Tours
---
5.) Fractal Farming without titles
---
6.) Anything in openworld.
---
What I'm feeling is they will shamelessly throw a price tag 800 gems per tag. Or they could be nice and give us a free build template tag per character and charge the next tabs 800 gems per tag.. i wish it's 400 gems or lower, considering how long we waited for them.
---
One of the easiest options in terms of rotation is [cDPS SB \(shortbow only\)](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/soulbeast/condition/). You pretty much use your damaging skills off cooldown. If you want some higher DPS options that are a little harder on the rotation [firebrand](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition/) and [berserker](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/berserker/condition/) are good options and of course for fights were it actually matters [mirage](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/mirage/condition/) is still the best.
---
I'd rather want 10-man fractals than 5-man raids
---
I just started doing raids, currently only have 14Li, but I really enjoy the endgame content. I have all classes at rank 80 so now I’m just working towards unlocking the last 3 specializations and their respective specialization collections. I’m also trying to max gear the 3 different armor classes. Have a Daredevil, Dragonhunter and Chronomancer in fully ascended gear so I have some variety in playing said endgame content, this is my current goal. Just finished my support chrono so now I’m slowly getting the hang of that class by doing low tier fractals. Whenever I get bored with that class I just start max gearing another class. That’s What’s keeping me busy lately, as well as reaching mastery 283 but finished with that last week.
---
Dont have the consortium sickle. Im not too bothered about min-maxing something that already nets me a couple gold per day in 2 mins that is probably something I wouldn’t do if it took 5 minutes
---
GW2 have enough content even for ppl with 3k+ hours in the game. The stuff that needs addressing is not the content. Build templates and WvW to start. 
---
In my opinion LW should stop after season 5. Because it is already to much to do even for veteran player. How many maps are busy every day? Like 5... and 4 of them are HoT maps.
---
For 800 you can create an alt. Most ppl who need build templates have enough ascended boxes to gear up several.
---
This price would only work in extreme cases of "this is my only main character" witch quite an opposite of GW2 philosophy.
---
I only do t1 and t2. What I did was, just join the groups doing the dailies. Eventually I got them all unlocked. You can also lfg with a description like "4 for progression / all welcome / fun run"
---
There's a lot of partial skin "sets", for example: last year [Zephyrite weapons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zephyrite_weapons) (maybe will be expanded this year), [Nightmare](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Nightmare_weapon_skins) and [Caustic Nightmare](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Caustic_Nightmare_weapon_skins) weapons, lost-then-found [Mist weapons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mist_weapons) which could give a nice set, [Caladbolg weapons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Caladbolg_weapons) from achievement, released with PoF [Forged Weapons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Forged_weapons), [Dwarven weapons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dwarven_weapons) and so on
---
I dunno, I wish they put more time into tying cool weapon skins into in-game accomplishments, but that would also mean tying more resources into individual releases which might slow things down. That said, the jet pack idea is cool as hell, and I'm sure they could find other ways to capitalize on player activity if they dangled this particular carrot at the end of a longer in-game quest.
---
I roam, it's become hard to gank because of warclaw, but if you wish to duel, you still get them on the usual spots like ruins and sides of smc. In fact warclaw imo brought back more more players to wvw so I found that as a positive. 
---
And the question you're asking is kinda negative imo, don't you think you can use warclaw and engage faster as well? Or disengage..there are times when you get outnumbered roaming and have to leave. But keep in mind you can only do that if you're out of combat, so if you enter into combat with a roamer neither you nor them can mount up and leave until out of combat. 
---
So far I have successfully avoided SAB...
---
so no Cantha for another Half decade.
---
Knowing some games have templates that are free. I would be quite disappointed I would need to pay for them.. it would be ridiculous -.-
---
Plot Twist.. OP actually is leaking potential 3rd xpac content to get feedback before actual announcement  :P
---
It wasn't a 'battle'. They've been working in them for a long time. 
---
Legendary armor
---
They both can be used wherever you want and they are only "skins" for the tags. Note that if you get one you can also get the other one later on for "only" half of the gold (150g iirc) since at that point it's only giving you extra skins.
---
Historically only the one in LA existed (and was even character-bound at the very start) and they added the Catmender a couple year ago now I think.
---
Any macros like that, especially in PvP/WvW [break the ToS](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013762153-Policy-Macros-and-Macro-Use) and should be reported. The only acceptance anet has given is to the macro examples you see there and specific 3rd party apps like [arcdps](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/). Anything else could be violating the ToS and you'd need to give specific examples. Things like [GW2taco](http://www.gw2taco.com/) are overlays that don't interact with the game besides the supported API.
---
It's the same commander tag and works everywhere. You can get catmander tag only in wvw though, but it works in pve as well.
---
Thanks 😊
---
This is probably not a popular opinion here but here goes anyway.
---
Work out how long it takes to make gold. I have read here that 20G/hour is reasonable in Silverwastes. So 200G = about 10 hours but also = 2k gems which cost around $25 from Amazon.
---
How long does it take you to make $25 (if you are a working person - otherwise ignore this post)?
---
PvP Season just started yesterday, if you dont mind spending a little time there you will make money like crazy, if i remember correctly, rewardchests give up to 20g.
---
It is legit, you can go to your account settings (https://account.arena.net/settings) and view the email preferences and gift there.
---
you probably maxed out on daily AP on your account
---
And WTF is that even?
---
Look on youtube for Cellofrags Gold Guide, he explaines it very well.
---
There are no real „famous“ pvp guilds anymore since esl ended.
---
Your best bet would be to write in map chat in HotM and asking for a guild to join, i know that there are several large pvp guilds that are free to join, at least on eu where i play.
---
There is a 15k AP cap on daily (+old monthly) point. Hover over your AP score on achievements tab and it ahould show you its breakdown. If daily+monthly is at 15 k, you hit the cap
---
Ive been a reaper main since HoT release playing almost the exact same build throughout. Small scale roaming/duelling is better balanced now than it used to be in the past imo.
---
Obviously theres still cheese builds out there, which already got mentioned (DE rifle/sb pew)
---
If you pick up one of the current meta/above average builds you shouldnt have a huge problem dealing with most people tho. 
---
As for warclaw ... it basically balanced mobility across the board a little since classes that used to have low to no mobility now can savely disengage from thieves and choose fights themselves.
---
I personally am not a fan of warclaw for roaming and play without it. 
---
Roaming is def not dead or unplayable nowadays so give it a shot ~ /wave
---
There is a max Ap you can get from daily achievements. I belive its around 15 000 AP but even I got above that and now Im sitting on 15 550 AP or so. Wish we could get more =/ 
---
Daily Achievement points are capped at 15K points (this includes Monthlies too). 
---
&gt; The 15000 point cap is shared with the historical and festival Daily and Monthly achievements. [Source](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Achievement)
---
You don't get the lvlup bonuses with instaboost, only if you use tomes
---
YEET?
---
That's dope man
---
be it one free and 800/ea, with discounts similar to those on slots/whatever has the same price tag. We have two kinds of people, those who won't use it because they're running pve with one build only and those, who will use it a lot because it's faster than relogging and they have legendary armor anyway XD  
---
Both arcdps and TacO offer distinct advantage over someone without and If someone wants to hoard a million luck, the that is their problem. These exceptions confound the ambiguity, without AHK, there would be no gathering / AH bots. I for one, don’t download anything that is not from an accredited and accountable source, and won’t even humour something that won’t disclose its sourcecode, which AHK doesn’t, and whilst AHK itself can be ‘trusted’, plenty of Malware requires keyloggers. I could give you the names of 4 bots that have been on the go for the last 18 months, reporting does nothing. If the game did not ship with it, then it wasn’t intended.
---
Subjectively, I wonder how many more accounts are jeopardised during SAB
---
I won't pay 20€ for a skin I can do myself with blender in two hours. Beside I won't give them money just to give them money. I prefer giving money to real local charity nearby and not to developers in the other side of the world. But I want to BUY them their products I enjoy, but there is nothing to buy except 10€ virtual hats.
---
well, isn't that in like 90% the case for any video game?
---
While this is the overall impression of the story and we do seem untouchable by everything we still have some instances in which this is not the case in the PoF Expansion story, the episode "long live the lich" and "all or nothing". But there are also other instances in which we are actually powerless like in the Personal Story "Tower Down" story part (and more importantly the aftermath of this) and in Heart of Thorns Expansion Story.
---
Though I don't really get the same impression as you did. The only time I really got that feeling was when that NPCs in Kourna I was interacting with was like a little fan girl.
---
Timezone
---
One or three slots for free, more buyable. Like everything else, too.
---
Just to clarify, I put these down as my thoughts because I'm genuinely curious as to how other players experience the game. Definitely not a judgement on other players, we all experience stories/movies/books differently. This is no different.
---
Well .... no, it hasn't changed. Where's the difference between the Orr campaign, HoT, and PoF ?
---
* Yolomouse
---
* arcdps
---
* arcdps buildtemplates
---
* arcdps extras (to get rid of story notification)
---
* SCT (scrolling combat text) for arcdps
---
* Mount Wheel (for novelties - I prefer direct keys for mounts)
---
* ReShade Hook with my preset
---
* Autohotkey (for dodgejump)
---
* Taco when necessary
---
I'm currently slowly working towards gearing a Healbrand. Guess I'll speed that up. I got a Healer Druid but I have no fucking clue what I'm doing with that everytime I play it, even when we clear some crazy T4 fractals
---
Great for Bowl of Sweet and Spicy Butternut Squash Soup.
---
I always thought i would be happy about this. Too little too late maybe. Such a core important thing 7 years in, feels really too long. I think if it was released when the wardrobe system came in, we would have all been like...okay it took a long time, but im glad its finally here. This long though, i feel nothing for it. 
---
Also if you get bored at the stories then do others things inbetween. Stores are great and it is good to play up to the last one so you don't have to get spoiled but not to the cost of you quitting because of it. 
---
So add things to do inbetween, like the meta event maps, fractals, dungeons, raids, WvW, sPvP, farming stuff for things you want to craft or gold to get what you really want, level a new class and try that out there are so much you can do then just story.
---
I agree that blanket bans are not the solution, although given the very nature of keylogged events, if someone is nailing a rotation; absoultely; every single time, without a millisecond deviation; then clearly they are using software to do so.
---
Hi folks, I'm a casual PvE player and I've just started playing again after a long absence.  I have a character in the Silver Wastes with nearly a hundred Bandit Skeleton Keys in inventory.  However, when I try to open a Lost Bandit Chest I get a message saying that I have to have a Bandit Skeleton Key before I can open it.
---
Is this something that other have experienced and resolved or do I need to contact support for something like this?
---
Best f2p class for WvW with 200ping ??
---
Imagine doing Qadim with 5 players.
---
1. Most roamers operate in enemy territory, so it would rarely ever be helpful.
---
2. Speed is useless at helping to engage an enemy, unless you're ganking with a group and want to stop them escaping (not real roaming), which leads to..
---
3. Speed will simply encourage roamers to reset fights that they are losing and then return, thus giving an edge to less skilled roamers.
---
4. If a ganks squad jumps me, im usually already in combat and war claw isn't going to save me then anyway. 
---
To me it sounds like they listen to players who just want to zerg and were willing to ensure they are able to return to the karma train without any fear of trouble from solo/smaller groups. 
---
That may be actually the way to expand fractals beyond level 100; devs could either adjust already existing instances to include 5 more people (mechanics that could include for example working in 2 teams each 5 man, different mobs, instabilities etc.) or prepare new ones 
---
Yeah, without a faster sickle skin/animation, Industry makes a lot more sense.
---
That was horribly disappointing, no expansion , living world episodes might not even give new maps anymore, "the future" was small QoL updates....
---
No, it's always been that stupid.
---
Some time ago they changed keys to work from the wallet, you need to consume the keys to add them to your wallet, then you should be able to open the chests
---
the TP and the gem/gold conversion is the same in EU/NA. they are not split.
---
should i save rares / exotics gears and weapons to use on mystic forge? or just salvage to get ecto?
---
We need a parametabolic primer so it can last 144 hours.

Yes, that would be my statement about. Maybe the problem is with me, but I don't really get hyped up about discipline updates or recipes. Plus I think that the rune sigil option will be a bit boring: your sigil can have any sigil form you wish, that's all, otherwise they will create a progression System that they denied in the opening paragraph of the post. 
---
Ho, thanks a lot, I had missed that post (I mean saw it, did not have time to read it so postponed and obviously forgot about it lol).
---
Good news indeed :)
---
Tend to agree. I usually don't like this sort of stuff but at least this is lore friendlier than some of the other sab stuff ( as in, you can see it's projected into the world in this sort of holo-vr booth ). And overall it's just really nicely designed. 
---
"Hey, look! These two otherwise entirely unrelated things are blue/have the same number/look like [animal]! It's totally a reference!"
---
No, it's not. That's not how that works. References, by their very nature, are required to be somewhat specific.
---
If this were legit I’d buy two copies. Hope anet is taking notes here, this is exactly what’s needed to save the game in its current state.
---
The gemstore (and the TP in general) loads slowly for everyone I think lol 
---
be careful, you might piss off all the carebears who have been sitting pretty in their masterwork gear for the past 7 years
---
Do you want to gamble or instant profit?
---
Not I this community. You criticize anet at all and the place falls apart. I think the worst part about it is the communities amnesia about the past. 
---
Forging is best done with large quantities of the same weapon. So unless you have tons of swords or such lying around, I would just salvage and move on. 
---
If you want to do MF gambles, buy the weapons you need off TP. 
---
I always do this, but they mostly ignore it.
---
10 bodies allows for more interesting mechanics than 5 bodies does.  
---
This is fucking fantastic! Absolutely loved the new icons for Elite Specs as well, so much potential :)
---
You always open all unidentified gear to have a chance on upgrading. Even though without magic find you get less rares/exotics. You should still aim to get as many as possible of them, especially with ectoplasm prices rising!
---
Is core engineer any good in WvW for Zerg if not which other class should I play ? Indian player with 200ping
---
Getting 5k AP and doing a little bit of research on the dungeon was much easier than getting 250 Li or 250 kp for fractals, which is absolutely insane to me. 
---
There was one addon I believe specially for Gryphon. It basicaly added an extra bar above the stamina bar that showed your current speed while flying. Anyone know which one is that?
---
That is not true. They were much more open in 2016 about the stuff going on. We knew about expac 2 coming before they even started working on it. 
---
It's the crater of Mount Maelstrom during Great Destroyer event.
---
try wintraders.eu probably best guild around.
---
What I'm saying is that some druids have so much toughness gear that the chrono does not get the aggro.
---
What would be interesting to see, if they add upgrades to Mist trinkets (available in 3 game modes). In a similar vain to upgrading the WvW and PVP armors.  
---
Potential legendary trinkets with no special look.
---
I know people would spend a lot of time for the slight benefit of not having to get that reset item
---
To be fair some of them aren't worth anything at all. This can only go up right?
---
I totally disagree, not with the armory but with your interpretation of this.
---
The game should not lose the equipment aspect and the attributes connected with it. How exactly are you imagining this? If you can select a stat combination like the wardrobe system you are basically saying that you unlock an attribute combination once and then don't have to ever again. With that you are making having and gathering equipment obsolete.
---
No, I think the inconvenience should still be there. You got a legendary armour that is also a lot more convenient and only have to put it into your bank and equip it with your other profession if it is the same armour class.
---
With light berserker and viper you could try necromancer. Both reaper and scourge are fairly easy to learn, so you can focus on the boss mechanics rather than your rotation.
---
Light minstrel and commander still have a place on chronomancer. You can take minstrel to bosses that are hard to tank on low toughness such as desmina, vg, qadim, statues and escort. Of course, you can tank all of them on lower toughness but if you are new there is no harm in starting in minstrel and gradually lowering your toughness as you get more practice. You can also mix commanders and berserkers for tanking in general. I'm pretty sure that diviner+knight is more efficient than commander+berserker but let's be honest, the difference in pugs is negligible. Anyway, you still need the highest toughness on some bosses in order to take aggro and commanders does the job.
---
Light viper also allows you to play mirage, the best in slot condi class on some encounters. Therefore you should keep the light vipers gear in case you want to play mirage at some point.
---
For medium berserker i recommend holosmith, daredevil or deadeye. Holo's rotation is of medium difficulty as you will have to understand how engineer kits work. I'm pretty sure that there is a no-kit holo guide out there but i don't know much about it. Daredevil is incredibly strong on some bosses (e.g. sloth, samarog, qadim) due to the combination of high power dps, strong cc and their stolen skills. The rotation is very easy but you need some time to get used to a rotation with dodges as part of your rotation. Dagger deadeye is also very easy to learn. You have strong single target dps with some optional cc (basilisk venom) and decent cleave if timed well (shadow flare). Rifle deadeye has no cleave and basically no cc unless you want to shoot yourself in the foot. The rotation is somewhat difficult not do much because it is hard to remember but hard to execute. I would recommend other classes first.
---
Yeah don't have expansions. Are warrior n guardian playable in WvW with my ping ??
---
I wouldnt mind unlocking legendaries on all chars when you unlock it once though. Its rather annoying to constantly move legendary gear around.
---
Just got into LW season 4 recently and I have episode 1,2, and 5 for now (I think the rest will be unlocked soon). What is a good way to farm VM without me going insane?
---
It’s not useful if you have different builds and classes.
---
This game will never have a pure healer style class as it was one of the things they announced before the game was launched. No holy trinity.
---
No shit, Sherlock.
---
its working version, someone gave this link too soon :)
---
I will correct the error, thank you for your attention.
---
If there are other errors, I am waiting for comments.
---
It will be interesting what will happen to arc build templates then. How can they effectively monetize something that is already free? I am happy with the functions that arc offers for free. 
---
And if they ban arc suddenly there will be an outcry aswell
---
5+ years, 20+ chars, still here and excited about the *official* implementation.
---
Stop living in the past, sjeez. Go play GW1 if it suits your needs better. No one is forcing you to play GW2.
---
# WARNING: Spoilers Below! 
---
**I'm not using a spoiler tag because I don't wanna break the formatting, but you have been warned!**
---
I mean... no, exactly the opposite. Have you like... even played the recent stories? Yes we kill a God in PoF, but we've [done that before](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Abaddon%27s_Gate), and even fought (twice) what many consider the literal embodiment of [Death](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dhuum) itself (who is, being death, unkillable). 
---
Even in the first couple episodes of PoF, you're making a decision (whether to ally with Joko, the Sunspears, or stay neutral) that lots of people are gonna call you an idiot for. You only survive because a grandson of an elder dragon literally takes a hit for you. The main Big Bad literally kills you proving that you are not, in fact, unkillable.
---
It gets even worse in post-PoF Living World, where Joko (quite rightly) points out that killing Elder Dragons willy-nilly without replacements was really stupid of you, you end up losing *two* major allies, and at the end of the most recent episode, your response to "What do we do now?" (because like it or not, you do have a leadership role) is "I don't know".
---
Not game wise, player wise it does.
---
And if you can't understand that's not my fault. 
---
I'm preordering but it's not talking my money?!?
---
Everywhere is world 3 now, the adventure continues outside the box
---
Why are you always so negative? They literally just announced that they'll be released in the future.
---
&gt;The only time I really got that feeling was when that NPCs in Kourna I was interacting with was like a little fan girl.
---
Fair enough, but considering you did kill two Elder Dragons, I'm sorta surprised that no one else is like, "Hey, this person's pretty awesome!". 
---
&gt; Plus not everyone is happy adding things like 3rd party tools
---
Definitely not something that can eat my gear any next patch.
---
No, they've never outright confirmed they're working on build templates before this post. Feel free to correct me if you can find a source.
---
I rarely purchase skins or outfits because it feels unrewarding. I want my character to look cool, but also show off my acomplishments.
---
The most fun I've had in GW2 so far was getting the griffon. It felt like an mmo quest should feel, taking me on a grand journey across several zones before rewarding me with something unique. Precursor collections are like that too. 
---
I expect there's a lot of people who would be opposed to paywalled pve content aside from expansions, but I'd be willing to pay for a quest like that instead of just a skin.
---
The difference is you can actually achieve 250 LI/KP much faster, and it actually is much more relevant to the content. AP is a bad indicator.
---
Is the NPC still available now? If yes, where? Unfortunately I missed it during the festival.
---
Hah, like WvW Alliances, right? Soon™ 
---
so like Foundry and Oil metas on Thunderpeaks and the like?
---
Power is the one which burns away all the Mount's health in an instant.
---
Condi is gradual decay which can be resetted in the manner I explained above. 
---
Condi just straight up sucks vs Mounts because of the amount of distance the player can travel before stopping to cleanse themselves. 
---
Also the health of a Mount is large enough that small bits of Condition only chip it, and big bursts are needed to take it down faster.
---
Using big bursts of condi on a mount means the player essentially used Mount health to shield the burst used on him and he can retaliate immediately when the Condi player is on cooldown.
---
Power builds which can effectively range down a mount are mostly 1200 range which does around 2k - 4k damage per shot using autos. 
---
It's much more efficient if yu burst down a mount with a power build. 
---
I hope that if we ever get GW3 we can do away with rectangular areas surrounded by mountains. It's my most hated thing in game worlds. Why are there sudden mountains IN THE DESERT!? At least in old GW it was blocked by other stuff like rubble from ruins
---

---
Since it is so old *chuckle* It doesn't exist anymore but i found the cache of the old website before they purged and reworked.
---
Bizarrely, this annoys me less than custom mount skins. At least this is technically lore friendly - it's a hologram.
---
The supernova and glowing celestial griffons though? They bug the hell out of me.
---
I hope that when they do release build templates there will be some form of build storage with it.  Even if it means permanently binding a stat set to my account/char.  If build templates are in game I would probably use them more and I just hate carrying around a loads of stuff.
---
They shouldve at least made it affected by your base magic find (read: UNBUFFED, factored only by your achievement + account magic find). They just destroyed magic find as a whole with this.
---
Remember how long legendary armor took? WvW alliance? How HoT was supposed to have all gen 2 legendaries? 
---
Well it's not like massive projects like that take a lot of time and effort or anything.
---
Hello everybody, im a new player here...so im looking for some guides to lvlup anyone who have that? That can help me....the lvlup is kinda confuse, um with the base game...should i buy the expansions already or stick with the base game to know the basics things and then buy them? I have lvl 9 human warrior...any advice ? I heard that have story quests and sides quests....how can i distinguish them? Can you guys help me?
---
Best regards,
---
Hélder
---
That's not an outright confirmation. It's an 'expressed interest'. Spit-balling ideas with the community isn't the same as 'already been in development for some time'.
---
Impressive sleuthing, but my head stays warm.
---
As you mentioned crafting, let me tell you that it is absolutely possible to make money that way. It is quite safe and fast but low profit. This means that over time you will accumulate more and more gold but you're not getting 500g per day unless your starting gold is already 10k. Also, it is perfectly doable if you only have 1-2 hours per day.
---
A starting gold of 30 is quite low. You don't need a lot to get started but with this little gold you are very limited in your options. Therefore i recommend doing daily fractals first. They are doable in less than an hour in most pugs. Doing cms adds some extra gold from encryptions, mystic coins, ecto and exotic equipment (salvage for insignia/inscription). Dailies yield about 20g per day so if you do them for about a week you should have well over 150g total which is enough to get started on making money on the tp via crafting.
---
If you are interested in details you can go to r/gw2economy but the idea behind it is basically this, buy unrefined materials (e.g. platinum ore), refine it (into platinum/darksteel ingots) and list those on the trading post. That's the most simple thing you can do. You can also get into sigil/rune crafting, food crafting, dye cooking or whatever really. Refining basic materials is just the easiest and usually fastest way to make gold albeit the profit can sometimes be low. You can also buy salvage items (e.g. filthy hides), salvage them and then sell or refine for profit. This usually takes longer as some salvage items (especially mid tier items) really take a long time to buy. Also, you would want drop tables for each of them depending on the used salvage kit or else it's impossible to calculate the profit.
---
In order to know which items are profitable to craft you want spreadsheets that are linked to the gw2 api. You can either set them up yourself or ask someone that has them already and is willing to distribute them. You can technically calculate everything manually but that really consumes a lot of time in the long run. On gw2bltc you can find informations regarding crafting cost and profit of each craftable item so you can look it up there too.
---
If you have spare spirit shards you can also upgrade materials in the mystic forge. On gw2efficiency -&gt; currencies -&gt; spirit shards you can find profitable materials. Don't bother with the craftable weapons at first, they can be pretty profitable but they usually sell quite slowly and you need dungeon tokens for most of them. Rather focus on materials like leather, wood, metal, t6 trophies (blood, fangs etc.) and lodestones. If you want fast money go for higher tier items (e.g. buy t5 items and forge them into t6). Why? Because they come in fast as they are high in supply and t6 items sell fast because they are high in demand. Also, they require fewer "crafting materials" per spirit shard. Iirc you need 250 t5 leather squares per spirit shard but 2500 or 5000 (not sure) bolts of jute for 1 spirit shard. If you were to refine t1 into t2 ask yourself this. Who would sell t1 materials? It only really drops in low level zones and most players are level 80. Sure, they do come in buy you need a ton of t1 items to even make 1 gold profit.
---
Or just have side story.
---
If you don't have fun little adventures that had some effort put into them occasionally, all the big stuff gets dull.
---
tldr: where is the expansion?
---
2 hours is enough. Welcome to laundry list wars
---
1. Check /wiki et and look up if shatterer/death branded shatterer (if more active hour), istan meta, AB meta is up, any of the three you'll jump in and do them. If not, go to 3. Max 20 min.
---
2. Look at guild roster and with members you trust, speedrun Fractals t4s (t3s is fine too). Max 1 hour. After this go 4.
---
3. Look for any "vw" or vinewrath from the silverwaste if meta about to start. Can do a full RIBA meta in like 45 min. Then do 2.
---
4. Quickly browse PvP, PvE, WvW to see which daily is the fastest. Just hit 3 for the 2g.
---
So kitchen math, meta event 2-10g + fractal 10~15g + daily 2g. Min 14g or Max 27g per day. It's the best I came up with for 2 hour tops.
---
Shhhhhhh don't give them ideas!!! 
---
There uh... seems to be an issue with the checkout page, no matter how often I tried yesterday and today, it uh... didn't let me buy it. Please correct the issue asap, I need it.
---
Or you want to have a mount early
---
Yes.
---
This is correct, but your pvp build is already changed when you enter it. You could save multiple builds in each mode of the game. multiple Raidbuilds and multiple PvPbuilds.
---
Yeah I know, but it wasn't as jarring as it is here
---
&gt; Making Racial Skills viable but not making it viable
---
Lel
---
I like your design thesis a lot, about the importance of the legend, the uniqueness of its role, etc. I would love to see Arenanet's design documents for how they consider the process when crafting an elite spec.
---
I like the application of Greatsword as a hybrid support weapon. it would really give the feeling of a larger-than-life Hero on the frontline Sounds like a crazy amount of fun for WvW.
---
The only real criticism I can think of - and let me know if you thought of this - but doesn't the banner system kind of step on the toes of the Renegade's F2-F4? It seems awfully similar to me; it would be like Elementalist getting another spec that can "overload" their attunements, but with different effects. I think a way to make the banners more unique would be to treat them like attunements, in that you're always pulsing out some passive effect from the one you have selected. Maybe you could even tie that into the glyph-like abilities that your spirit abilities have, in that they could combo with your current banner as well as your weapon. It would give the Vanquisher a hell of a lot more variety than any other Revenant playstyle.
---
Overall, I'm impressed, and I love the idea of a aggressive and visceral frontline support spec for Renegade, one that supports more the more aggressive they are in melee. 
---
Also I love the Braveheart GM
---
Damn thats sweet! It annoys me that I need to manualy change everything when I just run open world or fractals etc. Now I see why everyone is so hyped about it! Now I join the ”cant wait!” -gang!
---
Thank you so much for your answer Biestosaurus_Hax!!
---
To each their own; I'm with you man.  I'm a new player and I did exactly this.  Bought PoF/HoT on sale last week, started a Ranger and found that running around was slow af.  Boosted a mesmer to 80, spent a couple hours getting a build going and learning how to play it (mesmer is crazy fun!) and then got my Mount and Glider unlocked.  
---
Now leveling on my Ranger is much more enjoyable.  I won't play the Mesmer again until my Ranger is also 80 (I can't wait!).
---
I feel like [this pic](https://imgur.com/gallery/E5slr5K) is pretty relevant here. 
---
It isnt too bad compared to spellbreaker, but spellbreaker isnt that good in large scale to begin with. It gets countered way too easily at which point you can get another scourge or weaver/tempest and have more damage/support and more corrupts/cc. In case of f2p, an ele is already a lot more useful than warr, or engi/guard when it comes to support.
---
Banner means nothing when warclaw stomp is a thing and 99% of players have warclaw. Not to mention that radius and cooldown on it are a joke.
---
Nice try, Mr. I-bought-a-truckload-of-cauliflower.
---
As long as this game is not subscription based, I will never complain about paid cosmetics and the like.  The devs gotta get their support somehow.  I do still want good items you have to build yourself, but I understand why they make so many paid skins.
---
so they won the battle against their spaghetti code? implementing something like this is super basic and shouldnt be a problem.
---
EU or NA? Would love a guild to do dungeons with.
---
[selfless potion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Selfless_Potion) :3
---
First link was the same as before, an [expressed interest](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4fkhku/reddit_ama_summary/d29wn74/) rather than a statement that it was in active development.
---
The 2nd link just stated that templates would not come with PoF but were 'on the table' which, again, amounts to an expressed interest. Plenty of stuff throughout the years has been on the infamous table and whilst we've long suspected build templates have been worked on in the background, we've never had explicit confirmation until now due to ANet's post-HoT 'show don't tell' policy.
---
It hasn't been killed, it has always been this way. Over time you just stop caring about the storytelling because it's clearly not for me.
---
Still forced to play though it despite dull story and even duller gameplay to access the reward tracks. 
---
Gors is very easy to lead if you find good dps. First 3 bosses of wing 4 are also easy to lead. All can be done with condi, even gors.
---
Thank you.
---
Snap back into reality, oh there goes gravity
---
I mostly watched the videos on dulfy, youtube if you need more videos. 
---
Yeah, I'd rather not use an officially unsupported third party application that probably wont (but just might) delete my legendary gear.
---
This just feels like them buying some time and goodwill.
---
The "new" features aren't that exciting. Some small vertical progression with, I guess, a huge timesink in legendary sigils.
---
New raid is moved again after episode 6 which will bring it to june or something. The last raid was in september 2018 and they said it'll be 4 wings in a year, which is not a lot to begin with and they actually managed to only release 4 wings in the last 2 years.
---
Kind of happy you guys are excited but I'm not. I'm running out of things to hold on, like, you know, content to play were I'm not already bored to death from doing it so often.
---
Since you don’t have time to play, you’re probably working all day. So just buy gems and convert to gold. 
---
It can't, it's a meme.
---
GW1's build templates stored all the information you needed in a ~30 character string. It also didn't touch equipment at all, only skills and attributes, which were discretely placed in ~8 lines from 0 to 12. That's it. Do you really think they could get away with such a simple system in GW2?
---
Stop comparing the two games. GW2 builds are exponentially more complex than GW1's.
---
Nothing new. Same boring game Barbie dress up game. 
---
The writing is slightly better in HOT and POF I guess. At least you don't cringe *that* much compared to the original campaign. 
---
&gt; That's my personal preference though. Playing the world saving hero over and over and over again is dull for me.
---
Well I don't necessarily disagree, but Anet don't have much recourse now that they have committed to the epic hero narrative. 
---
&gt; Be the understated Tolkienesque hero for once. Is that too much to ask?
---
The irony here is that all of Tolkien's heroes are far more exceptional individuals than your character in GW2 world is. It's just that his universe works on different principles and thus different qualities are valued. Of course he didn't put much weight into the munchkin superhero tropes. 
---
Saving gear templates is the big one. Arc is a hack, a great hack but it's not what they would release as an official product.
---
New player here and after the third post about unid gear i still dont know what to do with them xD
---
&gt; Without them I would spend so much time swapping traits
---
Yeah imagine all the things you're gonna do with the 5 seconds it takes to do that.
---
Do you really think they are going to announce an expansion in a post like this?
---
&gt; I put it down years ago and won't bother to pick it up until you fix the  performance.  Want more money?  Game needs to be playable. 
---
I very much agree but this community is too reluctant that everything is "fine" and focus on fluff and not the core problems. Instead we have memes like build templates that are praised. For what exactly? The few dudes who switch in raids and have done so for the past few years by hand or with arcdps build templates?
---
It still is a nice feature but man, so worthless for the bigger picture or newcomers.
---
Engine development has been dead for months/years. I legitimately wonder if there's truly a core engine dev left. In which case, I wonder what he's doing.
---
Other companies are rewriting their renderers left and right with spectacular results and GW2 is still chugging along with the same problems as vanilla.
---
It's just sad because the artists are great and have to put all their stuff in an outdated engine. By now, even factually outdated. DX9 is dead and doesn't play nice with modern GPUs.
---
Do you wanna be called Poo-Bah?
---
I dont wanna be called Poo-Bah. 
---
^(Also we cant let Taimi have that one)
---
Ahh ok, I was looking for mount skins with supernova in the name but I see what you mean now.
---
So essentially the GW2 version of Paragon?  I dig it!
---
What war? People dont have build templates right now if they dont want to. It's more than common knowledge at this point where to get them without any problem
---
Can you expand on point 1? You are using a lot of terms that I am not aware of :D
---
Well, again... the lay-offs were the end result. They decided to go from Season 4 to Season 5 without an expansion is because they were working on that secred (and now deleted) project. So they didn't have time to make an expansion after PoF. That's basically the same. The lay-offs happaned becuase of the results of that new project. If that new project didn't exist we would have an expac announcement, I'm sure of it. 
---
That got scrapped by NCSOFT
---
I bet you're German
---
No doubt that is true, but that's a problem in and of itself isn't it? 
---
It's still a joke no matter what day they post it
---
wanting to compete and being casual are mutually exclusive things.
---
is there only 1 raid difficulty? 
---
When was the last time you played? I have the sneaking suspicion that you don't know that the last expansion took us to Elona and every Living World episode since season 3 added a new explorable map.
---
Was about to say this then saw your post.  Mesmer can do it too.  People don’t realize the activation window for the hallway terminals is long.  Something like 3 seconds to activate.
---
Indeed. Gearing new characters should always require more gear.
---
And unless your gear is legendary, switching stats and upgrades should have a cost.
---
Even if there was a way to craft replicas of legendary items, and  even if stats and upgrades can be unlocked for the account and then loaded up on your equipment, players should always need to spend.  
---
So to craft legendary replicas of legendary items already unlocked, they should need to get ascended gear, and materials to craft the replica.   
---
And to have a gearing system that can unlock stats and upgrades and load them up on gear in the equipment panel and with templates, unless the gear is legendary, there has to be a cost to switch that is high enough to keep the economy healthy, and low enough not to make it pointlessly expensive.
---
And it would be better if there was 'gear loadouts', presets of gear that store the gear in its own space.  
---
Even if we were able to swap stats in gear, it should be something people to not too often to try new builds and it woud be too expensive to do it before every encounter in a raid.  
---
Then have loadouts for actual quick gear swaps to monetize the system, as people would be able to get 2 for free, then buy more in the gemstore, either as character upgrades like bags, or as account upgrades.
---
"Unlock and forget" only works when there's a huge upfront cost and multiple items to be obtained, like with legendary gear. 
---
Would also make maps a lot busier yea. My main is waiting at 400 cooking for some new exciting stuff tbh.
---
Does arc let you generate a chat code to share builds with other people?  ^_^
---
&gt;Weapon: While Asgeir is depicted with sword and shield (and we already have those in case of Revenant)
---
Just a small add, shield is for Glint, which is for Herald, an elite spec. It doesn't exclude different elite spec wielding shield, as you can't have two elite specs at once.
---
It’s shadow blue, so it’s not even really black, just a really dark blue, and yeah I think I’ll use grey or some other shade of blue instead. Guess I’ll recolour, delete this post, then reupload with a comparison to see if it looks any better. 
---
I think the blue that I am using is sky, am not sure tho, can’t check rn cause I’m at work :( 
---
Water combat has been forgotten..
---
Me and my friends have three-manned all story modes. We've tried some explorable paths too, and I think most of them are do-able. Some have puzzles where you need more than three though
---
That is true.
---
I've been also thinking about glyph-style mechanics, but so far I've come up with nothing.
---
Superficial vanity and shallow victory triumph.
---
Legendary Mount: the RapGrifHopJackSkim Roller
---
True, but I was hesitant with going in that direction until Anet gives us precedent with that.
---
I personally think this looks great. Awesome contrast to make the blue stand out
---
Ah, yes. I was thinking of doing Spear as well, but just couldn't come up with something unique so thought I'd put that on hold.
---
Why not just ad the other image to this post as an update? Before and afters are always fun to look at!
---
ah yes, the sequel to BuildWars! I've been waiting 10 years xD
---
We're still (obviously) the center of the story, and, as long as we live (woups) we succeed in what we throw ourselves into. The last chapter is the first ever in the game to take a different path.
---
Remember kids, proper dying is for suckers. Always use the most saturated colours you can find! The ONLY good combo is the blackest black and the whitest white!
---
I'm glad someones excited about it. After acquiring 20+ char slots so I can stop swapping builds I'm kinda just amused about the whole thing. Don't get me wrong, once it's done I'm sure I will definitely use it, it's just.... I'll believe it when I see it really...
---
Try darkness.
---
Dunno... then anything that isn't god damn pitch black. You can't even see a single texture on the shoulders...
---
Yeah I guess so, just can’t be on GW2 rn so I’m asking here instead. I do have some midnight dyes, I’ll give those a try as soon as I can. 
---
It happened to me when I went hardcore tribulation mode 2 years ago.
---
Jumping at the wrong time does make you touch the ceiling spikes. It's a terribly frustrating way to die.
---
Fair enough! Maybe standard black is already good enough, it's hard to tell without a clone of your character. Hence the "preview it yourself", that there was a question that we can't really answer. 
---
your probably 15 years irl
---
&gt; saving you storage space.
---
which is the reason the dont do it
---
While true, it's only like 99,9% safe. 
---
I can't recall anyone ever coming forward on reddit with a severe Arcdps template issue, but if it were to happen, Anet won't intervene.
---
They will with the official build templates though.
---
I wait of respond from test
---
I always delete posts that I don’t need anymore advice on, to keep my inbox clean. 
---
And yeah blue is the SHIT. I actually like more realistic looking  Charr, she is the only exception, my other characters are mostly brown/grey/dark red. And my druid, who I also made blue-glowy, just so that people can easily spot me to get a heal, otherwise she’d be a different colour too. 
---
Literally no one would have complained about a autoclicker trait and skill only version of templates until they are ready to add equipment.
---
Your attitude is a joke. Don't like the game? Stop playing it and stop putting others down.
---
For open world plebs with only one power set, no. But for people who raid or do fractals it's a major thing. On my necro I swap between power, condi, heal and condiheal hybrid builds frequently and it would be hell to manually swap skills trinkets, equipment and runes every single time.
---
It's called "What's next for GW2", at least teasing it would be expected.
---
What did we get instead? Repeating the same stuff they keep saying every other year and they never bring. "Our WvW, PVP, Rewards and Balance teams are doing cool stuff". Then the "cool" stuff never comes.
---
The nitpickiness of the critique that this game recieves is astonishing.
---
If they decide to monetize this (which I assume they will, since it most likely is a resource heavy development) I do hope they do it in the indirect way, like they did with mounts. Make it cost gold, incentivize players to play the game to get more slots. The players who don’t want to play/grind can go for the gem-&gt;gold conversion route. 
---
I feel that putting a feature like this in the gemstore will upset a lot of players instead of making them excited, which I don’t think anyone gains from.
---
"only"
---
If this gets monetised, arcdps will be shutdown, and I will be incredibly mad. Like, possibly quit-the-game levels of mad. I have a slightly modified build for like, every other raid boss, depending on whether I'm tanking (and how much toughness I may need to tank - lots like on VG, Twins, SH? Little like Gorse, KC?), what my offhands are (mobs need pulling? focus. need CC? pistol), what the runes are (full dps? scholars. nothing special required? pack. Need protection for the final phase of Dhuum? herald. tanking hard? sanctuary/durability). What about the condi fights, where I can run the trailblazer/viper builds for support Mesmer? Completely different set up in every slot, even down to infusions. What about niche builds, like solo-ing the Towers on Escort? Or being able to run around Twisted Castle with Chaos, mimic and portal? I really could go on and on... and on and on... for ONE class (mesmer) running ONE role (support chronomancer) in ONE game mode (raids), let alone mentioning Fractals, open world and WvW (roaming vs zerging).
---
ArcDPS is a god send for managing all these changes on-the-fly, without me needing a perfect memory to recall all the slight changes. And I see people here suggesting "Ahyuck, I'd be happy if they gave us 1 free build template slot and we could buy extra ones" - like, holy shit! The idea of "build slots" is not going to cut it! This needs to be like GW1 where you can have an infinite number of builds stored in text strings. ArcDPS can do this!
---
Reminds me of my zealot in return of reckoning.
---
Idunno, I'm highly inexperienced at fractals, and even though I consider myself a pretty decent player by open world standards, even in T1 there's an unspoken expectation that you're already familiar with the various mechanics and how they work, as well as what your role should be.
---
Not saying all groups are like this, or that being clueless will draw anger...but I am always leery when I see the advice given you a newbie of "withhold that information".
---
Even in open world, I used to tag up for the AB meta almost every night. I'd ask if we had any newbies with us and if so I'd be happy to explain what to do.
---
It was a common thing for nobody to speak up, then once we were in, you'd have a few people who did nothing but run up to the vine and auto attack it the whole time, even when shielded...or worse, they'd pull the frogs agro off our armors and kite them right into the group doing a burn.
---
Sometimes, I'd get their name and whisper them after the meta to explain how to be better next time, but it was usually a lost cause. Still, I'd have much prefered them to just be open and honest about their inexperience. It's not a crime to be new at something.
---
Hello all! I've just jumped back in the game along w my hubby after about... 5 years? We had to buy both PoF and HoT (those cutscenes were **g r o o v y** omg)
---
Now, I play mostly elementalist and even after buying all the traits and checking I have the gear stats and weapons I need to (seems the meta is kinda the same than 5 years ago) I don't feel like the glass cannon I used to be. I'm more of a glass nerf gun? This esp in WvW which I used to *love* but now feels like torture, esp not having the mount yet. I'm just dragging behind the rest of the group and will die immediately even in 1v1. I feel like a supplies mule.
---
Can anyone suggest a site or guide where I can check what's missing?
---
Ah, okay. I remember them doing that, but couldn't recall when.
---
So, my thoughts:
---
- new LW seasons and no expansion. Which means no money. New shiny appearances in Gem-store are the only source of money earnings in the future. 3rd year in a row. How do they plan to maintain the game and the studio? Sometimes I really feel like ANet just don't need money. They feel OK where they are, with a slow tiny progress of the game.
---
- some mechanics/features adjustments/tweaks and no new features. Yeah, they said "...build templates. You've noticed we're working on them. Several months. Or maybe longer. But we're working on them. No announcements, but we're working. Now you know." Doesn't look like something to expect in near future, if you ask me.
---
- no new maps, but probably some tweaks and changes to old ones. Although I like this, because I've seen sooo many empty old maps in all MMOs and it really feels like a waste of time and resources actually when devs are making these maps and then the maps are turning into abandoned deserts. GW2's "living world" approach is what exactly should be "no walk-through-and-forget maps", so it's a good decision. However, we all understand why they actually choose this way now. Sad but true.
---
Conclusion: sad to say that, but I don't see any "hype" worthy stuff here, I only see "we don't bury the game, we'll continue to maintain it, don't expect anything special nor significant, just be sure server hamsters are still alive".
---
SAB is cool as a contained thing, I think. But having it be a prevalent thing in the rest of the game would not have my preference. 
---
Hopefully nowhere
---
How would they even look? I feel they would require thier own seperate rigging and animation; alot of extra work for a skin.
---
You can't go wrong with stuff that sells at almost merchant price (cooking ingredients, sigils and orbs before their rework, etc) because even if anet doesn't touch them and their value never increases you can always merch them and get most of your gold back. 
---
This is not counting the opportunity cost of having stuff stored, though is still nice for those that want to make a profit with barely any risk involved.
---
On one hand it’s neat watching the map slowly open up more but on the other I remember getting *very* tired of drytop/silver waste after a couple releases.
---
People downvoted this, but I think it's the most reasonable solution. The game already has a lot of currencies, we don't really NEED another thing to hold on to. Might as well get the convenience of not as much clicking as the reward for maxing out luck.
---
No matter how I imagine what those mounts could look like, they would be ugly and/or unwieldy.
---
A true fashion warrior never reaches endgame.
---
Oh woops I apologize for the jargons
---
If you type "/wiki et" on chat, it's the command to search on the guild wars 2 wiki for event timers (hence the e and t).
---
Point 1 is about effectively go into a successful meta event map. You'll use the event timers, then with the in-game LFG (default key is 'y') you can search if there's a "map taxi" recruiting more people into the map. When looking at the /wiki et page, look under the "World Bosses" category, you'll see a brighter pink line where it shows you the timers for "Tequatl the Sunless" in Sparkfly Fen. If you scroll down under "Auric Basin", only join the map when it says Challenge. Or if you scroll down more you'll see "Domain of Istan" where "Palawadan" starts, which you can catch as well. Lastly, under "Jahai Bluffs" you can also catch the Death-branded Shatterer, join the map during "escorts".
---
Hope that clarified a 'lil

ahh, i didn't know

A good solo volatile magic farm I like to do is the mount path runs in Thunderhead Peaks. I'll make my way to [Dragon's Claw](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragon%27s_Claw_(point_of_interest)), collecting Dragon Crystal Nodes and the Iron Node farm along the way, hop on my roller beetle until its endurance bar is full and use skill 1 of my [Prototype Position Rewinder](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prototype_Position_Rewinder), quickly hop back on and follow the volatile magic path down and then use the 2nd skill of the rewinder to return to where I started before the timer runs out.
---
Then I'll backtrack a bit up to [Sorrow's Cave](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sorrow%27s_Cave) and use my springer or griffon to collect that volatile magic. Then I'll exit south and use my griffon to collect the volatile magic in the air, along with the Platinum Node farm, following it all the way down to [Maiden's Veil](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Maiden%27s_Veil), which is northwest of the waypoint. Then I'll hop on my skimmer and follow that volatile magic trail to the end while also grabbing any nearby Dragon Crystal Nodes.
---
I do this on two characters, and I'll usually hit the open world volatile magic cap by the time I near the Platinum Node farm on my 2nd character. It earns me about 4 trophy shipments for a relatively quick run that doesn't require me to be in a group.
---
They would probably look funky but I imagine a lot of the potential rigging issues could be solved by just using floating blocks rather than a full bodied creature
---
I use arc all the time.  Its great, but the build templates still have some problems.  For example, swapping weapons will often get screwed up if your swapping weapons from a/b + c/d to a/b + a/d.
---
Also super slow build swap times inside of raids (although very fast swap times inside aerodrome).  
---
And lastly, anytime someone crashes repeatedly inside raids, there is a reason everyone tells them to uninstall arcdps.  
---
No. Just no. Worst character in all of Guild Wars history.
---
I am smitten with delight at these. Thank you!
---
I don't think we'd get a Cthulhu helmet -- inclined to think the devs want each elite spec to get a different armor piece, and since Reapers got the helm...sadness. I will weep for the lost-even-though-we-never-had Cthulhu tentacle helm.
---
do you know what days it typically runs?
---
Chrono, Druid, and whatever else if you want to take fractals seriously. That covers pretty much everything, and then you can fill the rest with DPS pugs.
---
Corals are not plants.
---
At least bring back the ability to play LS Season 1.
---
Replace the scythe for Nevermore, it clashes too much with your outfit.
---
What they will most likely do is outcompete the arc version and win by good business with a better product. 
---
Check GW2BLTC, the [price and demand has already gone up](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/item/12532-Head-of-Cauliflower)
---
Main problem I see, other than the fact that Anet hates underwater content, is that mounts are a PoF specific feature. Historically, expansion specific features do not branch across to other expansion releases. 
---
For instance, you can glide *only* if you own HoT. You can use mounts, even LS or core content (WvW) related, *only* if you own PoF.
---
It would be weird to break from that, however I suppose there’s nothing tipping them. 
---
I know, I’m trying, and I want it reaaaaaallly badly. Have you got Nevermore? Did it take you long to get?
---
That's good to know! It probably won't be often something I can make, as 8:45pm Central is absolutely prime time for me. I'll almost certainly be in raids or fractals or some other pre-planned event with guildies most days.
---
But! If I'm ever not, it's good to know! Thank you!
---
Mesmer, Guardian, Warrior &amp; Elementalist.
---
Those are absolute Meta in PvE and to some degree also cancer in PvP and WvW. You have several builds for all kinds of content and can switch a lot of roles within your class.
---
Other classes differ greatly in their viability but looking back for the last 5 years those four were allways somewhere decently placed.
---
Other classes might be good in PvP or WvW only and lack greatly, or are absolute useless in PvE (fractals and raids).
---
[hey sis](https://i.imgur.com/hC9Yrny.jpg)
---
Isn't the source code online? People would likely just continue the project.
---
Hmmm, interesting. I'll have to try this. I don't have the position rewinder so it'll probably be a touch slower, but that should still work.
---
Plus I think I can nom the Dragon Crystals, right? That's extra magic.
---
nice, I like the leystone effect with the color! 
---
the floofy feather thing looks so good on charr. I have it on one of mine too
---
I did my first tanking on VG and gorse with 1590 toughness. Armour was diviner while trinkets were minstrels which i farmed via lw3. Should be enough normally as most pugs now have options to replace their toughness
---
An 8bit crocodile raptor would be glorious. So would a beedog griffon.
---
True.
---
I don't want a LW map released in chunks over a season, but it would be fantastic if they could fill in some of the 3-4 month gaps with small additions to old maps. Like, if in-between the finale of Season 4 and the premiere of Season 5 they went back and opened up Gandara. That sort of thing happening occasionally would make me absurdly happy.
---
Maybe if you know skips and exploits. But the way they're designed, on tribune path you need to pull 3 chains at same time, and on effigy path you need to stand near 4 braziers and pull a chain at the same time.
---
Well we have all the SAB gliders and the SAB decorations in the guild halls.
---
But I do like the idea of a skin that changes with the festivals. But that might be even more unlikely since we already got skins for winter days and mad king.
---
Required is a strong word. Our guild regularly does fractals. Without a Chrono. Without a Soulbeast. In T4 fractals. I wouldn't say it's easy time, but it sure can be done. Often enough we're just 4, too and still make it through.
---
So no. That is not required. And you can still have fun. 
---
Yeah, I ran it for over 40 hours in LNY... got lots of Xbox time in as a result though (keeping my laptop next to me of course)
---
I feel like the 'banner' type idea is already covered by Kalla and Glint. We already have enough support specs.
---
Replace the banners with Norn transformations, and I might digg it.
---
For open world, I'd just have everyone play power reaper.  It self crit caps, self 25 mights, self 25 vulns, self quickness, self stability, and even alacrity isn't too bad since the best attack in shroud is autoattack until your buffed up enough that shroud 4 is better.
---
Power reaper is fine for casual fractals, and fantastic if your not bringing someone to give you might or quickness (which sometimes casual groups do).  Dungeons however are basically all centered around 10 second burst fights, which reaper is solid at.  The only change I would make for dungeons is all 3 of you would bring blood is power, use it at the start of a burst, then drop well of suffering, greatsword 4, shround-&gt;shroud 4. 
---
How much fps? What settings? Nothing can handle wvw at max chatacter model limit. 
---
Definitely have. I want Nevermore more than I want a girlfriend. 
---
I do not know if anyone else has found this bug, but i came across this while trying to take a screenshot and had to share it since i have not seen this anywhere else (:
---
Also Moto is referenced by Taimi in the Taimis Game story of season 3. So core story

Is there a visual effect here? Or just laundry listing it?
---
I would have left it at the weapon/backpack &amp; finishers only if I’d had sway over it.
---
Gliders, not seen that often.  Chairs/mounts I’d take a hard pass on, but here we are.
---
Not just mentioned, we participate in a simulation with Moto's tech and fight a SAB foe :V
---
Kessex Hills is long overdue for some tidying up.
---
THEY ARE SO CUTEEEEEEE! Please, do choyas!
---
Can't upvote this enough. It is fantastic.
---
I'm looking for a desktop that can handle WvW. 
---
Nothing can handle large scale combat without FPS drops. Just saying. 
---
If the mounts weren’t holographic but rather had things like baubles &amp; bauble bubbles hanging off of them, sure I’d take that.  But if they go full see through like the minis while being a bright color... that’d be much for my tastes.
---
Yes? Why wouldn't they?
---
Anecdotally, I did VG last night on my druid with a group of mostly training run-people. Our designated chrono tank couldn't build enough toughness to out-aggro the heal scourge, so the heal scourge ended up tanking it (successfully!)
---
It was a bit of a cluster for other reasons, namely that 7/10 of the people were on comms while 3 weren't,l. The comms people were switching between wanting to do greens and not wanting to do greens without making sure that non-comms people got the memo.
---
Once everyone got on the same page (which took a while because plans kept changing), the final, successful attempt was surprisingly smooth.
---
I'd pick up thief. It deals excellent damage in all game modes. 
---
Sell or use is always an odd question. Surely if it's worth the gold selling then it's worth opening to someone
---
I 100% agree with you here. I feel like she was the sphinx blocking the road to open communication. She may have been nice, but she was terrible as the head of communication and it feels much better with her gone. 
---
it's not forgotten, it's abandoned. they dissolved their guild team.
---
I don't like existing, so I think this adds up to the pile :p. Btw i am not 100% sure of the swing term being non-native. But i may have understood. So ty.
---
Pretty sure that all backpieces get replaced by shields, no exeptions.

This is great

Can someone tell me where this was "already posted"

And it is Super odd that it was already posted considering I made it this morning and that involed taking a low res image of scarlett and making it a higher res but you know, someone likely did the same thing and posted it but it is not on the first 7 pages of NEW or the front page.  That is fine the mods are fine on this sub...

Which major MMO has 3-4 year gaps between expansion releases?
---
The boomerang has problems at the rapids part, it doesn’t work like the whip so you can’t hit crocodiles as easily with it.
---
Would be nice to have the option since you have to use bombs at time instead, especially with trib.
---
I get that. I just don't want to get less than 30 FPS in blob fights. 
---
Exactly!  
---
&gt; This doesn't look like a usual write-off from a game developing company
---
funny because I read it as exactly that. This late in the game "more of the same" isn't good enough. We need engaging, repeatable content. Not more living world that lasts for an hour once every few months. And "QoL" updates that should have been in the game at launch aren't content.
---
The only somewhat positive thing in the post is the mention of the raid, but surprise, it's delayed.
---
Although I like the idea of Arc, having to constantly delete and download arc with every patch gets tiresome, and requires lots of web-browsing to not screw up (cuz I forget how to do it every. single. patch.). I hope they dont pull a sneaky on us and monetize it, because that would NOT be cool. Build templates is one of those QoL things that should be baseline in an MMO where your builds are expected to be changing constantly depending on the content.
---
I have 3 characters with different builds for the same 1 class just for PvP, and some more duplicates for other builds with other classes. Sure I could memorize and change things quickly between matches, but between loading screens and last minute decisions, there is a high chance that I might miss or not have time to change something! 
---
Looking forward to build templates, but not looking forward to them charging basic functionality.
---
&gt; 20+ chars
---
Now if we could get a revamped character select screen too...
---
I believe I said all but required. Really, I should say it's quickness and alacrity that are all but required, but chrono brings some extra utility with skips. 
---
I understand fractals can be done with any comp. It's not IMPOSSIBLE to do fractals without a Chrono. But, if you want to get into clearing them with consistency and reasonable speed, Chrono is the right call. I frequently only have about an hour to play. Being able to clear T4s and recs in under that hour is important to me. 
---
I CAN finish a bowl of chicken noodle soup with a fork, but I'll have a more enjoyable time if I use a spoon. Similarly, I CAN clear fractals without a Chrono, but, given the choice, why would I? I'll have a much easier and more enjoyable time with one.
---
If you don't have access to one and want to clear with friends that also don't have one, that's a different story and I can understand that. But, if you or one of your friends decided to learn it, I'd wager you'd be pleased to have it in your arsenal of options :) 
---
I cannot fathom how anyone can be unironically excited by living world in 2019. We need engaging, repeatable content. Boring content that lasts for an hour once every few months isn't going to cut it.
---
Yeah, you're right.
---
See, I like content that is engaging and utilizes the game's amazing combat system and provides great replay value. Whereas someone like you enjoys leaking recordings of legendary armor early and providing terrible raiding advice. To each their own I guess.
---
gas all charr
---
Exactly:-)
---
Can those just be held in the TP? I’d imagine you’d need a ton of accounts to hold all those stacks
---
Well it is the first.. so it makes sense they put a lot of effort into it and then realized "we can't keep doing this for all of them or we'll never get to release the game and our funding isn't gonna last a decade on GW1 alone".
---
Easiest karma you ever received :)
---
I understand what you mean and I think it could have been phrased that way. I am not native and I didn't think that "crap" was going to be felt like "exaggerated" being on the internet (reddit) and not in a kindergarten. I haven't commented on the website itself because i am not informed enough on how a website should be made properly and usually i don't mind the form but the result (ex: I don't like most underwater skills even if some of them are beautiful to watch). A friend linked it to me, i skipped everything and went to the buyng part , because even if i don't like the water part i wouldn't like to be stuck without expansion. 
---
It shouldn't be that much of a difference, depends on the cost. Single core performance is probably the most relevant one, with both being multicore already.
---
https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-8750H-vs-Intel-Core-i5-8300H/m470418vsm425634
---
Ram shouldn't affect it, but i mean, depends on what other stuff you want to run in the background. 8GB can be achieved fairly fast.
---
Looking at performance graphs i7 4770k is fairly equivalent to what you are proposing and it does poorly in GW2 (even OCed to 4.7Ghz). And r9 290 is stronger than GTX1050. I'm going as low as 10 fps with that in wvw zergs on fairly low settings.
---
I would imagine when they implement it, there will be some sort of limitation on it at the base level.  Whether that's in the number of templates you can create, or some other limitation, there will be something.  The introduction of build templates means that additional character slot purchases from the gem store will decrease significantly, as it will no longer be necessary to have a separate toon for every build (if that's how you currently do it).  They'll have to make up that lost revenue somehow!
---
The intermediates really need a bank tab,
---
Typical reddit. Random guy makes a frivolous post that literally doesn't harm anyone, and is quite entertaining to read and gets downvoted to hell.
---
Never change. &lt;3
---
What will we meme now :(
---
Or SAB holographic gloves for that matter?
---
was more of speaking to the point that SAB isn't wholly 'contained'
---
But if you want to go on about visual stuff only... Well, like I pointed out to someone else:
---
&gt;We also have giant wing back items (even giant rainbow ones), all kinds of silly weapon skins, a karka head crab helmet among many other novelty armor skins. We have a bunch silly/goofy tonics and minis. There are all kinds of high-end gag items like dance party items, costume brawls, and even legendary weapons.
---
&gt;We have giant spoopy mounts from halloween, cartoonishly cozy mounts from wintersday, and all kinds of goofy spinoff theme skins for them in general.
---
I get that the aesthetic doesn't appeal to everyone, but GW2 has no shortage of goofy visual skins and/or effects
---
They managed to put Jesus Raptor, Jesus Cow and the airship event in Arah though, and that’s the last dungeon
---
I guess different people have different expectations, but I think they are already monetizing this by requiring you to have bag space for the equipment. Build templates historically in almost every game I have played uses equipment from the inventory, not an alternative bag space (other than recently D3, but thats not an MMO however their system is not bad either). 
---
I know people are used to getting charged for everything, but I wouldnt want think Anet would be as low as charge for this feature. This is not cosmetic, this is **functional**, it actually gives an advantage to people. Think about it, if you can switch OOC, then if you can disengage for long enough in WvW (thieves have it the easiest of course) then switch gear, now you can have the upper hand on the enemy. Or what about raids, imagine if you are required to have 4 different templates total for the bosses, cuz they aint' about the waitin' life.... and I could go on. 
---
No, this is not a chargeable thing, and it should not be. Want to make money? Keep making shiny stuff, I will continue buying, like I bought the SAB chair, and im thinking of maybe getting the jetpack if I decide to make a tech character. Release armors instead of outfits, etc etc. But charging for functionality is not the way to go, it goes agaisnt their philosophy and our expectations. 
---
It sucks. I meet so many people who want to join my guild and I kind of have to throw my hands up and say, "Sorry, no officer online and they dont trust me to not abuse power." 
---
Most disheartening. Feel my heart sink everytime I ask in GC if we got an officer. I understand the reasoning, there are griefers out there, and an invite-only setting for certain ranks would do wonders for players like me (and I assume there are several others).
---
There is no point in templates if yount have atleast two o.O
---
But to all those norn with bunny ears and handlebar mustaches... your opinion is wrong!
---
I ranted and raved against the wings too.  
---
But it’s a battle against a cliff where all I can do is voice my opinion to signal to Anet that I don’t want it to get worse, because what we have isn’t going to go away.
---
The whole “well we already have &lt;something else just as bad&gt;” is just a patronizing excuse IMO.
---
Not really such a thing as a true tank in gw2. And reaper clears content fine, yeah, but every other power DPS class clears it better.
---
Agree with the comment above you. Chrono, Druid, Reaper is fine, but swap Reaper for any other power DPS class to hit even harder. 
---
Increased luck cap would be great! Or at least more sinks / recipes for these essences.
---
&gt;Source? Has u/deltaconnected said he will discontinue updating it if build templates are added?
---
..yes. We've known this from the very start: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/704oem/build_templates_actual_release/
---
&gt;This is a stopgap until a 1st party solution
---
He could only release this - and the community use it - with express permission from Anet. It is seriously not controversial to expect that, if they come up with their own monetised version of the same thing, they will withdraw their clearance for everyone to use the free version?
---
We don't know if it will be monetised or how. I am simply saying, if it is *hypothetically*, it will be a terrible decision.

---
the &lt;something just as bad&gt; is a pointless argument because when it comes to subjective taste it's not like you can do much to convince someone else to share your opinion. that's not my goal here, though i understand if you perceived it that way.
---
i'm not trying to make an excuse for adding *more* stuff that is cartoonish and whacky, i'm just trying to emphasize that the devs clearly enjoy making stuff like this on occasion and it's reasonable to expect more of it. some of it will be more egregious than others (I really can't stand the """swimsuit""" minis for example), but some of it can be done tastefully enough (like the nine tails jackal).
---
The game doesn't lose the equipment aspect at all though.
---
Lets say that I craft an ascended mace with berserker stats.
---
I can already use this item on all of my characters who can equip maces.  This just makes it easier to swap gear between characters.  That's literally all this does.
---
Here's how this would work...
---
I right click on the item, and select "Add to Armory" - the item is removed from my inventory and permanently stored in the armory.
---
Later if I want to equip it, I right-click the weapon slot on my character and select "Equip from Armory" - a screen pops up where I select my weapon type and stat combination that I've unlocked and press the OK button.
---
you won't have alacrity, but you can maintain quickness permanently, along with aegis, fury, retaliation, stability, etc. 
---
I remember when those were actually worth farming...
---
Gearing new characters DOESN'T require more gear now though.  I can swap everything over right now between characters if I want to.
---
This argument doesn't hold a lot of weight, I'm sorry.
---
If the new ingredients aren't heavily composed of garlic, I don't know what we're bothering with.  
---
Any good food has a metric shit ton of garlic.
---
You can already unlock once and use it freely.  This changes nothing in that regard.  It just makes it easier to shuffle gear around.  That's all this does.
---
The lack of content is what scares actual, long term players many of whom are paying customers away. 
---
And I seem to remember this sub being very adamant about it being entirely OK to quit the game and go play other games if you aren't super excited by openworld / living story. 
---
All things said, I'm happy they gave us a roadmap. They're at least trying to do things with the game again, which in all honesty I don't feel like they were doing since PoF or even before then. But I doubt many things will change, it's too little too late and I doubt anet's ability to turn this around. 
---
Answers the question why my LFG either takes ages to fill up or empties fast after the encounter :(
---
never. like moto says, sab is INSIDE the box, and it should stay there. the wings and copter glider skin are enough. could u imagine trying to use the bank and 8 bit flashing buzzing noises with frosty glitchy sprites at every joint of the mount searing your screen? SAB mounts would be far beyond overkill in terms of design that ruins gw2. the quaggan hats and wings are bad enough, but even they are tame by comparison
---
Was hard to see but was it the floating raptor (probably) at the end?

[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grenth%27s_Regalia_Outfit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grenth%27s_Regalia_Outfit)
---
I'd argue that for a small group like this, reaper provides great dps, maybe not top tier, but what it lacks in pure dps it makes up for with its ability to tank. I know you said there's no such thing, but I'm not sure what other single term better describes the huge health pool, shroud, and possibility of minion adds that all serve to draw aggro and absorb mob dps output.
---
I think the tradeoffs are minimal and wholly acceptable, especially for a small group that's still learning, in light of the aforementioned benefits, regardless of whether you want to call it a tank or not.
---
The other good option would be a mesmer in this role, whether a chrono with its blocks and evades, or a mirage with its dodge spam...but either one of those presents a higher gear and skill floor than reaper, plus OP says they've already got a reaper ready to go.
---
Yeah
---
Generally, I suggest picking classes that appeal to you. Don’t just pick what is popular or looks strong if you don’t enjoy it. 
---
Ah, my bad. 
---
Thanks for answering.  I guess the question behind the question is "should I pick a profession based on their elite" eg if I wanted to be Pistol/Sword duelist of a mesmer, I'd probably be best to look elsewhere?
---
How? I'd love to slowly get closer to people well in my chair.
---
The intention was that they were just another option, but in many cases they are just flat out better, the really notable exceptions being warrior and engineer. Condi engineer tends to have equal if not better output than the elite specs with condi damage, and PvE spellbreaker is really only used over core warrior for boon stripping, and not for damage
---
As for elite specs between the expansions, they're fairly equivalent, just different. Some specs are much more geared towards support rather than damage (druid vs soulbeast, chronomancer vs mirage), some are better and cleaving large amounts of trash mobs vs one high health single target (daredevil vs deadeye), etc. 
---
And some of the elite specs really only see use in some of the game modes but not all of them. Scrapper is generally only used in PvP modes, while it's very niche in PvE. 
---
Sandswept Isles had cool metas and interesting stuff with the trophy hunter achievments. Easily one of my favourite maps in the game.
---
There's plenty of meat-bags in Cantha we can use as fodder.
---
It's been said, but Revenant already has a support spec in Herald, that has power as its only real offensive build option. Renegade is arguably damage/support too (though in practice it tends to be either condi renegade which lacks on support or alacrity renegade which lacks on damage).  
---
Either way, from a PvE perspective at least, I think Revenant really needs just a dedicated power dps spec. Currently whether you go Herald or Renegade you're pretty much just locked into sword/sword, and it honestly feels pretty similar to play as Power Herald or Power Renegade.  
---
With that in mind, I do agree a power spec would need to get greatsword. It has to be a two-handed weapon (I'll get to that in a sec), longbow isn't a great option as a) we just got shortbow in the last elite spec and b) given how mediocrely sword/sword power rev performs I feel a dedicated power spec should outperform sword/sword to be worth existing, and it's hard to justify longbow outdamaging sword/sword while having the range advantage too. Rifle feels unlikely too, given the historical nature of legends making rifles a bit anachronistic.  
---
Anyway, I claimed it had to be a 2h weapon - it's got to compete favourably with sword/sword, but rev doesn't really have any other 1h power weapons, so a new 1h weapon would have to go alongside a sword. The problem with a new main hand with offhand sword is that, initial burst aside, sword 4 &amp; 5 just aren't noteworthy. They're already kind of not worth using over regular sword autos unless you're running Charged Mists and want to dump your energy before legend swapping (or you need the aoe/immobilize from shackling wave or the shadowstep from deathstrike), and with the idea that a new main hand weapon is going to outperform sword (if not, what's the point?) it seems sword offhand skills wouldn't be worth using.  
---
With sword main hand/new weapon offhand, either the new skills are going to be worse than sword offhand in which case won't be used why bother, or they'll be better, at which point unless they really break the mould with skills 4 &amp; 5 being stronger higher cooldown skills, we're going to end up with the situation where it's just 'sword auto, use new offhand skills off cooldown, that's it'. Unless the new legend/elite spec itself has some reasonable in depth mechanics to play with (and even then you're only in a given legend roughly half the time).  
---
I mean, I could be wrong. Maybe we'll get a dagger main hand with high damage high energy low cd skills and the ability to equip 3 legends with only a 5s cooldown on swap but we have to cycle in order or something, at which point sure, sword offhand to dump energy to trigger Charged Mists so you can get more dagger skills off could actually be fun to play, but by and large I think sword are a little too flawed currently to have a proper power dps spec that doesn't do away with them.
---

I wish the game was about expanding lore from GW1 instead of its last second addition of elder pinatas.
---
Thats not the point. Many posts that follow rules and are about discussion and promoting it and talking about the game get downvoted to oblivion, making them obscure and rarely allows it to engage with the community.
---
You'd probably want to go mirage then, the path of fire elite spec for mesmer. Although, on that note, I can't speak for the effectiveness of pistol/sword right now, but from what I can tell (mesmer is my least played class, so, grain of salt), it doesn't seem like a terribly amazing combination in any game mode.
---
Hey I'm just learning Ele (recently came back to the game). Could you explain your actual damage rotation or like burst setups/combos?
---
that is kind of the entire motivation for why we want to integrate aurene into the elder dragon balance, so we do not have to deal with them anymore.
---
This is literally every subreddit. And every sudreddit acts like it's the only one. I'm not sure what you'd want this subreddit in specific to do, or if there is any need for anyone to do anything. The numbers only exist in comparison to each other. If everyone of those were sitting at 10 they'd still all be equally 'buried' among  each other. Which is to say, not buried at all, as we can see all of them have discussion going on in them.
---
I was looking into AHK just the other day, but even with a macro jump-dodging seemed less consistent than what I'm able to do on my own. Tried a bunch of stuff with different ordering of the sends and with sleeps inbetween and whatnot, but to no avail.

Are macros working flawlessly for everyone else?

Point is that a 0 vote or negative post eventually disapears from the page thus reducing the amount of possible discussion. Not to mention that the purpose of downvotes is to downvote posts that DO NOT follow rules and arent promoting discussion about the topic which is this game.

there is a dedicated individual or bot which automatically downvotes almost every new post, but yes in general this sub can be quick with downvotes if you make a meta post, blog post, or low quality shitpost in general. a post like this one, for example.

In all fairness if you are attempting Trib mode you should have the dodge-jump nailed perfectly WITHOUT a macro. I have not played the game in two years and I logged in last night for shiggles. I could still do the dodge-jump perfectly without fail. I am not trying to gatekeep here, I am just saying it is a good skill to have and you don't need a macro crutch to perfect it.
---
Druid would like to say hello.
---
You can still get charms/symbols from salvaging unidentified gear. It seems to take upgrades into account since you also get lucent motes.
---
It also helps having skills like shroud 4 that are like dps blob skills, it is hard to not hit everything haha. Compare that to things like ranger gs2 which hit one direction and one time so it is easy to mess up, even if the class does have a WHOLE 15% higher benchmark (lol.)
---
Dude. Thats war. Thats how it functions. You cant fight something without loss and if you dont fight the loss is even more substantial.

No one ever truely wins a war.
---
Hodgin hidden dialogue was supposed to be part of path1 before they scrapped it for being too long of a path. You’re talking about in the necro room when you merge paths right?
---
\^\^ The game used to be so god damn good... before raids, outfits, and BLC cosmetics.
---
So we can ignore the fact that this game is called Guild Wars 2? That explains why we are now fighting Ben 10s ultimate form fused with Goku in Middle Earth. Yeah, nothing about Tyria is being expanded upon. Yup. None at all. 
---
Until EotN (which was made as preparation for the sequel) elder dragons weren't present in the game AT ALL.
---
My bold theory?
---
We, the Commander are now a Demigod.
---
We were there when Aurene died and we absorbed not only her but also all the magic she had consumed from Balthazar and Joko, which is why we survived the blast. Any other *normal* person would have died.
---
We're going to realize that the only way to stop the Elder Dragons is not to kill them, but to absorb their magic until they fall into a slumber again.
---
But to keep a different appearance for each character, you need different gear for each of them.
---
I completely agree that we should not need to get a complete set of ascedned gear with a stat we already got before, but each character should need to have their own gear.
---
For example, if we could unlock 'berserker' stat for ascended swords by salvaging a berserker ascended sword, then all of your characters who have an ascended sword would be able to switch it to berserker, but first you'd need to get that berserker sword and destroy in the process of unlocking. Then each other character would have to get their their own ascended sword to switch, if you don't want to constantly move swords between characters in he bank.
---
A simple method to unlock stats would be by salvaging gear. The stat would be unlocked up to the maximum value you've salvaged so far. So if you salvaged a level 80 exotic sword at most, that'll be the max you'd be able to apply on level 80 gear. 
---
That, along a cost to switch for non-legendary gear, guarantees people will keep obtaining and removing items from the economy as they unlock more stats and higher stats up to the ascended max.

Holds very well to this day in wvw. Not amazing but graphs on low/medium and it runs pretty well. Anything better than that will be ok
---
People down vote on this sub just because they can. Posting a funny clip from wvw is enough to get down voted to 0
---
So they did with elder dragon's exactly the same what they did with Abaddon arc, which we agreed on being bad.
---
Nah, enough non-shiny stuff is being introduced too. People just like the shiny stuff more, as evident in GW1 where most people went for the shiny items too.
---
And it’s player base seems to not enjoy having conversations anymore and allows for them to continue 
---
Wont happen. Cant happen. Kormir only managed it because she was blessed by the gods. She was given the power to withstand it. Our player character hasnt undergone any changes to allow it. Just look at what happened the last time the Commander got too much magic in them.
---
They nearly went insane! Started to hallucinate anomalies and scream in pain.
---
I never said it was a bad thing, I just stated that it happened in GW1 too.
---
The downvote button lets ignorant twats feel like their input matters, that's all its for 
---
But your OP is not a conversation. It's a monologue of multiple statements and a goodbye at the end. What response did you expect?
---
Yeah I am among the many who secretly hope they remove the mounts or do something spectacular to balance them because the current implementation is super lacking in my opinion.
---
Then by your logic the entire GW 1 arc is concluded, so they wouldnt expand on it.
---
Youre not doing yourself much of a favor here.
---
This needed to be changed since day one! Splitting off invite permission is not only a solution for trusting vs accessibility. But it opens up the possibility of "community guilds" that are formed to connect players with similar interest. Such as, raiding, jump puzzle help,wvw support, and much more.
---
And since it's concluded arc, it obviously can't be expanded on.
---
So I just bought both expansions on the sale they had last week, I haven't played the game since I got a lvl 20 when the base game first dropped. Pretty overwhelmed, any suggestions? Should I burn a lvl 80 token or wait to get a better feel for game/characters?
---
What many peeps don't understand is that these skins are not cut from the game to sell them in the gemstore. Many of these skins would simply not exist if they were not designed for the gemstore specifically. Sure it would be great to have such things more via ingame rewards, but reality looks different.
---
Gw1 has a limited things to buy.. so just naturally everything was less over the top. 
---
Gw2 you have chairs, shoulders, armor, mounts, accessories, weapons, 
---
Everything you own can be shiny 
---
Oh yeah, we have build wars now? Sweet, I can't wait to swap out some of my greatsword skills. Oh wait, half my bar is still tied to the weapon I'm using?
---
It's absolutely great (although late) that we're getting build templates, but this game is still very far away from being "build wars" in the same way the first was.
---
Personally I identify and salvage and hoard the materials for future use.
---
If you're gonna salvage it is still worth identifying for that tiny chance of getting  a rate or even exotic (tho I have yet to get a single exotic since the change...)
---
Pistol isn't that great of a weapon on mesmer. It's mostly used in condi mirage build in pve and some meme builds in pvp modes, but even then it's not a very competitive pick. 
---
In term of solo play in pve you can play whatever you like and elite spec shouldn't affect you much unless you like it's mechanics.
---
Just a simple question. What is considered an Ally? When I have an ability the buffs or heals an Ally, is that someone specifically in my party, or is that just any non hostile near me?
---
Thats just how games are now. Its not a problem inherently with gw 2. Its a problem with people. It sells or else no one would buy it or use it, etc.
---
YOU dont have to look like a walking chandelier. I sure dont.

Its like if youre not bandwagoning then theres no point to this sub.
---
Idk ff14 does a good job of limiting this.
---
Even elder scrolls isn’t as bad because they at least try to be lore friendly 
---
It's not my logic. It's Anet. Abaddon's arc is concluded by his death. It's finished, entirely. And while we can discuss if there was anything to expand on in factions or nightfall, prophecies campaign had open ending.
---
Pls uninstall. Thx
---
Imo glossy black is really great to use instead of abyss or shadowabyss etc.
---
You didn't ask for anyones opinion in your OP, you stated what you believe in. So okay, you shared with us, bye bye.
---
A conversation is started by making a question. If you just make it a statement people will most likely take it as that. A statement that requires no input. Youre stating it as fact meaning youre not open to a counter argument.
---
I feel like there's a lot of hand-waving going on in MMOs when it comes to armies and the like. I do question the Pact's numbers for sure, but I also recognize ArenaNet made an effort throughout the story to point out that we've also recruited forces outside the Pact. In HoT, we got native forces like the Itzel and Nuhoch. In PoF and LWS4, we got some like the various groups of Elonians and the Olmakhan. I also imagine the Pact had to put more effort into recruiting more people into their ranks after their losses.
---
And do we know that Kralkatorrik wiped out the army we built up for episode 5? I'm sure there were casualties, but it sounded like he merely went away at the end rather than obliterating many of our allies.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if ArenaNet glosses over those details and moves the story along anyhow. It doesn't bother me much in the end as what has happened still feels plausible enough, but I do appreciate when extra effort is made to flesh it all out.
---
Not all conversation start with a questions. Sometimes they start out by stating opinions. So no that’s incorrect 
---
Just like your mothers jewelery or your dads new car (if he got one, bear with the analogy here).

I’m stating a sad turn for a game I loved. But I guess the player base can’t see the importance of that 
---
It is common mistake on the internet that people overestimate the weight of their opinions.
---
You hit the nail on the head. Ignore the cunts in this thread, they have no way to impact their real lives and this sub lets them feel like the have some control
---
you seem pretty stupid tbh.  bye felicia.
---
It’s also common for people to be assholes but whatever
---
This so much resembles a toxic relationship; they keep promising you the same things, over and over. They threat you badly and thus any semblance of commitment towards you makes you think they're crazy about you. They promise the same thing, over and over again, with the same results.
---
&gt; The visual clutter is over the top in my opinion
---
No argument there but thats not the point.
---
As for the raptor, a different breed. Much like dogs.
---
The dragon wings are much like the real world equivilant of cosplay props. Only difference the real world is boring and magic isnt a thing.
---
The bee infusion aura is what happens when you steal a queen bee. You get chased by a swarm. Logic. And again, thats one of those things that you HAVE TO SUSPEND YOUR DISBELIEF. Auras arent there to satisfy your lore. Theyre there to satisfy the skritt mind that is humans. We love to show off, sometimes to a fault.
---
Its ways that the game lets us say ¨HEY, I DID that¨
---
I got the dell inspiron 7567 and it runs wvw at solid frame rates with some fps dips during some fights, but overall this laptop is great
---
That's how attention seekers start a conversation.

---
I'm gonna leave an offies here.
---
I mostly say this sub due to my experiences with other subs.
---
I'll take his provisioner tokens.
---
Being Chosen doesnt mean you can absorb insane amounts of magic. Two different things.
---
DPS Chronomancer has a pretty simple rotation. Just spam your phantasms and you'll generally be fine.
---
you're stupid = bullying? Come on...
---
Obviously. Point is Anet can state anything in the game with no explanation, just like commander becoming chosen out of nowhere.
---
Can I have your items ? I mean you are leaving aren't you?
---
Btw game is ok stop complaining or wishing for gw3. Half gamers won't switch to the new one.
---
Comments like this are just as bad.
---
It's just this subreddit. The people here are the exact players you're complaining about. They jerk off to the tumblr-quality writing of the LS and shoot their load all over their own faces every time a new gem store skin in released. This subreddit is dogshit for any actual discussion about the game.
---
Too many shiny characters and chairs is what's bothering you.  Ok.  I'm sure there are plenty of games out there without shiny characters and chairs.  Give them a try.
---
Oh yeah, I forgot FFXIV has an even better system. 
---
&gt; It's not my logic. It's Anet. Abaddon's arc is concluded by his death. It's finished, entirely.
---
And yet in GW 2 weve touched upon Abaddon a few times. Once with his statue in Season 2 coupled with an easter egg if you dance infront of it.
---
And again in Season 3 Episode 5.
---
Just because something ended doesnt mean it cant be expanded on.
---
Prophecies didnt end on a cliffhanger or an open ending. It ended. The prophecy was fulfilled. The Titans went extinct and the Mursaat lost.
---
Which brings us back full circle. The Mursaat and White Mantles story was continued in GW 2 and given a full conclussion.
---
What you WANT is happening in GW 2. The problem isnt whats being done. Its that YOU want what YOU want and if you dont get what you want then its inherently bad.
---
I am not obliged to like anything anet does. And I am free to voice my disgust.
---
can you link me the build e the rotation? 
---
Except no one actually did anything but buy it of the gem store or the trading post.
---
If you actually had to work to get these things they would be less abundant and wouldn’t be as irritating 
---
And? That doesnt excuse it and only proves my point further. Youre escalating it.
---
[Three words for ya](https://i.imgur.com/srsHwTU.gif)
---
Yeah calling someone stupid when they didn’t attack you in anyway is bullying 
---
A whole lot harder and really an exercise of 'take forever to finish', but yeah, definitely.
---
The real question is where you want to play it. At this point 99% of the responses you're going to get only consider top-end fractals, raids, and competitive modes. If you want to run world bosses or T2 fractals, you can get by with almost anything as long as you know how to play the game.

You speak as if the baseline raptor is much more believable or realistic. Or any of the other mounts for that matter. 
---
But yes, I do agree. 
---
Nah I’m pretty sure you are escalating it
---
done

look at the amount of PR editing on every single wording to make less content try to look like a lot. horrible sign for the future. exactly what EA does, pass off QoL updates as if they worked on a whole expansion. they have no more resources for an expansion. large updates is what keeps new players coming and old players returning. Cooking 500, legendary runes, tournament support for PvP isn't gonna do any of those. These are updates that aren't supposed to be glorified as if they're main parts of a ROADMAP. Living World is literally 2 to 3 days of content. I've seen this kind of mass PR edited wording bs. They do it when they try to hide lack of resources or upcoming content. 4 teams to work on nothing anyone would prefer over an expansion. 
---
Don't know what makes you happy, but being a raider, legendary runes and Build Templates should be enough of a bomb. It surely wet my pants. I'm gonna start stacking up gold so that when it does release, I will be able to immediately start it. 
---
Only thing fishy here is the release. When will all of this be released? This year, or the next? Hope it doesn't take long. 
---
Uninstall reddit. So I should ddos it?
---
There was one "easily" accessible before the mount era in Caledon Forest. On the west side of the map, a tad lower than TA dungeon, there's a house in a small town which you could climb onto and then leap into a hole which would lead, if you didnt die from fall damage, to a JP. Lavaish floor and vines. Two main paths, one lead to a branch door, the other to an asuran platform with water down below with a hole that allowed you to break out the map. I loved going down there, it had a nice ambience :3
---
I know it is a dream but please let it become true that the build templates system we have been waiting for will be better than even FFXIV's 
---
Not everything requires an explination. Commander being chose was a nod to Prophecies. Its called an easter egg.
---
It wasnt even relevant to the actual plot. That part of the game was a conclusion to an arc. A call back and a conclusion to a story thread that was left open YEARS ago.
---
No one eats bacon for the health benefits.  Bacon is fucking delicious.
---
&gt;Power Chronomancer has a high learning curve and is primarily recommended for people who enjoyed playing Condition Engineer in the past. This is because the rotation is fast paced and not easily learnt by beginners.
---
Necromancer should be fine. Both power reaper and condi scourge have a decent amount of aoe damage and the fact that you can play both power and condi makes the class versatile. Condi scourge even has some support in the form of barrier and condi cleanse and can take optional utility in epidemic or spectal grasp (if cc/pulls are really neccessary). Power reaper also has one free utility alot assuming you can manage your life force correctly which lets you take utilities like specral grasp or even signet of undeath if your group is stuggling with staying alive.
---
You can even play support scourge which is playable and pretty good on some bosses as a secondary healer. Since most pugs play with 2 healers you can bring 1 druid for spirits, spotter and goe, adding a support scourge can alleviate some pressure on certain bosses while not messing with the ca generation of druid too much as your main way of mitigating damage is barrier and not direct healing. The carry power of this build is insane if your group is bad.
---
Also, anyone that doesn't want necros in their squad is genuinely not up-to-date with what's going on. Both condi scourge and power reaper are viable dps options. It is true that on condi encounters a good mirage will outdps you no matter what and the benchmark for power reaper is not as high as other power classes. This doesn't make it bad though. You bring solid cc and insane cleave on power reaper and your dmg isn't even that bad to begin with. It's only at the top level when you realize that reaper is not best in slot anywhere but so is power holosmith and people are playing it.

Figure of Speech - a word or phrase used in a non-literal sense for rhetorical or vivid effect.  It can be a metaphor or simile, designed to make a comparison. It can be the repetition of alliteration or the exaggeration of hyperbole to provide a dramatic effect.
---
You werent being rhetorical. Or doing any of that. 
---
But w/e. You can never be wrong.
---
&gt; The gemstore is for cosmetic and convenience items. Don't "template slots" fit the latter perfectly?
---
Sure, if a manner of saving builds to be applied on the fly, which has been standard for games that allow on the fly build changes for a long time, is suddenly considered convenience over superior user experience.  
---
Any game that doesn't have build save slots is one of two things: A game that requires you to visit an NPC to change your build (Aion, TERA, older WoW, Everquest (IIRC, anyway), older GW2, the list goes on) or has some arbitrary cost associated with it (newer WoW, old GW2 using reset tomes).
---
Basically you're saying it's okay for a game to cut out better user experience, which should always be a priority, in exchange for yet another real money (or significant gold which is still money since the gem market is a thing) cost. There's no reason to make it cost gems at all. For any reason. Any possible restriction is long gone, so it would be "because we can."  
---
while i've owned shadow abyss dye for a while, i recently got tar dye and now i prefer it. tar still allows you to have black, but allows lighting effects and gives texture to clothes.
---
I was literally using the world literally in a non literal sense 
---
I mean common fam.
---
Like i literally don’t see how you don’t see what’s literally right in front of you. 
---
Now I’m escalating it because you are being ridiculous 
---
The game started bleeding out before this but I quit on the patch they removed Void jumping because it was so fun breaking out of maps. You could even get to the Arena Northeast in Rata Sum.
---
Bye fam 
---
&gt; Honestly I can’t think of a thing you can earn that’s not tied to a shiny gym store version
---
98% of my armor and weapons. Even my one legendary, Aurora, isnt tied to the gem store. My gathering tools are not even shiny, they have effects sure but theyre not even screen clutter.
---
I dont even use backpacks! My glider is used only in specific situations, not cluttering up anyone.
---
The only things that can really get up in your face are chairs, which only one of them is over the top shiny, and skills.
---
Infusions and auras are exclusive to super rare drops you cant even buy on the gem store.
---
You mean the small corner in Rata Sum where it already is?
---
Such a redundant comment lol
---
The thing is, you can skip most of it and still generally do a decent amount of damage.
---
9 am sharp son
---
I will be there!
---
Yep. Also almost every story instance could be broken in. Inquiet lab in Kleenex Hills, order of whisper chalet in lornar or one of those snow maps, etc etc. It was really fun. Althouh void jumping is ded, its still possible to break out of mapa with the mounts. It offers quite a nice arrsy of options tbh.
---
it's not too different from your own OP tbh. only that you question an entire game and its players, while jaber merely questions your opinion on that. so by your own logic, you are a bully yourself. have a nice day.
---
&gt; but the only other people we've seen do that are Joko and the gods.
---
Same thing happened to the GW 1 hero. THey died and were brought back to life by an imense power.
---
That didnt change them at all.
---
As for the self resurection, well that only happened because of a monster that exploded into life energy. I think? Thats how I understood it. Not like the Commander pulled it off by tapping into some unseen potential within them.
---
I will have my calendar cleared up!
---
I agree. This could be split into 3 different permissions as inviting, promote/demote, and kicking. 
---
You can buy most infusions on the trading post for real world money. Which let’s be honest is what most people are doing 
---
The point isn’t that you can also chose to not use a shiny thing 
---
My point is that because in every item slot of things you can own there is opportunity to load on the shiny. 
---
They should have chosen a few things that could have the options to be shiny and made those things hard to get.
---
&gt; My immediate impression is that the story line is now targeted at the type of gamer that get's off on the type of plot that essentially says 'Oh wow, you're the best, you're so awesome, you're my hero'. Gone is any kind of subtlety. 
---
There aren't very many people willing to buy a game where you start up, your character dies, The End. Even the people willing to buy that won't buy those more than once or twice.
---
Most videogame characters survive through too much bullshit.
---
Yeah, there's billions of holes in Dragonstand's roof to fly the griffon out of too... it's just not the same as void jumping though. 
---
No not it’s people sitting in the reach or flying around on their glider. It’s everywhere 
---
Probably just WoW.
---
Yeahh. Plus my mad skills with the port rifles are pretty much useless now x)
---
I never called anyone out of their name or attacked anyone
---
I simply am making notice and expressing my opinion about the direction of the game. If you don’t understand the difference between the two you are actively engaging in cognitive dissonance 
---
I think this game is more enjoyable pretending backpacks and shoulderpads don't exist.
---
I have exotic berserker gear with Eagle runes, also some trinkets (although still lacking) including 2 ascended zerker rings but it's by no means fully geared up.
---
I did some 9-10k with all the boons you can select when setting up the golem (but isn't that cheating?)  
---
Haven't bothered with food cause I'm not really doing the "hardcore" content yet
---
You're right. They're not that far behind, and they're less reliant on other people.
---
But when you're in raids/high end fractals, you should expect well over 80% boon uptime.
---
And then, as you stated, they *are* behind others. So it's just not a *great* pick. It's an acceptable pick. It's fine. If a Reaper can pull off anywhere near their benchmark you won't see me complain about it unless it's CMs or we just keep missing something like Gorse 66%/33%/0%.
---
I'm not hating on Reaper. But the reality is they're not as good as any other Power DPS class.
---
You say “turn” like you believe this is sudden.  The game was gaudy from the get-go with dreamer, bifrost, and moot (just as some examples.
---
The first Halloween they introduced the greatsaw greatsword skin that everyone was running around swinging which made the sound effect pervade every corner of the game.
---
You claim this to be a new issue, but it’s been around since the launch of GW2.  It’s not a diversion, it’s been on this path for a long ass time.
---
Did everybody not clean out their stockpiles during Lunar New Year with Drooburt? 
---
There’s a sub for that? Didn’t even know...
---
Yeah both those were legendaries and hard to get and only a few of them. 
---
Legendaries can be gaudy because it’s not easy to get.
---
Oooof I hated that chainsaw omg 
---
I liked the before. The after and realistic are so boring. 
---
Only people who browse /new are reading this TBH.  It’s not the whole clientele.
---
Now come back in 30 minutes and make a 3rd thread about how you improved it a tiny bit somewhere and won the fashion wars.
---
Sure hope not 
---
Still bugged. The 200 token items like "Offering of X" are now useless.
---
I’m using Ruin :) Tried to use charred, since it’s more saturated, but decided against it because it had some weird discoloration on certain armor parts. 
---
They’re not. There’s no dungeon which has two unavailable recipes, so there’s still a use for every offering.
---
yes
---
To me it better not be monetized I'll be upset because I spent a lot of money on the game over the last 6 years and they spent the last 3 doing side projects with dwindling things for the player base, while putting items behind loot boxes.
---
It's absolutely, in my mind, deserving that we should get good content given how they wasted our money on things that failed, when my money was to promote the game and the content.  
---
They fired people because they didn't use the revenue they had well, and they need to earn my trust again as a customer
---
Gem store skins aren’t shiny. They are boring. 
---
Someone asked me to upload an update, and I did exactly that, I also took down the original post. Don’t like it, downvote, block me, and leave. 
---
yeah kinda sad they dont touch things like dungeons at all, even for the easy and small things with doesn't take much work.
---
Reminds me that i still have 2-3 old items which had mf stat originally where you can now choose the stat from 
---
So I guess spoilers are allowed on this post, especially after five days.
---
Nobody will likely see this but OP.
---
Aurene ate Joko and absorbed his powers. She will undoubtedly resurrect at a super-duper dramatic moment. oooh aaah its amazing.
---
They wouldn't ever be brave enough to kill her for good.
---
does anyone rly want to watch core tourny?
---
no class stacking is a stupid rule and thanks to that you will get like 50% less praticipation
---
They look like human Jesus but just a little different
---
To add to this, casuals may not be interested in playing hc content but they still may enjoy watching it. Tpot's raid tournaments made more audience than any anet official stream after pvp world championship.
---
But at what cost? So many lives lost.
---
Retroactively upset; why wouldn't Herald have a warhorn? That's what heralds do! 
---
And 2 silvers (:
---
Core classes are easier for people watching streams since they have significantly less clutter so I can see interest from that vantage point.
---
It’s also less stale than current meta because it’s entirely different than running in the daily tournaments.
---
Thank you! I hope you find enjoyment in gw1 and it makes you happy. The game has already died to me and has become something else entirely. Enjoy 
---
It's been getting worse as reddit has become increasingly more mainstream, I agree. I also agree hivemind in part is natural to reddit. 
---
But the extent to which content and discussion is actively filtered on this subreddit is extreme. Most discussions you'll see whoever the hivemind doesn't agree with downvoted into negatives. I can name plenty of subs where discussions between people with a different point of view will both be upvoted at different levels. 
---
I can name plenty of subs with vastly more content diversity, including gaming subs. 
---
In that regard this sub reminds me of the huge meme subs. Advice animals. Pics. woahdude. They wanna look at stuff, feel gud and upvote or downvote and literally nothing more. Which obviously is a huge part of reddit - but this isn't a sub for low effort memes. It's a sub for a videogame. 
---
Casual content already represents the vast, vast majority of content in the game. The only hardcore content in PvE we have is CM Fractals and raids. You could also very well state that hardcore players are grossly being underrepresented, with a single raid wing a year and nothing else basically.
---
The game is catered to both casual players and hardcore players. Just because you think it should only cater to casuals does not make the opinions of hardcore players any less valid, especially since they already are much, MUCH less represented than casuals.
---
Makes me kinda sad...
---
The only exit is death's embrace
---
No new race... Well, guess I'll keep playing ESO then.
---
Is there a chest at the end? If there's no chest or achievement, to me, its not a JP
---
I think you did a good job toning down the contrast on the middle one.
---
Not sure why you decided to change the coat though.
---
Okay, what reason is that?
---
Look at the price of 75% of them, they're all sub 90g. Have you done the math on what 8k rare unids costs currently?
---
Because I feel like my disdain for something is with sharing 
---
What is that?
---
Cursor replacement so as to not lose it. 
---
Your post isn't really about having a conversation. 
---
It's about throwing a tantrum and making sure your parents see how upset you are that you didn't get what you want.
---
just because you were more elaborate and eloquent about it, doesn't mean you did something different, bar the offensive term maybe.
---
and let's not kid ourselves, you might be expressing your opinion, in a decently phrased manner no doubt, but ultimately you judge the game and the community quite harshly in your post, and you base your negative verdict on a tiny excerpt, a snapshot of the actual state of everything surrounding the game. you question the direction of the game, you question its aesthetics, you question its player's tastes.
---
to top it off, you victimize yourself when it comes to even [quite neutral replies](https://dd.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b91fkx/so_sad_to_see_the_game_in_its_current_state/ek1hbot/), drawing away from the discussion you claim to want.
---
/u/jaberdeen8 's reply might be offensive, but ultimately it is just their opinion, based on limited data, to which they are entitled. and at that level his reply isn't too different to your own post, whether you want it or not.
---
now of course you are free to feel offended by their subjective judgement of you and your post. alas, that doesn't make it bullying quite yet. just like informing the entire community and game studio that you highly dislike their taste and direction, and that they lack any form of self-worth.
---
Mounts are incredibly detailed, can’t just have some blocky mount
---
You clearly don’t know what a tantrum is. Above I stated my opinions and not In a highly mean way. I stated my unhappiness. That is not having a tantrum 
---
Nice jackal statue!
---
You're sort of right in that Anet likely removed the recipes with the magic find update, but crafting the trinkets with recipes obtained before said update does craft the tradeable dire version. 
---
In other words, the recipes were updated, or at least the unlocked ones were.
---
Oh how bizarre, cos if you link the recipes, it gives the ‘cannot link from this location’ error. Thanks for the info /^^
---
Giving criticism for something you care about is definitely not the same as bullying devs and a community. 
---
Yeah, weren't WvW alliances announced like a year ago?
---
Remember when they announced Gen 2 legendaries? The precursor scavenger hunt? Multiple raid wings a year?
---
We just need to make the people ourselves.
---
Copy Mordremoth's spawning pods, scarlet's holograms and golem replicators, make countless copies of pact soldiers and golems, boom. Instant army out of a bunch of people. 
---
i never thought staring into the eyes of death was this cute
---
&gt; That said, the drop rate could probably stand to be tweaked a bit.
---
they just nerfed it last week.
---
Did you watch the video or are you being serious
---
I mean, Qadim also lost the power of his lamp, didn't he? 
---
Firebrand for defensive boons, utility and heals. Scourge for barriers, revives and conditions.
---
Tempest, renegade and herald can (to certain degree) provide all of those.
---
Only changed the coat in the third, realistic ver., since you don’t see a lot of Charr around the Citadel walking around with blue sparkles (that leystone armor normally gives you) coming out of their ass. :P
---
The new playable race is looking great
---
pot, meet kettle.
---
If making you realize your stupidity and uselessness is being a dick, then I am...thanks.
---
Ask yourself the following: if an individual is never made to realize what they're doing is making them appear stupid, do they ever stop and learn so they prevent making a mockery of themselves?
---
You're welcome! I do the job for you. It's a thankless job, but someone's gotta do it, while you live in your rainbows, sunshine, and unicorn land full of excuses and ignorance.
---
Why the  interest in recipes for exotics when ascended are so easily obtainable? 
---
For completion’s sake and also it’s incredibly frustrating that they exist and we can’t get them
---
Great video, always looking forward to WP videos. 
---
I dont agree that build templates should be monetized, specially since we already have to pay for inventory and bank space. Maybe im just "old school" but functionality should not be charged, only cosmetics. It would go agaisnt what Anet has stood for during the past few years, and would also mean that arc would become a form of piracy and thus possibly banned. 
---
I'm looking forward to see the system, but I hope Anet doesnt screw this one up, the community has understandable expectations about this feature that tbh should be baseline in almost any MMO with changeable builds, heck, even games outside of MMOs (like Diablo 3, or LoL with new runes) have gone away from charging for them (remember buying rune pages in LoL?). 
---
Paying for another chair, or gathering tool? Sure. Charging for a much needed functionality that should already be built in? No.
---
Warhorn &amp; torch are woefully underutilized. 
---
Dude's a month old account and spends most of his time badmouthing everything. I get a bit of a familiar vibe from him.
---
You can still get there by flying over the Tengu wall and swimming under the map. 
---
&gt; The average player wasn't hitting half the dps of the average player
---
I get what you mean, but that doesn't quite add up.
---
I found a hole in Wayfarer foothills that allows you to get into all the mountains around the map and fly over to the Spirit statues at Hoelbrak gate
---
I’m turning into golem from LotR holding onto this two year old precursor ring.
---
The options are salvage directly, identify and then salvage, identify and then sell, or sell directly.
---
Before the change, due to my low magic find, it was an easy decision to sell the unidentified gear directly. Now, the value on the TP should be a lot closer to the value of opening and salvaging on any character.
---
Someone tested salvaging directly versus salvaging after identifying, and their conclusion was identifying first before salvaging is better profit based on then-current prices.
---
However, that still doesn't inform our decision on selling directly versus identifying. For blues, they made about 14-15g off of identifying and salvaging 1k gear. Selling directly should net around the same unless someone is overpaying to buy the gear or in the opposite case, demand drops and the buy orders are too few and too cheap.
---
It'll take me ages to empty all those bank tabs, and i'll destroy my mouse clicking before that.
---
If it had been a vendor with a consumable you open to count for the achievement, then I could consume all of my luck in less than half an aeon.
---
yes thats what you said the first time. I just told you that if you only care about the luck and not the other value, you can salvage it directly without identifying first because it yields the same amount of luck.
---
You eat the bacon, I'll get the ham. 
---
Everyone happy.
---
We got a bazillion updates since release that saved storage space. I don't think that they use have "selling storage" in mind weighting against any QoL.
---
Deltaconnected said he's discontinuing arc build templates once anet releases their solution, so let's hope the anet version doesn't suck
---
what? no! Q A D I M
---
I think there's two types of Trib-ers. There are those that want to beat it for the rewards or for fun's sake and those that want to get extremely good at pushing faster and faster times. I am speaking to the latter. Anyone worth their weight in jumps that wants to push harder SHOULD get the dodge-jump down. I was not very clear about that.
---
&gt; What Anet's stance will be on 3rd party build templates post-implementation
---
That's easy, if they go with the monetized route they'll ban all free options.
---
I don't mean the sharing/swapping that's broken, but the "convenience" of not having to transfer the items between characters;
---
And what happens when you have racially-bound skins.
---
I commented about the audience was referring to on another post. I am just speaking to those that love jumping puzzles for the challenge and want to get extremely good at running them. It is like animation cancelling in Super Smash Melee; you don't need to know how to do it to play or beat the game but you can't be "pro" until you know how.
---
Yeah, they didn't exactly make it easy.  I imagine some people probably resorted to macros.
---
Fair point, and I'd be one of the first persons to complain if it was overpriced too.
---
OP asked for perfect trio, so I don't see any reason to bring a reaper. Reaper is absolutely crazy for sure in soloplaying, having a huge healthpool, toughness with minions, self-quickness, easy might etc. But why do you need those for a 3-man comp? If they bring a chrono, self-quickness is irrelevant, if they bring druid the might and sustain are covered. Power reaper is a very selfish build and doesn't bring much to the table. Its potential lies in solo play, not in groups. Bringing any other dps build would do better than power reaper in that 3man comp. 
---
Lol, I recently logged back in to. I opened my 3rd birthday presents and spent the rest of my time wondering why mistlock sanctuary was still super laggy even after upgrading my GPU. (R9 285 to 1060)
---
I suppose you are correct
---
&gt;  I get a bit of a familiar vibe from him.
---
How so?
---
Nerds. &lt;3 Good luck everyone.
---
Whether Ascended cooking uses bloodstone dust or not it's going to be hilarious. If it does, then the sheer, pure vindication that Seimur receives will be amazing. If it doesn't though, that's just funnier. The boundaries of the magical culinary arts are pushed back and it turns out that, nope, Seimur was always trying to cook with the magical equivalent of uranium dust and he really shouldn't do that.
---
I just came back myself, and that's exactly what I did. Spent a week on a new character (moving some things like bags and harvesting tools over for convenience) and getting back up to 80 and running some dungeons, then swapped back over to my main character today to run the level 80 content, expansions, etc.
---
Definitely worthwhile for re-learning the game, and it gives you a chance to play with your friend on his first character, if that's something you want to do.
---
DO tell me whats wrong with praising the game? Not to mention that this sub mostly upvotes the trash talking posts every time something goes wrong.
---
Oh so you mean its not a game of whack a mole?
---
I'd have drawn it at world one
---
Remember our house troll? Feels to me like that's him but trying to be legit for once.
---
Thats not a simptom of the problem. Thats a relic of an old game whos old engine is hard to update due to various problems that stem from what is essentially an engine from 2006.
---
It is exactly because it offers no offensive boons that people don't take it, the healing is great for sure, but you never really need such an excessive amount of it.
---
&gt; Geese people
---
I think they prefer to be called Tengu.
---
My cabbages!
---
I honestly hope Anet devotes developer time towards anything BUT this.
---
**Call me mean if you want, but I as a player do not want this content in Guild Wars 2.**
---
An underwater xpac would only be enjoyable for a very small minority of the population, as it's nearly unanimously agreed that underwater combat is a clunky mess in NEARLY EVERY VIDEO GAME, let alone Guild Wars 2.. Some "revamp" isn't going to change that.
---
This is the definition of "waste of dev time", especially when we know Anet is now short staffed due to their layoffs.
---
If there's zero discussion, what's the point of blindly praising the game? 
---
If this is acceptable, then blindly trashing the game should be acceptable too?
---
Hmmm, house troll.... rude asura? I mean this sub has like 5 trolls for every 2 serious posters.
---
No shit sherlock, damn did you discover that yesterday? Paying by any means, not just cash.. Think first then open your mouth
---
The option already exists in PVP to turn enemies into Basic Models. All they need to do is turn that on for everywhere else.
---
I would skip the healer entirely tbh. I'd bring power quickbrand to cover quickness while doing respectable dps and bringing some might and big fury if needed (and don't forget then pulls). Even though you're not a healer, you can help your group to sustain with f2 and f3.
---
Next would be power alacrigade for alacrity, rest of the might, kalla's fervor, assassin's presence, respectable dps and some group sustain. 
---
Third would be a more pure dps build. You could bring core power warrior for big cc, banners, empower allies and respectable dps too, but I'd probably skip that. Both quickbrand and alacrigade have cc already, and bringing something like a soulbeast would do better imo. With soulbeast you can do great dps while bringing frost spirit to up that dps. You can also debate which would be more useful, the stance-share trait or the self-dps trait. Soulbeast can also bring smokescale for a smoke field if you need to stealth skip something. 
---
Conclusion: you cover a ton of boons, have a good cc and good dps with this 3man comp. You also have lots of utility. It lacks sustain because it doesn't have a dedicated healer, but your firebrand's f2 and f3 and renegade's kalla heal and elite combined with the knowledge of the enemy mechanics should do the job. This comp would be far more fun compared to chrono-druid-dps too in my opinion (and more efficient when played well).
---
Tinker with what stats and traits you need to pick. Bring enough boon duration to quickbrand and alacrigade, and try to reach as high crit chance as you can on every build, 100% would be optimal of course. 
---
While I technically agree, we already pay for bag slots (not even account unlock!), bank space, or alts.
---
More of the same wouldn't be unexpected, would it? More guild slots, more build template slots, more ...
---
Awww, I am busy but would love to join next time :(
---
I'm not sure why you're angry or the point you're trying to bring across, but I guess you do live up to your name.
---
Do you have a death wish ? O.O
---
I always see other players in core Tyria maps though
---
lmfao right!
---
Nah, the psycho one who haunts us for years, gets shadowbanned all the time and creates new accounts to keep riling up the rabble against Anet, as if they pissed on his grandmother's grave or something.
---
You don't know what you're doing Qadim!
---
Oh yeah, don't delete your old ones! 
---
If we are ever going to Ahdashim, there's a [confused dragon awaiting for us there](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shiny) because his [mommy](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Goren) never came back (or may have been awaken by Joko at some point since *he* was a friend of Tahlk...), also tons of other djinns... 
---
Now the big question is are they branded or not as Kralk passed just above the city (but this was before he went into the Mist so at this point djinns seemed to resist his corruption as shown in Vabbi).
---
Blindly doing anything is not acceptable, I never once implied that. But every time theres one of those typical bandwagoning posts shit talking its followed by a ton of upvotes and long ass threads of the same topic of discussion going circles and circles. 
---
In fact when someone praises the game its always met with resistance. Not saying it never happens but its kinda rare to find a possitive post that isnt met with salt or cynicism.
---
Unfortunately, I don't have an EU account :[ A friend of mine /u/trixi_morrigna swaps back and forth from both servers to run HP/MP trains. We don't cover exactly the same kind of stuff, but it's a fantastic train if you ever have the time for it! :]
---
Another “no shit sherlock” moment from the one and only idiot, why do you think I picked this name..
---
Everyone's secretly a mesmer. 
---
No problem, and definitely looking forward to it! I like to think my trains are relatively new-player friendly, but keep in mind that HoT maps are super rough. If you end up missing anything, let me know, and I'll see if I can ever help you guys out outside of the train :D
---
I would hate that beyond all hell. I wanna turn off auras, not turn everyone into the same one boring race.
---
Looking forward to it &lt;3
---
Can you just name them? Youre fucking killing me here.
---
\\o/
---
Whoo! I run these monthly too, so if you ever have any other side characters that need dusting off, you know what to look for :D
---
You lead by example from the field. This is covered when the charr guy offers you the pact Marshall job that Logan eventually takes and you turn it down because you like being in the action
---
Unfortunate D: First Saturday of the month, and I don't plan on stopping these anytime soon :\] Hopefully you'll be able to make it to the next one &lt;3
---
A selection of specializations and utility skills that you can save and switch to whenever, rather than having to switch them out manually every time you want to use a different build. So you could have a condi template, a power template, etc that you can instantly switch to.
---
Oh Hot Potato plot of 2016, get your potatoes while you can.
---
Some players still live in the year 2016 where 2 druids were **needed** because their buffs only affected 5 players. "Now" that spirits and Grace of the Land (might) are 10 man you can play any second healer next to a druid. Being rejected from a **training** run as tempest is just made up elitism from noobs who read that druid is meta.
---
Tempest healer is quite good, and most pugs would benefit a lot from taking one in addition to their inevitable druid, but unfortunately that's just not what the meta is right now. Tempest doesn't bring anything *except* a crapton of healing, and that's a problem for two reasons: no fight in the game requires a crapton of healing, and every meta squad composition depends on the healer slot for important boons (most notably, Fury).
---
Ok, thanks for the reply and insight
---
That's the point. Core was dumb as shit
---
Thanks! I've been trying both Fire and Fresh air and have been having pretty good success with Fresh air in ranked. Though I just get absolutely melted by condi builds.
---
&gt; Blindly doing anything is not acceptable, I never once implied that 
---
Okay, and this is what I said
---
&gt; This sub is okay with zero discussion as long as it praises the game. 
---
Posts that blindly praise this game get upvoted regularly. A few days ago there's a post that was literally just "I love this game, it just feels good" with no detailed discussion. It was literally just circlejerking about how exploring was fun and there are lots of things to do. A few weeks ago there was a 16th post about how "Mounts in GW2 are the best implementation of mounts I've ever seen in any game".
---
According to the wiki, literally 4 of the 20 (so 20%) tradable precursors are under 90g. Three of them are the underwater precursors and #4 is the Moot's precursor, which very few people want. 
---
The pre isn't even the most expensive part of crafting a legendary, and there are plenty of ways to make money in this game. What more do you want?
---
Probably just for specializations and utility skills tho. I would think instant gear swapping would eliminate the purpose of legendary gear.
---
You know when they announced alliances Right? Cpild be 2 years until we get gear templates and it could be worse then the custom made solution...
---
but still I hope it will be soon and great :)
---
Surprised no one has mentioned it, but Scrapper could also fill this role.  Probably better for 5-man than 10-man content though.
---
Firebrand renegade and some power DPS build with cleave. Diviner zerk on FB, healing stats on REN, zerk/assassin on full DPS build.
---
But :(. I love uw combat. I wonna rp Aquaman !
---
How do you cause it i would love to command maw like this
---
But then you are truly the only Pact Commander!
---
Is there no overlap between those two groups? Am I a freak of nature?
---
I know I know but all I can do is hope this is pre 2020
---
Havent seen those. Ive been absent from the post for more than a month until just yesterday or the day before that I reared my ugly mug. Speaking from previous experience man.
---
Support is a finicky place to try out new builds. In general, people only really want Chrono/Druid/Renegade/Firebrand for support purposes due to their offensive buff potential. Healers like Scourge, Tempest, and Scrapper are great at what they do (healing/barrier), but aren’t great for anything else but that.
---
In general, you might want to try and learn a Damage Build for training purposes and learn raids on that. Let the more experienced players run the supports and teach you that way. Staff Weaver is still relatively viable in raids if you want to stick with Staff Ele. Additionally, Scepter/Warhorn Tempest is good as well if you want something easy and fun, with the added benefit of still being tempest.
---
Just google everything you don't know. Really, that's the way. Ignore useless advice like "go start again", you will get nothing of value from doing that.   
---
Go out, look up all the content you have missed on the wiki, then go out to do it in game. 
---
Does GGing work for that?
---
Training sessions and guilds should have better things to worry about than excessive amount of healing. Tempest/heal scourage is imo better for training runs than said Druid.
---
I would also want the ability to manage my build storage from an external app. Import/export etc.
---
&gt; spent the rest of my time wondering why mistlock sanctuary was still super laggy even after upgrading my GPU. (R9 285 to 1060)
---
It's because the game is pretty heavily CPU bound, so basically nearly every PC is going to be bottle-necked there. It's also unable to properly take advantage of multiple cores, so really only single threaded CPU performance matters. Since most (but not all) modern games are GPU bound, it's easy to forget that the CPU matters too; I've seen many "gaming builds" that cheap out on the CPU, which I don't like because you never know what games the people following such builds will want to play. 
---
I salvage all rare but great swords for ecto. Given that fewer are dropping these days it'll be more worthwhile, even with the small gamble that you sometimes get no ectos from the salvage.
---
While waiting for it to load I was speculating if they were aiming to make raid selling impossible. But this change is a nice QoL.
---
This is honestly such a weird recommendation for casual play.

---
There you go :D
---
They don't tank using their toughness or HP though. Guild Wars is about damage avoidance with blocks, evades, invulnerable, and dodges.
---
Having a bunch of extra HP doesn't help when the boss will kill you in one or two hits regardless. 
---
I think he was referring to MOB.
---
God I wish we had this in the EU
---
They mention alliances but I doubt there are any more details beyond what we know. It would be nice to get something more detailed though.
---
Not really. Firebrand and Renegade are dead simple for open world, and you can use Berserker gear with them and still get good results.  Firebrand has all the utility you could ever want on the Tomes,  while Renegade is a potent DPS.
---
The only thing weird is the Support Scourge. And that's just cuz' big bro rez his buddies.
---
My husband and I happened to join one of Emi's trains recently and they're by far the best trains to join.
---
The train's not too fast, the commander always helps you if you need it, and it's super easy to follow! Join if you need it, you won't find a better train!
---
I think the actual reason is that there isn't a reason: Mesmer is strong by accident, and not because of any concerted effort on anet's part to make it strong.
---
It's no great secret that anet doesn't understand their own game particularly well, and that GW2 is a classic example of "design by landfill". It just so happens that the random assortment of things in the landfill made Mesmer powerful.
---
The mad lads!
---
If you're asking for PvP:
---
I play ele (tempest) with dagger and focus. You can attack pretty good with fire and with the rest you play rather defensive/supportive.
---
Another build I really like is necro (scourge). Its rather unusual but I think its nice. Here the link for the build (not mine) :
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Scourge_-_Blood_Sage
---
Greetings again!
---
So before diving into Guild Wars, I was doing some general research on what good solo classes are, etc etc.
---
Stumbled upon this link (  [https://www.gamersdecide.com/articles/best-gw2-addons](https://www.gamersdecide.com/articles/best-gw2-addons)  ) that suggests the Tactical Overlay - or TacO .
---
Is this still compatible with the current (all DLC) version of the game?
---
 I'm sorry if this seems weird. I'd just like to be sure it won't bug out in some way. Also I'm extremely tipsy :-D
---
Mainly just curious if I can get some "secretary-style" help with things like raid timers &amp; things. Plan to make my first character a Mesmer so I'll have my mind busy all the time lol.
---
Hmmm, which toon to take, which toon to take...rev, mesmer, or ranger? I think I’ll take Rev this time! See you there!
---
Correct. Removing my templates solution was part a condition for being allowed to do it, and when an official solution does roll out, any future arc build won't have the functionality needed for templates to work
---
It is good communication as well the next raid is possibly coming out next month and Anet rarely tell us about ideas that far a way.
---
I'd probably go mesmer as you get a lot of nice utility such as portals, blinks, stealth and boons (T\_T). 
---
If you're not into that kind of thing then you might wanna go another DPS like Dragonhunter (Guardian), with reaper you'll probably never need any more CC and you can get some utility too whilst having a really nice burst damage.   
---
Reaper is probably the best self buffed class in the game for DPS. You get 25 vuln on enemy, 25 might and quickness in reaper shroud whilst bringing superior CC to many other classes along with high survivability. Only low mobility. 
---
Your hubris is showing.
---
*Slow Clap*
---
Dude!
---
DUDE!
---
ANet needs to hire you.
---

---
No buts! Find the nearest pond and rp Aquaman ! xD
---
Thanks, Tybalt. Have an [apple cider]!
---
Ahh, that hit the spot.
---
Looks like fun! Is Any way those of us who aren't 80 year can participate?
---
Or what :o
---
Mesmer is ANET's little baby since GW1.
---
Eh, don't mind it. It's just a sad little troll.
---
It still works. I'm using it for the current festival.
---
Personally I find it distracting and that it takes away from a lot of the exploration of the game, which is one of the best parts as a new player. But I'm not above turning it on for specific guides and festivals.
---
Kind of "Nice to have when you need it, but relying on it isn't great."
---
I crafted 10k elder wood planks and share your pain.
---
That's just how the class goes. There is a skill that transfers them but it's not all that useful.
---
If you watch closely you'll see that clones do basically 0 damage. Clones are your ammunition. They feed your shatter skills and have basically no other use. Ideally, they only live for a few seconds before you use them.
---
View them more as a resource to be managed and spent rather than an AI assistant.
---
A lot of things they're doing were probably already in the works. They simply didn't talk about them as a matter of policy. Just because they've now said something doesn't mean it wasn't already planned. The difference is now they're communicating.
---
Something they should have been doing all along. Now it’s too late.  A lot of the players have left, most of them aren’t coming back, and no one cares anymore. 
---
Communication is progress!
