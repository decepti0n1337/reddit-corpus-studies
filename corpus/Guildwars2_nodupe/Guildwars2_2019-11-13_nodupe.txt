Yeah that is pretty sad, I was lucky that FSP was pretty active and also occasionally a top tier WvW server, really does the gamemode unjustice for all those lower tier servers. Glad you managed to enjoy it anyhow!
---
---
---
unfortunately I agree. since the templates announcement I simply stopped playing, went over to ESO and didn't check the gw2 Reddit much anymore. I'll unlock the new episode and may even play it a bit, but since all my builds are gone (in arc) I really don't see much of a point, everything I worked so hard on (like my legendary armours and weapons) is pretty much useless without paying more money.
---

---
ANet made it clear they don't want me as a player, so I see no point making a big fuss, I assume a lot of other former players simply decided it's not worth the effort to protest (given ANets track record of not caring unless it's a huge uproar, which this will never be), and moved on as well.
---
Maybe they have a bigger plan for bear, given it’s greater significance in the old stories there.
---
If Jormag eats all of the spirits, I imagine the Norn identity crisis will be pretty significant.  
---
Though to my understanding, even if they are slain, they can reconstitute over time and function similarly to thoughtforms.
---
Yeah while I do get the occasional spikes in hot zones, pof is just on a whole other level. 
---
I've been enduring the lag these last few days but today was so bad I couldn't get anything done.
---
Only they know the real numbers.  If it was going to hurt their bottom line they would take a different route so I'm assuming this is just a "people come and go" sort of thing.  Sucks to have vets leave but that's the nature of gaming.
---
Beautiful. Cannot wait to master the spirit of shadowy birb.
---
I stopped logging in game when arc build template was blocked (and more than half of my guild too), so i will relog only for real update like real expansion or good raid, new wvw system ecc, so I'm done with these clowns for now.
---
I would probably suggest something like "LGBT Characters". That would be how I'd assume most people would search for it on the wiki.
---
People were afraid there wouldn’t be any raids or fractals, anet sure proved them wrong by not releasing any raids or fractals!
---
if there still one lying around I'm game.
---
Oooo 3 strike missions. Happy! :)
---
Yeah lets go back to season one where people complained there were no new maps.
---
Oh I see. Minorities are only human if they're not minorities. Solid logic. Got it.
---
Charr accountancy, all normal. Human slave for heavy labor on background.
---
There won't be anymore raids, more than likely. The population is evaporating at an exponential rate on a weekly basis. My own static is crumbling because there is absolutely nothing to look forward to, and because they were negatively affected by ArenaNet's scummy profit model with regards to build templates.
---
Endgame in this game is pretty much almost dead. This update does nothing to ameliorate that.
---
It's also not unprecedented for ArenaNet to listen to the feedback and work on it:
---
- Heart of Thorns got a major overhaul based on feedback that made the maps much more well-received.
---
- Path of Fire got a reward and structure overhaul for its metas which made them more populated and run on a regular basis.
---
- The Roller Beetle underwent changes based directly on player feedback to improve its endurance regain and change it to decay when dismounting instead of resetting.
---
- The Skimmer underwent changes to improve its speed and deceleration when changing from water to ground and vice versa.
---
- The Skyscale acquisition timegates were greatly lessened after the outrage by the community.
---
- The Warclaw received an enemy dismount skill after many gave feedback that Warclaws killed roaming.
---
- The recently-added "customize" UI was iterated on to alphabetise the stat order and add a much-needed search bar, directly in response to player feedback.
---
- Twilight Oasis was made shorter and less tedious due to negative reception on how lengthy the fractal is before you finally reach the boss.
---
- The most egregiously unpopular fractal instabilities (Birds and Slippery Slope) were outright removed after complaints from the playerbase. Social Awkwardness also went through many iterations before settling on what we have now.
---
That's just off the top of my head, but I can go on and on. And before anyone jumps at me for white knighting: **I'm not here to say their communication and iteration is perfect.** Far from it. Especially lately, communication leaves a lot to be desired. However, I am holding out hope that they will take at least some of our feedback into account regarding templates, and I don't think that hope is unprecedented at all, because they have listened to and acted on feedback before in situations very similar to this one.
---
That's insane! Never realised there was that much detail. My favourite bits of the game are where your profession gives you special options, like in the living story 4 episode where we break out of the cell
---
Yeah it's strange how much of a "bond" you can form with a good commander!  I really miss Qla on FSP, really a top tier commander which I have loads of memories with. Even though I rarely interacted with them on a one to one basis.
---
A good community really does make a huge difference. Never really got into a good WvW guild sadly, being a bit more casual I never felt I could follow the time schedules many guilds imposed. Those that didnt impose any rules  sadly ended up pretty inactive or just straight up died eventually, pros and cons with that type of thing.
---
well it would be enough if they would shorten it by a small amount
---
for example Twilight Oasis was to long so they removed one sandbinder.
---
They could remove 1 bag you have to carry or the trashmobs before black Pete or the entire dinos at the beginning.
---
and while we're at it can we remove the entire trap phase of deepstone just cause the way to the first orb is only spaming special action key. way to second orb is the only real part of it and way to orb 3 will be skipped anyway. There is not a single part/quest/event as bad as this.... oh wait there is spirit run.......
---
Ok. Checked. The box will deliver your current choices in the board, no matter how many you stack.
---
Welcome to the GW2 Community outrage cycle.
---
Please don't tell me you're encouraging people to not participate in WvW. We need people actually playing it, not mooching off of it.
---
&gt; Yeah, that's what I called autoclicker-type gameplay.
---
If that's what you think then this game just isn't for you then.  It's fine, not all games are for all people.
---
I just checked after rest. It's option #3.
---
&gt; * [...] all combinations have the same ID and stack, and give the same result, the last combination selected, [...] the 'combined' box will give you whatever choices you've picked the last time, and changing the choices will change what the box gives.
---
No one's even reading this lol
---
Anybody else think the Essence Mastery sounds too thematically close to guardian virtues?
---
https://media0.giphy.com/media/3o7TKGASactq3gIAhi/giphy.gif
---
And yet PVP received fewer changes overall compared to PVE. It's quite ignorant to state it was developed as a PVP game considering this fact.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I suggest you go watch the first few trailers and the manifesto again. It's very evident what the main focus of GW2 was, is and always has been.
---
I think that just because they have a spotlight on them, it's easier to see wherever things fail to deliver, and vice versa. They haven't had much written for them lately. I still thought they had a great chemistry up until they kinda put it on the back burner (mid-s3)... not sure why but as i understand it, a lot of people don't want relationships in the story. That was the complaints I saw most anyway, which saddens me a bit. :)
---
I am constantly playing ranged DH in open world meta and map completion. I haven’t done fractals in forever and never done dungeons or raid so I cannot comment there but I do enjoy playing with ranged DH regardless of the damage. Gets what I need to do done.
---
It was about time we had some focus on cats.
---
Not charr, forget charr. We need more cats. Cats tonics, more home instance cats, more cat minis, and also actual cat people with no horns and actual cat ears. No need to be original as long as there's more cats, just call them "Cat sìth" or something. Also, cat skins for all mounts. 
---
Make everything cats. Except musicals. Nothing against musicals, but there should not be musicals about cats. 
---
So we shall have more cats, and a musical with no cats. 
---
We've solved all problems GW2 was facing, everyone! Give yourselves pats in the back and go feed your cats!
---
Getting some GoT Hardhome vibes from the trailer. Does this mean we get to fight some ice zombies?? Excellent trailer Anet can't wait for Ep.1!
---
I would also want them to expand the smallest ones like Bloodstone fen, Southsun, and Bitterfrost.
---
They asked for "feedback," but they were really asking for a circlejerk.
---
That was before half of the already dwindling raid community quit over build templates. Chances are those projects are on the chopping block in favor of new reward-less strikes.
---
Well, lore team creates something they might be proud of for months if not years.
---
Balance team? "Well, I nerfed that one mesmer signet once, and now everybody hates me..."
---
The problem is not too many maps, it's that map metas do not scale adequately to low populations. Everything should be soloable if there is literally only one person in the area, the content should be achievable by the amount of people present.
---
That's an assumption that the people playing are of average intelligence.
---
It COULD be bad design. 
---
Or it COULD just be that the subset of people playing the game are just lack game sense and can't understand it even if it is designed well.
---
I mean it is a possibility, and I wouldn't put it past GW2's player base after seeing how casual it is. Fair points made though. Although I have to say GW2 does an okay job with showing mechanics. It's more so show rather than tell in this game. 
---
E.G Sirens reef, the mechanics present in the last boss are there, one for each boss. It's just the endless chill fields and projectile spam that makes it a cleanse + reflect/destroy + dps fest. That's all it is.
---
Another would be VG, you get your three RGB electromen with their mechanics separately before the boss. 
---
Similarly, the ball in shattered observatory is there for bouncing before the boss, and the miniboss does similar knockdown ball attacks. 
---
Though I think containment may not be explained enough for bomb on the second boss of Shattered Observatory. There should be something like maybe a few containment fields where you have to run across a section and hide in there once or twice or it'll blow you up.
---
A lot of it comes down to game sense though. If you don't play many games, your game sense is probably not going to be good as someone who has spent a lifetime playing games (Wow, really?). It's a really overlooked part of gaming, you might just understand how to play games, how they work and thus solve out things much faster than someone who doesn't play many games at all. In the end you can't cater to everyone, either you cater to the casual players with not as good a game sense to the more "hardcore" players. Sure maybe it'd be nice to have every single thing laid out on a silver platter for you when it comes to mechanics, but at the same time it would add a lot of clutter.
---
At some point you'd have to reach a decision, how many mechanics do we explain, and how many do we leave out. If you put all mechanics in, it'll be seen as a "time waste", or "time-gated garbage events before the boss". If you don't put enough in you get "BAD DESIGN". So yea, it's a balance that has to take into account the general game sense of the players playing that certain gamemode/content.
---
For starters, the choices in the hero boxes need to be greatly improved:
---
* The trade contract choice should be at least 250. A measly 100 can hardly get you anything decent in the daily heart vendors.
---
* They should give boxes to choose more exotic and ascended recipes, not the same ascended insignia/inscription every time.
---
* And they should give a choice of the rare materials used to craft the stats of the crystal desert.
---
Really is. :) there are a lot of research being done in this area, and for a long time - especially around Intrinsic motivation &amp; Extrinsic motivation. Idea is to how to make the job inherently happier for you, and you are self motivated, rather than giving you a carrot every step of the way. Examples could be work from home feature, or flexibility in logging in and log out, a simple thank you from senior manager, facetime with CEO, a personalised gift for your hobby, announcing to the team when you did great etc etc. 
---
Below is a recent article in Harvard Business Reviw, which is not too dry to read. https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/forget-cash-here-are-better-ways-to-motivate-employees
---
still do afaik
---
Every map they add the more of a mess the lfg becomes...gives me conniptions.
---
I don't get the complaint, do you guys have every legendary weapon allready?
---
I know it’s popular to complain about old masteries not being used, but a lot of them wouldn’t fit with lore. There were NEVER beetles here, who tf would be putting that emblem on doors up here? This one’s not the best example honestly but still. And if they did reuse old masteries people would just turn around and complain it doesn’t fit in the lore.  
---
Better example: when thermal vents came out people were like, “but we already have nuhoch wallows”. But if anet added those wallows in ember bay and bitterfrost and draconis mons people would bitch that there are no nuhoch there so why is it like this. Basically people are overreacting
---
Who is reporting this as an exploit?
---
I plan to do a proper polite criticism post here that will also include a paragraph about raids and fractals plus swiss and alliances vs story releases.
---
&gt; Those are all gameplay changes.
---
... Since when is updating the Customize UI a gameplay feature?
---
&gt; Build templates are a gemstore feature, not a gameplay or content feature. They won't change them.
---
I'll keep going then.
---
- Black Lion chests were updated to remove items that players were tired of getting from the drop tables like Tomes of Knowledge and Bank/TP/Merchants.
---
- Permanent gathering tools were given the wardrobe treatment and glyphs, based on widespread feedback that stated that the skin of the gathering tool and the benefit should be decoupled.
---
- Black Lion Chest exclusives were given alternative methods to obtain them through statuettes or other means after disdain from the community that the skins they want are locked behind gambling.
---
- Mount licences were updated to have a pricier mount selection option after "mount gate" where Reddit, news sites, and popular YouTubers heavily criticised the mount adoption gambling scheme they had presented us.
---
Gemstore features get iterated on *all the time*. I'm not sure why you think build templates being a gemstore feature excludes the possibility that they'll update them in any way.
---
True that, just checked the wiki, and that's certainly a female face. Though if we only assume their gender based on the voice, then the two asuras in the home instance with the "switched up" voices should also count xd
---
I would say casuals are more toxic than raiders... raiders are usually only toxic if you join a raid and lie about your skill level. Some casuals are toxic about anything and everything.
---
The laws you're talking about apply to gambling, not currencies.  In order for video games to fall under gambling laws in the US is when they meet the test of *consideration*, *chance*, and *prize*.  This has been discussed in detail in the past, so if you're interested in the topic, Google search old threads, since it's a lot of typing to re-explain.
---
The IRS does a poor job in explaining their intent of describing virtual currencies like Bitcoin.  The only game that I can think of that might meet the threshold is Diablo 3's Auction House, where you could exchange virtual currencies for cash.  Outside of that, it would require new laws to target virtual currencies in video games
---
I am still friends with a player -- well, I friended him, he has no idea who I am (fine.  Go ahead.  Call me a stalker)...  okay, moving on.  I still have a person on my friends list because at the Marionette it came down to just him.  We had all the circles done except for the one he was in.  He was the only character left alive.  We were all cheering for him, and he finished it off so we won.  It was a fantastic feeling being on the razor's edge, hoping for the best while fearing for the worst and ending up with sweet victory.  Yes, Marionette was the best.
---
Personally, I use a Keep file but yeah I love being able to make these shitty little spitball builds and try them out. This is going full tinfoil hat theory here, but what if the chat links were ANet's attempt to fuck with NCSoft? NCSoft demands that they monetize it to hell, the devs don't want to do it but they have no control so they add this feature that basically renders build storage slots (and even build template slots) meaningless.
---
You might be right. Just compared the icebrood charr to Almorra's model, and there are some very noticeable similarities.
---
Be the change you want to see.
---
I'm certain you've heard that one before.
---
It is up to nobody but you yourself to fill these maps with players if you dislike their current state.
---
Obviously there will be maps in the game that aren't as densely packed with players as say Lion's Arch.
---
That's simply the nature of these games. However, there is nothing stopping you from changing that state of being.
---
Tidal waves? Elaborate?
---
but the problem isn't that. the problem is all the new masteries are useless crap. mastery system was supposed to enhance your account - like upgrading gliding, upgrading mount passive stats, giving mounts skills, enabling mentor, autoloot, new downed skill. those were some good ones. the rest map related travel toys should be baseline accessible or locked behind map currency - not a mastery
---
Started my journey yesterday! Congrats.
---
Thank you :)
---
If this is considered as an exploit, I'm surprised this wasnt added to the game to add a rpg element.
---
Snowy and dark. I like it
---
While DS is fun when completed in like 45 mins, it really hurts to spend more than 1h30m into it because people leech/afk &amp;so
---
Nah, I need 100 more new maps to explore.
---
They've been doing a lot of that. In Head of the Snake when you go back into the manor, you can pick the lock if you're a thief. I believe you can do the same thing in Bastion of the Penitent before the Samarog fight.
---
That's weird, I see something actually on the table...
---
[removed]
---
My point is that raids are not all about the loot like you make it look like in your post. Also, the quote from your comment is quite a dumb thing to say since there are better methods to make gold than raids.
---
&gt;the fastest loot per second
---
code please if you have any more - THANK YOU
---
we just need guard with banners and alacrity.
---
&gt;Right then I'm thinking if DS is that dead, the game is really dying. I'm an occasional gem purchaser, but now the wallet is closed. I even started thinking of what other game I should look into. 
---
Don't be so dramatic
---
You couldn't find anyone in LFG for one meta cycle? Big deal, it happens. Not every meta will be completed and not every map instance will succeed. That doesn't mean the whole game is dying.
---
Right, except everyone was in a big hubbub (read: hyperbolic outrage) about building templates of which we've even gotten two free. Truly, the game's end!
---
Also, as I've said before, instanced content is NOT what GW2 is about apart from telling its story and even that has shifted to a more open world approach recently.
---
You're just wrong.
---
Depends on when you play. There should be people around daily reset. Or look to your guild if you have one.
---
I don't understand. I am not aware of any currency whether game related or otherwise that can instantly convert without a 3rd party... even GW2 gold you need a 3rd party to facilitate the (TOS breaking, I know) sale of.
---
Same issue with Shadowstep, if you cast it then swap traitlines (not even using templates, manually swapping) it will autocast Shadow Return. It'll also delete your shadow portal, fun stuff!
---
Maybe try hanging out with different Russians.
---
If you only need ignis, you can defeat him /her with only 3 people in the time limit, probably two. Even though it's legendary if you avoid the green slime and all the area damage then you'll be fine.
---
The pre events are easily soloed too
---
You complain about dead lfg but you don't open a squad yourself. Come on..
---
The biggest problem is the only people who are really mad are the hardcore players, a good amount of which have enough gold stashed away to afford what they really need using gold&gt;gems, and use the GW2 clipboard extension someone made for the builds.
---
They'll hopefully iterate on it a bit and fix a few things, but with the new release coming up it won't be for like a month probably.
---
Done DS 3 or 4 times very recently and it was paaaacked
---
You probably just got thrown into a crap instance, which is no reason to say "the game is dying"
---
I even hate just quoting that phrase tbh
---
Maybe people wanna play the game not the UI. Especially if things like build templates are trash.
---
so long as the narrative walks you through it and deals with smaller stories its fine. GW2 spent the entire personal story keeping it small until it ended with your big score in spearheading the kill on Zhaitan, LS1 was you doing small stuff with only small nods from people as to who you were, LS2 followed a similar beat.
---
It wasn't until HoT and Anet reacting to the "REEEEEEE WHY AREN'T I THE HERO REEEEEEE" that they made the Commander into the be and end all of the narrative. They spent LS3 dialing it back a bit, and PoF was a fresh start with you being that accomplished warrior from a foreign land in the narrative, nobody knew who you were so there was very little worship. LS4 was about on par with LS3.
---
Though here? The new ~~season~~*saga* has only thrown the title at you as an insult. Smoldur mocked you for it, Bangarr used it with respect but only so far as you commanding Aurene went (and you don't lol) and everybody else just calls you that because voice acting means they can never use your name. I wonder if the season will carry on with it being used as a mark against you, the wayward commander who left their army to die while they pursued personal interests with a ragtag guild.
---
Oh nice, putting words in my mouth. Where did anybody say they are not human?
---
It would also be cool if there was some reference to Norn characters who already follow Raven
---
Roller Beetles are locked behind a somewhat tedious achievement so yeah, they don't want a bunch of areas that force people to go back through old episodes and grind out the achievements/masteries for that when they could add a new one accessible to everyone easily.
---
&gt; black lion key,
---
For every character who runs that episode, not a one-time account thing like in most other cases.
---
It did sound more like she was injured and grunting the words rather than saying them.
---
I don't think we find her *corrupted*, but injured among the keep that fell
---
This is Arenanet's whole business model: they significantly below the mean for the industry, so they mostly get people with little or no experience willing to take low pay to get a foot in the door.  Once they build up a few years experience, they can go get a real job somewhere else for way more money.
---
So they're continually losing devs just as they become experienced enough to know what they're doing and replace them with people who will repeat a bunch of mistakes as they relearn everything via trial and error.
---
LMAO - wrong about what? Go fire up a mantra and then switch a trait line. It'll reset the mantra just like it always has.
---
https://tenor.com/view/wind-waker-fuck-you-link-middle-finger-gif-14356155
---
New maps are the biggest thing I look forward to. And unless they get some serious phasing tech, overhauling old maps for story purposes just ruins the experience for new players.
---
ty for mathias , it's my favorite boss
---
subzero temperatures for a desert beetle too
---
I imagine, writs give more stats than other utilities, but aren't used in raids proper because of their ridiculous requirements to activate. So using them against a golem when you've told everyone the build is using a weaker utility would give stats higher than anyone could knowingly achieve.
---
Anecdotal evidence is anecdotal.
---
Man, what is it with these doomsayers recently?
---
At least they somewhat tried before.
---
It's just another one of many chips at veteran player enthusiasm with the game. I think you'll find that a lot of people just end up drifting away or stop taking the game seriously. It will be interesting to do a postmortem of the game in some decade from now. They probably aren't planning on changing anything about the build templates and it's probably too late in development to ever expect anything to happen from Arenanet. It is what it is, just more bullshit/wasted potential from the studio. Pretty sure they went on record saying that you could still use 3rd party build templates, which will make this a mostly neutral change (although I hate how it's connected with pvp and wvw). 
---
As far as fan outrage, you can't expect people to constantly talk about this for literally months. Eventually, people move on, which is normal and good. It wouldn't even make sense for people to just constantly blast it. Hell, I haven't really talked about it since it launched and I provided my criticism. Not much reason to dwell on the fact that it sucks, so I didn't really see the purpose in saying any more on it personally.
---
fuck off dude.
---
I know it's too late but I do want to tell you that this was very sweet of you. Thank you for thinking of others.
---
I'm pretty sure she was just hitting on Jory in that episode.
---
True, if you're using a writ and saying you're using a sharpening stone I can see the issue. I just find it odd that the requirements for writs are considered unreasonable when Scholar Runes (which it seems every Power build and it's grandmother uses) have the exact same requirement for a comparable boost.
---
Yes we do, but I consider asexuality to be a sexuality. If human sexuality is a function of many, many variables representing the possible attractions, then asexuality is when you let all of their values go to zero. I don't believe asexuality is somehow outside of sexuality or detached from it, especially since asexuality itself is a continuum, not just the point at zero, but some non-empty region surrounding it.
---
Hey man. I'm one of the fellow critics myself, but I just wanted to commend you for your well-thought posts and the time you have taken to write them.
---
It's very important that even us critics have a more realistic view on the situation.
---
Good luck! Maybe you'll work on Destiny 2 - so we're still 'in touch' via another game ;-)
---
Managed to get the back-piece recently on NA. I had to solo the pre group events, but people showed up for the bosses. Only took 2-3 other people for each one, so see if you can rally some friends.
---
I'd like to retcon that fact as just hitting on Marjory. She IS a Mesmer after all. Mesmers like to flirt.
---
Then again, she is a god damned idiot, so it's possible she may freeze.
---
Almost all of the mounts in their cash shop were available to be earned in game at one point during temporary content. People bitched about it so they turned it into a profit, and some of them are cheap at around 3€ per.
---
I largely agree but I think arenanet's implementation is kinda skewed. In a lot of other MMOs, there's no pre-boss description or subtext really at all. This was something GW2 was praised for as innovation on launch. But as the game looked towards hardcore content it started failing them. The intricacies and actual mechanics required to make a real challenge, is way more than a sentence will ever be able to do. I don't think it's right to call anet wrong for trying to make hardcore content in GW2 at all, the community asked for it, and it's something which has in a lot of places worked out I feel. But you can definitely see the cracks formed by how the game was originally designed, which didn't grow well with their various updates and ideas.
---
This causes a question though: If anet's implementation at the time was relatively revolutionary, what came before it? What did previous games do, which GW2 seemingly is missing? It's something which at least personally, I didn't reflect on at all in my first couple years of playing, it took me until HoT to really think on why GW2 hard content felt so different to approach blind. The reason I came to was a lack of telegraphing. In much of the MMOs I've played, be it in dungeons or raids, bosses tend to show their hand before it's played. Sometimes it's by them interrupting a trash mob clear earlier in so the party can see what it looks like when they attack. Much more often it's by the enemy being visually clear in what it intends to be. Big fuck-off hammer? Boy I wonder if he'll have knockbacks and big physical AoE. Magic staff, robes, skull for a face? Where are those tombstones bring on the adds! The fight arena has some odd terrain in it? Better keep that in mind! It's largely stuff which can be picked up on the fly, or understood immediately as it happens. In GW2, the bosses never feel very visually descriptive of what they actually do. In part because the game is heavily reliant on buff/condi bar management to draw it's difficulty, which is not a visible thing at all, but also because they have no visual profile for things to follow. Characters routinely use the big fuck-off weapons as magical focii, and small weapons to output lots of power big attacks. Except for times when that's not the case! The inconsistency is a problem, the lack of a visual profile that players can attach to on a global scale compounds on everything else. If Anet wants New Player Experiences to be like, good, in hardcore content, and to have a good feel in the bridge that brings in the fresh blood, they need to make more visually understandable content. Which would have  great side-effect of making encounters just straight better by making them feel more visually interactive.
---
the Pyre shrine in Plains of Ashford gives you 10 minutes of might and Protection, and 3 minutes of Swiftness if you /salute near it
---
They're using GW1's engine, so these environments are being made in a 16+ year old game. (GW1 was announced in April 2003, so the foundations of the game are at least that old.)
---
'Purely cosmetic' is the worst argument ever.
---
'Purely cosmetic' has been this game's endgame since it's fuckin' inception. Companies can AND WILL use predatory tactics to fully monetize a game via cosmetics and have been doing so for years. They think of players as whales and herd animals when they create systems that normalise and incentivize spending as the default way of playing.
---
Sad to see ya leave gw2 glad to see ya part of Bungie love both games. Can't wait to see what you can do with Destiny 2 and hopefully I. The future Destiny 3.
---
"in her battle-dress", off topic but man that just reminds me of the 1st season of RWBY
---
We're only one zone away from Jaga Moraine and Sifhalla(or it's remains) now. Yay!
---
&gt; So first, let's establish what's been said:
---
Ok, let's go.
---
&gt; 1) You implied that sexuality is intrinsic to human behavior.
---
Yes, I did that.
---
&gt; 2) I said asexuals exist and are not intrinsically sexual.
---
Yes, I agree.
---
&gt; Both 1 and 2 cannot be true simultaneously. For 1 to be true, asexual humans would have to not exist. For 2 to be true, sexuality could not be intrinsic to human behavior. 
---
And that's where you're wrong. 1 and 2 can be true simultaneously - in a way. And that way is that we're talking about TYPICAL things! You approach it mathematically, but this isn't how everyday language works (unless you're Sheldon Cooper). Of course sexuality is intrinsic to human behavior, but there are other people (like you stated) that don't have that. But this doesn't mean the other way round that they are not human. It is ONE of the features.
---
In this case it makes sense because the territory hasn't changed hands at all. Only the Norn and Kodan are interested in living that far north.
---
No lag at all here the past couple of days here in Northern Europe. Is this at particular times of day?
---
I had bad lag around reset which cleared about an hour later, spiking upto 4k ping. My internet wasnt bad atall but the game just wasnt loading properly (guild level back to zero, gems appearing as If i just received them on the right, rubberbanding). Not sure if the game or  bad relay server for me.
---
Raid bosses are some of the most boring fights ever, partly due to how classes are designed, the other part is beating on a god damn pillar for 5 minutes.
---
might just be me but i getting more randomly disconnected from the game servers recently
---
Imagine wasting your time and energy worrying about who is and isn't represented in a fantasy world.
---
&gt; Right, except everyone was in a big hubbub (read: hyperbolic outrage) about building templates of which we've even gotten two free.
---
Ah right, well the patch certainly also dealt with all those fears thanks to its numerous changes to build templates that allayed everyone's concerns.
---
&gt; Also, as I've said before, instanced content is NOT what GW2 is about
---
Ah, the game direction understander has logged on. The game shipped with 25 explorable dungeon paths each with their own unique weapon and armor set. The games first major permanent content update was the introduction of fractals. Raids and fractal updates were one of the biggest selling points of its first expansion. In other words, just because you say "gw2 is not about this" does not mean that is true.
---
Fashion wars is endgame because of how much content is created when you go after that perfect look. There are vastly more armor and weapon sets to be acquired by playing the game rather than by buying them on the gem store. Collecting all the right pieces will have you doing dungeons, playing metas, hunting achievements, revisiting old content, working on legendaries or specialization collections, and much more. If the only good fashion was gem store fashion, no one would consider that end game since you can purchase that as a level 1 if you so desired. Some of my best styled characters that I have entered (and won) fashion wars contest with are wearing absolutely no gem store pieces. In fact, most fashion wars judges won't allow gem store outfits at all, and frown upon excessive individual gem store pieces. There's no reason that buying a ton of gem store items should be seen as the "default way of playing" since you're not punished in any way by not having them, nor are you limited to wearing an ugly brown sack if you only wear in-game obtainable items.
---
As for "The game has to profit somehow"...well...it does. I'm not sure why that makes you angry. Nothing other than cosmetic and connivence items are on the gem store (nothing that gives a competitive advantage), so if you consider that "literally everything" maybe a dress up doll simulator would be more your game?
---
Currently the meaningful content is free, and the unnecessary luxury items are what's in the store. Are you proposing it should be the other way around? We pay for the content and get meaningless cosmetics for free? Or are you just wanting it all to be free, since apparently "The game has to profit somehow" is a terrible argument?
---
That's one ugly baby
---
That's generous.
---
It's hard to tell if those are reskinned though, and the Exalted/Forgotten structure design is **very** iconic since it's based off of Hall of Heroes from GW1 so it's not something they'd reuse lightly. Especially since this is mostly norn/jotun homelands - you'd expect norn and jotun architecture over reskinned exalted/Forgotten architecture.
---
&gt;And Jahai had like 2 walls with stuff behind.
---
Closer to a dozen, but they were all chest or volatile magic niches so they were of no consequence. Not that Domain of Kourna had much use for them either.
---

---
After watching the trailer again I'm pretty sure it's Almorra's head in the jar, not Raven.
---
From a design perspective this makes a bit of sense. Not in the "gotta make players stay in this new map longer" direction (well that too), but in the sense that they likely don't want to limit Season 5 content behind Season 4 masteries as not all the players will own Season 4.
---
We may see the return of the more situational HoT-S4 masteries, especially with them bundling HoT with PoF now, but I wouldn't be expecting a heavy use of them.
---
I expect we'll see a lot more use of HoT and PoF masteries in the Icebrood Saga, compared to the use of S3 and S4 masteries.
---
Meaning this guy just comes to shit talk and has people that know it.
---
This saga sure is just looking like a renamed living word.........
---
The point is, this is an action adventure game. Players who are better at economics should not have an advantage over players who are better act action/adventure gameplay. The system should not be designed to award economics over adventure. It's not asking for handouts, it's asking for a system that best rewards the core gameplay mechanics of the game.
---
How much did they pay you?
---
Since Russians communicate using Beluga whales, are we gonna get Underwater mounts? Hype!!
---
&gt; Is wvw alliance update gettint any closer?
---
Yes, it does. Unfortunately, space-time in between gets equally elongated, so it is still the same distance :-(
---
Gotcha. By the time you hit 2200 you’ll be a beast too! Win-win
---
They didn't though - trrident, spear and speargun are still missing.

---
wow is still making a lot of money. it's also about twice as old as gw2. of course blizzard have other titles but what really made them a big name *was* wow, they didn't try and reinvent the wheel (and fail) all the time and stuck to what worked (for the most part) and didn't try to fuck with everything people enjoyed, they consistently put out updates for the game and as a result they have succeeded where anet haven't. while blizzard have been getting some bad pr over the last few months - year or so, they are nowhere near as bad off as anet are. while anet may still be a bit profitable, look at what happened to city of heroes (another thing owned by ncsoft), it was still profitable, not the most profitable game but it wasn't in the red, and it got shut down and people are still sore about that. i wouldn't be surprised if they did the same to gw2 after the layoffs don't appear to have worked. blizzard is still 100 x more well off than anet ever will be, their blunders aren't big enough to crash a game of that size even if they get mocked for them all the time, too many people still play wow and classic wow.
---
&gt; They're using GW1's engine, so these environments are being made in a 16+ year old game.
---
Quite a few games (series) were built upon the old engines of previous games. As always "heavily modified" though (instances in GW1 to open world in GW2, etc.) so they're certainly not the same game anymore. A well known example would be WoW using the real-time strategy engine of Warcraft III (started in 1998).
---
Try to do it around reset(12am utc). So 10pm-2am utc.
---
good for you, I stopped spending too.
---
&gt; It's not asking for handouts, it's asking for a system that best rewards the core gameplay mechanics of the game.
---
You are asking for your preferred style to be rewarded better than someone else. The TP has been apart of this MMORPG since the beginning, Im not sure how much more core it can get.
---
Good stuff!  Glad to see you guys able to chat properly.
---
Do whatever the fuck you want.
---
Just to throw in another data point.
---
EU, no spikes raiding or doing my daily gathering routine (including LS4 maps) aside from in the Guild Hall. Bit more of an issue if wandering around PoF maps.
---
From the timezone I'm guessing it's not NA?  I'd be willing to help, but I'm NA.
---
As long as she doesnt get an apple stand in LA, shes good
---
&gt; You want your preferred play style to be rewarded better than someone else. 
---
I will repeat for the back of the room, I do **not** "want my preferred play style to be rewarded better than someone else."
---
What I **want** is for the core playstyle *of the game we are playing* to be rewarded better than niche playstyles *in the game we are playing.* 
---
If this was an economics simulator game, and I rolled in wanting bank robbery to be the most rewarding way to play the game, then sure, you would 100% have a point here, **but that is not what is happening here, so stop trying to press this argument.**
---
&gt;TP flipping is one aspect of the game you can explore.
---
It is, but it is currently a *massively unbalanced* aspect of the game. It is magnitudes more rewarding than any other playstyle. If one class in PvP was massively more successful than any other, the correct response to that is not "well, you can always just play that class then," it is "then we need to adjust the balance so that it is no longer unbalanced."
---
&gt;Thats essentially what tp flipping amounts to, the players putting in the extra effort get more gold or reward out of the same activity than those players who put in less effort do.
---
But the problem is that this only applies *if* you put that effort *into* "being good at the TP." Applying that *same* amount of time and effort getting good at any *other* aspect of the game will not provide remotely close to the same results. 
---
If this were a matter of "spend 100 hours 'getting good' at the TP and make more gold than spending only five minutes getting good at the TP," OR "spend 100 hours 'getting good' at running events and make more gold than spending only five minutes getting good at running events," then there would be no issue, fine. The issue is that *spending 100 hours getting good at running the TP is more profitable than spending 5000 hours doing whatever you like anywhere else in the game.* 
---
This is not good game balance, that balance needs to be fixed. 
---
&gt;The TP IS a core game play aspect.
---
No it is not. 
---
[Here is the official GW2 web page.](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/) It discusses combat, competitive play, dynamic events, personal story, etc. Find me where it talks about cornering the market on onion futures. You may play the TP, but playing the TP is NOT one of the core aspects of this game, and should not be treated as such.
---
Aye, I think going west to Drakkar Lake for Episode 2 makes sense. Then eps 3-4 can be the Verdant Cascades (because that area's been seriously unexplored and it also prevents terrain burnout of snow zone after snow zone). Then probably 5-6 will be Norrhart and the Icecliff Chasms, ending the whole saga at the Eye of the North. 
---
Or at least that's how I'd lay it out if I wanted to go full nostalgia, instead of going even further north and discovering new areas to explore.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Technically correct is the best form of correct.
---
heh it reminds me of my favourite wiki deep dive on a characters sexuality ['Sarah's favorite flowers are lilacs. This (along with her lack of attraction towards Clark, when he's visting her at the hospital) hints that Sarah might be a lesbian.'](https://smallville.fandom.com/wiki/Sarah_Conroy)
---
They did say this Saga would be partially inspired by Lovecraft, so... we'll see.
---
Guildie of mine finished this about a month ago. If you're on a US server, I can try to help you. 
---
My experience in smaller zones is that LFG doesn't help as much as map chat and a tag.
---
Anyway if you're on a US server hit me up on Vayne.8563. I'm sure we can get this done.
---
A question for the sages. Scholar runes also give +ferocity in their sixth tier, equivalent to 10% (crit) damage. Ogre and Deadeye runes are the only other +power +ferocity runes, and they lack this last stat. In fact, the only ones that have it are Eagle and Golemancer runes, which are +precision. So it's likely Scholar runes are run more for the +10% damage; the conditional +5% damage is icing.
---
unids are always level 80, character level doesn't matter. afaik it's best to identify and salvage all except exotics, list those on tp
---
I guess this comes down to use having different views on what a core aspect of the game is and what should or shouldnt be a thing. The TP is a core aspect of the game. There is nothing wrong with players being able to make a profit playing the TP, even if that profit is greater than other areas of the game. Its a different beast and you spend you time playing the TP vs playing the game. Thats okay.
---
The Exalted didn't exist in GW1. They were created ~50 years after the events of Nightfall / Eye of the North. Tarir was created around the same time. Most likely these structures - if not a retextured asset - were likely made ~50 years after GW1 too.
---
Kesho is the oddity of Exalted structures, because it was Vlast's nursery and Vlast hatched sometime between Prophecies and Eye of the North. It isn't clear if that was built after GW1, or merely after Prophecies as retroactive continuity (mechanical explanation for us not seeing it being that "maps are stuck in time unless updated").
---
Of course they are! The generation 2 legendaries are even more difficult to get, and they can't be purchased from the trading post.
---
As for GS builds, reaper, warrior and dragonhunter has some great options (maybe ranger too?).
---
True, there are some obscure structures from the dungeons, but they're not at all like the Exalted pillars. Plus even the Eye of the North (which is hinted to be god-made in the 2007 PCGamer magazine) was a rather iconic, and more importantly a one-of-a-kind, appearance.
---
Exalted didn't exist in GW1, they were created in GW2.
---
These small details tell us about quality of  the game.
---
And I heard that necromancers can talk to ghosts.
---
Depends on what content you are most interested in. For open world PvE, greatsword + axe/warhorn reaper is Superb if not #1. But greatsword is used in so many viable builds. For example power ranger, power guardian, power warrior and power mesmer.
---
&gt; 'Queer' has been increasingly reclaimed over the last decade as an alternative umbrella term.
---
I am curious of the average age of people who use it now / identify as such. I was beat up daily in school with that word thrown in my face in a hateful way, which admittedly colors my perception against it.
---
I'm also not coming from a place like "you must change this". I am just curious as to the thought processes behind it, is all.
---
&gt; Probably, but more importantly is that if we are in disagreement on that, then you've chosen an incorrect position.
---
Have a good one.
---
These things were also present in gw1.
---
It's Steve's cousin.
---
If you're worried about the Vabbi meta, you don't need a huge PvE guild at all. There used to be some bi-weekly runs organised within the GW2 community to be able to clear it easily. These runs had stopped since Anet made that meta much easier, but they will start again this week, Saturday at 4:30pm UTC.  
---

---
This is on EU servers, but I'm sure this could be organised on NA servers too (if it's not already the case).
---
This, as well as organised Triple Trouble kills etc., is something I really like about the GW2 community ! People helping out each other in content that might seem a bit more "niche" \^\^
---
Probably depends on who she's talking to.
---
Yeah, about what I expected.
---
I used to play a mesmer only, so think I'd like to try and switch it up. I'll look more into Reaper, thanks!
---
Mostly open world and PvE, yes.
---
Then the game has failed to communicate that to players.
---
I had many of the same experiences. It's a very cliquey game too. If you are new and don't have experience vets shit on you and kick or leave.
---
All gen one legendaries are a joke to make if buy the precursor. Only real constraints are map completion and gift of battle
---
It mostly depends on how attached you are to experiencing story &amp; lore. However, my personal opinion is that you can find out about that specific story in other ways. I like playing story stuff, but I really did not enjoy Living World Season 2.  
---
Living World 3 &amp; Living World 4 were WAY better, they all come with 6 new maps (1 per episode) and a lot of useful stuff. Living World 2 doesn't add anything apart from story &amp; some achievements (for which you often need to go through a lot of dialog and cutscenes before doing the achievement), and it's pretty boring.
---
So like I said: it depends on personal preference, but imo this isn't really worth it and other living world seasons are superior by far.
---
Plenty more room. I have come up with many elite spec ideas on this forum over the years.

Yeah I was sitting on possibly buying some gem store stuff soon but the build templates are so bad I'm going completely spendless. I hope there weren't too many whales that jumped at spending $300+ to maximize one of each class.

I'm... not gay anymore, so I can't be the gayest charr anymore. Turns out I'm asexual.

And I was stressing myself out from saying stupid shit and getting counter-flamed. Most of it I brought on myself. Deserved.

I care a lot about this game, but I don't have the time or energy anymore to wage an incredibly outnumbered war over things that *really* don't matter.
---
I'm doing more productive things in real life. I'm a junior in college now, I'm learning a second language, I'm a digital artist. I don't have the free time to argue on reddit anymore, and I don't have the energy to care either.
---
I still play GW2, but most people don't want me to be here in the subreddit. My open world builds "contribution" mostly just attracted drama and divided people. I wanted it to divide people in some ways. I wanted to feel like at least some people played the game like I did. But people here hate players like me anyway, even without me being a fuckwad.
---
So this'll probably be the last thing I say. Nobody asked anyway, and most people don't want it or don't care, but there you have it.
---
Serpents ire is still a huge pain in the ass. It has an incredibly long run up finding the champions, and it's almost impossible to coordinate that part. The shield part is better but now so easy it doesn't feel rewarding... And the last boss is just a slog. Not to mention once he's low he goes invulnerable for a ridiculously long time... It's not hard it just feels terrible to play.
---
I feel like the search needs a good way to rule out areas that players have already checked. The shields should be harder to crack, but feel more significant when you do, and they should stay down long enough so that you don't need to coordinate perfectly to break them all at once.
---
The final boss should feel like less of a grind, or at least make it possible for good groups to reduce how long he's invulnerable
---
Bloodstone gliding have pretty good CC in 2 skill and very nice damage in 1

I don't mind the layout of the map. For me it was doing the hearts over and over again. Never looked back after finishing the collection and getting out.

Agree, destroying old maps is the stupidest idea ever. Look at kessex hills. Majority of players dont know wtf is this. As they didnt play LW1
---
Hey doomkid.

As stated by others, game is not dying. You are actively discouraging new players.

Just delete this thread, cheers.

My only gripe with build templates in addition to pricing is that the build template should stay preserved even if I swap a skill out on my skill bar
---
That actually looked pretty cool, may come back to check it out
---
omg its good to see someone with the brain in this thread. All these new map haters dont know wtf they are talking about. They want even less content in this game? Maybe just delete everything and lets all touch each other in well populated Lions Arch?.. They are making me so angry man... :( They want to take the last thing that is keeping me in this game away because no good reason...
---
this is an mmo (I hope?) I want it to expand , I want big world I can explore, fuck the new map haters
---
Maps are dead mostly because there are no meta events or these events are not rewarding, just like PoF metas not long ago. Since Anet upgraded the rewards from events like Forged In Fire, people started doing them. It's not about amount of maps.
---
and lots of people love that we are getting another part of world to explore regulary. Stop destroying our game . Its not like if they stop making new maps they will suddenly add raids and dungeons... So stop with this new map hate!
---
Gold to gems does exist you know. You’re point was that you can’t get them by just playing the game but you can though. Farm up gold and then covert it to either a skin you want or try your luck with the 400 gem pack. People actually complaining about Anet making money of cosmetic only skins that have 0 impact on actual gameplay are acting kinda entitled tbh. Most of the default weapon skins look kinda garbage as well but you gonna complain about black lion skins or legendaries as well now? If you put in the time then it is earn able in game.
---
Agreed. Without that it’s not a template.
---
Expansion level content swoooooping in
---
GW2 makes less than Aion..
---
&gt; When I tried to raise the same concern I was heavily downvoted
---
No. You somehow expected a company, after screwing up something they've worked on for months, to communicate a solution after a week. Not realistic in gaming or any corporate setting.
---
If you want to be worried there are things far worse than not getting a response from Anet on this topic in a week or two.
---
LSW1 was dynamic Scarlet Invasions, 2 TT/Teq quality worldbosses/meta events with the Attack on the Breachmaker and Marrionette, a huge ass meta event in the Karka Invasion and Battle of Southsun(though easy). 
---
Patches every 2 weeks adding on to maps, constantly making them active, not just incredibly active for a week or two, but for multiple months.
---
Unique rewards, skins, tonics. Imagine if it came out today, it'd be the perfect place to put watchwork mount skins (although they'd probably still put it in the gemstore).

Nostalgia glasses? It was just good.

Long as I can still fall back to GW1 until they get their shit together. Game has too much microtransactions. I've found myself wishing I could buy more stuff but to me its not useful and the whole economy is dependent on the gem &gt; gold buying. Its always more time effective to buy gold than farm for that one item.
---
Ist
---
It may be useful to know when you last played
---
Guard, Power Chrono, Reaper. 
---
Since GS is not that good on Warrior (pve) i would only suggest the ones above.
---
Yes it is. Technically the Forgotten constructed Tarir's foundations rather than the Forgotten. But it wouldn't really fix any timeline issues since the issue for Kesho is "it wasn't in the first game".
---
I *hated* Jahai Bluffs when I first got there. It felt clunky and there is both a literal and gameplay rift between the top and the bottom parts of the map, like the bounties board in the south east corner - at first glance, it's just sort of there. 
---
The elegy and requiem collections actually made me like it more. It's like Bloodstone Fen (which is the least fen-like fen in the history of fens) in that most of the good stuff is found by zooming in and focusing on small areas at a time. 
---
I know what you mean about Thunderhead Peaks. I *want* to like it as a map; there's something that feels unique about it. It is, however, one of the most unoptimised and unintuitive maps in the game. Aside from the meta staging grounds, the rest of it just feels like disjointed filler and dead ends.
---
This^^    
---
Just wanted to add that if you don't have Runecrafter's Salvage-o-Matic you should probably ID + vendor Greens    
---
Also, personal opinion TLDR:    
---
Identify everything and salvage:
---
* __Blues:__ Copper-Fed
---
* __Greens:__ Runecrafter's (or sell to vendor)
---
* __Yellows:__ Mystic Kit/Silver-Fed (or Runecrafter's)(used to be worse, some change was made to tables/droprate that should have improved it but I haven't seen any research on that yet)
---
* Note: Rare greatswords are usually worth TP-ing, Exotics too if &gt;50-60s (not sure on this, ballpark figure). If there's a good superior rune/sigil that you can use perhaps salvage with BLSK
---
will i miss the prologue if i jump into episode 1?
---
&gt; are still super huge endeavors to get?
---
Well, they are legendary weapons and are still the top tier and last gear you will ever need so they will take time. Still, with the release of Living World maps and crafting material shipments you can trade-in for some gold and unbound or volatile magic it is probably way easier to get materials you need for crafting.
---
&gt; What's a great build/class that uses them most often?
---
That depends on the content you play but there are many professions who can use the greatsword.
---
In the Current Raid meta the following Professions/Elite specs use a greatsword, taken from the snowcrows Raid builds [here](https://snowcrows.com/raids/)
---
* Power Reaper
---
* Power Soulbeast
---
* Power Dragonhunter
---
* Power Quickness Firebrand
---
For Fractals, you have the following, taken from DT [here](https://discretize.eu/builds)
---
* Hybrid Firebrand
---
No new norn hairstyles though?!
---
Yes, but I don't have that "WEW A NEW MAP HOLY SHIT"-feeling anymore, it's just "well ok let's see what the vendors sell, ah nothing interesting bye" after completing the map
---
Yes, it is sad that somtimes people don't use the lfg system or if the map would be almost full they wouldn't mind not posting.
---
I finished the Henge a few weeks ago, and just posted a LFG on a Saturday and got 5-6 people working 5 minutes. Plenty of people still want Aurora, so try again at a busier time.
---
Myself and another whale left more than a year ago. We’re constantly joking about how terrible anet is at development and comparing other dev to the stinking pile anet is. 
---
I’m still here on reddit because I care about gw and my love for gw1 desperately wants gw2 to be good and entice me back but that looks to be a fading dream.
---
What?! Roller beetle racing is a thing. They added like 6 tracks to old maps and created events for completing races and time trials on them.
---
What do you guys do in gw2? I do raids in monday and CMs+T4 daily and have nothing Else to do.
---
I played through the entire LS1 and this is honestly what I remember most lol. Signposts and lots and lots lf ressing npcs in LA. 
---
Marionette fight was good, but we've had a lot of new metas and world bosses added since then.
---
Looks like I need to get some mastery points. I leveled my skyscale and left the others still level one haha
---
I mean if it took you 3 matches...:|
---
Nope, if u think game cant find their nick after they are reported, u are sooooo wrong.. game finds them by display name, griefers cant do a shit... Just lower then to 250... 800 is stupid
---
Can easily make a leg in 1-2 weeks. &lt;1 week if you’re committed
---
Acquiring legendaries is still the same process (if you craft legendary precursors), but there are many more ways to acquire the materials and the costs have gone down. I'd recommend buying ALL precursor collection Vol. 1s, just for fun.
---
Haha you made my day :)
---
Didn't even realize there was legendary armor, was mostly curious about weapons. Noted!
---
Tron in polish means throne so it would be Joko('s) Throne for me. Now I want it.
---
Whats the average ticket response time? My friend sent a ticket like 6 days ago to recover his account and still nothing. He got the automated messago tho, but almost a week is a bit too much imo
---
Hey don't apologize for having an opinion. I more or less agree with you, even. I just gave up on them having a polished system because the game isn't really about polish anymore (if it ever was?). I find it fun enough to keep playing, for now, but the whole thing dented my enthusiasm pretty hard.
---
This too. But I mean... it's really overused. Commander this, commander that, commander, commander, commander. Obviously they can't use PC's name in voice acting but some replacement word from time to time would be welcome.
---
E/Me was my first character made in GW1 and my main in post.
---
I don't think the reddit stats is a problem exactly. I think it is quite clear that Wow, ESO, FFXIV, BDO, and maybe even runescape are ahead as afar as population goes. GW2 is still a popular game and should be easily top ten in terms of population. 
---
Also GW2 is a slightly different game to other games. With games that have more vertical progression I think there is a bigger engagement per community member on forums and reddit. I suspect GW2 has more super casual open world players that just don't engage as much as a game that takes more effort to progress.
---
GW2 maybe struggling a little, but I am not sure you can take community engagement as a definite indicator.
---
Actually the moderated those threads heavily: the deleted half my posts with comparison between arc templates and theyr loadouts
---
Yeah that thing with legy weapons triggers me so hard
---
As a developer I would be unable to do such a deep change in this timeframe. Do you know what doesn't take 2 weeks tho' ? Communication. "we are aware there are issues and complaints about it, we're discussing it and will provide an answer to those concern next week".
---
But that's definitely not the strongest point of ANet.
---
Well, kinda makes it obvious why you didn't like SR, if you prefer trippleswamp or swamp+boss+x combo.
---
Elona EU lag is really bad. I lead a bounty train in vabbi two weeks ago and at some point people couldn't cast anything or attack or dodge, we'd get a lag spike and 20 people dead. It was becoming impossible with the scaling of bounties I just ended the train early.
---
So your argument is that you want rewards tied to specific content. Because then you are more free to play new content for those rewards? Except when they are tied to old content.
---
Seriously, that makes no sense whatsoever. You can play new content for most rewards. Just play the map. The current system offers way more freedom in that way then your porposed solution. You are argueing for something that goes directly against what you claim to want.
---
Sure you are.
---
I don't have any
---
http://old.discretize.eu/

https://snowcrows.com/gearoptimizer/
---
or you can be a normal person and use one of these two tools
---
bah, such a wall is no obstacle for my skyscale..... wait, what? an invisible barrier?
---
Since when is legendary PvP/WvW tendrils “less fancy” armor haha. (You just legendary the wrong set!)
---
Love love love when my tendrils battle animation spring forth!
---
And I happen to think it’s pretty fancy indeed good sir.
---
But yes I agree if you pvp or WvW regularly and enjoy the format they are both pretty easy ways to get some legendary pieces (keep in mind each piece is legendary gear is like 500g in additional mats and stuff as well... it’s not just free lol)
---
But it is.. (for lack of a better word) pimpin’ and to me.. quite fancy too
---
&gt; Nowadays representation is a necessary thing
---
In a fantasy land with reality-warping magic and sapient AI? *Really?* As far as I'm aware there are no in-game sources on inter"species" breeding or whether mesmers actually *feel* anything when they use their powers for masturbation, what the stances are on romantic involvements with ghosts, spirits and undead not to mention all the mundane non-controversial stuff like what everyday life as a normal citizen actually looks like.
---
Sure more lore usually is a good thing but why shoehorn in "representation" where it simply does not matter? The one point where it does stand out would be an entire species all denoted as male in-game but that can easily be handwaved as the females all being extremely shy and non-threatening.
---
Am spawn of Satan, can confirm, товарищ!  
---
But yeah, no, I don't get why most other languages are supported while ours isn't. Making a russian translation of the game at this point is extremely whatever as it'll go unnoticed (7 years after launch, lol), but literally adding one font is surely not out of their reach.  
---
If they were to stop releasing build templates for obscene amount of gems and listen for once, that is.
---
There are Chines GW2 servers, I would not be surprised if Koreans just play on there instead. Not EVERY Korean likes the grind.
---
My first gw1 guild (beta and launch gvg guild [ZEN]) collapsed because the leader convinced the others that the grind was too much...he made a 2nd guild called “The Grind” in protest!
---
This is GW 1 at launch that let you make instant lvl 20 pvp toons and it was still too much of a grind for them
---
I think it's pretty obvious that they try to cut costs. Neither the trees nor the stones/rocks are new.
---
Bloodstone skills are hellafun, but the only maps you can reasonably use most of them on is Bloodstone Fen. On other maps you either can't activate them at all or can't get enough air to get a decent number of uses out of them before you land. 
---
There's really a large missed opportunity by not providing ways you could use those abilities on other maps, like maybe having Unbound Magic style nodes floating around and if you touch one you can use those abilities, or just isolated segments of the map where you can use them at will until you leave the area.
---
I didnt say I didnt line SR. I said i never set foot there. I have no opinions, I dont know what it's like
---
&gt; he had a mirror over his bed where he likely enjoyed the company of specific paramours/mistresses after Lady Beetlestone's untimely death.
---
Honestly I always assumed that mirror was there so he could see **himself**, regardless of whether there was a lady present at the time or not. The guy had giant floating stone ornaments of his own face!
---
Oh wow, can you say more words please?
---
But translating the game costs money and every update, every change in written text also requires translation across all languages. If it wasn’t completely viable they wouldn’t do it.
---
BTW, You’re the one arguing with yourself about Koreans not liking grindy games. I’ve never said that, but I would like to note that they also like competitive games - LoL, Starcraft, CSGO and there was Korean community back in GW1 that was famous for being good in PvP. I don’t really see Korean players in GW2 for example, but in GW1 they were very noticeable, because they often used Korean alphabet for their names and guild names.
---
Oh, I remember waiting for that fucker to show up. I think it was at least 7 hours over the course of 4 days while running the game in the background.
---
If you need him for the riddle achievement I recommend to park as many alts as you can near his spawn point. Kill him with one, then do the riddle, log to another character, do the riddle, repeat. This way you can complete the achievement within one run.
---
I'd like to be constructive and blurt out a long wordy opinion, but the developer and player point of views constantly clash and there's misunderstandings all the time. Feedback has slowly become irrelevant to big or small studios. That's what made me give up on this game. There's a mixed bag of the good and bad, yet problems in this market still continue to become worse and are seriously out of control.
---
I've only looked at Fo76 and my eyes burn. I think!-Polish matters---But YOU RIGHT that's questionable lol. Overall I share the same disappointments and more about how this new Anet have acted.
---
&gt; Still have nightmares of 30+ fully dead people begging to be rezzed when a WP is on a ~~90~~ 15 sec run.
---
Fixed for mounts.
---
Yeah, it's a bit of an extreme reduction, but my point is there's a lot of overlap. Nuhoch wallow and jackal portals? Bounce mushrooms and springers? It's all sort of just another obstacle with a different flavor of overcoming, and rollerbeetles breaking certain walls, and raven others, doesn't ring that weird to me as a result.
---
I'm sorry but I have to disagree here, the more maps there are, the better, in my opinion.
---
They already sold you the box, they dont neednto fix it.
---
Now buy these overly shiney sparkling outfits please.
---
Then every article of clothing, piece of furniture, item of food, etc I own is currency.
---
Every legendary weapon made = less artists working on gemstore skins.
---
It’s episode 1 not 2 😛
---
Well we wanted build templates, we got build templates.
---
Fixing up existing elements of the game hasn't been a thing since release, so... why would it happen now?
---
Should it not be episode 1?
---
Pretty much, Commander is still above Hero, Champion, and god forbid... Boss
---
Feels like The Grey Warden or Inquisitor from Dragon Age
---
To be fair it's not a **bad** concept. The idea of using mastery for exploration / motion / unlocking is good, better than giving us combat options from it.
---
And obviously, you'll run out of ideas if you want to use everything everywhere. So long as there's a difference in theme I can be fine with it.
---
What is weird is that they insisted on adding such broadly-applying options for the mounts, which understandably should be lasting mainstays of the game.
---
I think I see the problem. I believe the rune is supposed to say (1+): +10 power, instead it looks like it only applies if you have 1 of said rune equipped, and instead you gain only the might effect.
---
Don't forget profession-specific effects. For example on mesmer you want to hoard as many raw stat modifiers as possible because phantasms don't inherit percentage modifiers but you *can* give them perma fury very easily so your own fury uptime matters less especially if you time your burst. The calculations for Citadel and Strength will also shift a bit if you have traits interacting with those boons.
---
I don't know. We'll have to see how they get implemented. 
---
I mean, for one thing, the HoT ones are almost universally worse than the PoF ones, right? I mean, a Wallow is *mostly* the same as a portal, so that's just flavor, but a Mushroom is a Springer that you can't move anywhere, it just is where it is, mechanically speaking. So they had Mushrooms, and then added Springers, but what if they'd had Springers and added Mushrooms? Would anyone go "wow, that's a cool new ability." 
---
So these Raven doors seem likely to just be Beetle doors, only you can only use them near a Raven shrine maybe, or at least have to unlock a new mastery to get them. That just seems objectively worse for anyone who has a beetle. But not everyone does have a beetle either, so I could see the use in providing this *option,* and as a player who has both, you could use either you wanted. 
---
In the better Metroidvanias, each key upgrade is something unique and interesting, or at least most are. Later ones might make older ones obsolete, but they are not just "the same thing in a different flavor, they are at least equal *and* better. It's lame when an upgrade is just a different color of the thing you already had, or if you just get a "red key" to open one area, and then a "blue key" to open another. Those are lazy upgrades and should be avoided.
---
I'd rather skip farming the new maps for 250 currency if I don't know what I will get from it.
---
Depends on what you want to do. All around I’d say dp daredevil. Non cheese 1v1 core power sd. Roaming with style? PP daredevil. Deadeye is just abusing stealth and condi is abusing condi spam. I guess it’s fine if you lack shame.
---
Honestly many stories would be better with *less* relationship drama. Only the hero not being (allowed to be...) gay tends to be the only reason the team gets any females at all so good look getting *that* approved by the pro-representation side.
---
Would have been funny to see Palpatine's reaction when Anakin came out of the closet though XD
---
well, i just need to find him first xD me and some people have been w8ing for over 2 hours now, for his bounty to appear in different maps...
---
This only started a few weeks ago in anywhere but wvw
---
Why the sarcasm? do you think the devs pay cheques go up when you buy a skin they designed? Well they don’t,
---
Anet executives get the money, not the developers
---
Same thing been happening to me, too. Can't lead bounties or metas. People just die to things they can't dodge.
---
new maps are always exciting, this is why I dont agree with OP here
---
Nope.
---
The email was sent to my human necro called Raquel Bardy and I have a norn mesmer called Valkyria Ravenkin
---
and they are on new permanent maps, so adding maps are great. Of course less people will play them as time goes on, but at least there is an option to do that, unlike marionette..
---
It's not *currency,* it's an "item of value." I'm not exactly sure how they define the distinction between what is "currency" and what is not, however, since you could technically use any item as a token of barter.
---
They are cheaper than they used to be (gen1).
---
As for viable professions that use it, depends on content, for PvE the best choices are probably power dragonhunter and power Soulbeast, they will do well in organized instanced content like fractals and raids. You also have power reaper that technically will not perform as good but it's viable nonetheless and having a higher survability than normal is probably a good choice.
---
It’s not greed, it’s business, 
---
is it greedy to charge for food and service at a restaurant?
---
Greedy to ask for money when you provide a service?
---
Greedy to a youtuber to ask for subscribers/patrion 
---
Greedy to ask someone to pay for fuel to run their vehicle
---
Are you greedy to assume your boss will pay you to come in to work?
---
I cant this is the one thing that triggers me the most. Also peolpe who say we should not get new specializations because game is hard to balance.. what? maybe then remove all proffestions and just all play quaggan that have 1 autoattack skill that is easy to balance.. People are really stupid... this is an mmo, you need new maps, new skills, if you dont get them THE GAME IS DEAD
---
now thats a really unpopular opinion here.. As I remember very well that people shitted all over her when LW1 was active.
---
Nope. I have a Norn revenant with raven chosen in the biography named Raven in first name. The mail was addressed to my thief with snow leopard chosen without a trace of raven in the name :p
---
There is also a good reason why power berserker use thief runes.... At least I hope there is one xD
---
Pointsless since there is a lot of stuff to be taken into account.
---
What class are you playing? Dragonhunter gets 35% crit chance from traits alone, deadeye gets 12% etc.
---
How much agony resistance do you have? Obviously scales with the offensive potion to provide precision.
---
Do you have spotter or not? Roughly 4.76% difference.
---
Etc.
---
Just use the snowcrows gear optimizer since its literally what its made for
---
&gt; a lot of people don't want relationships in the story. That was the complaints I saw most anyway, which saddens me a bit. :)
---
As one of "those" it's not really plain "relationships" in general but "relationship drama". If the villain must capture someone as a damsel I don't really care whether the hero is in *loOove* or has a deep friendship or the two are literal siblings and the issues with the damsel trope apply to all of them. But those stupid, forced, zero buildup, poorly resolved love triangles shoved into any big screen production just steal runtime away from the actual story I'm supposed to be interested in.
---
Logan&amp;Rytlock and Caithe&amp;Faolain were pretty good within the context. Braham going off on us and we just standing there like he's the angry girlfriend who found a picture of an ex on our phone was *terrible* even though there really is no room for romantic subtext with the PC I play (female sylvari).
---
To a large degree it tends to be a matter of "conservation of detail" or limited resources: relationships, sexuality and pretty much everything else which falls under "representation" nowadays are only included if the authors think they will factor into the story somehow. There is no in-universe reason to have black people in the giant CGI army so why spend time and money tuning models for them? We don't want to spend 6+ hours in the cinema or in a single story instance so we don't see any of the townsfolk coming home to their three trans-asuran lovers and having kinky BDSM sessions. So even in GW2 most relationship partners end up damseled, dead or worse because that is their only involvement in our story (RIP Belinda, I was astonished you survived the first deployment).
---
i hope you're trollling ...
---
This is how I get a lot of my metas done that can't be solo'd.
---
Get a commander tag.
---
Solo pre-events
---
Start soloing boss to the best of my ability
---
Others usually show up
---
One of the big reasons why they keep failing again and again.
---
Being offended by criticism doesn't invalidate it. If someone screams "your house is on fire you incompetent idiot" it won't become automatically false just because he's an asshole.
---
Looking ain't reading.
---
The episode isnt even out yet and you're complaining about the content already
---
What settings do you run? Everything is telegraphed nicely for me in Twilight Oassis. Amala is one of the best designed bosses in fractals. All those fast attacks are really fun to dodge/sidestep. Only lackluster part about the fight is the priestesses that you have to kill between phases.
---
I think it sends to the last character you logged in to.
---
right after swiss.
---
Well, I think the trick to it would be to restrict its use only to certain areas where it could be fun, but not too gamebreaking. I mean, most open world events are not "high pressure," the difference between "min-maxing it" and just casually attempting to clear it is only a few minutes time, so as long as these abilities are only available in areas away from the "high stakes" events, players could have fun messing with them while farming basic events, hearts, gathering, whatever it is they are mostly doing on that map, without *really* tipping the balance to any significant degree. 
---
I mean, they included some areas of Jahai and Dragonfall that had Jungle Masteries, and this wasn't some massive balance issue for those players that hadn't bothered unlocking them.
---
Oh, I have never had one of those.
---
Pretty much.  I think it's a safe bet to state that the usage statistics for build templates fall within ArenaNet's margin for error.  I think losing elements of the more hardcore/competitive playerbase is intentional because it'll allow them to focus casual, open-world story-focused PvE, meta-events and Strike Missions.  That_Shaman apparently data_mined some challenges more the strike missions, I don't think that'll placate players that feel slighted.
---
^ This. My weekly keyfarm character got a mail recently.
---
There was bugged dynamic event in the middle of Snowden Drifts that it took Anet 4 years to fix.
---
I don't think you understand how coding works.
---
If the filter list doesn't have any words in it that use unsupported chat codes. even the highest filter setting would not work.
---
Me being casual who didn't start raids yet: Who the heck is Glenna?
---
The problem was not the health requirement, but that at that time, they were extremely expensive compared to the price of other utilities, close to 2g I believe, so most players have written them off, in favour of sharpening stones at 1/40 of the cost.
---
Which is why build sites didn't even mention them. But then a linked benchmark video turned out to be using a writ, achieving a benchmark unreachable with the standard build given in the guide.
---
Well, what processor/CPU are you running alongside it?
---
What it does do is use unsupported chat codes. which is exploiting of the chat system. The issue isn't what people can't see. Its what they could see through exploitation of the chat. Which would be a way to circumvent the filters designed to protect against such behavior.

---
What a hilariously arrogant comparison. Yes, *the house is on fire,* but only some of you brave Redditors can point that out to the blind developers and all of us dumb normies!
---
No, most GW2 criticism we see is of inherently subjective things. *"This is too expensive!"*, "there's too much/not enough ____", "I don't like this character", etc. (All of which is fair and worthwhile to argue, just to be clear.) And in that situation presenting your argument in a pointlessly offensive, whining manner absolutely weakens and makes it easy to ignore. Silly pettiness is a big flashing warning sign (almost like a house on fire) that the critic is—speaking generously—being overly emotional.
---
There's a difference between can't and won't, just like there's a difference between an obligation and commitment...learn it, and while at it, realize how self-entitled you are.

Maybe if we use more smiley faces it'll convince Anet to give us a new character select screen

There is some supporting info for that tho..

Kormir mentions thay Lyssa was reluctant at first when removing Balthazar's power and we dont know why. He was using her mirror for the whole Lazarus stunt and... when he dies, Lyssa is the only one he doesnt curse.
---
&gt; IRS uses the term “virtual currency” in these FAQs to describe the various types of convertible virtual currency
---
Gems are not convertible virtual currency.
---
I think they do care, the developers themselves at least its just not within their ability to demand the time to go back and fix things whenever they feel like it and most of the managers are likely and kind of rightfully more focused on the next content we are getting and hitting deadlines for that.
---
Love how people assume everything would be fixed in five minutes if those darn lazy developers would just look at the problem we found! They probably know, have known and want to fix it more than you could know but they are an employee and can't go off doing their own shit whenever they feel like
---
ANet as a whole cares about keeping the game going and pushing content for people to play now, yes there isn't enough attention given to older issues but given the circumstances, number of staff and what we know about how they are grouped and managed, I would never say its neglegence.
---
Very nice cheatsheet for minmaxers!
---
For power gear, I always have used scholar runes and full berserker in all content. Don't really care capping 100%, around 80%+ (with fury) in raid/fractal content has been good enough so far. In other content 50%+ is good enough (actually 70% with fury).
---
All of my power characters use full berserker with scholar runes (even when pieces of assassin or different runes are recommended). It is just simpler that way and easy to remember. Sometimes hits don't crit, but raid bosses die anyway, so never mind, it's a successful kill. Anyway, I mostly play professions what naturally have almost 100% crit from traits.
---
If PvE is your thing and you enjoyed dual pistol thief then this may he of interest https://youtu.be/ws-PikNBi-o

Deadeye elite spec requires PoF expansion however

I put my bets on getting a fractal before christmas but unrelated. It would be a great move imo.

&lt;insert prequel sand meme&gt;
---
that would be an Intel Core i5-2400. Rather old, but works fine so far.
---
Hah, until you mentioned this here, I completely had forgotten this map. Guess I can play it a little more, maybe even explore it 100% and do some events. I only did the story part when it was released. Thank you for reminding.
---
I kindof agree that in an environment where stuff is broken, cutscene scripting can go out the door in exchange for bugfixing and replaced with standard dialogue. Just remember though that the art/graphics team (even if they do have implementation programmers) has time for (ITT:  Cosmetics) and cutscenes, does not mean that the company is structured for fixing events, and if the company structure is focused, they shouldn't be. QA? Fuck yeah, complain about that for sure.

I really would have loved them during the Wyvern fight in Siren's Landing; the one where you have to glide through most of it. That's a REALLY fun boss imo and would have really benefited from the Bloodstone abilities and kinda makes me want more battles that utilize gliding.  
---
Even if the terrain isn't fit for Gliding, all you really need to do is add Updrafts and voila! People can now use the Gliding combat.

Explanation : NC West Holdings maid a paid-in capital increase and NCSoft is buying 132B KRW worth of share. Thus, NCSoff made an interesting investment for NC West. Is this going to be a new mobile game project? Who will know?
---
And What about armor? Maybe valkyrie?
---
At first sight I thought he was a reskinned godforged shaman, since those have shoulder spikes too, but his face was never used for flame legion before, and his horns are completely new.
---
Funny thing is, I remember seeing other charr with large secondary horns like those before, but I can't remember where. I may have been artwork.
---
Around 105kk USD.
---
Yeah, i used it sometimes but i Can't kill targets quickly
---
Maybe wrong armor stats?
---
No, you dont understand the issue. Its not about what people can't see. its about what using this exploit, and i'm referring to both the app and the code in chat it uses, could mean for players who like to avoid things like chat-sensors or blocked words. And its that that complicated for ill willing people to assign english letters to these un-supported codes either. Allowing to things like selling of accounts, gold ect. all circumventing the systems in place to keep that from happening. You're still thinking off "offensive" language as curse words. i'm talking about death threats, nazi talk, organisation of terrorist attacks. And No i'm NOT saying that the app creator is intending any of that. I genuinely believe he wants to help russian players. But that has to be done by A-net. not through an app that ill willing people could hijack to do truly evil things.
---
This is a case of "just because you can, doesn't mean you should." And i'm really worried that this would end up becoming the tool some evil person manages to kill people with.
---
About $112.7m investment
---
&gt; I was beat up daily in school with that word thrown in my face in a hateful way, which admittedly colors my perception against it.
---
I see, I'm sorry about that :(
---
As far as I see, it's mostly younger generations who reclaim it.
---
I poked around the net a bit, and found a UK research from [2018](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-lgbt-survey-summary-report).
---
&gt; Respondents in younger age groups were much more likely than those in older age groups to identify as bisexual, asexual, pansexual, queer or ‘other’. 
---
I found an age breakdown of identities in Annex 3.
---
| Age | Percentage among those who picked 'queer' |
---
| --- | --- |
---
| 16-17 | 8.5%
---
| 18-24 | 42.4%
---
| 25-34 | 35.4%
---
| 35-44 |  8.3%
---
| 45-54 |  4.6%
---
| 55-64 |  0.8%
---
| 65-74 | 0.1%
---
| 75+ | -
---
But I can't find it the other way around, ie. what proportion of X-age respondents identify as such. (And here it's only used as an identity label, not an umbrella term.)
---
Edit: There was a [2018 USA survey](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/shannonkeating/half-of-all-lgbtq-people-identify-as-bisexual-or-queer) that shows similar proportions.
---
Yes, it's getting close. 
---
How fast? Nobody knows. Probably not even ANet.
---
left
---
My guess is that the huge walking version is not in fact a strike, but an open world event. If you look closely you can see players running around its feet, and the chains attached to it do not appear to be part of the model but instead look a lot like those chains you attach to "runaway" mobs in events in Crystal Oasis or Thunderhead Peaks.
---
Well, it does seem that Anet is a VERY small company and running an exceptionally large project.
---
Why would you get triggered by this, these POI locked behind episode related stuff are very nice. It matters only for your first map completion in this case, until you get over said hurdle. Then it will be like any other map completion.
---
&gt; You’re the one arguing with yourself about Koreans not liking grindy games. I’ve never said that
---
Why are you even talking to me then?
---
Hello,
---
Sorry to brin this back again, my understanding is that the different buil colums :
---
\- When they're empty an you click on them the build is saved.
---
\- When you click on them back again it loads the build.
---
\- I'm really scared each time to not see all my items in my bags (ok the workaround is just to select parts of the gear from equipment, and move it to the account bank for example).
---
Now i'd really like to remove all the templates i have saved, is there any way ?
---
thanks

And yet it comes out after the hyperbole and lies that most of the people claiming false bans were actually banneddl for legitimate reason but chose to stur shit out of spite, that's happened at least two times in the last year and a bit to my recollection.
---
People spout nonsense and get taken seriously because it fits a narrative people like and want to push so regardless of evidence they just go ahead and decry the company.
---
If you are not having any luck with the meta, you could do some WvW or sPvP and do the Heart of Maguuma reward track. The final chest lets you choose any armor piece you want https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mordremoth_Cache
---
The thing is, is I don’t know much about euros or the metric system and I don’t pretend to, but the guy I commented on was correcting a mistake about the amount of money in USD so I assumed they knew what they were talking about.
---
It's simpler for elite specs, tbh.  
---
Reaper: PDPS  
---
Scourge: CDPS/Support  
---
Next one: Scrapper-esque bruiser-tank with utility (hinted at by DM rework), probably sword   
---
Berserker: CDPS/PDPS  
---
SPB: Bruiser-tank with utility   
---
Next one: Support (Hinted at by Tactics now having actual heals). Weapon - idk, pistol mb. Or "martial" staff or w/e.   
---
Chrono: ... support?.. I have no idea what Chrono is anymore, and I mained it.  
---
Mirage: CDPS  
---
Next one: PDPS, possibly 2 daggers. (Hopefully), or mainhand pistol seeing as mesmer has no dedicated 1 hand power option. Chrono will probably get Danger Time reworked.   
---
DH: PDPS  
---
FB: Support/CDPS  
---
Next one: Something tanky. Probably going to get a weird offhand or daggers.  
---
Etc. Pattern's pretty evident, though don't quote me on potential weapon choices.
---
Sorry then i actually have no idea , i mean you're getting a higher discount sooo maybe just grab it while you can ? xD
---
I replied to someone else asking about the armor boxes earlier so I will just copypaste:
---
How is the snowcrows gear optimizer toxic? It just calculates precision for you...
---
Lore states that it was built above ground but sunk when Joko dammed the Elon creating those quicksand.
---
As for it being an issue - no really because as said, maps stuck in time. Kesho just needs to have been built post-Prophecies to work in the timeline.
---
NCSOFT West is mostly producing from mobile market so I think is a mobile game. Aion is not that alive anymore. Blade &amp; Soul is p2w but, at this point, brings more revenue than GW2.
---
There are more new screenshots, including one of **[a new backpack](https://www.buffed.de/Guild-Wars-2-Spiel-17072/News/Gefluester-im-Dunkeln-1336906/galerie/3329210/?fullsize)**. Looks like the head of the Boneskinner.
---
It's from the[ German site 'buffed.de'](https://www.buffed.de/Guild-Wars-2-Spiel-17072/News/Gefluester-im-Dunkeln-1336906/).
---
Also it's walking around outside, while the strike mission seems to take place in some arena. Hard to say though. Maybe the final phase of the fight is him just hopping up and trying to get a mountain top to cause an avalanche or something.
---
It is the same model in different phases: [that_shaman](https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/1194330864286437376) (spoiler)
---
Based on some UI art that\_shaman dug up and posted on his twitter a few weeks ago, it'll be new set of mastery points and not PoF/S4 mastery points.
---
I will. Already saved thousands on games alone by not supporting anti consumer degenerates. Since they don't owe me quality I don't owe them money. Easy life.
---
I like strikes and I really hope Anet will take a break from the raids. I did all wings, got my armor set, completed the ring collections then took a break for 2 months. When I came back (last week) the LFG for Raids was almost empty....2 selling tabs, 1 training groups and some pugs who were doing Vale. Another problem is the fact that raids were ruined by ignoring the main problems (fake elitism, unbalanced classes, meta). For a casual game like GW2, those problems were out of the league and raids quickly became just a way for some players to get rich. I know a guy who came from WoW with a part of his raiding guild and is selling raids on GW2. He doesn't care about story, he even believed that Aurene is a boy dragon and he got shitty AP.....but they sell tons of raids and they are richer than a good percent of GW2 veterans. He has his bank full of around 20 stacks of MC, tons of ecto and gold......it was crushing, raid selling was one of the knives that killed this game mode. Elitism should be present only in WvW and PvP where it makes sense to be. The wings themselves and the raid bosses were really enjoyable, I liked every one of them, this was not a problem. The problem was waiting 30-40 minutes for a certain class on LFG...why? Because only that class made sense for that boss. This is 50% Anets fault and 50% players fault (because they can't think "outside the meta"). I also enjoy the possibility to just join  a strike and be autogrouped with ppl. They should just focus on 10 players strikes that have 2-3 bosses with some fun mechanics and that's it!
---
Because the most players enjoy other contents that raid. Would you sacrifice your game just to make 1/5 of players happy? They focus to create content for everyone, they realized how the raids fucked up the community pretty hard.
---
Yussssssss.
---
As long as you log in during an episodes release period, you get it for free. If you never logged in while the prologue was out and you log in on the day episode 1 is already live, then yes, you will miss the prologue. So log in sometime before next Tuesday!
---
I got The Witcher vibes.
---
If it's just story, you can do it within a few days.
---
I've been seeing "this game is dead" since 2013.
---
Huh, good to know, thanks for the tip!
---
Marauder armor and the rest berserker. If you need more defensive stats as a thief, you already lost.
---
Um... so I guess using real terms for lands is off the book because god knows everyone and their mother uses them to name their territories.
---
I guess we can cross out fjord, boreal, tundra, peaks... what else...
---
yeah, I plan to buy it ASAP :D
---
Personally? Do a run through Bitterfrost Frontier for berries, go to dragonfall for the meta (and farm keys if I'm running low), wait for my friend to log in to see if he wants to do fractals or raids (monday, tuesday), do something if he wants to, log off and read a book or do chores around the house or get ready for bed.
---
&gt; There is no secured income anymore
---
That's a hefty, uninformed, assumption.
---
I'd say so, yes. In recent months, the game has felt more alive to me than it has in years.
---
How many times have you actually been sent nudes and boobs?
---
This honestly doesn't give me confidence , having played NCsoft games this just means to me that they'll start going on the Ncsoft style of monetizations  and shop and it's awfull .
---
Are there any overlays for macOS?
---
I will tell you why I THINK raids made gw2 toxic. First of all, the wings and bosses were fun and decent, I enjoyed all of them so the content itself was not the problem. Before raids, community was pretty casual and relaxed...follow a tag, stack and nuke, break a cc bar and nuke, dodge a slow big red circle etc. Nothing too complicated. Then the raids arrived. The first mistake was to announce that raids will reward the legendary armor. They should have wait 1-2 months and let players enjoy the mode first. When they said the reward, players focus from "have fun in the new content" to "I have to get that armor!". This greed pushed the players to achieve success through any means necessary. They started developing builds, analyze classes and soon they felt into another extreme (meta). Yes, most players got fixed in some meta published by 1-2 guilds and were never able to think outside the meta. GW2 never had balanced classes so creating a meta around 2-3 classes was not too hard. As I said, a lot of people, especially on LFG and even the guilds recruiting, are not even now able to think outside the meta. If you take a look at the current metas, you will see 2-3 classes that are very relevant and desired.....others are just there, for one trait or one boon. Another problem that completely angered the community was the apparition of raid sellers. We have players that do nothing else than raids and are 100 times richer than a GW2 veteran. Anet should have act in the beginning and punish raid selling trough any means. We have players who are stacked on 50 stacks of Mystic Coins while 90% strugle to gather 250 to craft a legendary. I know raid sellers who are stacked on gold, ectos and MC and have no reason to sell them, so they impact the price of these materials. The raids themselves were never a problem, the way Anet introduced and managed them was a problem.
---
Guild Wars 3 is on the horizon (really doubt it but hey ).
---
I swap everything personally. It's not too hard to remember to adjust decimals and date format.
---
I use a destructor shortbow with orange infusion and a dreamthistle shortbow with teal infusion to change skin during my rotation
---
&gt; With that said, I do hope to have Sylvari make some mention of it either way because of how big a story point it was before.
---
Well they did make a point of it during All or Nothing when you encounter Sylvari Awakened, and if you're a Sylvari you have different dialogue than any other race.
---
&gt; We need more than just another Sandswept Isles to build the momentum. (That episode had an epic trailer too but really didn't deliver on it IMO)
---
I was just thinking the same. The Sandswapt Isles trailer was godly. But the actual theme in-game wasn't anywhere near as dark or horror.
---
Weird...
---
Yes, it was, ANet and NCSoft heard your concerns, carefully considered them, and said, "Fuck you, buy Gems."
---
Not just EVE tbh, it's often used. I like to think of it as of "kilo-thousands" personally.
---
Well NCSoft West doesn't just run GW2 but I predict most of this will be going to GW2 and Anet maybe to let Anet hire a new team for a new project but if this is for GW2 or at least part of it that could mean NCSoft has definitely told Anet to focus on this game. Some will be going to Aion in North America because gameforge runs the European version and Lineage as well as Blade and Soul.
---
Glenna is best girl. Change my mind
---
I think most will go to GW2 and Lineage because GW2 is their only Western made game. Blade and Soul is their most successful in house game i.e. NCSoft developed game.
---
And me, a 6 years old GW2 veteran just left Destiny 2 (after 3 months) to come back to GW2. I decided I will stay here forever. Even if it dies, I will stay until the second 0. I will not disconnect myself, I will make them disconnect me! Even if it goes maintenance with no new content, I will stay and enjoy what I have! I will gather apples in Quuensdale, I will play hide and seek with the kids, I will jump in the moshpit to the best metal concert Tyria ever had and I will ride my skimmer until I will be teleported back for leaving the map! I love this game. Maybe the guy that left loved it too, but when you are an employee, you have other priorities. Maybe he will keep playing GW2 and one day we will wipe at Vale like some noobs and he will tell me "I have designed this shit and now he's killing me"
---
Look at the guild recruitment subreddit - r/guildrecruitment/
---
Maps are crowded most of the time
---
Oh you mean "tons"? I see what you did there..
---
UNLIMITED POWER!!!!
---
That's the special upgraded armor for the colossus, which can be bought on the gem store but is not earnable in-game.
---
Yep, patches with either new content, or yearly festivals happen pretty much every month. On top of this, there are often community events, and plenty of people to play with. If you've been away for a while, Living world+expansions could keep you busy for a very very long time too.
---
I just left Destiny 2 to return to GW2 but don't get me wrong, Destiny 2 is a jewel of a game. I enjoyed it and I enjoyed the raids too. They are very funny. Being a shooter is not very class or build based, is more like doing the mechanics good enough. What I did not like about Destiny is that I have to use my phone to find groups (the game does not have LFG or any global or local chat, you have to use their mobile app)
---
Yes for both qustions.
---
It's a loadout, not a template.
---
Thank you for making my point even clearer! This is exactly what I tried to convey. Queer people just exist, just as hetero people just exist. :)
---
Thnx
---
Thank you. I still bear deep scars from the wars that were but I still look forward for the wars to come. We made Tyria a better place, all of us. Every blade, every spell, every bullet or arrow counted toward our goal. We lost people, we won new friends. We died and we came back. Now we are celebrating, but another enemy is drawing close. They will not take what is ours!
---
OK you made clear what you point is, now allow me to tell you why you are wrong.
---
Before raids (basically means before HoT) there was no breakbar. It was defiance stacks and they were by far more punishing if you did the wrong cc at a time. Also a meta was well established before HoT aka. raids came out. 
---
The meta shifted a bit with raids got adjusted to 10 man and condi builds came into play, but that was it.
---
Also every player which is somewhat more than just casually into raiding, should know his classes well enough to think situational. 
---
To your point with legendary armor. there was absolutely no rush at all for it, since it was avaliable after wing 4 launched which was like 1.5 years after the first raid launched. So i don't know where you got that idea from. 
---
LFG can be rough sometimes, since you need some kp or LI and bad players are way more strict when it comes to meta classes than good ones.
---
A good raid lfg grp would never refuse let's say a holo or a reaper, if they just want to do a normal clear and the player on that "non meta " class carries his weight.
---
About raid selling. What is wrong with players that are more rich than others? we are living in capitalism, so why should it be different here. People who invest more into the game than others should have more gold simple as that. Also TP barons have waaay more money than raid seller. And you can probably earn the same amount of gold in open world just with a bit more time investment.
---
The only valid point i give you are the LI and KP restrictions, but in my opinion, you cannot expect experience people to carry everyone thru the content, while having less fun since this person might not be doing well.
---
So final note: i don't see any valid argument that raids made gw2 more toxic than it was before. (btw before raids the requirement for dungeons was AP, which wasn't even better )
---
GW franchise has always been ncsoft game.
---
YES!
---
Lol I asked a simple question and i got downvoted. Well thanks guys for replying will be giving it a try.
---
I would like a code! I have been playing GW2 for 6 years. It is my favorite game and I doubt I will ever a play a mmorpg for so long ever again. If you still have a code, I would appreciate it. One is enough. If not, well, it is not really important. What is truly important is to stop the renegades from breaking the peace!
---
Read another way, this sounds a lot like "Let the ethnic cleansing begin!" Which didn't work out too well for the last major world power that tried it.
---
Mystic coins are used to trade basically everything outside of the trading post.
---
But maybe you should ask: Why do raid sellers want MC. Well it is because gold is not an option thanks to the gold sellers and the weekly cap anet introduced. Totally a raid sellers fault.
---
Of course they looked for another currency which is stable. And i know that raid sellers are also taking other stable materials as payment if you ask them (Amalgamated gemstones, Ectoplasm, Stabilizing Matrices).
---
Also i don't see why holing onto an item supports toxicity in any way.
---
And ye the dev who left was involved in wing 1-4 from what i know... but she also did big world bosses... does that mean we will not get world bosses anymore? doubt it.
---
I run everything on medium settings on linux, because I could probably use a better processor / memory. For the most part, I can see most of the attacked by Amala, but if you're in the open world with roughly 50-ish people attacking a champ / legendary, my system can't update fast enough to show every attack.
---
You don't even need to mentor up tbh, just make a tagless squad and post in the lfg.
---
No, but they said they would upgradd strike missions with new episodes.
---
Dodge.
---
Whats the giant bar after GW2?
---
3-4 times in what? 2 years.
---
Oh sweet summer child
---
Probably still GW2 launch since it launched in the last few days of Q3.
---
I don't understand the Siren's Reef hate , it's just teachs you that sometimes it's stupid to move to an Elite instead of just phasing the boss . If you can stick to her you never have any problems , especially with a good Alacren in the group (one that doesn't just mindlessly run Kalla+Shiro all the time). The problem is when you don't run a correct comp and expect it to be a smooth run .
---
That's very typical for reddit - people who downvote usually don't give any reasons behind that.
---
Oh, thank you for finding that info for me. It's really interesting to see. This younger generation seems a bit more open, both with taking people at face value and being a bit more fluid with their sexuality, and this chart sorta backs that up.
---
Even though I don't like that word, it does hearten me a bit that the younger generation doesn't seem to have been subjected to as much harassment as people from my generation.
---
That's actually why people think Siren's Reef is hard , is people move from the boss to the ads , the time you spend killing the elites is enough to finish off the boss and have less risk getting thrown off the platform wtf are you even saying . You never want to move to the ads , unless you can cleave them , if you do everything will go to shit .
---
Holy shit is that true?
---
Agreed, if you delete your characters you gonna lose all those nice [Birthday Gifts](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Birthday_Gift).
---
The wiki is a team effort, and this article was no exception. If anything, this article was even more of a collaboration than usual, because we're keenly aware of how sensitive this topic is. We discussed everything we added to it at length, and continue to do so in response to feedback.
---
I can assure you that being inflammatory is the exact opposite of our intention, and if you feel there are still problems with it, it would be very helpful if you could actually explain what they are. We can't fix a problem we don't understand.
---
Suck on Dessa nuts
---
I’m not your puppy! 
---
*whistle* ....... here Glenna!
---
Also, let's not forget that GW2 is still their golden goose here in the West, their other games did *"somewhat"* well here sure, but they were no where near as successful as GW2 was for the western audience, mainly because Eastern style games like Blade and Souls, Aion and Lineage are not too appealing for most of the western audience, these games are much, MUCH more successful in Korea, China and Japan since this is the audience they cater to the most.
---
I agree I wish this investment would have happened before the layoffs maybe that could have done something. But if investment means GW2 is helped I'll take it.
---
Yes, actually. Getting constant reports of people in metas telling me my tag is teleporting and they cant follow or, when killing stuff, times freezes for 5+sec then you can use your abilities again. The latter is the worst one because people keep dying to dodge-able stuff on bounties for ex.
---
it's not p2w but the fact that it is not p2w does not make it any less egregious.
---
Thx for Info
---
it isn't coming anytime soon (or ever) and the fact that you can't spin this in a positive light does not change that
---
Zojja\*
---
you lose every item that is on the character you delete, you keep everything else such as bank items, achievement points, titles, etc. anything in material storage will not be deleted. basically you just delete the character and any item that is stored on that character.
---
yes
---
At my job our priorities are to fix bugs first then add features.  Unless the bug affects very few users and/or has a very easy workaround we fix them first and new features come second.  We don't abandon old functions or features and, if we do, it gets deprecated over about 2-5 years (depending on popular it is).  We also make sure there is a substitute in place before completely removing it.  Finally, we have a drive for efficient, easy to understand and oftentimes modular code.  If we identify old code that is not up to current standards or we have a bloated code base that makes it difficult to add new features or fix bugs we spend time to update the code base to make future work easier and quicker.  This way of doing things is not at all unique to my current job but is, in general, good coding practice.
---
Anet clearly does not follow any of this.  Anything bugged in an old feature gets ignored for months or years, their engine is horribly unoptimized and inefficient, their code base is "spaghetti", their general quality of releases is poor at best and more.  Anet, in terms of software development, is awful.  There was a point at my current job where we focused more on features than fixing bugs and ignored existing bugs for a while until it got to the point where our product was just a giant, buggy complicated awful mess.  We pumped the brakes, spent about 2 years doing little to no new features and completely overhauled everything.  Now, we have much less bugs and release many new features.  Anet needs to fix their shit soon or this game will just continue to be awful in terms of overall quality.
---
Tons, never have a hard time finding a group for anything, always see players around and pretty much everything is active.

---
&gt;I love Living World Masteries, but non-mount Masteries often offer only one progression track. Since multiple progression tracks give players more meaningful reasons to play together in a map—and more new things to do after putting in time playing their level-80 characters—I set out to develop a system that would give players a crystal-clear way to progress toward the endgame rewards in *The Icebrood Saga *. The result of the team’s hard work is Essence Manipulation, which is made up of three Masteries, each with two tiers. Combined with the two-tiered Raven Spirit Mastery, that’s eight tracks of player progression!
---
&gt;I started with ideas and inspiration from games that use the old “rock, paper, scissors” approach to their balance and progression systems. For example, players want to obtain “rock” and level it up so they can defeat powerful “scissor” creatures. Games like the *Monster Hunter™* series even incorporate this into their gear and weapon progression.
---
&gt;Our goal was to make this type of system, in which the game mechanics are heavily interconnected, an important part of “[Whisper in the Dark]().” To satisfy that goal, it would need to be integral to fighting the enemies on the map, completing Strike Missions, and obtaining rewards. Communicating the system to the player is key, because it can be very complex, so you’ll discover information about it through achievements, icons, props, enhancements, open-world dialogue, and NPC conversations.
---
&gt;A lot of team members contributed feedback, and we spent months designing, implementing, playtesting, and iterating to bring Essence Manipulation to life. Essence Manipulation is divided into three separate Mastery tracks: Vigilance, Resilience, and Valor. Each is strong against another:
---
&gt;* Vigilance is strong against Resilience.
---
&gt;* Resilience is strong against Valor.
---
&gt;* Valor is strong against Vigilance.
---
&gt;Different types of enemies on the map embody these essences, and share their weaknesses:
---
&gt;* Svanir embody the essence of Vigilance.
---
&gt;* Fallen embody the essence of Resilience.
---
&gt;* Aberrant embody the essence of Valor.
---

&gt;[[https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/7009bgw694-590x332.png](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/7009bgw694-590x332.png)](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/7009bgw694.png)
---
&gt;Unlocking the Essence Manipulation Mastery allows you to pick up essence orbs that drop from corresponding enemies. Picking up an orb immediately grants a temporary enhancement stack with benefits that improve with the Mastery’s second tier:
---
&gt;**Vigilance**
---
&gt;* Gain 5 seconds of fury, 15% endurance regeneration, and 4 seconds of swiftness.
---
&gt;**Resilience**
---
&gt;* Gain 10 seconds of might, 400 health, and 4 seconds of swiftness.
---
&gt;**Valor**
---
&gt;* Gain 3 seconds of quickness and 4 seconds of swiftness.
---
&gt;Obtaining 30 stacks will activate the Mastery’s passive benefits for fifteen minutes, making it easier to fight creatures weak against that essence. While active, you’ll also gain access to powerful offensive abilities through a special action skill. These abilities will be available for use in specific situations, like at certain enemy health thresholds or when defiance bars are exposed.
---
&gt;The percentage chance will increase with each tier unlocked, and the offensive abilities will become more powerful after unlocking the second tier.
---
&gt;* Gain a 33% chance to steal life on critical hits to Fallen enemies. Gain the ability to use the Shattered Psyche special action skill. Gain a 1.5-second cooldown reduction when picking up an essence.
---
&gt;* Shattered Psyche: This powerful blast deals immense damage and causes lesser creatures to float in the air. (Applies 15 seconds of fury at tier 2.)
---
&gt;* Gain a 30% duration reduction from conditions from Aberrant creatures. Gain the ability to use the Spirit Nova special action skill. Gain a 1.5-second skill cooldown reduction when picking up an essence.
---
&gt;* Spirit Nova: This powerful blast deals immense damage and launches lesser creatures. (Applies 10 stacks of might for 8 seconds at tier 2.)
---
&gt;* Gain a 10% damage reduction from Svanir enemies. Gain the ability to use the Night Terror special action skill. Gain a 1.5-second skill cooldown reduction when picking up an essence.
---
&gt;* Night Terror: This powerful blast deals immense damage and pulls lesser creatures into its destruction. (Applies 8 seconds of quickness at tier 2.)
---
&gt;Players will also find special chests in Strike Missions and the open world that can only be opened with the Essence Manipulation Mastery the chest is weak to. Bigger chests will need the second-tier Mastery to open, so you’ll want to upgrade your Essence Manipulation for maximum potential rewards!
---
&gt;Once you’ve trained an essence, you’ll have some fun decisions to make about how you build your character and play in the map. You might decide you have enough stacks of might from resilience and forego might-enhancing traits for something else. With Build and Equipment Templates, this exploration and experimentation is easier. Players who’ve fully trained Essence Manipulation should be able to take down tough enemies—including champions and Strike Mission bosses—with fewer than the recommended number of allies.
---
&gt;When roaming the map, you can choose to be as efficient as possible by farming up essence orbs in a creature-specific area, then head for events with creatures that are weak against that essence, farming up the next round of orbs and grabbing chests along the way.
---
&gt;#### Unlocking Essence Manipulation

&gt;[[https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/613d9New-Mastery-Raven-Attunement-590x332.jpg](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/613d9New-Mastery-Raven-Attunement-590x332.jpg)](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/613d9New-Mastery-Raven-Attunement.jpg)
---
&gt;You’ll first need to unlock the second tier of the Raven Attunement Mastery track. After that, choose an essence to start with and train it by gaining experience and Mastery points. You’ll find an NPC in the map named Researcher Yarixx who can give you a tutorial at any time, even if you don’t have the Mastery unlocked yet.
---
&gt;The next episode of *The Icebrood Saga * will introduce another tier for each essence, for a total of three tiers each. Trust me—you’re going to need the extra power. We’re so excited for you to explore the many different facets of these new Masteries!
---
&gt;If you’re interested in learning more about how we developed and iterated on Essence Manipulation—including some of the challenges we faced—don’t miss the next episode of Guild Chat at noon Pacific Time (UTC-8) on Friday, November 15.

because NCSOFT needs €€€€€
---
The problem isn’t the bounty not working is the refresh that takes hours
---
i don't like this.
---
Druid Stone marked the last time I spent any time going out of my way for achievements in LS episodes, including collections and meta achievements. I completed it, and It really exacerbated how everything was just more of the same and trying to steal time from you with uninspired content.
---
After writing this, I went to [this recent post comparing the number of people that completed the meta achievement every release](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b5r9ok/episode_mastery_achievement_statistics_according/), and Flashpoint has the biggest dip by far. Guess many felt the same way.
---
Agony, Torment, PAIN!!
---
So it's Rock Paper Scissors: Energy Beam edition
---
I think they could do that while still keeping Glenna in all of them. It’s like the djinn announcer for the new PvP map; it wouldn’t feel right without the old one!
---
You're intentionally not getting it. In current situation, people can report the message you just posted. And if needed get support to get an official case of threat to your life and possibly get police involved. However if a message in chat is [Empty chat]                                 [/Empty chat] but an app can turn that in to "Hey want to help me organise a terrorist attack at insert location." A-net can't help stop that. Am i showing worse case situation? Yes, mostly because apparently that is needed for you lot to get it. Is it a likely scenario? No, but that's no excuse to exploiting an oversight of A-nets chat system. The issue isn't if it would happen. its that it COULD happen.
---
Ele flashbacks....
---
ok there is so much to say i'll try to make it clear given english is not my native language (but i think you would already understand that).
---
There is a lot to say i don't have much time but i hope i won't forget something. But i think we can already all agree that most of the problems we talk about can be resolved by education. The problem is how
---
1st, i hate parity. For all the reasons you talked about in the private context. Parity is discrimination and even "positive" discrimination is still discrimination. But yes when a woman have less chances to be elected because she is a woman we have a problem because just as you said the only reasons we should consider when voting for someone is competence alone. But that s is not the case right now. Even without speculating on the reasons, we have a majority that will vote for a man over a woman. But the reasons behind all these men touch as much as women and he should show us how incidious they are. Hence the parity = force to have woman in politics because you actually educate people to see that women are as good as this as men.
---
Shit is frustating in english lol, it feels like trying to have a advanced conversation with grade school vocabulary. i'll come back later to finish this as i don't have more time.
---
So they're trying to add another layer of depth to combat. Why did we get this, and not another set of elite specs?
---
Been gone awhile and I'm only just learning about all of this.
---
I wish the had left Arc's Templates alone while pushing this with its own advantages (instant swapping/free inventory) so that if something like this mess had occurred, then those who really relied on them would at least have an alternative.
---
Not having Arc's templates on top of this not working so well and needing who knows how long to be ironed out just really sucks for almost everyone involved.
---
At least it will not be limited to this one episode like stuff from the past.
---
This guy is just a hardcore rager coming on subs to shit talk. I'd take what he says with a grain of salt. 95% of his GW2 post are vengeful ex lover status.
---
I'd argue that having important plot related to the main story in raids would be very harmful to the games reception by fans.
---
While a lot of players do play them, it's still only a mere fraction of the full playerbase. Locking the main story behind raids only alienates players. Hence why wing 1-4 was heavily criticized by many fans of the story and lore.
---
Now having LORE tie into raids is different. I think wing 5-7 handled that concept really well because it explores places and characters that aren't featured in the main story. While the threats are still very real.
---
I had to explain the plot of wing 1-4 while showing the cutscenes on youtube, before I played through season 3 with my friend. Because there was no way he'd be able learn and play that content in a reasonable amount of time.
---
That would be an expansion level feature. You can't expect th-- wait...
---
This guy is just a rager with no clue. Of course he is guessing. He comes on this sub to shit talk.
---
I play the game however I want!!
---
Well, that's really easy. 
---
5 PoF maps
---
6 Living World Season 4 maps, all in the desert region
---
Grothmar Valley
---
There's your last 12 maps, 11 of which are all clumped together in the bottom right corner of the world map. Literally, that is the entire expansion area. Grothmar is a charr zone so it's up in charr territory.
---
What do I win?
---
This guy doesn't play guild Wars 2 and just comes on this sub to shit talk.
---
Ah, another mastery I will forget about as soon as I'm done leveling it, cool I guess. This sounds more like a pain in the ass than any kind of fun.
---
We'll see about that
---
Anet will expand Bjora Marches with episode 2, therefore it's still one map.
---
&gt; Jason: I bet Cthulhu could kill it on the drums, I'm just saying. But yeah, so there's going to be a dynamic growth of the map between episode one and two. New areas, new stories, new achievements, new events, mastery unlocks, all that across the two episodes, and we're really looking forward to this different dynamic approach.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Icebrood_Saga_announcement
---
Okay honestly, do we even need new masteries? Can't say I'd miss them if they were removed. 
---
Hell I couldn't even name more than 1 mastery that was added with living story over the years. To me it's just more annoying content gating and pointless grind for something I'll stop using hours after unlocking it.
---
It's not just GW2, I dislike most non-class related progression in other MMOs as well (like essences in WoW). Wish this trend would stop.
---
It feels "every episode has new mastery, so we need to create another one, no matter what".
---
I hope it could mean a new expansion after icebrood saga...
---
"Orbs of Light" .... what an original concept xD
---
I'm looking forward to seeing how this pans out most of all, to be honest. The Drytop and Silverwastes map expansions were fun and it's a system that I've seen many players asking for Anet to bring back. This should be interesting.
---
Anet is notorious for having wages below industry standards tho, so the difference between Anet and korean sales may not be that huge.
---
I think they were close, but Aion is not very stable. Aion is making around the same as GW2 but, at the same time, Aion is somehow subscription based (lot of functions locked between premisum status) plus the store that sell P2W things. GW2 is selling skins only and makes almost as much, that's why I said Aion is not very stable. I would be happy to pay subscription for GW2 if needed, but I want them to focus on it and stop doing other shitty projects then close them.
---
It stands to reason they are when they'll be used in the map where the story takes place and we might need to use them go get through
---
&gt; The next episode of The Icebrood Saga  will introduce another tier for each essence, for a total of three tiers each.
---
So that should should mean it should at least remain usable for episode 2. It would make more sense if it worked for the whole saga. I really hope that is the case. That would actually make it more like an expansion with some more coherent content.
---
I smell power creep and "gear treadmills"
---
But actually looking at this and the history of masteries they can and have been mostly applicable to the season in which they are implemented while the other uses are quality of life.  If this is saying each season will require me to level masteries in order for my character to be strong enough to finish a season, while at first I wondered why they would add an inconvenience to just wanting to play the next story chapter, it's actually a healthy use of the system in my opinion.  I can no longer log in with my guardian, press my burst rotation, and wonder if that was 4 or 5 veterans who died?  Each season is a chance of making a new build? That actually sounds great.  That feeling on the first days of discovering a new build that works is great.  If masteries evolve into build variatios/options for each season I say good on you for developing  "gear treadmills" contained to game sections.  My ascended armour doesn't lose value but I'm faced with the challenge of being underpowered and needing to figure out how to progress.  A good balance between feeling like I can accomplish something and not worrying that I will fall behind if I miss a season.
---
TL;DR
---
Forged sk8ter boi says hi.
---
ok...
---
"Trust me—you’re going to need the extra power."
---
I think it might be tied to the world boss (drakkar or whatever don't remember) that is supposed to come with 2nd episode and be Triple trouble like or something like that.
---
Player retention, as in keeping the player actively logging on and playing the game over a longer period of time. Often times studios measure several periods like 1d, 3d or 30d retention.  
---
In my case the survey is a small step to help determine to what extent events keep players in the game, and why.
---
It does affect me.  They are spending time developing something like this which really is only there to help people unwilling to help themselves.  The game is really easy as far as open world goes, so I don't think spending money and time developing something like this is the best use.  That's my opinion.  If this was something that didn't require excessive time like they stated it did, it wouldn't be an issue.  But to use lots of resources for something like this is incredibly dumb, again, IMO.
---
These are my initial concerns after reading.
---
1. Groups might now only allow people in strikes with certain masteries to fit the boss and group setup. This then adds the gating/ limitations etc that put people off raids in the first place.
---
2. We are going to have people running around clueless with no care in the world for what the masteries do that could potentially mean they have the wrong "rock paper scissors" thing selected and potentially gimp smaller group content, or find the content so hard the map suffers numbers a little, so we have to hunt populated map IDs like we have to in tripple trouble.
---
*this conflicts with my comments in point 1 a little*
---
3. This almost reads - 
---
Q how can we force people to buy into the build templates? 
---
A. Yes we design a map around min maxing your build for the map and its mobs. And let's not make the templates work like templates where you can change the odd skill manually in your skill  bar without it affected the original settings.
---
...........
---
I am really looking forward to all of this though. I loved the HoT expansion and the difficulty  of the maps.
---
GW2 has actually been quite stable financially, there are of course the spikes around Expansion releases but aside from that there's been relatively little fluctuation between quarters.
---
Nah, this is based on fighting enemy types that will be present through the entire saga.
---
i never said i didn't enjoy story content that can be beaten in a couple of hours though?
---
I don't expect them to be that difficult, but even if it felt like HoT as it currently is, I would be happy.
---
i found completing them fairly obnoxious since it means i have to grind instead of being able to progress in the story.
---
&gt; I have a problem so EVERYONE has a problem
---
We can pull this into the extreme in both directions, mate
---

---
Not sure about where you work, my job is getting the new releases out and fixing bugs "when you have time".  If a new promotion is coming out in the next catalog drop, you will have the new options available before the catalog is released, bugs will have to wait.
---
So, are you saying that you only want ANet to create story/raid/fractal content and absolutely no more progression of any sort?
---
I'm not sure the majority of players would agree with you (if that's the case)
---
I achievement hunt and play Wvw.
---
That’s a huge reach. First of all, it’s not that casual players are “unwilling to help themselves,” it’s that they enjoy playing the game differently than you. Judging them for that just makes you look like an elitist jerk. 
---
Second of all, these resources were allocated to this for a reason. The idea that you know better than ArenaNet how their resources should be allocated is laughably arrogant. 
---
You’re just looking for a reason to whine.
---
Can you stop "destroying" this sub? People are just posting their opinions. And what will anet do if this, or that, happens you definitely dont know. And fyi, its not new topic. Happens literally every time when new map comes out. So chill. o/
---
No, there was another one with blue mastery points and an icebrood saga banner.
---
https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/1184193589569642497
---
Very true.
---
Still won't care about this thing much. Building swapping is too much of a hassle to remember to do. 
---
That is also for solo. Once you throw other people into the mix then chances are no amount of nerfing will work short of nerfing those things out of existence.
---
Maybe this guy has something to do with the Age of Giants?
---
Based on the phrasing and mechanics I suspect that will be the case, with each pair of episodes introducing a new Spirit-themed Mastery and probably adding on to the three Essence Masteries. I suspect that by the end we'll have 4 Spirit Masteries with 3-4 Tiers each and 3 Essence Masteries with 5-6 Tiers each all spread out across 4 maps and 8 episodes, maybe with some other stuff thrown in to round it out a bit. One pair of episodes might introduce a new Mount if they don't want to make the Essence Masteries to lengthy, for example.
---
I'm just crossing my fingers that these new masteries actually take time to unlock and it isn't like PoF where you get each one done in a couple hours... I want some meaty progression!
---
They have some v rare expensive drops but otherwise just orbs and hatched chillis
---
This sounds more and more like Aegis from TSW. Don't like it. Don't want it. Echos of grind still haunt me!
---
lol no, dungeons are the same crap since the last 4 yaers or so, they never touched them again, fractal players are complaining about lack of new content everyday in forums, also it seems they have tons of bugs, some can even ruin your run
---
" How would the game be for people who just want to run some content like the Dungeons and Fractals and not have to grind to much, but haven't played since 2012? "
---
boring and repetitive, right now if you don't enjoy a single player story mode about killing millions of brainless mobs, and some elites that miss almost every attack, or big maps with mobs that give some sort of currency that players farm for hours and hours just to get gold so they can buy gems... i think you will find it boring and repetitive, pvp and wvw are dead with no real upgrades or new content for two years, class balance is a joke, they release a new raid every year, and they get easier and easier on each release so you can finish them in a few hours, dungeons are the same crap they were before you left, fractals suffer the same problems as the raid community has, and it really shows anet focus right now is in open world content (treadmills killing brainless mobs to farm currency) and living story episodes (same stupid missions we always got with new characters, dialogues and cutscenes) and ofcourse cash shop, monetizing almost anything they can, and selling tons of skins of chairs, mounts, costumes, etc...
---
even adding "new features" like a mount for wvw which later we would find out they were realeased just as an excuse to sell skins, meanwhile the release was so crappy they lost tons of players over night, same with build templates and most of the last releases
---
the game as a product has reached one of the lowest levels quality wise, and as a guy who has been playing for 5 years nonstop im really sad i can't recommend anyone to buy this game, on the contrary i try to keep players away from this game because im so dissapointed at how anet managed this hell of  a game
---
so much potential... wasted...
---
TIL Steve is actually a Necromancer
---
I agree. I like that post HoT wings involve other important NPC's who drive the story while Glenna is just there for assistance and being a merchant.
---
Plus additional backstory, comic relief, and being adorable
---
Wait..why would you wait to attack them in the first place?  Wolves are just a Cut of Quality Red Meat waiting for you to free it.
---
Yeah, it may not be retroactive but it sounds like the idea is that it'll be a normal feature moving forward. Sounds more than reasonable to me.
---
Ooooh that one. I completely forgot about it. Yeah that makes sense then indeed.
---
NA player here, I was having awful (worst lag I've ever experienced) lag in Vabbi yesterday night. I've played for about a year and never had lag like that. I was convinced it was my end until some people in chat started complaining.
---
&gt; Instead, we get an easy-way-out system that looks like it might not be well plotted.
---
It feels like a system that was designed for coordinated content, such as a set of raid wings, but that was put into open-world content - where people just honestly want to jump in, zerg, spam, have their bit of fun and move on to the next thing.
---
It's sure easier for me, lol. I swap between my DPS and support build on the fly when ever I want to. And I've needed to quite a few times. No more going through my inventory and trying to memorize every trait.
---
The new skill is a special action key, it does not change anything in your skillbar.
---
Came in expecting a post about a post for a Friday Guild Chat. I'm not disappointed.
---
Unlike a bunch of other people here.
---
meh
---
&gt; multi-level resetting gear grind
---
View it as stacking sigils like bloodlust.
---
It is great to see a reasonable comment under this thread, I thought this one is only filled by emotional hater comments. thank you
---
Core s/d. I find it the funniest to play and even the hardest to master. I think it's cool that it doesn't rely on cheesy tactics like excessive stealth abuse.
---
&gt; Holy shit everyone here so far seems SUPER down on this. 
---
/r/guildwars2 is a cesspool. Makes my chronic depression look like a unicorn with rainbow farts.
---
They are meant to bridge the gap in terms of difficulty (though they do so poorly) but thats a bout it.  I'm talking about an actual story mode to raids, something to allow players to see said raids, get sorta used to some mechanics but in a solo environment.  It then also allows the raids to actually be these big capstones of the story.
---
Though I wouldn't mind a lower difficulty set of raids either for group content (and if possible a higher one for hardcore, but at this point this has gone from wishes to hoping for miracles), theres a reason every major raiding MMO does this, it works great to get players more comfortable in said raiding environment.  Strike missions were cool in theory but really missed the mark, and having it set in the actual raid would be nice to get players a chance to see a large portion of mechanics from the more difficult versions of the fights, making the transition easier.
---
I didn't like the timegates on Skyscale collection as there were too many. Not to mention the map currency stuff, it caught me off guard as I expected currencies would be needed for a legendary trinket and not for mount itself. I wouldn't say that I hated the collection, the actual collection was nice and going back to other LS4 maps wasn't actually that bad. Its just that the padding was unnecessary imo.
---
Re read the news post. It said that you "may want to adjust your build if you dont need too much light etc" due to the passive effects. they then threw in how great build templates are for this. 
---
Cant remember exact words, but is was along those lines
---
Yup. I hope it works, I like the first one ok, even if it is easier than I expected with how they advertised them.
---
There's a current [discussion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Talk:Queer_characters#Reworking.2Frenaming_the_article) on the wiki about renaming the article, feel free to weigh in!
---
In OP defense, reddit's search function is dog shit.....
---
I'm coming back to GW2 after at least 2 years of game hopping, I played BDO, I played DragonNest EU before it died...I played Bless...I've seen P2w, I highly doubt GW2 has approached THAT level, but as I download, I guess we'll see.
---
All you get is new special action key, this does not change your build in any way.
---
It should be on sale right now.
---
40% off LWS2, 30% off LWS3, 20% off LWS4
---
The post you replied on was talking about the "impact of build templates on the revenue". All I'm saying here is that since you and your friend left much before that, that didn't affect the "impact of build template revenue" at all, positive or negative.
---
Since when did predicting something make it real. I predict Labour are going to win the 2019 Election does that mean its going to happen no. I'm not going to stop predicting and speculating things just because people believe is actually going to happen.
---
But even letting people taste what those boons actually do is enough for some to actually want to learn about them a bit more...
---
Maybe it's along the lines of pushing them to actually make changes, as they'll have tasted the difference of proper damage levels now?
---
I'm rocking Ryzen 5 3600, 32 GBs (3200 MHz), and a 1070. Six instances puts me between 90-100% usage across all threads (with boost to 4 GHz), a single instance drops overall usage below 40% with two threads reaching the 90% mark. I have no ability to discern changes in FPS, but whenever I bother to gauge the range, I'm getting anything between 30 and 90 FPS.
---
I experienced instability with 16 GBs (five instances at the time), but admittedly I didn't bother investigating any plausible hardware issue, as it was a suitable time for an upgrade regardless. My six instances hit 20 GB usage, and a single instance sits around 8 GB.
---
Opinions: I'd consider going straight for the Ryzen 3000-series, but if you're eyeing a great deal on the 2700x, at least pick a decent motherboard. Go for the fastest RAM you can, I'd go no slower than 3200 MHz.
---
Might, fury and quickness are boons you want when starting a fight, not after it's over.
---
I mean it literally is less egregious than p2w. You mean to tell me that if tomorrow ANet put "Mythic" level gear in the gem store and it had better stats than ascended, it wouldn't be more egregious?
---
For the record, I'm against the implementation of build templates, but this hyperbole is kinda nutty.
---
The many achievements and collections associated with it?  Is this a rhetorical question?
---
Are we out of codes? If not hook me up
---
When they add something like this, they should also go to some spots in previous maps that have nothing going on or that are underused, and add something interesting that uses it.
---
Altering templates with auto save because of one trait seems rather annoying to me.
---
can you tell me where they are on this map? https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Tyria_map_(clean).jpg
---
im thinking they might be thematically relevant to the story. "these are the virtues that we need to inspire in people to resist the pull of jormag's propaganda" sort of thing. 
---
vigilance to watch over ourselves and our allies to make sure none of us are falling for it. resillience to hold on psycologically during a long campaign against an unrelenting enemy. valor to become a symbol that other people want to stand by, and wont abandon for the dragon.
---
this is the second time I have to clarify I hate the fractal design, I wasn't talking about the difficulty, what it supposedly teaches, what you need to clear it, if it's a correct comp or not.
---
I am saying it's shit, how is that hard to grasp.
---
I mean, yes. You're right that the majority of the people who complain about being falsely banned are talking out of their asses. That said, I've never seen a game where so many of the ban waves did turn out to have actual issues. Most of these issues shouldn't have ever happened, and if they did, they should have been handled through support. But ArenaNet consistently chooses not to. That's why it's negligence. The fact is that "most of their bans are accurate" is just not a very high bar, especially considering how many bans are based on easily detectable things (like people running around saying the N word).
---
And the fact that Chris Cleary would send out tweets every time trash talking the people he banned was just the cherry on top. Having to constantly delete tweets because you didn't do your job properly... It's a wonder they didn't muzzle him sooner considering how much they emphasized devs not communicating on reddit for a while.
---
This sounds like a lot of fluff for a mastery system that will rapidly become irrelevant. Sure it can be used in the Icebrood maps but what’s the actual point? Having an energy beam you can use to unlock chests that give one unidentified green gear? This doesn’t really sound like character progression it just sounds like another gimmicky mastery system that will see little long term value. To that extent, the sirens of orr and turret system in Kourna could have been advertised with the same lengthy blogpost but it wouldn’t have made them any more valuable. I guess the lengthy description is meant to make it sound more like an expansion level feature? Eh.
---
Why would you ever want a game to pick your graphics settings. They almost always low ball
---
WvW last night ( late EU ) was shocking, 2800 pings, i had to load the map twice to see team colors, everyone was reporting the same issue, apparently fixing the lag issues are not a priority anymore.
---
I've pugged enough to see that people don't give a fuck, they play how they want and if that means they can auto on their longbow dh and do 1k, they will do it.
---
You must not have enjoyed the core personal story very much then, with its level requirements for progression.
---
Yeah, under tuned and it's just something you completely ignore.
---
Over tuned, and you're forced to play the gimmick instead of the game.
---
And I'm not sure this Venn diagram has any happy medium.
---
Unfortunately for as rough of a patch as ANet has been going through, I think this looks like another tone deaf bright idea that nobody was asking for, nobody wants, and that everyone will avoid truly engaging with, whether that's by playing as if they don't exist, or if you're forced to use them in new areas, by completing content and thereafter avoiding those areas altogether.
---
Of you want to start fresh, just make a new account. That way if you change your mind, the original still exists.
---
&gt; This has no bearing on the discussion about if we like this kind of mastery or not.
---
"Whether the names of Rock, Paper and Scissors offer an instant intuitive and memorable description of the core mechanic is irrelevant to whether players will like the game or not. Those could as well be called Foo, Waa and Mee, where Foo is strong against Waa, Waa is strong instead of Mee, and Mee is strong against Foo."
---
I think they had to sell the table it was on.
---
I mean, I'm talking about having lower difficulty raids *in addition* to the normal wings.  Hence the reason why I'm talking about other raiding MMOs and how they do it.
---
For example Raid Wing 5 would look like:
---
- Wing 5 (Story)
---
- Wing 5 (Normal)
---
- Wing 5 (Hard)
---
With the story mode having all the same bosses with only some of the mechanics or easier versions of said mechanics.  Hard would then of course mix in more difficult stuff.  The raiding community took a hit far longer back than build templates because the game simply does not get enough raiding content for most people interested in raiding.  Anet can't justify it because of the low % of players who actually raid.  Bridging that gap like all of the healthy raiding MMO's is how you fix that, and taking a page from their book having multiple difficulties to give an entry point as well as an exciting endgame point to get people hyped up about even if it's just watching on streams is a good direction to go towards.  I would probably be a bit more work than strike missions sure, but all of the assets and such are still there so it's still just tweaking older fights.  Even if they still plan to keep with the strike missions, doing them for raid bosses makes far more sense than story bosses if they are trying to push people into raids.
---
Because grinding 15k mobs and buy the thing off the TP is better than grinding 15k mobs and buy it off the gemstore. Sigh.
---
I understand your need to defend everything and not allow any criticism, you must've invested lots of money into gems.  I like how disagreeing with you makes me an entitled whiner.  Lol, you don't actually make a valid argument against what I have said.  You resort to name calling and not actually trying to say why I am wrong.  "you're wrong entitled whiner" is a pretty shit argument lol.  Anyways, no point in discussing further as your brain is clearly unable to form actual valid arguments.
---
Yeah, I've been playing nearly daily since October '18 (after a bit of a break after PoF).. 
---
Haven't played since I finished the Halloween achievements 1.5 weeks into the festival.. 
---
I might hop in to play the new story over a weekend after it drops. But nothing is really bringing me in to stay. 
---
I thought build templates would do that as I could have fun trying out all the builds posted online on the fly, but that's not happening..

(taken from other sub xD)
---
Imagine a sub where official announcements will always get upvoted, despite people's personal feelings.
---
Especially all these seasons are good news for everyone who wants to catch up on story and content.
---
Recently upgraded from i7-4790k and got a big increase in FPS, having high single-core performance will increase performance for games in general.
---
Using a 3700x it seems to stay around 15% CPU usage on Mistlock Sanctuary, it'll depend on your settings and map as well. Most of the utilization is from 2 threads. 
---
Can't comment much on multiboxing as i only have 2 accounts and CPU usage will stay around 30% running both.
---
Should have a pretty noticeable boost in FPS and utilization going from an old-ish 4/4 to more modern CPU's, though if you only plan on gaming (or mostly gaming), 3600 might be interesting as well, better single-core performance but 6/12 instead.
---
Pvp is the true end game content
---
This has nothing to do with GW2, this is in reference to WoW players moving over to FFXIV, hence the bunny girl which is a race in FFXIV called the Veena

Did I read well? 8 masteries?!!  
---
It seems my birthday &amp; exp boosters sitting in bank finally have a use.
---
Alternatively, addressing the types of changes people want aren't quick and easy fixes. This stuff takes time.
---
The original comic is infuriating.  They are the Mario Brothers because it's their last goddamn name!  Mario Mario and Luigi Mario!
---
&gt; Hence the parity = force to have woman in politics because you actually educate people to see that women are as good as this as men.
---
See this is where I think that plan falls apart. People are overly critical of things they dislike in general but this is *POLITICS* we're talking about here. Unless an opposing side keeps forcing hostilities like they did with Drumpf even the loyal supporters have little to say other than gripe about how their party/candidate **still** fails to live up to their expectations. Look at Margeret Thatcher or Angela Merkel, neither got the job through affirmative action but they aren't/weren't all that popular. By now Merkel is basically sitting on "well, no one *else* will do a better job anyway".
---
Not to mention anyone opposed to any particular woman's party. You think everyone calling you a corrupt soulless parasite is bad, add "I knew whamen couldn't do a man's job!" and "you only got in on the quota!" to the pile. Props to any woman who does actually want to do it but trying to force the issue via quotas when discrimination has been outlawed on paper gives way too much ammo to *actual* misogynists and hateful trolls. 
---
Plus how many women actually *want* to become full-time politicians or top executives? Shouldn't the effort instead be focused on things like women needing to lose about 2 years of their prime career-building years so we don't die out as a species? Or figuring out a fair and effective way of handling bullying and sexual harassment in the workplace so no one has to put up with that shit and women aren't being snubbed for fear of false accusations either?
---
I do understand that there's a race in the ffxiv with bunny ears, but I've been also seeing a lot of people in gw2 with bunny/cat ears.
---
Congrats!! Nothing small about that victory!
---
People please don't forget that NCwest destroyed Blade and Soul due to extreme p2w cash shop and scammy in-game systems, now NCwest has a big part of Gw2... When they merged the first thing NCwest dis was to nerf SW and Istan. Now the monetization of build templates.
---
Don’t remind me why I left that game. Females got bunnies and males got... something gross. Gunbreaker should have been a dps and dancer should have been a healer.
---
Lolol
---
Well yeah, easily. Starting at Thunderhead Peak (west of the brand scar, SW of Fields of Ruin) you go south and get
---
* Desert Highlands
---
* Crystal Oasis
---
* Elon Riverlands
---
* The Desolation
---
* Domain of Vabbi
---
Then south of Vabbi (where the brand scar curves) you have Jahai Bluffs, then South to Kourna. Go west to the island and you have Istan. North of istan is the Sandswept Isles.
---
The big blocky island south of Orr is Dragonfall.
---
The new isolated zome in the north of Charr lands is Frothmar Valley.
---
There, all of PoF, Season 4, and Bound by Blood. I can keep going if you want.
---
They're called the Viera.
---
I totally get it, but adding overly good rewards in PvP/WvW have caused issues in the past where people came to leech and didn't contribute, so I understand why they decided to just stick with exotics. Also I think for most people the reward is a free cool looking skin rather than the exotic armor piece (Most WvWers are already rocking ascended gear anyway). These reward tracks are great for those who really don't like doing PvE, but they still allow PvP/WvWers to get nice skins without having to leave their prefered gamemode :) I finished majority of HoT skin sets through these tracks.
---
&gt;There is no way they wont give us new snowy logging screen  
---
If I were you, I woundn't be so sure...
---
Yep. Pair that with how unoriginal the new legendary was and I instantly went super casual with my play style: no raids, unnecessary achievements, or fractal CM’s. The level of toxic players I encounter now is zero.
---
Are you also using d912pxy (DX9 to DX12) or d9vk (DX9 to Vulkan) to efficiently utilize all your cores? It changes the FPS by a lot.
---
I'll never not upvote this posts. It's always nice to see people enjoying the game.
---
Congrats! Seriously though, how did you manage to kick THAT can down the road for so long?
---
the gifts get better every year...
---
This needs a whole post of it's own.
---
Fuck you, soldier player.
---
*old-people gooling of whippersnapper-slang*
---
Ah. Yes, that's funny.
---
/r/TrahearneJokes
---
DS has really fallen out of popularity lately, especially because they added amalgamated gemstones to PoF metas.
---
Do you take literally a minute to kill the pinata for your gemstone, or do DS for an hour and a half?
---
There's other newer maps being added like Dragonfall for gold too.
---
I still like to do it because I think it's one of the most fun metas in the game, and sometimes need crystalline ore. But unless you need achievements, or ore... there's honestly not a whole lot of reason to go back to it, sad to say.
---
[This is the best benchmark I've found for GW2](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html); the higher on that list, the better.  The 2700x likely wouldn't perform much better than your current CPU.
---
Instead of spending $200 on a 2700x (plus you'll need a new motherboard to be compatible), you'd do much better spending $45 more and getting the 3600x.
---
It's unlikely, but depending on your chipset you might be able to keep your motherboard and get an i5-9600k for $220.
---
I agree.  What they could have done is make it apply to all maps, but not just for characters.  If they did that, that increases power creep.  To counter, you need all creatures to have access to the masteries too which they can use on the player.  
---
If the player doesn't have the mastery, then the creature wouldn't use the mastery on that player (to keep it fair for people who don't have access to it).  
---
That would add a sense of newness to all maps, dungeons, fractals, etc.
---
What a uselessly convoluted mastery. It's just going to wind up not used and absolutely ignored.
---
Still applies, as we've got the bunny ears, the conjurer chest and the sorcerer's legs that pretty much look like that when combined.
---
nope https://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/final-fantasy-xiv-shadowbringers-dancer-2.jpg
---
NGL that screen made me think you were in the Chantry of Secrets and were getting the bug haha
---
Yes, but imagine when those masteries then continue to exist beyond the map.  Gliding could have been made to be just in HoT maps, but it was expanded to all maps later
---
Can always check out other game modes like WvW or PVP. Crafting is good for a lot of things, especially if you end up trying fractals and wanting to do high level ones (need ascended armor which is only via crafting).
---
 Exploration is good for world complete, that + crafting is good if you want to work towards making a legendary. Lots of options! :)
---
Nothing "still" about GW2's population and level of activity.
---
Yes. No one does Draconis Mons anymore.
---
Gunslingers have always been ranger DPS and dancers have always been enemy debuff and ally support in FF games.
---
What did they do that for FFXIV?
---
WvW is a 3 way server wide PvP mode where you try to claim points by capturing nodes and killing enemy server players
---
People complain when they do nothing.

    Living World Season 4 Complete Pack—20% Off
---
    Living World Season 3 Complete Pack—30% Off
---
    Living World Season 2 Complete Pack—40% Off
---
Price varied depending on how many you already have unlocked. Then it loses the percentage. I think I remember 640 gems or something for S2. But you'll have to look it up for yourself, once you got them all, you can't check on the offer anymore.
---
Then I guess you won't need it, and can focus on the other content.
---
It'll be a real shame though, if they are required for getting through spots on maps,  etc and you, sticking to your principles, ignore them. 
---
That'll show em!
---
Are you serious ? Don't do it
---
 it gets discounted further for each chapter you own, so the maximum is 
---
- LS2: ~~1280gems~~ (-40%) 768gems
---
- LS3: ~~960gems~~ (-30%) 672gems
---
- LS4: ~~960gems~~ (-20%) 768 gems
---
total **2208 gems**. if you own absolutely nothing right now.
---
I honestly wish they added more skills to the game and made it a challenge in the new map to get them. Add 9 new skills or traits that enable new skills. Don't make them OP, but new ways to give classes a way to play something different across the game. Since Elite Specs. aren't seemingly in the future; stop adding this arcade-style of gameplay. Make these new skills better in that PvE map for events but useful and specific to the class using them. That adds progression for vets and RP for PvE players and reason to use those skills in the new map and across the game. Give Gw2 more of a GW1 feel with skills and less cookie-cutter overall.
---
That actually sounds really cool. Thanks :&gt;
---
Likely, but at the VERY least, if they expand this to also include core Tyria Svanir enemies that drop those essence orbs, we should be able to at least use that component.
---
No, elite specs are meant to be side grades rather than upgrades (although how well that works can be debated). As a result, the elite specs are about opening options for game play but not about restricting it.
---
You can choose to use daggers or a torch, but you aren't restricted to those, even if you choose to equip those elite specs
---
Thank you :&gt;
---
You can still use the Greatsword as a Spellbreaker or Berserker too, the one-handed weapons they add are just options for your toolkit, just like the additional skills as well.
---
I uhh I need a source for this
---
Elite specs  are not stronger than the original specs its only another playstyle
---
That sucks.  MMO is dying genre.  Have you been eyeing going over to another game?
---
Ah, so that's why I see you comment everywhere all the time. You're retired.
---
Runecrafter's has 100% chance of __salvaging__ upgrades i.e. giving lucent motes, symbols, charms.   
---
     
---
Getting back runes/sigils would be __recovering__ (destroys item and you get back the upgrade) (think Black Lion Salvage Kits) or __extracting__ (just removes the upgrade) (think Endless Upgrade Extractor).
---
To answear your raid question, there are currently 7 wings, overall featuring 22 bosses. They are actually really great, to me some of the most enjoyable content there is. Anet is now also doing a new thing called strike missions, which are supposed to be standalone, lot more frequent raid bosses, more frequent because they are using story assets, so theres not a lot of dev time needed behind them.
---
Thanks!
---
She likes platformers and arcady-style games. Beginner to PC gaming.
---
Gunbreaker mentioned here is a gunblade class that tanks. There is a rifle-yielding job in the game that is a ranged DPS.
---
Dancer is a ranged DPS with big focus on ally buff + support. I believe there were players hoping it'd be a melee healer because that's how they played in ffxi.
---
I'm not worried about the Strike mission aspect at all. It sounds like it could be a neat mechanic which requires a bit of organization and the best raid designs are typically ones that are communication-based challenges. Or at least that's my preference I guess.
---
It also sounds like the CM will either force them to matter super hard or disable the advantages you get from them. Could be neat, but I'm not sure if the concept is solid enough until I can see the execution.
---
O I C. And since unidentified gear doesn't have runes, then I'd expect nothing back either way.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
(Gonna get downvoted) i use my build templates fairly often. Warrior swap between power and condi. Ranger swap between condi and heals. Guardian swap between power and heals. Thief swap between daredevil and deadeye.
---
I have copies of my main classes to run other builds on, but these are my mains and I am happy with them
---
Its a neat trick, but I always wondered, what exactly is the reason behind this mechanic?
---
Well i play mmorpgs for pvp, because i belive it's the best endgame content they can offer, specially massive pvp maps with objectives, never found a mmo with a real engaging and exiting combat pve wise, so i went to ESO (elder scrolls online) because they offer this map called cyrodiil which is kind of like wvw but only in one map, with set servers (to swap alliances you have to create a new character so no bandwagon)
---
at first i was really doubtfull but after some time i found the game much better than i thought it would be, pve is different
---
pve is about missions with voice acting, and interesting stories, like skyrim, none of those stupid go fetch/kill 15/25 of those and come back
---
pvp is exciting, and it feels like a real action combat game, there are no cooldowns, you have stamina and mana, which recharge slowly over time, theres a lot of focus in melee combat, with blocks, dodges and even parry mechanics, which can stun players leaving them vulnerable for a strong stun all classes can use 
---
it feels like dark souls sometimes
---
cyrodiil is incredible, really huge with a good population, and pvp is weird but fun, with several random game modes cycling, and 3 teams of 4 players each fighting against each other
---
i bought it just to wait for any other game like camelot unchained, but after i realized how good the game actually is im pretty happy with it and i think ill stay some time, it was really cheap the base game and it gave me tons and tons of content
---
other than ESO, the other games everyone is praising online are final fantasy, they say it has some of the best pve out there, but pvp seems to me really bad, archeage unleashed, it sells as the real f2p fair archeage with no p2w, played the original, great game, but idk how this server is doing, and ofc everyone else is waiting for camelot unchained but some say it will release in 2021
---
It also is the prelude to HoT.  Give it to f2p players and they will have more incentives to convert their accounts to paid ones.
---
What genre is arcade-style games? Co-op?
---
Her platformer bone might be tickled by exploration. Tricky PoIs, jump-y Vistas, JPs, naturally. GW2 starts EXTREMELY slow, and Anet even doubled down on it with their "New Player Experience" way back when. So if the diffifulty gets her down, [show her the jump in difficulty with HoT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQvSbjjFvCY).
---
Keep in mind that leveling in GW2 is extremely easy, fast as hell, and can be shortened to like 1 day if you know what you do and pop a few gold. You can even use the lvl80 booster and get her a straight into more engaging content straight away before she gets bored out of her mind.
---
Short answer: Yes, definitely.  Try it out!
---
Long answer: There is no GW3 in sight for the near future (\~2 or 3 next years) and GW2 still receive new updates with new content, quality of life stuff and balance patches regularly. And even putting that aside, the game currently contains hundreds of hours of \*actual\* gameplay content. GW2 has a very horizontal approach when it comes to progression: once you hit level 80 (a matter of week if you play casually, a matter of days if you play more actively) you basically have access to everything the game has to offer in term of gameplay. In other worlds: you won't have to grind X thousands hours to get up to speed with everyone else.
---
And worry not, level 80 is not the end of your journey though! There is a horizontal mastery system for you to unlock new ways to experience the game and ease your progression through the game. Overall this system feels very rewarding.
---
I've been playing for almost 2 years now and GW2 is definitely a great MMO experience. Like any other it has its flaws but it also have a ton of excellent and well designed content. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a new MMO.
---
It is. I'm not defending what happened; just explaining why it did.
---
Bit of advice, ask people to leave a comment so you can PM them.
---
Sure it means more work, but otherwise someone might collect all codes for themselves.
---
Don’t over-explain things or tell her how to be more “efficient” or anything like that.  Just remember the goal is to have fun.
---
Milking? Idk. Ask ArenaNet.
---
Because they're not handled by the same teams, so it's not like because one exists the other is sacrificed. This is living world content, not the skills team.
---
yeah, would be nice. I'm getting desperate :P
---
Best GS dps build in gw2 is dragonhunter, followed by soulbeast. If you define your character solely by weapon, you will be a bit unhappy with warrior. Though, imo axe/axe fits warrior better than a GS anyway.
---
You cant force her to like a game if she doesn't. Let her play what she wants and how she wants.
---
&gt; View it as stacking sigils like bloodlust.
---
Sigils were never a gatekeeper to loot, though.
---
When I did my skyscale, I didn't farm any gold to get it; I already had it courtesy of doing the above.  Maintaining a buffer of ~50g on an account is not hard at all, and if you cant do that the the issue is your spending habits.
---
S2 has some decent rewards in it; at the current discount, I'd definitely recommend grabbing it.
---
The entire season is utterly loaded with Achievement Points and Mastery Points, though some of them are a pain to get, and you can get decent rewards as a result of them - including a set of Nomad's and Sinister trinkets, which are quite powerful.
---
S2E6 will give you a Black Lion Chest Key at its end. S2E8 will give you boosters, an Exotic trinket for which you select any stat combination which can be useful for the time investment required, and each of E5-E8 will reward you with uniquely-skinned rares which you can set stats for. E1-E4 rewards are fairly weak though.
---
I would say *absolutely* get E5-E8. E1-E4 don't be shy about giving a miss though if you want to keep from spending too much.
---
Sounds awesome, thanks!
---
Mismanagement
---
Chrono sharing boons: baaad, boons too easy to come by, horrible, needs severe nerfs.
---
Getting same boons from mastery automatically if you kill crap-creatures: mui bueno, fantastic, such feature, wow.
---
Consistently inconsistent I guess :)
---
Also it feels like they're trying to make mastery into per-character property, which is _very_ strange (otherwise why would you care about build templates, unless we're getting a special new specialization like bar, so 4th one?)
---
&gt; What was actually going on with GW2 in all these years?
---
Management. GW2 is a 1st class race car with spastic monkey behind the wheel.
---
As someone who's recently returned, I'd say the game is worth playing for the story alone. The story is pretty much fully voice-acted (and is really well done if I say so myself), is pretty long and guides you throughout the entire world.
---
Also towards the end there's a lot of cool mounts you can unlock with varying cool abilities.
---
How about you don't force her to play it?
---
It's also quite a big lie to tell her she'll have so many abilities, she won't know which ones to use when the skill choice is very limited in GW2, especially compared to its many competitors.
---
Forcing someone to do anything they don't want to is pretty vile, especially in a relationship.   
---
So, don't let it come to that. Let her make her own decisions. You know, respect and all.
---
See I wouldn’t value 2 boosters a year at 10 bucks myself
---
Change hairstyles on my arts at least once per day.
---
pof doesnt count,but even if it did you are literaly 0,001% of player base who have remote idea where those maps are.
---
Exactly. This design approach is called Metroidvania.
---
I don't think frogs like that cold climate :P
---
The currencies take way more than a day.

Condi only deals more prolonged damage than power in certain scenarios, such as mirage on high attack speed/movement bosses. An easy rule for dps is just to play dragonhunter/daredevil/pchrono on every boss except cairn, largos, SH, matt, and dhuum, where you take mirage, mirage, mirage, mirage, and renegade respectively.
---
I'm pretty sure that the current playerbase for raids is a lot lower. Sad to see it go to waste, but both players as well as developers genuinely deserved their fate. Hopefully something more productive comes from it. And reading your lines, it kind of confirms my opinion. Which is kind of weird, really.
---
I feel that most of this could be done a lot more easily with API, at least as far as the basic demographic stuff (race, profession, etc.). Obviously, there's some things like "Legendary Weapon Goal" that cannot be deduced from the API, but in general I feel that'd speed this up a lot.
---
Off the top of my head, some stuff I can see that would *not* work directly from the API (though there's undoubtedly others):
---
* Legendary Weapon Goal: As this is a "thing I want to do" and not a "thing I have", there's not really any way to programmatically measure this. You could, however, have a filter based on which weapons that character can use (i.e., my necro Asura maybe should not be able to select "HOPE", since neither of the three necro categories can use pistols).
---
* Chosen mount skin (you call this "breed", which I think is a cool idea):  While you *can* get a list of unlocked mount breed IDs from the API, you cannot as far as I can tell determine that, of the three griffon breeds I've unlocked, I've chosen to use the Starbound.
---
* Map Completion. Again, the individual character API route doesn't seem to contain information on what areas of the map you've completed.
---
* Jumping Puzzle completion, and other stuff that "resets". You *may* be able to glean this from the `/account/achievements` API by cross-referencing the achievement ID and checking to see if it's in the list of complete achievements. For your information, vanilla Jumping Puzzles are part of category 14 (so  [https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/achievements/categories/14](https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/achievements/categories/14)  shows all of them), but this does *not* include any jumping puzzles released after Not So Secret (you'll have to find the IDS for those on your own)
---
* More stuff?
---
As far as your question about **build templates**, that's a bit of a difficult question. The GW2 (and as it so happens, GW1) build templates are Base64 encodings of hexadecimal (hex) IDs and flags, that are themselves encoding decimal information. Lemme break that down before I continue:
---
* Base64 and Hexadecimal are basically numbering systems. In normal, everyday speak, we hear of either *decimal* (using digits 0-9) or *binary* (on/off, yes/no, 1/0) numbering systems. I won't go into the  full math here, but suffice it to say that converting between the three is not exactly the easiest thing in the world.
---
* This is even more complicated by the fact that the hexadecimal codes are often stored in what is known as Little-Endian format, where the *least significant bytes are "listed" first*. Confused? So am I, so I'm not even going to tackle this part of it yet.
---
Next, there's the issue that the build codes don't actually seem to store, for example, skill IDs. The ID of Litany of Wrath (a Guardian heal), for example, is 21664. In other words, if you go to `https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/skills/&lt;someId&gt;` and replace `&lt;someId&gt;` with 21664, you'll get this skill. *But that's not how the templates represent them!* Instead, they seem to represent them as, according to the wiki, "internal skill palette IDs"   (which I take to mean some reference to their position on the drop-down (drop-up?) list that shows when you go to select a skill. 
---
If someone else feels like writing a template generator, obviously it's doable, but it's definitely a bit of a pain to do.
---
Devs. I used that word properly. With the restructuring in February a lot of non-dev stuff was rolled into NCSoft West. While we don't have concrete numbers right now, back in the lul between HoT and LWS3 they released concrete numbers of 220 developers. In the years after they balooned up to 400+.
---
But at least that was fun.
---
Greatsword Berserker is quite good, Arcing Slice gets upgraded to Arc Divider, which hits everything in a massive area for a good chunk of damage with a lower cooldown and Adrenaline cost than Arcing Slice.
---
Also any Warrior can use the Phalanx Strength/Forceful Greatsword combination which will easily fill the Might-granting role.
---
I don't know whether either of these builds are great for raids or T4/CM fractals, but for just about anywhere else you will do just fine. If you play Phalanx Strength in open world, especially with some way to grant Fury (For Great Justice! in particular) everyone around you will love you.
---
same xP
---
no way to get that codes in austria xP
---
They had around 400 devs, until the snap happened.
---
bruh literally tell her she gets to play fantasy hero dress-up. I'm not kidding. Get her into fashion wars, the rest will sort itself out.
---
ty, I just looked up a nice berserker build that works with GS / Axe Axe
---
:)
---
Damn thats mess up im speechless
---
&gt; Finally, in regards to the 2015 HoT credits comparison, that number very clearly includes non-development parts of ArenaNet. I see entries for Customer Support, Localization, [...]
---
It's 500 people if you include Customer Suppot, Localization and other non development departments. 300 were developers (artists, designers, engineers and producers).
---
I liked Aegis juggling in the last boss in the tokyo tower at the end of the TSW story.
---
This system looks different, though, in that you don't grind 3 pieces of gear forever and swap them on demand, but just kill some mooks to grab stacks.
---
If they add more mastery levels to this every release, that's when I'll worry about going the Aegis grind route.
---
Anet hasn't been a small indie studio in a long, long time. People circlejerk about 'unnamed projects' a lot, but we have no idea how much of a drain these really were. We also don't know if the huge parent companies of FF, ESO or WoW allow for a more focused development while Anet may or may not had to cannabilize their own game to get other stuff started.
---
Sidenote: a company without additional projects is a dead company, so there is no question about whether Anet should work on other stuff in addition to GW2 or not.
---
The biggest difference between GW2 and the other games, as far as I can tell, is the amount of work and effort put into their releases. Anet releases MAJOR, fucking HUGE updates every 3-4 months. Because the internet is retarded, we have the "2 hours of content every 3 months hurrdurrimfunny" meme, but that nonsense has no basis in reality.
---
In addition to shittons of content, the overall quality and detail is much larger. Turtles laying eggs and hatchlings hatching, everything completely voiced, actual, dynamic events that are happening instead of a static, simple world with quest text and a bunch of wolves standing over there doing nothing but 'attacking' this farmers sheep, so you have to go kill them and bring back five tails, blah, blah, blah.
---
It probably devours immense amounts of resources.
---
Then add to that Anet's weird 2006 engine that's being held together by voodo and duct tape and the blood and tears of their software engineers that they have to work around all the time.
---
[Here is a nice example of how GW2's extra level of detail and effort makes the 'simple' additions of more races so much more work than at lower-effort games.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/desjnb/anet_adding_new_races_would_be_too_hard_blizzard/f2yyuj5/)
---
Thank you! I did go back and edit that part, as I had missed the distinction in my first glance at the graphic.
---
Could also be a human in light armor with bunny ears from the gemstore.
---
No, it's also on you. You claim I am wrong. Prove it.
---
But the dumb thing is, you are ignoring my larger point to bicker about only one very specific thing. I am talking about an issue that has been talked about in the community for *years*, this excuse about resources I've been reading and hearing for *years*, not just in the last few months.
---
But of course, it's much easier to ignore all that.
---
I find it baffling that they put so much effort into so much awesome, unique stuff used only in solo content that only gets seen once.
---
FF14 saves almost all of that type of stuff for the group content.
---
I don't have to prove anything before you prove your opening claim.
---
Again, we are talking about comparing it to being worth buying a new character slot for.  So it doesn't matter how many character you have, buying a slot is equal to *one* character.  *Just one*.
---
In such scenrio the armor skins, weapon skins, and wardrobe unlocks are not factored in, becuase if one is debating deleing a character or buying a new slot that means they have *other characters*  Thus they get all of these bonuses even if they don't buy said character slot.
---
So it's the dye, 5 teleports each year for one character, 2 statuettes each year for one character, 5k karma a year for one character, and 2 24 hours boosters for one character, being compared to the value of 10 dollars.
---
Which for some is worth it some not.  If it is that would justify buying every character slot you can for your account.  I just wanted to correct you because you keep bringing up other stuff that would not actually factoring in if a slot is worth it alone for birthday gifts.
---
seriously. it's apparent that there is so much talent at anet, but the direction still doesn't really know what it wants to be after seven years
---
power reaper is out of fractal meta for like half year.
---
You do realize I had a much larger point to make. You gonna keep ignoring that? K, bye.
---
Idk. I feel like dps is generally more popular in MMOs, so having a more diversified field in that area than in support makes the most sense, strictly speaking.
---
Precisely what I am talking about
---
Depends on what you want. For a full experience, you'll need them all. If you only want the mounts, you're good with S4.
---
Some are extremely good farm maps, others have great skins or gimmicks and gizmus, others again have mounts or, like I said, an additional downed skill.
---
So, before you know what you should get, you should know what you *want*.
---
As I said, unless you prove your claim, you cant demand others to prove the opposite. You started with your personal assumptions, grow some balls and admit it. Your first post is written in a factual manner, while its not.
---
But then we also read about spaghetti code being unreadable thus many things can't be fixed (ie: UI)? Isn't this the developers' job?
---
Maybe they don't work their devs long hours ?
---
No, I fully understand that elite specs take a lot of work. But it says in the blog post that they spent months designing and developing this mastery, and I personally I think it would have been better used on elite specs instead (assuming they're not currently in development, which is likely given that the season's in full swing and we've heard nothing about them). Back when they promised expansion-grade features for season 5, I think it's safe to say most people didn't expect a brand new combat subsystem.
---
&gt; Q: 1,200+ people make this games but only 300 devs?
---
&gt; The credits of GW2 (HoT) look similar: 500 people. 300 were developers (artists, designers, engineers and producers).
---
How is 500 similar to 1200+?
---
&gt; Well, between the expansion releases people still spend around 4-6 million USD on GW2 each month. Equal to several hundred thousand active subscriptions.
---
That's at least an order of magnitude less than WoW, so don't say they had the same resources.
---

Find another game to play with her that requires less investment.  One of the reasons that MMO's are declining is because they require significant time investments relative to faster paced games.
---
&gt; 2007 on the GW2 side:
---
&gt; 140 full-time developers on Guild Wars AND Guild Wars 2...
---
GW1 got abandoned in 2007 for GW2, they had a live team of ~10 people from then on. So about 130 working on GW2.
---
The people responsible for developing the old code are long gone and can't help with modifying it anymore. Touching it would require a re-write from the ground up to make things readable and compliant with new systems, which means a lot of work-hours and money invested in... exactly copying an existing system that already works as-is. It's more profitable to leave the old systems where they are and make new ones... though kicking something out the door and immediately abandoning it isn't good, either.
---
Fuck New Content,  Bring Updates for Performance upgrade and Improve your servers. here we are sitting with pc's that give 120+FPS in ultra in AAA games and here in GW2 I barely get 40fps in constant
---
I just don't recognize the event I've done so many times... 
---
Five minutes to find the zealots is not a pain for me. 
---
Five groups to dps/cc in phase 2 = fast and easy. 
---
And last phase is just like training on the Golem. Always been this way in third phase.
---
800 gems are 300 gold, and you only need one character to get it, you cant sell it since the Birthday based dyes are account bound.
---
BTW, MAT isn't exactly a common acronym to people outside of PvP - because that's just the state of pvp in the game now.  
---
Also, no idea what ruptbot.exe is - so if that's a gw2 specific bot then you should probably give that context when posting a meme to the sub (but then again, that could/would get your post removed)
---
Core game is free. You will loose nothing by trying it for a few hours.
---
I got it from the outfit voucher from the dragon fall drop pack, just because I thought we'd be going snowy soon. Glad I was right.
---
Sounds not just boring but confusing too. This is what we're getting instead of an expansion with new elite specs? My last hope for this game is dead.
---
Exactly. I'd have to play a map enough to unlock the ability to convert it, but then I would have a choice of playing that map more, or convert currencies from another map at a penalty. 
---
I would imagine that there'd be some new "generic" currency they'd add, and each map would get a different currency exchange. So you might get 3pts per Kralk Ore, but 10pt for Mistonium. (and then spend 6pts for K.Ore, 20pt for Mistonium, etc).
---
Without the central currency, it'd just become a massive mess with converting everything to everything. But I would love to not have go do RIBA runs, because Astralaria needs 1000 crests.
---
Exactly. My point is that it's not only mismanagement but also bad coding practices at the time and maybe lack of talent now to understand the old code.
---
Yeah I might not even know what I want :). Right now I’m just enjoying exploring the world and leveling with my wife and son. Thanks again for the helpful responses.
---
They have no vision. If Mike Z in interview tells that after 7 years they still don't know, if they want to do expansions or not, I have no words. There is no hope.
---
GW2 will never die, thanks to its non-gear focused progression. So go ahead. Its a very nice mmo to focus on for thousands of hours, and when a "new" mmo comes out (like New World or AoC in 1-3 years), you can keep on playing gw2 on the side without any trouble at all.
---
Ppl are downvoting you, same as me. I just don't understand how they can't see the connection here. :D and you are right, btw. :)
---
Happens to me everytime I try to buy something late at night. I just wait until the following morning and it works fine
---
Who the fuck is Glenna?
---
I simply was really satisfied with the settings it picked before the change and wondered what might cause a significant tune down despite using a new graphics card.
---
I have awful luck, I bough them all last week...
---
It's the very definition of "busywork".
---
I was just confused at first about the intended meaning.
---
Once I realized, I figured I'd comment so others might not be initially confused.
---
they do have the same ressources if the dev teams are comparable in size.  
---
everything else doesn't matter much. since the team is already that big, they got a high enough budget from ncsoft to pay the devs &amp; keep the servers running including maintenance etc.  
---
the only thing anet has to do is to develop enough shit so people pay money since ncsoft expects a certain return.
---
The developers need to be allowed the time and space by the managers to refactor the code.
---
It's always never made a priority in my experience - they always want new shinies being developed cos that's where they see the money at higher up.
---
Yeah god forbid they develop core skills further. Instead lets go for overcomplicated arcade style skills hidden behind a grind which will be forgotten when they move onto a new 'saga'.
---
This sounds interesting, although it was a minor faceplant that they named them "Vigilance, Resilience, and Valor." Two "Vs" in there. You want to have three distinct letters so that they are easier to communicate. "use V, use V!" "Which V?" "Va!"
---
Even outside of communication, people will get Vigilance and Valor subconsciously confused more often than if they had different letters to start. It's just bushleague bad design. 
---
Also, I don't like this idea of having to build up stacks of things by killing enemies. It seems like the Siren's Landing mechanic, only more annoying, combined with the stacking Rune buffs, which they got rid of because those were annoying too. It sounds like something that will be highly useful in massive zergs, where you'll be fighting dozens of these enemies and just piling up buffs, but pointless in open solo roaming scenarios, where you might not kill 30 enemies over your entire time playing. 
---
I hope there are no points where progression will be gated behind having to grind out 30 kills to activate your "Essence." . .
---
Ugh.
---
How about they move the devs who developed these masteries into the system team so we can actually get decent resources devoted to core combat skills and maybe get new elites.
---
\&gt; the free story episodes between expansions 
---
They were free for those players who logged in while the story was active. New players have to buy the episodes.
---
Communities are individuals.
---
I'd say that's also just mismanagement in the end. Ignoring technical debt incurs very real costs, both in excess dev time (to work around broken/missing features) and opportunity costs (some features might be shelved outright due to bad code).
---
Sweeping reworks and rebuilds of the code are something management should plan for when the need arises, rather than letting it all fester.
---
Part of me is excited for this, but the cynic in me is wondering if this is why we finally got build templates and why they monetized them so hard. If this system is in any way enhanced by gear, suddenly a lot of people that never used templates might actually need to and might drop cash on it.
---
But it does sound interesting, and I was wondering how they were going to add another aspect of mastery on par with gliding and mounts. This seems pretty decent and I'm looking forward to trying it.
---
Now I have to survive grad school finals long enough to have time to seriously play again over break lol.
---
Would love one, if you have extra :) Either way, thanks for posting!
---
Not really. It's about balancing. The core problem HoT had was not "enemies too tough," it was "enemies too tough, standing right in the middle of the only forking road forward." 
---
It was all about placement. Some players like challenging content, some don't. It's good to include challenging content in the world, it's back to funnel everyone into it. Challenging enemies should be off the beaten path, off to the side where you don't have to engage with them unless you want to, and then reward players who choose to. 
---
PoF largely fixed this by including mounts that can essentially bypass any content players don't want to fight.
---
Anyone else cottoned onto the fact that the way this system works is the same way the profession swap mechanic worked in WvW for that 1 week. Clearly they see WvW as just a testing ground for PvE.
---
That's a good idea.  I think it would be also nice if they introduced true scaling on events.  So that you can solo events like Jade in BF.  
---
As it is, I usually rush when a ls is released just to find any large zerg type stuff and rush to finish it before the map empties.  I rather take my time and explore.
---
&gt;  Yes, it was stated that this was unsustainable, but even if we had a fraction of that now, the game would be so much better.
---
I mean, maybe that's why they switched to the current system? It's certainly not perfect by any measure, but they went from adding stuff to existing maps at breakneck speed that was clearly unsustainable to adding whole maps (which is pretty huge work) at a more sustainable rate.
---
Was there a sweet in-between? Probably, and from what they've said about the Icebrood Saga it definitely sounds like they're at least willing to try and attain it. But OTOH, acting as if LS1 was anywhere near reasonable content production rate is very ignorant - and wrong.
---
Please stop making Fractals and raids. That's all, I don't have any orders beyond that, do whatever else you want to do.
---
They're providing us with three different colors of kamahameha.
---
its not about they are good, once again its about representation. If people see more women in politics, the idea make its place in their brain, just like an habit, irs sadly how psychology works.
---
Its pretty late here, i'll give you an answer for the rest tomorrow
---
Figuring out how to get to a certain area with your masteries is far more interesting than just not getting a reward because you don't have the right mastery leveled.
---
The difference is, the overwhelming majority of GW2 players do not raid or dungeon, so investing heavily in those areas would not be a good use of resources.
---
Nothing in GW2 is "good for much," in terms of rewards. That's not to say that there's not a ton of fun content, of course. But playing for rewards is not the best way to play. The best way to play is to pick a thing: collection, achievement, legendary item, PvP rank, etc. that you find personally interesting, and work towards that in your free time.
---
the water has actual waves for some reason. But only out of the map borders
---
Hmm so $US 30 for Standard. $US 35 for 2800 gem package.
---
Thank you :&gt; wasn't really looking for rewards just fun stuff to do when story is driving me crazy. After listening to people I think WvW sounds fun.  I was working on building Mawdry but it takes so much blood stone haha
---
More power creep...
---
Still waiting on my Rurik stance greatsword Revenant, so here’s hoping
---
Really wish you could gift these to friends.
---
Ugh please no. Keeping unique and especially lore-related stuff behind needing 9 other people is horrible. And not just 9 other people, but 9 other people who are skilled enough to clear the raid, have enough time and similar schedules to do it. At least like now, it can work amazingly as a mean single-player game with social functions for people who have trouble socializing or dedicating tons of time.
---
Even WoW realized this, and started including LFR mode for all raids that automatically searches for an entire raid of queued people and the difficulty is on strike-boss level.
---
That's mostly because ANet's difficulty curve sucked. People complained about HoT's difficulty because nothing pre-HoT really tested your build. You went straight from trivial base game content to getting rekt by pocket raptors.
---
I haven't played for 5 years. Just activated yesterday and bought the fire expansion. No idea what living world seasons I have available
---
Inb4 your thingy gets blocked because Anet is working on official gw2 VR (but only for 1 eye - unlock VR for 2nd eye by purchasing item from gem store) ;)
---
Who is talking about a raid? Again, a certain MMO has been doing it for years and they seem to be just fine..?
---
No. Wait for gw3. :D lul
---
&gt; You are not comparing GW2 and WoW. You are comparing ArenaNet and WoW.
---
No, that would be Anet: __500__ - WoW: __230__ (in 2015).
---
&gt; Also, you are not listing the specific roles. 'Devs' is a very generic term, and not everyone can fulfill the same roles.
---
&gt; ArenaNet is mostly artists. Tons of artists. 
---
__FFXIV__ 2017: Engineers: __60__, Artists: __128__
---
__GW2__ 2015: Engineers: __85__ (94), Artists: __99__ (107)
---
numbers: (if you include Leads)
---
Anyone know where to even plug this in? Gem store code section?
---
They are hideously inefficieint, always have been and what you've pinpointed is one of the reasons why I've said so and continue to say so.
---
No the other staff were on top of the 300 working on GW2.
---
It's from the Extra Life special event the other week. Unfortunately there was some sort of bug when they took it down and until it gets patched the star is stuck pinned.
---
This one seems to be useful in more than one map since they mentioned there will be another tier. This is miles better than mastery from LS3E6 which was used only on one map.
---
Anet has a fetish for gating things in some way because they can’t design content with longevity in mind.
---
&gt; Meanwhile, in GW2 one of the raid wings was postponed for several months because the VO wasn't done
---
And when it was done it was postponed even further to release it with the living world episode.
---
Is that the charged quartz crystal? It was a bit of a pain I guess, fortunately had some saved up. Always seem to be needed for something
---
Because some of us have seen this before and know what the artist drew, shocking I know.   
---
It's pretty pathetic you don't even know what your posting
---
Better yet, move the janitors over to the art team! They know a lot about dirt and grime, they'd be great at textures! /s
---
Hardly.
---
It always start with "we will keep it clean this time". And then there is death march because there is come demo coming, milestone to make, release date etc.
---
There just no time to keep it clean. It's hacks upon hacks, to deliver the demo with new features and as polished as possible, because that's where the management see money. It doesn't matter if it will be maintainable in long run.
---
You can't, it's a bug probably. It will go away with next update (Tuesday).
---
ty for the fast answer. i came back to the game yesterday after a year break and was wondering what it could be
---
Sorry, yes I should have specified. I was thinking in terms of upcoming ones, not past ones.
---
No it’s not. 
---
Guild Wars is probably largely doing its own infrastructure which WoW doesn’t have to worry about. 
---
Infra/Ops Teams can be another 50% more engineers which if GW2 runs its own ops means it has half the resourcing of WoW if not less.
---
&gt; The biggest difference between GW2 and the other games, as far as I can tell, is the amount of work and effort put into their releases. Anet releases MAJOR, fucking HUGE updates every 3-4 months. Because the internet is retarded, we have the "2 hours of content every 3 months hurrdurrimfunny" meme, but that nonsense has no basis in reality.
---
Actually it does, the content updates are generally a lot of sound and fury signifying not much except on the rare occasion. Clearly a lot of work goes into each LS update yet for the majority of players it literally is only 3 or s hours of content every 3 months at maximum. This is partly where they are so inefficient, focusing the majority of their resources on the wrong areas. 
---
What I'm saying is probably similar to what you're getting at but you're framing it as a positive when it isn't, its an indicator of their inefficiency and poor management.
---
They seem to tone down. Oakheart's Essence is arguably the most unique one since it involves getting around the map. You can play without mastery tied to specific LS map but with this one? Oh boy, good luck (before mounts happened).
---
B&amp;S is a lot more P2W in Asia, so...
