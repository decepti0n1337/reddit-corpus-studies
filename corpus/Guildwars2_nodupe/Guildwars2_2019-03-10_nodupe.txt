Current business model would be more efficient if anet didn't abandon most of gw2 development in favor of now cancelled projects. Game needs an expansion every 12-18 months with LW patches every 2 months. At least 2 raids and fractals per year and significant development increase in pvp and wvw areas.
---

---
However... that was also true in 2016. So question is, is it worth to invest more into ald game or just start the new project at this point.
---
Welllll aetherblade isn‚Äôt as much as a face roll as the other two paths... but yeah, they easy. Not to mention, doing 8 diff paths (stories included) will net you a chest of 150 of any dungeon token 
---
Mirage doesnt affect zerg fights at all, especially not as condi. Pretty sure that no roaming build uses antitoxin since there are much better choices.
---
Charr.
---
They're right; people from NA servers aren't able to play with people from EU servers
---
Sometimes people do this to contest capture points. The other case I can think of is when someone is trying to waypoint out but has been stuck in combat due to being hit.
---
how can an argument be lowercase?
---
I‚Äôd say bring a pchrono still. CS+TW for bosses is plenty, and the focus pull can help on some bits. Also the burst is nice, and for TA up, the feedback can help if you don‚Äôt have enough burst.
---
There are dialogue variations that include references to your race and profession throughout though they are still pretty rare. Even some stuff responds to your story choices. Almost all of it is just super small acknowledgements that don't change anything though. If you gave me the specific story step I could look up the text in question too. 
---
You can party up between NA &amp; EU, but you can‚Äôt join each other‚Äôs instances.  That‚Äôs just how the game servers work.  No need to get so hostile at random people.
---
They absolutely are. I'm telling you. I have friends in EU servers. We play together all the time. 
---
Ooooh stag looks cool.

Haha it's so funny, thanks for sharing üòÇ

Do we know if there will be any character slot sales soon?
---
I reckon the item you're thinking of is either 1. [Season 4 Portal Tome](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Season_4_Portal_Tome) or 2. [Spearmarshal's Plea](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spearmarshal%27s_Plea).
---
Item 1 requires you to own the respective living world season 4 episodes, then buy the portal scrolls from the volatile magic vendor.
---
Item 2 is normally picked up as part of the griffon quest, but you can pick it up any time by walking to [Spearmarshal's Lament](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spearmarshal%27s_Lament).
---
No wonder nobody wants to play with you LUL
---
Personally I think this would remove the uniqueness of legendaries, many go after them for their aura but there‚Äôs still a sense of legendary-ness considering these weapons are the only places you can get the auras from. 
---
Are you sure they aren't in NA servers? Or maybe you're in EU? https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/23743/cross-server-facts
---
doubt it
---
How long you been playing all together?
---
It's math that determines that is needed in a party composition which is largely determined by raids though. Because we don't generally discuss it for anything else, except T4 fractals perhaps. There's a meta for that too.
---
But by and large, the theory crafters who decide on which meta to accept, those who crunch the numbers, are most often basing their assumptions on a raid group.

---
That's the thing, I'm guessing that is the event I need based on the fact I see no recording on my toon (the only one I've ever bought recorders for. I don't do much PoF map stuff), the assumption the wiki shows the recordings in order of how they get handed over, and that I don't see this event's recording highlighted in the achievement. But I could be wrong because the event and the recording end up with different names.
---
Obviously, warclaws have evolved from some armor collection!
---
Holy shit I didn't even think about shared slot! I have done a couple caffeinated skritt events, but I'm pretty sure I was just farting around on another toon.
---
I want my time back from reading this. It's mostly speculation and it fuels the fear. We don't know how many people now are working on Guild Wars 2 as before the layoffs. No clue. No idea. None.
---
As for the comment about people starting the game, content updates for them would be the least important because there's a TON of stuff to do before you actually reach the stage where you'll be waiting for the next update.
---
New players aren't sitting on reddit waiting for the next update to drop with nothing to do in the meantime. Plenty for those players to sink their teeth into.
---
Thanks, boosting a character only to take the raptor it's exactly what I did, but I forgot to take the glide... Guess I'll take it next time.

Also, to actually address the meat of your comment: The emboldened refugee event I've probably never done. I will definitely be on the lookout for this one and it's hydra
---
Open world is the best thing in this game, you don't have to be good or follow metabuilds or know pretty much anything, just follow a comm tag, try to enjoy the game at its best.  
---
Trying raids is not for everyone (less than 5% play so don't worry about it).   
---
PvP is really toxic and should be avoided in your situation, if you enjoy killing other people you should try WvW, pretty much like Open world, follow a commander, get in a discord, have fun and enjoy playing PvP at its best. (For WvW you are better try to get some good builds though for your class in order to be more effective and not die in 2 seconds).
---
Piece of advice: If you do end up rolling a longbow ranger, for the love of christ think about when you use the longbow knockback so you don't push things out of people's AoE or melee range. Your groupmates and random open world pugs will think of you as a god.
---
Scrapper is still not gonna be viable in pve raids though they should see better performance in Fractals.
---
For PvP, they might require more balance to fit in nicely but so far they stomp on Mirages/Scourges/Rangers so I'm pretty happy with that. 
---
But in the end, Scrapper will never escape the Support role for serious PvE content because of the fact that their strong suit is specifically supporting and bunkering. 
---
And I think it's fine that way. 
---
Maybe Jormag looks like a Swan?
---
Or maybe Svanir looked like he was a Swan with a long ass nose?
---
On the flip side, before Scrapper's rework, Scourges were just overly dominant by simply converting boons and applying layers of debilitating conditions to enemies, especially in a PvP setting where players are forced to fight for point control and have no alternative other than to rotate. 
---
Scrappers can be seen as a direct counter to Conditions but of course they need tuning so that other forms of pressure can easily punish them for running a heavily focused anti condi build. 
---
I'll have to check next time I'm in game. I'm doing LW Season 2 if that helps.
---
I did notice, and love, the acknowledgements I got from other Charr that referenced the very early character story in my level 70 and 80 story lines. 
---
I can understand that... but I‚Äôm kinda with this person! I‚Äôd love a checkbox on legendary weapons to turn on and off the aura. Like, I love the look of bolt, but maybe sometimes I don‚Äôt want the aura on. On the other hand, I‚Äôd love the aura of bolt, but with a diff skin!
---
Also, FIX CHARR AND AURA SIZE!
---
You can just buy trophy shipments only with volatile magic and gold

You're right. You should stop playing.
---
The base content is still great and easily a step above the leveling process for almost all other MMOs. However, the expansion content is SO GOOD that the base content is looked on badly by current players, including myself for the longest time until I started over with a friend who was new to the game. The most obvious things you'll be missing out on are gliders, mounts, and living world content.

Perfect example in [Prosperity's Mystery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prosperity%27s_Mystery) is season 2. When talking about steam creatures with her:
---
&gt;Taimi: This steam creature may have been her prototype. It has...flaws.
---
&gt;Player: What do you mean...flaws?
---
&gt;Taimi: Oh, I couldn't possibly explain it in terms you would understand. You'll just have to trust me on it.
---
&gt;Player: If you say so.
---
**(If an engineer):**
---
&gt;Taimi: Look closely with your engineering eyes on. Do you see the way its gears are seated so awkwardly and the primitive configuration of its mechamagical structure?
---
&gt;Player: Yes, I see what you mean. I haven't used that configuration since my first apprenticeship.
---
**If speaking to her as an asura:**
---
&gt;Well, I have to admit I am a bit disappointed. Look at the way its gears are seated, and the primitive configuration of its magical structure.
---
&gt;Player: Yes, I see. You must remember that this was her early work.
---
&gt;Taimi: But I was making golems like this when I was still a toddler.
---
&gt;Player: She is sylvari. We are asura. There are inherent differences, you know?
---
&gt;Taimi: I suppose she gets some credit because she was never a toddler.
---
&gt;Player: Very astute of you.

Sometimes I get baited by the commander because he decides he doesn't want to commit or sees something I don't but I get so blinded by setting up my skills and maneuvering against the enemy because I thought we initiated that I don't even notice the sudden retreat.
---
Still would love to play on a strict Iron Man server in GW2. Imagine running around and seeing someone kitted out in a full set of dungeon armor, you'd know you just spotted a bad ass. I know GW2 is fairly kick back but damn what I wouldn't give to see an MMO with this quality combat system take things to another level.
---
Haha, imagine taking away the downstate too - everyone would be on edge! Jesus imagine something like the SW meta but it actually having consistently good drops. Octo would regularly drop QB infusion and Ascended armor that negated level scaling. 
---
If you had a full set of this gear, and walked into a starting zone - YOU could literally save the day! Hard champ people are afraid to tag? Not a big deal, you can handle it because you risked life and limb against the Octo for your Ascended set. 
---
Imagine seeing people drop as you fight alongside them, you'd actually FEEL something! Especially if that person was risking a high level character. Hell, better yet there ONLY character! The default character menu is just one portrait - YOUR ONLY CHARACTER. 
---
The aesthetics of the game could change as well, perhaps instituting a darker soundtrack and applying a gloomy ReShade(esque) effect. An entire mood shift! Oh shit, racial abilities to boot! Norn, S tier Warriors. Asuran's, S tier Engi's. Sylvari, S tier spinach!
---
We are all shitheads on this blessed day.
---
Oh cool! Does make me want to play through as an Asura. I really loved the super early Asura zone quests where the Asura got very complicated options for the golems and my charr toon got things like "rip out the yellow wire." 
---
You‚Äôre missing raids, masteries, new maps, new legendaries, most farming spots except Silverwastes, etc
---
You‚Äôre basically missing the end game. The core game is pretty much forgotten at this point asides from world completion
---
You're entitled to your opinion so I don't see why anyone should bother 
---
When you're underwater, your skills activate faster than above water. (Applies mainly to utility skills) Some classes *are just flat out better* when it comes to underwater damage. For example, ranger can self-sustain 25 stacks of might and full fury and swiftness in about 3 seconds. A tempest ele can have absurd damage just using overloads. (My friend has completed T4 underwater fractals without any underwater weapons on a tempest. He did ok, but not terribly). 
---
You're going to want to focus mostly on your spear underwater. Your 2 and 5 are good damage. Your 4 is a block combo with damage. Your 3 is CC. Your auto attacks are ok. Your burst ability is meh. For your Harpoon gun, the only good ability on it is your 5 skill.
---
So ideally, banners&gt;Harpoon gun 5&gt;swap&gt;5-2-1-burst-111+-2-111+-5, etc. Throw in some other blocks and necessary CCs and you're great.
---
I need this, how to do it?

The gems that come with expacs and special editions usually have a built-in wait time to prevent charge back scams.

---
&gt;It's a reaction to the blatant power creep out there. I'm not a fan but that's the direction the game has gone. Why did things go from applying one or two main conditions
---
Because condis need to be as good as power. Before HoT, most condi build were utter useless, nobody used ANY aside from a condi engineer build with grenades which ended up getting nerfed a lot. There is way too many condi clean to delegate 1 or 2 main condis.  I remember trying to make a condi sword warr work back then and i just couldn't, because by the time i applied a few bleed to deal an auto worth of power, i could have killed my opponents 10 times over with power instead.
---
I'm not trying to say scourge and mirage splurting a million condis on you is good either, but you can't say the power one shots or the boon overload isn't an issue that is just as worse. All this condi spam that happened over pof and hot was actually a direct response to power "powercreep" lol
---
Long time WvWer. This thing is pure joy. It feels so good. ü§©
---
One of my favorite JP ever made.
---
I think you are right in theory but in practice i think its way more fun this way.
---
Fights last longer now and you can even push sometimes. This leads to a more positive result no matter of you win or loose.
---
Nobody likes to get rolled but if you got beaten after a few mins of back and forth both sides will feel more like it was a good fight.
---
Also in practice there are no condi builds that it invalidated. The only viable oner before the run was cele scourge. And the only one after is still cele scourge. There aren't really condi builds that only do condi in wvw.
---
Ya wanna know how bad it is for charr???? I spent like 6 years playing, and didn‚Äôt know that twilight/dawn had AURAS!!! Legit, did not know of it EVER!!!! You can‚Äôt see it! Not to mention the raid armor aura is basically nonexistent!

One thing that helped me when I first got my tag was learning to use the [Markers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Commander#Location_and_Object_markers).

Super helpful for various things such as marking Vinetender spawns for Dragon's Stand runs, or doors in Labyrinth for Mad King, or whatever you would want to use them for really. 
---
I am honestly able to manage with only the 3 base tabs, but I bought an extra one a while ago. I use a tab and a half currently just to store rare/exotic weapons I collect until I have enough to put them in mystic toilet, and have another 15-25 open spaces for when I switch gear for my weekly key farm run that otherwise stay empty. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just buy extra character slots for cheaper, more storage space, and you can play them. The shared inventory slots are awesome too. I have 11, so that's 10 or so slots that would be in the bank otherwise.
---
Inb4 rytlock brimstone warclaw mount skin 2000 gems
---
Oh yea I will definitely do that. Thanks for the tip
---
Finally we have a viable support besides firebrand in wvw. I think there this is all upside.
---
They can change bulwrak gyro to scale with players in range so it gives you almost no barrier when you are solo. 
---
This makes scrapper bunkers less annoying and easier to kill in PvP but keeps the WvW functionality the same.
---
Yea pugging raids is definitely on the todo list

Yeah, this. Was keeping it as simple as possible

I believe it was reset with the addition of Diviner's gear to WvW and PvE

This basically.
---
Condis on a Zerg scale practically don't exist because of the fact that they simply get washed away by Firebrands or Scrappers.
---
It's more on a roaming basis would yu wanna run this rune and even then, people run Leadership instead for boonduration and conversion if they really needed the cleanse.
---
There is really no reason both chronos should need moa unless you're doing like a six man run.
---
Personally am not a fan of having to carry all the cc for the DPS but thats a personal thing.
---
But if we did fine with 0 moa before it should be do able.Its nice to have the option to bring a moa though .
---
Bringing at least one two makes the boons smoother and being able to run a lot lower BD allows our dps greed to go on :D
---
Theres also disenchanter which you can take instead of mimic, you lose 4 signets for one cs so if you get BD to compensate for that you're fine and you can out DPS half the DPS players in lfg.

Not running tw really puts a wrench in that.

See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Well the most prominent known places to farm gold are already mentioned but there are some more things you can do, mainly one time daily activities:
---
\-First of all log in every single day even if you don't play at all at this day
---
\-Second, get a friend with a full home instance (especially one with all eleven living story nodes unlocked) and ask him daily for access
---
\-Third, gather your guild hall - possibly multiple ones in different stages of completion
---
\-Fourth, craft your daily ascended crafting materials (while the materials are not that expensive anymore due to lower costs of materials since pof the cd is still worth quite some gold)
---
\-Fifth, get your daily two gold via daily achievements. Especially of you are harvesting a home of a friend you will have 1/3 already done. Often it takes less then 10 minutes to complete three daily achievements.
---
\-Sixth, event rotations (HOT-Metatrain for amalgamated gemstones is the most prominent one but your "income" will depend on how much you play those maps outside of the metas. Tangled depths is the best example. The potential material gain from one meta is huge but heavily depends on the amounts of keys you have. - on a pre event finished map you can easily burn through 80-90 keys during one metaevent as well as the around 15 minutes waiting period before the meta will start. There are others rotations constantly evolving but some of them are to niche to get them always going via lfg. A guild or at least a couple of good friends are needed but than you can easily create your own rotation if you are not reliant on the help of the lfg.)
---
\-Seventh, Festivals. There is not always one active, but with five currently featured festivals you will have nearly every second month one running. Next one is the SAB festival where you can get one of the most expensive buffed foods ingame as well as some pretty expensive weapon skins.
---
\-Eighth, make use of lesser or unplayed toons and park them at jumping puzzle chests (most prominent ones are at the end of the jackal puzzle at crystal oasis - once per account per day - or at the end of the jp of draconis mons - once per character per day) or at gardens (draconis mons or verdant brink flax garden or the kudzu garden if you have finished the collection for the precursor)
---
Every method on its own will not give that much but some of them combined will reward you with plenty of gold in a relatively short amount of active gametime. After these one time daily acitivities you can still run already mentioned champ trains or meta trains on specific maps till night time and beyond.
---
In that case yes, it makes sense to buy some now that there's a sale and hoard them until the inevitable cap increase.
---
No, Duh. It's clearly a bird. Can't you see the wings...
---
Haha yea thanks
---
Noted, thanks for the info
---
it is my go-to-mount for inner-city travel.
---
or.....perhaps the warclaws are what the charr become........
---
but the exalted are human souls in armour, same with the forged, souls in armoured form.......why not have the warclaws be charr souls, they already live for endless war and fighting already and they do look REALLY similair
---
You still can make use of the stunbreak elite + MI + resist on engage. Plus for guilds you can get a quick triple blast for stealth (if you don't have enough scrappers), and stab and aegis are still no joke. 
---
1 FB per 10 could be the future, but fb/scrapper 5 man parties are the easy way out anyway.
---
Great job ! Jumping puzzles need more love !
---
Very important question coming..... Are you named after the Cadbury jaffas?
---
Why be charr souls and not cat souls? Or just souls made from the Mists and Magic like the sand jackals?
---
They don't look that similar imo. The similarity ends at "giant feline". At that might as wrll proclaim jackals have giganticus lupicus souls or that Awakened Canids are not fleshwarped humans but some species of devolved/shrunken GL.
---
It's mostly meant to be cosmetic for pve
---
It is the best for core pve only, non seasonal players. Otherwise there are plenty of spots where you will get similiar or even better results. Especially with not so much narrow time windows. To be honest for most players karma is not that much of a deal as long as you are following some basic rules: get a karmic enrichment for your amulet and if you are running around in pve use karma buffed food from wintersday as well as the karma guild hall buff. After quite some time you will drown in karma. Even if you are constantly crafting legendaries or buying at pact agents. That is the reason why every new karma sink is priced with 100k+ karma per unlock. 
---
For example I am receiving over 1000 karma from every finished level 80 renown heart and a couple hundred karma for every event with gold reward. Combined with karmic retribution buffs for living story maps it only adds up. During wintersday you can get around 100k karma per day by running in divinitys reach for 5-10 minutes (orphan run) but of cause that is seasonal.
---
I honestly don't understand this.
---
It's a WvW ability. That you can even use it in PvE at all is your bonus.
---
Exactly this, and wait no one is gonna complain about it since it's not the mirage :D #fair
---
Well, provided the game exists in two years.

[removed]
---
when gliding and then mounts were released in pve, zones around various jumping puzzles gave you the debuff as not to cheese your way through vanilla gw2 jps. guessing it was pieced over the same way for wvw
---
It's essentially the same route that Anet took with racial skills, which is a bit disappointing, but at least there's nothing enticing me to go out of my way to get it. Though I may regret that in a year's time when I need to venture into wvw to get another gift of battle and everyone but me has a warclaw.
---
Yes
---
Yes!  My favorite as well!
---
I remember seeing data showing the runeforgers being like the worst one.  Being beat by copperfed and mystic/silverfed in every category except low level items.
---
Oh, yes that is true. I forgot it did that.
---
I only have one base tab.  Is there a way to unlock more without buying them?
---
Those are area specific debuffs and make sense.
---
This new WvW debuff is just useless clutter.
---
Dumping out a map - especially a giant map - and all the associated story as a single release.  
---
ANet, I beg of you, set up the maps in stages, internally test all the stages to make sure that everything works and the entire studio doesn't have to be in release crunch mode constantly, and then stagger the enabling of stages over several weeks. Or even, build less but larger maps, split them up, and release parts of them throughout entirely separate LW episodes.  
---
If you really want to commit to the Living World model for the game going forward, the current model, which encourages one giant activity spike on release day and then a sharp drop from there, is not healthy for anything or anyone. I obviously don't have access to your internal metrics, but overall I can see that this model is bad for guilds, bad for players, and probably bad for cash shop revenue.
---
Do NOT let them fix the warclaw jump, there are several spots where you can jump and exploit your way into keeps with normal classes! You can get into both inner keeps in the desert borderlands for example. 
---
Anet knows about those exploits and hasn't fixed them since the map came out. + and - a few weeks because people hadn't found these immediately.
---
I think its Jeff aka the-guy-who-nerfed-Istan
---
Yes it is, getting around faster is good, makes the boring, slow, 2012 gameplay faster and more enjoyable.
---
The only issue I found with it so far is that a complete zerg can be back at the fight way too fast and it makes capturing stuff harder.
---
You should read my response to the other person. I'm not going to repeat myself here.
---
I'm assuming that the bottom right one is Rox?
---
I mean, technically he's right... They do have those little floating square golems in GW2.
---
I read your response. That's why I disagreed with it.
---
I've see 3 cases of this happening on enemies so far and I always saw them on their mount. Maybe it's harder to notice if they aren't on their mount cuz it looks normal.
---
The bugged players also glitched and jittered..
---
Sad part is is that the chain pull does too little damage to be worth the supplies.
---
I use it for its opener. It got the highest opener damage of all mounts. AoE crit of 5k plus bleeding stacks? Yes pls.
---
You are probably right. Still, depending on context i use to do that. But again, you are right.
---
Fhon Ghai from Yuggoth? I've heard of him. ;)
---
Omg thats creepy af
---
I have no idea whether or not the OP is guilty of using a 3rd party app here. Maybe he is - but even if so, what we see here from the GM is the same old problem and shows that nothing has changed. 
---
The entire "we thoroughly investigate every aspect of the situation before we take action" has been proven time and time again, most recently and most notably with that banwave reversal of a couple of months ago and all of the details of it, that this is simply untrue.

As frustrating as it would be, I'd feel far, far better about ArenaNet's discipline system if they said in these replies, "we'd like to look into every aspect of the situation before taking action, but do not have the resources." At least then I'd think they were being forthcoming. When they keep insisting that they investigate all of these suspensions seriously while everybody knows it is not true, it just makes it impossible to trust them.
---
Can share the builds you run for the other classes?
---
https://i.imgur.com/xfHil1C.jpg
---
Cosmetic not enough? 
---
It looks cool and I can imagine the skins spilling out which will rival even Raptor and Jackal skins. 
---
&gt;carving new niches
---
Scrapper and tempest have been massive condi cleanse bots even before the runes, this just enables them more
---
Which builds exactly does it destroy viability for?
---
Why is antitoxin detrimental?  You have provided no argument other than "its too gamebreaking" with zero evidence lol 
---
Tupac vs Lil Pump
---
Gotcha
---
Bye then 
---
Same boat as you, played much GW1, started GW2, finished story and then some. Stopped for years, coming back now, HoT + PoF were all big ??'s, but no trouble with groups and such :) Started level 1, see people in starting areas, and folks are happy to answer questions. Is all G.

I remember reading a developer diary a looooong time ago about how Daniel Dociu, the artist for many of the more abstract concept arts like this one, made a lot of his stuff. (I don't remember the name of the technique, but it's been around as long as photoshop has)
---
He would start off with a dozen stock images, select parts of each image that were interesting, arrange them, and apply a skritt-ton of filters in photoshop. Then, he would paint over the whole thing to create a new image.
---
Sometimes, though, parts of the original stock image composition would remain in the final image. As far as I know, that is the origin of the random guy in between the fences here.
---
What about an warclaw ability to apply a speed boost to unmounted players near you? Like a warcry shout or channeled wardrums
---
I feel that there are so many things ignored in this game that are just swept under the rug and always blamed on third party this and third party that, but the simple fact remains that those things aren't even needed because of how broken some mechanics etc in the game itself are. So I am wondering, either a) the coders do not have time to invest in fixing it, b) they do not know HOW to fix it, c) the engine itself is the limitation in fixing it and the list goes on. I don't know if I can feel invested in something that gets treated in this manner, where ignorance is bliss. Even when OP clearly wants to help them out, they refuse and can't give straight answers. What I can get from this is that they are uninterested in even looking at how to fix it, and just trying to bury it with a suspension.
---
Wow. You manage to come across as a self righteous prick...
---
No, you won't. If you provide evidence about the trade, for example a video recording of your agreement and the trade itself, they can possibly action the scammer, but you will never get your items back.
---
Trading done other than through the trading post is not supported by ArenaNet.
---
If you want to be safe, ask a known middleman over on r/gw2exchange.
---
If the same happened to you, if they're able to create a transmutation splitter for a 2013 transmutation, maybe they can help you as well. I would put in a ticket and submit your video. If you have the skins unlocked on your account and achievement progress, etc, I would at least attempt.
---
If that is true, than this is officially the most retarded thing I have ever heard. Please play it, its milestones ahead of WvW (for first exploration/mount collection)
---
I swear this game full of tumblrs now
---
I'm going to guess that there are no plans to give us the option to hide the aura from Aurora? My own research has yielded nothing more than radio silence from ANet on the matter.
---
I've been grinding out the achievement portion of Aurora over the last few days - I still have a ways to go, but I finally decided to look ahead at the later crafting stages. What I didn't realize it is that it has an aura. I was just browsing my incomplete achievements and it struck my fancy. I had no idea what was waiting for me at the end, so I'm kinda bummed.
---
I could use that time instead to grind out normal ascended trinkets. And I would much rather do that if there's no hope for it going away in the foreseeable future.
---
I can't even think of 1 game that uses a cat style mount.. besides gw2.  Not that I've gone looking anyway..
---
Flat Injustice icon pack. Asura and assorted number of beasts, as predicted (yes, I've noticed Rox).
---
#MCCA make charr, charr again
---
Needs a nerf
---
The hunchback-ness of charr is why I refuse to make one. If they were like gw1 charr I‚Äôd have several but nope. 
---
Wiki has a good page on [all the legendary armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_armor#PvP_Components). In the section below it says it needs a minimum of 3 seasons for the tickets which will take at least 6 months of PvP. You need a total of 180 pips to get the last chest. Wining gives 10 pips, losing gives -3, 1 bonus for getting top stats. Some other minor bonus pips as well and the track resets every season (~2 months). [Lots of good builds](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Conquest), right now scrapper is very strong since the buff as well. Support isn't as much of a thing, since the game is based around area capture. The tanky "bunker" builds are designed to hold their own on points and defend them from capture. Firebrand is a good bunker build, you can defend points and heal others in team fights (though again you normally want to be solo on points). 
---
Why are you so mean? Can't people like different things?
---
If I remember, I will.
---
How is it retarded if you play what you enjoy? 
---
 It's been years since the release of HoT, I just racked up my 27th AB finish.... right there with ya
---
I wouldn't even care about all the hours I put into this game, if they would introduce P2W I would quit without thinking about it.
---
Very few people like depressed individuals. 
---
They can like what ever they want but you must agree, not unlocking raptor and springer is just weird. I imagine a hardcore wvw player like him has everything unlocked from there? why would he not even check out PoF especially since he bought it... I cant wrap my head around it
---
Before JoJo, After JoJo
---
Start with small things. First, participate tag spams at LA. Then go for tagging up for world bosses or events like Eye or capturing Balthazar temple at Orr. Then fill a Tequatl map, lead a VB night assault on Matri, take that squad to TD for any lane and then finish Tarir (tri meta).
---
And after doing all these, one day you may see yourself tagging to give free portals to strangers on top of a JP. 
---
I honestly don't understand why they don't have a face to face trade window where you both put your items in click accept and it does the trade
---
Not unlocking at least Raptor is just punishing yourself.
---
Awesome! Can't even imagine having a physical doll of my main. Job well done. I love his expression!
---
The one on the left will rip your heart out of your chest, using only his clawed hands.  
---
The one on the left will offer you a double moka pumpkin frappuccino, and get offended when you decline and ask for an espresso instead. Will then proceed to cry for a few minutes, complaining about how your lack of manners almost caused an attack of depression, and will then go home and comb the fur.
---
1. Think on regearing your druid to dps soulbeast if you need a character in the meantime to do stuff, but don't sweat it if you still find it unappealing.
---
2. What do you like doing? What turned you off druid?
---
3. Yeah, you have nearly a whole season of stuff/POF to play through. At the very least, come back and give mounts a try, that part turned out real well.
---
They could give the same option as Blizzard did with orcs. Just slap it to total makeover kit and give the ability to either have a straight back or not. However, this is hardly possible, because there is no need to do so, and I guess they would have to play around with how upper armour pieces might have to look.
---
I feel the gw1 charr armors were more deadly looking. Skulls and spikes all over. Thats the main reason i made a charr in gw2... but disappointed with how most armors are made.
---
They always hunched in combat so they could do both.
---
Just off the top of my head from the games I've personally played...
---
[World of Warcraft Cats](https://warcraftmounts.com/gallery.php#Cats)
---
[ESO Felines](https://eso.mmo-fashion.com/mounts/) 
---
FF14 has the Coeurl, Fat Cat, some battle cats I can't find a good link to
---
Pretty sure every mmo I've played or looked at has had at least one cat style mount, they seem pretty popular.
---
It's the Hipstcharr, even the Elder Dragons fear him...
---
Primordius still remembers in horror when he served him a double moka pumpkin frappuccino made with hot coffee instead of warm one, and the crying lasted for so long it was more punishment than even the endless battle with the Dwarves could deal him!
---
While we‚Äôre at it can we bring back charr hide armor?
---
Antitoxin rune isnt entirely the reason condi isnt meta.... 
---
The fact that revs can nuke everything from 1200 range makes power all around more favorable. Really thats about all the dmg you need. Weaver is ok but all they have is meteors every 24sec....
---
Scourge is a different story. They don't put out as many condis anymore (thank god) so people default to power because wells can still hurt and the shade F1 procs have decent dmg.
---
*before the nerf
---
I wanna see how far this crazy comic series can go...
---
Because to most of us WvW main players, pve is boring content and we do not give a shit about the story of the game. There's next to no reason to play story missions unless they give us access to easy/cheap ascended gear 
---
But if you can use it in PvE it should be fun in PvE, it's just wasted potential there.
---
Why are people so against making something fun for both game modes?
---
Thanks I hate it.
---
We may be visiting the gw1 Charr very soon in the Blood Legion Homelands. Maybe Anet keps some of their deadly style :)
---
***SACRIFICE IT TO THE FLAMES OF BAELFIRE!***
---
Upright Charr = Capes
---
Istan farm was insanely easy and rewarding. I was late to the game because as a new player I've been focusing on finishing the story and getting into fractals. I started Istan about two weeks before the nerf. Just doing palawadan and GH I was getting 10g just by instant selling un'id gear at the tp. On top of that I was banking a ton of mats from salvaging all the id'd gear that dropped. You don't really need to do anything, just throw out a few abilities, make sure you tagged the champs and then open the chests and it's GG. 
---
No.
---
And capes would have no excuse not to be made !
---
They are a threat to all peoplekind
---
This game just won't work well for it. Newer content does to an extent (except for fractals since Twilight Oasis which have gone back to more dungeon like trash spam), like Raids, the CM fractals and HoT maps, but most content just wouldn't work. Dungeons rely far too much on enemy spam with terrible telegraphing for this to be a good idea for example. Old content is too cluttered to even see what killed you. In raids and CMs you can clearly see all attacks and react to them, and dying is your own fault. In most older content so much trash is thrown at you that you cannot avoid individual attacks at all anymore and just randomly get blown up. Even worse with instabilities in fractals like TO and SR. 
---
Also, meta events require a lot of people. Finding 5 for fractals or 10 for raids is a cakewalk, but a lot of content will just be totally inaccessible. Find enough people willing to risk their characters for open world metas that suffer from the same issues as dungeons (bad telegraphing etc.). The entirety of HoT would be avoided even though the maps are the best in the game. PoF metas aren't even done at all so they'll be even more avoided.
---
In a lot of games with Ironman what people do is outgear/outlevel content before doing it to make it as safe as possible. That's just not doable in GW2 luckily, but it wouldn't work well for ironman.
---
I felt this.
---
They had it in GW1.
---
To put it shortly: people are dumb - they still got scammed on a daily basis.
---
The TP system not only helps manage the economy, but it also reduces the number of scammed cases significantly.
---
So, about content...
---
Yes it looks remarkable and many wvw players (including myself) went out of their way to buy it and while it does what it's supposed to in PvE, the WvW experience with this content feels extremely lacking. Yes it was meant only for PvE, but since it's available in WvW I feel we should get a good amount of content from it. There is simply no foreseeable reason you'd want to make PvE content over the others. This content needs some serious buffs in WvW; I can already think of an example being having something new to make the experience fresh, exciting and meaningful. Please ArenaNet.
---
&gt; theorized 
---
nice try though
---
And what would YOU lose if you weren‚Äôt using it in PvE and use the other 6 mounts that you have anyway? I call it being greedy, its for WvW, its exclusive to WvW, its a cherry that makes people want to try the gamemode which is definitely a good thing - if it was buffed up in PvE it wouldn‚Äôt have the same appeal. Its fine as it is. 
---
Now After the nerf the Poor cat Lands in the Water...
---
well at least anet is giving us Achievements for animals cruelty 
---
Cool, but guild wars stuff doesn't go on the gw2 sub Reddit. Games are so different, would be like making Hearthstone posts on the wow sub Reddit. Doom box is a cool guy though.
---
Well no it shouldn‚Äôt be better in PvE. You still have  six more mounts, and raptor and jackal do a much better job than that one does in PvE. The whole concept of it , armored look, mist spirit, etc is inspired by WvW and tied to WvW, so no, its still greedy. Plus yeah PvErs would pop in- get it- get out and never step in there again. 
---
You can jump into pretty much every objective with out using siege, to put it in perspective after the op got to inner garrison he could now also jump into lords room using a even easier spot
---
The "nice try though" was pointed towards the scholars and researchers,
---
It is indeed *possible* that humans were brought from another *plant*, though I have not seen any facts regarding it. 
---
Probably asked a bajillion times but what the heck... The builds in metabattle (particularly open world ones) seem a couple of updates old? Still being updated or team too busy? Alternatives? I know open world is easy, but I like a bit of structure in my play so yeah
---
Yeah, I purchased base game plus both expansions and only had one bank tab.  Bought a few more though.
---
I kinda like it, but I'm neither a writer nor is english my first language so maybe if you want feedback on your writing you should post in a subreddit for storytelling/fanfiction or something like that? My guess is, you won't get much helpful feedback in here and the question if  your story is good or not does not depend on knowledge of the game it is based on. Just maybe explain what a soulbeast is in one sentence and you are good to go in writer focused subreddits.
---
Charr Serenadin'
---
All those things you can do with 4 DH:
---
* Quickness (+fury) on shorter cooldown
---
* You have 4 Greatwords to pull
---
* Wall of Reflection
---
And for burst considering you are underlevelled and fights will usually last around 10-25 seconds even after the Rigthous Instincts nerf DH will still have a far superior burst than Chrono considering the duration of fight and that Chrono needs quite a lot crit modifier.
---
Not saying Chrono cannot make it work  but for a faceroll runs stacking DH as been pretty reliable tactic in most paths (especially since the Chaos Chrono nerf). Tbf you could also be running a bunch of Reapers instead if you don't need any blasts.
---
Not Anet's problem.
---
Auric Basin is, in my opinion, the best place to practice. Start at North, work round clockwise. Be friendly. Tell people to wait when you need to wait. Tell people when they'll need stability. Link waypoints (ctrl+click to auto send, shift+click if you want to add text). 
---
For the battles in the centre, coordinate with other commanders to get people with lots of CC and knockback to the South entrance as that's one that can go wrong quickly with the wrong skill composition. 
---
It's a simple meta, usually chilled out and always busy. 
---
Charr that stand up straight are traditionally flame legion and/or magic users so it's not viewed positively
---
I mean, I once unlocked a pvp rune set as a pve player. Why didn't I get a free set of them in my inventory for pve/wvw use?
---
I also went out of my way to obtain arrow carts, and I can't even build those in pve? Wth Anet? 
---
/s
---
&gt; i mean the explicity state that they mean 3rd party software, shutting him down when hes talking about exploiting.
---
They explicitly stated that it doesnt matter, if the exploiting was done with the help of 3rd party software or not, its still exploiting.
---
I used to like it, my first experience of the game was divinity's reach so it reminded me of fable.
---
They always had it in the original GW too, only the Flame Legion shamans stood upright.
---
That‚Äôs a massive amount of PageFaults you have there. First check the basics. Get https://crystalmark.info/en/software/crystaldiskinfo/ to see the status of your Hard Drives. Maybe the drive which hosts C: has defective sectors
---
Furthermore check https://www.memtest86.com/. Test if your RAM has defective sectors. Either of those might cause heavy PageFault numbers. (But more likely your hard drive)
---
Also I see you have a hefty virtual memory number going. If you have the dosh, get a second 8GB RAM stick instead of having a massive page file. Your hard drive will thank you (if it could)
---
[https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Holosmith\_-\_Power\_DPS\_No\_Kit](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Holosmith_-_Power_DPS_No_Kit)
---
There you go. Just exchange the offhand pistol for a shield and healing turret for AED if you want CC.
---
Oh God no.
---
B&amp;S earns a lot in Korea, it's not so popular in West anymore. 
---
World boss portal device is another option if you have gems. Otherwise check wiki for world boss timers and locations so you know which part of the maps to explore.
---
Is it common for arcdps to cause the occasional crash, or is it indicitive of a larger issue?
---
Not really but there are a few tricks. First off, use a timer (website or app) to track the spawn time of all the bosses. Secondly, check LFG for WB  squad/train. When you join one, you can use Teleport to a friend (if you have) on the squad commander, or just open the map, look for the commander tag and get there as fast as possible.
---
Also get a mount if you have PoF and get PoF if you don't
---
There is no source because it's total BS. Firstly, humans never oppressed charr - this is downright fact; the two waged war, but humanity never won against or oppressed the charr, they could only ever force the charr to retreat - and secondly, nothing says they were mimicking mankind. Nothing says *why* their spellcasters and shaman caste were standing upright.
---
What is **shown** is that only spellcasters ever stood upright, and even in GW2, spellcasters are more upright than those who aren't. But it is also stated (by Olias) that the charr spine has a natural curve in it, that their normal posture is to be hunched over. It has been canon lore since GW1 that the hunched over position is the natural stance for a charr.
---
I'm waiting to finish getting my character to 80 and finishing the Heart of thorns expansion before getting PoF or do you think getting PoF asap for the mount is worth it?
---
Is that item worth to get?
---
&gt; endless progression 
---
Uh.
---
What?
---
Are you sure you're thinking about gw2? IMO the game is one of the least grindy MMO games out there. 
---
Almost every single "grind" in the game is optional. Gear? I'd bet big money that you can run around in open world with only masterwork. 
---
Cosmetics? Obviously there's some work to be had for the ones you get via achievements but nothing too outlandish or crazy. And the gemstore's pricings for most of its outfits and accessories are pretty fair.
---
&gt; Which I assume
---
Well, I think I spotted the problem. Don't assume anything if you haven't even tried it. The core game is F2P anyway and you'll have access to some endgame already. What do you have to lose by trying except time?
---
I wouldn't play if I couldn't transmute my gear like we can. It's so boring to see endless waves of players wearing the exact same thing, that's what makes gw2 a little unique. Sure a lot of stuff is super flashy, but everyone has the option to look unique and still use great gear. 
---
That's funny considering you only need mounts for content that requires 0 iq. Anything remotely fun can be done without mounts with the exception of raids where they forced mounts, i know a huge amount of raiders who only unlocked them prior to wing releases
---
I know for sure that the ones at hills still work, a friend and I went to test it Sense we owned it at the time
---
I think its in the very beginning of /crossarms emote

Charr in 1070 B.E - Charr in 1330 B.E
---
WHAT HAPPENNED?
---
So, Arenanet decided to put the dreaded US Armed Forces [S9 "Birth Control" Glasses](https://taskandpurpose.com/brief-history-militarys-unsightly-birth-control-glasses) into the game?
---
The next step then for clarification: Are the other versions of Tyria we fight in the Mist Wars also part of the same universe?  
---
The answer seems simple and probably fairly obvious but there are some potentially big implications to it either way. (Way beyond the scope of the GW stories ofc)
---
Nope, you'll only miss the rewards and achievements but you can tag along to see the story. 
---
That's why I said they can achieve higher damage. Both ele and thief have a lot higher damage potential, it's just harder to manage than on rev and necro.
---
I doubt most players care about that. The upright charr just look better imo and should have been an option in game for charr creation.
---
Try to come up with one on your own. Worth the effort because fun and learning. 
---
Some Tips:
---
+ 3000 deff
---
At least 1 stunbreaker.
---
At least 1 or 2 Twitter sources of stability 
---
1 defensive traitline
---
Try to Chose one of the following and build 2 traitlines according:
---
Cleanse
---
Healing
---
Condition DMG
---
Normal DMG
---
 
---
If You dont need two traitlines Chose one to take a trait that improves one Kind of abilities.

&gt;these sets don't seem to be mentioned in game by any of the NPCs. You're just supposed to know it's there and go do stuff for it. But if you're a casual player, how are you supposed to find out these collections exist?
---
Aren't you notified of the collections by getting a drop and then it flashes a collection notice on your screen (which is then in your Achiev panel)? And if you miss the notice you can examine the item in your inventory that says "part of a collection" or something?
---
Ah, good catch, just might be it. 
---
&gt;"we'd like to look into every aspect of the situation before taking action, but do not have the resources."
---
As someone who works in support saying this would get me fired faster than suggesting a customer to shit in his server rack.
---
Why would you imagine that anyone would care?
---
"Swimming" like across a lake/river or just for fun is definitely out of the question but someone who has trained for battle and lived a very physically demainding lifestyle (and knows how to swim and tread water) probably could "swim" just far enough to save themselves from drowning if they fell in.  
---
That isn't mentioning a ton of reasons to actively avoid the water while strapped into gear made of iron and leather that cost as much in medieval times as a Ferari does today... Or the fact that most European rivers would likely have had a dangerous level of human sewage in them near towns, etc.  
---
They had good reasons to fear the water, even if they believed in the wrong ones.
---
Pay gems to make it look better
---
The only reason why I haven‚Äôt gotten to it is because I struggle to keep playing a single character. Furthest I‚Äôve gotten on one character is part way through HoT. The altaholism is real.
---
You really shouldn't answer questions if you don't know the answer.
---
The shared instance system still triggers even if they don't own the content, The only requirement is that both players are in the map. Because  the LS2's maps Dry Top and Silverwastes are open to all players a player with LS2 unlocked can bring along a player without it unlocked, They just don't get the completion rewards.
---
Because LS3 onwards have unlock gated maps they are a different issue.
---
just /wiki et
---
and what do u mean sprung forward? thats not till end of month isnt it?
---
You have a speed boost on your own territory, that could change the results
---
that character is actually not mine &gt;.&lt; all the charr are from (gw2style)[http://gw2style.com/index.php] - i do have charr that follow "realistic" armor designs, just no good screens of them - and (that one in particular)[http://gw2style.com/look.php?id=15257] belongs to N7 Waynner. i can only assume that because the charr isn't holding any weapons that it's a frame of one of the few emotes that make charr stand up straight or even that it's a skill from revanant? - i wouldn't recognise it because i don't have a charr revanent currently so.
---
are you upset because you can't look pretty? sorry i don't understand your complaints?
---
Daredevil's Pulmonary Impact then?
---
That shitty support daredevil I made that has crazy Regeneration and incredibly high dodge uptime with D/D, SB and poisons. 
---
Also my celestial DH which might not be the highest in dps but gets shit done certainly
---
Man, I can't stand the cultural armor for them.
---
I stick with either the ascended heavy armor minus the hat or Balthazar's outfit minus the hat.
---
They have the same problem that Tauren do due to being hunched which means it's nearly impossible to find a cool hat.
---
Season 2 maps are packaged into the base game, they dont get unlocked with the episodes. 
---
Do you have any examples of modrem wearing krytan? As far i know all mordrem in HoT wear modrem weapons or leyline.
---
It's not a horseshoe, it's a Gank Magnet!
---
Didn't know that. When did they push LS2 with the base game?
---
http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vdAQFASnsTBtbhFpCepCEqilKjSs7Cgwjetj77O86KmtD-jlB1wAaVCu6BA6A2p+zh9HWq8DwFAIAACwP/ZA4n/8n/8n/sr7zf+zf+zf+zf+zfWKA/mZB-w
---
But but lore.
---
They didn't push LS 2 with the base game. The maps that come with LS 2 are Dry Top and the Silverwastes. You can enter those maps whether or not you own LS 2, you just can't do the story.
---
Anet didn't start locking the LS zones behind story till Season 3.
---
Tag up auric basin east and afk after the first burn phase.
---
Agreed. This way roamers would still be able to gank without having to risk to waste traits or sigils on just dismounting the other players. And the pull itself would just dismount you, so it's not like you get instantly nuked.
---
Any time is a good time.  Materials are available on the TP or you can harvest from maps.  The level range of a zone determines what materials will be available in it. (So ~1-10 will have copper ore an lv80 will have mithril ore.)
---
There are two ways to craft.  The expensive, slow, but immersive way is where you discover things on your own and create gear that your characters might need to level crafting.  The cheap, fast, but kinda boring way is to use a crafting guide like http://gw2crafts.net/ .
---
Can we put that one on the right in a bonfire please?
---
Oh okay so they're both anomalies
---
Condis don‚Äôt need to be as good as power in WvW nor PvP.
---
There is already enough visual vomit in this game. Receiving and dealing condi damage takes the focus off the actual action and puts it on the UI.
---
It‚Äôs obnoxious, counter-intuitive, and not fluid. With power, an animation happens, damage is done. It makes sense.
---
Condis in PvP and WvW should be more supplemental. That‚Äôs the hard truth. Gw2‚Äôs advantage is that its combat is fluid, and action-based. Condi damage just doesn‚Äôt have synergy with this game, at least in PvP content.
---
Earliest 2025 if it will get announced today. 8,5 hours remaining.

It's even a bit weirder because both Dry Top and Silverwastes were added in sections...we didn't get the whole zone at once. We discovered the zones little by little in tune with the story. I really enjoyed that part of it.

I‚Äôve been part of a Raid training group for about two years. Our group has remained fairly static, but honestly were not anywhere close to your level (Xera still gives us a little trouble). The leaders are really good, and they‚Äôre super patient with the rest of us. I‚Äôve also done fractals in spurts since they‚Äôve come out, and I am level 74, so ‚Äúhigher than some, not as high as others.‚Äù I know I could be higher, but I just can‚Äôt find people in my various guilds that still want to do Fractals. And I don‚Äôt pug.
---
Having said that for context, clearly you are an exceptional player. From what I can tell, it looks like 80% of this is understanding how to combat the mechanics, and 20% is total mastery of a profession/build.
---
My one question: is it that you just play this a lot over and over and over and over again in order to master of the mechanics and just intuitively know how the fight should go? Or are you just good at video games naturally? I ask because I‚Äôve met a few in the latter category.
---
Crafting and progress in the game are not exactly linked together. You can maximize everything right away at level 1 or never at all. You do however, might want to consider doing it when you have some pocket change and want to progress past end game. You can earn ascended armor and weapons in many ways but it could be a viable alternative to start with some crafted pieces first. 
---
Food you can craft cheaper in a lot of cases as well and there are some food and utilities you need to craft which are best in slot. 
---
All in all it really depends what you are doing or what your plans are. If you intend to take instanced content seriously (raids and fractals mostly) I would consider getting some crafting professions up as soon as you can spare the gold after hitting max level. For WvW you definitely want to look into cooking as well since you can get some very strong pieces of food which are account bound and need to be crafted. 
---
It is established canon that warclaws were created with the same kind of magic that created the exalted and the forged, i.e. a soul bound to armour. So where did the soul come from? At same point the warclaws had to be living beings, so they very well could have been Charr that sacrificed their bodies for victory.

"If Guild Wars 2 is such a good game, how come there is no Guild Wars 2 2?"
---
Thanks yeah. It was really to see peoples' opinions on if it is worth going for the +5/+9s
---
This. 
---
That is an out of memory issue and assuming you are just running GW2 and maybe a couple other things the amount of memory you have should be enough which means there is probably a memory. Since I and most other people aren't running into that(my GW2 memory usage remains pretty stable) that leaves one of the drivers.
---
Only thing I can think of is to go through the DllList and figure out where each one come from and uninstall anything that is not part of windows or your graphics driver. If nothing else you can determine if the source lies in one group or the other.
---
There's no reason to assume they will develop 3 anytime soon. World of Warcraft has been rolling since 2004.

You could use them for salvaging all your blues and whites but at least for me space is more valuable than the salvage kit.

Unless you don't care about the mats you get back, only use those on white gear.
---
Its a real shame you're getting so many downvotes on this post, I think its a really good discussion topic. 
---
I don't think that antitoxin has a huge negative impact on the game right now, mostly because firebrand, scrapper and tempest all have way too much cleanse baseline. The problem is, long term, it either forces condi out of group fight metas permanently or makes anet add way too much condi application to make it viable (and I'd really rather not ever see more application than scourge already has personally).
---
I think it was a pretty unnecessary addition to the game when it was implemented. Such a powerful effect should really have more of a downside, the new altruism runes are a way better designed condi clear rune for example.
---
It's not. The increase is negligible.
---
No?  Rewards don't magically take care of themselves or accumulate because you're having fun.  What?
---
This looks like it was typed up in LaTeX... 
---
Minstrel tempest, fb, chrono, spellbreaker, scrapper, renegade, herald...
---
Keep in mind that the game was originally designed to have conditions just as an addition to normal/power damage. Addition of condi damage stats increased diversity but also fucked up the balance completely.
---
Perhaps it was ‡≤†‚Äø‚Üº
---
for the various bags that drop from HoT metas and events that claim to be afected by magic find, is it worth saving those up and opening up on a level 80 after the Silverwastes and VW metas with MF boosts? I did this but got no rare drops, was not sure if just bad luck (no pun intended?)
---
Could take less if they recycle GW2 assets, which is the ideal approach (just make GW3 be like GW2.5).
---
But doesn't make it everything more realistic?
---
I mean most mordrem were created inmid of a war, isn't it logical to just let them take the enemies weapons instead of creating own?
---
The Djinn looks pretty good with the bandit swords and why should every Djinn forge his own weapon, they are no warriors. Most of them just need to defend themselves and that's it. And since they mostly use their magic anyway, weapons are not that important. 
---
The spectral weapons on the other hand uses orrian swords and gods themed shields. I think this fits well.
---
Scientist/mathematician or do you just like your stuff to look crazy professional?
---
No it's not the problem with the engine if they wanted to fix something like outside map breaking they could have put death wall and not kick zones or on known places they could have put small invis walls or smoothen the terrain the problem is they can't find all the pixel jumps and places to glitch without any testers because I'm sure these testers are eather Workin on pve garbage or testing new living story and maps every glitch jump etc is fixable 
---
Scrapper doesnt really have aoe damage potential. Playing bruiser for the sake of living long and staying on tag is just pointless because you can do the same on heal scrapper while providing heals and cleanses for 10+ people.

You asked what builds are tanky, your question was answered. A simple google search of "GW2 &lt;build name here&gt; wvw build" would net you plenty of results. 
---
[Minstrel tempest](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=gw2+minstrel+tempest+wvw+build)
---
[Firebrand guardian](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=gw2+firebrand+guardian+wvw+build)

---
[Herald](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=gw2+herald+wvw+build)
---
If you can't figure that much out, you're gonna need a lot more than a tanky build to not die in WvW. Also ungrateful tone of "those are just words" really doesn't help your case.

That is the message from arc. The real exception is on the next line but if it is "exception: 0xC0000005" then that is not very informative either.

There are tools to help  with locating the source of those sort of errors but they are not consumer level things.

Last i checked, condition had animations to attacks too. Except you live longer to clean it or heal.

---
Nobody is going to sit here and hand you everything you need to know about a build on a platter. You were told the tankiest elite specs as there's no one build for any class. It's then on you to expand on that and learn more and figure out which you want to play. 
---
Some of the meta WvW builds are minstrel firebrand, marauder spellbreaker and marauder herald, all of them with their own strengths and weaknesses. Pick one, gear it, play it.

Do you have any records?

Also everything?

Or maybe they just fucked it up? I don't know, you tried making up some excuses there, but they're pretty easy to dismantle:
---
* Who the hell in Maguuma is using Krytan weapons? Can you point me to a single NPC where mordrem could have acquired those weapons from?
---
* Djinn are from Elona and should use weapons from their own region, like the [Sunspear sword](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sunspear_Cutlass), for example.
---
* [Spectral shields](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shield_of_the_Dragon%27s_Deep) exist, why not use those?

LN seems to dominate current-patch and Full-Wing Times (all of the non LN Full Wings are just "accidents" from ARP for example)

Maybe other guilds only grind when an all time record is on the line?

I hope that the popularity of speerdun.com/gw2 and its sub-categories rises so other guilds will go for current numbers too and we all get some good rivalries and memes

Now that makes even more sense. There a bug with a certain Win10 version where, if you left the dynamic sizing of your page file on, it created an absurdly big page file thus eating up all the space.

---
On a side note, it's pretty dumb that this game is over 6 years old and still doesn't have a system by which two players can trade items safely between one another.

I'm personally playing my ranger without mount, makes more "sense" RP-wise.

When I got my girlfriend into GW2 she had never played online games at all. Now she has more hours than me!

---
&gt;scepter/warhorn for tempest
---
that's a condi build, so if you allready have a full zerker set not your firts choice
---
Side Tip: If you need to give more than 500g to any one individual, I'd recommend you instead use liquidable items like Ectos/Mystic coins along with the gold.
---
Leave it too Arenanet to F\*ck up a great farm, I'm sick of their screwball nerfs
---
Scepter/Warhorn is not a condi build
---
Those guys are MAJESTIC. 
---
... In their own ways. 
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Tempest_-_Power_DPS_(Fractal)
---
This build uses beserker gear and scepter/warhorn, so no need for stat changes
---
Being a Scrooge would mean destroying them for space.
---
If you need other specs lemme know.
---
Upvote for the effort and kudos to the community for continuing to carry this content with players-hosted tournaments when Anet gave up on releasing raids.
---
Sadly the hardcore community in this game has been thinning so much and for so long because of absurd gaps to release a yearly mini-raid of 2-3 bosses... So much wasted potential with this unique combat system. :'(
---
Its not dumb, its a design decision, and a vital one at that. Despite the existence of r/gw2exchange it is highly probable that the greatest number of expensive commodities are still traded through the TP, not to mention your everyday stuff like materials. This economy needs those 15% taxes, its the only gold sink that applies to anyone, that isn't optional. If you could easily circumvent the TP, we would have extreme inflation.
---
Also, it keeps the chat clean of WTB / WTS spam, which, even if you offer deciated channels, won't stay in those channels.
---
I think that an upright option would be great, as in you have the option to play an flame legion charr seeking redemption or something.
---
Of course, they'd all be male if upright, unless Anet added some secret sect of wicked witch charr or some such. 
---
Tempest is easy mode with overloads that break stun and apply Protection by default. 
---
No such luxuries on Weaver.
---
Making your own build in gw2 isn't that hard. If you're so completely clueless that you need someone to recommend you one, then yeah, metabattle is what you're going to get. You pick your gamemode and class and it has options for you.
---
&gt;"Hey Lolice, can you recommend me an anime movie?"
---
And yeah, that's what I'd say. Go to CR and pick something. What kind of anime are you trying to watch? Give me some specifics. If you ask a broad question, you're going to get a broad answer.
---
Funny, I was going to make the same post but forgot. 100% agree.
---
&gt; but if it is "exception: 0xC0000005"
---
It is.
---
Alright gotcha. I guess I can just chalk this up to a bug or whatever.
---
i really hope anet can end this dragonslayer story line so we can go for example to Cantha and settle a civil war or something similar which is more focused on a place or nation and does not span the entire planet. 
---
This is not a "deliberately suboptimal" build at all, and doesn't really belong in this post.
---
It's perfectly acceptable as DPS in raids, as you've found (even Snowcrows has it listed as a variant of the Power DPS Holo build), and, as you also said it's very competitive DPS. In fact, in many situations it's going to be *better* than Rifle/Kits because the rotation is much easier and thus less prone to losing DPS to mistakes along the way.
---
I'd call it just about as close as you can get to optimal in a *realistic* sense rather than a *theoretical* sense. There are people who can execute the Rifle/Kits rotation perfectly, I'm sure, but 99.9% of engie players aren't going to be one of those people.
---
My GF got me into the game too, I always feel bad because of how bad I am when we play together but it's really fun 
---
Thanks. How is the profit compared to SW?
---
This entire project was a failure from the start, because Legendary Imbued Shaman is classified as an elemental, not a demon.
---
I just remember getting kicked out of raiding training groups and some pugs because I was not running rifle. Which is why I added it on this page.
---
It was pretty much the only gold source from GH after doing the daily chests.
---
You‚Äôre blatantly wrong when when neither ele sigil nor ele pots work, and demon pot does
---
Don't get me wrong, I am very happy with the state of things and I wouldn't trade any of it for more game time. I am definitely lucky! 
---
Ele potions work.
---
If you bothered to read what I wrote, you‚Äôd see that ele pots do *not* work
---
Can't you try the f2p version and see yourself :?
---
i wish anet devs could just give us a list of each fractal and what sigils/pots work there and on what mob. like i still dont know if the new siren's reef fractal uses ghost slaying (pirate ghosts), bandit slaying (since the skeleton boss drops bandit champ bag) or none.
---
Oh, y-yeah I forgot about that... thanks.
---
Yes exactly. Thanks for the info. 
---
I thought he qualified as a grawl?
---
or was it a boon-heal thief?
---
I just installed the free version, and your estimations are almost spot on. It looks really good I might just put on the frame cap and deal with the lower fps. One other question if I wanted better performance what should I upgrade first, GPU or CPU? I have some spare cash laying around so I might be able to upgrade.
---
Are you running it in Boot Camp? That setup shouldn‚Äôt have too much trouble getting 30-60+ FPS outside of zergs. The Mac clients pretty bad, and only gives me about 1/2 the FOS of the Windows client. 
---
Play WvW.
---
Oh no the ANET SJW are here to down vote and up vote. No surprise's here.
---
I guess, just zerging for what though? Again, I know this isn't your issue to solve, but what's the goal to it?
---
wat?
---
Best comment in the thread. Now I want someone to do an edit with a video
---
Just get a weaver, renegade, dragonhunter, mirage, daredevil, deadeye, soulbeast, scourge, chrono and condi holo and you are good to go.
---
Show us on this doll where the mod touched you... 
---
is this drama?
---
OP is extremely upset, check their post history.
---
that's what i'm saying 
---
Fun
---
I have i5-6600, GTX 960 2GB and 8GB RAM and I'm getting 50-60 FPS on max settings in normal open world PvE, 30-40 FPS in cities and 20-25 FPS in world bosses.
---
Well, max settings minus character model limit and quality on medium which helps a lot without sacrificing anything important plus 1680x1050 instead of 1920x1080
---
Also I noticed disabling reflections made my FPS go from 25 to 40 at the very demanding view to Tarir from above in Auric Basin plus lowering shadows from ultra to high gave almost 10 FPS average FPS boost in the dense HoT maps.
---

It was meant to be a less static marker if your party doesn't want to swap targets. You can also use it on friendly targets to symbolize you want to assist them. 
---
Lol
---
If their motive was to enforce 15% trade costs they could just add the 15% trading cost to the mail you send trading items in and call it 'Black Lion Secured Mail' or something like that. That would also remove any addition WTB / WTS spam because the only difference would be for specific trades anyway. You're making excuses for lazy design.
---
I turned mine into+9s and +11s for my alt characters. Then you need it for the fractal account upgrades. Other than that you can just save or sell them. 
---
Hi ! The solution would be to put your items in a guild bank and invite your friend in this guild. If you have anything left... I'm here! :p (JMoums.4931) Happy ending !
---
Yeah I thought he still qualified anyway. 
---
Because it is the right and legal thing to do. Why would you even ask such a thing wtf? Totalitarian states make up charges and remove opposition like this. I am bamboozled that you would even ask. Holy shit. 
---
If OP decided to waste money he could probably take them to court for terminating acc on a false basis, which is exploiting using a 3rd party program. But I'm pretty sure Anet explained they have rights to terminate any acc for any reason they come up with in their terms majority of us never read.
---
Not gonna spend money on a company that can fuck me over any second on some made up charges. 
---
Yes. I thought that he still qualified anyway since he just transforms into the winged demonic thing. 
---
In my experience I can't just force myself to play a game and still enjoy it. Try some new things, maybe command a meta event, run a hp train, do dungeon speedruns, make jumping puzzles in your guild hall, become a theorycrafter and make new builds, all manner of different things. And if you still don't find something you want to do then play some new games and come back when you feel like you want to do something again.
---
The once limit was really annoying. Bought gems for 7.  T\_T
---
We actually do know they came from another world. We also know they came to Tyria seeking peaceful lives (which Balthazar preceded to screw up by promoting human domination of other species), and that the world humanity came from was with so little (or no) magic and that when they arrived on Tyria it had so little magic (only way for most humans to use magic at the time was signet rings, like the one found during Be My Guest) that they had believed the gods made magic.
---
We also know that other universes function as alternate realities, with multiple Tyrias existing across multiple universes, and the Mists being a multiverse.
---
We don't know anything about the world humanity came from (aside from the low/no magic thing), but based on how other universes are alternate realities and these alternate Tyrias all have humans, we can conclude that humans are of the same reality.

CPU
---
I played with a gtx970 forever with max settings and it was fine. GW2 is a very processor heavy game. 
---
Best thing is to take a _**full, uninterrupted break**_
---
* Don't log in at all
---
* Don't read about it
---
* Don't go on forums, reddit, etc

Take at least a month and it'll come back

Happens to me and some friends every now and then, recently came back after 3-4 months and whew!!

Tts does it, I joined their run last night and completed it successfully for the first time

&gt; As far as I know
---
As far as canon lore goes, no explanation is given. It's as simple as that.
---
&gt; Though that also means it would've been so bad-ass if Flame Legion casters and Gaheron Baelfire stood tall.

They do. Especially Gaheron. There is still an arch in their neck, but their backs are straight.

Might pick up a name change just in case inspiration hits me.
---
You can take a break if you are feeling burned out. Since there is no sub fee or gear treadmill nothing is being wasted by putting the game aside for awhile.
---
Do remember that if upgrading CPU, that means jumping several generations ahead, which means you will surely need a new MoBo, which means (recomended) a clean install of your OS which is a chore and more money. But yeah, I still have that old GTX960 I talked about and it's just fine. Upgrading CPU would be better for the game. GW2 benefits the most of sincle-core speed since it's not so well hyper-threading optimized.
---
That idea stops working the moment you decide to trade items for items (how would that system deduct 15% value from non-currency items?), and if you restrict it to item vs currency only, the trading post already does this, so it would be redundant.
---
I fail to see how this system would prevent WTS/WTB spam if it exists so you can trade outside of the TP, which would then be ignoring the market prices by going low or high and ignoring the competition inside the TP. Thats something you'd want to advertise in chat, because it's an official ingame system and all that, secure for everyone. Effectively it would create a second TP, a very vocal one.
---
The second I forgot about GW2 and oppened my eyes for other games, I was blown away. Not a single customer deserves to be treated like we were treated (past tense because I excluded myself from it). Constant bullshiting, devs not understanding their own game, false bans, no content, unfinished content, empty promises,...
---
What is this from?
---
That's a good question! I'll try it tonight at reset and I'll let you know about the result.
---
Expansion
---
funnily enough i was in the same position as you, got to a point i hit a wall pretty hard and couldn't find enjoyment or the want to do anything, but picking up raids (after having the stance of not wanting anything to do with them) and doing them a few times a week is actually quite enjoyable. but yeah if you dont like raids at all like others said pvp or wvw is good if you want both can be fun. or just taking a break for a bit. if you dont want to stop playing, helping new players out is always good.
---
This auto-updater has the ability to find your Guild Wars 2 installation in strange directories (has been a problem for some of my guildies), decide what addons to enable (the extras or buildtemplates), saves state between runs so it doesn't do those things every single time, only downloads the .dlls again if there's been an update since the last time it ran, and can optionally start Guild Wars 2 after updating.
---
When you use the -CreateShortcut flag, it uses the Guild Wars 2 icon and creates a shortcut to the script with the -StartGW flag enabled, so you can just use that to start the game from now on and keep ArcDPS up to date all the time.
---
Also comes with an uninstallation method using the -Remove flag for those who don't like it or experience heavy crashes.
---
Don't get me wrong, I like these speedclear strats and they are definitely creative and fun but my biggest fear is when these same guilds try to apply it to PUG runs when they command and declare it the norm instead of doing mechanics. A couple weeks ago, I ran into a couple guys listed from one of the three speedclear guilds above pugging, and they wanted to skip the pyres on Qadim. Needless to say, they insisted that this was the normal strat and the normal way of splitting up was "retarded". They ordered people around, belittled them and cycled through at least 8-10 kicks. Their attitude was really shitty for a speedclearing guild. They took what could have been a 30 minute fight tops on Qadim and stretched it into an hr and a half shitfest and then raged. My point I guess is while all of these kills are impressive, they skip a lot of mechanics and mechanics are key to doing clean kills, especially in the later wings where they are more punishing. 
---
Grawl = human + charr

I prefer to just pick a map and clear it completely one at a time. Most maps can be done in under 2 hours probably much faster if you have mounts. Doing it this way you avoid the issue of getting almost done only to realize you are missing a few random things and having to check each map to figure out what it is.

I play on mac from an external harddrive, You just Put the installer in the external harddrive and start the download!
---
in pvp which classes are considered direct counter to warriors?
---
the only change they need to do is remove the 10k gold cap from tp..everything else you suggested is just using the tp but with 10 extra steps added for no real reason
---
sounds like a bug
---
whats easiest class to play in wvw zerging
---
I agree with your point.  It's a BS reason.  For instance, I've gotten bugged on the warclaw and technically that's an "exploit" because you can use weapon skills while mounted with 3 dodges.  I'm sure it looks janky to enemies so it's possible people can report me.  It's worrying that some Anet "investigation" (lmao yeah right) can result in false accusations of hacking.  Also many people have known about a lot of these bugs for years and Anet has never even shown the slightest interest in fixing them.

Ghai Commander! Welcome to Amnoon.
---
Are they really checking everyone for meta builds?
---
Bloodstone shards --&gt; Bloodstone bricks
---
Empyreal fragments --&gt; Empyreal stars
---
Dragonite ores --&gt; Dragonite ingots
---
3 of each will make lesser vision crystals and 5 of each will make a vision crystal, these are used to creating ascended tier gear
---
hmm so are you saying that tempest rebound can avoid people getting dropped during buttons (xera)?
---
Some hearts don't have enough content to do at once or are much easier if the local event is going.  So while completing straight through is generally better if you get struck on a heart finding things to do you should come back after the stuff can respawn
---
One name change contract per character.
---
Charr standing upright is a flame legion thing. 
---
But the option to choose hunch or upright would have been a nice feature during character creation. 
---
Yea pmuch.
---
Armor came to mind first while I was writing, I guess I can edit it.
---
no, but if they obviously deviate from the meta, or are otherwise not fit for the role they are attempting to fill, some commanders will try to replace them.
---
No they request it, and if you fail to live up to whatever it is the bar they have set, you get kicked...
---
examples of "reasons to be kicked" (their validity to me is not included here)
---
- you're not bringing a meta class (w/e the commander is looking for) 
---
- you're running and absolute garbage build on a meta class (e.g. you're running signets and/or weapons aren't part of the meta build, commander can see that)
---
- you die constantly on first engages (suggesting a zerker PvE build)
---
- you squirrel like crazy and aren't on tag.
---
They won't be able to get onto the map. As far as I'm aware you can't even teleport to friend to people in the map if you don't own the associated episode.
---
I like watching wvwers being confused when once in 3 years their game mode gets popular for a week
---
I think it was mentioned at some point as thing the devs would like to look into about half a year ago but since then, no word on it.
---
3 way fights are fun.  If you die standing in cow or AC circles, take it as a hard lesson to kite red circles.  But yes, there are some bad Commanders who don't engage smartly.  Those are usually few and far between, since people tend to stop following bad tags.
---
Istan is dead FYI.
---
Two way, they were both blue.
---
Damn, that game looks super interesting. Too bad I don't own PS4.
---
devonah's rest
---
- Not every skill can be a combo field or finisher.
---
- Because all combo fields follow the same rules. 
---
- Changing a skills type doesn't change the mechanic. Also keep in mind that underwater combat hasn't the highest priority (because almost zero content etc.) and making a skill usable underwater means to create a whole new skill. It's not "just make it an aoe".
---
- Every class/spec has it's problems, however from what I heared scrapper is really good in PvP and WvW now. 
---
- Open world maybe? You can play everything in open world *and* you can make every spec viable in open world. If it's not Raids (actually even in raids) you can play it everywhere.
---
sorry about the legnth. i tried to simplify it but i just found that there was just too much that you need to know so it went on pritty long  with the examples xD
---
The magic is that you can roleplay whatever you want, though.
---
It *would* be cool to have a canon story for the "other side" but, yeah, lots of extra work.
---
Last time a friend bothered trying, the teleport worked (and used the item), but then they got kicked back out of the map without being able to do anything.
---
oh no :( any alternative?
---
But do note that the expansions are entirely separate and you do not *need* one before you're able to enjoy the other. If all you're looking for is the ability to mount up, for example, you won't need to touch HoT at all =] 
---
SW is still the same
---
Lol that is the official symbol of Kaineng before the bandwagon. 3 bandwagons and counting. It always come back to us. 
---
Really? I haven't seen anything like this happening. Every zerg I've been in has been looking for *fights*, not a handful of scattered easy kills that die so fast that most of the zerg doesn't even get a bag for it.
---
Occasionally we'll cross paths with the lagging tail of another zerg, or some stragglers trying to rejoin their zerg, but that's not on purpose, it's just something that happens (and has always happened, even before mounts were a thing).
---
This is great, thanks! I've been thinking recently about getting a makeover kit so this is great timing
---
Correct on scourge/fb. FT engi wont tag anything and is just a dead weight.
---
Just as an aside, going back to the same hill repeatedly can be part of a strategy to deplete the enemy's supplies. 
---
&gt; But surely you can think of something better than to go back to the same hill over and over, where we know there's a zerg and artillary just shelling away at us while we're trying to get into a reinforced keep. Then when everyone dies, keeping reminding everyone that they are apparently bad for basically facing the same odds as WW1's Liberty Division in the argon.
---
Actually, you are wrong because in the end, its a War of Attrition, at some point they may run out of supply or manpower, if your spawn is closer to the front than yours and you have some roamers flipping their camps.
---
I am not saying this is the best way to command though because Wars of Attrition usually arent a big bumper to troop morale, especially poorly trained ones.
---
Bounty is a set 33% chance of another swing.  Not sure on the special drop ones, but I know some are really low.  At least the Glyph of Bounty can be shared with other tools to get more resources that you want and Forester will only ever give you wood.  Always plan for that future where you ~~want~~ need more iron.
---
No ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I have data but it‚Äòs a bit older. It doesn‚Äòt stack anymore unless a recent patch changed it again. Dm me if you want it because I‚Äòm not gonna look for the sheet unless someone actually cares. 
---
I have no idea what to tell you (and I'm not sure why you would expect anyone else to be able to solve this for you, especially when you shoot down everything they suggest). I've also done all of those things and have many more alts fully geared than you do (except I also do raids, WvW, and sPvP when I'm in the mood), and I'm not anywhere close to burnt out or bored or tired of the game. I still enjoy doing all of those things.
---
If you don't, that's totally fine and fair! Not everyone enjoys the same things for the same amount of time. But it sounds like it might be time to take a break from the game. If you have to actively search for reasons to keep playing, then you've probably reached your limit. At least for the time being.
---
I tried to keep it readable and commented where I thought appropriate. If nobody pipes up, let me know which ones worry you in particular and I'll explain it or show you some demos.

---
If you only play to reach a reward goal, you won't have fun but once you've exhausted PVE content there's no reason not to try to get good in pvp/wvw. In pvp you can set yourself a goal to reach platinum rank (minimum), legend if you really enjoy pvp and getting your name on the leaderboard. There are hours of content right there to learn the intricacies of conquest / class matchups / etc.
---
Then you have WvW; you could try to just be a roamer and fight low scale fights, give yourself a challenge by trying to win outnumbered fights. Find a group of players like-minded and the fun is instantly multiplied. Other way of playing WvW to it's fullest potential is to join a zerg guild who will be looking to fight other guilds/blobs and play the best they can at that. Working together and focusing on improvement is some of the most fun I've ever had in this game :) Maybe give a go to GvG ;)
---
If you're really just a solo player who doesn't enjoy pvp gameplay at all then I see no reason for you to play. There's no harm in putting the game down and picking it up again when you feel like it but I think it would be a shame not to try to get into those other 2 modes beyond surface level.
---
These are really cool! Is it possible to make a Blish one?
---
Sad there isn't a bunch of me pin sniping you. 
---
here, please change your name and face, on me &lt;3
---
Usually - It depends on your definition of 'worth it'.
---
Yeah.  
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous that they have some error with buying gems that‚Äôs been going on for at least six months given how much the gem store is expected to pick up the slack of box sales.  No wonder the last quarter was so poor revenue wise...
---
If most people are like me they‚Äôll just give up and won‚Äôt bother with support tickets, especially given it flashes ‚Äòerror‚Äô up for about 1/2 ms in a tiny font and just sends you back to the start.
---
I disagree completely. If the devs want to add something for this mount, then so be it. If they don‚Äôt, I really don‚Äôt think we have the right to request this when we have so much already.
---
Like a good amount of exp I guess? 
---
Sure, it‚Äôs behind, but not by nearly as much as you‚Äôre claiming it is which has been evidenced in the past by people‚Äôs runs with the comp 
---
I don't have a tumblr anymore because of.... reasons.
---
But I wanted to say that I keep up with your art often, it's really good! Seems like you haven't been feeling that great, judging by the subject on it, so I hope you feel better soon!
---
Took a quick look at it, seems to do what it claims. Nicely organised :)
---
Because nobody in the dev team really cares about Scrapper; as seen during all of the time between HoT and PoF
---
I asume because you haven't played WvW in a long time?
---
At least mark it as a spoiler...
---
bruh on my pentium x hp4000 i run at 30\~ish fps
---
think youll be just fine.
---
&gt; Why do Gyro fields not take priority?
---
My understanding is no field skills have priority, fields are fields, the system's weak and has been since launch.
---
Spoliler would be saying Aurine died in the last episode...
---
Ok, that is why I like druid a lot, Healing and buffing potential.
---
I do know other classes can heal more but is unneeded about 80% of the time until a sigil comes out that gives percent of healing done as barrier or something like that.
---
Right, but what's your graphics settings because I'm trying to run at it highest. I can get 60 plus on the lowest.
---
Who is the girl in this video? This is the 3rd time I've seen one of her clips posted on Reddit.

It‚Äôs been more than a month since the release so spoilers are not needed anymore

Check the Drive link in my comment. I've added one of Blish :) (and many more) 
---
Feels bad to hear that sadly there are some arrogant players in the hc raid guilds. But its only a small amount of players so pls dont think that everyone of us is thinking that way. I know a lot of members in my guild which just pug for fun and dont start to blame pug players if they dont know speedkill strats. But its a bad thing when some hc raiders have a behaviour like this.
---
Whats better for pvp Revenant or Weaver?
---
Check the Drive link in my comment. I've added one of Blish :) (and many more)  Might add the transparant ones later. 
---
And meteors are impressively easy to vaccinate against
---
I get what you're saying and again, I personally believe the authenticity of you and your situation. Not my call to make though, and I get where dornsinger is coming from tbh. When you're working a job you have to follow a protocol
---
Low-effort post. Playing everyday since the warclaw patch ,never seen this.  WvW is totally full, people stay in zerg and wait for running guys. 
---
This is a big problem I have with the game and a big reason keeping me from coming back. I am really negative towards this game and still on this sub because I love the idea of the game, the combat is great, the UI for trading is great, but there are huuuuuuge problems with the overall game structure. In this case, I can talk about raids being one of the game killers. Raids in this game are either memorize a rotation for optimum dps or face the scrublands and probably never get a clear; There is no creative gameplay REGARDLESS of there being creative choices; everything is shoehorned into optimum optimum optimum. Raids for this game needed to be tiered; easy mode for the casual base so they can clear it and see the story; hard mode for those who WANT to work hard at min/maxing with only SLIGHTLY better cosmetic-only rewards for those who do. They split the community to all hell with raids and extremely hard fractal challenges that casuals can't compete for by having FUN and playing how they want to. I love DH longbow; it is wayyy more fun to me than scepter. Good luck clearing a raid with a fun low-dps build. This is why I play FFXIV even though the combat isn't as fun or engaging, the rest of the game makes up for that whereas the rest of GW2 makes itself worse. 
---
Istan is alive and well, it's just not an economy-distorting goldmine like it used to be.
---
It's still one of the more profitable meta events. 
---
Mostly SoS.  Don't go there though.  They have all the OCX players on one server and just blob down pugs thinking they are good.
---

Herald.
---
Raiding is not about puging. To avoid your said problems meta builds are not the problem, just run with your guild
---
I didn't make a note at the time, but it should be 2413 power &amp; 1181 ferocity (assassin's armour, back, one accessory; berserker weapons, one accessory, two rings, amulet)
---
guild runs we run mounts, pugmandering we dont since it causes long tails and makes the group less stacked.
---
I think its because swiftness is consistent in regions where as the speed changes can screw pugmanders  
---
Join one of the few WvW ocx guilds if you want a community during OCX. They are out there, in various levels of seriousness. 
---
I used to be on SoS during OCX and... if you're serious about WvW, don't go there. If you just want a community to play with, they are great people, but you won't find any challenge blobbing down the enemy and then being unable to fight enemy groups when the terms are more even.

For engi you could use Photon Wall (only 3 sec though) or Bulwark Gyro toolbelt (yeah I know it's scrapper but still :p) but solutions are indeed pretty rare :p
---
Dragon Maw is useful for the initial CC and sometimes trash management (around bosses or not). For me it really depends which path I do with my friend (who often runs DD) and what the pugs that join are playing (ie. is the basi venom plus what others take enough to CC instant). But that has not been a question on my mind ever since I got Metal Rods :p
---
On a personal note I tend to feel that engi burst is a bit lacking in the 3 low level dungeons but for the rest it is on the same level as other specs if you are not try harding too much the run. I also just like the absurd burst that 4 DH (or 3 DH and a Stance share pSoulbeast) can have on any mob with a breakbar :p
---
It's because pugging would have a different objective/mindset that a guild group would (although you have some creative pug groups every once in a while).
---
Raid LFG groups want to kill a boss in the safest way possible while not spending too much time on it and failing the least number of tries (basically you just want the kill). If you join as a DPS on such groups people expect that you perform at a decent level comparable to other DPS (some of which will probably "meta" builds). However if those people do 25k dps on the boss but your creative build does only 10k then you are not pulling your weight as much as you could (see for example the DPS you can do just by AFKing on scepter and using traps off CD), therefore it means that people have to pull some of the extra weight you have put onto them (because they need to do more mechanics and they can fail because nobody's perfect for example).
---
This logic is actually what you would call an efficient use of in-game time if you don't have a guild to raid.
---
I will mention a mostly guild raid group I stumbled upon a bit after W4 release where we did W4b123 with a (self proclaimed) Cleric Rifle Warrior that was very happy to say "See we can kill raid bosses with a Cleric Rifle Warrior, I like this build and people that used meta builds are sheeps, I proved them wrong". However all they proved was that their group was able to kill bosses with 9-ish people.
---
I like experimenting builds as much as the next player and I sometimes run stuff that are variation of optimal builds for support builds because they fit better the context in which I am using them. However that does not mean I do not fullfill the role I'm expected to play. So when I play DPS in a pug I go grab the build I think is best suited for a specific fight and group. For some groups it may not matter much if I pick DH or pSoulbeast (for example) in that case I'll just go with what I fancy the most at the time. I have the luxury of liking to play most builds so it makes me not mind at all if I need to swap to something more appropriate (even if it can be a bit dull sometimes I'm the 1st happy to swap Scourge on bosses where it's needed/useful for the epi).
---
*An akin
---
I haven't been able either. Gave up and bought gem cards on eBay with "instant delivery" 
---
How do i go about attaching this to my arcdps files?
---
oooooo like this, is the rotation complicated for this? I prefer Toughness, Healing power, concentration. But is harrier expected from this? Or can I stick with the lather?
---
Fashion wars never ends if you only have 9 characters. 
---
Run around in low level characters and try to see what it's like to speedrun dungeons, ascalonian explorable etc at even lower than recommended levels. It can push the knowledge of your class and bundles to the limit.   
---
Or just WvW with a full zerk PvE Weaver and laugh 
---
No. Fuck no.
---
Vanilla is not as colorfull. This is with reshade :)
---
It looks really good. I recently got reshade so this makes me want to go back just to see the colorful landscapes differently, thank you!
---
idk, but as a relatively new person I now that I've been under a few commanders I now look out for specific commanders that I liked playing with. I had one PUG commander that just went around capping things for hours like it was an EOTM. It went surprisingly smoothly, very little fighting. Then it got taken over by another commander who called them out for being a pussy and only wanted to fight. While purposely looking for large scale fights the entire group wiped like three times before I decided to bail out. Blamed everyone for being PvErs and not stacking, etc.
---
You can go anywhere really.  There's a few of us on Isle of Janthir as well.

Technology isn't there yet, it's only available to the Necro-team and as we know the teams don't like sharing information.

Has SoS OCX picked up "better" guilds? I recall guilds like ZEAL, OCXR, and SoX being the majority of the presence on the server. Although they were lovely people they weren't very "serious" about WvW, at least the fighting side of it. Perhaps a good place to start but not the best way to experience the more competitive side of the mode. 
---
Although at this point it's fair to wonder what the point is when trying to compete when there's not many out there to compete with.
---
I really like how you got in just before the patch because I have to say this week's been really odd to see. 
---
Commanders are just players like you and me. And leading people and being a good players can be 2 different things. Also, the quality of the zerg itself can matter because again, commanders are just one person.
---
Leading people in general is a difficult task for nearly anything. Certainly far more than talking trash from behind a keyboard. 
---
Istan just went the way of some other meta events in that it's daily now. So you can do Istan once/day just not repeatable like silverwastes. Other good options are things like AB meta, TD Meta, Teq, daily fractals (though not really a "farm"), opening chests (like JPs) on alts daily, map rewards (usually just using the [mapping materials](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pact_Scout%27s_Mapping_Materials)), etc. So really the main repeatable farm is just SW but there are many daily farm areas.
---
Bounty is better for extra rewards(t5 gemstone in this case or t6 if you log an ancient one) and you get what you are logging for: elder wood-&gt; elder wood, not sure if the extra "hits" will count as -1... durability; forester will give you the corresponding wood log(elder/ancient wood in this case) based on the level of that map, and will not take a durability point. IMO, if we are talking about glyph, then bounty is the best(value wise) in open world(except guild hall); If we are talking about AXE with limited usage then forester is probably one of the best together with leatherworker. Hopefully my answer helped a little.
---
All mmos. It's a game you play for thousands of hours, listening to the same soundtrack (esp cuz your usually only regularly in a few spots) would actually drive me insane.
---
As if other things he is talking about are true. Tempest struggles even to even basic might up and while it is doing boon rotation it's heal is low and burst/emergency heal is noexistent. Unless there are new "secpter warhon" weapons I don't know about. 
---
With the patch, you can absolutely keep perma might, protection, and regen up with warhorn tempest. Perhaps you're using the wrong build/gear/rotation, but it is definitely possible (and realistic).
---
Since we do not have your exact set and no logs or other data on the actual tries we can only guess as to what you did and cannot confirm if any of your findings are correct. Raging Storm being the main culprit of throwing ALL of your data off.
