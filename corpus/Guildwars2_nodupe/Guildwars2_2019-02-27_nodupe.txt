Holy shit that’s all he posted?

Dungeons are not end game content, they're laughable at best. Stop making excuses for a hollowed out MMO lol. Their closest to endgame is Fractals, which are alright. besides, they literally dropped support for dungeons. On top of all that, massive arenanet layoffs.. rip GW2
---
&gt; Oh goodness. I'm not sure how you found Vindictus's hack and slash play to be more engaging than Guild Wars 2 raids. Unless the game has changed massively since 2009-2010 when I played, which is always possible I suppose.
---

---
I played from end of 2011 to middle of 2012. There were definitely some changes prior to when I started but those were changes to the classes. Such as how Evie's skills worked. The healer aspect was basically gutted. I believe some of the other skills such as the gun/cannon you can summon and the golem also got changed. There were other changes but it's been quite a few years and I didn't pay as much attention to the other classes to begin with.
---
&gt; To me, VG the model being bland doesn't bother me (though I disagree, I think it fits the theme of what they were going for well. Mysterious, magical guardian type thing that's all silent and has mystical powers.
---
It is bland because of its actions or lack of them not because of its model. Although it does seem like ANet somehow overpaid for its creation and ended up using it all over the place.
---
&gt; And I guess a giant polar bear paw, for me, is easily telegraphed and generally boring and trivial to dodge.
---
Well I definitely prefer telegraphed attacks. Especially the hard hitting ones over randomly losing 90% of my health. Although that is more of a fractal and open world problem.
---
Honestly you don't compare them to another non sub game, they all compete for a persons time and are all MMOs. One doesn't go around worrying about the business practices of a company or how they'll sustain said company, they simply care about the product and what it offers.
---
"In GW2 you can stop playing for years and your gear is still just as valid" It also means gear is no longer a reward for playing in a meaningful capacity once you have some. Art is subjective power is absolute. One also isnt a customer if they're not in the game they cant be buying gemstore items right? Counter productive from a business standpoint.
---
*it lacks the holy trinity for group based composition.
---
 Not really its just not as traditional and not always mandatory but does exist.
---
*endless loot treadmill 
---
This too is a false viewpoint the treadmill instantly ends when you have legendary items in a slot. They are always BiS
---
Anets greatest failure is lack of strong leadership and vision. They don't seem to ever be in a rush to complete anything, meet deadlines, or take what works from their competitors. It seems kind of obvious back in the first releases of living world that throwing your work away is the dumbest thing you could ever purpose, yet it was done anyway. They instead are willfully ignorant of what goes on in many other games or think they can do it better but don't. There's this different for the sake of different regardless of outcome idea that doesnt actually work.  
---
They focus things like new player experiences, dodge tutorials, pointless current events, and many other fruitless endeavors but don't double down on well loved things like Holidays SAB ect. 
---
They haven't learned really anything of meaning in the past 6+ years and likely never will. They have gotten away with most of their competitors of recent sinking their own products with even more moronic practices. I will be shocked if the company is still around in 5 years let alone 10 sadly but i hope to be wrong.
---
Words of absolute truth
---
I did **NOT** recommend engi for a new player. I said it's a viable core char so he gets an impression on what's usable and works reasonable with a free account **but is difficult to learn**. I don't understand how you've read that from my post. I recommend a **guard**.
---
Thank you for replying, I've always been a follower of The Orrator but never new you have been fighting cancer this whole time. I've always liked the format and content of your work and I think the quality of the articles and ad designs are great. I would love to see more of The Orrator, but your health is always first and with that being said, I hope you get better soon. 
---
That's because people will un-sub when they stop playing the game, but they won't go delet their gw2efficiency account. 
---
What an absolute melt of a person you are hahaha.
---
If you say so, but you are just proving my point.
---
No, it's not good for zerg fights. You hit too few targets and your zerg support is limited. It's however great at roaming, that means running solo or in a small group.
---
Hey man, I'm sorry you feel Reddit is a reflection of reality. Thats gotta suck. 
---
Am I crazy or was the Distant Lands Mount Adoption License 15 pack discounted from 6000 gems to ~4000 gems recently?  'Cause now it is not discounted, but it's priced 5100 gems...  Was there an announcement about the default price change, or did Anet do something weird?
---
So, in your mind, football teams can never get new players and let old ones go? Same with any sport?
---
League teams cant move on without X player.
---
At some point, the old have to be pushed out, quit being whiney.
---
Thanks for clarifying. I should know better than to get my hopes up on cool concept art, lol.
---
YES 300 going to work on another project, NO One said the 300 is going to work on GW2
---
Diversfication is still obviously important to avoid risks. Your point about riot games shows you didnt even read my first point in the last comment.
---
39 bosses. Maybe 44 depending on how you count them.
---
Turn 4 and a2s are glorified trash pulls. o4s, o8s and o12s are two different bosses in one raid floor. First ultimate was a gauntlet with three bosses without breaks, the second ultimate was 4 bosses also without breaks.
---
Leading a team, giving advice, tell strategies etc. is indeed difficult. Setting up a team is easy. It's just difficult to organise 10 highly skilled and perfect equipped players. But 10 random skilled people: easy.
---
GW1 builds are easier to switch. No one complains about warriors having to run banners in raids, too. That's no problem. New equipment is a much bigger issue - and a non existant issue in GW1.
---
Learning how to play is difficult in GW2, there is no content where you would learn how to play without repeating the same content hundreds of times. In GW1 you knew how to play after finishing story, you were then usually ~ "raid ready". Not prepared for difficult tasks, but able to run easy builds as dps. Mostly bc all GW1 content is instanced teamcontent and you learned how to perform in a team from day 1. Players gave you advice on your build, you learned how to use your skills - in GW2 you don't learn this in storycontent or open world.
---
Seconding. I'm a roleplayer, and my character's apartment uses a structure near the spawn point for Asura. While it's likely not as much as the stream of newbies, there is a bit of a trickle. And Asura storyline is not as conductive for key farming compared to human.
---
Edit: Also every once in a while I see giant swaths of people at Soren Draa's waypoint gearing up for Guild Trek.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Then why wasn't the before price listed as 5100, or the current version showing the persistent discount for the bulk purchase?  It feels really disingenuous to list the before discount price of a bundle that isn't ever going to be listed as that before discount price.
---
Hello. I run a weaver staff dps for fractals.  I am pretty comfortable with my rotation, but what do people do for CC?  Specifically for the boss phases where you need to pump out a lot of CC in a short amount of time in order to break the bosses CC bar.
---
The world is a funny place
---
here is the roadmap:
---
1. Wvw Alliance axed
---
2. Raid axed
---
3. Fractal axed
---
4. Legendary ring axed
---
5. Legendary weapons copy existing skin and call it legendary 
---
6. Living story every 3 months worth 4 hrs of game play
---
7. Cycle existing festival event 
---
8. Dont touch UI since we aint capable of doing it
---
9. Dont touch Game Engine since we aint capable of doing it
---
10. Dont touch server since its cheaper with Amazon
---
&gt; My personal hope is that sooner or later they will extend the copyright exceptions that now apply only to dead standalone games, also to online ones.
---
I fully agree. I wish there was some mechanism or requirement for developers to submit copies of source code for "dead" games to, e.g., the national archives (I guess it would be the Library of Congress in the US? \*is not from the states\*). Beyond that, it'd be nice if more companies were like id and released their engines to the open source community.
---
As it stands now, its in a business' best interest to hold on to any IP related to a defunct game; there's a slim chance that if they release that IP, even if it's for free, that it might become popular and then they have to justify to their shareholders why they lost out on the opportunity to monetize that asset.
---
400 is absolutely bloated. Granted, we don't know what other projects they supposedly were working on, but as far as maintaining and making content for GW2, ANet can easily sustain that with 150-200 people.
---
Though not much of a single moment, Lion's Arch under siege is my favorite. 
---
Thank you for also doing this! This is my post on the event. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/auudcy/a\_celebration\_of\_those\_weve\_lost\_today/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/auudcy/a_celebration_of_those_weve_lost_today/)  
---
Please make sure when you tag up or join, you're looking for the lfg group- "A celebration of support and love", so that everyone looking to join can more easily find you. I never imagined this would blossom in to such an outpouring of support for those no longer with the game, but it makes me so proud to be a part of our awesome community, especially given how many have said they want to participate. Also, make sure if you DO tweet out screenshots, to use the hashtag #Love4ArenaNet, so that this wonderful event can be seen by those that have been reading the tweets with that tag. My acct is BluJasmine.2190, if anyone wants to join me. Thank you again for your help in making this a true statement of what the game means to all of us.
---
I am constantly stuck in an eternal vortex of suck. 
---
I think it's funny how different people's experiences can be. My experience is largely negative. 
---
Not all of them, and the ones which did weren't always seen as valuable. Having done Chuka &amp; Champawat, I loved the tiger quest, but it was so... Clunky. I don't think it added much to the experience overall, for all the hassle it was and the bad implementation it suffered from.
---
Wish they had concentrated on more beefy story that lasted longer than an hour or so rather than a new map every time. It sounds good but good luck getting some of those achievements/collections done if you missed the initial rush on a lot of them.
---
nope. they could restructured and start a few more projects instead of downsizing before this shit needed to happen.  AFAIK NCWest had no unforeseen setback in profit earning projections, thus unexpected mass layoffs is never a beneficial thing to the improvement of quality of existing titles.

better than having a third of an egg each in 3 baskets, 2 of which aren't edible
---
And here I thought it was an agreement forced to sign on your way out so they can blackmail you to get paid and to choose the company over the people that deserve the cold hard truth after 20 years of supporting you.  /S
---
My point remains valid regardless of anet/nc keeping us in the dark so they won't lose money and regardless of Josh picking the choice to look after himself.
---
We deserve the truth
---
You're saying we need a roadmap for the roadmap?
---
I mean, it is, at the end of the day.  Both need to make money, both have employees that are around for a while then have to be let go for various reasons.   
---
Companies need to make money.  Get that through your head.  New blood is good blood, often times.  Look at how often Blizzard/Activision has purged, and they just had their best year in 2018.
---
What are those arm braces? 
---
&gt; Class balance happens at glacial pace.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Class changes beyond balance (reworks / pruning) basically don't happen.
---
These are by far my biggest gripes with the slow release schedule. I personally don't mind that content takes a while to come out, but I do care when something is broken and isn't fixed for 6-9 months, and then the fix is ass backwards and doesn't address the root of the problem (or smiter boons it, or both). Completely unnaceptable, and I really hope that part of this reorganization at Anet involves expanding the balance team and making them work significantly faster
---
because the warclaw was specifically designed for WvW related shenanigans; I highly doubt it would fit with whatever's planned for Episode 6.
---
As someone who has worked under NDA before, airing out the laundry in bitter retaliation is so far off from any sign of professionalism.
---
In case anyone reading needs proof, have some examples: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSQt4ckq-dg), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNPKmXMephs), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRr98d-L3zQ), [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdIXszDgPyE), [5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSQAEgoRnZI), and [6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8r-hMQzRXk).

Electro Swing is pretty good too, definitely worth checking as well. Sadly, it has far less artists. Examples: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfFfxJrKhLw) and [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKOJCTAvK24).
---
We tend a hearth in memory of teh fallen for 3 days. 
---
What sort of skills do you think the Arcane weapon would have and what kind of weapon?
---
Atm we have an Axe, Bow, Hammer, Shield and Greatsword. Part of me thinks a melee Staff would be cool, with 1 or 2 ranged attacks in it too. I’m just imagining it having a mix of daredevil and rev staff animations.
---
Would you want it to replace the greatsword as elite or just add as the Arcane elite skill that is missing?
---
I do like the idea of it, and do want them to flesh out the skills trees that are missing elites or heal skills.
---
What's "on the table"? :p
---
So long as an executive doesn't have to live hand-to-mouth because he made a bad decision while he blithely kicks faithful employees to the curb and votes himself a higher salary and bonus, I'm with you on the union thing.
---
They always use the before discount price. I bought the Branded Bundle skin for 40% off when in reality it's only 25% off (because the bundle was never sold at full price). 
---
So to put it in numbers, though the bundle skin cost 2k, it was always sold at 1600 (20% off). I bought it at 1200 (supposedly 40% off 2k), when in reality it's only 25% off against 1600 gems. 
---
For me, while the discount % serve as a guide, I only look at the actual gem number and decide whether I want to pay that amount. I guess I'm used to it because retail stores in my country do it all the time. 
---
&gt; I mean there is a reason why nearly all multiplayer games now have some form of progression.
---
Yes there certainly is: it keeps players active without requiring substantial design or content commitment/investment.  If you can lead someone with a carrot, why trouble yourself offering a meal?
---
&gt; repeating the same content isn't fun because it doesn't get any harder or change.
---
Well, that depends on the content.  I have lots of games I play repeatedly long-term because their game play is fun and rewarding.  Those games don't need change, because they are genuinely fun.  I support wanting change, though.  Change and new things to enjoy are good.  I support wanting harder.  Harder has value to many, and is rewarding to achieve and overcome.
---
The thing is, *progression* is not any of that.  "Harder" is not them having bigger numbers until you also have bigger numbers, and numbers changing is not the game experience changing.  A lot of gaming has lost this key concept, because progression is much easier to produce, maintain, and monetize.
---
&gt; What is so offensive to people about this? That some people might do more damage than them in the same group? They already do!
---
It simply *has no actual value* beyond creating a meaningless chase for players to pretend they get something from.  It does have an array of drawbacks, like gating content against ever more players, obsoleting content, fracturing content, creating divisiveness in the players, fueling arrogance and competition, and so on.  It doesn't have the slightest thing to do with who is posting bigger numbers, as you can obviously realize.
---
15.2. -WvW announcement has been delayed by 1 week due to bad weather.
---
Confirmed on Guild Wars 2's official Twitch!
---
 22. 2.- 
---
Today's livestream was cancelled, we're sorry about the inconvenience!
---
announcing than  announce of new announcement was canceled due to weather.
---
either way,there 0 reason to belive that next week we actualy get anything.
---
First you wanted more free gold from dailies, now you want free mounts?  Does the griffon and beetle not satisfy your PvE urges that you want more?
---
Tbh that’s as likely to be PR speak as “gw2 will not be effected”. 
---
How would he do that? A pop-up book?
---
&gt;Anet still has more employees than nearly any other MMO. If they can't do it with 300 they cant do it at all.
---
...With how things have been going until now then I would be concerned, if your statement holds true.
---
I have played GW2, XIV, and WoW, and while XIV does indeed have a consistent and steady stream of content, and the *apparent* quality of that content is good, it isn't deep content at all and that is probably the main reason they are able to churn stuff out so much. This is personified by the # of 4-man dungeons XIV has released, at nearly 3x as many as WoW. Every dungeon on XIV is the same trash-boss-trash-boss-trash-boss roller coaster with different wallpaper each time. Additionally, half that time they are not *new* dungeons, but dungeons that are remade using the assets of a previous dungeon. They will usually have a remixed song and sometimes a new boss, but they are substantially less effort/investment to develop than a new dungeon. Most people I know that play XIV long-term do not get excited about the dungeon content. It's there, it gives weekly tokens, you get tired of them pretty much in the first day. They do virtually nothing to keep it interesting or relieve the tedium. They typically lose their luster after only one run.
---
Similarly, XIV has released more classes but its classes are incredibly simplistic compared to its competitors and they do not have specializations at all. So again, here's 6 XIV classes for 1 WoW class. WoW is the easiest comparison because when you're getting a class on WoW, you are getting 3 (usually...) different specs for the same class, most of which are sufficiently distinct from eachother. This is not the case on XIV. There's no specs on XIV. They tend to follow the same "Delivers an attack with a potency of 300" cookie sheet the other classes do. Sometimes they're shameless clones of existing classes (DRK is far too similar to PLD, and AST is literally a mix of WHM and SCH with some card off-globals.) This again presents deceptive data: while they do add more classes on XIV and it is technically content to level those classes, the quality of that content is far below the quality of a WoW or GW2 class especially.
---
As an aside, it's comedic that XIV added the least open world maps of the three because they're also the worst quality by far. They're borderline empty and seem to serve no purpose other than a container for Main Story Quests and gathering.
---
Well, we only wish the best for him, but we also wish current employees of Anet can overcome this semi dramatic layoff and perform better.
---
I think the story itself is fun to do but they're doing a poor job at populating the newer maps with incentives to do things outside of just the personal story. The LS3 maps don't have this issue quite as badly, but the LS4 ones definitely do. Yet the LS4 story itself is far more engaging than the LS3 one was. So there are strengths with both.
---
Now to answer the title of the thread itself, I'd say that overall if you factor in the fact that essentially nothing is being done for the game content-wise *outside* of the living world, then yeah it's not good for the game. I think that a MMO personal storyline should be supplementing the content additions, not the primary and sole focus of all of them.
---
Killing the dragon was a mistake. Look at us now the world is falling apart (including anet) D:
---
That's a step in the right direction to me. Are they still putting RNG cosmetics behind black lion chests though? Are gemstore outfit effects still more customizable than legendary armor?
---
Argus wasn't three zones, just one split into three parts.
---
Can I have your stuff? Asking for a friend.
---
Some of you need to get over it, gw2 has past its peak and over time will go the way of wildstar.
---
Jair Bolsonaro is a herald of Kralky confirmed.
---
Right, and if they keep their normal dev flair, what's keeping the laid-off/left/fired employee from posting and spreading rumours in the future? *Especially* when they've been fired.
---
Removing their dev tag is a clean and simple solution to the problem. Doesn't require personalised tags that say when the dev left that a mod has to assign individually.
---
And what about if the dev is rehired in the future? What about the comments they may or may not have made when they *weren't* a dev?
---
The currently process is hardly a problem, why make it more complicated?
---
I greatly appreciate your offer. &lt;3
---
Asians are stupid that way and prefer phones to full fledged computers and I say good for them but hell no in NA.
---
Wouldn't specializations count as "new classes"?  
---
After, despite the core traits, gameplay changes A LOT between specializations.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also, this table seens to ignore the "old-content" issue that GW2 doesn't have.
---
Outside our lvl 1-80 Personal history and Tyrian Dungeons, GW2 has virtually no old-content.
---
On games like FFXIV, pretty much everything below the current level cap, and even some expansion dungeons are classified as old-content. 
---
WoW suffers from the same problem as well.
---
Go suck an EGG you corporate shill snakey oily haired FUCK
---
&gt;It doesn't matter that I learn everything about raids if I don't get the chance to use it. There is no killproof given from watching videos. 
---
True, I still can join raids without killproof, just don't give up and keep joining. Join and ask them first if they have KP requirements. In the end the unfortunate part is that a lot of people really suck at raids (Talking about regular raiders here), hence all the KP requirements. Even so, that's the only way to get into raiding. To just keep joining groups and going for it. Join a raiding group etc etc. 
---
&gt;Cool, next you'll tell me that you need is infinite dodge. 
---
Not at all, yes certain classes would be easier to survive, what class do you play? Yes it can be annoying but it isn't to the point where it's that bad. What's bad are the stupid birds especially if you play any channel class, good luck casting a meteor shower with that.
---
&gt;Yet, barely anyone cares about builds or kill proofs in Fractals 
---
You don't see the multiple, 50 ess, LNHB bla bla groups in fractal LFG? 
---
There are equally also those which don't require any at all just "T4 dailies"
---
Again for your last point, T3s -&gt; T4s shouldn't be that bad. Just join a group without description and go do them. 
---
Let's downvote the obviously sarcastic guy!!
---
You’re all leaving just because some people are being laid off?  They still have 200 working on the game.  That’s a VERY significant amount of people, especially for an older MMO that is already built and full featured.  Think they’re going to just sit around and twiddle their thumbs while on a payroll?  How about wait and see what happens with the game before you jump to conclusions?  
---
This is deeply saddening, to lose someone who's brought so much joy to their guild and to the community.
---
I often find in my company that project managers are the scapegoats for the business.
---
Most recently (as a developer) I sat in a meeting and said:
---
"You can't have this project by May, there is too much work, it is literally impossible to code all this by May"
---
The business owner said:
---
"Well, we have to find a way, it will be done by May because we promised our customers May"
---
So now the project manager has been handed the task of making an impossible amount of work arrive by May.
---
Guess who gets the blame when it doesn't arrive by May?  Not the business owner that was told it was an impossibility, the PM gets the blame for not making magic happen.
---
The business and upper management are the real problem.
---
Like most online games in general these days.  Everyone wants to play alone but be around other people.  What a time to be alive.  
---
Raids weren't the direct issue. The issue was that Anet couldn't handle raids, fractals, LS, ex-packs, WvW, and PvP. This is why Ncsoft is most likely stepping in. It is because Anet is not doing a good job.
---
I disagree about not including elite specs. Not including elite specs at all is a huge disservice to GW2 since so much effort goes into them. Each expansion every class in GW2 gets a whole new way to play. That is something the other games do not have and it's a major draw for GW2. Not including them at all isn't fair. That's a huge amount of new abilities and builds for players to play with. Far more than when another game adds a single new class in an expansion.
---
Plus, if you use the elite specs new weapon and all their utilities and ultimate then in moment-to-moment gameplay it does indeed feel like an entire new class.
---
My guess is that the new maps and the story instances take the most work.
---
The maps are huge and while they don't have big or complex meta events there is some stuff that has to be added. (A lot of art work + some programming)
---
And story instances certainly require much more work than previously. LWS4 has a shitton instances with "unique" looks and mechanics.
---
EP1 with fucking Fahranur which is pretty big with several unique mechanics and fights.
---
EP2 with the infiltration of a inquest base, the escape of a infiltration  and the attack on Rata Primus. Stealth, a lot of explosions and effects and a "unique" final fight.
---
EP3 with that incredible long instance in which you setup everything so your "army" can enter the map and the final instance with puzzles and fights.
---
EP4 with that sniper instance and the final instance in the mists where everything falls apart and you have to escape with your mount.
---
EP5 with another visit to glints lair and the huge fight against Kralkatorrik.
---
I probably missed a few but these seemed to be the big ones. Every single episode has usually 2 big instances which have unique mechanics, are set in a new location ("map") or both. Compared to previous seasons (and HoT) this is new. And while they are awesome the first time around they offer almost no replayability.
---
I actually enjoy the story personally, I always make sure to come back to see it even if I hadn’t been playing the actual game for a bit. 
---
My main problem lately is the fact the maps don’t have good replayability.
---
Mel was also a fellow raider of our static group, Extwa Cwispeh. Her Chrono skills were fantastic, and she was a blast to have come along. Seeing her go... it’s saddening, and it’s affected all of us.
---
I’ll be attending the memorial when it arrives, and hope to see the others there for it. May Mel find peace wherever she’s gone off to...
---
Yay!
---
The three parts of Argus were each fairly sizable zones, with each having a large quest chain, side quest chains, a dozens active world quests, unique architecture and appearance.
---
I'd say that, as far as patch zones went, it was three new zones.
---
It was thanks to her and DTOP that I managed to finish making Mawdrey. My heart goes out to her and those she was close to.
---
Unfortunately not, did 3 dungeon stories tonight and almost every dialogue scene had this bug.
---
Gw2 doesnt have a sub though compared to other MMOs. I love gw2
---
Ionized?
---
Actually i like that one :3
---
Yup, thats the one im talkin about ^^"
---
FYI [Artem Sorokin](https://twitter.com/Artagah/status/1100194971783553024) is a VFX artist. He worked on the PoF legendary specializations, Gen 2 leggy weapons, multiple armor sets and other MTX stuff.
---
Yeah i guess every company is different.  We would need to find out how arenanet works internally before we assume it's the PMs.
---
It might very well refer to not gagging JP with a restraining order ASAP (maybe even before canning her), and the Kung Fu Tea fuckups.
---
Lol you’re stupid for even asking that
---
Considering we lost some of the most important devs, mainly the fractal/raid and WvW one I'd say it's a good time to panic.
---
No one cares about 300 worker ants, the big bosses are all out.
---
This probably includes the table
---
We (HeEt) always used to see you guys around when doing our guild missions.  Sad to hear.  You have our condolences.  Maybe some of us can make it.  
---
There was nothing unique, two typical Legion parts with black and green and the same buildings as in any other zone and then Mac'Aree that just reused Talador from WoD. If you mean that they were unlocked separately, I can safely call Dry Top or Silverwastes three zones each.
---
first of, my condolences.
---
second, two questions. how old was her? and NA or EU? 
---
Agree there were 400 employees working on more then GW2, besides it's hard to imagine that many people working on GW2 given what they produce heck even 300 employees working on GW2 seems unlikely. 
---
This certainly isnt a maintenance mode skeleton crew with 300 employees there's a good chance with the shift of positions and priorities GW2 might produce more content more often. 
---
It reminds me a bit of SWTOR BW shift a lot of Senior Devs to Anthem which cost SWTOR greatly and likely is part of the reason they are in a bad spot now. 
---
Although Bree on MassivelyOP did say she heard ANet or NCSoft thought GW2 would be winding down by now but they still made more money then they expected,  according to the earnings call, just not enough for 1 game to support multiple projects and 400 employees considering salaries, health insurance ect. I believe in the podcast Bree said ANet made $70 mill last year with an xpac to boost revenue. She also noted word is management at ANet is part of the problem this isnt all on NCSoft. 
---
Note most of that comes from what Massively said I might have gotten some of the numbers wrong. 
---
You people aren’t accounting for INFLATION, hello! If things were different Anet would be in a much better place, and their money would look way higher than it shows on this graph. You have to remember to take that in to consideration before claiming anet is doing bad, they’ve actually always been profitable, as it shows on this graphical.

foresight isn't exactly a skill in arenanet management repertoire 
---
Hey buddy, I'm really sorry to let you down but I don' think videos are likely to come from me.
---
First of all, I've not been playing GW2 very much at all lately - the past 2 weeks I've literally only logged in for my weekly raid clears. I'm probably going to be taking a break from GW2 as a whole for a while. I'm kinda waiting on the news about the next updates for the game.
---
If I was going to record a world completion, I'd want the recording to be equal to or better than my current record. Sadly I've been "not in the mood" to go for speed with my last 2 world completions so they've been intentionally slow and something that I wouldn't want to record and show off as an example of a speed-clear.
---
Thanks for nothing.
---
Considering Battle Royale and "Hero Shooters" are FPS gamemodes, it's not really at all feasible to implement within GW2. And considering the codebase is said to be a kludgey mess, working with it to implement such an alien system would be horrible.
---
From a profitability standpoint, ArenaNet had the right idea going after mobile. That market is huge and has far lower expectations in terms of visual fidelity relative to PC/Console. The problem is coming up with something that people will want to play.
---
Their best move as a last-ditch attempt to ship something probably would've been to make a GW-themed Autochess clone before the market is flooded with them.
---
Take a look at r/guildrecruitment, guilds will post there pretty often
---
Every community does that. I'm starting to think more and more that their entire response to the Heart of Thorns fiasco and "Show, Not Tell" was merely a way to prepare them for these staff and resource reductions. They didn't want to say we were getting something, because they knew at best case - we continue to get the same style content we have been by working the few people left to death keeping up somekind of pace and consistency, and worst-case - they scrap things here and there and never really know what is actually going to get done.. and realize it's a more likely scenario given the reduction. I mean, obviously the former is kind of common sense and people are still complaining about legendary weapons not being released, but people make those kinds of complaints in any game.. or just for any service in general. That's just how people are. I think developing this really tight silence policy was more of a way to preemptively manage player expectations while knowing they would ultimately be siphoning as much as possible to get these other projects up and running. At this point, people are going to be far angrier and it will hurt them a lot more if they don't provide somekind of hope/teaser/elaborate statement about the future. And despite how extremely frustrated I am that they've been pulling so much away from the game that I love while emphasizing all of this "quality comes first" crap - knowing they've been pushing the remaining teams harder and harder so they can continue to focus on these side projects I would most likely have little interest in to begin with, as long as they keep producing new content I'll more than likely stop in and play it. It's just sad to think about where we could be right now if this entire situation was handled better to begin with, like not switching your focus off of your main title to a bunch of side projects. I mean, what player wants to get involved with a game that even its creators aren't passionate enough about to fully focus on, and what prospective applicant wants to get involved with a company that makes such risky decisions while pushing their employees to work as hard as humanly possible to keep up the illusion that it still has that focus? It just looks bad in general. And now because of those decisions we have 100 plus people out of work and a really great game now in a completely questionable state. Arenanet for sure has some of the most talented people in the industry, and to have to lose any of them is a shame. Especially when it feels like it could have been avoided or at the very least on a much smaller scale. Did someone at some point just say, "meh - this game really isn't going anywhere so let's just make two others." I just don't understand the reasoning behind shifting focus from a game with still so much potential instead of leaving said game as the priority and putting less focus on the other projects. Did they think the living story model was just enough in general for the rest of this game? I mean, it might be, if they had a reliable cadence, more resources, more staff, and more focus. 
---
It's just a shame. It's all such a shame. For everyone. And perhaps Josh and some of the others had lost their passion for the game in general, but to lose so much talent and so many people from a game that's always been persistently innovative in everything that they do, just leaves me with the feeling that even with the most detailed roadmap in the world, will this game really be the same? We've already had some pretty noticeable issues this season, and whether it gets a full 300 people back and dedicated to it or not, will it leave me with the same sense of wonder and amazement? Or will it just be streamlined soulless content for the sake of content updates. I hope the art team has remained though. Because even if they aren't overly exciting to play or replay, the maps and assets have always been breathtaking and beautifully detailed. 
---
Probably but now i'm not so sure.
---
FFXIV is growing at a much faster pace than GW2, we started with a big head start but they've caught up in the past few years.
---
Please let this also mean the end of these terribly done comics...
---
I am sure you can express your disagreement in perfect Korean.
---
If anet was overstaffed and still can't manage to release content and updates in a timely manner and they just cut a bunch of staff, then the game really is fucked.
---
I left the company a while ago, I do contract with them sometimes. I just have friends there, my husband still works there... It has hit it harder than what I had expected. Lots of familiar faces will not be there anymore, and I had no chance to say good bye to some. 
---
I know the company, and GW2 will be ok. It i just hard knowing that you had no chance to party with some people before they move on. 
---
So according to the earnings call GW2 brought in $71 million last year. That's still a lot of revenue, not for NCSoft but for ANet it's still profitable and their only current profit generating game.
---
Shows your agony resistance 
---
The best staff rotation I found for cc works best with Fresh Air, but is otherwise not worth it unless it's the start of a fight.
---
Air/Water for the chill spam, into Earth/Air for Pile Driver and Eruption, into Fire/Earth to get back into rotation. You could use the elite skill to speed it all up, but otherwise you're looking at about 12 seconds of rotation downtime...
---
You mean the hype that got exaggerated, then the company failed to deliver what they hyped?
---
Anet has been fucking things up since day one; this is their fault.
---
You're correct. The Console Games Wiki lists it as IL355 for some reason. Thankfully Garland Tools and Gamer Escape have the correct IL. Thanks for pointing out my mistake!
---
I am glad you are doing well, and I hope your husband and friends will get to spend some time together, initiate ways to keep in touch.
---
I'm not going to be able to make this memorial due to a schedule conflict... but I offer my condolences, and I hope the turnout is a big one.
---
Stay strong, Moon, and everyone who knew Melora.
---
I am so very sorry to hear this. &lt;3 :(
---
She was 39 when she passed away, and this is an NA based event.
---
What’s considered peak hours?
---
I had this problem in my Arah run. Support sadly gave me a generic response, but I did find a thread on the forums regarding it. Seems to be mostly Zojja.
---
*If* the warclaw is not just a mount hastily thrown into WvW but actually balanced and designed for WvW (which many of us for some reason hope), it will be hardcapped at 400 speed, have high cd on mobility/attack skills, low hitpoints so its easy to dismount enemies and overall low damage on its pounce/door pull.
---
There would be absolutely zero point to use this in PvE over any other mount.
---
If we assume that it wouldnt have all these flaws... then why would we ever want a griffon with no wings?
---
Sad stuff might come and might also get a standing desk for home

I spend so much time looking through the wardrobe trying different combos, it’s honestly ridiculous :p

Sometimes reading comments it seems that many people have never played an MMO before. All MMOs die. Sooner or later. Dungeon Runners, Raiderz, Aion, Dekaron, so many died after so many years. But, some veteran players know where to find them again. Google them. Not really all games die. For example, Knight Online is an old korean pvp game that had thousands of players on its peak and now it's the same non-updated thing that has been for almost 15 years but some private servers are doing what developers couldn't for years. Now, GW2 isn't going to die anytime soon. A lot of people are referring to new mmos like ESO or FF. Go to their forums. They have complains too. The grass always look greener...you know.  
---
If you don't like GW2 anymore and this whole thing is stressing you out, I recommend to stop playing and do something else. We all invested in a MMO (I'm 36 yo) and when games die we only have our screenshots and friends, now we're in Gw2 having fun, if you're not having fun, then you should look somewhere else instead of just being toxic in-game and ruining other's people fun.

My deepest condolences.

Fear not this night. You will not go astray.

Ooh I love the neutral colors on him and the accompanying blue for the dragon hunter. Hes very handsome U wU
---
Didn’t have the opportunity to meet her in game but I’m so sorry to hear this :( 
---
Gonna do my best to make it on Sunday cuz I love this community ❤️
---
The mounts alone is worth it and they won't shut down the servers anytime soon. That being said... I'm ok with people not spending money until we figure out what the long term future is.
---
I never claimed I was an authority figure, but I have played Aion before and other NCSoft published/developed games and those of us that have know how they are better than those that know nothing about them.
---
There is a big difference between being educated on the subject and on the company in question than simply seeing them as some kind of savior due to actions that seemed like a godsend on their part. Will Guild Wars 2 be better for it? Again, we don't know. For all we know, they will, but then again, knowing NCSoft, I am very uneasy. They follow the pay2win mindset of mobile games and they have taken that route with most of their games. It's a scary thought to think GW2 might end up in that direction.
---
&gt;If a new player is only concerned with the Main Scenario Quests, regular Raids, and Alliance Raids, then all they need is the IL360 gear from the 29 January 2018 Patch 4.2 last year which is very easily obtainable.
---
The instantaneous response to this is then: "So they're designing content that the majority of their player base will never play and always be behind?" to which the answer is yes, and that's fine. It's a normal design element in MMORPGs. GW2 has this as well, but generally things are very approachable for anyone interested. Sometimes it's just a matter of taking initiative to start the group for it.
---
I understand that not having min/maxed gear does not make/break encounters and often enough they are designed to accommodate players that have a mixed set of newer and older. i.e. enrage timers or fail mechanics tied to having specific gear stats are generally more lenient than "BiS or wipe" for raid encounters. So if you have people in one of the newer raids without full ilvl 390/400, you're still going to be okay for the most part. Your tank isn't going to get one shot for missing a few pieces.
---
Regardless, that current BiS will no longer be BiS within the scope of 3-6 months. That's the key difference I was getting at between GW2's horizontal progression model vs. the vertical aka loot treadmill model.
---
One of the things I really did like about FFXIV is that it handled down-leveling characters fairly well. There was some goofy shit when I was playing where you could kind of game the system to have higher stats by taking off some equipment pieces but it wasn't super substantial. I think GW2 kind of had the same issue in Dungeons at some point where in certain ones it was better to use Exotic rather than Ascended. However, unless I'm remembering wrong or things have changed, there really isn't any reason to return to lower level content aside from the dungeons such as the open world leveling areas *unless* you were working on a new sub-class.
---
I think FFXIV is a great game, but my personal gripe is that I just can't justify a monthly sub any more when I have so many other games to play. It's hard to invest yourself into more than one MMORPG to start with, so I really like that with GW2 I can drop it for extended periods of time and I won't feel left behind.
---
*Hewwo sushi drake!* It's your **5th Cakeday** Rainwhisker! ^(hug)
---
I mean I had to actually look up what the specific mission is about and adjust build. There were specific classes roles taken as well. Taking a few newbies being told where to stand didn't really happen.
---
Looks sick, probably just artistic freedom and not something ever implemented into the game, or at least implemented with the same quality.
---
Source?

Thanks I hate it.

Yeah... no.

I'm not sure anyone in [DTOP] would even know this, but when she first started on GW2 she was in my guild and spent a long time there before Dry Top was even released! She eventually left my guild to move on to [DTOP] because she wanted to lead bigger events with bigger groups, but she and I always stayed close and chatted every so often. It's really sad to hear that she passed on, and I'll definitely make an attempt to be at the memorial service if at all humanly possible.
---
That’s a good word
---
I was working on it earlier tonight and enjoyed what I got done, but had to go suddenly in the middle. It’s a fun jp! And to the Mesmer who helped me out: you’re still amazing and I really appreciate the ports and patience!
---
I think Anet's problems started with the Cap to AP's
---
Why'd you say I wanted to halt discussions? I never said that. You're making it sound like I'm some kind of nutjob from the cold war who's warning people of the red menace. Lol.
---
And yes, unions can be as corrupt as any other organization.
---
And yes, unions are not a strict benefit for workers or even consumers. Teachers unions in many countries are a good example of this. Their salaries are fixed based on post-secondary education and number of years served. There's no incentive for them to do anything better than not get fired because they won't get raises because of it. And their fixed salaries are often shitty, but they have no personal negotiating power because the union itself has to negotiate on behalf of everyone before that can happen.
---
And no, a union will not magic-wand away inflated executive compensation in North America. So I don't even know why this organization is pounding their chest as if they'll strip that compensation and give it to workers.
---
You get collective bargaining power which might help against massive layoffs, but collective bargaining also means slow and impersonal bargaining. It makes things safer but moves them away from a meritocracy. Some people find this okay. Depending on a union's terms I might not because I've had enough success bargaining for myself.
---
I started my 3th map completion with tekkits pack ofc. i have the feeling hearts really slow me down. anybody has experience with skipping all hearts and coming back for them later?
---
It's not likely that NCSoft picked Gaile or anyone else by name to be laid off. They most likely said cut x per cent or x headcount and left ANet to figure it out.
---
Given that Josh Foreman is no longer with ANet, and that he was the main designer behind Jumping Puzzles, it's far less likely than it was a week ago.  :(
---
I just finished it again earlier today. It was really quite enjoyable; the jumps were (beyond a couple leaps of faith) intuitive enough that I didn't need a guide or anything. 
---
The fact the ship catches on fire when you reach the end is really cool, too. 
---
My favorite cutscene is the big nose ted cutscene. Some of the game’s much stronger enemies don’t even get their own cutscene but this lad has his own. Proves that you don’t need to be a god eating dragon to make big.
---
“Let’s play who can hit the hardest. I’ll go first!” -the very champion of the people himself, Big Nose Ted

I needed that. Thanks

I've also played GW2 and made a few posts, not not in a year.

I thought ANet nerfed that perk like 5 times what gives? May as well remove pulm from Daredevil, clearly OP
---
I agree with this - LWS doesn't really bring much except 2 hours of story content and a new one mastery to instantly purchase after getting the XP. 
---
At least, practically; I know some players like to get all the achievements, etc. But in terms of actual importance to gameplay, that's it. And it only drops every 3 months.
---
Don't worry to much, i'm pretty somebody will still tag up when you'll be back home. :-)

A DVT/PE can't cause a stroke unless you have a hole in your heart.

Only 39?  ._.

So young.  She didn't deserve that.   I wonder how her over all health was leading up to that point.
---
&gt; predatory monetization models
---
I'd probably still be on Blade &amp; Soul had it not been for their absolutely retarded p2w schemes. At least GW2 doesn't make me feel like I *have* to spend money. I can take breaks from this game and not suffer consequences for it.
---
Yes indeed, i for some reason red it as if you wanted to connect to people who were gone.
---
The majority of the player base (mostly have no idea about such places as forums, reddit, never watched the streams - me inc.) never knew the devs or had any interaction with them, outside of rare encounters in-game. Probably, don't even know about the layoffs situation. And this is quite normal. 
---
There was never a need to know who (on a personal level) makes the most of things I consume, for example one's never interested who are people who prep food in McDonald's, who produce Coke they drink, who makes the car they drive, who made the games we play. As consumers, we (the most of us) do not need this, we just follow (blindly or not) the brand name and other consumer reviews. After-all that's what brands are for.
---
And of course there are exceptions, it is always cool to know the owner of your local pub, or a guy who makes a pizza in your favorite place. This is mostly true for smaller firms. Also, some "vocal minority" members such as Yourself will always feel positive about possibility for such interactions.
---
So how do you reconnect? Same way as with previous staff, you see what they have to offer, streams, forum posts, or nothing and decide accordingly as if you want to participate. 
---
Oh please. "Death spiral". GW2 is profitable. Just not as profitable as it should be. 
---
And you have no idea what criteria they used to choose the 25%. At least some of those highly paid people chose to take voluntary severance. Whether or not they were the ones doing most of the work, we do not know.
---
I remember seeing her stand around on her Ranger iirc in GW1 and it was always such a woooooah feeling as a kid :(
---
Yea kinda sucks that we might be seeing some jumping puzzles for a while :./
---
i highly depends which real person you will actually get. what is "impossible" for one support staff member, is done in 5 minutes by another. its like a lootbox actually.
---
It's the [Vigil's Honor Headguard](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vigil%27s_Honor_Headguard) - I've had it on for a few weeks and it was fine, It's only visible to me. Meaning something is probably corrupt on my end and I'm going to have to reinstall.
---
Crafting is only really profitable in high volume as people pay for the convenience. 
---
Of course hes going to say stuff like that, if he badmouthed them he'd have a hard time getting hired somewhere new.
---
Is that Adam Lambert? O.o
---
A decade is 10 years ago GW2 hasn't been out for 10 years.
---
My condolences from a Belgium player! 
---
The buy and sell orders are really low (like sub 10 on most) but even at the buy price it's around 2x the crafting cost so idk. If you have the recipe it looks like easy money but it's a really small market. 
---
Edit: responded to the wrong question before.
---
"Always wait for a sale" is the standard advice I give anyone who asks.

Arenanet has always seemed like a company that throws a bunch of spaghetti at a wall to see what sticks. But then they changed their mind and throw more spaghetti. They have a big lack of follow-through with anything but a ton of new ideas. It's a bad analogy I know, I think I just want spaghetti
---
Early access is one thing. Playing a game for 6 years that's been super stale for the last year and a half and has a questionable future is another. No thx I ain't spending another penny on this game until I see some clear information about the future of this game.
---
It possible to run Alacrigade without Quickbrandbut if you had to chose to only have 1 I would probably get the Quickbrand.
---
In fractals you can run a Power Quickbrand btw instead of the condi version. If you are doing T4 then the Mobility potion bonus concentration is enough to make you cover 100% Quickness without anything else.
---
If you are in lower tiers then going for a slightly modified version of this would work nicely too (changing runes and maybe a sigil) because then I suppose you won't have/take fractal potions there.
---
In lower tiers (T1-T2) I would say nothing matters much as the content is easy but Power will work even better than condi because mobs have even lower HP and armor than in T4. In those tiers people will usually not have many boons on them because no one was specifically recruited for that so power Herald (with mostly full zerk) could be even more useful for your group while still giving a very nice DPS for this tier. With it you can give quick a nice amount of speed, might, fury, regen and prot while still playing rev if that' what you wanna play! Be advised that this build will lose in efficiency/usefulness as you go higher in tiers and start  having more interesting/powerful group composition (instead of having 5 random people).
---
I am sorry for your loss but maybe you want to remove her real name as its still personal and confidental information.
---
These are not inflation adjusted I don't think just the flat figures, once you add inflation in 2016 was almost the same as 2018
---
Its time to make new "Friends" Times change, life changes, people come in and out of our lives, if you call this game that. Just like every day everywhere and everyone. We move forward with our lives or in this case gaming. I am not sure what connection you really think you had with these people. Some of them were more public than others. They are still who they are and will go to work at other places on other projects. You will be able to go worship them there. 
---
Having a DVT/PE [greatly increases](https://www.webmd.com/dvt/news/20071126/dvt-tied-to-heart-attack-stroke-risk) your risk of having a stroke.
---
As people said it is agony resistace which is something they made visible not long ago. We asked for this to be implemented for years because ever so often it happen that players tried to bypass this to join a group and it was not obviouse until we got in to the fractal and they started to die to agony which kind of wasted peoples time. 
---
Now you can see it in the lobby which pretty much stopped the issue and when someone is low  on ar or have none it is usually because they forgot to swap gear or weapons and is easy fixed. The aggro in the group around the subject with the person trying to bypass pretty much vannished since then.
---
Not to mention the abysmal battery drain that any worth-a-damn graphics would cause. My guess is most of the "hardcore" mobile gamers spend a lot of time plugged into the wall.
---
Lws5 is still supposed to come, that alone is a roadmap for a big part of 2020 already. Not saying i am fine with the current amount of communication (pre ragnarok) but damn people, stop acting like we have nothing to look forward to after the lws4 finale.
---
yeah, bullfuckingshit.
---
the answer isnt to just sigh, give up, and try to save yourself until everything collapses. Its to fucking do aomething abiout CEOs making more money than most of their employees combined for doing less work than those employees.
---
While it's true that these kind of posts that you're talking about completely unnecessary, I don't understand why these kind of attitudes are ridiculuous. People can decide where the put their money. Just because the game is in a bad state we shouldn't dump money in it. Don't judge me, I love GW2 but the last 1-1,5 years examples show that they didn't use that kind of money too wisely. It can be due to NcSoft's policy, I don't care, not my business. What my point is, they seemed to be always on point with delivering gemstore items, skin bundles, etc, but nowhere near meeting a consinsent shipping cadence in terms of acutal ingame content. If they had always been true to their initial promises and plans, it would be a reasonable plan to support them in times of crises and uncertainty. But thats, sadly, not the case. If I see a truly promising early Access game that has potential then I'm not shy to dump money into it, but so far ArenaNet (7 years of experience) showed that they got stuck in neverland in terms of promises and implenetation.
---
&gt;I doubt a lot of you haven't spend money on a bunch of early access games with no future in your steam accounts
---
At least I have a bugged game. If they shut down GW2 I have nothing.
---
This is my favorite jumping puzzle in the whole game. There are no arbitrarily challenging parts, and it makes you think about how you're going to get from A-B more than most of them do. 
---
Thank you! The hysteria is so overreactive it's boardering on cringeworthy. People just need to chill the fuck out and look at what we DO KNOW. And so far, based off of what we DO KNOW, nothing will negatively impact the human resource allocation for GW2.
---
Clearly I'm talking about the roadmap since its commented under that thread. 
---
Can you explain to me how exactly you came to the conclusion that I was talking about an expansion since I made no mention of it.
---
It's not tthe only "meta-achievement" like that. Many in episodes can be completed with a few extra left, so that you chose what's more convenient at the time.
---
Uh, its a business. Revenue is ALWAYS a concern. Sure they made money but did they make ENOUGH money.
---
It is a real shame that jumping puzzles weren't continued as strongly in LS4 as they were in LS3. They were one of the most unique pieces of content when considering MMOs though I guess the focusing on side projects is why LS4 didn't see any. 
---
Yeah it's not simple.
---
Releasing the code of dead games to the community is my wildest dream as well but it would be problematic IMO.
---
As it stands now, IP owners retain all their ownership and emulating a dead game is still a copyright violation but it's legally allowed if you do it to preserve a game, not to monetize it.
---
The moment you start getting money out of it you can be prosecuted.
---
That is simple enough to verify because noone has the original code and stealing the code is a different crime that also applies to emulation. That makes it also easy for IP owners to get back into business with a dead game/version if they want to (look at Blizzard re-releasing vanilla WoW).
---
The moment you release the original code it may become a titanic effort to check who does what with it, you lose out on the "piracy deterrent" and it may become difficult to get back into business in case they want to do it because you'd have to fight against a community that is very good and has more manpower to fix broken stuff in your code (look at Gothic/Skyrim for example, the community has been able to fix a lot of bugs *without* having access to the original code, imagine what they could do if they did have the code).
---
Releasing the code would also expose a company to all sorts of hacks if they get back into business, because knowing exactly how the original code works makes it a joke to write bots/hacks/whatever for it.
---
Actually read the post? This is one of the worst things you can say about someone who passed away and a group of people care about.
---
Please, for your sake, grow up. 
---
You're right, they are very convenient for casual gamers. However, one long look at  (most of) their business models and reward systems and you can see a large, glaring reason: They are casinos. 
---
In 2016 Americans alone spent 76 billion USD on card games, dice, and flashing lights. It isn't exactly a new model. The difference is, they couch it all in some game mechanics that are "free to play", and then flash their addictive little lights, microrewards, and integrated "meme" content. Sounds an awful lot like the "free" services or credits that casinos offer their patrons.
---
Yes, mobile games are popular because they are portable, convenient, etc. Let's be real though; that isn't why they are the global sensation that they are.
---
But do we need 500 posts about every person who is spending or not spending though?
---
In my eye the game's future is uncertain, so I certainly won't spend any money on it anytime soon. 
---
If they make an expansion, then I will decide if the expansion content is interesting enough for me to get invested in gw2 again. 
---
Arena Net has been extremely disappointing for the past 3-4 years. The things that I like the most, regular dungeon content and armor sets are rarely added to the game...
---
&gt; Why'd you say I wanted to halt discussions? I never said that. You're making it sound like I'm some kind of nutjob from the cold war who's warning people of the red menace. Lol.
---
No, what they said is you're repeating the talking points of that sort of person and to be careful of that. I think it was pretty clear in their post that they didn't actually think it was an intentional move on your part.
---
&gt; And yes, unions are not a strict benefit for workers or even consumers.
---
On average they absolutely are. The evidence is very clear on that. Of course that doesn't preclude individual unions from failing their members, but the cool thing about unions is they're democratic so if the leadership is failing you, you can vote in replacements.
---
&gt; They got burned because they didn't focus on things that should have
---
I really wish people would understand this. They tried to stretch their dev team to work on other projects and do the bare minimum for GW2. The game makes money, its just it could be more if the game had 100% focus, which is why the layoffs is happening.
---
I can't imagine anything other than an xpac coming after LS which is kind of a big invenstment. Esp with some datamines of playing housing awhile back which we weren't sure were real but surely they wouldn't go month by month with no plan for the game when you consider HoT was planned before GW2 even released and "fear not this night" was basically a song about that.
---
They could have done so much with their amazing combat system.... imagine having more dungeons for HoT and PoF along some new raids, shame they didnt embrace it....
---
Temper tantrum? Toddler? For responsibly choosing where my funds go? Haha alright man. 
---
&gt;Before you decide to down vote me to oblivion, LET ME explain.
---
*Checks post history*
---
Yeah, not even gonna bother reading past the first sentence.
---
Lol a fanatic, nice assumptions. Maybe one day you'll sit back on your chair and actually see how annoying those whiny posts are "wah wah i'm not gonna spend money on GW2 cause they don't wanna give me MY favorite thing!111!" Like I dare you go to other game developers and see how you get treated. Anet is literally like a babysitter company.
---
NO. There's a shit ton of PVE stuff that they don't just hand to wvw and pvp players  , isn't there ? Like 99 % of EVERYTHING. It's fine for there to be a cool thing just for wvw , and fine for it to be unlocked through wvw. You're lucky it's even usable in pve at all , even though doing so is pointless.
---
The fact that we haven't seen anything like this in any of the patches this season implies that Josh probably hasn't had any involvement, or minimal involvement with Guild Wars 2 for quite some time. And that's just another unfortunate thing about their shift of focus to these other projects. Because it's post like this one, and adventures like these in the game, that leave a lasting impression and made it the game people remember. It still could be, but it doesn't feel very likely right now. It's certainly my favorite jumping puzzle though, and arguably we may not see things like this because it doesn't make as much sense with the addition of mounts, but even with that, we have the Jackal Djinn temple in Crystal Oasis and a few more jackal puzzles in The Desolation. We also have the tech to turn off mounts on jumping puzzles, so it's not really a good assumption. So, I'm not sure if the fact that we haven't seen them is an indication that they weren't worth wasting the tight resources/time on, or if they just don't feel that the majority of the player base is interested in them. Or, if they were always more of a passion of Josh, and since he hasn't been having much interaction, nobody really cared enough to try. Oh, and the Kesho jp as well. I guess you could technically classify the dwarven tombs in Thunderhead as a kind of jumping puzzle though, so there's that. (And the unfinished jumping puzzle underneath Istan as well.) So perhaps it's just a matter of them not being deemed worthy of resources and simply cut out of the picture. I imagine, then, that the dwarven tombs and puzzle area in Thunderhead was made more of a priority due to how well received Derelect Delve was in Desert Highlands and it was easier to implement, as well as cheaper to implement. 
---
People losing their jobs. So delicious. /s
---
Caretaker mode from here on likely unless they end up rehiring. Need to keep buying gems like the are going out of fashion to boost revenue.
---
I don't think Josh Foreman made this specific JP. During the charity stream they mentioned one of the female devs worked on it.
---
unironically this though
---
It's the right amount of challenge without being an abstract nightmare like Chalice of Tears. Even Draconis Mons has a few moments where you're like... "How many times did he have to test this jump or move something to make sure that this amount of space was just challenging enough without being impossible." Because from simply making jumping puzzles in the guild hall, that is some time consuming nightmarish shit alone. 
---
I'm not convinced there was ever an expansion 3 being worked on anymore. I used to believe that, but not now. The nagging thought in the back of my mind is that Anet intended to just keep dropping Living Story seasons without an expansion. Because, as you noted, expansions are a big investment and we now know that Anet was already heavily focusing its resources on its non-GW2 projects. This is why people want a roadmap going forward. Even a statement saying, "Yes, there is an expansion in the works. We've been working on this whole time." Because if that isn't the case, that means any potential expansion is going to be starting from scratch and will be releasing two to three years from now. This is why people are worried. This is why people need Anet to communicate clearly and directly about what the future of Guild Wars 2 will entail going fowards.
---
Fear not this night (The elder dragon cycle is natural)
---
You will not go astray (Mordremoth will not corrupt the Sylvari)
---
Though shadows fall (Although Zhaitan will be defeated)
---
Still the stars find their way (The elder dragons still win)
---
They absolutely should put resources elsewhere. They have to, they have to think of the future too. If they didn’t invest money into other projects then they will get to a point where they aren’t making enough money from guild wars anymore and have nothing else to make money from. The fuck up here is that the time and money they put elsewhere didn’t work out for then.
---
And I was really hoping for that GW2 Mobile TP App  ^^/s
---
&gt;In WoW and FFXIV you have to keep playing to keep your characters at the current highest potential. In GW2 you can stop playing for years and your gear is still just as valid. It also means that GW2 technically has more endgame content since dungeons are essentially just as valuable today as they were two years ago (which is a good and bad thing). I think that's a really noticeable difference to factor in.
---
I agree with most but this. Endgame for the average MMORPG player is gearing and upgrading your gearing. Gw2 can be enjoyed more casually than any other MMO without falling too much behind. It has a lot of content but certainly no endgame content. 
---
They have always been very supportive to me and even done extra things to help me. As far as customer support goes these group is one of the best I’ve dealt with.
---
Foreman did not do this. He did mentioned that one of the other devs did this in the past.
---
And its pretty obvious really...this one does not have the sadistic nature of the other two JPs in the season. There are many people that design JPs in Anet. Its not just josh.  
---
Would it be of more conversational value if I came out as a whale supporting this game? I guess whatever supports your cause. But because I disagree that your opinion holds any value specifically over mine I stand firmly by my decision to not invest anymore money into this game until personally my faith is restored in its operations. 
---
Why did you mention the dev was female?
---
I always thought there was more than just one person working on jump puzzles. Still, no doubt Josh was the driving force behind them and come up with a lot of ideas.
---
&gt; I just think it's really shitty to all the people who are still there to bash it here and now
---
Well let's be clear, I'm not doing that.
---
You clearly didn't play COH.
---
This is what NCSoft does, and how they do it. 
---
The first thing that came to my mind though, after seeing that logo without having read the title yet... "eh, now what does James Bond Spectre has to do with anet?"  
---
Uh \*leaves quietly\* :D
---
&lt;3
---
If you like it stay, if you don't like it get out. It's not that hard. The post it about people sitting around seemingly not enjoying the game and bragging about not spending money on it, and worse motivating other to do so as well. This is not beneficial to anyone and is childish.
---
This post tells me Final fantasy is THE BEST mmo on the market, including cost wise. Since autumn 2018 I spent probably 300 dollars on gw2- mounts, lootboxes, skins... final fantasy, which has ALL THAT OR AT LEAST MOST as ingame rewards only cost 650 over 3 years. Soo 5 months 300 dollars in gw2 or 36 months and only 650. Yes, in gw2 its optional however that option costs satisfaction. If I don't pay, I'm just not experiencing the game to the fullest and it issss fasion wars after all, no? I rather pay a sub fee and feel rewarded than feel like I'm beeing scammed all the time.
---
Not to mention, look the amount of end game content. Final fantasy is like the rich kid with lacoste in class in gw2 wears crocks. 
---
"if they keep their normal flair" ... I wrote "IF WE COULD BE 100% SURE [...] I WOULD advocate to keep normal flair". What don't you understand in a conditional sentence ?
---
F
---
Even if P/P DD or DE was a good DPS choice, you would still play in melee range of the boss because of boons, if you play ranged you get none and your damage goes down by a huge amount.
---
Anet had around 400 employees. Last I heard, wow had over 6000 people involved in its creation. No idea about final fantasy.
---
My condolences. ;.;
---
&gt; GW2 content isn't designed to have that longevity
---
Literally all level 80 content that gets added stays level 80 forever lol.
---
Josh choosing his words very carefully here ;) 
---
Not worth it IMO, did it once and it felt like it pretty much was a second World Completion.
---
Screenshot your ingredients.
---
Great time to get into FFXIV!
---
&gt;      
---
&gt; If it takes Anet 3 months to even tell us what they had intended to do after LS5 then the game really is up shit creek without a paddle.
---
A roadmap is not really the same as "here are things we were planning on doing before we lost a quarter of our company".
---
Roadmaps are more than just listing what you want to make, they also provide milestones for when those things should be completed and pushed live.
---
So corporate politics is incomprehensible to you? 
---
Never heard of "Embrace, Extend, Extinguish"? Trust me, companies have been closed down not just for profit motive, but also to dismantle potential competition. Capable employees have not been hired, because at one point they had their own company and HR managers are quick to suspect that these people are just working to get enough capital to start another company.
---
These acts may be rational in the sense that warfare can be seen as rational to those waging it, but often times these decisions are not made with profit, but rather power in mind, be it personal or corporate.
---
As for their side projects: If even one of these had been successfully released, the sudden surge in income would have justified Arenanet. Ultimately gaming is a high risk industry, though. Not every project is going to create a marketable product. Also, maybe they should have tried to hire a smaller studio and publish that side project. This would have allowed them to concentrate on GW2, but publishing other works would have made NC-Soft even more nervous that their Seattle subsidiary is too ambitious. NC-Soft has already damaged Arenanet's kibun (their face) with this action. I doubt that they are on great terms.
---
I haven’t been on in awhile, (Haranu/Regaliana here) but I’ll make it to the memorial. 
---
It depends on what NCsoft wants to fund.
---
They may just decide "well, other investments are worth more to us so if they just keep GW2 going until it isn't worth it anymore that is fine with us" 
---
Yeah he was the one who openly talked about the cantha district and such. 
---
Thanks, that actually worked :D
---
Yeh by "ranged" i meant where elementalist/scourges etc are, not sniffing the boss' ass! :P
---
Yes and the person you are responding to is saying "I hate when people resort to lazy groupings and name calling" 
---
Isn't Swtor heavily restricted for people not subbed or with premium membership?
---
I played it to release and went back after it went f2p and didn't even had all of the race/class choices unlocked.
---
Most populated server by far, honestly can't remember it ever being open (besides at launch).
---
First of all, dagger dagger deadeye is hilariously easy. Literally stand behind boss, press 5, then press 1 until you're not revealed any more. Repeat forever. If you like extra DPS, use your f1 on cd, as well as all your utilities each time shadow flare is off cd. Done. That's the entire rotation. There are ways to improve the above, but they're not necessary. It's the easiest DPS rotation in the meta imo. Whoever told you that it's not noob friendly was joking. The only possible reason I can think someone would unironically say this is because they only get 11k health, but DD isn't any less glassy and most DPS classes are pretty close to being this glassy as well. Low health pools really aren't something you should worry about for DPS in raids though, as you can avoid most damage just with smart positioning/movement and you have a dedicated healer.
---
On to your question:
---
There might be a way to get half decent numbers with ranged daredevil, but you're going to struggle finding it. I'm pretty sure the best you can do won't be much better than spamming unload, and from experience I can tell you the DPS from that is pretty underwhelming.
---
If you're bent on ranged thief, take a look at rifle deadeye instead. Just be aware that it isn't a great choice everywhere.
---
Not sure why you prefer range DPS, but if it's because you feel safer then you'll want to overcome that. In raids it's really rare for the stack not to be in melee range, regardless of whether DPS are ranged or not. If you squirrel off stack to pew pew from a distance, you'll get fewer boons, less healing, do less damage, get downed more often, and generally piss off your squad.
---
So you are saying that they should just bite the bullet and release a F2P with cashshop client to steam for PvP modes that requires a standard log in account and encourages purchasing the full game in game.
---
;) :P 
---
Seriously though, if they had marketed a PvP and WvW client that just kicked new players directly into those modes and made them aware that they could download a different / full client I am sure it would have attracted a wider variety of people.
---
Because as it is even though functionally people can grab a F2P option and play PvP many people not in the know would never think of the game as being able to do that in the first place. 
---
Yep , the layoffs might actually be NCSoft saying " screw those side projects , start kicking out xpacs and content for the game that makes a profit" . That's good news , not bad. According to Price ( who I don't trust to not have an agenda , but..) they were moving devs sneakily away from GW2 for quite a while. Xpacs or other actual content in place of , or in addition to , a focus on the Living World , is very much needed.
---
The most awesome of scaffolding, but with no actual building going on.
---
Same with guild missions, were they REALLY that hard to add to... and if so why?
---
Also, why the hell are jumping puzzles in core tyria not converted to adventures. It is the PERFECT way to keep jumping puzzles in the game post mount/glider introduction 
---
I'm a grown person and as such I've learned the lesson in life is that when you don't tell people when they act like shit stains they will assume it's ok and will continue to act so. I often ignore people cause they're unsavable but boycotting sales is the most retarded thing. Like don't spend money on the game if you don't want to but marketing that idea is helping GW2 how?
---
For the leveling in core Tyria: Ignore condi Damage. Enemies take not that much hits to die and condi builds don't effect structures in core Tyria. (Later they do, but it can become frustrating hitting a passive object for 10 seconds just because your condi damage doesn't apply) So I would recommend Power based equip.
---
Take you time exploring. I would recommend exploring all maps you visit 100%, but some people don't like that. Make sure to do the personal story with your first character. It starts at level 10 and guides you through most of the world.
---
At certain level you will receive a mail showing you the entrance of a dungeon. The first one is at level 30. Every dungeon has a story mode and at least 3 explorer ways. Look for a party to do the story modes as you unlock them. Wait with explorer till level 80. Some people in lfg don't want to run explorer with low level characters, even tho the level requirement for most of them are lower.
---
And after you did all of this, you should be able to find your way around.
---
Sent you a PM.
---
if you are accusing them of being a fanboy they probably meant that in jest. 
---
&gt; Stop with the cross genre minigames that people get bored with in a week.
---
Yes please.  
---
If I wanted to play platformers, I'd go play a platformer game.  
---
If I wanted to play shooters, I'd go play a shooter game.  
---
Etc.
---
Your answer forever when people ask about a girlfriend lmao. 
---
And it gets gilded :)
---
&gt; no anything as long as WoW did it.
---
That was (and is) many player's mindset, not the devs.  
---
The devs mindset was more akin to not doing things that Wow did and that turned out to be actually bad for an MMO.
---
House of Leaves comes to mind.
---
It's good that you prefaced this as an opinion because there's no way you could have substantiated the following claims unless you're somehow an ArenaNet exec or know one personally.
---
1. " most of those employees didn't give any money worth back. "
---
2. "  I am sure I would not be so wrong if I say that at least 200 of employees worked on other projects "
---
3. "GW2 still gets more than enough profit, but it is overshadowed by the expenses of all other projects. "
---
4. " remove 30% of people that worked on it, and suddenly you have more than enough profit to really sustain and develop current games (GW and GW2) you have "
---
I think your opinion will be far more compelling if you stick to just the facts and your own insight instead of making claims you can't cite evidence for.
---
I’ve seen quite a few people mention it’s better to try use gender neutral language and have even seen it discussed on here. I just find it odd that they pointed out the devs sex.
---
Guess it’s all about the money 
---
Do you think Arenanet would have been better off outsourcing the development of their side projects to smaller studios, while their publishing was still intact?
---
 My condolences. I will be there. May she rest in peace.
---
Happy to help!
---
DE and DD are both pretty good choices for someone's first DPS class. They're both worth learning, especially if you like thief. It's just a pity that there isn't a good condition option for the class any more!
---
There are *some* ranged strategies in raids, but the fact that boons are so closely tied to player proximity means that the ability to attack from range is pretty much meaningless 95% of the time in any game mode where boons are as critical as they are in raids.
---
Wildstar wasn't earning money to be kept alive - Guild Wars 2 is earning money.
---
City of Heroes/Villains were sacrificed to fund development of Guild Wars franchise.
---
The community of GW/GW2 has no position to complain about ncsoft because these games exist only because of ncsoft and their money.
---
Who is boasting about not spending money? Nothing that op said mentions boasting about not spending money. In fact, you’re kind of agreeing with him.
---
But from what he said, and your reaction about having a temper tantrum like a toddler is so out there it makes you look like you’re really angry and upset here.
---
I think about maybe the greatsword as an arcane weapon. Arcane spells are about crit-damage, so the attacks could focus arround that. That would synergize with some traits. Maybe they could give some boons to yourself and allies. Fair, because the greatsword is the elite skill, so it should stay powerfull. Maybe mix in a blink attack.
---
I can and I have. It's not that it's bad, far from it. But 400 wasn't sustainable
---
So far i enjoy jumping around with my staff tbh, even tho my super potato pc doesnt allow me to see ground effects very clearly so sometimes i jump INTO and OUT OF stuff...
---
If i get stressed much about those jumps i'll give dagger DE a try :p
---
Thank you.
---
KP were asked by speedrun groups, bc you there were expected to solo content (teams splitted up).
---
The issue is NOT specific class roles. See above. It takes 1 second to switch this in GW1. Someone in your group will post you the correct build, you click "copy" and that's it. Same as no one in GW2 complains about being forced to run banners as a warrior instead of signets.
---
Was the same in 2005-2012. As example in FoW people were searching for nuke eles and passiv prot monk. No "beserk only". No need to know rotations or anything. Stick with your team, know how to play your class: both stuff which you have learned while doing story. Are you "raid ready" after finishing story in GW2? No.
---
Jessica Price will always try to push her agenda but she wouldn't have a reason to lie about that. Josh Foreman also said that Anet wasn't really focusing on GW2, so I think that gives her statements more merit.
---
I've also heard some pretty concerning rumors (that I won't be getting into because I cannot provide a legitimate source) about what Anet has been up to and it makes their statements all the more depressing.
---
They are a business not a charity. We are their customers, it is up to them to give us a reason to spend money
---
Maybe every Feb 25th, so Players can gather and tag up.
---
No, only the life tree, but people were talking about the development of GW2 ingame.
---
You can bitch all you want but as long as there is nothing of interest on the gemstore there is no reason to spend money on the game, you gotta be some special kind of stupid if you think we're gonna buy gems just to make some dumbass notion of support. If they want my money then they should bring out products that interest me and not junk that's easy to churn out.
---
It's not my problem, so I won't talk by anyone.
---
people can spend their money however they want.
---
Ahhh okay, you had me confused for a second haha
---
You are setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
GW2 is not dying, Anet's policy on secrecy isn't going to change because of the layoffs.
---
Yeah when I say "You" I mean Anet not you in particular.
---
&gt; But still calling it unprofessional when you do not know the company and its culture is childish.
---
I'm not sure why are you making culture an excuse to everything, a corporation's culture matters to their employees/people who work there it really matters little to the consumer, what matters most to the consumer are the results and how you achieve those results.
---
&gt; Silence? They talked about this... so not sure what you mean.
---
No, they gave us a forum PR paragraph saying everything was going to be okay **before** firing promenent GW developers.
---
&gt; I also like how you assume that I have weekends to meet friends
---
That's your own personal problem, the normality is that people have weekends off, if you do not it's on you.
---
&gt; and how you assume teams do not need a reorganization after people could volunteer to leave.
---
They do, and will this be done during the 2 days office closure?
---
&gt; The last part, of "Anet is a corporation first" made me laugh a lot, thanks xD Again, lack of knowing how things work at the company.
---
Exactly, and this is the problem right here, Anet seems to not think that way, and that's why some of us are worried.
---
fuck, they hava a pronounce? what an extremist
---
Too bad,i can't vote your comment multiple times. After so many vets from Anet, who pretty much left, these parts of the game are in the air w/o gravity. But their 4h content each 3 months wont go very far, from now on. 
---
May she rest in peace.
---
There are no HoT mounts, no. Mounts are a PoF thing; HoT has gliders (gliders are still pretty awesome, though, and they really change how you move around in the jungle). 
---
You probably did. I was there today at the home instance around reset time to let guildies in to farm my home instance for the daily.
---
Normalizing for inflation would make the later numbers look worse.
---
If they have sub this reddit will implode 😂
---
I'm sorry but any time Anet discloses future plans the community take it as promises 6 wings a year Anet hoped for this when it didn't happen the community acted like they broke a promise. Heart of Thorns was a feature expansion players acted like Anet said it was a content expansion. Season 4 to 5 the community took that as Anet has given up on GW2. Until this community can start acting like fucking adults and take what is said or written as it is then the secrecy will continue. I know I am going to be down voted and abused for this but I'm really not here to join the mob when there is no needed for them. Also you can't tell people when to and not to spend money.
---
Why don't you let people decide for themselves?
---
Can find world boss trains daily tbh.
---
Yes, exactly. My original point was that the game was making more than enough money to sustain itself, the problem was that ArenaNet grew to a ridiculous size. 400 people is pure insanity, The Witcher 3 was made by 200 people with CDPR growing to 550 for Cyberpunk 2077. 300 is still a fair bit, though I assume that also includes administrative jobs like IT, HR etc.
---
Yeah and the problem with the gem store: you can use ingame money which is nothing worth after 6 years with endless farming events
---
I didn't expect this to be honest haha.
---
I’m with you. I just want acknowledgement there is a future beyond LW
---
You must be a special kind of stupid to think I'm telling people to buy shit they don't need. I merely stated that supporting the game now makes more sense than running around telling people you're actively intentionally NOT gonna buy anything just cause some people got fired cause that's such a sound logic. Hey these people have cost problems let's stop buying anything sure that will make shit better.
---
Yep like /kalamari\_\_ said do in another character.
---
There is only one time I agree with the community uproar that was in 2013 and the rest of the year blog post where pre cursor crafting was promised to be coming in 2013. Its a horrible policy to have but until the community realises the difference between an iron clad promise and a hope then the secrecy will continue and I'm with Anet 100%.
---
&gt; Lol a fanatic, nice assumption
---
It's not an assumption. It's the logical conclusion from reading your posts.  
---
You try to "rally" people behind some inane cause and then act like a spoiled child in the comments section. 
---
I mean the game is still there, if you like the game and it is your money you can do whatever you want, i dont think hold the purchase in gems are gonna change something, and to be fair is there so much hoarding twards gold those days that i think only new players actually spend their money in gems...
---
Ze German language
---
Lw3? Living world 3? Those don't give any gifts for anything. For gen2 legendaries you either need HoT map comp or PoF. Recommended is HoT since other pof materials are timegated. 
---
And as someone already said, another char.
---
If you think Anet would shutdown GW2 development when it's their only source of income, you're fucking delusional.
---
Cool, nobody cares. Do your own thing, just don't ask people to do what you want for your own personal crusade.
---
getting downvoted already. so no surprises. ;)
---
To add to what Vincent replied, There are a non dps ranged roles, like all sort of kiters on different bosses. But that is not where you wanna start learning. In shot is is meant for ranged classes as well, but not ranged game-play in most of the dps cases.
---
Possible, sure. But it would probably be a disaster. 
---
Don’t forget since anet took over their own marketing and publishing we got a series of stupid marketing campaigns such as aaarrrrrrrrgh and tea. They put a lot of effort into specifically not targeting gamers with their marketing.  
---
Again. Why in the everliving fuck would they put gw2 into maintenance mode if it's their only focus and only way to make money right now? Even NCsoft can see that cutting off the only income is bad.
---
I spoke around the anniversary that I think expansions are great for the game because it means that they earn money and I showed that I was worried about how gw2 would function without expansions. But I think this is a reason to really put out an xpac.
---
It's not all doom and gloom yet.
---
About NCSoft: I won't argue here, but i don't think it's "as easy as A, B, C" and you could be wrong. 
---
About relationship: I've personally never had this kind of relationship when i played a game. Games create emotions when i play. Bad or good ones. Because of the story or the design. So, for me it's more than just buying. The relation you describe i got it with the hardware manufacturers. Nintendo, Sega, Asus, Acer etc... to give random examples. I'm only a buyer for the machines, but over all a player before being a customer for the games.
---
That said, it's up to you to not join. ;-)
---
Maybe because it belong to PoF, after the introduction of mount , disabling mount in these area sounds awkward, besides, it has tons of hidden area and achievement that can be done only with mount. 
---
And the LS4 story are so good with new mechanics as well
---
I'll continue to buy gems, even though I'd prefer to see a roadmap.  The thing is, this is still the cheapest form of entertainment per hour that I own. Buying gems to support a game I spent more than 20,000 hours on is a no brainer to me. Even if I only play another 50 or 100 hours. 
---
Lemme get some of them laurels... I'll take them in the form of heavy crafting bags.
---
On one hand you're talking about the product and on the other you're talking about the studio's cost problems. Only the product matters. That said, an MMO is a long-term service and interruptions or future prospects of the service definitely add or decrease value of the service. In any case, the studio's cost problems are not your responsibility, and it is not your responsibility to keep buying to support them. It is their responsibility to refocus on what consumers want and to bring them back.
---
If none of the possible combinations work, you even need to go as far and go to another forg entirely. I had the LA one bug out on me when crafting Twilight. I had to use the forge on the Royal Terrace in DR instead.
---
I get your point and I definitely would love to hear that something is in works. Especially expansion. I don't think it's too much to ask Anet, after they deal with their internal issues, to say what's coming after LW5. Is it going to be expansion or are they going to continue with LW model only. Silence in that matter is in my opinion the worst thing they can do now as they need to rebuilt public trust.
---
So much this!
---
I am not sure of the laws but I thought that in Australia if you make someone's job redundant they're allowed to take redundancy (because their job doesn't exist) instead of redeployment (applying for a new job).
---
NCSoft was like, we tried to be the good guys with Wild Star, now we need to turn the screws on GW2!
---
It's usually worthwhile. 
---
Look at the people who work their appearance wise and then check their twitter history
---
If you arent a far-leftist and/or part of the "Orange man bad" cult you dont get a job at Arenanet 
---
What scares me is they actually canned most of the apolitical devs and kept all the extremist loons 
---
Funny how a missing UI indicator is a bad thing for MMO's, but highly praised for games like Dark Souls and 99% of indie roguelikes. Either we are talking about 2 different parts of the gaming community (what we don't) or most people are just used to the hand-holding MMO genre in general. Some people seem to not even be able to walk in a straight line, if there is not a tool-tip for that.
---
Check out the GvG Discord and look at guild recruitment and see what matches what you are after. You can even chat to some guild leaders if you like.
---
The link can be found here: https://discord.gg/99NtbAD
---
Alternatively check out Roy’s stream around 7-11 GMT. He streams GvGs and even his own Guilds scrims. 
---
I won’t link his stream as I’m not sure if it’s allowed but you can find it easily by typing Roy GW2 twitch in google. 
---
Promises are only one aspect of the problem. The other being some issues lasting for months, years, and still untouched. Not desires (like build templates are), but real issues : bugs, balance, ...
---
Maybe we can compare our 50/50 HOM?
---
Oh, right, that's a thing! I'm at the point where gold or any shiny is almost meaningless to me, so I don't even bother :( 
---
yeah smth like gw2 armory would be cool but i doubt we will get it anytime soon
---
Good on you (yay?) 
---
But beside that, I really dont see the point of your post...people will decide for themselves...and there are already plenty of posts like this. 
---
Hi All
---
Looking to buy both expansions (and ill probably get the living seasons at some point too)
---
On dlgamer i have a price here of $36 
---
[https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911)
---
Which says 'can be activated in UK.'
---
But the sterling price here is about ten dollars more expensive
---
[https://www.dlgamer.com/en/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-43923](https://www.dlgamer.com/en/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-43923)
---
Is there anything i am missing? or any potential issues with buying it from the dollars link?
---
Im currently using the downloaded FTP version, but decided as ive already had a lot of fun i want to support the game.
---
Thanks
---
i get that Point and you're not wrong there
---
but at which Point did the Person leave you only have a reference to the last Post of the Person  
---
maybe just took one Month off cause of irl Stuff, had time playing again, logged in and found the new Season
---
Maybe the Person does have several Thousand off hours maybe the Person only has 20 you can't tell!!!
---
&gt; If anything Anet needs our support now and tbh I doubt a lot of you haven't spend money on a bunch of early access games with no future in your steam accounts..
---
*raises hand*
---
I haven't.
---
&gt; This information has been all over glassdoor for years, as well as some past-devs talking (however vaguely) about the ills of the management in ArenaNet. They have a lot of super talented employees who end up having to take the blame for how management pushed them into shit directions without listening to the people who actually understand what gamers care about.
---
And one more person going on about things "everyone knows". Should be really easy to provide sources then, shouldn't it. At least it would be if you weren't just talking out your ass.
---
So much easier to just shout "evil corporations and evil management ruined gaming" then actually informing yourself, isn't it?
---
CEO is a higher skill compared to all the people who got layed off, I cannot commend on NC soft CEO, EA and Activision CEOs are proven dumb. The position still requires great array of skills and thus that position will always get a higher pay no matter what.
---
It is like surgeon, gets a payment as same as a warehouse worker then there won't be any surgeons and if the warehouse worker needs surgery they will be screwed.
---
Everyone cannot be CEO only few exceptional people can command and live in that position and if there is no CEO then these workers won't be getting an sustainable salary for long.
---
You are just talking out of emotion, human society works on the basis of risk, reward and is interdependent. Greater salary is the reward for taking risks and facing challenges to attain that position.
---
Humans are reward driven, the same reason now you are angry about as you played GW 2 for reward and now your rewards are gonna die and soon you will have to find something new and rewarding.
---
I'm kinda in the same boat tbh. I stopped playing then came back to HoT. Then PoF. I played again about 2 months ago for a while and have logged in a few times then immediately logged back out tbh.
---
I want to like PoE but I'm not keen on the aesthetic or the combat. Otherwise it reminds me a lot more of Guild Wars 1 and GW2 does tbh. 
---
He said on stream the other day that he's never quit a job; sadly, it's kind of an industry wide issue, not exclusive to Anet whatsoever. :(
---
How does playing GW1 apply to time spent in GW2? More importantly, maybe we should compare our time spent in-game over the last 10 months? :)
---
Given the difference in quality between PoF and season 3/4, I'd never prefer a LS season over an expansion. It's just not worth my time.
---
There is the possibility of creating a jp that has mounts in mind, or even is specifically designed for mounts i think! 
---
Sure, but why should I take someone's sermon seriously when they aren't a very active player who knows how the game's current state is?
---
&gt;10.Spoilers  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;All story content has 30 day period when it must be marked as spoiler.
---
So why sacrifice quality for quantity? Can't you have fun with the actual gameplay itself? As a WvW player i never get this, i play the same map in the game Smite for years now and it's still my favourite game.
---
I believe that they do realize that... however, if the corporation is publicly traded, their literal "job" is to make a profit for the investors. Literally milk the cow until the last drop, doesn't matter if it survives or not. :/ 
---
I agree fully that it would be nice to know where we are headed. But yeah people need to cut them some slack. Demanding things right now is harsh. These are humans who literally had no idea they would be fired. I have absolute disdain that kotaku broke the story before they even knew about it, really showing the give no shits about other people as long as it gives them clicks.
---
I hope the best for the Devs, still working or not and I have faith that this will give a renewed focus on gw2 overall.
---
I don't think we have more to add friend. So I wish you a good day. :)
---
A lot of the Jackal Portals feel like Jumping puzzles, so I agree 
---
Sorry for the loss folks.
---
I don't know how common the name Melora is, but did this Mel also play World of Warcraft for a stint back a few years ago?
---
So you going to judge me by my flair not by what my posts contain? This actually says more about you than me.
---
Well my opinion is that if naive redditors want to be influenced by "doom prophets" instead of using their own brain then let them. Why care about stupid people, they are just a fraction of all players.
---
I wish you good day aswell and enjoy your time in Tyria :)
---
I don't like Dry Top, I never know what's going on and navigating is annoying. Silverwastes may well be the best map in the game, though, mechanically speaking. Although Dragon's Stand is also nice, but I haven't been able to run that one quite as often as Silverwastes. In fact, I'm still doing Silverwastes slowly getting to that Luminescent Armor.
---
In FFXIV you can honestly get good enough gear with minimal effort, and the gear treadmill adds reasons to do certain content. Having no gear progression is a double-edged sword for sure.
---
Same goes for the spec and stat mechanics, while having variety can be good, classes end up feeling all over the place and optimal rotations can end up being trash to play or make no sense, after all the skills aren't made so much the whole class in mind.
---
Yea I agree this post is pointless, but not because of OPs lack of playtime in GW2 over x amount of time.
---
There's no risks of the game closing and/or going into maintenance mode in the near future.  
---
GW2 is the only income for Anet at the moment, not to mention is still one of the most profitable franchise Ncsoft have at the moment (it earnt more than Aion and Lineage 2 in the last months for example), and they already stated they will continue updating the game at least until Season 5 finale, so it's safe to assume AT least for a year and an half from now.
---
The worst consequence we may expect from the recent layoff, is maybe a longer wainting between updates, but even that is debateable; the only sad thing about the lyoff, is that Anet lost some valuable employees, and most of them will be missed by the community.  
---
Is it known if GM nickname is bound to specific single employee?
---
No, gw2 community is doing cringy panic show and pretend worst possible scenarios are going to happen without any hints for that. Just play and enjoy.
---
I thought his lack of playtime was important to highlight -- I really don't understand how you can come back, and in 20 days be like 'hey no gems pls'.
---
It smells of stirring drama to me. So I decided to link that, because people deserved to know where OP is coming from.
---
Raids can be made tougher on release, and get slightly easier as people progress their gear.
---
You can ask the same question for anything in MMOs, "why isn't this unlocked for me right away". It's the sense of progression.
---
I literally mentioned glassdoor, your lazy ass could go type "Arenanet glassdoor" into google and look it up for yourself. With your attitude I strongly doubt you'd read any link anybody puts the effort to fish out for you. 
---
Same amount of manpower for PvP and WvW as for PvE
---
It reminds me of a friend in game, who had lung cancer. I helped her in the game whereever I could. I were leading raid squads so she can get the rewards and doesn't have to worry to be kicked. Invited her in fractal groups with friends and so on.. But at some point she didn't come online anymore. I can feel your pain. 
---
May your friend be kept in great memory.
---
Mod team has been working after hours to keep the shit out. Give them a break.
---
If you enjoy it go for it but I think we're well past the games best days and there is the very real prospect of no new real content updates outside of 2 hour living story pieces every few months. 
---
So if you're looking for a time killer sure but if you're looking for a longer term investment I'd look elsewhere. 
---
I'm in US so I can't help you, but I recomend you look for a guild, check the recruitment official subforum, there are plenty of guilds that I'm sure will be glad to help you. 
---
You not gonna tell me how the fuck i spend my money, pls remove this shit 
---
You know the irony is Anet original said they'll never ever implement mounts cause waypoint travel is more than enough. But they did because the community wanted them. But we don't remember what we're been given, just what we haven't..
---
I feel like rule 3 (*Post to stir up drama*) and rule 5 (*Post low-effort/-value posts*) could (should?) be applied to a lot of these posts recently.
---
I mean posts like [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/avcblj/hold_on_gem_purchase_until_a_roadmap_is_released/) are as low effort as it gets. Also maybe adding a "discussion on the recent layoffs" sticky thread could help alleviate some of the dumb shit that's being posted right now
---
I have 1200 fractal relics and 15000 pristine fractal relics. I want to get the infinite potions, but it will take forever. Should I convert my pristine relics to normal ones, or will I regret it later? Later I want to make the omnipotion, ad inf and then the fractal buffs (in that order). Would it be a bad idea to just spend most of my pristines?
---
&gt; I faithfully believe that this mount must be exclusive to PvE
---
Boss: Ok guys. We designed this mount that can break gates and dash behind enemy lines. Any idea where this could be usefull?
---
Jonathan from accounting: What about open world?
---
Boss: YES!!!
---
I wouldn't call them liars, that's a Strong Word and ArenaNet has given me a lot of fond memories during the years. I also feel sorry for the laid-off devs I hope they find their way. But then again... AreaNet is famous for not sticking to their plans or delaying them big time. A lot of times they tried to save face while protecting a badly-implemented content piece. That I wouldn't call lying but sometihng like not giving clear picture.
---
Also, stop behaving as if a small minority of reddit users would make ArenaNet shape their business policy. The majority of players in this game give no krap about detailed road maps, raid mechanics, balance, etc, they just want shinies, nice maps and that's that. So ArenaNet don't ignore communication because a portion of the community is toxic or Quick to judge. They just don't know themselves about their methods and ways. Their whole work is a so-called pathfinding process. Evidents for these are the hop on hop off attitudes towards living story, no back to expansions, no back to living story, etc etc. If every gaming company shaped their communicative strategies according to their game's toxic  side of community then no communcation would ever happen. A studio big like ArenaNet has to understand that they can't live under rocks and cherish their own little ideas and constantly saying it's ready when it's ready. 
---
JUST BLOW THE D!@# GATE CANACH!!!
---
that number is so missleading,that its not even funny. kinda like youtubers with 60m subs and  2 k views on vids.
---
This GM is always helpful. Any time I ask for a senior GM hes on the case and explains to me exactly why or why not they can honor my request. Great to keep him around.
---
Feels to me like someone who has just returned to the game is the MOST IMPORTANT PERSON ANet should be concerned about with gem store purchases, personally - something called them back to the game after a long absence, so if I were in charge of the biz side of things I’d be intensely concerned with figuring out ways to re-monetize their renewed interest. 
---
But hey, maybe that’s just me - I AM a recently-returned player myself (came back in Nov. after several years away, too). 
---
Just save up 10 mails and send them to me. Ez.
---
This news article references a single cohort study that showed some correlation between VTE and arterial cardiovascular incidents afterwards. This study and other similar studies did not demonstrate any direct causation or provide significantly strong results for it to be reflected in any professional guidelines or literature regarding stroke. You can check the CDC, WHO, any stroke association around the world. Physiologic risk factors for stroke are almost universally agreed upon to be: blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, various heart conditions, prior history of stroke, and maybe sickle cell. 
---
It says that activation is worldwide so I dont see the reason to take the more expensive one.
---
Nice move! They deserve our regards too, in the middle of this storm. The only one i've been in touch with signed his/her email with this bear  **ʕ·͡ᴥ·ʔ**  ... That's so cute \^\^ 
---
Ok thanks for the info buddy
---
Thank you for your response - I will have a look there also :-) 
---
Ah yikes, it seems my "joke" was too weak :/
---
no not really, it's 2 hours of content every couple months that you do once and never revisit because there is no reason to
---
Considering the time spent working on these side projects and the ammount of resources put on them the "**far less cost**" quote is debatable.
---
I don't believe I have met her, but my condolences.  Death sucks man, but let's play GW2 in her honor. :)
---
&gt;  I wouldn't be so quick to assert he's blameless here. 
---
Nor do I, but that is because I can't prove he's done everything right. However, I also can't prove the opposite - as well as anybody here, I think. I've seen quite a few posts in the recent time blaming MO for the layoffs, but the truth is: nobody of us knows enough of Anet's management to judge them. 
---
All we know is that developers - we don't know even how many - were diverted to some - we don't know which or how many - other projects than GW2. Which is imo completely fine as - like many others have already mentioned - Anet's future must not be dependant on GW2 alone. Sooner or later they have to develop new games/things to strengthen their position. From a buisness point of view that was a good intention. We can argue that there was little content for GW2 - although one has to admit that the quality of this content increased a lot. Whether this was caused by not enough devs working on GW2 or other things, we can't tell. We also have no idea how much progress was made in those unanounced projects and wheter or not they were promising.
---
What I'm trying to say is: we know next to nothing, still people try to evaluate this whole situation and what may have caused it. And this is why I sincerely hope, we will get at least some information after the dust has settled. Because the information about what's going on is incredibly important right now. 
---
it's a pretty boring joke tbh.
---
Yup, ChmSteki is right, [source](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/39962/eu-gw2-client-with-us-version-of-expansion).
---
Ls3Ep2 JP can fuck off, though.
---
Yes you can, Kaineng is in the NA mega sever. 
---
But who will entertain me at work if not reddit ? And it's not like people didn't get nasty complaining about being told off is quite hypocritical but nothing new. There's almost nothing in the thread that isn't painfully predictable.
---
But I am also an asshole :3
---
Ok, thanks
---
I am not sure they had one before to be honest...
---
Let's just hope that Arena Net is 100% focused on GW2 now. Maybe we get things now, that were not possible before. I don't think dungeons will get their revival, but maybe Fractals and Raids will release more frequently. It would also be nice to see a second set of legendary armor for PoF raids. Technically, LW5 will still be PoF content. (Would be interesting to know how this is handled tbh.)
---
There is more than enough potential what Arena Net could do with GW2. Scrap the "maps are frozen in time" idea and release current event chains to restore Kessex for example. More frequent balance updates. New PvP modes. New Guild activities. Whatever... They just need to grab this opportunity now and dedicate all of their development resources to it.
---
Haha, well in my headcanon I like to think she is setting an example to the younger generation of Tyrians.
---
Ofc coz of bad politics , l2 and aion died for west market. And full fault was at that time too on ncsoft.
---
I do it each day for extra 5 petrified woods. Even though there are couple of places where I can't jump properly, I finish the whole JP in 15 minutes.
---
But the very first run was super long and painful for me xd i can't imagine how it was for pioneers
---
P.S. Searing Ascent in DM can fuck off tho
---
&gt; such thing does not mix with WvW
---
Says who? You know nothing about the Warclaw's abilities or how the Warclaw functions, and yet you've formulated a firm opinion rooted in complete ignorance.
---
Google his customer service regarding direct song. People are still waiting for his sound tracks since launch. 
---
I don’t expect a roadmap right away, but I do expect a quick statement from Anet saying something about more content in the future after LS5. Don’t need specifics or dates just reassure us there will be more from the refocused team. I personally won’t spend another dime on their game until I see some kind of statement. Putting something out from MO in the next week or so would go a long way in helping ease the community that is on edge right now. 
---
While i fully agree we should not be in dark, and i hate ncsoft (historical hate based on different games they managed to ruin on west) i also just went and got 2k gems coz even if i dont get anything new i still have a lot content that is worth of it. 
---
I really love the scenic conversations. A lot of people like the current system more, but everything feels so distant and impersonal, with the core story the focus is automatically on the characters talking.
---
The gear treadmill is not what appeals about FFXIV or WoW. GW2 fanboys keep saying this, but hardly anyone subbed to WoW or FFXIV do it for the egar treadmill (besides, to call FFXIV a gear treadmill is laughable as that game virtually feeds you the gear regardless of whether you do hardcore raids or not; you just get it slower if you don't do hardcore raids).
---
What appeals about WoW and FFXIV is the wealth of instanced content. Tins more complex encounters being constantly added.
---
What do I look forward to in GW2? Only the cool story instances and their achievements, because otherwise it's just one more open world zerg farm that bores me to tears and requires no real gameplay other than sitting on a ranged weapon pressing 1 with the zerg and getting loot in 5-6 minutes after the target dummy that is the "boss" is dead.
---
It's as simple as the fact that two games provide engaging updates with challenging content and the other game just provides pretty scenery with braindead gameplay.
---
It's choice box.
---
They also tend to have lower employee turnover, at least in my country, so people are usually hired to replace retirees.
---
Bad "politics" would be if they continued burning money on those background projects without revenue. GW2 brings them money currently.
---
We dont know it depends on what u wanna buy.
---
The best way to know is probably to get something between 2-4K gems and connect every day not to play but just to see what the shop got in it 
---
You know that the guy who made those amazing JPs is gone from the company right? :(
---
Maybe, not for gw2 though. It feels we're already past that point. If they ever decide on gw3 then it could be viable. 
---
Oh jesus christ
---
The point wasn't that you need to grind all of that out, though. The point was that it's a completely optional thing to pursue as you play whatever part of the game you enjoy most.
---
Some people really just enjoy gold farming activities. Like, genuine enjoyment from things like istan or riba. Some people absolutely hate it. Some people tolerate it as a means to an end. Wherever you fall on the spectrum, you're the one who gets to decide what you want to do in a game where all paths are optional. 
---
If you enjoy pve endgame, you'll make a decent chunk of gold each week just from doing t4s and even more if you do CMs + raids. If you enjoy pvp, you'll make decent money from spvp. If you enjoy wvw... Okay this one will probably make the least money but is still fun so I do it :V
---
No matter how you slice it, MMORPGs rely on giving players long term goals to keep them playing. I just prefer how in GW2 that grind is one for vanity rather than power. It helps them keep the game centered around the dynamic and reactionary gameplay mechanics as opposed to a bunch of gear checks.
---
And what are the reasons to do certain content? That's just sucking me in, more and more. That, I do not like. So, I'll still play GW2. And try to get more people to play GW2. I'll leave the "hardcore" games to the hardcore gamers.
---
&gt; in EB the main objective is to capture and hold Stonemist Castle.
---
No, it's not.
---
Your first link is downvoted to hell so it will never appear on the frontpage, so it doesn't really have to me removed.
---
[Copper-Fed Salvage-o-Matic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Copper-Fed_Salvage-o-Matic) is the best quality-of-life improvement available. Nothing else is even close.
---
&gt; I can’t login from Monday to Thursday because of work and I hope I don’t miss out on items on sale.
---
You're guaranteed to miss items. Most sales are for a few days at most.
---
Do we know this for sure? That vets left willingly.... Within a week of a meeting saying cuts were happening, with secure severance packages and the ease of finding new jobs. Id like to believe this but this is not world we live in, not most of us anyway.
---
Yeah, I like the idea of it too. I remember playing some mobas in the past that had truly invisible characters. It was a nightmare to play vs them, however it was a dream come true when I found one and wrecked em! But yeah, camo I would be happy with.
---
Ill probably buy 800-1600 gems later in march during sales when they add something i like
---
no
---
You don't hold it because of the points. Noone cares about that.
---
You want it only because it gives you most fights.
---
Thank you so much for making this list and keeping it updated. Sad to see all the names, I hope they find new work.
---
heeeey .... you guys all sound like robots. You wouldn't be robots, right???
---
gendarran fields, applenook hamlet waypoint, head a little north and she'll be left of the road. really weird-looking ._.
---
I didn't have the opportunity to meet this person, and I'm profoundly saddened by that fact. Though I can't attend due to work restraints, I'll be sending you all my deepest condolences and well wishes. 
---
I won't let you down, I promise ; v ;
---
Unless you sort by new which I always do with relatively small subs
---
Thank you. &lt;3
---
I actually wish they were a bit more generous with the weird models. :P The human innkeep from the PS has a strange model as well. 
---
Now Searing Ascent...THAT one I can agree with, but the challenge is still good enough for me to want to keep doing it.
---
Vabbi is the server to go to, if all the guilds haven't burned out.
---
&gt; It is no ***so*** secret 
---
Fixed.
---
That was the joke part. For the serious part, are you saying you'd agree to wait long time after the SAB to get this new mount &amp; the new episode at the same time ? Because adding it if it was not intended could be long to develop... 
---
I personnaly trust the devs and i'm sure this mount will not break the WvW. Maybe a bit at the beginning, who knows ? But at least, it will be fixed. And everything will be just fine like for the glider. ;-)
---
OR ... i am that naive and i should stop to eat unicorns corns in my cornflakes every morning. I don't know.
---
Reddit is a huge place, people from all over the site flock to a subreddit if a controvesy is going on.
---
Many just put comments here to add to the fire and many of the most dumb comments are from people who very rarely post in the GW2 subreddit.
---
Provocateurs is all they are and sometimes people get baited in their emotional web.

There's this saying, "Never argue with an idiot. They will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience."  - And I can say, from experience, this is all too true, because I'm usually the idiot who tries to engage with them out of curiosity to change their mind. It usually never ends well.
---
You need a pretty strong willed community to fight against them and I'm happy to see this hasn't completely blown over.
---
As for spending money, here's a concept, I don't see it as "investment" or supporting the game, that's a by-product and worst case, the thinking process of the main character from Nightcrawler.
---
I buy gems if I want something - it's not often I *really* want something but why should I torture myself over it because some think it's time (again) to not spend any money on GW2?
---
If it were for me, GW2 would have always been a sub-only game with a method to get a month of sub-fee with gold.
---
For now I think it's way too late to change that but I'm a big believer that GW2 would be more healthy without relying on the volatile spending habits of players and constantly finding new products for them when the product is right in front of them, namely GW2. 
---
It's also more uncomplicated and open when talking about spending habits then. Why should we shit on a player who drops 100$ every month? He supports the costs of at least 8 people for a month alone. I've seen this all too often now that, depending on the situation, big spenders are either hailed or ridiculed which is just not fair, but it's fitting in its irony, because the system is not fair anyway.
---
Running and maintaining games on the budget of a few is something I think will (and should) die out, just because the stress and uncertainty should not be put on the developer or the community.
---
There is a locked dwarven tomb in shiverpeaks with an event chain. Forgot if its in dredgehaunt or lornars.
---
If one is playing in EB and the objective is not to take SMC upgrade it to t3 and bring tons of invaders to have good fights... Then would be better to just go to BLs
---
I love GM Viper too. I hope he sees this thread!
---
I had no idea March sales were a thing. Has it always been like this? I wonder how the hysteria around the layoff will effect the sales numbers.
---
You should watch the language, OP might ground you.
---
That's a different issue. The point is, he is acting like he regularly buys gems, and is giving his opinion from that perspective without being clear where he stands. That's wildly inaccurate and like I've said, smells of drama stirring.
---
Seriously? Glass door is what you consider a reliable source of information for internal workings and decisions in a company? 
---
And even if we are dumb enough to take glassdoor reviews at face value, nobody has written anything about any actual decisions or projects on there. So no, you haven't provide anything that would support your claims. Still just talking out your ass.

i heard project RoS is recruiting fighters, rather go there

I would be happy to kick ass beside you anytime. &lt;3 I'm so sorry that things have worked out the way they do, but I really appreciate you and everything you've done for the game, along with your kind words of long ago. &lt;3

Well apparently executives wander around the always muttering "Everything is going to fine", so yes, maybe they should come to reddit to look for advice.
---
But some ppl like those "sadistic" content
---
Isn't this just a race and get the in right portal thingy, without even jumping
---
Nothing will change, it never does. They created a masterpiece product called Guild Wars (1) and it made them a ton of money. They’ve existed off the back of that product created all those years ago and the fruits of that success have been depleted.
---
Prince Rurik is to be looked down on and smirked at. I bet if there was a GW3 project the story would have made us puke.
---
It might work in other games sadly it wouldn't work in Guild Wars 2 due to the nature of our combat
---
True. But it would've been their intention to continue developing them so your previous comment that it 'wouldnt have happened anyway' isn't true. If development was better organised then dungeons would indeed have happened. 
---
I recommend to run minstrel chrono for chrono players who are new to tanking. Take as much survivability as you need, be it 1005 or 2300 toughness. A dead chronomancer is useless, and especially on bosses who deal high damage (desmina, qadim, vg to some degree) there is no shame in playing minstrel when you are still learning.
---
However, with the introduction of diviners gear as well as changes to soi you can go very aggressively with chrono builds which results in high damage. Do not underestimate the dmg a chrono can do, you can easily reach 14k on mo on a regular support chrono in 60% bd gear, which can be further improved by taking disenchanter, danger time and/or more berserker pieces. 
---
Now, if your idea is to play with 1 healer only keep in mind that 1 druid is usually enough to keep the entire party healthy as well as keeping up 25 might. Try solohealer on easy bosses like mo, samarog, gorseval and ca. If you struggle to be topped off on those bosses with a solohealer then your dps classes need to pick up the pace. If your dps classes get oneshot by the statues explosion on mo it is their fault and they should be punished for it. A minstel chrono or a 2nd healer won't help you there (besides scourge barrier).
---
You can certainly play with a minstrel chrono as a "second" healer but you should really push towards full solohealer compositions if you want to improve your kill times. Also, most (if not all) bosses are easier with more dps. I constantly see people running 2 healers on cairn, sometimes even 3 because they think a 3rd healer will make the boss easier. It won't. More dps will. They are dying because they fail mechanics not because of ambient/unavoidable damage. And guess what, playing with more healers will make this even worse by further reducing your squad dps. The only people who take damage are the players who take the agony (which should be chronos and the druid who can distort/heal the damage) and perhaps everyone if you choose to skip greens but then the druid knows when they need to pop their burst healing.
---
Its actually quite funny that you bring up DE. They are currently(again) in hot water for their chat mod abuse which DE has been unwilling to fix for years. So I guess every developer has their weak link and aNet is not exception.
---
Well more than one of them have said they chose to leave. 
---
Huge companies go bust all the one because of stupid decisions. It’s not unusual. The people at these companies create their own little bubble they exist in and things go wrong. It literally  happens every day.
---
Oh, sweet summer child...

Glad you're still around! 
---
Not really, consider the amount of time they spent creating GW2.

Enemy keeps coming attacking your shit and gives you fights and loot. That's exactly what you want. (At least as long as you're not one of the ac-sitters)
---
Speaking of spending money, how can I tell what mount skins are available? I see the contract and it says to click on it to view skins but nothing happens. Do I need to buy it first? 
---
No need to be condescending towards those who don't share an opinion. Feedback between client and company is always important and Anet has given us little from that. I don't know how to run a company, sure, but as of my research and experience, Anet hasn't been doing a good job and it's evident from a clientside perspective.
---
I might be wrong but I'm not pretending to be better than anyone here.
---
Important note regarding ESO: they actually DO have a subscription, but it's a hybrid model. The sub grants you access to ALL the DLC's (their version of Living World), Dungeons, and Trials, along with other goodies (a set amount of their equivalent of Gems each month, their version of the Crafting Bank, etc). Without a sub, you either have to pay for each release individually, wait for them to go on sale in bundles (this is what I did for their first three DLC's; I've ignored Dungeons as I just kinda don't care about them), or hope that they give it out for free (Murkmire was given out as a daily login reward a while back; note that ESO's Daily Logins are NOT cumulative like most other games; you had to log in 20 days in a row in November or you missed out on the free Murkmire.)
---
No, I'm talking about [this one](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Drydock_Scratch).
---
Down-voting because you copied this text from someone else's post on the GW2 forum.
---
TBH loot shouldn't be a main focus at all in WvW. &gt;\_&gt;
---
That's nice. Thanks for sharing. I was really dying to know how you are feeling.
---
&gt; I think you know far less about the situation than your experience with a &lt;20-employee company in a completely different field seems to make you think you do.
---
Describes most people commenting on this sub for the last week. The tiny glimmer of information we've been given about the internal workings of ArenaNet has spawned hundred of overly confident posters declaring they know perfectly what went wrong and who is at fault and why everything is terrible.
---
In reality we've got a bunch of people who read the wikipedia summaries of three episodes of Lost and then giving out their hot take on what's going on.
---
The only expertise of any value people on this sub offer is on how they personally feel about their game experience. Wanna talk about why you want build templates? Perfect, that's the kind of feedback that is useful. Wanna mention which character in the story you want to see more/less of? Go ahead! Keep in mind you might hate Taimi but someone else might like her, they aren't keeping her around to spite you just like the warclaw might not be what you want but someone else might want it. Wanna tell us all about how MO is a bad manager based off of eight tweets from a fired employee and your cork board of pin tacks and loose string explaining how the scraps of information sources from forum posts, twitter feeds, news stories, other people's speculation - much of which is dated information now and never included the full context of what was going on at the time anyway - why waste everyone's time?
---
At some point it'd be nice of people could just accept that, unless you are are in a position to know in detail what was going on at ArenaNet for the last few years (aka mid level to senior employee), we simply don't have enough information (and never will) to make informed judgements of the internal workings of ArenaNet.
---
Y'all aren't being constructive or insightful, your just circle jerking each other's eagers with rage boners for how unhappy you are with ArenaNet, but looking stupid in the process. Why would anyone listen to someone who makes such sweeping judgements of the internal workings of a company when they clearly don't have access to the necessary information to make an informed judgement? The only thing that tells me about the OP is they have terrible critical thinking skills, at least in this situation.
---
Friend of mine was banned bc they said he attempted a charge back even though he sent his bank statement that showed no chargeback.  Took them three weeks to work through it.  and still they banned him.
---
A roadmap, if it is released at all, would be months off. It makes no sense to wait.
---
Bottom line is, this is ANets only money maker, they aren't going to abandon it. While I'm not under any delusions that GW2 is going to be their sole focus, I think NCSoft has made their point that branching off to crazy levels is not the way to go. 
---
Short term, you're only going to get PR speak. They are on information lockdown, all devs (current, and former) are under NDA, and no one is going to let anything slip IMHO.
---
Long term, ANet has been burned with intended plans and such. While they may be working on fifty different large GW2 related projects, there's no guarantee that they will be released at all, nevermind soon. Sometimes things just get scrapped for varying reasons.
---
Pair that with the normal community backlash, and you've got a perfect storm.
---
Does anyone here uses a VPN?

The only time I used mounts on that puzzle was to collect all the golden badges. Otherwise, I just use gliding because griffon and springer kinda took the fun out of it (though flying through the cavern is pretty fun).
---
I played ESO in beta and everyone complained at how clunky the combat was and how poor the animations looked.  Others defended it and said that would all be fixed, it is just a beta and we'd pay for subscriptions which would get us what we wanted faster than if the game were only B2P.  As I understand, nothing has changed with regards to animations and combat feel.  I say this because a big driver in PvP enjoyment is combat feel.  That's why more people want focus on class balances over, say, the structure of WvW.  So when you ask who does pvp better, just looking at maps is missing the gorilla in the room.
---
The rest of the skrit holes are isolated and easy, the ones I remember are:
---
"Its a secret hole, under the secret bridge"
---
And
---
"Its the one closest to the edge."
---
The design goal of WvW and thus EB is to score more points than the enemy. If individual players choose not to PPT and instead focus on picking flowers, that doesn't change the design goal of the game mode or the map.
---
Holding SMC isn't the only way to score the most points on EB but it's likely going to be the easiest.
---
It's a good idea. Then they could give all classes some kind of passive skill that would allow them to permanently see all stealthers at max distance. Then we would have a type of stealth that would actually suit a PvP game.
---
if there is something I want il still buy the gems tbh. even if something does ghho horribly wrong, I guess i try to live for the now.
---
I love this game and its my hobby, so don't mind getting my purse out at all - no different to buying a new group of fish for my tank or a new designer pefume :)
---
Yeah I worded that badly. What I meant was that the loot you get is objectively worse than PvE. If you're there solely for loot, your going to have a bad time and worst case hurt your servers chances.
---
May she find that next great adventure.  I'm grateful to the DTOP guild to complete my legendary collection in Dry Top.  The events and completions was like clock work. The ease of the getting to the top tier map. It's wonderful to see the outpouring and warmth to a dedicated and selfless person. I wish I had known her . I feel like I do through the beautiful words written in remembrance. Thanks again for sharing this.  
---
Amazing Masterpiece indeed! Let's jump from happines! Ohh wait, you can do that only in That Masterpiece Legacy, called GW2!
---
I'm Swedish and I had my German friend log in last year to buy a bunch of things since I was gone from my pc for 2 weeks.
---
It's no guarantee sure, but OP would probably be fine.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gem_Store/Anniversary_Sales
---
Look at that link daily and see if anything cool pops up. Even better is to look through past years sales and get enough gems for items in case they do appear if you're buying with gold, because the price ratio goes up during the sale.
---
Anet should be a lot more conservative with its ideas and policies at least imo. MMOs were at their best when they didn't try to cater to all demographics. If gw2 wants to be casual, then god damn be casual. Not saing remove raids, saying remove anything KP or make it unlinkable. And from this point just let the dead/dying game modes die off, just focus on PvE and fractals (no raids)
---
&gt;If Anet would come out and say something to the effect of "The remaining 300 employees on staff are fully committed to supporting Guild Wars 2 going forward. After the next living story is complete, we'll be ready to discuss our plans for the next expansion that leads us into the next storyline for Tyria."
---
I think that they are planning some kind of roadmap, infographic, blog post, video, or whatever. It would think it quite weird if they keep silent after news like this. We have to remember that Guild Wars is, as far as we're aware, ArenaNet's only source of income. It's in their best interest to assure the playerbase and the general public that the game isn't going downhill.
---
At the same time, though, this will take time. There will be a recovery period where the employees are reassigned, the company structure is redone, and the immediate and distant future is all planned out. I'm not expecting any kind of substantial "future of the game" post until at least the Warclaw patch is released.
---
A bit ago, winning servers did gained some +% towards the PvE (for example if you won skirmish, your chance to additional gathering strike raised by 1%, or your magic find , etc), but this was removed. Hopefully, with alliances, we will get something that would reward winning.
---
I don't know if GM Sir Reginal (╭ರᴥ•́), Senior GM Heart and GM Tha Creature are still part of the support team, if they are let them know there were very helpful for me and they are my favorite GM's (including Ultra Viper), please. Thank u for everything!
---
all the transparecy anyone should ever need: they money you put into gw2 wasnt going into gw2 development
---
agree social club part, 100%. Disagree on the "how to operate the vehicle", the massive ideology flex should have been purged by ncsoft a long time ago, no matter the casualties
---
Well, for the moment it doesn't look too good, but remember that after the crisis of console gaming, there came a golden age of PC games, which is likely the reason many of us were drawn to this hobby. Also, I'm fairly sure Anet will be able to weather this storm.
---
I doubt it will be that difficult. Some of those people are names you know in the industry. And being laid off != being fired. They probably got money too, so they survive a couple of months of finding something new.
---
Why do so many people not buy sentry ward and dust
---
I havnt really come accross your guild or Melora, but I want to say I am really sorry for your loss and I hope your memorial is eveything you hope it to be for both you and her :)
---
Is voicing a desire for more transparency, communication, and perceived openness to criticism really that crazy for a player to ask for? I feel like that's critical, valid feedback for a dev and playerbase dynamic.
---
You're spot on, of course.
---
However...
---
&gt;	In reality we’ve got a bunch of people who read the wikipedia summaries of three episodes of Lost and then giving out their hot take on what’s going on.
---
...from what I've heard about *Lost*, it made little enough sense most of the way through that I'm not sure reading 3 episode summaries would be a huge disadvantage vs watching every one.
---
I wish we got a GW1 sequel along with GW2  expansions: that way those that want a traditional MMO could stick with GW2 and those of us that preferred GW1 could get new stuff to do in a game that was more to our liking.
---
With GW2 all there is, it's going to be much more difficult to cater to both camps with just one game.
---
Chances to find a thick skin nowadays are smaller than to drop Zap from a skale.
---
oooh, OK. I just remember someone making a Reddit thread about that character a while back.
---
People be like "Ananet working on few other projects and don't enough update to gw2"
---
Ananet finally working only on gw2 
---
People be like "what a bad news, its not good for a compagny to work only on one game"
---
I prefer Arenanet to work only for gw2 and do what they know than Arenanet working on other projects not updating enough gw2.
---
The layoffs are a sad news, OK. but honestly i think its good news for the game because we will have more to play and more focus on the game
---
\&gt;  We dont have dedicated buffers or even some kind of boon-trinity system  where certain boons get always buffed by lets say healer builds or  utility builds. 
---
Wait what????  
---
Warrior Banners  
---
Druid 25 Might + Fury + Spirits  
---
Chrono Alacrity + Quickness + addditional  
---
\&gt;  At the same time, however, all boons are extremely powerful 
---
Boons are supossed to be powerful otherwise you wouldn't need them
---
\&gt;  **Solution:** 
---
i don't even wann start with whats all wrong with this
---
I see you are trying to put some gasoline on the fire.
---
Why tho? What do you hope to achieve with this?
---
I don't know why everyone's shitting on you OP. You didn't say you were gonna *Save the company with these 3 simple tricks!* You said they need to be more communicative, transparent, and open to criticism. I don't have any personal opinions on #3, but I think you're right. They have some bad PR going around, and more communication and transparency will help the game get through these scary times. Those are valid things to give feedback on as a member of the playerbase. You're not trying to pierce the corporate veil, the community has felt for a long time that there hasn't been much communication on what we ask for vs what we get. They don't have to do what we ask, but your playerbase feeling like you won't tell them what's going on is a bad thing, period.
---
I'll be happy to look at these, thank you so much. I hear a lot of negatives each day, so hearing something nice really does make my day. &lt;3
---
The conveyed information is about the same tbh.
---
You only need to complete the 4 maps in HoT not LWS3. Also, once you completed the map you cannot repeat it with the same character as any progress is unlocked forever, you need a fresh new character.
---
Verdant Brink
---
Auric Basin
---
Tangled Depths
---
Dragon's Stand
---
Takes about 1-2 hours to complete each of the zones, assuming you can find help from another person for some champion Hero Points, also some meta events block progress so there's that too.
---
It has shown signs of stagnation for the current crop of mobile giants like Zynga. I wouldn't be surprised if the mobile hype ends up taking a lot of developers by surprise. German browser/mobile developers InnoGames and GoodGame aren't looking too good either at the moment, so I'd be wary about investing into low quality mobile giants. There is growth potential for decent and good games, but skinner box simulators may have reached peak performance.
---
The thing is, ArenaNet has always been horrible at long term planning. Just see everything that has happened with GW2: first they said they wouldn't release expansions and tried temporary content with the Living World season 1, then decided to change to permanent new content with the Living World season 2, then decided they would make expansions anyway, and so on. They have always followed a huge iterative design that can lead to great products, but that often is messy as hell; I still believe the cancelled other projects suffered because of that.
---
It's very likely that ArenaNet has absolutely NO IDEA of what they will do now. Sure, continue season 4 and then make season 5, but other than that? They probably are nowhere close to figuring that out.
---
It's not that simple. Even at 1%, then a zoneblob would have a door down in seconds with the help of a single additional ram. Its fast enough with just players. 1% is \~4000 hp of a T0 door. Now, you could say "well if it's high enough cd a player will have done more damage in the same time" and that's true, but even 80 people cant stack that kind of damage at once. The door will melt, but not go \*poof\*.  
---
I can only imagine it working on some sort of shared global cooldown on the target, ie if you have 50 people doing the pull on a door at the same time it still only counts as 1 attack, so you have rotate pulls properly.   
---
But I also suspect that this will be one of those things that Anet "forgot" actually happens in WvW so they didnt take into account the amount of players that can stack the same attack.
---
Phamy, I have an updated tweet, referencing this post, as well as a 2nd tag up time for NA folks.  Thank you again for all your help!! &lt;3   https://twitter.com/BluJasmine/status/1100799086301712386 
---
Let them get on track first.  
---
Then they can spread out but for fucks sake: dont go balls deep into other IPs like they did that time completely neglecting their main game.  
---
So, regarding your statement: Thought was good, execution of thought was bad.
---
&gt; Maybe have a stealth mechanic like in some MOBA's where you are a faint blur but can be in stealth all the time?
---
Planetside had that on their infiltrator class back in 2003. It worked out marvelously because:   
---
1. It was an FPS game, so 100% of your abilities (also known as, shooting your gun) were non-target. Easy to tag that shimmering silhouette with.   
---
2. They had extremely limited inventory and could only carry pistols, so a vastly reduced combat potential compared to other infantry with real weapons   
---
3. They had their own types of gameplay in stealth infiltration and hacking bases, hijacking vehicles, placing combat engineering deployables like mines or motion sensors behind enemy lines, and other things not available to non-infiltrator builds.   
---
GW2 clearly misses on every point, so there is no good reason to have a class with permanent stealth in this game at all, especially if they are not ready to balance it for pvp/wvw with heavy damage, utility, and mobility nerfs to offset that advantage.  
---
Sounds good. I hope you don't go back on your word.
---
Yeah, it's amazing, almost as if there were more than one person on the internet :/
---
What is this? I don't know what it is, so that may be why I have not bought any. Just searched the wiki for it, but no results. You foolin me?
---
&gt;For fuck's sake.
---
We'll agree to disagree. You're getting a bit worked up. 
---
&gt; Scrap the "maps are frozen in time" idea
---
As someone who came here after Living World 1 was done and over, and can never replay those things, 
---
#NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.
---
Well, it doesn't really update things, or am I reading this wrong?
---
 &gt; As the proverbial dust settles in the next few days we're going to re-evaluate our schedules to make sure that our releases are realistic and allow us the time to make sure they hit our internal quality bar. This means that some updates are going to see delays, like the recent Warclaw, as we regain our focus.
---
Fair. It seems they may be working on a roadmap. This is excellent news and exactly the communication we like and respect to see. Thank you Mike Z.
---
Please delete, someone posted already and I didn't see! 
---
"We’re welcoming back some familiar faces to the Guild Wars 2 team that had been working on unannounced projects."
---
- good news. This looks like what we assumed but it's still good to hear for sure.
---
well sounds like there wasn't anything planned after S5. Wonder if that changed now..
---
I think this is all very good, but I think the community needs to police itself on some things. It's felt like a large segment of the community has come to developer discussions with bad intentions. The world doesn't need more provocateurs. On the flip side. a large segment of the community also comes in with zero desire to engage the developers on interesting topics. There's more to life than your favorite quaggan. My perfect world would be one where ANet devs come in and give honest answers to questions that aren't written like death threats.
---
&gt;  kind of mentality even from a dev on reddit (not sure if former dev or still working).
---
I know exactly which post you mean, because I saw the "developer response" next to a thread and wondered what it could be. And behold: It was a dev making fun of a player and throwing some shade. A+++
---
Anet just communicated :)
---
[https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/69872/update-from-the-guild-wars-2-team?fbclid=IwAR1vSh1DPpNabR40CYNOVvyUxoBFJn2T9WiVyJMzpCLLRZfcRf6jQo6bgVs#latest](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/69872/update-from-the-guild-wars-2-team?fbclid=IwAR1vSh1DPpNabR40CYNOVvyUxoBFJn2T9WiVyJMzpCLLRZfcRf6jQo6bgVs#latest)
---
This is the sort of thing that will help the game recover. Hope they keep up with this from now on.
---
This *is* the right time of year for this, frankly. The first quarter has historically been fairly slow for GW2, so delay tolerance is likely to be high.
---
Based on this, I'd say things look "not too bad" which is an upgrade from "dire" of the past week or so.
---
Sincere condolences.  Has this been the shittiest GW2 week ever, or what?  FUCK.
---
Glad to hear this. I am expecting more from now on though...
---
It says they will be communicating more and getting back into developing shortly, and it seems to imply a roadmap once things have settled out. This is the type of communication the community has needed. It's a good update, and they've basically stated that they will get back to us soon with more information.
---
&gt; With so many people talking and shouting about the need for a roadmap, why not group together and form a road map that we, the playerbase (a very vocal one in this reddit at least) wish to see. 
---
Because we are *only* a playerbase and like it or not many people bang their own drum about their personal lists of wants and nots.
---
Because we, as a playerbase, are not in any position to talk about what a company should and shouldn't do in regards to their content, vision, creative freedom etc etc. 
---
Because we as a playerbase also have no information on what is actually going on behind the scenes other than speculate and speculate based on speculations even further. Leading to make up stuff out of thin air and assumptions, without any realistic expectations and pragmatic knowledge.
---
Because we as a playerbase think everything is too easy to do because we only get to see a finished product but often the majority of the people have no idea what goes into a project before seeing the light of day.
---
Because a roadmap is not so easily done. Any bulletpoint you have put in that list requires a bunch of design/marketing/developing/narrative decisions behind it that is just impossible to do as 'a playerbase'. 
---
and many many reasons...
---
ArenaNet wasn't born yesterday, they have systems and teams in place. Yes I agree they should be more open and listen to feedback and communicate but your post isn't the kind of constructive criticism ArenaNet needs and its not even help, its more of a recipe for disaster.
---
There's many things one could nitpick and discuss about your post but I won't get into them. Its nice to offer suggestions but they are by no means a 'roadmap', they are just suggestions which I'm sure they have also considered as a company but because of one reason or another they haven't decided to implement them.
---
A for effort though, and sorry if it came off harsh. 
---
You'll love this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__01XI6SjY
---
&gt;Go back to the living world with regular updates .
---
Yea, they could do that but only for the ongoing season. They want to sell their product so why would they go back to core maps? Besides, this already exists in the form of current events.
---
They could make more epic event chains or meta events like they did in ls1 but they decided to abandon that idea.
---
&gt;We need more dungeons .
---
What about fractals? And to some extent raids?
---
&gt;More raid for those who love raiding
---
I'm pretty sure every raider would love this.
---
&gt;Fun map with replayability like Heart of thorns map . 
---
Yea, that's one of the biggest flaws of pof maps. There are metas there but some of them aren't on a fixed timer and they usually do not include long meta event chains like in vb, ab or td. I would definitely love something like that in the desert maps.
---
&gt;Consolidation of currencies .
---
No. If this was the case then people would only play the most profitable maps where you can earn currency as fast as possible. If i want kourna currency, i have to go to kourna and not farm sw.
---
&gt;Stop breaking builds .
---
Everything you said in that paragraph would overcomplicate things. Leave them as they are, and if balance is needed because an elite spec breaks are core mechanic then that should be taken care of in the elite spec traitline.
---
&gt;Bosses who look like bosses and with mechanic to boot
---
So, raids?
---
&gt;The item produced when players are levelling crafting should form a core of what is needed for legendary crafting
---
Please no. I don't want to have to hoard 60 non-disposable items in my bank just to craft a legendary. They already made lesser tier materials needed for crafting legendaries with mystic curios, amalgamated gemstones, mystic tribute and gen1 (and hot legendaries) collections.
---
Are people forgetting from 2005 to 2015-16 lets say when the new projects started Anet was only focusing on one game. I like this if the studio was bigger like the size of Blizzard I'd get it but its not so I wish the layoffs didn't have to happen but renewed focus on GW2 only can build Anet up again.
---
Still, it's not clear if there's an expansion in development for after season 5.
---
You are correct. I guess the post is aimed at people calling **OMG THE GAME IS DEAD WTF**, but it's easy to evaluate that GW2 - with 300 developers still working in the company - isn't going anywhere. At least we know there's some more WvW events to come, yey.
---
Well, it doesn't take a genius to read between the lines that this marks the beginning of the end... Oh well, so be it.
---
I don't understand where people get this. If the PoF leaks hadn't happened, we wouldn't have known what/if anything was coming after LWS3. They talk about what is coming immediately next. Today's Pokemon announcement didn't spell out that they're planning X games after the next game, did it? No, they announced the next game. Doesn't mean there isn't "anything planned after Gen 8".
---
Where did you see that Crystal Reid was laid off?
---
What I would like to see, based on having looked into it a lot;
---
* Living World releases every 4 months like clockwork, which come with more composed and comprehensive balance patches, world polish, and a single key instance feature. Give it to us all in one go.
---
* Alternate instance features; Fractal, Dungeon, Raid. That's one of each, every 8 months, which if they each have a team (even overlapping teams) doesn't seem too bad.
---
* Tell is clearly whether we should expect expansions, or if not, begin including things like Elite specs on a per-LW basis to keep growing the game.
---
* Release Alliances in early summer, and roll Edge of the Mists into WvW as the fifth map with some new special features.
---
That would readily get us through the next two or three years.
---
I'm so happy he mentioned WvW after certain layoffs
---
Were they actually working on gw2 lately, or were they working on the side projects?
---
+1, definitely agree. Sometimes bad things give way to good. This might be such a case. We can hope. Many thanks for the transparency and thoughtful communication
---
Fishing 😀
---
But I agree with you about 'Agony'. Utter nonsense. 
---
I'd add better menus. I want a tab in hero showing what masteries I don't have and how to get them.
---
The fractals menu should be accessible from anywhere, not just Lion's Arch.
---

---
&gt; throwing some shade
---
&gt; A+++
---
I mean, not a lot of credibility coming from a guy throwing comments like this without any argument whatsoever. And from all that I wrote, that's what got suck in your head? 
---
Man with people like you no wonder they never change...
---
Possibly. I read it as them telling us to expect the next Living World release to be delayed. As it should. You don't lose 25% of your workforce and keep chugging along at the same rate. I would honestly expect/be fine with them reducing the number of releases per year at this point.
---
i just hope they wont delay everything too much 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/autnqg/list_of_laid_off_devs_lets_keep_this_updated/
---
How so?
---
This literally tells us nothing...
---
Plus, I like the idea of "random" expansions. I'm personally very impatient so I dislike having to wait for announced content for a year or two. Dulls the experience a bit when it actually comes out for me since the hype kinda dies down after a while of waiting. But each to their own I guess.
---
I really doubt this. Just because we never heard about it doesn't mean things weren't planned. Knowing season 5 will be next (months beforehand) was actually more advanced information than we are accustomed to.
---
I don't see anything that confirms roadmap though. It is rather for them only than for us as well sadly.
---
A tab added to Hero showing Masteries not collected and information as to how to get them, rather rhan burying this info.
---
I'm of two minds of it. Obviously, I love a focus on GW2 since it's currently one of the few games I invest my time into. BUT I also know that, realistically, a studio should be working on their next title as well as their current one. I want them to be working on a GW3 or a new IP to make them a more solid company. No one's expecting Blizzard to die because they have about fifty IPs they can leverage. ANet only has one, which is always a weak point. I hope the restructuring still lets them at least try and continue on the most promising projects.
---
As far as I am aware Crystal Reid moved from working on raids to working on many projects as a director. 
---
Whatever I'm not even going to bother....
---
If you hold this statement to higher standards of analysis of corporate speech, things aren't looking good.
---
It's important to note that, while it may imply that a roadmap is being created or worked on, there's not an indication that the roadmap will ever go public. 
---
We at least have confirmation that the game won't be abandoned (it was a safe assumption, but it's hard to stay level-headed in these situations). Players may want to temper expectations in regards to increased transparency until it actually starts happening with regularity.
---
Yep - I hope so. Perhaps it is the wakeup call they needed. I hate how costly it was - I can't think of a company I'd prefer those people to be at let alone the human cost, but perhaps we'll see more focus on GW2 and better transparency now that they have no choice.
---
This is nice, but it doesn't answer the only important question I have: Will there be another expansion? If so, when?
---
People A and people B were different groups of people.
---
1. I don't think we need a new map every episode, maybe a new map that is utilized for 2 episodes (not even back-to-back releases). This alone would increase visible population on the new maps and perhaps more frequent chapter releases.
---
2. Meta for every new zone. This is what will keep players returning months after release if they find them fun/rewarding enough.
---
3. Open world bonuses. I'd like to see daily/weekly randomized Metas granting greater rewards. Example: Complete the following events today and receive a new chest with better drop rates and unique currencies: Claw of Jormag, Defend Tarir, Death-Branded Shatterer, and 5 or so others.
---
4. Dungeons and raids merged with 1-10 player difficulty scaling. This allows all players to experience new content, even on their own. The range of rewards obviously being greater with 10 players to encourage grouping.
---
5. A bi-monthly balance patch (even smaller tweaks) plus 3 new specializations released. We're told to expect expansion quality releases going forward.
---
I don't feel that's enough. Especially with a 300 person team. We now know that a large fraction of Anet was working on other projects. This clearly affected the release cadence and quality of the living story episodes. Now, presumably all hands are on deck with Guild Wars 2.
---
An expansion is really what they should be working on. They don't even need to tell us what it entails. Just... content releases will continue while we work on the next expansion.  
---
I mean, realistically to design a whole expansion and even LS's you need to plan 2 years if not 2.5 in advance regarding the story. Its a bit kiiiiiiiiinnddd of early but not really that early to start discussing about expansion or anything after LS5. If anything, I would expect them to start discussing of prospects after LS5 right around THIS time actually - I'm sure they have ideas but nothing is concrete. I'd expect them to make stuff more concrete during summer. No panic needed
---
long term im expecting the opposite, i think with the renewed GW2 focus the teams can probably crank em out faster. delays at first as they restructure after the heavy hit they took.
---
i think the scope of living world is whats gonna be hit. think they'll be less ambitious with what LW delivers.
---
That is not entirely correct though. Molten Furnace, Molten Boss, Aetherblade, Mai Trin, and Nightmare. All of those are LW1 content repurposed for Fractals.  
---
Frankly if they incorporate the Siege on Lion's Arch and a Scarlet boss fractal, the latter with a CM, that would be at least a \*start\*.
---
TL:DR: "I don't play the game, but I have Opinions!"
---
It literally shows the exact opposite of willingness to change... The way he writes it makes it seems he will indeed move some resources back to the main game BUT will still keep trying other projects.
---
r/HailCorporate is that way.
---
It does, it's just not what you're wanting to hear.
---
You hear that? That's the sound of a thousand pitchforks dropping in peace. 
---
I think I'm using Grape Shade for the metallic channel on my Charr to match his armor to the Inquest Mk II pistols. Don't recall what energy color I'm using, though (and I'm at work, or I'd check).
---
I would say that's likely. They don't seem to like having episodes overlap with festivals, so they may delay it after SAB.
---
This still seems kind of shallow but on the other hand they truly probably don’t know where they are headed at this point.  I wish he’d give us some sort of teaser for season 5, just to generate a little excitement. 
---
Do you mean when you hit 80 or when you complete PVE?
---
I usually play according to my mood.  If I am feeling like I need a goal and want to actually have a thing to complete I go achievement hunting.  If I am feeling social I might head to a low level area and do support for some newer people.  Sometimes I just hang out in a capital and make gear for that lvl 60, going to Claw Island push and offer it in chat.  
---
But often I just go someplace, join an event and drift around just being part of the world there.  The new boss timer thingie has been great for that go for Taida, stay for dealing with the Inquest.  With so many places and such varied landscape it is easy to forget all the nooks and cranies I can explore.  But I am squarely in the Explorer wedge of the [Bartle taxonomy of player types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types) so exploring is the biggest draw for any game.
---
If you figure out what your type is it might help with figuring out what will be most appealing to you.
---
I was thinking the same thing. All they did was confirm things they've already confirmed in the past. With no mention of anything beyond LS5 I would not expect the game to continue. 
---
**Bartle taxonomy of player types**
---
The Bartle taxonomy of player types is a classification of video game players (gamers) based on a 1996 paper by Richard Bartle according to their preferred actions within the game. The classification originally described players of multiplayer online games (including MUDs and MMORPGs), though now it also refers to players of single-player video games.
---
The taxonomy is based on a character theory. This character theory consists of four characters: Achievers, Explorers, Socializers, and Killers.

^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
---
Agreed - hopefully they can keep a lean team working on the future while having the bulk of employees working on the cash cow (GW2). And maybe give us some fucking armor sets in the gem store once again.
---
  We got too much uncertainty in the past. Moving forward we need more certainty/strict release schedule... Also Mike Z didn't say single word about fotms/raids...
---
Ben Arnold left voluntarily, Jason Reynolds is not confirmed to have left and Crystal Reid is confirmed to be staying. 
---
Of the remaining two, Cameron Rich worked on a wide range of stuff so and it seems like his most recent work was with the living story (team 2). I don't know too much about what Paul Ella was working on.
---
"I played the game for 6 years and quit because of the obvious neglect, but I have opinions" is really more like it. Just saying...
---
You mean showing not completed achievements as not completed instead of not showing them at all?
---
Did you read the "familiar faces" part...?
---
Oh awesome!  Thanks Bot!
---
Nothing about raids in here
---
actually im not against ambition, but ambition takes more time.
---
think thats been the problem with season 4, why the maps were feeling sorta pretty but empty.
---
kourna suffered cause an ambitious mount.
---
jahai was a great map and story chapter but, suns refuge was waaay too ambitious for a thing to be used once. the idea of a central hub would make more sense for the beginning of a season or expansion, seeing said hub evlolve as the story progresses.
---
and the newest map suffered because the extremely epic instances this time around, especially the kralk fight. besides 2 metas without many build up events and the catacombs theres not much to do.
---
i think instead of what we seen where every episode is doing something ambitious, they'll save it to once every few episodes so they have more time.
---
I didn't say they died what a stupid thing to say. My point is they put a lot of hard work into something and were laid off before they could be see it launch. 
---
I wonder if this is how Gw 1 players felt when Gw 2 was announced, personally i'd like them to keep focusing on Gw 2, personally i don't feel ready for Gw 3. 
---
There absolutely were/are people thinking exactly that. 
---
He also didn't say anything about new gem store chair skins. 
---
Except for they mentioned "expansion 2" was in the works shortly after HoT came out, so yes we knew it was coming far before the leaks
---
MMOs just aren’t the big thing right now. Games are cyclical. I’m sure MMOs will eventually come back into fashion, but there are a lot more options for social multiplayer gaming than there ever was when I was a teenager. Back then it was Dark Age of Camelot and.... EQ and UO. Sure there were side scrolling multiplayer games (Jazz Jackrabbit 2 mostly), but really not much. 
---
WoW came out and changed the entire landscape.
---
Tons of social games followed. LoL, Runescape, Minecraft, and everything in between. Guild Wars 1 was WoW devs IIRC. 
---
There were suddenly a bunch more options. I didn’t get into games until 2008 but my first project was a particular STAR WARS MMO. Server load, server costs, and net code are all considerations with MMOs and just like any tech, most of that became cheaper and easier. 
---
Games used to be hard to make. Now anyone can download Unity or Unreal — both extremely powerful engines — and build your own game at home. Accessibility has gone way up and tech costs have come down. 
---
With more options on the market, and MMOs being incredibly expensive to develop (said STAR WARS game I worked on came in at 300 million dollars and has since been the last large MMO that EA has touched), you just don’t see MMOs being made anymore. They need huge worlds and a great investment in not only the character development 1-XX, but a ton of end game content at release. It’s frankly much easier to make something like a Battle Royale, which is essentially like DAoC RvR/GW2 WvW in a smaller Battleground form without all of the required gear grinding and progression. Quick matches and dopamine rushes for the player, less work for a developer. 
---
MMOs are labors of love with a ton of game systems (World stories, side stories, deep crafting systems, deep PvP systems, deep gear systems, etc). They’re like meta games inside of meta games, as you are creating an entire functional, interact-able world. Most games only need to focus on a few game systems that feed the central goal. MMOs are meant to be playgrounds. 
---
What is dead may never die.
---
Oh, of course!  
---
Words like these:
---
&gt; I’d like to share with you a little about what’s currently going on at the studio and what it means for the game.   
---
&gt;The next episodes of Living World are already in development, Swiss tournament support is coming to PvP, we’re looking at more WvW events coming soon, and the return of the Super Adventure Festival is imminent. Our long-term plans for the game like World Restructuring and large-scale improvements to quality of life are still in the works.   
---
   
---
in the next few days we're going to re-evaluate our schedules to make sure that our releases are realistic and allow us the time to make sure they hit our internal quality bar. This means that some updates are going to see delays, like the recent Warclaw, as we regain our focus.
---
At first glance it might not seem much, but, in a few words Mike Z both told us some plans and some realities we'll have to face (delays). This kind of communication is definitely a change, for better or for worse.
---
Seems more fitting for the end of this season, no? 
---
Indeed, I am a bit disappointed. I was hoping for more than "rest assured, the game is not dead". That is about the bare minimum.
---
Hard as it may be, with a lot of co-workers having just lost their jobs, I think now is the time they should communicate that GW2 is going to be better than ever. But maybe that's not their plan for the game.
---
acutally there are new player guides for WvW which should be viable as they were recently created for the release of the Warclawmount in WvW

---
Clearly there were cuts from the whole company, but it sounds like 2 unannounced projects were canceled, and as far as we know there were only 2 - and if JP can be believed, a LARGE chunk of the company wasn't even working on GW2. A lot of people (Josh included) who were working on GW2 previously haven't been recently, so the remaining ones coming back may be a net positive.
---
Goodjob anet, this is a step in the right direction.
---
I wish the same could be said for raids. :&lt;
---
How did they wasted GW1 though ? Althought not perfect, it was still an incredible game and had a great success.
---
That's not the purpose of the post. This isn't a 'road map'. 
---
&gt;  I do, however, accept your apology for your attitude
---
LMAO - that's quite the imagination you've got there.
---
Yep.  I wasn't around for the Guild Wars 1 heydays, so maybe things were better back then, but it became abundantly clear very quickly into the life of Guild Wars 2 that their project management was out of whack.  They delivered (IMO) an excellent initial experience, but it became abundantly clear during LS1 that they hadn't really considered how they were going to maintain all the different elements of the game, and had hacked stuff together to get it functional for launch, at the expense of being able to easily expand it post-launch (dungeons and the Personal Story come immediately to mind here). 
---
What annoyed me was that it seemed like GW2 was shifting into maintenance mode (to be cynical about it). Why would you put your only profit gainer into maintenance mode before having other ips?
---
Exactly. People are saying "Weee, they'll be open with us from now on!". Where are they reading that?... 
---
i did mention how they could spread 5-6 episodes, 3-4 fractals, 2-3 raids, 6 annual festivals trough the 12 months of the year, giving us something new to do and look out for every few weeks rather than 3-4 months of silence.
---
Elite specs are a big selling point they have on expansions, i dont think they will give them one by one for free trough out the year or two tho. But  i did mention that they could add a new master that somehow changes our professions in a way.
---
I also mentioned that they need to add alliances they promised, and that they also need to keep an eye for feed back and react on it for a longer time till they get it right rather than throw us alliances and never look back on it.
---
As for Edge of the mists, it was supposed to be a side wvw map where they would test out new features for the "real" battlegrounds, and the players wins on eotm map will drop off additional supply in their own BG.
---
I dont think they will do anything with it anymore, but might work on something new (they did add a new map with HoT, gave us new rewards and the participation system as well as a new mount soon and hopefully the alliances that will hopefully fix some issues wvw has
---
Everyone is worried that the content they play GW2 for is about to be shafted after the promised content here. 
---
Like will raids still be developed after the next wing or is the raid team dead? Fractals and CM's?
---
While there are other wanting updates on wvw other than world restructuring, PvP, expansions, openworld and metas. People play GW2 for very different reasons and while this update says GW2 will continue to be devolped, it doesn't say if the reasons I play GW2 will still be a focus or abandoned.
---
So much love in this thread. &lt;3
---
Right, but why CAN'T they see it launch? They don't lose access to the game and community when they lose their job.
---
I don’t mean a story teaser, just a hint as to what ‘expansion level’ feature we could expect. 
---
&gt;That's a WvW Balancing issue not a Boon Issue itself, as almost everyone is aware off
---
I disagree. 
---
For the rest carry on. 
---
I don't think that boons need to be replaced or nerfed, but I think parts of them do need to be more well communicated.
---
For example, I play a Chrono, and I have no idea what boon sharing means. I see that i can apply Quickness and Alacracity to myself, but how do I extend that to my team? I have one well which gives quickness to allies for a couple of seconds, and then there is timewarp. What else? I know I am missing something, and maybe I am doing it unintentionally, but I'd be so much more helpful to my team if I knew.
---
I've read the cooldowns, I've read the talent traits, I've looked at guides and can't figure it out. Guides say boonshare, but don't explain how. Tooltips don't say anything about sharing, beyond a signet that tells me I can extend the buffs of my teammates that they already posses.
---
So... how do I do it?
---
Another example. My illusions spawn with quickness and fury (through talents), and when they become clones their boons come to me. What's unclear is 1) when the boons transfer, do they keep their original time or the time left upon transferring. I'd assume the latter, but the game doesn't really tell me - 2) how long does it take before the illusion becomes a clone. This is crucial to determining if the boon will even still be active to transfer to me when they change - and 3) When I use the Chrono Phantasm talent that has it spawn a second time, does their boon apply to them on respawn and do those boons apply to me twice?
---
I can make guesses, but the game is pretty poor at actually giving me the information to make informed choices.
---
I give up its like talking to a fucking brick wall. 
---
Oh absolutely. From what I hear GW1 players were pissed they didn't get things like the Utopia updates, etc. But the thing is, you can't always listen to those fans. Because we would never have GW2 in that case. There will always be an end to a ride, and I think it's smarter to have built the next car before that happens.
---
I think there's no problem if they do have a side project for the future. But they had multiple and scrapped them. Once they refocus on GW2 and it bears fruit, I'm pretty sure they will be free to make another project, probably with NCSoft's supervision though
---
Then there's no purpose to the post at all. It's just a more verbose retelling of the PR-speak nonsense they said last week.
---
Until they give us specifics for actual content being added to the game, I am not interested. 
---
All vague and non-committal as usual. We didn't really learn anything other than the fact they aren't shutting down (duh) , and there's going to be delays (duh) .
---
I read this as "one of the most hateful".  Not even joking.  Guess that says a lot about my interactions with him.  Still glad he kept his job.
---
I'm kind of with you on this one. I'm kind of worried that NCsoft forced ArenaNet to abandon their style here.
---
ArenaNet has never been a big money maker. They decisively show this by never making you subscribe to their games. What they have been is extremely innovative. GW1 was great but their creative vision for a MMO eventually conflicted with the core design of GW1. So they felt they had run the games course and disappeared to make GW2. I think this is an important reason to again state that ArenaNet  doesn't do subscriptions! This allows them to put out games and when they feel they've run their course, they can start the next ones without worrying too much about keeping up content on the old ones. You're not paying monthly.
---
I bet these unannounced projects were their next step naturally. They had run the course of what they wanted to accomplish in GW2. Main campaing plus 2 expansions. Just like GW1: Proph, Factions, Nightfall.
---
I just hope that NCsoft hasn't forced ArenaNet to basically abandon the values they started with. If that's the case, GW2 will survive for a while longer but ArenaNet will lose the people who didn't care about the money and loved to create these kinds of breakthrough games. The culture will disappear and you will be left with basically how Apple almost went bankrupt holding onto their "money-makers" instead of focusing on the mackintosh.
---
Yeah I think it's pretty clear from the statements released from ArenaNet and NCSoft, plus indicated by now former employees, that ArenaNet has major internal issues. 
---
yes we do but if they will keep those gaps the same at this state of the game it wont end well for anyone
---
There was that and I forgot to mention how many senior devs have left/been fired. It just doesn't sit well with me how it was handled. 
---
It wasn't an official comment, it was just a casual statement in a dev's tweet.
---
Nothing new.
---
I don't see anything that needs explaining. Isn't this how all grandmothers walk through public?
---
‚We are not done with Guild Wars‘ 
---
Do they mean the gw2 or the entire franchise?🧐
---
Completely pointless statement that uses a lot of words to say nothing. Totally non-committal and lacking any substance, as with all of their press releases.
---
Depends on how much of the balance team remains intact ...
---
Just as a comparison to the original number people expected of "Over 100". This makes it go from 1/4 of the company to 1/3 (Since the company was ~400 large). That's a fair difference...
---
That was originally going to be in game ... although on ranger.
---
Her face... it's like she's Hannibal Lecter's long lost sister...
---
Why should the future be dark?
---
...so companies with major layoffs/restructuring generally die afterwards? Man, Microsoft, Verizon, Blizzard etc are remarkably lively for dead companies.
---
Sometimes this is necessary because somebody fucked up. Basically every AAA studio has gone through major layoffs. I don't think that should be necessary but it seems to be how the games business is managed for now.
---
Yet I have to see one of those people with desired pronounces in their bio to act like normal human beings.
---
Oh, wait - I won't. They are all radicalized far-left ideologues. 
---
What scares me from this message tho, is that they haven't shown that they have learnt something from this disaster and it seems they plan to continue moving forward the same way, which means that, again, and even after this, they're not listening to the clients.
---
It's like crashing against a wall, getting up, backing off, and running against the wall again.
---
&gt;Rest assured that ArenaNet is not done with Guild Wars.
---
You could take that to mean they do have plans for other gw content other than gw2
---
It felt like the only reason S5 was coming was because Mike Z confirmed it months ago. I feel like if he hadn't, there'd be heavy consideration to shift majorly to other projects.
---
S5, to me, felt like a "Ugh, we have to now" kind of thing.
---
My biggest hope is that in the end this all results on a larger focus towards not only quality content but also quality testing. I didn't realize just how spread out they had put their resources into other projects when there was so much feeling shorted in this one. Hopefully this helps them realize they aren't like other companies and need to focus on making their products the best it can possibly be.
---
It's one of those "this is probably good for the company as a whole and almost definitely great for the game" while simultaneously "that sucks fort the 100 employees who lost a job they loved and the rest who have to put the parts together to keep things running".
---
I've got so many characters and memories I could share, but let's stick to four of my favorites...
---
[**Kaelryn Silverleaf**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/550371267686039574/550371351609868308/gw008.jpg) - Sylvari Elementalist, Magister of the Durmand Priory, and my first real RP character. She's been around for a good long while and has been through so many exciting narratives... Some of you out there might even recognize her from before I started working at ArenaNet! I've been an elementalist main since in the beginning, so she's also been through plenty of fun in the other game modes, including [my first ever raid kill](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/550371267686039574/550374629370494996/12316082_10153871475847754_5897202647558996170_n.png) just a year before I got hired here. 
---
[**Flamedancer Falx**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/550371267686039574/550371416839684096/gw020.jpg) - Charr Revenant, Olmakhan, and currently seen sporting his WvW-best (his normal outfit is a lot more tribal, like his brothers and sisters from Sandswept Isle.) I hear that you have to go all out in WvW, though, so he dyed his hair blue and dug out this crazy looking lightning hammer before diving into the Mists.
---
[**Wulfurn Mythweaver**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/550371267686039574/550371456345964564/gw023.jpg) - Grumpy Charr Guardian, Storyteller, Coping Mercenary. He leads a band of misfits and storytellers after losing his former warband in battle, and draws signets and sigils in an enchanted tome to summon spirit weapons and conjure mantras. He's also my main for raiding right now - heal Firebrand for life!
---
[**Infiltrator Czavvi**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/550371267686039574/550371496367751168/gw029.jpg) - Asura Guardian/Thief, Former Inquest Experiement. They were a test subject for an attempt at safely infusing Primordus's magic into a living, un-corrupted being. They managed to escape from the lab where they were being held hostage, but not without a few scars and oddities. For example, they need to keep their special suit of armor charged and prepared with empty vials for containing the corrupted fluids which course through their veins. Unfortunately, they've lost their place in society, as they are often considered a ticking time bomb, no doubt destined to become fully corrupted in the near future.
---
Thanks for all the wonderful memories, GW2 community. Luckily, I'm here to stay a bit longer, so here's to at least a few more years of fun with all of you. 
---
To all the coworkers I've lost who might see this, I send you much love and warm wishes, and know you'll land on your feet and succeed wherever you end up. Life in the office will never be the same without all of you.

They are selling extras [here](https://www.alchemyartgroup.com/products).  But it is best to support these projects when they are starting.  If you follow [GW2Collective](https://twitter.com/GW2Collective) (the same people who made [Tyrian Tarot](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tyrian-tarot#/)) on twitter or other social media they'll let you know before future projects begin.
---
It doesn't really matter what you or i think right now, fact of the matter is that they make maps only to completely abandon them once the next one comes out.
---
This is why I think they should be making LESS maps and focus on them MORE.
---
I just want to say that i dont think ffxiv maps should even be counted, to be fair. Ffxiv is just not made for open world to be enjoyable.
---
Gw2 openworld is usually fun, Wow OW is arguably frequently fun, FFXIV open world is a joke. Classes are so hyperdesigned for raids(aka dps being all dps rotation and almost no cc, movement, selfsustain, etc) and then content outside is just a joke, so you never want to go anywhere unless its for story prog, getting to a raid to unlock it, or gathering. So the zones are pretty much just for gathering and to be hallways for prog.
---
I understand that accounting for “How much is a wow boss worth vs ffxiv vs gw2” is very very hard etc, but with maps it seems pretty clear. Nobody *plays* in ffxiv maps.
---
Lastly, i would like to point out that gw2 does have one leg up: its content is evergreen. Once a raid falls far below your ilvl in wow/ffxiv you never really experience it again, its just a pushover. While in gw2, tier4 fractals are always tough, soloing hard parts of zones is always enjoyable, raids dont become irrelevant and unenjoyably underpowered, etc.
---
I totally agree. If they are smart they drop 1-2 current event patches in between now and E6 but depending on how far E6 is along I would expect a delay.
---
Not at all; my post was just in regards to the current situation. A lot of people get caught up on the existence of a roadmap and the train of thought that having a roadmap means that they'll share it with the community, which is what I was addressing.
---
They also laid out a roadmap for GW:Beyond to link the two games together. Some of that roadmap happened and some didn't (which is how roadmaps work), but it gave the GW1 community an idea of what to expect as they bridged the gap.
---
Transparency and communication is key and I hope they can make this a habit. And good to hear they are getting back on track!
---
I'm aware? No one's saying "WOW ANET LIED!!!!!", just commenting on, dang, that's a higher number than expected lol.
---
I guess this means no BLC update until SAB time :/
---
This is a fair response. Really glad to hear they are focusing on GW2 and I wish all the best to those who had to leave. 
---
I am really scared.
---
I moved to Asia almost 2 years ago and had to say goodbye to this game, now after finally settling down I am buying a laptop so I can return to the game again, but I also remember what happened with City Of Heroes. If Ncsoft kills another favourite game of mine..I just don't know what Ill do. 
---
&gt; I've seen alot of hate pointed at NCSoft and maybe it's justified. Me personally, I would thank NCSoft because they cut the distraction out of the Studio.
---
It depends. NCSoft might have also been the ones who pushed them into starting those projects as well.
---
I know i’m an optimist a lot but I really feel gw2 is going to improve with this added focus. I enjoy this game a lot, been with the series since around ‘05 so it holds a special place to me.
---
It’s going to take time for them to get back up to pace with all this change but i’m looking forward to the new content.
---
I'd like to echo the sentiment - I'm really glad you're still around. As far as I've ever been concerned, you're the gold standard when it comes to providing great customer support. 
---
well, they did release Halloween in cadence with HoT, so there is always the possibility. 
---
Beware! Some people in this comment section are acting like entitled brats!
---
You're still going through the initial stages of grief. It's already over, let this game go.
---
Where can I get or farm mystic binding agent? thanks
---
How many times do you want to do content from 2012?
---
By stopping development on it and moving to GW2. Don't get me wrong, both are great games, but there's no active game with GW1's spirit around.
---
&gt; edit: Quite disappointed that people keep focusing on what they don't have yet and have quickly forgotten how many things Anet has already given us just cause we wanted it.
---
I'm dissapointed people disagree with my opinion. Why doesn't everyone have as much blind faith in anet as I do?!?!?! 
---
Gee I don't know? These layoffs wasn't exactly the first time many of us felt like anet has lost it's touch. It's a permanent feeling if you're into WvW, PvP or raids.
---
Blind support no matter what they do is what got us into this mess. 
---
I know people complain about some of the elite specs not having well-defined roles or being meta, but as a more casual player I absolutely love the system and the lack of Trinity.
---
Not in the least. Relying on the hard trinity is counter-intuitive and lazy honestly. 
---
Oh really? Wonder why they didn't use it for thief.
---
It's crazy the amount of flack those types of events got, but now people would love to have more of them.
---
I'd like a mix myself. 
---
Altough I'm glad for this update, I'm a bit disappointed. The verdict is as I feared: they have already produced bits and parts of Season 5, which is good, but Z apparently admitted that they don't have anything after that so far. I understand that they themselves don't have a clear roadmap as it seems NcSoft influences their cadences but it would have been reassuring to say that ye, we have plans for not just living world seasons. In this way, this update is nothing new, and honestly I don't want this game to stay in its 2018 state when we got 3 new maps worth of 5-6 hours of gameplay each. Don't say to us that everything will go on as before, say to us that we will focus on the game better, we don't know yet in what way it will materialize like if expacks or bundles or single episodes but we will have a better, deeper content scale.
---
This is fair, though they still mention a lot more in terms of specifics than the original post they made regarding the layoffs - knowing that world restructuring, PvP things, and living world are all still being actively worked on (in addition to other quality of life stuff) is a good start, and we should take a moment to appreciate it as such and encourage them to keep up this communication.
---
It's still over 100 (but I know what you mean). 
---
However, does it change anything? We have an exact number, that's it, it changes nothing.
---
Beware! There are people in the comment section that are white knights and they think of Mike Zs statement as second coming of the Christ. And these people are down voting anymore who is sharing his/her genuine concern.
---
Why can't you enjoy it now?
---
It wasn't a bad idea but they never replaced it with anything that was just as worthwhile.
---
"Im ignorant and i shut down people with different opinions"
---
Where did they state no expansion is planned? This is not a road map for future content.
---
Is Lemoncobra still around?  I haven't seen / heard of them since Guild Wars 1.  They always answered my tickets though.
---
Because their office is closed right now.
---
Unfortunately they released info WAY too early.. So the game was dying out in preparation for GW2, and there was no where for people to go. 
---
But yeah, I do recall a lot of mixed reception. I was very skeptical myself, then excited after playing it after release, and finally disappointed after a couple years and wishing it never happened (just my opinion ofc). I truly hope for a GW3 and a different focus. 
---
For me, it was the biggest deterrent of the game on launch, and one of the primary reasons that I've taken extended breaks over the years. I kept going to trinity focused games (i.e. FFXIV/WoW). That said, I love everything else about this game, basically, so I keep returning.
---
No I do not think it was a bad idea. It started out a bit rough where the answer was to just zerker gear everything, but it has balanced out over time.
---
It's great that so many different classes have been seen playing support roles in Fractals. It's great that people in the DPS role can sometimes be supportive as well. I find it amazing that we don't usually have to sit very long waiting for a role to be filled.
---
If you think about it though, the trinity actually DOES exist in GW2. It's just that these roles are not always played separately by 3 players.
---
For example, GW2's version of tanking isn't all about soaking up damage, but rather managing the playing field. So reflects, pulls, portals, .etc. Otherwise, healers are healers and DPS is DPS, but with each able to bring their own versions of extra support as well.
---
So those unannounced titles , You think Guild Wars 3 one of them ?
---
/Wiki &lt;item&gt; and see acquisition methods. 
---
Maybe we'll get all the legendaries we were suppose to get with HOT 4 years ago.
---
NCSOFT is not going to kill Guild Wars 2. It's a too big game with too much history unlike the other games that they shut down.
---
I think it was a bad idea because the trinity is what brings people together. Gw2 is a lonely place unless you’re playing raids, fractals, WvW... why is that? Those game modes require (for the most part) specific roles. 
---
Absolutely, more so just poking fun at the OP.
---
Agreed! Let the artist paint, make the critiques after. 
---
The study definitely did not show that. It was published in 2007 in conjunction with other longitudinal studies. All did not present significant evidence to state VTE is a risk factor for stroke or arterial cv disorders. That by definition means no causation. 
---
Causation does not mean direct mechanical cause. It just means if you had a VTE, your risk of having a subsequent stroke is not elevated if everything else is equal. Correlation here just shows that there is an overlap of risk factors between VTE and CV.
---
Again, your source is a random low quality cohort study. You can read any guideline on stroke and see higher quality evidence showing VTE is not a risk factor.
---
Probably going to get downvoted, but IMO we shouldn't be speculating so much about how X Y Z is done at Anet, or how the management should have been done . That is their concern, not ours. 
---
We, as players, would like to get a roadmap or explanations or anything in regards to the current situation, but it's not really our role to tell Anet how they should be managed.
---
Anyone got the break down of what's being said for those not willing to unblock unwanted adds?
---
Or is it just basically a long winded article that states... 143 got laided off?
---
They are called naive armchair experts.
---
They just had to lay off +100 employees and their office is closed. They need to get their rhythm back together before they have an idea about what the future is. Don't expect any concrete answers in a chaotic time.
---
Wait, what? HOW?! Just found your fix and that worked for me. Can't believe you didn't get more upvotes due to the internet being full of people with said issue. Your approach seems like the better way instead of restarting Windows Explorer every time it happens. Thank you!
---
I too fell victim to the Norn transformation hype, but luckily, the hype for ele overshadowed all.
---
I absolutely LOVE this look- I used to despise the Ascended gear as a whole set but the individual pieces always look wonderful. Using the slippers??
---
I'm actually surprised by the amount of empathy people have here ...
---
after what happened I believe Anet is exactly "Anet expert" itself
---
You can have a Trinity if you want - raids normally have dps, chronotank (in some encounters), and healers. In wvw you have dps, healers/support and more utility based classes (which isn't the same as tank but eh) . I don't think that GW2 has gotten rid of the Trinity per se, but it has gotten rid of the requirement of it (in pve you can have more hybrid roles, on wvw you can do just dps and guards or just pure dps + run. May not be min/max optimal, but it's good enough to be viable)
---
The likeliness of a roadmap in 2 months is slim.
---
You can't make a roadmap without a few specific things:
---
* A clear idea of where the game is headed
---
* A semi accurate idea of how long those ideas will take to complete
---
* A semi accurate estimate of your teams output.
---
The first is seemingly easy, but keep in mind they arent going to release all that info publicly. That would be a horrible move, because if anything changes the community grabs their pitchforks. Not to mention, a lot of stuff is intended to be a big reveal. Meaning you'd get extremely vague, exactly like we have now: "LS episode once every three to six months".
---
The second is less reliable. Anyone in software development will tell you that accurate estimation is harder in many ways than the actual item being worked on. And estimations can be completely blown out of the water by one aspect not being what was originally thought.
---
The third is the difficult part at the moment. When you've had a large team that is interconnected, which no matter how you cut it this team was, and then remove 1/4 of it... You lose a lot of productivity. Communication lines need to be adjusted, sources of information need to be replaced, and knowledge is sometimes just flat out lost and needs to be replaced/rediscovered. This will take a few months on it's own.
---
Uncertinity is a powerful tool to stop/slow a players enjoyment in a game.
---
And as someone who has experienced this in the past.. it's not a nice feeling.
---
It's difficult to change content that has already been in development since before the lay offs, so that's going to continue. The way they restructure their focus and development teams is something we will notice in the further future. It's not something they can talk about at the moment.
---
&gt; I just want to say that i dont think ffxiv maps should even be counted, to be fair.
---
It was included to address common discussion/argument points between the games - quality was never the angle, but your sentiment here is very very common, yes.
---
&gt; gw2 does have one leg up: its content is evergreen
---
So, this one is interesting, because what that actually means is that there's perceptually much more accessibility and choice, but the problem of "I have all this given content can offer" still exists the longer you play the game.
---
The net outcome of that is a given piece of content is more accessible for any given group of newer players throughout the lifetime of the game, but as the player's account matures, the impact will be the same and content will age via play, if not via leapfrogging.
---
&gt; Once a raid falls far below your ilvl in wow/ffxiv you never really experience it again
---
Frankly this was the hardest part to keep out of the initial post, and it's why I'm glad people pushed to get ESO in as another vector; the genesis of the post itself was because people compare wow/ffxiv to gw2 all the time on this sub, and for precisely the reasons you say, that's completely improper just because of the vertical/horizontal divide.
---
I don't think they are ready to announce anything 2 days after lay offs. I'm waiting for proper announcement yet to make my final judgement. However no expac mention within next 6 months is a red flag for me.
---
I wish them all the best as I want to play this game, I really want.
---
"in the works" reads as "on the table" to me
---
Yeah.. Mobile game memes aside, I was hyped for their mobile game for the better part of 3 years 😫. 
---
I bought some adoption licenses for the first time yesterday as a bit of support for Anet.
---
I only got beetle skins, and I don't have a beetle yet, but oh well. It was just birthday money anyway. Good luck to everyone at Anet, leaving or staying!
---
I want to believe but COH was pretty big (Not gw2 big) and went from p2p to f2p. It was doing really good, large player base, new content that was really good and returning players then BOOM. Dead. Tabula rasa, while not the same ncsoft fucked Richard Garriot so hard on that one while he was coming back from space.
---
I've mostly grown bored of living world.  The hearts and map completion are extremely mundane tasks to me.  I don't mind the story but its not something you can really repeat.  Once that's over what am I supposed to do anymore?  I've got all the legendary weapons and armor, over 9000 hours of time played.  Diamond rank in WvW.  Dragon in PvP.  I just need new end-game content.  I spent 3 hours last night taking keeps in WvW with my guild and literally fell asleep at my desk because not a single group was online to give us a fight.  It ended up being us killing groups of pugs over and over again.  It was a nice farm but doing that day in and out with no real changes is literally bashing my head against a wall.
---
No worries some people like you also. Ty for finally responding to me in bloodfin and taking my support ticket a while ago serious. You have been indeed checking out much more.
---
Can't be worse than the experts at anet who ran the company in a way that forced NCSoft to lay off a quarter of employees lul
---
Insecurity levels in this sub have always been high. Every couple of weeks we need to be reminded that GW2 killed other MMOs, how the community is better than any community ever formed since the dawn of civilization, and to stop being sad about sad things because it might make people not want to be happy about GW2.
---
Then you'll have to wait until they pick themselves up from the unexpected layoffs that hit their development process and structure. It's not easy for a company to go through such drastic changes in a small time. Be patient.
---
Here is a thing. Right now it is not tech/development issue. It is customer support issue. And as it stands, operative response is the key feature for the healthy customer service.
---
Otherwise people would spend their money elsewhere. Companies either get their shit together in the crisis environment, or collapse. Professional management shines in crisis, not when all thing are easy-peasy.
---
No but not having designers that know how to design mobs and fights for their own combat system was a bad idea.
---
Might it have been a better idea to go with trinity because their own playerbase couldn't cope with the lack of it? Maybe but I don't have any hard data to back things up.
---
Would going with a trinity system have made it easier to hire people who knows how to design for it? Yes.
---
It already has 9 DPS and 4 or 5 healers adding more is just a snoozefest. 
---
They said no planned content for GW2 was cancelled, so if there are any raids in development or even planned before the layoffs occurred, they have already confirmed they are still coming.
---
Well going by the logic of your first comment they could of told us everything for the next 5 months in detail but if raids weren't mentioned.. it's all doom n gloom.
---
This might of sounded like a PR based update, but most updates sound like that anyway.
---
This is great news to hear from Mike Z, but I'm gonna hold my thoughts and opinions of the future of the game for when they give us the content that is promised here. If it's more dead Living World content, I'm going to continue to be disappointed in Guild Wars 2.
---
Mike Z is not going to say anything about future content now that their company is in a turmoil caused by unexpected layoffs. Adapting to these drastic internal changes takes a while and it is better to not make any future promises in a time when the future is unclear.
---
Nice wall of text. Shame no one at anet will give a fuck.
---
big names already stream daily, don't they? and they monopolize like 90% of total gw2 views on twitch
---
what else should they do? not sleep?
---
The same model apers in several human settlement, it's not that uncommon.
---
It wasn't "leaked" by anyone, it's been publicly disclosed [here](https://esd.wa.gov/about-employees/WARN).
---
what does swiss tournament support even mean? I'm swiss and I don't have any friends who play anymore. lol
---
Not just raids, literally any form of REPEATABLE pve content would do. Living world doesn't cut it.
---
As a non-US citizen, I had no idea of that site.
---
I've been patient for 6 longs years. It's time to move on.
---
What makes you think they are working on a roadmap?
---
So no information on expansion? 
---
This so much. A tank who take all the hits so that dps can stand in a corner and dps is not something i miss at all. And i was the one keeping the tank and the raid alive in other games and as much as this was my own choice back then i do not miss it one bit because in GW2 i have to play actively and not hiding behind a tank and everybody matters instead of just two people.  
---
I would like to know: if this is forcing them to cut content as they re-evaluate what is realistic, and if there are now more people or less working directly on gw2.
---
hes the most reasonable person isnt it?
---
Don't you think that they would love to share if an expansion was planned, especially days like these? ;)
---
Exactly. There’s nothing here. No new information, just more or speak and confirmation of content we already new was coming. Which is great, but what happens to the game after that. 
---
Just because they didn't tell us doesn't mean it's not happening. HoT wasn't announced for a long time after they began working on it. Season 5 wasn't announced for a long time either.
---
*Update From the Guild Wars 2 Team*
---
*Proceeds to give update based on what happened and what the company is doing now*
---
How dense, my dude?
---
It wouldn't even be this year. We have Season 5 next, that's been known for awhile now.
---
I don't expect them to change content currently in development. What I was hoping for was for them to \*communicate\* in this situation, where we know now that that GW2 wasn't the main focus in the last years and that they lost about 1/3 of their workforce, that the best case is not going to be more of the same  (and that's what Mike's statement reads like to me) but that they want to change for the better. I don't care that the results will only show in 6-9 months. It's all so frustratingly cautious. But they need to be bold now, at least that's what I think.
---
Basically ,we already knew everything that was said by Mike Z, LW 5 will take us through to the end of 2020 and besides that, we will get some system updates for different game content.
---
But personally, I also didnt expect anything more than that being announced and think that players who expected anything new (features, expac) to be announced right now probably lost their touch with reality.
---
If you suddenly have 25% of your staff leaving and a bunch of new (old) employees coming back, it will take some time, probably a couple of weeks, to restructure your human ressources, teams and planned workload for the coming years before you start thinking about what you gonna do in two years time.
---
It does also state that companies have to warn employees 60 days in advance of layoffs, and according to this disclosure, they were only given 4 days' notice, so I do somewhat wonder if this is even legal.
---
Maybe they will when Season 4 is finished? Who knows? I just don't think people should expect too much of Anet right now.
---
I want an expansion. Have not heard a single thing about it. 
---
"This is fine. It's fine! The Warchief's genocidal, all of my band are dead, but at least I have grog! This is grog right? I don't feel so good Mr Thrall."
---
Oh wow, now I'm gonna be extra careful not to be toxic in raids ;D
---
No new info except that number, and that they are hosting a job fair next week.
---
No and I'm especially grateful that every profession comes with at least one self heal skill so I don't have to spam potions or keep a heal slave to survive.
---
Gw2 pvp has basically been abandoned, and the community has dwindle into nothing. 
---
Due to the small community Match making is a crap shoot plat 3 players end up with gold 2 or 3 people on there teams, making games unfun and totally one sided
---
And even if there was a community to support the game mode, balancing is so infrequent and not well done that it feels that u have to play certain classes or builds otherwise ur basically guaranteed a loss 
---
The soonest it would probably be revealed is the finale of Season 5, as they did with Season 2 and 3.
---
Your comment itself shows how little you understand the way this kind of industry works.
---
The world restructuring announcement is a year and some change old. The fact that their still just “thinking” about it, yikes.
---
I kinda wish gw2 were to do something similar that FFXIV does. They don't really do a roadmap too much, but each massive updates they do (our equivalent of LS) they will always give out a small ''heads-up'' of what kind of updates you'll see afterwards. May it be just a small feature or w/e, they'll list it, and you can know what you're in for for the next 2 to 3 months. That, at least in my opinion, would be a small step in the right direction.
---
Wishful thinking of players who are desperately looking for hope their favorite game isn't dead.
---
I appreciate the slice of info from Mike but i'm sure that i'm not alone when i see the following statement "Our long-term plans for the game like World Restructuring and large-scale improvements to quality of life are still in the works." Do the long term plans include expansions? I don't care whether or not they can define the time frame i just want to know if they're still on the table and i'm sure i'm not the only one!
---
No, you’re not reading this wrong. People see this and get mega hyped. All this did was confirm that layoffs occurred (duh), they are bringing some members back to focus on GW2 and that all content going forward will likely incur a delay while they make sure its quality meets the bar they set and they can get acclimated to a smaller staff, etc.
---
Just the standard “We are still here and are not completely throwing GW2 down the shitter...yet”.
---
Also , they purposely included all realistic avenues of GW2 by referencing PvE, PvP, WvW and SAB. Literally means nothing more than business as usual. Doesn’t mean things will be released faster or that things will receive more updates. Just the standard boiler plate reassurance that any company provides.
---
Before you Reddit warriors attack, I can confirm as a company who laid plenty of people off and had to make reassurances to our clients. Different subject matter, but ultimately the same shit.
---
It just means they're following [a different rounding structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X_Hqb7qkW4) that's all.
---
We're the ones who *guessed* that "over 100" meant closer to 100 than say, 199! It's not "almost 200" until then! /s

&gt;Bellevue game studio ArenaNet, developer of ‘Guild Wars,’ lays off 143

The job cuts, amounting to about a third of local staff, are part of a broader restructuring at the studio's South Korean parent company.
---
ArenaNet, a long-tenured Bellevue video-game studio responsible for the hit online role-playing game series “Guild Wars,” is laying off 143 people.
---
The company said the cuts were part of an “ongoing restructuring” of South Korean parent company NCSoft’s game-development and publishing business. A spokesman would not confirm the number of employees in the Bellevue studio, which opened in 2000 as the region’s video-game industry gained momentum. Industry reports peg the number of workers there at about 400.
---
A layoff notice filed with the state on Wednesday provided the number of layoffs and said separations would begin Friday.
---
NCSoft West CEO Songyee Yoon told employees the company’s “live game business revenue is declining as our franchises age, delays in development on PC and mobile have created further drains against our revenue projects, while our operating costs in the west have increased,” according to an email reported by the games news site Kotaku. “Where we are is not sustainable, and is not going to set us up for future success.”
---
Yoon said costs cuts were coming “across the organization.”
---
ArenaNet said it is providing “several months of pay and benefits coverage as severance” for laid off employees and plans a recruiting event next week with some 30 local companies.
---
The main reason you see it a lot on the Tech/GameDev world is that programming/technical-related jobs are nearly as specialized as the different kinds of surgeons that exist, but unlike doctors performing surgery, tech changes quickly and constantly.   
---
If a company hires several people to work on a mobile game, but then the game gets cancelled and no new mobile game is in the works, the only real option is to let the team go as a Java-based Android Senior dev won't usually be able to fill a senior dev position on a Game that is written in C++.  
---
Another reason is that many companies, in both tech and gaming, push out content quickly and don't usually care about quality enough to keep senior devs on staff. The longer a dev/admin/engineer work in the tech/gamedev field, the more money they cost to keep on staff. Since we, as the customer, only care about the quality in so much that it "works" for us, the skill sets of most senior devs end up no longer being needed/cost effective when compared to someone of the JR or intermediate level and so are let go to cut costs.  
---
TL;DR - Tech is highly specialized and devs can't always just be shifted around. Also, we are part of the problem by spending collective millions on sub-par products from companies we know treat their employees like crap.
---
They recieve 2 months worth of salary, so technically it's legal i guess.
---
No argument here. 
---
Mr Foreman was not fired, he left. Anet is not so insane as to fire their most productive employees.
---
I have zero interest in PvP at all, and you would never find me screaming at a game of any type, it's a freaking game lol!
---
True! Same here!
---
&gt; (...) one thing that I have not noticed yet is a call to the streamers (...) So the best way for me to do just that is keep streaming the game as much as possible and I want just call all GW2 streamers to arms (...) I think if we can just keep streaming the game that's the best way to support the game and Anet (...)
---
yes

---
I'm just gonna say that this tends to be the most used excuse by incompetent people.
---
They are already putting out raids and fractals. I don't know why you mention those, they are trying to weave them into Living World cadence.
---
As far as WvW, I'm not sure WvW players want a new map. The last two new maps weren't that well received. Sometimes you don't need a new map for a PvP game mode - League of Legends has been using the same map since launch (which is basically the map from the WC3 mod). I think WvW is better served  with other resources. If they ever do change WvW it might be better simply to do visual changes of existing maps (use a map artist to alter the seasons on EB or something but fundamentally the map remains the same). WvW people would shit all over it anyway "we asked for better servers/balance/population balance and they gave us flowers" but it would likely be the safest way to give variety to WvW without upsetting people with a map like desert bl.
---
I am not saying money=evil. Profit is definitely necessary. Revenue is necessary. I am not coming at this from some anti-capitalistic viewpoint. I am saying that ArenaNet and NCsoft may not be good partners in terms of their goals. 
---
In the same way that a lot of bands hate record labels. They are necessary to get going due to the support money but they didn't really care about what the band is. Lots of artists want to have a platform to create while making enough from it to have a stable career. If you have a publisher who just cares that they make a certain percentage off an artist then at some point those visions will come to a head.
---
There's nothing wrong with a company's goal being to make as much money as possible, but there are also companies where maximizing profit isn't the #1 goal. When these two companies partner up it can cause these kinds of conflicts to appear. NCsoft has the right to run ArenaNet the way they see fit.
---
ArenaNet, though, was founded by devs who voluntarily left cushy jobs at blizzard to follow their dream of what MMOs/Games could be. If they just cared about money, they could've stayed at Blizzard. They could've made GW2 a monthly subscription fee. I just don't see that as being the reason ArenaNet exists.
---
Since, ArenaNet is well known to pay below standards in the industry, they have to retain people by finding those developers who share their culture/goals. If the culture changes, the people who are voluntarily making less in order to be a part of it will leave.
---
*"  We’re welcoming back some familiar faces to the Guild Wars 2 team that had been working on unannounced projects.  "*
---
 This is the only thing I really wanted to see for GW2 sake .
---
We'll find out in a year from now when w7 would've been released "on schedule" I guess.
---
Sounds more like you're not really hearing what he's saying.
---
Yes, it's sad that they won't be at ANet to see their content launch as developers, but the point is *they don't have to be*. Not being a dev anymore doesn't prevent them from seeing the community's reaction to what they've created. It doesn't prevent them from playing it alongside us, or recieving our gratitude and praise if we enjoy it (or, unfortunately, our ire if some people hate it, which I hope doesn't happen).
---
It's nothing to be upset over. Chill out.

Interesting excerpts 
---
I love wow story but I hate gameplay.
---
I love gw2 gameplay but I hate story
---
Player can never win in mmo market.
---
Also, yes.
---
The irony. You do see it right?
---
GW2 doesnt have a strong viewerbase on twitch to begin with.
---
I think that's sad on it's own because it's a beautiful game. But having a call to arms when there isn't a lot of streamers AND viewers is kinda shouting to the deaf, no?
---
Wow! I am very excited to see the excellent match-ups casted by such wonderful casters such as Roy himself. 
---
the fact that its been so long since we got a decent jump puzzle indicates to me that josh probably hasnt been working on gw2 for a while
---
I also haven’t seen GM WonderTree? Any news?
---
“I can do meteor shower with staff?  Sold!”
---
OP is talking about production goals, timelines, scheduling, etc. The reddit experts pontificating about how things should be run are completely ignorant of anything relevant to the actual discussion.
---
Because I assume someone with enough knowledge can spot the difference between constructive criticism and what should be ignored? I mean, seriously? What sort of question is that?
---
You do realize there are some things that you think you know but you only know for sure once someone points them out to you right?
---
pretty grey like always
---
damn.
---
It was so bad at one point people though Gw2 was vaporware. ArenaNet stopped communicating with the community (guru) for several years. I still laugh when anyone bitches about lack of communication in regards to communication and Gw2. Their communication is leaps and bounds better than it was then even if doesn't quite meet everyone's expectations.
---
have you tried "x-mouse button control"? it allows you to set mb clicks to anything you want, even define what window to send clicks to
---
it's not about bg or small maps... it's about every map must have 1 good world event...
---
Hasn't this already been posted in the sub? 
---
Woosh!
---
&gt; A map that gradually unlocks like in season 2.
---
This would be really nice. Imagine; a map straddling a mountain pass, where the opening of the pass was a group instance one could even call a new dungeon!
---
Part 1 releases, story concludes with replayable dungeon content, part 2 of the map opens up with a delay once the pass is 'secured' off stage by NPCs 'later on' in the story.
---
It doesn't appear as though that's the case. As per the document:
---
&gt; Generally, the WARN Act requires companies with 100 or more employees to notify affected workers 60 days prior to closures and **layoffs**.
---
Oh, I hadn't heard that.  It's far less inspiring now.
---
ye,their post have 0 value.
---
&gt;The only thing that will save this game from a death spiral of "dead game is dead" perception (false or otherwise) is Anet to cut the bullshit, tell us what they have planned, and stick to it.
---
This isn't as straight cut as you think it is. I work in tech, we definitely do Roadmaps on a regular basis, but **most** of the roadmap is not public to our customers simply because we cannot guarantee that X feature will be ready by Y Date until we start working on it and have had time to get into the weeds of what adding X feature actually entails.... as such launch dates are withheld from almost all customers until \~1 month before launch (with a few rare exceptions).
---
This is because otherwise it puts undue stress on the staff to be "heroes" and work 60-80 hour weeks just to get something done in a (more or less) "Minimum Viable Product" state.
---
We, as gamers, complain about how devs get treated on a regular basis, but then demand that we get roadmaps detailing months of content way ahead of time. Like it or not, that expectation ***contributes to the problem of how Devs are treated***. These kind of expectations are from dev practices that (at least in the tech world) are 20+ years old and largely considered "legacy" (unless you work for a company that still works like it's the 90s.... and many do still exist and tend to not be good to their Devs/Admins/Engineers.... I know, I've worked for some).
---
Welcome! Hope you're enjoying yourself despite the current situation. It's a fantastic game that's been giving me great entertainment for years. 
---
Well, in the post he does mention that the team is going to continue stories about the dragons and the conflict in the mists. I took the conflict with the dragons to be a clear sign of the living story, but raids and fractals have been centered around conflicts not on the surface of Tyria. I took the second part as a reminder that both will still be worked on.
---
I feel like that's why ArenaNet does games without subscription fees. 
---
It allows them the freedom to place games on back-burner status and start new things. 
---
Yes it kind of sucks from the player side, but it removes the requirement to always be adding to a game that may have run its course in the developers eyes. I loved GW1 and when GW2 was announced I was so hyped. I still remember the beta weekends and when I first was allowed into the game, I definitely felt the wait had been worth it.
---
It's an unpopular opinion on this sub but I truly believe that they were wrapping up GW2 in the same way they wrapped up GW1. I don't have a problem with it if that's what they were doing. If they founded ArenaNet with the ideal of always making a better game, even if that means moving on from your current project, they have my full support. I'm not paying monthly. I've enjoyed GW1, and GW2. I've gotten insane amounts of entertainment from their titles for barely any cost.
---
I've been playing these games for 14 years now. If I had played WoW for 14 years the subscription alone would be $2,520 + $50 per game (I don't know how many they're at now). If they had felt they ran their course with GW2, then they have my support to move on to the next project.
---
Dude, do you even know about the huge about of teach and carry ressources out there? there are alot of people dedicated to doing this.
---
Also people don't just want more raids, but more challenging content in general.
---
Back in the days of paying to repair armor, change traits (only in a city), and precursors that shared basic non-unique icons with other exotic weapons...
---
Wish I’d thought to run dungeons for the purpose of buying gems back then...
---
Well since we are talking about not knowing a thing, that's exactly one of the problems, the lack of transparency. Players have no idea whether this game will sink or not because they don't speak properly, and when they do speak all we get is some PR bullshit that basically tell us nothing and makes it seems they still want to focus on other projects when NcSoft made it pretty damn clear they are fucking up the main game.
---
Well its not like they are a serious trustworthy organization.
---
Because the release caedence is low, we lost a number of devs tied to those modes and because they just said releases will face further delays, when the last season of LW was already consistently 1 every 4 months.
---
Heck we haven't heard about alliances for ages and swiss tournaments have been mentioned on and off for nearly two years now.
---
Yeh kinda.... 
---
Gw1 you had the ability to take any 8 skills from your profession and from your secondary profession. (1 of them could be an elite skill)
---
In the main people tended to run similar builds, but the sheer range of things that you could do with all the skills was staggering.
---
That and PvP there, when it came to GvG, was actually pretty amazing. I still remember having to do /jump tests, to see how slow everyone’s lag was from something being said to something being done in game, while on comms. This was mega important as everyone needed to adapt for each other’s lag perfectly so you could all hit your skill at the same time on the opposing teams healer to just nuke them to death. One person too soon, the healer would shield and everyone’s elite would be on cool down and you’ld be a bit fucked.
---
It was just a REALLY different game.
---
I learned to love GW2 for what it is, which is a very different game from GW1; however I know a lot of players from gw1 just left and never looked back as it was just too different.
---
What hurt me and a lot of players also was the different server structure. As gw1 used towns as social hubs but the outside world, was a unique instance for each party. (Yup no bumping into people once you left a city. That was your map and your map alone)  anyway this seemed to allow for people to jump across server hubs in America, Europe and Japan as much as they wanted.
---
It was incredibly common to have guilds that were American and European; when GW2 came along, you had to choose to play on American or European servers and it really screwed my old group of friends. Many didn’t want to play on the American servers, but then many of the Americans didn’t want to play on European servers... as the time differences meant when people played from their respective times, the zone would be dead.
---
So it kinda scuppered us.
---
If they made a GW3, which again completely reinvented GW2, while just keeping the GW lore (and even then only kinda... as GW2 kinda moved away from a lot of guild wars lore too); I doubt I would follow it for the ride this time.
---
Nobody is giving away their stuff and quitting, the game still feels just as alive as it was 2 weeks ago... its just the "vocal" people who were maybe looking for something ,anything new to bash on anet thinking it will make them better somehow..
---
I suppose you are right in the sense that they won't have a sense of pride within an office setting, but realistically that is about all they miss out on. They will still see the community enjoy their work, and still have the ability to be thanked for their work, it is solely the office atmosphere on launch they will miss.
---
I have appreciated the lack of reliance on specific others for most activities. You can't solo everything, but you don't have to wait on specific specs or professions to get the job done.
---
Experimentation is part of the Development process, especially when looking to create a new product to supplant or replace an existing one.... especially since the existing product ***never*** lasts forever.
---
Trial and error, R&amp;D, "Dumb experiments" are how products are found. Much of the technologies that we use today for everyday use or even entertainment didn't come from existing product work, but from employees working on "Dumb experiments" in an attempt to find a better way to serve a customer.
---
5 month breaks between episodes is not something I am relishing tbh 
---
Definitely a fair point regarding new/old players. But for me, and some others at least, the wide array of “always relevant” things adds to the replay value of each simply because being able to mix things up keeps things much more fresh. 
---
Lets say im playing a couple gw2 sessions a week, and i have 50 total “quality” things to do, and 3 of them are new, and 9 i havent done “ in a long time” Lets I do the 3 new things, and then i do something i havent done in a long time. Then another, etc looping until ive done all the things i havent done in a long time, maybe interspersing new things a few times in the loop or very favorite things.
---
By the time ive run out of replaying the 9 things i havent done in a long time and the 3 new things, more things qualify as “i havent done this in a long time, so its reasonably fresh.” This of course loops a reasonable amount until theres more new content, or i go on a pvp binge or something. Factoring in alts is multiplicative as long as the content is different feeling enough with a sufficiently different playstyle, such as healing or chrono support. (Plus, alts in gw2 dont have to catch up on gear grind like in wow/ffxiv, and are way easier to get up to speed initially, so that multiplicative replay value is easier to get)
---
So this is why i get bored fast in ffxiv, but dont in gw2. I can just vary between the vast amount of content i reasonably like, mixed up with alts. This makes it to where i dont really relate to people talking about getting bored with gw2 just because they dont make raids fast. (I also enjoy challenging myself with solo challenges in lws more than most people.) Im at 1700 hours played, been playing since 2015, for reference.
---
Thanks, thats very constructive of you
---
&gt; Do you think "random reddit users" do not have management jobs?
---
Well, random reddit users for sure do not have management jobs *at Arenanet*. I don't see anything wrong with stating opinions on your personal experiences as long as you understand that things may be not the same in Anet's HQ. 
---

---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/auqund/numbers_are_in_close_to_a_hundred_people_lose/
---
And this very post
---
&gt;Industry reports peg the number of workers there at about 400.
---
I know that's estimates, but that's the best we have right now.
---
True, we don't know what the structure of Anet will become, but since there's the newer news of GW2 becoming the main focus again, I'd guess that means more than a half of the people are going to be working on it again.
---
back then, you also had to farm a couple of hours to earn 4g.
---
I remember not having the 1g to unlock my elite skill when i dinged 80 after launch and it took me a couple of days until i could spare it because i prioritized updating my gear from masterwork to rare.
---
I would like to know some details about those unannounced projects tho.
---
Like many people have assumed so far:
---
Anet decided to scrap the third expansion and instead keep the game running with only LW episodes as new content while they worked on other projects.
---
That apparently came around to bite their ass, now they have no expansion in the works and still have to throw around ideas for an expansion, which could easily take a few months.
---
If we're being honest, we'll probably only see an expansion by 2021 if the game even lasts that long with only LW.
---
It doesn't matter *when* the lay off happens, they will always have unreleased work pending. Yes, even if they get laid off the day after a patch.
---
He said absolutely nothing but what it does is gives people searching for any scraps of hope so they can read it as great news the game is stronger than ever. 
---
Quarterly Golem Months!
---
I agree with what someone else in this thread said, "Over 100" to me means something close to 100, say 100-125. 143, **to me**, would instead be "Almost 150" or "Just under 150"
---
Now true, people can round differently. Like I said, I round to 50's, others can round to hundreds.
---
According to their earnings report I believe almost half of the companies revenue comes from Korean mobile games they've developed.
---
&gt; Do you think "random reddit users" do not have management jobs? 
---
If someone is truly good at management, would they really be making sweeping assessments of how a game studio is run from afar with very few facts?
---
If my doctor was diagnosing and prescribing medicine to people sitting in the waiting room without running tests or even talking to them I would get a new doctor.
---
The first thing we know about all these ArenaNet experts with "management" experience is that they are making broad judgements of a 1000 piece puzzle with only a handful of puzzle pieces. Why should anyone listen to someone who makes their mind up about ArenaNet when they clearly don't have the full picture? Isn't that a huge red flag on someone's judgement and the value of anything they say?
---
It's standard practice for a studio to successively life cycle games, profiting off of one while developing the next generation.  A lot of companies do this and there wasn't anything wrong with A.Net trying as well.
---
Not doing so isn't the death sentence it used to be though.  We are seeing games with long lifetimes that can sustain a studio for decades or more (League of Legends, Minecraft, and Path of Exile all come immediately to mind).  Online games with big social components seem to be able to sustain this model, and GW2 has those components in place as well.
---
The major sin A.Net committed was eating their seed corn.  GW2 is immensely profitable and there is no reason to think they can't sustain that for many more years.  Strategic actions like cancelling expansions and resource starving your live teams to further focus on far future projects is gross managerial negligence.
---
I think they could go either way, but only after confirming a refocus on their core value proposition.  Work on expansion 3, if it has not already started, should begin ASAP, and I would personally be forming long term resource plans around expansion 4 before I even sniffed a different project.
---
Final Fantasy XIV's story is one of it's biggest selling points. It can rival any single-player RPG's story (especially the Heavensward storyline).
---
When babushka sees your food buff run out
---
Or if you caught on early, you could make bank in Caudecus Manor story mode. There was also the ability to turn a profit buying minis off of the gem store, selling them on the TP and then buying gems. The value of gems in the first few months was insanely low and all kinds of weird things were possible.
---
Yeah and that's the rub. I bet if they were allowed to put out one episode a year, we would get huge, high quality, expansion-level content (imagine either the three maps we got in '18 either all released at once or a single map with all the detail and content of all three maps, all the features like roller beetles, sun's refuge, etc.) but at the cost of player attrition. Personally, I have limited time these days to get into content, so I wouldn't mind this.
---
I agree with you. In a way it feels like they betrayed GW2 by pulling away developers from the game without telling us anything about it. I believe that if they communicated with us about this it may not have been such a fiasco to hear that they cancelled those projects? I'm not sure. But they really do need to communicate, though, they shouldn't also make any false promises that will lead to even more drama in the future if they can't keep them. We tend to take every word they say very seriously and hold them accountable even though sometimes things don't always go as they expected.
---
If you don't succeed, try again.
---
That update wasn’t suppose to be episode 5... just the Warclaw mount
---
&gt; it sounds like they're working on a roadmap
---
Where do you get that from?
---
I mean I always try to stream Guild Wars 2 every time a stream for at least 30min at the top of my stream in order to level my player. I have actually gotten 2 people to get back into the game because they saw the fun I was having as I am leveling my 3rd character to level 80 and taking my second character through POF.
---
It is a great game and I will always stream it and love the game and always support the wonderful devs. :)
---
Boons are needlessly complicated. That doesn't means we, or the original poster, are unable to comprehend it. It just means that it could only gain by becoming more straightforward.
---
In fact, the only reason why we've gotten the current boon/ condition system over the much deeper but also much more complicated hex/ enchantment/ condition trinity from GW1 was to make it easy to understand for every player.
---
What I got from that is people still work for their company and they are working on stuff to be eventually released?
---
I could see them making bank off an official app like GW2Toolkit or something that hooks into the API, so I think it's kind of a testament to ANet's good character that they haven't lol
---
Good luck to everyone and looking forward to this action combat ;D
---
the issue is with GW1 to GW2 is they have started to hype up a new expansion only to then drop it and announce GW2 with some very radical changes to GW1.
---
it was mixed and to this day i would say there is alot of mechanics and design choices i miss from GW1 but i still love GW2
---
I feel like max of 4 classes is kinda harsh on guards especially after the tome nerf and not really representative of what guilds normally gvg with but 🤷
---
Oh was it? My bad :(
---
If they're /factually/ so great at giving us what we want, why don't people agree? Or better, why don't you finance them? 
---
Where exactly did you (and many others) get the idea that there's nothing planned after Season 5? They told us about Season 5 part way through Season 4 so I don't think it would be strange for them to talk about plans after Season 5 at some point part way through Season 5.
---
That's actually a great idea! I might start a new character from scratch as well.
---
r/techsupport
---
&gt; They didn't, they said there would be more delays and apparently s5 will go theough to the end of 2020 which lines up with near 5 month breaks.
---
they said some updates may be delayed and that is probably more related to updates planned in the next couple of weeks or months, not next year.
---
The next episode may be delayed by a months due to restructuring (and all subsequent episodes too) but that doesnt mean that just because there might be 4-5 months between the last and the next episode that every future episode will be released 4-5 months after the last one because they dont have to do this kind of restructuring after every episode, just once before the season.
---
What's gvg? Is it part of the WvW rework?
---
Hmm.. No mention of an expansion. Basically low-detail regarding LW and improvements to WvW,  etc.  These items are of course very much needed to ensure the game remains at its current baseline population and revenue (albeit at near alltime lows) . That being said,  expansions have traditionally been their primary means of driving the revenue and growth that NcSoft expects. Expansions bring in new and retain existing player base.  Honestly this update outlines the bare minimum that is required to keep the lights on.  I can't imagine NcSoft is happy with this, relative to growth and revenue. I appreciate that Anet stepped up and communicated during a very difficult time,  but there is not much to instill confidence. 
---
No, not for hiring into Arenanet. They're hosting a job fair with 30 local companies to help get the laid off employees new jobs.
---
"Bitch, you'd be carrying a knife too if the wasps in your garden were the size of dogs"
---
&gt; i dont really relate to people talking about getting bored with gw2 just because they dont make raids fast
---
I think that's a bigger deal than people admit; people play for all kinds of different reasons, and one of the problems with not only the MMO market, but how people perceive it, is the issue of being Jacks of All Trades. It's not just an issue of what the games are about, but how they're about it.
---
If you really only like raiding, because there's a refresh of challenge regularly, well... GW2 is just not going to hold onto you as long as FFXIV or WoW. But if you like it because it's something coordinated you can do with a small group of friends, whenever you feel like it, GW2 is likely to actually be a much better experience!
---
If you really like world building and open world exploration, GW2 is going to beat FFXIV. If you want world building through story and narrative, FFXIV is probably going to win out.
---
Those kinds of differences I think are very important, but a little below the level of discussion most of the time.
---
The first time I got gems with coin, they were 15s per 100.
---
Well there are people (a lot of them it seems) that think there were no plans after Season 5 when Season 5 has yet to be released...
---
Well i dont think anyone said there would be no more hot/pof like expansions. In fact , both have proved to be a significant profit for anet.
---
I dont think anyone here would like having to pay for elite specs separately in any way or form other than as a package that came with expansion (which consists of a ton of content compared to the usual living world episodes and other free updates we get.
---
But there are some games out there that lock a ton of content behind a paywall and a lot of people are buying them constantly (cause its new content for them to play)
---
ESO comes first to mind as every time they add a new dungeon dlc (1 or 2 new dungeons) you have to pay 13euros for it. 
---
A new zone with a dungeon ,story? 20 euros.
---
A new expansion with a large zone, lots of side quests and a long main quest, few dungeons, a raid? 20-30 euros.
---
Granted they offer a monthly sub fee with a few minor benefits and added "free" crowns (gems) that you can use to permanently unlock such content which you are able to play for free during the time your sub is active.
---
LotRO locks pretty much every type of content out there. You can go to any zone but if you wish to quest you need to pay for a quest pack for that zone. If you wanna enter dungeons you gonna have to pay for a dungeon pack for that zone. Wanna play the newest zone from its expansion? Buy the expansion, or buy it in parts that you find most useful.
---
Anet has been using this model to self sustain them and provide us with content since 2005 with gw1, which also funded the entire development of gw2. And gw1 only had 3 "expansions" for sale, 1 bonus mission pack , and some extra characters, bank tab expansions, no subs.
---
It wasnt till late date they added a handful costumes on sale.
---
If anet comes and says we cant support gw2 with this type of approach and we are gonna have to charge you per living world, and add a optional monthly sub..well then..well just have to wait and see.
---
As for edge of the mist, i think there is a lot of work ahead for anet to do now, and "reviving" or revamping old content such as eofm, old dungeons, living world season 1 and some others shouldnt be a priority for their resources right now.
---
There are old promises to be fulfilled, new fractals and raids to be made, new living world season to be polished, new masteries to invent, balances to balance and rebalance instead of waiting for another 3-5 months of nothing, maybe add something new to the game.... and on top of that, test , polish and finish the 3rd expansion they (i assume) were working on for over a year, and should be ready to hit the market after season 5.
---
I think a lot of people would be more excited on such changes, and to hear anet working their butts of on those things instead of old content.
---
However, since they are adding alliances and people from different servers will be fighting under the same color now (loosing a big part of identity)...would you be happy if they locked EotM away for proper guild vs guild fights only?
---
Since there are 3 keeps, there could always be a type of balance between attack and defend (your keep lord or something) instead of 1 guild dominating the other.
---
Agreed. This isn't a critique of one side, really. I'm just saying that saying that the devs need to have a "thick skin" is not enough given some of the comments I've seen here (the Friend/Ship video bullshit, Mountgate, etc.). At some point, the community on here also has to shut down assholes who are just there to stir up shit.
---
IN TANDEM with that, ANet need to allow devs to talk about more things, address criticism, and to be more honest/pointed with their rebuttals "yes, you're an idiot for telling us 'it's probably like two lines of code!'."
---
Absolutely. Rounding is often necessary, but is also often distracting because it's deployed to blur lines on purpose.
---
&gt;... or keep managing the game the way they have been doing and eventually **become another Wildstar**. 
---
too soon...
---
I escaped from WoW with the expansion after Lich King to Guild Wars 2. I have not ever regretted it.
---
Ep6\* was never meant to be released yesterday, but yes, it's likely that it has been delayed a bit. It'll probably come after SAB.
---
&gt;	Swiss cheese is a generic name in North America for several related varieties of cheese, mainly of North American manufacture, which resemble Emmental cheese, a yellow, medium-hard cheese that originated in the area around Emmental, in Switzerland
---
As example. Thats now how it works :D
---
You deserve to know absolutely NOTHING.
---
You wish to know it, but you don't deserve it.
---
Talk about self-entitlement.
---
Sadly, Lemoncobra, along with a number of our Fruitsnakes is not with us. He's not been with us for several years now. :(
---
I totally agree, I think they should start trying new things with each episode and see if the community likes them, I'm honestly sick of the same "new story, new map, new currency" and would appreciate some changes in season 5.
---
They are and they aren't. If you want to absolutely min/max, a lot of the non-core stats are fantastic to play with. I particularly like how Marauders helps in WvW when mixed in with Berserkers (+/- some Assassins). There feels like a world of difference in boon output with Concentration gear and condition damage with Expertise, but in reality you can complete pretty much all of the raids with just core stat combos :V Optimizing your builds is a fun endgame goal I think, but it's not like your ascended Zerker set is getting devalued.
---
Okay, maybe zerker isn't fair since it's still literally the best for (most) power builds only with a few supplementing in assassins. Sinister still works fairly well in most situations where condi damage is needed. Magi is still pretty solid for healing (a few builds actually take it over Harrier).
---
In game :)
---
Yes, that was a royal brainfart moment I had. I don't know why I thought that,
---
Wow, people won’t like what if you’ve said. But you’re not wrong. 
---
Welcome to our side of the fence, and I look forward to seeing where you land.   
---
It's hard to say without a lot more information - check here: https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/1858/black-screen-randomly-no-crash-or-error-code
---
As I said otherwise, royal brainfart moment. I stand corrected.
---
Yes! Don't listen to the fans who only know the things you've put out and not the ways you may grow in the future. Learn a little nuance for fuck's sake. Just because you don't listen to the person who says "I want more updates to pre-searing NAO!" doesn't mean you don't listen to literally every fan.
---
anet still has at least 1 project going which is planed to finish in 2020 and i think its more likely to be a mobile game then gw3 or anything else like that
---
Don't get me wrong here I totally want an expansion too but we gotta start using our brains here.
---
Season 5 hasn't even started (heck Season 4 hasn't even finished) and the chances of them announcing an expansion any earlier than the 2nd half of Season 5 are stretched as thin as the dev team were before the cancelled projects.
---
&gt; Cal Cohen - PvP/Balance
---
The only guy I know of on the balance team who played ele in PvP at a fairly high level. Ele's already the worst thing to play, after this I should probably just delete mine.
---
Only the greatsword to go!
---
What's depressing is a dev who worked at ArenaNet for 16 years is more realistic than these people:
---
&gt; Anyway, please know I have no ill will for anyone at Arenanet or NCSoft - they made a business decision, one I personally disagree with, but I also don't have all the information which led them to this choice in front of me, so it would be presumptuous to think that I know better.
---
From: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aupskj/matthew_medinas_journey_with_arenanet_team_and/ehecwo4/?context=3
---
If a guy who worked at ArenaNet for 16 years and was actually there during the layoffs (and was one of those laid off) is saying he doesn't have all the information to explain the choices made, what makes random reddit users think they know better?
---
&gt;  ʕ·͡ᴥ·ʔ
---
That would be our GM Galactic Bat. I'll let them know they came up!
---
As I recall, isn't the test of defamation/slander/libel that the untrue information was published knowingly and with intent to harm?
---
To be honest, it's easier to give harsher feedback when we forget that developers are potentially reading our posts. Their silence gives the illusion that we aren't being heard, so giving criticism feels more private and harmless.
---
One thing I've noticed is, whenever a developer talks to the community, the players are more likely to offer polite feedback, and those that don't are more likely to get downvoted or called out for it. On the other hand, when the community feels they are being ignored for too long, hyperbole goes up the roof. That's based on my personal experience.
---
Wondertree is up and about; currently pouring over a chunk of data for me, I am sure - can't see his desk.
---
Don’t want a gw3 at all myself.  Probably ever. Most people I know can barely run the graphics in the game as is. 
---
Keep with making gw2 interesting.  That’s what I want. 
---
Why do you people still insist on saying LW5 is one and a half year of content? 
---
It's not. It's 10 hours of content in the span of 1 year and half. With 3-4 month delays in-between.
---
I remember feeling quite excited for gw2 as i was playing on gw1 as nothings changed.
---
Feelings aside, anet made amazing work setting up gw1 to be fully automated as well as multiple updates to heroes to make the entire game soloable (not as easy to get to that point tho)
---
So people didnt feel the lack of players to play with as much as they would in gw2 or pretty much in any other open world mmorpg.
---
&gt;Hmm.. No mention of an expansion. 
---
"Unannounced projects" maybe.
---
How long have you been playing FFXIV for? The X.5 patch has always been split into two story parts, and is always the last major patch family before the next expansion release.
---
Patch 2.5 was split into two main story parts (Part 1 was 2.5, released 01/20/15; Part 2 was 2.55, released 03/31/15). 
---
Patch 3.5 was split into two main story parts (Part 1 was 3.5, released 01/17/17; Part 2 was 3.56, released 03/28/17).
---
Patch 4.5 (A Requiem for Heroes) is again split into two main story parts. Part 1 was 4.5, released on the 8th of January, Part 2 will be released as patch 4.56, in late March, well before Shadowbringers is released.
---
I personally would keep all of patch 3.5X or 4.5X as just a single patch, even if it's broken into two story sections spread over several months. Similar amount of content to any other major patch, just spread out a bit more.
---
They seems pretty much taking the chance to lay off people who deem not as productive as their payroll should suggest, then recruiting new people that hopefully more productive.
---
I want to not wait 2 extra years for new elite specs
---
It's less than a lot of guilds were running.  Just takes some adjustments though.  Most guilds on this list have been scrimming one another under the new rule set for practice.  
---
As he confirmed it? 
---
&gt; People looking to get into the game are going to see the dumpster fire of comments will go somewhere else and may never return.
---
The community needs to curate itself. If it can't, there is nothing ArenaNet can do. It's not a fault of ArenaNet that people are spreading rumors, misinformation, conjecture or just bad faith lies. It's not ArenaNet's fault that this sub is upvoting those things. The solution to this problem isn't action from ArenaNet, it's the community exercising self control.
---
I have a hard time believing that any mobile projects , would be something I would care about. And these projects were blatantly stated to be "non-GW2"  , an engine update for GW2 would be by definition a GW2 update. And the "best nothing" ? Not necessarily. A-Net hasn't shown particularly good judgement in a lot of their design decisions, and NCSoft's focus on profit , might lead to more focus on pure content , not LW focus , which I would consider an improvement. And I never mentioned Cantha. I know the reasons given for it's exclusion. I just don't particularly care . I would rather see NCSoft put boot to ass and say " they all want wvw alliances , and build templates , and content. make it happen so we can make money , damn it" . Do I care that the base motive is profit ? NOPE. It's a business and we are consumers not investors. I want stuff I want , for which I will give them money.
---
Shortened version of your last point - The trinity in GW2 is healer/dps/support, instead of healer/dps/tank.
---
People are absolutely free to think about and analyze whatever they'd like, but the issue arises when someone starts making definitive claims with incomplete information (definitive, in this case, being claims which they present as the truth but actually aren't entirely true). By presenting their opinions as fact (typically in a fairly well-written manner, making them sound believable), these "armchair experts" cause ignorant and untrue information to be spread, making it harder for people to learn the truth of the matter and sometimes leading to unecessary panic.
---
Thanks for the detailed reply :)
---
The living story is bad and the content lasts 1-2 hours tops!  Focus more on wvw, pvp fractals and raid content that can last longer. esp wvw.
---
That last paragraph is the key.
---
It has become painfully clear over the last 6-7 years they don't know the strongest part of their game from the weakest part.
---
I don't want to be rude, but I have no idea how you can in good faith believe the story is the best part of your game at ANET. It is passable at best, and sure it has improved over the years, but if you really want to make story your shit, then you have to make some huge changes to the personal story, huge changes to seasons, fucking hell season 1 is literally an npc dialogue. What good is having a sick ass boss battle instance in Episode 5 season 4 if getting there is largely a trudge. Players aren't gonna stick around for that. Not to mention, they scratch bare minimum in replayibility. 
---
They should always have focused on promoting this game's combat system. It is almost as if they don't appreciate how excellent they have made it. This game is in one of the poorest states (in terms of neglect/new releases etc, not internal systems) and hasn't gotten the proper love from Devs in ages, yet how is it still the best combat system i have ever touched in an MMO? ESO is janky/clunky garbage (specifically the combat I mean), FF14 makes me feel like i am in 2008 again, WoW is aged af, but a different audience entirely anyway, Runescape, I mean, speaks for itself.
---
In fact the only contender I have heard is BDO, and that isn't getting western praise for business practice any time soon, so what are we doing here ANET? Why not capitalise on your strongest core foundation, your game's fucking combat, not some cartoony story which is memed on so much because loads of players find it boring/cliche/laughable.
---
Market your combat system, focus on your PvP/WvW, make it big, add game modes, push your combat system to the limit in Raids/ Fractals, even in dungeons, add hardmodes and new cosmetic sets for hardmode currencies in dungeons, do something other than tell me about Taimi's deteriorating health, PLEASE!
---
It complete was. Anet destroyed GW1 pretty quickly. GW2 has lasted longer then GW1 did.
---
&gt; What is the alternative? To have everyone stay shut?
---
Why try to solve a puzzle when you only have 1/4 of the pieces? The part picture you form could completely misrepresent the whole picture.
---
NPCs clothes.
---
So you'd be an engineer.
---
This isn't an issue of entitled fans rabidly asking Anet for more information out of the blue. It's the consumer asking what the plans of the game are long term, and basing their continued support of the product on that answer. This isn't a hype situation, it's a "you just lost a quarter of your staff, what's next?" situation. 
---
You're right, there are other games out there.
---
I've been playing since vanilla. I stated I'd be surprised if they didn't release prior to Shadowbringers. Again a content patch is a content patch. 
---
This character model is present at a few different places in the game, but there are differences between now and when it was released.
---
The most common variant was an old woman leaning on a cane with both hands in front of her.  A more rare variant was an old, hunched woman concealing a knife behind her back (most notably, the Brisbane Wildlands Hero Point in the swamp).
---
Somewhere along the way, the animation, equipment, and rigging for these models ended up merged, resulting in scary grandmas all over Tyria openly brandishing daggers.
---
An indicator of troubled times in more ways than one.
---
more events=more bonus weekend(or week)
---
yeah, i think i got more gameplay out of the swim speed infusion update or the bandit executioners than the last living story episode 
---
Well, those are the official lyrics though ^^'
---
As Aurene is the last hope against the final doom, it's like a chant for a god, from the point of view of the zephyrites, I'd say.
---
&gt; They seems pretty much taking the chance to lay off people who deem not as productive as their payroll should suggest, then recruiting new people that hopefully more productive. 
---
The recruiting is for the outgoing people; they're trying to transition them out. Which is better than handing them a check and a boot in the arse.
---
Done, just posted the link on reddit. ;)

---
Why should we "deserve" all this things? This is a demand without valid reasons. It's just "*oh, something happened, give me give me give me!!!*".
---
Yeah I definitely think we need more automated launching platforms that don't ever land you in the right area.  
---
&gt; Well, those are the official lyrics though '
---
I know. It was not my intention to mock cover artists.
---
&gt; I mean less people now working on a game that was already in maintenance mode for some time
---
GW2 never was in maintenance mode, wth are you talking?...
---
&gt; It's not. It's 10 hours of content in the span of 1 year and half. 
---
Wrong! It's more with than 10 hours.
---
I can be pedantic too.
---
And why do we people say that? Because the 1.5 years of production are a given. We don't need no roadmap to confirm this. It's how the game was handled for 5 years now. I think 1.5 years is a long enough timespan to not cry about that the game is ending soon.
---
What more proof do those skeptic people need anyway? A 3 year plan? 5?
---
While leveling the open world is harder, once you're above CP160 with epic or legendary gear the standard open world doesn't pose much of a challenge. At that point however you can start to try and solo/duo world bosses (very different from GW2's world bosses btw), which is certainly challenging. However it remains true that most of the challenging aspects in the open world is removed once you're above CP160, but that's why there's Veteran (a harder difficulty level) dungeons, trials, and arenas. Most people like myself are playing the quests for the story anyways, when I want to be challenged I sign up for a Veteran Dungeon or PvP.
---
Of course it is our business, why I will put more money in a game that I dont know what will deliver. Stop this crap that they dont need to tell us.
---
Look at Path of Exile, they even tell us what they plan for next year, already saying that at their event at end of the year they  will reveal a big expansion that will update PoE graphically. FFXIV get developer letter every month saying what they are doing, what they plan to do and so on.
---
If anet doesnt want to share what they are doing then I dont want to wait to see if I will like it or not, because there are dozen of other game that share so I can invest in it, not going blindfold.
---
Yeah i'm kinda getting impatient to see my necro get a hammer/mace, i know it's going to happen, i just want it sooner
---
&gt;Be patient, see other friends and games if you really need stimulation.
---
But that shouldn't be the response to "There's nothing to do here"
---
I shouldn't need another game to prevent getting burnt out on Guild Wars 2. I should be able to spend as much time as I want playing it without running out of motivation to do anything. I know, that is an ideal, but are we suddenly not allowed those. Also **that is how I feel**, not general fact
---
My bad, the little line stopped at me so I thought it was directed at me, sorry for the misunderstanding!
---
"The game dying" was my jab back (erroneously at you 😁) since the point of my post is basically about the game not dying. 
---
From a quick search, yes, but if they had 430+ employees before the layoffs they would have terminated less than 33%.
---
I'll have you know I bought one whole Soldier's weapon! And had a Valkyrie's drop the other day...from Teq.
---
And that is assuming any of the people being let go even have all the info about this move, which they probably don't. That's one way companies protect themselves from lawsuits, by snapping the door shut on any info other than that "a decision has been made, this is how it will be implemented, and these are the reasons we are willing to give for this decision".
---
I will be watching Roy. Support the scene!
---
Oh it's the old TP and Exchange. The old exchange with the graph was cool. The old TP was awful and slow though, glad they redesigned it and fixed the connectivity issues it had.
---

I made a ton of money early on ( enough to buy everything for gems that I wants , but thee wasn't much TO buy lol ) , just mining orichalcum. At launch ori nodes spawned every hour just like any other , not ever y24 hours, and it sold like mad.
---
During the Lost Shores event (Nov. 2012) a Legendary Precursor dropped for me, sold it on the TP for 100ish gold. It was like a fortune at the time. Hindsight wishes I traded it for Gems at the time because I quit shortly after letting it rot until I came back and the value it once had was gone.
---
if you check to the original lyrics of Aurene Dragon Full of Light, and you check Fear not this Night lyrics, you will see how perfectly those songs are complementary.
---
Aurene, Dragon Full of Light is actually the answer to the Pale Tree's song. Fear not this Night, because Aurene is the Light that will guide us.
---
That's why I believe that Aurene will commune with the Pale Tree, as the lyrics of both of those songs "communed". 
---
No, it is what Anet always did. The bare minimum of communication. What did he really say here? Already developed patches will come eventually and the devs won't drop the game like hot coals. They could not have said less if they actually tried and they had to say something. No plans beyond the absolute immediate mentioned. No admissions of guilt. A vague "we'll refocus", which means nothing, as they gave us no reference as to what they consider focused content creation. 2018? 2017? 2016? This was empty. Vapid.
---
Yeah raiders so spoiled in this game. WvW too. PvP? Oh wait.
---
Anet created a great game, 5 years ago. Then they failed miserably at managing it which is exactly what's fucking them over now. Unless you're into only LS, there's nothing left. 
---
And despite this subreddit thinking LS is like 99% of the GW2 players; it's not. 
---
Now please go spend whatever you want. Personally I'll happily pay for quality content, but there has genuinely been only 1 patch I cared for since 2018. 
---
Dont bother with harriers idk why ppl insist on doing full harrier druid. Its completely overkill on might. You legit can do full magi with peppermint oil, monk runes and concentration sigil (cheap af now) and be absolutely tanky with all that hp and have around 40% boon uptime. If you play druid enough youll understand why im saying overkill on might. Dont blindly follow crap on SC website. Their page is good starting point to raiding but please tweak it to your circumstances. They wont teach you experience for individual bosses and how to heal and deal with mechanics on different types of groups. 
---
Speaking of gems, I just bought 8000 units. The gold to gem ratio will probably continue to rise so thought I would buy now when it's "cheap".
---
I miss duel classes.  And I really miss being able to design you're entire build.  
---
&gt;my jab back
---
I assumed so, all good my man. I'm personally in the positive camp too. This could be good for the game but I question the future for the company on a whole.

Nothing he said wasnt true.  Like it or not but Anet is in this situation because of their own doing.  Their model is not effective, they squandered time and resources, and NCSoft told them that isnt going to fly anymore.  They got their hand slapped and were told get back to work. They had better listen because NCSoft isnt scared to pull the plug if they think its the right decision for business.  
---
killing the games\* because not only arena net suffer from this. But NDA is thing that actually help to build hype if it's planned. If every info leaked the moment it implemented people will be fed with news before game release and forget it. That psychology of modern people. Not companies done this (at least not singlehandedly), but computer age where internet and PC is everywhere, and now you must ATTRACT and KEEP your players interested for a long time period.
---
And in current situation - community managers CAN'T say a word without command above, because it's risk for their jobs, and devs who not work now also sign it, so they can't expose anything for a few years, without risk getting their ass sued. 
---
&gt; It's an organic game mode built by guilds that WvW that try to purify zerg vs. zerg combat and put it on a level field so that the best WvW guilds can figure out who is the best at ~~fighting~~ **team build comp**.
---
Can't answer for this guy, but there are a few things.
---
1) Crosshair customization - size, transparency etc.
---
2) Hide crosshair when out of combat.
---
3) **Fix Snap Ground Target**. Right now you choose your target area, then cast, then the projectile goes where you originally aimed it before you started casting. Useless as soon as combat has any mobility.
---
4) General UI improvements. Hide UI elements. Allow players to move the skill bar further up to no longer split attention between character and enemies.
---
try to do "ilvl synced" especially for bahamut. they have various amazing phases that due to people's ilvl will get skipped and bosses will blow up in like a minute
---
I feel that, while your argument is well though out and all, I feel differently on a few of your points.
---
\- " ...GW2 will probably be gone " I only have to look over at the still active GW player base to see that this will probably not be the case.
---
\- " The walls are here". If you look at the world map, even today there are yet to be discovered regions that are ripe for the plucking. I feel there are still some things that they can do. Maybe they reboot dungeons. Maybe some sort of mini-game (remember Polymock?), a new worldwide scavenger hunt, etc. I feel there is still plenty of jelly left in the jar ;-)
---
\- creative boredom. Yeah, here's a legitimate point. But with a project as massive as this, a dev or artist can likely move to one of many different shops/departments within the studio and, while still contributing to the overall product, benefit from a virtual 'change of scenery', if you will.
---
True enough, but I was responding to the point that GW2 is their *only* project that they have to make solid otherwise the company tanks.
---
I work in public sector so perhaps there are different rules there than in private
---
I sincerely hope you are never in a position of power over the jobs of any number of people...
---
Exactly what i did, took me around 5 seconds on that page
---
I guess you're right. These current skins are just so trash. Hopefully the chest around SAB time has some interesting loot.
---
Saw that. It's a step in the right direction, although quite late. But sincerely: They can do whatever they want, I'm so over the point of caring. Have fun playing :)
---
That's just cheap PR talk.
---
We need a roadmap, as soon as possible.
---
Wouldn't surprise me if they did just under that percentage to just barely dodge that law. NCSoft is a VERY slimy company after all.
---
I got the chills while listening to this song &lt;3 beautiful!
---
Name of the track is "An Exalted Lullaby."
---
"Seems" being the operative word there. Without going into details I want to respect (and which I honestly wasn't always privy to) being that I was on the team until my departure, the idea that GW2 was ever a lower priority is just not accurate.
---
Remind Me! 9PM EST
---
I remember arguing with a developer (who might be one of the casulaties) about thick skin, specially regarding harsh feedback.
---
His response? Ignore mean feedback, even if it's 100% spot on. That's ArenaNet for you in a nutshell. Someone needs to tell them the company is a job, and not a leisure club.
---
i have family at home lol, coworkers arent family.

You don't get it, if you're not licking their asses then you're a toxic hater, and you should stop playing this game.

That's how the brain of these fanboys works.

Imho you should try them out on your own now. Best way to get to know how they work. At level 80 you will have them all unlocked anyways, so you can't go wrong.

It is gorgeous and without spoil anything you will see it again :)

This game is sadly on its deathbed, there is no way it can compete with ESO anymore. One more year tops if that
---
From the first day of GW1 to the time we managed to spend in GW2 [BKoA] Black Knights of Armageddon salute all the departing Devs we have known over the years. May the gods watch over you.
---
It just bothers me greatly that because you think your tiny corner of the game is neglected (other than the update coming out next week, and the participation decay update a bit ago, and the legendary armor, and legendary backpack, and other rewards that I definitely didn't grind WvW for months to get...) that you don't have any nice things to say at all about a dev who just got laid off? Nobody in the Ben thread was like "well he was a good dude but he didn't make friends with the new instabilities." That's exactly what you sound like right now. It doesn't matter that you're right or wrong, it matters that you're still upholding the whiny attitude that people make fun of WvWers for.
---
What do you want for WvW? A living world?
---
I was quite hyped. I religiously followed every update they released on the site they used back then for GW2s development.
---
https://soundcloud.com/arenanet Here you can find pretty much all music for the game. 
---
I wish it was like that now... (ok I don't, because it would mean that no one buys gems any more, but still...)

You really would never want a Gw3? Alright dude..
---
This makes me want to start a Aurene based Religion. 
---
have you ever watched a warframe stream or followed any of the devs on twitter?
---
To be fair i don't know most dev names, i have sent others some letters in game as well and Gaile's is the only one i kept because i still remember her from my good ol' guild wars 1 days. The other letters that i kept were from random people who's names made me laugh and i just look every now and then to cheer myself up. But if i needed to clear space, those names would go.
---
The dream. Would love some more QoL updates to GW1, such as DPI scaling.
---
Best of luck to you. GW is one of those games where you can just feel the love and soul put into it. It feels handcrafted and I'm sure anybody who could succeed there could succeed anywhere.

I remember getting 10 silver during the Ashford Plains beta being a big accomplishment for myself for that sweet sweet [Adept's Training Manual](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Adept%27s_Training_Manual).
---
I don't really buy shit from the gemstore because I desperately want it. Frankly I don't care enough for that, and can always use gold. I'll buy gems / expasions across multiple accounts if I want to support them, and not if I don't. And currently I don't see any reason to throw money their way.
---
You do whatever you want with your money, and i'll do the same with mine. 
---
holy shit jyc what the fuck this is so good

---
I think the hardest pill of GW2 was the collapse of alliances and guild wars. I think the notoriety of guilds in gw was a very strong pull for a lot of players. Especially in the days of prophecy where guilds had to fight in HA to unlock end-game areas for their country, and later on in factions when guilds held control over the deep/urgoz etc. There were real tangible efforts that had to be made and the accomplishments were felt over the entire player base. It was awesome.
---
Focussing on barely or not replayable story content doesn't keep the social / interactive part of an MMORPG running. The game needs to incorperate this in their content patches especially if they want to remain subfree and avoid predatory sales in the gemstore. 
---
I'm sorry about all of this that's been going on. I hope you and all the rest can pick up the pieces and get back into it with other jobs that you end up loving just as much.
---
I know you had a passion project or two while you were still at Arenanet. Do you still intend to work on them, even if only as a fan project? Or are there others that you were able to entrust them to before you left? I hope they don't die if it's possible they don't have to.
---
Bit of a late reply here, but any tips for feeling less squishy? I have a guardian at 80 but I kind of neglect it because it feels squishier than my ele.
---
This is not enough though..
---
Yeah, I was initially wholly against the ridiculous inflationary robbery of buying them off the TP...but as the game got harder (starting with HoT), I've had a tougher time keeping my Contessa alive without a full gear stat bonus, so I saved up for the "slippers".
---
Just my opinion of course. I loved the game at release - but the focus from that point forward was away from what I wanted personally. 
---
From my perspective. The story was a huge step down. The DLC was much smaller scope. The PvP system had nearly no focus with all of the requests being pushed to the side. The gameplay forced you into a 'do 100 different things', rather than allowing you to just do the one thing you enjoy 100 times. Most importantly, the cash shop had almost entire focus - which was only necessary because they went from a handful of developers to  hundreds of staff. 
---
I stopped playing after a while, so this is more from an Ex-player. But I'm crossing my fingers they're going to either turn the ship around or start from scratch. Again, just one man's opinion. 
---
Amazing! I envy you.
---
i see roy post, i upvote :)
---
Thanks for the long answer, will read later. You have no idea how much this means to me, it's more than I got from anet in the last years.
---
The actual problem is that boons are too spammy. They are constantly applied and short duration with little to no regard for when and where and why. 
---
This is especially shitty in pvp. 
---
"Five and above, give it a shove! Four or less, you let it rest!" - How I was taught to round.
---
Just so we are absolutely clear - GW2 \*is\* massively profitable.  [Arena.net](https://Arena.net) \*is not\* massively profitable.  It's that discrepancy that (we speculatively assume) prompted action.
---
[Also, Hanging Gardens is a big shattered grape snowglobe.](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/387700661)
---
Hmm - the one that I think I would love to have had more time to fully develop was the chapter were Eir met her end. I still think, narratively, it was the right move, especially given how she's come back in a more meaningful way in Season 4, but the execution of that moment still feels like we only really scratched the surface of that HUGELY emotional beat.
---
And as for the perfect story beat, I mean I'm kind of a stickler and am NEVER 100% satisfied with anything I have shipped (I simply move it to "Done" to get it off my plate) but the one I think came closest to being everything I wanted it to be was the opening chapter of "Path of Fire". I really wanted more time with the Herald of Balthazar there (she had a bunch more lines written and recorded, but we cut them for brevity) to sort of establish her as a menacing figure, but beyond that I was happy with the pacing, the flow and the sense that you were in for a wild ride. Looking back on it now, I of course am able to nitpick it to death and find things I would change, but I'm definitely proud of it from the standpoint of it having a good mix of story, cinematic action and combat.
---
I was partially sarcastic. Honestly at this point it wouldn’t surprise me to see them trying to push the everything’s ok narrative.
---
Honest, its a big wait and see, this is obviously PR and how much of it is true we won't know until they show. I hope ArenaNet can keep going with GW2, but I have a gut feeling that we are seeing the end of GW2. Next season might be the last season. If this leads to GW3 shortly after, or it being announced, things might be different. Such a sad thing to say because I have been a fan since the launch of GW1
---
That is a nice theory of how inside of anet looked like and why ncsoft did what they did, while it sounds reasonable, its just a theory.
---
I also wish that after this gw2 will only get better and more fun for everyone, however i wont feed myself with false hope and hyoe of future content until I actually see some of lws5 and next expac.
---
Uh, no. I'm not new. I got into Guild Wars 1 when Factions came out, and I started playing Guild Wars 2 at launch. The number of hours I accumulated playing both games is kind of embarrassing, and screenshotting it would just be some kind of weird flex anyway, so I won't bother.
---
When I was more active, I was in a guild that had multiple developers in it. And I don't mean interns. I mean people like Crystal Reid and Chris Cleary. Though I was kinda done playing GW2 around the time HoT came out, I helped participate in alpha testing some raid content. I've spoken with ArenaNet employees directly in both formal and informal settings, and literally none of them have ever been remotely negative, controversial, or unprofessional.
---
It sounds like you honestly just got some axe to grind. I'm sure there were a few bad apples, and I'm familiar with individuals like Jessica Price, but ArenaNet developers at the end of the day are people just like you and me, and people come in all kinds.
---
Which kind do you think you look like right now?
---
Whether more or less, there are still 300 people at Arenanet and, to the best of our knowledge, only 1 active project (and 1 legacy project, I believe: Guild Wars 1). That's a healthy studio, and sounds like a healthy project. 
---
As players, I think the most important piece of information for us is just that the game has a future; that they still have plans for the game into the future. Their post made it clear that they do, which means the game isn't closing down any time soon. That makes me feel much better, personally.
---
You brushing that off by calling it "histrionics" was just a classy "fuck off", *sir*. Don't be a high class asshole and then hide behind language.
---
&gt; Matthew was at ArenaNet for 16 years and was there this last week. If he is saying he doesn't have all the information to judge the situation accurately what makes anyone think the reddit armchair experts are better positioned to say what's going on?
---
One can at least reasonably deduce that if someone working there for 16 years doesn't know, that's a bad sign. 
---
WARN act ? Sorry to ask, but what is it. I'm not an american citizen, that's why i'm asking. If you're able to explain of course.
---
They read all of it. It's not all the same people, but they notice. 
---
This is the min maxing nowadays. A lot of new mmos discourage dps meters for this reason, but the community usually bypasses it and becomes toxic with numbers.
---
Yes numbers are important, but unless the person is super bad, the fight will go on 1 or 2 more minutes, gear doesnt usually change bad, and gw2 I find actually does a pretty good job.
---
My issue is boons, boons are carrying devices, as a support main in almost every game i play, chronos and stuff are just broken, they provide TOO MUCH utility that everything else is garbage.
---
Of course you can have renegades, but then I get shit on for bad dps even though I got 100% alacrity uptime and help with might upkeep.
---
Yes I'm not pulling 40k AoE on trash pulls but I'm helping YOU pull those big numbers.
---
But yeah min maxing ruins games but it is unfortunately wanted by a large part if the community to flex some epeen.
---
I've been guilty of it too, I enjoy playing soul beast to see those 30k boss dps meters, even though I'm helping my team out less overall.

---
People are so fucking dramatic these days. Ohp, GW2 isn't updated twice an hour, it's in maintenance mode. PUBG only has a million concurrent players, dead game.
---
Less people aren't working on GW2. The layoffs weren't for GW2. There's more people working on the game today, than there was last week. The whole point of the layoffs where to get Anet to focus on what actually is making money, rather than spreading focus on 3 different games, two of which haven't even been announced.
---
For future reference, maintenance mode means the game isn't getting regular content updates. We know a WvW update is coming soon, and an entire living season episode is coming 100%. Even in the incredibly unlikely scenario that that's all we are getting, by definition that isn't maintenance mode.
---
Of course they can bring it back. It can just be a reward for something else.
---
Unfortunately that's literally restating what we already know, i.e. the plans that brought us to the current scenario. If they just had all their focus forcibly placed on GW2 and all they can offer is more of the same, we can only assume they'll continue on a downward trajectory
---
No expac, no future for gw2....simple as that.
---
So they're going to slow production because of this? If they did lose anyone and gain more to their direct team, shouldn't that mean content will come out faster? It's sad and all, but we are the consumers, we want your product.
---
Eh, my guess is they're a little busy figuring out how to handle missing a huge chunk of their people. I'd bet that MOB has convened a whole-company meeting, etc etc. I mean, note how few anet forum posts we've seen (none except for the big one when I last checked) - they're too busy.
---
Plus, it's a bit conspiracy theorist-esque to think they're manipulating reddit, don't you think?
---
To be fair, the numbering on Legion dungeons gets a bit...Wonky.
---
[I used WoWHead,](https://de.wowhead.com/dungeon-item-level-requirements-guide#dungeons-legion-heroic) and also remember as I played Legion. 10 on launch, and 3 added post-launch, with the first being too big for the Mythic+ system, so it got split up into 2 versions for that, effectively making it 2 dungeons. 
---
Violet Hold isn't in the Mythic+ system either, but it does exist in Normal/Heroic as it is basically a room with waves of enemies spawning in, not very exciting to speedrun. It's still a dungeon, if we're excluding all non-M+ dungeons though, we'd be at 23 I guess, and if we're saying Karazhan is just 1 big dungeon that got split up, we're at 22. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/iQmVnvF.png
---
[BFA just has 10](https://i.imgur.com/4nn14We.png) which were available since launch, so...That's easier to digest. [Link to the overview itself instead of a screencap.](https://de.wowhead.com/battle-for-azeroth-dungeons-overview)
---
WoW had like 4 times as many viable specs for the past 10 years thanks to the best PvE balance in the industry but because those specs are not new since 2015 you refuse to aknowledge them.
---
While GW2 had the shallowest meta until one year ago when they finally started working on offering *at least one decent* DPS spec for most classes, not even every elite spec. You couldn't be more biased in that comparison. 
---
Or what? Put the company at risk so more people go out of jobs?
---
We will see if what I am saying is true, when the time come.
---
One was 100%. Multi-platform probably. 
---
Plenty of job descriptions and linkedin profiles to confirm it. 
---
all we always hear is living world here, living world there. i get it, its the majority.  
---
but what about the other aspects of the game? in terms of class balance, raids, pvp and wvw we mostly hear nothing or just get a tiny bit of information.  
---
other companys, for example digital extremes which develops warframe, gets out information early, asks on twitch chat for input and writes it down and also shows much about the development without spoilering the story. for example the melee 3.0 update which is long in the works and we always get tiny gifs and other stuff so we know where they are (since half a year even).  
---
why is arena net closed like this.  
---
the uncertain about aspects of the game and the curve downwards in terms of contentupdates (even living world releases, not just raids, balance, fractals and pvp / wvw) while still releasing a really big amount of gemshop stuff (understandable as its the thing driving the game and the jobs of people) makes even the most dedicated players feel bad. for example me...and i am there since the days of gw1.  
---
what do you think about all of this?
---
I love when this happens in WvW cus I feel like spiderman walking along the bottom of a wall. xD 
---
More, they are bringing devs back to their former GW2 teams. They just need to restructure and move forward now.
---
MH world's team has already released a list of planned content for 2019
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/monster-hunter-world-events/
---
I'm not expecting a point by point release schedule but at the very least, a dev team that can say what they intend to do with the game going forward.
---
They can feed us some platitude about "continuing to be dedicated to the game" or w/e but what does that even mean? Are we getting another expansion? Are we just gonna get LW chapters forever? MMORPG's are only "alive" in people's eyes when the game is getting regular infusions of content. Even just enough to keep people buying skins will be seen as a "dead game". Hell, people fling that at games that are putting in the effort.
---
Anet needs to take this time to reevaluate what this game and it's community means to their company, pick a direction, go with it, and keep us informed.
---
That last part is paramount because if they just keep up this "freeze out everyone because we're shit at PR" business, the "dead game" memes will only get hotter and heavier and no one will have any evidence to prove otherwise.
---
&gt;(they were super cool!) but that's not up to me to even suggest at this point.
---
You're killing me. :p 
---
I do hope they're not cancelled and we'll learn about them sometime. I was always excited about the prospect of Anet branching out. Even if one of it is 'just' a mobile game.
---
My point is this was a special reward only for those that won the tornament and those that came second. If they give it to anyone it is not special anymore.
---
You're not paying a sub, give them time to reorganise and get their shit together. I'm sure we'll get more definitive info once THEY know what's definite.
---
If that’s the way you’d like to phrase it. I simply said it wouldnt suprise me.
---
If the tornaments comes back then sure, but again it is rewad for the server that won and the server that came second allthough their was silver color. So it wont be for all players.
---
It also hurts that in most cases, a credit card is the better method of unlocking nice looking cosmetics.  GW2's cash shop really does compete pretty hard with the cosmetic endgame grind
---
Almost reminds me of early on in Season 1 where one episode was a story instance with Braham, and another episode was the Molten Facility.
---
That could be an interesting idea for mastery but it would require fitting environment, like mountains - somewhere in Cantha perhaps? 
---
Easy to perma stealth on deadeye, hence the point of this thread.
---
My point is that they have made outfits that could have been turned into armor sets with about 5 minutes of dev time, certainly this isn't the case for about 70% of them. 
---
In gw2 fashion wars is an important aspect of the game and it has a significant effect on player retention as well, in an mmo most players that care about their in game look want to look unique, that is quite difficult to do in Gw2. 
---
In regards to Eir's death, I'll try to word how I felt about it but it's not very easy because it wasn't done poorly, but I felt like she just kind of let it happen. Like the expression on her face seemed very human-like but at the same time it didn't seem to show fear or anything like that, so if the intent was for her to be petrified with fear and unable to think or act fast enough to save herself then it just didn't come across that way for me.
---
Narratively though I feel like it was fitting because it opened up the option to have a dispute between Braham + the MC and have them go separate ways for a while, it also helps put into perspective how dangerous the elder dragon is when meaningful characters get killed.
---
....don't recall source, but it was gen2 was absolute last legendary series....
---
I'm not sure how recognizing a backhanded comment for what it is makes you think that I needed to look it up first. Actually, that makes no sense whatsoever, it's a logically unsupported jump from sketchy premises, and you only said it because it's superficially witty but falls apart on closer inspection.
---
So, on-brand for you.
---
Well great, i want that crown that Sindrener have over his head that he got for winning PvP tornaments. It is super cool and it should be added to WvW for anyone to get.
---
And yes if they add tornaments they could again give it to those that comes first and second and it will be limited to those players because it should be special to win it and not up for anyone to get just as i acually do not think i should have the crown either because it is special for PvP tornament. 
---
I think i have made very clear what i think about it and why it should not be open for all to get but for those that win tornaments in wvw in past and future. There is not much else for me to say about this.
---
I agree with you on the point of GW2 skewing more and more towards a traditional MMO and I honestly think that's a result of the game running its course. I think the problem is that players are thinking this game is supposed to be a traditional MMO.
---
If you're used to WoW, you're used to "new" content all the time but I would argue that it isn't really new content. It's just more content. The monthly subscription just funds the continued story telling.
---
IMO ArenaNet uses the story as a means to an end instead of the other way around. GW1 wasn't persistent but they started the limited skill set believing it was a better system compared to most of the MMOs. They probably felt they did all they could do with that game setup. Factions pushed the idea of alliances, Nightfall introduced heros, etc. ArenaNet has been very good at making expansions be about adding onto their games. I would hazard a guess that they don't like adding to a game just to add to a game. After Nightfall I'm guessing there wasn't much to add to GW1 other than just advancing a story line. They believed they needed a persistent world to advance their vision and they wanted to move out of the 2D setup they had in GW1.
---
In steps GW2. Both expansions saw additions to the core game play. HoT with gliding and general 3D vertical movement. PoF expanded on the horizontal aspects available to them. I would ask if you think there is an obvious core system they could still add to GW2? I really can't think of anything. Flying? IDK. What new killer feature would you put into the next expansion?
---
I think this is kind of how ArenaNet likes to operate. Build a world as a means to an end of a game structural vision. Expand it until the structure is exhausted in terms of core features and what the limitations that sandbox has. Then when your game structure vision changes, build the next sandbox and continue.
---
GW2 is starting to feel like a traditional MMO because there's no new core feature you can really add to it. So it goes towards story telling aspects. Raids, fractals, etc, aren't new things technically, it's just lining up the existing features of the platform in different ways.
---
As an innovation platform, I wonder if ArenaNet feels GW2 has run it's course and their game vision needed a new sandbox. NCsoft doesn't feel that's the direction they should be taking and wanted focus to remain on GW2 and making money from that.
---
Hmmm I think this line of thinking is really common, but I think it ignores the bigger picture.  You look at WoW and other popular MMOs, its not about how shiny they are but how resilient they are. Players like to collect and hoard and thus we find that people get attached to MMOs.  GW3 wouldn't be a desire if GW2 received the updates people want in a timely manner.  The graphics engine of GW2 is still amazing and combat is still ahead of the curve, which means they do not need to innovate a GW3.  They need to just keep fleshing gw2 out.  They could get a few more years out of it with the right moves.
---
VR ranks as the 4th place team from what I know of scrims. They could place higher though because they seemed to improve the more they did it.
---
GM Ultra Viper is super friendly in CS tickets. I was genuinely impressed with how engaged and respectful he seemed in what I was trying to contact support about, it's very refreshing to feel like you're talking to a real person that's happy to do their job and help you out with what you need as opposed to a wageslave robot that copies and pastes generic responses.
---
Please tell him about my compliment of him too if you wouldn't mind!
---
Yeah you're not getting this. All you're going to get is even more silence and less information, the game is full maintenance mode - don't even expect another expansion at this point.
---
I want them but I agree- they are really expensive :/ I mean there aren't many alternatives unless you play a Salad Light armor ;-;
---
Sounds good! I'm going to create that guild if you (talking to everyone here) are interested in and it hasn't already been greated.
---
it's a catchy word that crystallizes the wishful thinking of many people subbed here..not saying they're wrong or anything
---
also it's trending because of fallout 76 so i guess that helped popularize it too
---
I am trying to make Harrier ascended armor, and I've read in many places that it is more efficient to craft cheaper gear and stat-swap using the right insignia via Mystic Forge. But how do I know what is the cheapest ascended gear for me to craft? 
---
You hit the nail on the head regarding root cause.  I don't know that I would go so far to say as there's absolutely *nothing* they can do to shape the discourse to some extent, but you're 100% on point that the underlying problem will remain without a culture shift.  
---
And it's not just "r/Guildwars2 is uniquely bad", either.  Susceptibility to populist outrage mobs is a plague that spans many aspects of society to one degree or another in the social media age.  Maybe good for validating people's feelings; not so good for measured discussion.
---
-cough- Malyck -coughcough-
---
Yes.
---
I want this too but the issue is how to monetize it. With LS3 and LS4, it was easy to gate content behind each map because people couldn't enter.
---
But if they do this, the monetization will be like season 2, only achievements and *some* (mostly just story) collections will be gated. People will also likely be able to enter instances of friends without having the episode and everyone continues to profit from most likely will be a lucrative new farm and do the map-tied collections.
---
This is exciting but I just don't see Anet seeing this as a profitable method for them.
---
The two tables WP show in the video that clarifies which positios were affected: https://imgur.com/a/jPgHYv1
---
&gt; the server that came second allthough their was silver color
---
close enough :p
---
Agreed on the mismanagement.
---
I mostly agree, but it is nice that you're given multiple routes to gaining the same thing, so if you're really good and can get all the achievements or whatever, you'll earn rewards quicker than others. And if you're not, you can always grind hearts/gathering/events/etc. I'd prefer if playing well got you to your goal quicker than just mindless grinding, and sometimes that's the case, but sometimes not.
---
Personally, I'd prefer something like the griffon or beetle quests, in terms of difficulty/complexity/cost. Maybe the Warclaw can require sieging a certain amount of keeps, towers, shrines/ruins, and camps, talking and/or defending Stonemist Castle, spending supply, killing guards and enemy players, spending a certain amount of some of WvW's various currencies, maybe even completing some of the WvW JPs and/or buying something from the catmander kitties. If they do it right, it could be something that skilled/entrenched WvW players can get much quicker and easier than others, but is possible to get for everyone eventually, with enough time invested, and without "feelbad" design moments like needing events to fail in PvE or having to lose an objective because you can only progress by taking it, not holding or defending it. I'd prefer not to require a buttload of WvW ability points to just unlock it, but I could also see it working like the gliding skills do, emulating a PvE mastery track, so the first rank wouldn't be super expensive, but would just unlock the mount, while higher ranks get progressively more expensive and unlock new abilities and attributes of the mount.
---
The Gendarran Free Company (RP guild, Piken Square) during their Shatterproof campaign, assisting the Pact during the battle in Thunderhead Keep. 
---
I mean, they more or less just confirmed that an expansion has not been in the works, and that after LS5 they had nothing planned. 
---
If this is the case then we’re at least 2 years from the next expansion and the only major content we’re going to get is QoL patches and some LS stuff every 3-6 months (which will consist of a new map, new grind able currency/ gold sink that will be abandoned when the next one comes out, real neat). 
---
I’m at the point where they could even add build templates in 1 months time and I simply would not care. I have 7k hours in this game. I want to keep playing it. They’re not giving me a reason to. 
---
For me at least the reason for running content is it's new, fresh, and fun.  Even without the gear as an incentive I would run said new content at least a few times.  Plus every dungeon, every raid, ect all add in a host of new cool looking cosmetics (the real reason to grind out said gear) for every single Job, so most patches theres usually quite a lot of cosmetics I want to farm.  The game throws tomestones at you like mad for just running the new shiny content so gearing isn't really a problem unless you are doing Savage Raiding (of which I generally just craft an armor set for my main).  The game is very casual freindly, gearing for casual content pretty much takes care of itself since you only need tomestone gear for all but the most Hardcore activities.  Eventually I get bored, and by then hopefully the new patch is on it's way, and if it's not, I unsub for a month or so until it does.
---
Same reason I play GW2, honestly.  My character is already geared up, I have no other incentive to run the content other than it's new and fun.  After a while that wears off so if theres still a carrot to chase after I'll do that.  There isn't as much cosmetics to chase after, sadly, at least none that arn't tied to crazy grinds, but theres general a few things to chase after.  Then I stop playing as I wait for the next patch.

It isn't really a difference between Hardcore/Casual, just what people like to run.  Both games have their casual grinds and hardcore grinds.  It really depends on what the person playing has fun doing.  I get easily bored running the same thing over and over so the cycling content found in gear treadmill games keeps me occupied, where for people who don't mind running the same content and just enjoy running it won't mind the lower amount of content being added because quite literally *almost everything* is endgame content.
---
Yeah, I want live letters where the devs tell us we're playing our class wrong and it's not too weak and then they massively buff it next patch. Bring it on.
---
It’s their gemstore that ruined them honestly. I didn’t care about game stagnation, content is still fun. The economy being tied to the gemstore means it can never get better. Items in-game sell for absolutely minimal profit regardless of time spent; that’s not a good economy. I play FFXIV and I can legitimately make tons of in-game currency by putting in time and work NOT playing the market like you have to do in gw2 to be rich. There’s no incentive to literally play the game. 
---
It was mostly a joke based on the glitch OP faced, but I do think more methods of movements are always fun
---
They would have to approve them branching out wouldn’t they? Since most of Anet’s funds come from NCSoft
---
Lady wears a variant of human female town clothes outfit but guy has NPC-only skins
---
I've studied this image extensively, and i've come to the conclusion that this model is wearing clothing.
---
Wtf is that getup? How could anyone take him serious looking like that?? 
---
It's a more in your face form of progression, it allows your character to get stronger throughout the expansion which some people like.  Also as a sort of side effect of the gear treadmill they tend to get more frequent content because... well they need something to drop that gear.  As of such, some people who might not like the treadmill still might be drawn to said games as they might easily get bored of running the same content over and over.
---
&gt; Ultimately what it shows is disrespect as well 
---
Another answer from me. Don't hate me for this and prepare yourself:
---
Don't uphold the same standarts of "disrespect" to your players as you do to yourself. I personally find silence towards your players as incredibly disrespectful, and it shouldn't be surprising to be met with equal disrespect.
---
And just because something isn't worded as you'd like to hear it, it doesn't mean it was intended as disrespect or doesn't hold any value. You have an international audience, that does not only mean that people talk from a different background of what is considered polite, it also means they are talking in their second or third language to you and phrase things differently. Also, the devs gotta earn that respect. It is not owed as soon as one buys the game. 
---
Always felt like anet in particular was quick to dismiss opinions based on how they were formulated. 
---
GW1 builds had the exact same problem, though. If you didn't immediately ping a cookie cutter build as soon as you joined a group, you generally got kicked immediately. The armor system wasn't any more flexible either, just different.
---
You can find the prices on gw2efficiency.
---
It's really good to hear that you plan to keep playing. Seeing the devs in-game has always been one of the hallmarks of this game for me - it's really encouraging to see a game where the devs clearly enjoy the product they design.
---
This is something you probably can't answer, but [last April in an AMA](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/37818/malyck-and-his-tree) it was mentioned that you had a short story about Malyck that you might pitch for inclusion as content. Was any progress ever made down that path, and/or do you think we'll see anything about him now that you're gone? Does Arenanet retain the rights to implement that? (If not, I may or may not be encouraging you to publish some 'fanfiction,' cough cough.)
---
Can we watch on-site tho?
---
In what game mode and for what purpose?
---
Ventari rev has the highest healing output (especially as herald). Firebrand has the best defensive support with aegis, reflects and stability. Druid has the best 10 man offensive support with boons and spirits (in pve).
---
"Our plans are to deliver what we said we would deliver before anything happened and nothing more than that for now" is not a particularly convincing sales pitch.
---
&gt; pretty amazing healing
---
Druid healing got gutted. It's mainly brought for its unique buffs now, as opposed to before when it was good at both buffs *and* healing.
---
Lunar drizzle anyone? :^)
---
Yes, I mean, if you do this, you will actually destroy the economy. That annoyance is why prices don't collapse in on themselves.
---
&gt;The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN Act) is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration (DOLETA). It requires most employers with 100 or more employees to provide employees, bargaining representatives of the employees (i.e., unions), and specific government agencies **at least 60 days notice** of any plant closing and mass layoff.
---
&gt;The purpose of the WARN Act is to give workers and their families some transition time to prepare for the prospective loss of employment, to seek a new job, and, if necessary, to seek training in a new skill or retraining in an existing skill that will allow the workers to obtain replacement work.
---
That does not sound like what happened here.
---
They have to actually make good looking weapons first. They are on par with fedora nerd art when they need to be at the level of a gay Korean designer.
---
I think the fault, and the problem, lies with how people tend to look at and use rotations. A lot of the time, people see them as hard rules and as "if I do this, I don't have to know how my skills work. They already did the work for me," when that's not the case. Rotations are what you should be doing when you're in optimum conditions to get the optimum dps, but you're rarely in optimal conditions. You have mechanics, adds, or whatever to deal with, and knowing how your skills work is crucial to dealing with those. 
---
If you're fighting Sammyboi as a Condi Banner Warrior (I know, technically not optimal, but the most fun for me, and it has a bigger toolset to deal with mechanics), and your group is having trouble keeping Rigom pinned, switch to your bow and fire a bow 5 to immobilize him, or use Wild Blow or Stomp to knock him back. Sure, you lose a tiny bit of DPS by switching targets for an attack,  but you save a lot of headache. Heck, sometimes you need just a tiny bit more cc to break a bar, so then's a good time to use the non-berserk sword burst attack to get that extra tiny bit of soft cc. Or you're playing Chrono, and your Continuum Shift is up, with 3 clones, but if you don't break this bar, your druid's gonna die, so you pop your daze shatter and work on getting back up to three clones again, besides, with all the alacrity you'll get from CS, wells, and shield 5, your daze shatter will be up again in no time. Or any situation where you're apart from your group or you're all spread out, things get hairy and you need to improvise. 
---
Rotations are a rule when standing still, in a group, and wailing on one guy, in most any other situation, they're guidelines. But people don't realize that and try to just stack and run a macro and ironically, it's less optimal than being able to improvise, and less fun.
---
Didnt they just release a statement saying that?
---
This. GW1 was very niche and wasnt a MMO like GW2 is so it had a totally different audience,  which is why GW2 was more successful than GW1. 
---
Hey, in terms of zones Eureka is *beautiful*, some of the most beautiful and interesting zones I've seen in an MMO for a good while.  It's just the content that needs work, zerging world bosses gets old.
---
its not really cheaper honestly, you spend [~6.2g](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-82882) (insignia + ecto) on [swapping](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing) + spirit shards. The cheapest normal armor should be [rabid](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-47977) but [you can check efficiency to see](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/ascended?filter.type=0&amp;filter.subtype=Coat&amp;filter.weight_class=medium) (Filtered to medium chests, change that as needed). Ignore the precursor armor that is listed as cheapest and the next couple should be plaguedoctor's and seraph's which use special materials. [Harrier's is only 5g more](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-84923). this may change slightly depending on the piece and the material so feel free to check them if you want. Usually people stat swap to alter a piece they already have or avoid the jeweled damask patches in say [viper gear](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-76244) since they use [fulgurite](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fulgurite).

14 and WOW are the only two Mmo’s worth talking about in 2019. Tried and true. Daoc was amazing wayyyyyy back.
---
I promise I'm not part of anets marketing lol
---
But if u can get me a job let me know.
---
I'm too busy drinking long island iced teas right now like proper white trash 
---
Yes a lot of GW2 fans thought/think like that, but back when GW2 was in the hype phase before launch, Guild Wars 2 Guru was nothing but Anti WoW hatred and Anet back then really did a lot of focus on being different from WoW. WoW is not as big today so it's not as frowned upon to use basic MMO features that most MMOs before WoW had like Mounts and raids, but pre release even the mention of stuff like that would get you internet hurt. Anet fueled all of that.
---
Cool edit! Though you guys look like you're standing a bit too still to be effectively contributing to the battle.
---
These guys need to get GW2 on console, it's a massive untapped playerbase with barely and competition in the mmo space, it's been a huge benefit for ESO
---
yeas uBlock Origins rules i dont understand why people use any other it is just superior in any way 
---
This is a pretty down to earth video. I still don't take a side on whether the ship will sink or sail but I do believe the upcoming months are crucial for the game's future.
---
Whoever's left got one hell of a ride.
---
"back then"?? I came back to the game a week ago... I still have to spend a couple of hours for 4g :(
---
How do you make money now?
---
Thanks!
---
They still have 300 employees. That's more than enough to work on GW3 privately until the beta is ready, and still devote enough resources to GW2 to help it flourish. I think the problem they had was working on *far too many* side projects, of which GW3 (or its equivalent) would only have been one of them. I sincerely hope, for ANet's sake, that they keep working on GW3, as long as they dedicate enough resources to GW2
---
Yeah, that's what the developer who's completely shifted to mobile in its latest releases and has now more than Guild Wars 2 has made in its lifetime is going to do, refocus on GW2 development ... It's not like they've killed off brands that were cult hits but unprofitably before so they could reallocate and streamline their profits into the franchises that were currently profitable ... They're *definitely* the sort of guys who go off and restructure franchises that aren't working out to fix them and not the sort that slowly kill off less profitable ones to keep backlash from consumers to a minimum while they begin to reallocate resources to future investments
---
Living the dream
---
Standard PR
---
Lets see how things unfold within the next 3 months then judge 
---
Those earnings reports were for NCSoft, not Anet though.
---
I think they're closer to 250 now.
---
Yep, the biggest MMO on the market is losing players in droves and during that period GW2 releases Beetle racing instead of having a robust stream of instanced content to sweep them up.
---
It's actually derived from a fan-favorite song from GW1: [Crystal Oasis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oFGagjD18o).
---
Balance in its entirety is in a horrid state in the game. I'm not bashing any single dev on the balance team, but the direction that they've taken classes is just bad. Shaking that up is probably going to be very healthy in the long run, still I would rather have seen Cal switched to a different team than leaving Anet
