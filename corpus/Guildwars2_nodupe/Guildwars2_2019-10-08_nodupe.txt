If you read my post, I was not "screaming" about anything. I said "I don't get it" and "it's annoying," but luckily some of the people in the comments gave an explanation to help me understand! For the record, not all of us know/understand every single thing about this game.

I like Xera's better ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Thanks for the tip!

Daaayyyyummmmm

Are Chak eggs rare? I get them from every meta and chests. Or am I on good terms with RNGods? Also, got 2 chests from last week strike missions (I do one per reset).
---
Or perhaps you should like, slow down and confirm what you are buying before you actually buy it? It doesn't sound like a bug, more like user error.
---
Thanks for that! At least some people are helpful to those of use who don't know everything.
---
Different thing of same name. It's confusing.
---
&gt;"*If you read my post I was not screaming...!"*
---

---
Oh? Lets examine that.
---
&gt;*Dear ArenaNet... why is this a thing??*
---
Extra punctuation, AKA diet caps lock
---
&gt;*I don't get this. You spam us with unidentified gear that 99% of the time is utter junk.*
---
Accusatory tone.  "*YOU* spam us with gear that is utter junk! (*HOW DARE YOU!*)"
---
nah it's really way too easy to get limited like this, just like getting restricted after sending a whopping 2 mails
---
I know how you feel all to well. I have over 17k hours in the game and have never once gotten a precursor as a drop or any other rare loot after farming for nearly a decade now. The game is not really rewarding in the loot department. You have to play it for content (every 10 months for me now because I usually delve in the raid scene). The development is slow, the processes are annoying, and everything else \*SKYSCALE\* feels like a complete grind for a mediocre reward.  
---
Lets break this down - You spend 15-20 hours grinding an achievement track \*SKYSCALE TIMEGATES OMG\* and then realize that its the slowest mobility ever.. The bunny can out leap it, the griffon can out fly it, and the god damn skimmer moves faster than it over land. You only keep the memory of the 15-20 hour grind for this mediocrity. Congrats, GW2 played you, you didn't play it.  
---
Now on the flip side, lets say you are a completionist, this satisfies your need for finishing things up and 100%ing the game. Lets say you enjoy revisiting old, dead maps with nothing to do on them for any real reward and do things for some achievements. Or you enjoy doing Daily Fractals, Daily Dungeons, WvW Dailies, PvE dailies, HoT/PoF map dailies - you all of a sudden have an inner sense of reward because you did what you enjoy that day.  
---
TL;DR - Playing for material rewards often is anet shitting in your cheerios; the only real reward is found on the 'good feels' vibe you get from finishing what you want to do on a daily basis.  
---
Pardon any spelling or gramatical mistakes, I don't proof-read.
---
The combat in GW2 is better , that's why AA is just a no go for me .
---
Here’s the better way to manage your inventory: 
---
1) Wait until you get a full stack of unidentified gear
---
2) ID the stack (because you said you want the chance of the exotic)
---
3) Salvage the ID’d gear
---
4) Sell the materials from the salvaging
---
This will prevent the error message you’re getting on the TP, as well as letting you play the game more instead of inventory management, as well as a much cleaner inventory. The materials you get from salvaging always have people purchasing them, so you will see yourself getting money quicker as well. Hope this helps.
---
Ok, you win. GG. Not going to argue with someone with such an asinine name.
---
Chak egg sac* - people who cares about shiny wars are well aware about this infusion, that basically turning you into nyan cat. Rest, like you (no offense) have no idea. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tcW0nXNqj4 here is the demo with mounts.
---
As for rarity, well, it was added into game with release of HoT, 4 years ago, and it still cost around 15-20k gold on player to player markets. You cannot buy it on TP instantly, there is just none.
---
Resorting to an ad-hominem I see. That's about what I'd expect from someone screaming about something so unimportant.
---
I love that sparkling effect though :D
---
Thanks for the ideas!
---
You can also search the trading post by selecting a weapon type and the attribute bonuses that you are looking for. That way you find both generic and named items in the same search:)
---
For example, if you want a berserker weapon just say it must include +Power, Precision, and Ferocity. To filter it better you can set a minimum on a stat, such as saying it needs to have at least +100 power so you don't find assassin weapons in this berserker example.
---
Yeah. they thought people would spend 80 minutes of their lives every day to do repetitive events to open a chest that is or was almost certain to have trash inside.

Mine right now is 43.7 GB

I get a bit of both. I've never had a full inv after T4+recs, although I do have all inv slots unlocked and a bunch of 20 and 18 slot bags.
---
Do you not have copper-fed salvage? You should get it if you don't to save your mystic kits.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Oh, uh, I'd either salvage it en masse or sell the stack of them on black lion.
---
I applaud Anet's decision to not introduce more furries into this game.
---
except wow looks like shit and gw2 doesn't

---
Seriously though, farming is fun.  I love farming (especially GW1).
---
Bird person is not furry
---
I understand your point, and agree with you in the sense that yes, there are different mindsets for different groups. I don't feel negative towards "elitists" so to speak, and would never join one knowingly if meta is all they were looking for, out of respect as you stated. I get it, I really do. I just choose to avoid those types of groups as I don't want to be forced to do something I may not enjoy. Yes, it is a personal opinion, I openly admit that. Not saying it applies to everyone.
---
And yes, I realize WoW is a different level. It was more just to prove a point that GW2 is a much tamer beast than most MMO's, and that GW2 seems to be more flexible when it comes to completing the hardest content using off-meta builds.
---
Subjective. 
---
WoW is also more than a decade old now and built from the Warcraft 3 engine. Despite that, their art style holds up a lot more than GW 2 will in a 5 years.
---
Is there a word equivalent to furry for bird people?
---
It wouldn't be a "furry" it would be a fantasy race, also charr aren't "furries" and have existed since the beginning in GW lore.. nothing was introduced. Just expanded upon
---
WoW also doesn't have a story 100% centric around a specific character. The WoW PC is known as "champion" or "hero", something only being done recently as of Warlords of Draenor (not sure if MoP did this, don't think it did). Not the Commander of an established army that was founded by the PC who becomes a integral part of it.
---
&gt;It wouldn't be a "furry" it would be a fantasy race
---
okay furry
---
Probably not. It's all unified under a single term. Even those that identify with "dragons" and such. It's weird. But whatever, I get off to lesbians doing the wet clap. Who am I to judge?
---
Doing so would mean they would have to present two stories. While possible to write up a split timeline where the Commander is someone else, it's a lot more complicated. And it will only get more complicated the further you get.
---
The best solution would be to detatch the current Commander from the story and make them more generic in their role. They just happen to do all the important shit but without the titles, and medals and all the shit that makes them THEM.
---
This opens the idea of multiple heroes in the story. Which is plausible. You write them up as a legend who's truth has been lost to time. That way they can freely add new races and it wouldn't be a problem. But as the story is right now, changing it and detaching importance from the Commander PC is highly unlikely.
---
Sounds like you should go play WoW.
---
Rally to me Ascalonians! 
---
This meat is RAHHHHHHHH!!!!
---
I swear that Scaley is a term for the reptile equivalent to Furry.
---
why the downvotes? it's well edited, well played, and an interesting build
---
Why would you want more races? Norns and Charrs allready get basically forgotten in the story, want to add more to the list? Better put effort into something that matter then more races, like new weapons or something.
---
&gt; there's no rule saying that if I comment I have to specifically reference the post itself 
---
LOL.  Your off-topic post is off-topic.  You can keep talking past me, but GW1 only had equipment templates in PvP.
---
You don't need 300 players killing each other to be "PvP" on a  "MMo".
---
BIRD PERSON IS NOT PLEASED.
---
Yeah, plus, even if they managed to produce a generic "foriegner origin story" for all foreign commanders, there are other big cost questions.
---
One is how to handle armor on the new race(s). They would need to be careful to use an existing body profile to not increase armor cost by a bunch every new race.
---
Then there is the question of voice actor, in for all future episodes...
---
Damn... some people are just lucky .. i envy them
---
I honestly couldn't care less about new races. I'd rather have any other content.
---
That's not big, just quick candy.
---
If they added Tengu, of course many people would be excited.  But as they soon finish the personal story segment for it and play with it for a little bit, it will be just another cosmetic item and the regular "no content" and other regular complaints will come.  Of course they will sadly no matter what they do.  But cosmetic stuff is consumed and taken for granted much faster than actual real new systems.  That's because races are really just cosmetic besides a short personal story and racial skills most people do not use.  Not enough bang for the buck with new races.
---
Housing for example would be a new system that would have much greater impact.
---
After reading comments, I'm tempted to try AA, but I don't think I'll get to grind efficiently, I cri.
---
I dont think this comparison is fair to be honest. Not only one game is literally being re-released, but one is mainly sandbox mmo and the other is more rpg feel to it.
---
Granted both are or might be considered mmorpg, but coming from a guy that came from gw 1 to Gw 2 the PvE (story) is quite good, the references to gw 1 and events that we never had the confirmation happened.
---
This also adds to the feel of inmmersing into the game.
---
But there is just always this thing from games like AA, its still a invest too much time into it, you might say Thats good, but if you quit guild wars 2 you can just start back at it and most likely still be able to do stuff.
---
In AA, everything is mostly a typical grind, not saying its a bad thing but its something that is not at least for me, good.
---
The reason at least i play games is to have fun, and not to feel like its another job. Its good for People with enough time and that look for time sinking mmos, gw 2 while many claim casual, it does have its hardcore gamemodes if you so decide to play it like that.
---
The experience you get in WvW might vary depending on your guild, Who you run with and What type of engangement you want to get, if you just want to do public zerg you can do it, but you also have the option of joining organized guilds and groups and your experience just changed.
---
Im sure archeage is more dependent on gear, in comparison to gw 2 combat system, since its release it made me look at games like wow and similar combat types, and actually think, wow that was boring.
---
The fact that combat in gw 2 is mostly skill (of course you want at least exotics) makes it fun, its not this guy has 1mill years in the game and have this armor and stats that just go and you have no way to stop it, while in Gw2 no matter how much cheesy build you have, if your enemy is smart and find that you made a mis take, he Will take it and defeat you.
---
Its just more dynamic combat imo, than watching numbers pop up.
---
[removed]
---
I think to learn in PvP you have to make an effort to actually identify what does what. If you just play blindly mashing buttons, as you say, I don't think you'll learn much from the games. 
---
Like... for instance, for warrior, he uses rampage, do you fight him then? Do you know the rampage skills to dodge them? Like "throw boulder" which is a ranged stun? 
---
Or if you don't know them, then you'd either have to pay attention during game and be like... okay he threw this big rock at me and it stunned me, what is that and what does it do. What is the cooldown? Next time, how do I dodge it? 
---
Rather than,
---
Oh warrior op he just runs around CC's me hard and bashes me with rocks and stuff.
---
as if its so hard to come up with plot armor why a race wouldn't have a story in base tyria and a replayable story for HoT called vision or something (like they pulled already on orr btw when the commander had some visions).
---
Why is this downvoted
---
But rather than change the number of intractable problems that is me, I'd prefer that Anet simply do what they said they were going to do and fully implement unid'd gear into all game modes, including fractals.
---
Well, Blizzard is a wee bit larger than Anet, their races are often just reskins (elves&gt;blood elves. goblins&gt;fox dudes, gnomes&gt;mechagnomes, etc.), and their story is overall kinda whatever and not some overarching plot involving your character particularly throughout the whole thing as GW2 does with the commander. 
---
Being that time personal story is already YEARS in the past, adding new bits to it would make things a bit odd, it would also mean adding new level 1-30 zones just for that race in whatever the new location is in order to help introduce them, but also somehow to move them... back in time... and into central tyria.  (Some races wouldn't be too hard to introduce but overall eh.)
---
Still, I would love a new race and all, however if I have to choose I'd much rather just get way more elite specs instead lol.
---
And ears clip through the helmets or hats a lot. -\_-;;; But yes, the feet drive me insane. I get so excited when I see the boots done properly instead of crammed into one human like boot or clipping through.
---
I'm astonished he got all of them, they've always had super obnoxious hitboxes for me.
---
I agree that season 3 is not great, but I think that says something at just how bad personal story is. I felt that the personal story was so bad, that I actually never finished it at launch when I was first leveling. It wasn't sometime around the wait for heart of thorns, that I was convinced to go back and finish it. I hated it because the writing was shit, the acting was just whatever, it was clearly rushed, the cut scenes were lousy, and they never properly fleshed any of the characters or stories out. It was so paper thin. Even *with* the instances and scale and length of the personal story, it was just so campy and bad. I felt it was self evident, but obviously everything I'm saying is a subjective reaction. In order to truly break down why, I felt the story of guild wars 2 was basically a joke until heart of thorns/season 3, I would need to sit down and write an entire essay, utilizing wooden potatoes' phenomenal let's play for sourcing (so I could analyze specific moments). However, it's late, so I'll try to do that later in the conversation when I have more time.
---
I think Heart of Thorns was the first point where I cared, but that was mostly due to the side stories and meta events and world building. Season 3 was the first story, where it felt like they actually had a direction and the narrative, while not great, was building with consistent characters. Each had glaring issues and flaws, though. Honestly, I'm in the weird position of defending both heart of thorns story and season 3 story, simply because it's contrasted to personal story.
---
Path of fire, however, THAT was when they legitimately hooked me into the story. Just my personal experience with it.
---
In addition to what other commenters have written about story, I think the number one reason for why blizzard can do this in wow while anet can't, is that in wow the majority of armor skins are either:
---
a) textures pulled over the character's body without any extra geometry whatsoever entering the equation
---
b) using [one of many predefined clothing geometries](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DP1gVY9aHwU/maxresdefault.jpg) that are actually embedded in the race's model (random example: thin bracers, thick bracers, bracers with chunky metal on the edges, pants, dress, pants with folded cloth at the ends, etc. Hundreds of skins can use the same set of geometry (actually called geoset) but with different textures
---
What this allows to do, is that once you've fitted all those couple of dozens geosets to the new race - you're done with retrofitting the vast majority of existing gear in the game. For the most part, it's just shoulderpads and helmets that have unique models, and those are usually just attached to respective bones on bodies and they don't require bending. In addition, wow has no body preset/size customization.
---
Contrast this to GW2, where every piece of equipment has a unique model, that needs to be manually fitted to every gender of every race and tested to minimize clipping with different body presets and size extremums.
---
Racial skills are easy to make. Racial stories aren't, but they should be manageable in a context of an expansion release (and they don't have to be on par with LS quality). But retrofitting hundreds of armor skins and outfits would be a nightmare. And it also essentially increase all the future skin modeling workload by 20%.
---
The amount of work that goes into making a playable character is increasing with each year, and it leaves me very sad about the prospects of seeing games in the future that allow us to play something beyond boring humans.
---
If only gw2 got dwarfs.
---
Henchmen still work, particularly at lower levels (which are deliberately not super hard). [This page](https://gwpvx.gamepedia.com/Build:Team_-_7_Hero_Beginner_Team) also has a hero build designed for people just starting, with instructions on which heroes to unlock / how to get them (quite a few can be gotten pretty early into the game).
---
Literally this. I have 16 characters - 1 human female, 1 norn female, 2 female sylvari, 1 male sylvari, and 1 female charr that I barely use but like the designs/characters, so I can't bring myself to delete them.
---
And then I have 10 asura mains. 9 of them are male and look physically identical because I just like the idea of the commander dabbling in every single class and I'm attached to the character design. I just love playing male asura characters, so help me.
---
(I also happen to love Steve Staley's (Male Asura VA) voice, so there's that. That man could read a phone book and I would listen to it. :P)
---
Remember Ascalon!
---
You seen how shitty old places look ? They don't update graphics for everything just for expansion content. WC3 has better tree models than WoW Kalimdoor.
---
new race in gw 2 ...... why? we can hope for new expansion in next few years at best.
---
I dont know anything about Archage Unchained but I did play a little of Archage and they are nothing alike. Archage is a basic cookie cutter MMO That felt very aged when it was new. They would have to make some huge overhauls to put it on the same level as GW2.
---
It’s basically a platform with a few fans in it. Extends your gaming laptops life considerably.
---
Depends how delta has them stored.  Meaning if you export them, it might not be easy to read or even in a way that makes much sense.  If they are all just IDs for skills, gear, traits, etc. then you'd be better off just copying them into gw2skills or something and waiting for Anet's version of templates at the end of the month.
---
In short though, no.  There's not currently a tool.  You could try and work something out with delta though.
---
I mean, 7 years in, if they arent at least making plans for GW3 then GW3 isnt going to be a thing. It will take them 3 or 4 years to complete that at the least. GW2 took them like 7 years. I hope if they do GW3 that they plan on using URE4 or Lumberyard or something other than the GW2 engine.
---
Am I reading that right? You have to gable 100G and a stack of ecto... a hundred times?
---
And people do this?
---
I know a lot about furries, I don't even hate them I think they're cool. My point was I think it's kinda fcked up to just say "hurray anet for not adding more dumb furries" when all they'd be doing is giving us another amazing race to play. Who cares if it's an animal? We'd be getting content
---
Sure showed me! /S
---
There is a chance to win 2000g. And you will get at least 25g and 50 Ectos back.
---
You're trying way to hard to defend furries over the internet
---
also, your posts are not as smart as you believe they are
---
haha
---
When is arcdps build templates shutting down?
---
It would be nice if there was a way to craft these super-rare items instead of my hit-list of 'forget about this' items getting longer and longer.
---
Make it a 500 recipe and accountbound-on-aquire and need a Legendary component if it has to but there's got to be a better way than this subterranean level of RNG drop rate.
---
The issue here is you're agreeing with them that furries are bad, it's not my thing but doesn't make it bad. Charr are still furry.
---
**I can give you some tips on Core, since I just finished maxing that out - you need 49 to finish everything (I recommend doing everything, even if you hate fractals, so you can go back to earning spirit shards every so much xp gained. Max Pact Commander first, auto-loot will change your life for the better.):**
---
9 points - grab all 9 of the mastery insight points in central Tyria, this is a mere half hour's work or less with mounts and a level 80 character (you don't need mounts, but it's faster).
---
8 points - Finish all 8 levels of your personal questline.
---
8 points - Finish all 8 Living World Season 2 episodes.
---
4 points - Take a weekend or two and camp the Triple Trouble event. If you get in about 20 minutes before the event on groupfinder with a guild that runs it regularly, you can knock this out easily in three runs for 4 mastery points (1 for each head, 1 for killing all three).
---
1 point - if you're taking the trouble to do Triple Trouble, there's an extra point for getting all 10 achievements done that is fairly easy to snag.
---
1 point - Kill Tequatl the Sunless (world boss event, jump on a map early in group finder on the weekend).
---
1 point - Master of Heroics. You get this automatically for having 1 character leveled to 80, which you want to do anyway to get the rest of these.
---
1 point - defeat the Queen Skritt in Dry Top, a weekend with a decently full map should net you this easily.
---
**At this point, you have 16 more points to get and some options depending on what you would rather do:**
---
If you prefer to grind fractals, then there are 14 points that can be gotten just by emoting, killing things, or avoiding damage, etc. fairly easily. There are several more that will take a lot of grinding to hit, but it's doable to pull all of the remaining 16 out of it.
---
If you prefer PVE and don't want to spend tons of gold, you will be doing some of the more tedious and annoying mastery points (i.e. grinding in Silverwastes until all 4 legendaries show up and you get a hit in, finding all the lost gold badges in the Silverwastes, doing the Sensor Scooter sidestory, jumping puzzles, etc.). One of the best ways to get some of these is to get literally every achievement for the LWS2 episodes, but those can be really tedious to grind out solo.
---
If you're willing to spend gold, you can skip some of the more annoying things. (i.e. doing the Emperor and Ascended Accoutrements achievements, but these get painfully expensive.)
---
**Here are the ones I did:**
---
5 points - Killed all four legendaries in the Silverwastes, with the fifth point for nailing all four.
---
1 point - did the Drydock Scratch jumping puzzle with the springer at lvl.3, gliding maxed, and a guide. Wasn't too bad.
---
1 point - went back to the above puzzle and snagged all 30 of the golden badges with a guide and the "show item names" box checked, which makes them MUCH more visible. This is much less annoying with gliding and the springer at lvl. 3, but not necessary (the whole thing was created before mounts existed).
---
1 point - kill the Karka Queen in Southsun Cove. This is decently easy with a good zerg on the weekends, but I've seen this successfully complete less often than Tequatl or the Queen Skritt so I stuck it down here.
---
1 point - Sensor Scooter sidestory. This is hellishly annoying at first, then when you get used to it, really easy. The dot is a very small yellow green that is hard to see until you're on top of it, but if the sensor reads green, pay attention to which way it's pointing. If it's in front of you, move forward a bit. If it's buried at your feet, go down, and so on. The critical thing is not to move around too much once you hit green on a sensor ping, that means they're super close. Ping every time the button refreshes. Spread it out so you don't get frustrated. It's annoying, but easily doable once you figure it out.
---
1 point - Emperor's New Wardrobe. This requires 1 full set of armor from each race at each level (1-3) and costs almost 645 gold. I would spread this out, pick the things you really like the look of, and don't try to do it all at once. Yes, this is slightly insane and I would recommend most people run all 8 dungeons once instead for an easy, cheap point. Yes, I really hate dungeons that much. Sue me.
---
1 point - the Hidden Garden jumping puzzle. I suck at jumping puzzles, but this was a lot less of a hassle than say, trying to unlock some of the rare collection ones (i.e. ambrite weapons).
---
**At this point, you need 5 more mastery points. I highly recommend just getting these from noob fractals, ask a guildmate to help you or post in LFG; I did these 5:**
---
1 point - holo-hornpipe with the Aetherblade dancers. Literally just doing the dance emote in front of the holograms mid-fractal.
---
1 point - Hop Skip and Jump - this can be harder, but you just have to avoid falling off the fractal when jumping up the broken bits at the beginning.
---
1 point - If only we had marshmallows achievement is lighting all the fires in the snowblind fractal. Newer groups or learning groups will probably do this anyway.
---
1 point - Take a bow - finish the Cliffside fractal and bow emote to the giant. Really easy.
---
1 point - Out of Cluck - kill all the chickens in the urban battleground fractal. Just complete the fractal, shove the return message to one side, split up and kill chickens. IIRC there are 5, it takes very little time.
---
**If you really, truly hate fractals and dungeons with a fiery burning passion, then you're going to be spending a lot of time/money to finish. There's no way around that, the above five achievements can be done easily in an afternoon with some luck and nice guildmates.**
---
I would recommend avoiding the other listed achievements in that category if possible; all of them are fairly grindy, expensive, and time consuming. There is one point you can pick up from completing all the Tequatl achievements, but if you suffer from lag at all, it's going to be super annoying to get done (you have to dodge 10 shockwaves and 1 tail swipe, which can be very hit or miss). Dive Master looks easy but has one heinously difficult dive that requires you to have pinpoint precision to not die. If you die, you have to redo the entire jumping puzzle to try again. Ambrite weapons take insane grinding, so do gold fractal weapons, etc. etc., for the love of your sanity if you want to max Core Tyria, be willing to splash into fractals a bit. I would still be trying to complete mine if I hadn't - it is DOABLE, but I don't recommend it.
---
Hope this helps!
---
I'm not agreeing that furries are bad. I like them. My argument is that *furries aren't bad, and using them to diss charr and any possible future races* just because they might be non human is silly, that's all.
---
I think it would be so lovely if we got another race. Especially one that isn't human looking like sylvari or norn because hell, there are so many games where you can play as a human. Having something "furry" would be cool but using "furry" to say that anet shouldn't add something is silly. Sorry if I wasn't clear the first time
---
Epic rebuttal
---
Don't worry, I never thought much of you to begin with since I happen to have enough sense to make up for the complete lack of it in you.
---
Here's gw2raidar global stats on raid bosses, so we can be spared of your vapid, mongoloid platitudes.
---
https://gw2raidar.com/global_stats
---
Power herald, nonexistant. Power reaper 24% behind the top two power specs.
---
Now please do fuck off somewhere else where other people don't have to be inflicted the pain of having to process your drivel while trying to glean something remotely useful on reddit.
---
Off to the mute list you go, see you never.
---
hmmm what did you say something
---
Considering most of the news wow races are the old races with different skin colour...
---
In an mmo gw2 probably has one of the best movement and action gameplay for pvp. Do you play with free camera and stuff?
---
Wow! Really lovely. I especially like the colour scheme. :)
---
I enter fractals with no less than A HUNDRED open spaces... 20 is nothing. I can’t imagine any activity in the game that won’t fill 20 spaces in no time.
---
The cheapest 20-slot bags are actually the uncommon gear fractal bags. If you replace all your bags with them, your inventory behaves like a regular one.
---
&gt;that’s probably my old character we’re killing
---
We're of killing one charr when this all goes down. We see the blast from our perch of 'victory'. Also, we don't die?
---
i had hoped over the years that delta and gw2skills or metabuild would cooperate and share the build codes
---
Where did you hear people got their display names changed? I’ve never known any game to do this.
---
Back in september of 2014:
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/a-fresh-start-the-new-player-experience-in-guild-wars-2/
---
Wow 5? Time to do it then. Ty for the info
---
Is that true about the golem?
---
Hum add arcDPS option or TacO directly in option ^^
---
It is mentioned in that post. The whole "my greatest fear" arc got completely removed in 2014. Thats either the apatia story with the krait orb, the story with demolitionist tonn or the orrian mesmer stuff. Also all of the final story chapters started in fort trinity at the airship and the cleansing of orr happpens at a different moment. Those were the biggest changes to the story.
---
Then howcome ALL of my characters (who were made in 2016-) except for this one played through it originally. The cleansing of Orr being right before Zhaitan, having to do the Apatia stuff, and actually going to Orr to access the instances were all things all my other character had to go through so like what?
---
Ehh consider yourself lucky GW2 doesn't even have a good story just get him to lvl 80 and do big events &amp; fractals.
---
*We like the story so....*
---
Oh god  
---
They told us about Alliances ahead of time as well  
---
It's gonna be terrible and you'll have to pay gems for a bigger alliance or something...
---
Because having them all load on one page is more convenient than opening tabs for each one
---
I wouldnt recommend anyone to start playing pvp at this point. 
---
It is dead, anything anet did to revive it was a fail. If you want to play pvp just go to mobas.
---
Warframe functions the same way but limits convenience to things like upgrading your gear faster or having more equipment in storage etc  
---
I never felt like my experience was kneecaped in the hopes I would spend more. It might cause a bottleneck for people who no life the game but a casual player rarely felt the need to pony up any more than would be reasonable for a totally free to play game.   
---
(One that has a much higher production quality I might add)  
---
Warframe would also have frequent daily discounts on game currency in large % amounts (remember once getting a 40% off coupon) which I can't remember Anet ever doing.
---
I took my most cancerous build condi mirage into wvw (BG) and I literally killed 3 high vet in the middle of hostile frog camps lol it took like 10 minutes but I won. 
---
Made me appreciate the circle in pvp, honestly.
---
It's smölhart! She has been reshapped by the power of CREATE NEW CHARACTER.

Now she's a necromancer! Huh? They did what to Scourge?

This is how she looked the last time we drew her, [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/arrwu9/small\_heart/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/arrwu9/small_heart/), things have really come a long way from 2019.

---
&gt;Don't.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Don't what?  
---
&gt;Don't give me hope.
---
&gt;Although this begs the question, will I have to buy separate upgrades per character like I do for bag slots?
---
That's the general understanding, yes.
---
NCsoft =/= Arenanet. Arenanet is a subsidiary of NCsoft, but NCsoft doesn't manage Arenanet day-to-day or fund them out of their own pocket.
---
Account names are tricky because of all the coding tied to them. I'm not familiar with the code of GW2, but devs have talked about how changing an account name can cause issues down the line and there's the very real, if small, possibility of the account being rendered unplayable. Not to mention issues of how other the database and other accounts interact with an account that had a name change.
---
It's easy to say that they need to make it easier, but the fact of the matter is there's over 7 years of code built around account names acting a certain way. Outside of an engine overhaul, Arenanet isn't likely to make it easy for people to change their account names.
---
If your current account name is causing distress and the initial GM isn't helpful, ask for the ticket to be escalated. I think account name changes can only be done by senior GMs anyway given how risky they are to do. I've known and heard from multiple people who got their account names changed for one reason or another and largely they've said that after asking for it to be escalated it goes far smoother than other companies. Your mileage may vary, of course, but Arenanet can and does do name changes provided your reasons are good and you're willing to accept the risks in it being changed. If you don't ask to be escalated, well, that's on you.
---
she got a shitstain on her panties
---
If this isn't related to disabling infusions I will eat a choya salad.
---
I agree that the tab system was not needed and they could've just had a he storage system to load them. They choose to go the tab way though, not sure why that is. But I'm certain it's for a reason other than just to monetize it. They've been working for 2 years or even longer on this, so it should be a known fact that they've thought this through and tested multiple things.

they prolly have your average package pc from Walmart so it aint surprising performance
---
Ah, the Tangled Depths.
---
It's bugged.
---
1. Use discipline instead of arms. Faster weapon swapping, movement speed and way more damage.
---
2. Put the boons fury and might into your build. they have a massive impact on your outgoing damage and will make you feel 100x stronger.
---
3. Use blocks, evades or invulns instead of defensive stats. Vitality and Toughness are extremely inefficient stat choices in PvE when you can just block 100% of a big hit.
---
What, it never happened to you?
---
In open world I'd actually recommend offhand shield instead of offhand mace. The cc difference is nominal but having an almost free long duration block is not.
---
I've been also trying to get into Albion Online recently, but due to lack of time I postponed it.
---
Thanks for The input! True about giving GW2 a chance - it could be really more successful playerbase wise and satisfying experience if extensive work was put to areas where this game is...mediocre at its best. But hey, we are getting builds feature soon! How dare I even say bad word about this game's development process.
---
I have the same opinion about BDO.
---
Too hardcore rng tied to progression, too p2w'ish IS and sad excuse of a PvE wrapped inside awesome combat.
---
Probably just build templates settings.
---
I love the owl :)
---
I'm getting similar vibes about gw2 from Your post. Surely i will try my own pace in Sandbox MMO, either AA or Albion which Im also looking at. :)
---
especially in the new fashion/infusion-wars meta
---
yeah we're doing fine in CN server.  you want to come and play in CN server? it's a amazing place
---
I'm not arguing about it as much as I'm relaying what ANet has already stated on the issue. I just don't think it's as unproblematic as you make it out to be.
---
I love this and hope I can find the artist someday for something similar for my character of choice!
---
Oh okay thanks !
---
wait, you have a full ascended set of soldier gear? I'd suggest you to stat swap it:  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat\_changing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing) 
---
The insignias (for armor) cost about 7g each; the inscriptions (for weapons) cost \~3g on TP.
---
If you have trouble surviving, I suggest a spellbreaker build: [http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PKwAEd7lJwGZYsEGKOWX+vaA-zRIYhSIo6/UCTEEoEoCFQLDBVMA-e](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PKwAEd7lJwGZYsEGKOWX+vaA-zRIYhSIo6/UCTEEoEoCFQLDBVMA-e)
---
Altenrative, if you don't have spellbreaker unlocked: Core Power Warrior [http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PKwAEd7lJwGZYsEGKOWP1LfA-zRIYhSIo6/UCTEEoEoCFQLDBVMA-e](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PKwAEd7lJwGZYsEGKOWP1LfA-zRIYhSIo6/UCTEEoEoCFQLDBVMA-e)
---
I tried to use as much of the gear you already have, but stat swapping it to berserker. The torch is not that good of a power DPS weapon, that's why I scrapped it for a shield (more defense).
---
\-----------------
---
Most of your passive heal sustain comes from the healing provided by getting might. That's why the sigil on the greatsword is very helpfull, to improve this passive HP generation even more. Also mind: If you're stuck in a lot of small hits, using "block" from the shield will also heal you, because of the might generation while blocking.
---
The spellbreaker build offers more active defense through the full counter abillity, the core warrior build on the other hand has even more passive HP regen (when hitting with a burst skill you get more HP regen) and a very helpfull 2500 HP heal + 1000 toughness for 8s whenever you break out of a hard CC.
---
While these builds are very durable, they also hit hard as heck. If you want more DPS and don't need the defense of the shield, then go for dual axe (or spellbreaker got a great alternate Axe-dagger / dagger-axe build)
---

Yeah what exactly is this "trade off" that DH has that made it fair for chronos to have clunky shatters and druids to have nerfed pets?
---
I posted the exact same photo but got downvoted to hell.. Reddit.

Yeah thats what ive been doing
---
Sure, here's a fun variation I came up with focusing a little more on burning damage: http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PGhAwilZwkYPMPmJOqK7vdA-zRZYBRTUFMbYlRCFQEJgyDA-e
---
Can swap traits for condition removal on fire tree if needed and gain stability on stances on weaver tree if you're facing a lot of cc. The base build is for max dps and speed, I started with berserker gear and celestial trinkets, more focused on power. If you're clearing trash, than the power way with power runes and power sigils is the fastest way. I also put in weaver rune set on this build for extra barrier generation if you want it to be even more tanky. 
---
For soloing tougher content, the grieving/burning hybrid should be stronger over time, as is ussual for condi builds, but the nice thing is this is not a pure condi build but can still reach 90% burning duration without any viper gear, I just used the grieving armor pieces I had lying around from pof chests and it seems to fit pretty well. The rune sets you can pick according to your own taste, there's plenty of them that are viable. 
---
But the base tankiness from the weaver comes from the skills themselves. All the iframes, vigor buffs, barrier generation, selfheal from the passive, strong iframe disengage with heal on water 2, teleport engage back with air 2 stun, aoe cc from earth 3, earth 4, air 5... There's just so much mobility and cc availble you can just dance around your foes while they burn away from your opener, this playstyle can really be a lot of fun. 
---
So you don't really need the protective gear, could do it with any gear when mastered. I just had tons of unused trinkets I got from fractals lying around and put them on this char and that's how the build came to be and I slowly evolved it over time. Could put viper trinkets on it to make it even better dps, but I don't have any spares so it really depends on what you have availble, can make it work with anything really as long as you play it right, and many parts of the build and gear are adjustable.
---
If you see chaotic signs please report to your local Inquisition representative, he'll be more than happy to help you with that
---
How do you dodge infinitely on mirage?
---
I'm new on mesmer running Staff/Staff + Infinite Horizon + 2 Sigil of Energy and just checked if there is any specialization that could make me regenerate enough endurance to dodge infinitely, but I don't get it.
---
Do you have Logging &gt; "Lock target to encounter NPC" activated?
---
That one ye.
---
Hahah indeed! I can see the posters already for that. 
---
[Contact "555-Choasfear" to speak to a sales representative. ]
---
if by the "site" you mean arcdps, no, the most it can do is once the new build goes live allow to covert the stored build templates on arcdps to the format anet decides to use, but that would only be able to cover the build part, not the equipment part, which is the part that causes more problems to people. 
---
Maybe it could allow to somehow "export" the builds in txt or csv format so that people can have that as reference, but i don't expect it to happen.
---
That's a reminder that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
---
Since they announced you'll be able to use hotkeys to switch between the sets, GW2 Radial will likely add a new menu just for build swaps. Since all it does is enter the key combo for you when you click a popup button.
---
and afaik gw2radial is still green lit for use ingame.
---
Have you enabled the option before going into combat? It fixed the issue for a couple of friends
---
Have been doing the strike mission daily, sometimes more than once and they havent dropped for me.
---
Yes. And the most reliable source here, because of agony.
---
Just please be something that makes me want to use anet templates.
---
If this is disabling infusions, I will buy mistlock pass!
---
How long did you *not* have access to your account?
---
Could it be the case that your account got hijacked and whoever did it deleted your characters, so this could be "wrong"? In that case, have you tried the reset with an empty character name?
---
Still waiting
---
PoE does this for free, just email the support and in a couple of min someone will message you to log out if you are ingame, so he can change your account name.
---
Smoothly, i believe no team had any issue with being stuck in a game or stuffs like that.

Hi, i would like to know how many time for balance on thief pvp ? ( He is overcheat with poison and sword.... ) running traits from daredevil ( impaling lotuis and all conditions traits.. ) This class have too much winrate now for sure.
---
What offended you in my post?
---
It's less about a better pipeline, and more about WoW being old. When WoW was being developed, having a unique model for every piece of clothing would blow the RAM up (minimum requirement for WoW on launch was a measly 256 MB), not even mentioning the performance: I'm lagging in GW2 raids with just 10 players around, WoW had to accommodate 40 (80 in AV).
---
Don't expect too much, Kas and Jory aren't very deep characters unfortunately.
---
I do remember my character name.
---
And I already made a support ticket 10 days ago, no reaction. So I was hoping that maybe someone here knows this problem.
---
If they kept the serious approach and kept the sitcom occasional, it would have been perfect.
---
what's your IG so I can repost this and tag you?
---
WOW, THAT'S QUALITY BACKGROUND
---
All you can do is wait, getting a new password can take times depending on how much info you provided
---
Not really the place to ask this since this is mostly a thread where players ask other players questions and we don't really have more info than you might have about the content and date of a future balance patch. Although since a patch was just released the next one may probably not hit that soon.
---
Mike Z is game director. I doubt he's going to pick up the president role of Mike O. He doesn't have any experience running a company.
---
All good points but doesn't address the biggest issue that made me quit PvP.
---
I started seriously doing PvP in Season 3 for Ascension. Hit Diamond tier in Season 4, completed Ascension early in Season 5 and noped out of the entire game mode because the changes they implemented such as the placement matches to determine your starting tier that apparently threw the matchmaking completely out of whack.
---
I starting getting 9 match losing streaks and 4-5 match winning streaks. When you lose 9 straight matches on a regular basis (sometimes through no fault of yours), it starts to wear you down.
---
I'm glad for that 1.5 seasons of PvP I took to get Ascension. It was fun but I don't expect to be going back until there's something drastic done with ending streaky matchmaking.
---
&gt; It’s because the players playing are usually in their own instances of content
---
It's also because the game is incredibly dead
---
\*sight\* Yeah, but I provided all the info there is. Account name, Character name, game key, email address.  
---
With support being this slow, I might as well just leave guild wars be.
---
What are you on? 150 relics is jack shit.
---
I see, that makes sense.
---
obviously i can't stop you but i would greatly prefer if you didn't repost my work
---
No problem. I'll respect what you want.
---
True. GW2 is a f2p game, you get what you pay for.
---
You cannot.  Gotta be 80 before unlocking elite specs.
---
Only the basegame is f2p.
---
Sword/Dagger Weaver is awesome, you hit like a truck with just enough defensive abilities to *maybe* stay alive if you mess up.  I'd say that out of my current builds, Weaver is tied with my Thief for most high risk, high damage build.
---
Be aware of that your account might be terminated for good if the key have a charge back. You might think that this wont happen to you, but consider how many posts there are here on reddit from players who also thought it would never happen to them and they got their accounts terminated and they have to buy new expacs i would ask you to seriously consider a supported retailer.
---
TRION simply got greedy with the cash store and made it massively pay to win
---
they both look casual to me
---
With all the talk about gw2 build templates &amp; Delta ceasing development on arc templates, has there been any mention of change to the in game DPS meter? Or if Delta plans to keep supporting his current DPS meter?
---
They probably don´t tell you what field is wrong so that others cant go by try and error
---
So what you are saying is we're all fucked?
---
I initially liked everything melee, so my first pick and the character I spent ~300 days on was a power d/d thief. I didn’t really care bout meta and stuff and it was a pure joy, especially transitioning into HoT maps and further beyond w/o any toughness and roughly 10k hp. Maybe a little masochistic but it taught me alot and made overall gameplay more souls-like
---
It is if I'm not mistaken. However, if you're scammed, it's tough luck
---
and it's entertaining to watch
---
Don't my word as proof but I remember seeing some comments saying that it is OK because they are both their games, assuming both items (in GW1 and GW2) have been obtained in a legit way. Would have to try and remember where it was posted if I can.
---
Or if you need it to be online, go twitter
---
As they did with all their games and destroyed RIFT by doing so together with their f2p version which shows that there is a right way to make f2p and a wrong way. Archage might surive due to loosing TRION, but then again Gamigo, i dunno, i hope for the best but will wait and see :)
---
You're going to be an alcoholic.
---
I am making friends the improper way
---
I think I just fell in love. Forever.
---
Why would you mount an unique npc?
---
Utterly stunning
---
Yes, weaver is pretty glassy, you'll need to actively use damage mitigation skills to stay alive.
---
You need to be max level before using elite specs like weaver.
---
On your way to 80, you should be using all the weapons at your disposal, to learn how elementalist works, what it is and isn't capable of, and how all your traits tie together and synchronise. This will make you a better weaver, and player in general. This is true of all professions.
---
I recentely got the matching outfit for this jackal skin with a recovered lion goods thingy.
---
And omg it's perfect.
---
I wish they could do the same for most of the Lounge passes... I hate the peachy sound from the Asuran portal on the Royal Terrace.
---
well sound for me like a standard gemshop item, that has to randomly be acquired before you are able to buy it. whats the point of it? and how would that fit into gw2?
---
having a 0.1% chance to drop a new mount skin from a champion bag and then you can buy it for 2k gems or what?
---
How about kiosks would start to sell apples instead of cigarettes?
---
Ppl with gambling addiction shouldn't play video games at all.
---
Nice healing orbs you have there. Would be a shame if something were to happen to them.
---
Omg, you're a Pro!
---
Thanks for the info.
---
I'll try a build like that. Still fresh on pvp, so I'm using meta build before experimenting.
---
Awww look it can copy the adults.
---
Keep trying, you'll get there soon!
---
This is some low quality bait.
---
The gemshop removes the random component (blueprint acquisition) which is healthier in my opinion. Rocket league could learn a thing or two.
---
Feel free to ask.
---
I gave someone gw1 minis and ecto and stuff ages ago.  
---
That person gave me a weapon skin or two as they didn't want them for free.
---
I personally don't think I broke any ToS.
---
I wanted to give them all the remaining stuff on my account for free, nothing wrong with that, regardless what I get sent in gw2
---
Yeah. I just spend the 20 euros to get it at day one 😂😂😂
---
It's all about templates. No changes to dps meters(in game, or arcdps) has been mentioned by either deltaconnected or ANet.
---
The reward security is the statues. You can get the desired item later.
---
It's going to be disappointment no matter what it is.
---
Silky smooth experience. GW2 on PS4 confirmed?
---
But, people will tell you PvP and WvW are competitive, and not dependent on brain dead OP gimmick builds because you can't see stuff to react anyway. 
---
These people are wrong. 
---
Last patch pretty much cemented me giving up on WvW/PvP. I'll come around for LS5 and never buy gems again.
---
So your issue is you don't go into fractals with 4 out of 5 of your bags empty. With 5 bank tabs filled and two mules it sounds like you have ample junk to get rid of.
---
That is an interesting idea but I would have some points that I don't think would have a big impact when such a system would be translated to GW2.
---
From the link, you provided, it is stated that whenever you play a match you have a chance to obtain a random Blueprint which you then can pay money for, to obtain the item.
---
This in itself looks weird to me because for anyone who joins the game after this change or didn't knew/care about it would then get the blueprint and then ask themselves why they would need to pay something that they got in-game! A lot of players already complain about "cut content" and I don't think this situation would be any different because without knowing the previous system it would really seem like you get loot that you then have to pay for to unlock.
---
AFAIK those crates are also only for yourself and can't be traded?! If that is the case, many things from the Black lion chest can be traded and even sold to other players. This would mean that the price would instantly drop to the price you pay for with real-world money.
---
As I said above and as stated in the link, you have a chance to get them after each match but how would you distribute them in GW2? After each PvP match would make sense, in WvW would be a bit tricky because every tick (5m) would be a bit much and could lead to players farming them. In PvE this would be even worse because there is not really a consistent thing do get them, Events would need a very low "drop" chance, Hearts and Map completion are not something you do repeatedly.
---
It is a really interesting Idea, but I don't think it works that well in GW2 as it will in Rocket League.
---

---
In pvp and wvw reveal is an upgrade over poison. In pve it was always a terrible skill linked to another full support skill, when pve has almost never need for this type of support (pulsing aoe cleanse). 
---
I understand wanting scrapper to be better in pve, but this does update its function in wvw and pvp without affecting it in pve in a MEANINGFUL WAY. Instead we have carebears crying about how a situational skill was changed into another situational skill, mostly because they're genuinely too dumb to realise how bad chemical field actually was.
---
And as always when discussing with pve monkeys oblivious to efficiency yet entitled to balance opinions, the actual pve offsets anet added (obviously not enough) don't help and arent a way to go, as per the comic. They more than offset the loss of chemical field, but what about the RP value?
---
Monkeys here, monkeys there, chemical field has been irrelevant in pve since 2013 so why do they care? Pinpoint actual issues with the class and not this BS. Why cry over losing an entirely irrelevant skill you shouldn't ever use? Anet why did you change the worst skill on my bar, Reeeeeeeee.
---
Is this in game!

This is drop dead gorgeous. You have amazing skill, my friend. =]

ArcheAge has jiggling boobs and the [succubus outfit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXlKIH_kwGk). How can GW2 beat that?
---
Because no pic is provided.

Lol sounds like someone is terrible at PvP
---
That would actually be a great thing.
---
Congrats for the wedding and amazing guildmates!! Also, obligatory GW2 jokes:
---
* inb4 this is salvaged for mats to be sold on the TP
---
* Does this come with an overpriced infusion?
---
lmao, why are you fixated to determine a class worth's through raids, be it benchmarks or logs. And you want balance to be done exclusively towards making X better at that in particular, it's hilarious.
---
I was saving the name with my comment XD
---
I absolutely love the ArcheAge world, but when I realized the amount of grind involved, I quit. Interested to see what the relaunch is right, because for a game I played such a short amount of time, I still think about ArcheAge a lot.
---
I know right. What I'd do for ping that low.
---
Luckily I had a Black Lion Key held for "big events" XD I used it and found the skin \* \^ \* I was really too lucky that sometimes I'm ashamed to tell it   e.e
---
Submit your ticket under payment issues category. Support will answer in under 24hours. I commit all my tickets like that because everything else takes at least 2 weeks
---
&gt; In gw2 for same system to be implemented, probably easiest to bind it to reward tracks. both pvp and wvw have quite balanced reward track progress gain, and in pve each map has own reward track progressed by doing events.
---
interesting idea, but having a "chance" on a blueprint after completing a reward track doesn't really sit right with me. They take long especially if you used up all of your potions which you can only get so many per day.
---
And then the question still stands how you would implement an equally "long" system in PvE.
---
What is the general opinion surrounding the Endless Ocean Skins? I have a claim ticket but not sure if people like the skins or not (Im pretty indifferent just looking to maybe get some easy gold). Does anyone have their finger on the pulse of this type of thing and would know if they are popular or not?
---
It is nice to have a more accessible forward leap on sword for engaging, but now the roll dodge is behind that skill. A plus and a minus.
---
The greatsword change makes the block more useful I think, but greatsword throwing was one of my favorite things to do as ranger. :&lt;

That’s just the domain of anguish.

You only use legendary insights for the pre-cursor set of the legendary armor set. Ascended crafting requires only that you have maxed out your crafting track and are able to acquire the needed materials through looting or buying off npcs. see wiki link provided by rum_burak. Do note, if you loot ascended gear but its not the right insignia. there's a recipe to change the stats here: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing
---
where does the chaos symbol come from?
---
yes, you do. If you don't, you should.
---
Its raid thing isnt it? Then now mate, sorry.
---
They do, but since they are constantly stoned, they don't get out much.
---
if only you could get more keys like the weekly lvl 10 story quest key. random drops from map completion are not reliable... 
---
I am okay with lootboxes, if there is a f2p way to get some yourelf.
---
I needed 120 keys to get the dwayna glider back then, 90 keys for the Hydra Staff.. 
---
If i would get like 5-10 keys a week just from playing, maybe put keys in they login rewards or key fragments u get from every meta event or smth. so that it feels like a bonus and not like a "i lose a lot when i gamble" ppl who pay can fasten the progress..
---
I've run across my fair share of fowl people who play this game.
---
Renderer settings, DX10-11-12. :P
---
Nobody says that it has to be whole reward track. You can get it every 25% similarly how transmutation charges are.
---
PvE reward tracks are equally long.
---
That is legendary gear, not ascended.
---
If you have The Moot III: The Energizer collection unlocked, you can craft all the way to 500, easiest one is the [Mashed Purple Potatoes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mashed_Purple_Potatoes)
---
What I was thinking about was more about the way to farm it, the easier it is to obtain the more blueprints you would get since I don't think it would be such a good idea to only give a chance on something in a reward track.
---
Let's say £300ish. I know gaming pc's ain't cheap, but guild wars 2 is 7 years old.
---
When updating my pc, I managed to run gw2 on a single gtx970 and it ran fine so, 970s sell for like £70ish and gpus tend to be the most expensive part so I'm thinking I can build it farely cheap.
---
No, the envoy set is raid exclusive. But that's not the only way to make ascended armor :)
---
Playing core guardian in open world right now. Personally, I love it. Set up with Zeal, Radiance, and Virtues is a nice way to go.
---
You've mistaken legendary raid armor with ascended. Make sure you know what's you are doing, because if if crafted things for lege armor then.... Well. You guessed it.
---
That would be GamesWorkshop's Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer Fantasy :) 
---
Though I think it's universally accepted as a symbol representing chaos. But don't quote me on that.
---
One (or more?) of the precursor stages are ascended, I think he's trying to make that.
---
If it looks like a duck, quack like a duck...
---
What? It's supposed to be right before the Searing, hence the unscathed ground.
---
It says so on  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Urban\_Battleground\_Fractal](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Urban_Battleground_Fractal)  at least.
---
Wait till after the Chistmas/new years holidays.
---
For a couple weeks after New years sites like New egg and others have massive sales on parts and you can get stuff 50-75% or more off.
---
Also when it comes to your power supply &amp; motherboard don't be afraid to get something much better then what you need.
---
I got mine 12 years ago and since I did that I have been able to upgrade twice while reusing them.
---
Idk if this is extreme desperation from a fanboy or extreme stupidity.
---
How will Unchained's release do ANYTHING for GW2 when WoW Classic came out and all ArenaNet did is dig their hole deeper and FFXIV is getting its first big patch, with the Nier Automata raid, at the end of October?
---
Path of fire includes Heart of thorns automatically so as soon as you apply the code to your account you have both (your account should also show this as well on the account.arena.net website).
---
There's always time to make a Strike mission against the felled dragon, and finally get the last battle we are missing.
---
A man of good taste
---
i got this chair for my asura.
---
Aaaah I see so if I want ascende gear I should open on lvl80, ty
---
I'd suggest deadeye thief.
---
Glassy, brain dead easy rotation with insane dps and if the shit hits the fan you can always just stealth to hide or run away.
---
Nice! I love that artist's work
---
Not silly with the build template update
---
Adorable, love me some artwork.
---
....well shit. It really reminded me of Ascalon City when I first played it and I just kinda assumed it was, but now I need to go back and play it to be sure.
---
But is he HoT?
---
Wow when did intel become so overpriced?
---
I've *played* AA.  You are constantly moving around in *any PvP game* because that usually means you are dead, though in AA that does vary with class as they still have some classes with channeled casting while in GW2 movement does not interrupt casting.  Both games make use of gliders, though GW2 also has more aggressive mounts as well.  GW2 also has the dodge system, of which anything similar is going to be extremely class/build specific in Archage.
---
I don't think AA is *slow*, and it certainly has faster ttk, but it's not as fast movement wise as GW2 is.
---
Unless he's outright lying the base mechanics are what I have a problem with. It's not a gradient issue. I don't want world PvP, contestants resources or +1 gear grinds
---
What do you mean?
---
Bloodstone is easy enough to get. If that's the only reason you'd open the bags on lvl 80, don't.
---
Half right. His corpse was to be in Arah explorable. But the while "enter the mouth" was pure player speculation from the 2010 teaser trailer that showcased the original corpse long before we found out that was Zhaitan'd corpse.
---
Probably not enough to matter. Play what you enjoy more.
---
Ah thanks, notes.
---
What sort of motherboard would you recommend?
---
It was always there.
---
There's no easter egg.
---
Maybe missed a pure speculation video on it.
---
ArcheAge went from trion to gamigo with Unchained rerelease. Quality companies lol. It's like what, 3rd fresh start this game wants to make? I'd say situation is transparent.
---
I would agree.
---
&gt; WC3 has better tree models than WoW Kalimdoor.
---
Keep telling yourself that. Maybe someday it will become true.
---
in pvp, regarding the leaderboard: why do I have decay (-70) and am still on the leaderboard on the same rank as before the decay with the same amount of points?  I have played 200 games so enough for the season
---
I thought decay affects leaderboard rank. I would not be on the leaderboard anymore with my decay affected points
---
Congrats!
---
I got one chest from strike mission couple weeks ago. It was from first 3/3 chest worthy kill.
---
Ditto. It's much faster on this laptop than it was on my old one but dear god it can get really laggy on there sometimes.
---
When they dominated AMD for the longest time.  Recently the Ryzen series chips started to make AMD worth a damn, but until that, AMD was garbage.
---
Oh I know, I'm not saying he can craft them. I'm just saying envoy is not necessarily legendary. I think OP is trying to craft precursor armor thinking that that's the way to get ascended armor.
---
&gt; And also male norn is just reskinned flesh golem
---
Wait, what are you talking about? Norn is it's own model and rig.
---
Depending on the stats you need, straight AR infusions can be outright better than the 9+5s.
---
A +13 is straight out better than a 9+5 precision, toughness or concentration, for example.
---
Can someone explain how this work "  edit: you can also work on all those achievement skins for Aurora and Vision without having to do all those tedious achievements, "
---
T4s would be fine I'm sure, but I think trying to pug CMs on anything but a warrior would definitely be "inconvenient".
---
Well I will let you know bc I am def going to make an export app and convert app
---
this way I will be able to make a convert for gw2skills to the new build template system
---
it is slow going but i will get it before real build templates exist
---
Their constant attempts at fixing balance issues only creates more problems and ruins the mechanics and fun of my favorite classes. This is EXACTLY why I am not playing at the moment.
---
Reminds me of [Maklain the Minstrel](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Maklain_the_Minstrel) who plays [this](https://youtu.be/SdSU_4d7XaE)
---
Full zerk sword/dagger weaver is one of the best, fluidiest and funniest to play in end-game content, the rotation just keeps going without breaks making weaver one of the top DPSes in raid squads and fractal groups. Rotation is quite flexible too: At short-phase bosses you can go quickly back in air-air (fresh air build) to reset rotation. It needs quick fingers! After learning the rotation perfectly it is very rewarding and satisfying.
---
One minus side is weaver don't have much CC and it can't buff/shield/reflect other players, it is pure DPS build.
---
For leveling go dagger/dagger until 80.
---
It's another strange fallacy that "action combat" requires you to aim something.
---
You can make ascended armor with a free account. Be aware though that only Core stat combinations are available. To be able to get every kind of stat you have to buy the game.
---
You can even make a lot of legendary equipment with free accounts but you have to go using the pvp or the WvW routes. You can also get the 1st generation legendary set with a free account although i'm not sure if some restrictions might complicate things for you when trying to purchase things on TP to ease the process.
---
What you cannot do with a free account:
---
- Get the PVE Raid armor: You need access to raids for this, and that's only for paying accounts.
---
- 2nd set of Legendary weapons: They are tied to paying content too.
---
- Legendary trickets: Same thing applies here (except for the backpacks, you can get all 3 with a free account).
---
I play pvp *very* casually, and I'm not a hardcore player in any mode.  Mainly do pvp just for a change of pace, and for rewards.  I find that pvp can become pretty confidence crushing and frustrating pretty quickly.  If you're not playing exactly the right class for that match, team composition, etc it can be very challenging to stay alive long enough to hit anything.  And playing for an hour or two and losing every match doesn't exactly make people want to play pvp more!
---
I'm not invested enough in GW2, never mind pvp specifically, to learn enough about every class and build to know how my opponents will play, predict their actions, and counter them.  As for figuring out CD times for opponents, I'm too busy trying not to die to do that!  Any game requiring that much time and effort to play is no longer a game, it's work.  But for me, the most frustrating things in a match are A) when someone doesn't play using the mechanics of the map after being told what they are and just does whatever they want, and B) when people just give up and AFK in the middle of a game because we're X points behind.
---
He used to be louder.
---
Disable instrument volume?
---
It's used as a genderless pronoun. It really doesn't make sense but it's how it is.
---
It took me way too long to see where the head was.
---
Depends on your mastery of the class and knowledge of the fractal, especially in a DPS slot because the few mechanics that are a dps check are super low. You won't be pulling 28k but most pugs dont regardless.
---
How difficult is it to get ascended accessories in LS3? I’m needing it and I’m wondering if I should buy ls3 or just get started farming fractals.
---
&gt;Current map planning would be fine if events dynamically changed its structure within the zone, like "centaurs raiding not the same village for 1000th time while" kind of stuff... you get the point :P
---
But on majority of MMos hundreds of mobs are packed together at random places of the map waiting to be killed and nothing else.
---
In this case I kind of prefer GW2 way of doing things. The map look like an actual map, instead of just a killing zone divided by levels.
---
Maybe, but pug groups aren't going to know if you're good or not. I certainly wouldn't be happy to take a core DPS class if I were pugging CMs.
---
Looks like you skipped 3 quests. Weird bug
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Story_Journal#Levels_70-80
---
You're gonna struggle on that budget unless you:
---
1. Wait for the biggest deals ever
---
2. Buy parts secondhand
---
You're not simply buying the GPU and CPU. Take into account RAM, the case, and hard drives. Plus peripherals and a monitor if you've been using a laptop prior to it.
---
I've played the game mate, and it's not really that fast.  You can move pretty quick with buffs like Shadowstep... but then you are pretty much in the same territory and swiftness/superspeed from GW2.  Plus most of the notable speed increased have rather long cooldowns so for the most part the only real speed buffs you can keep going indefinitely are from a songcraft spec in your group, aside from running certain equipment pieces/buffs (which again, falls into the same territory as GW2.
---
This is of course assuming an in-combat scenario.  Out of combat movement it's not even close because that brings GW2's mounts into the equation.

---
Nice
---
I mean, sword/dagger weaver is currently the highest DPS build, so you'll be fine there.  I actually just made an ele to do the same, but it's a steep learning curve for all the skills.
---
The water is amazing full of texture and  weight. nicely done!
---
Pumpkin head helm and new weapons? Sweet &lt;3
---
You don't see weavers in fractals because they are hard to learn, and people would rather use braindead DPS classes like DH.
---
&gt;"action combat" requires you to aim something.
---
.......yes, that's the reason why it's "action combat". Not really action if you literally can't miss cause everything is targeted for you.
---
Finally my pumpkin head!
---
**Time to get spooky**
---
Don't want to sound negative, but, all the same stuff again?
---
If you're going to play fractals , roll a warrior and if you see " BS " in lfg - they are talking about you , so join .
---
Gonna take a hard pass on the recycled content this year, but I’m hyped for the Episode one release after that!
---
Probably an outfit by the look of the rest of the armor
---
Oh hey new stuff
---
I don't know...  I need to  research more of the evils of the Ascalonians because at the moment... the Charr are the ones that seem like savages.  but i will call it ignorance on my part.
---
Don't forget some probably new skins, maybe mounts and an outfit!
---
That's why you start like most people do, by pugging on days that 99/100 show up and by posting your own practice group or by joining a guild. I would absolutely not turn down a core dps class with 450 ess and LNHB title because that guy knows his shit, I dont think many people at all would turn that down.
---
Nop, the rest of the armor are already armor skins.
---
Nope it's the [lunatic armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lunatic_Templar_armor), it was introduced in 2017.
---
That armour skin has been around for a bit now, it’s not an outfit
---
That's armor that's [already in the game](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lunatic_Templar_armor), so it's definitely a helm
---
The rest of the armour is already in the game though?
---
Well one its new for new players and two we don't know what contents in it.
---
Meh
---
Sadly the head is not burning, but nontherless a cool hat
---
Finally what I need to finish my Mad Queen look!!!!
---
So, looking at the trailer... nothing new.
---
Probably just new item rewards.
---
I still miss the Blood Prince mission we had years ago, dunno why that can't be recycled too at least. Make a Strike Mission of it!
---
Oooo looks like the Ascalonian Catacombs (dungeon) weapon models have been recycled. IMO the AC weapon collection is one of the best in the game, so I'm super interested to see where this goes.
---
What new fire infusion we getting? xD
---
Paper box helmet never come, sigh.
---
Seems like we finally getting big boi pumpkin as guild decoration. Finally.
---
Is that asura doing the jump puzzle in glowing orange underwear?
---
Asura, they spread all over my character select screen like tribbles. If you dont know what those are.... are you truly asura?
---
I use both depending on the enemy group, lb just makes for better clips. Staff is better against groups with good reflect uptime while longbow requires some finesse to work well, so for the average user staff will get better results
---
Nice to be able to mix with other armour pieces instead of the outfit.
---
http://prntscr.com/pgjisn looks like a jester
---
IIRC, GW1's Catacombs had many exits. And in GW2 there *is* an entrance  to catacombs (though blocked off) at [Abbey Ruins](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Abbey_Ruins).

---
Ah, the Jewel of Istan.
---
That's truly nobody's fault but the developers who made it that way. A "game" should be really about having fun not making it a part-time job. I really enjoy my necromancer not because it's "hard to learn" or "brain dead easy" but because it suits my playstyle and gets the job done. That should be the case with sword-weavers unfortunately looks like it requires a high IQ/learning curve for some players which is a letdown. My 12-yr old uses a staff weaver because she "dies to much" with a sword. I don't blame her - the class is really lacking.
---
Such a cool thematic event (especially in my corner of the world where we aren't over-saturated with Halloween stuff because it's not really a thing here). 
---
But such a shame they have pretty much left it in park for five years now or however much, instead of adding new things like they did the first couple of years.
---
BLTC Expectation vs. Reality
---
After the Charr Chair, I think we've all learned not to read too much into the promotional art in the gem store.
---
Bug Fix:
---
Updated the Gem Store banner for the Etherbound's Pauldrons.
---
that why i said "or it breaks"
---
Thanks for the encouragement! :D I think I'll go for it :)
---
Next raid is going to be set at the gates of the innermost sanctum of the Durmand Priory, you have to defeat a [giant oversized clown](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/if-the-emperor-had-a-texttospeech-device/images/7/70/Cegorach_Fullbody.png/revision/latest?cb=20170817170732) to get in.
---
Unless you have a library card that is, then you can just enter normally.
---
I can't be bothered with efficient farming either. I get the home nodes and every few days farm 5 minutes of bloodstone fen. Right now my routine is bitterfrost every few days included.
---
maybe they're right and their death can be attributed to the team's performance? even in high kp cm fractals you meet horribly bad players
---
either way, OP asked for a fragile big dps build which is sword weaver..they didn't ask for a passive defense low damage reaper
---
speaking of that..it's super disingenuous to claim weaver has low dps just because some people suck and can't play it properly
---
[This is face number 2 modified with sliders](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Charr_male_faces.jpg), [hair is number 4](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Charr-male-hairstyles-front.jpg) and [horns are obviously number 1](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Charr_male_horns.jpg). Things get tweaked up by concept artist all the time, don't look too much into it
---
Am I the only one who's glad it's not in the game? Feels like the final step in selling out for money with 0 consideration for immersion and whatnot. I know they pretty much don't care about that anyways but paper bag helmet is on another level.
---
Based off the menu being under some UI settings, maybe a hopeful chance for being able to finally disable animations and effects from friendly players?  Would help the game immensely considering how much content in this game is primarily zerg content, you could actually see whats happening.
---
Judging by the shield, we might get a fiery-themed Ascalonian-Catacombs reskin ;)
---
In Bitterfrost Frontier super easy. E3 A Crack in the Ice
---
Another year, time to hope that clocktower rewards get a tweak and to get disappointed again.
---
Looks like they reskinned the Royal Ascalonian weapon set and added flame particles to it. 
---
Looks great, I wonder if it will have a day/night cycle like the original set or if they are permanently on fire.
---
The only vague infos we have are
---
* they were considering setting the price of the gear template in the general idea of bag expansion/bank tab because it gives you effectively more storage space
---
* character and account build templates will be sold by packs of 3
---
Not being able to play an elite spec. Apart from maybe core warrior in tolerant groups, you won't like the lfg.
---
I really can't grasp how folks don't understand MMO festivals. Most of them include largely repeated content with (maybe) a few new rewards every year. 
---
The point of them is to celebrate a time of year out of game by having something *in* game, and as a way to break up the blank spaces in between content patches.
---
litterally every spec you mentioned isn't avaliable to him.
---
You would still need to do the work though.
---
With Gw2skills you would do it now and wait for it to update by creating the template code which you then can load in-game...
---
At the same time, you can clean up all the templates you don't actually use or are outdated.
---
That is nice
---
Inb4 it's an outfit and locked behind rng
---
Ahh the realm if torment
---
This is the right answer, I distinctly remember using mine almost a year after upgrading.
---
But maybe swimsuit outfit?
---
I get you with the horns and face, but the hair looks kinda different in a way from number 4... I guess they did a really good job tweaking it ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
*inserts south park followup Kanye song*
---
Yeah I'm not complaining, it's honestly a gorgeous set
---
Yay! This and the pumpkin head Moa are gonna look awesome together.
---
Pfft. Amateur.
---
Well no, that would be stupid. Instead, it's a 0.00000001% chance drop from BLC.
---
You're right, thanks for correcting me.
---
Also because DH does better damage than weaver in fractals
---
Here's a video of the new skin, so you can see how they function.   
---
  
---
[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L62FWH2D5j0)
---
An event featuring invisibility, then?
---
sorry, I cant
---
Im pretty sure they just wanted it look better than in reality. But hey, Im really enjoying land spears art team teased me with in HoT trailer
---
Thankfully it's being shown on a known armor skin set from one of the last couple Halloweens.
---
Ah WoW...the memories...
---
They are 500 gems a piece. There isn't a package deal as of yet.
---
TIL Arena Net devs use the Warclaw in PvE zones
---
Yeah, but it makes me wonder...could there be some kind of 'emote' available as a drop from the event?
---
I've observed that once ANET thinks up something (eg. Chairs) they run with it...often too far (eg. SO MANY CHAIRS), but they run with it.
---
In the Prologue they gave us the Rockout emote.  Could we be looking at the spooky emote? Spooky dance?
---
Aurene DID eat Mad King Thorn's greatest known rival :D
---
Happy to have you ^_^
---
Y'know at lunch I was looking through my inventory, seeing what un-customized pieces of armor I had lying around to piece together a set, to try this out.
---
Nobody around to blame for this but you ;)
---
Just like the greatsaw
---
Ah, the scavenger's causeway
---
Oh no, how dare they do exactly what they advertise and make yearly festivals static?
---
In all honesty if Aurene starts taunting Thorn and going about how he'll rue the day, I think that'll truly be the end of me caring for any lore.
---
&gt; Feels like the final step in selling out for money with 0 consideration for immersion and whatnot
---
A cursory glance at the gemstore kind of disproves this statement.
---
Shout out to those madmen apparently doing the labyrinth race on Warclaws for some reason.
---
Ya I'm not going to miss it.  I for one am ready for a break from that build.
---
immersion flew right out of the window once they started selling wings, a paper bag is far beyond that tipping point
---
I see what you did there
---
I wish those flames only show up when in combat mode
---
Sure! 
---
Reward tracks for the map; you can find them on the reward tracks tab on the pvp ui, on the left side. Pick a map you need the skins, but cant be arsed to do all those achievements, finish the reward track (ranked or unranked work, custom games do not, anymore). 
---
You can also save pvp potions to fast finish the tracks as you go, or save them for event reward tracks which tend to be very profitable (wintersday for example, i save all my potions for the year, and on wintersday i use them all and sell all the gifts, the amount of flat gold you can get instantly is INSANE!

Scourge needed a trade off. Now there is one.
---
nothing new, it‘s some kid NPCs playing dress up, they always run around LA during Halloween
---
Nthn new. Downvote
---
Yup. You meet in the middle and race around the outside paths before going back through the middle again.
---
Or if you truly have bag issue for fractal, make a new character where you ONLY run fractal/raid on it, 100 slots is more than enough for you to run CMs+T4s+recs without clearing your bag once.

BUY IT NOW!

YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO THINK! BUY IT NOWWWW!!!!

LOL that would be awful... I was just thinking King Thorn would have some added dialog... Maybe even some new [Madly Funny Jokes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Madly_Funny_Joke)?

The Forgotten were there first.

Thats the nature of pvp combat in MMOs, and honestly many other games with extensive amount of choices of skills, or characters, nothing you can do about it other than decide on your if it is worth the steep learning curve climb, or not. 
---
As for the quitters, it is frustrating, demoralizing, but on the long run, know that their poor attitudes will net them more loses than you and thus possibly lower ranking, regardless of their skill level.
---
The thing i love about gw2 pvp is how much i can twinkle with builds. Im constantly theory crafting and trying new things, from trait/runes/sigil combinations, to trying out classes im less familiar with! Some with more success than others, but i find fun in that exploration, it keeps the mode very fresh for me. At the end of the day, it is up to you what you do with your time on how you enjoy, or wish to enjoy content. :)
---
And theres still dps slots. My point was the "Meta" in t4s is broken in almost all runs as the meta is Heal Brand, alacren, BS and 2 DPS  but people regularly run without alacren, HB and BS in T4s, especially BS and alacren who are regularly tossed for DPS and the HB regularly gets tossed as well for a very off-meta healer.

Well now I am curious, what is is that makes me shitty? While I have not posted on here about it I am not happy about the change either and have certainly complained about it as well.
---
Excuse me do we know each other, or are you just a cunt to everybody?
---
I meant weapon skins, you can find tier1,2,3 cultural weapon vendor in all 5 major cities.
---
Do you know what hurts the most?
---
The truth.
---
I play a self crafted core guardian build, core warrior build and tempest staff support build, and im doing fine. Many high ranking players/streamers play extremely weird builds and still do fine. Meta is just a start to get a grasp of whats going on, as you learn your class and how YOU as a player work, the kond of playstyle you enjoy, what you prioritize in bringing to the game and your team determines how you go from there and change this builds to better fit you.

It's more accurate to say AMD's bulldozer line was garbage.  Back in the athlon 64 &amp; Pentium 4 days, AMD was better than Intel.
---
* Timestamps are appreciated.
---
* Mic quality hampers the otherwise good overall quality.
---
* Talking feels rushed; it's a common thing when you read from script, but doesn't really fit your format.
---
* Music a bit loud and distracting sometimes.
---
* Game footage well curated and really helpful.
---
* Styles could use some polishing.
---
* "Over 19 weapons", come on :D
---
* Large stylized fonts hard to perceive when they're disappearing fast and when there's speaking over it. Would be better if you at least spoke identical text to what's on the screen, or had less focus on the screen.
---
* Mega-servers: worth noting that people aren't playing "together" on a single server at the same time but are distributed across multiple instances of a map.
---
* Dat skill-clicking in WvW/PvP...
---
* Probably could've mentioned the 9th profession at the start of the video as well.
---
Overall, a well-scripted overview and very good points on the pluses of the game from a perspective of a casual/busy player who actually is the main audience of the game. The video is still rough around the edges and could've had a bit more production value, but good to see such a video nonetheless since most people who venture into making game reviews would definitely not be considered "casual", and their opinion is biased respectively.
---
Can we talk about how scourge isnt OP anymore?
---
The problem is that Scourge wasn't strong in PvE, yet the WvW-centric nerf has leaked over to PvE anyway.
---
I can finally recreate my AO fixer

I have no problem with the actual longevity of the festival because 2 weeks after it releases build templates will release and people will be using the labryinth to test out builds.
---
https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/weaver/condition/
---
This is a decent build, feels very glassy with very good damage exactly as you described. I'd recommend using dagger/focus or dagger/dagger before you unlock Weaver and if you're going to use the above build for open world you might want to grab Pyromancer's Puissance so you can self-buff might.
---
I think the video is very well done and professional on the presentation aspect, but the message is a little confusing. 
---
I'm not exactly sure what the intention of your video is. You appear to be targeting casuals with your title, but its a 35min video that goes into a lot of detail that casuals may not be interested to know. 
---
It's also lacks a roadmap. You jump from hearts, to the living stories, back to dungeons and raids, over to PvP, over to crafting etc. 
---
Anyway, not trying to be critical, I just don't fully understand the direction of the video, or what the intent of future videos may be.
---
I got my character name changed a while back with the excuse that i changed the gender to female and the name didnt fit. Guess i got lucky with support?

I literally missed it way back when.

For some reason it just won't return. :(

Scrapper say hi? wvw and spvp messing pve since season 3 of spvp...
---
worse, I play the 3 modes so I feel directly the changes affecting each other. T-T
---
Shades are untargetable, and honestly (as a necromancer mainl they had a braindead playstyle. I would have personally liked a traited design, like a range/melee option toggle with different effects to add variety and balance but not the insanity they had pre-patch.
---
The current changes made scourge really more interactive by having to think about when to use F2-5 if the boss moves and if you have charges of F1 ready to be replaced. In WvW it feels the same as before, you just need a bit more support by the firebrands but even as solo off squad is incredible easy not to die.
---
With many more different designs/patterns available for 600 gems each in the game store! Sale ending soon! You can buy 1 more at the current price.

Ahh, Mitran. I'm glad this comment chain didn't go unnoticed.

I'm hoping they have plain and ignited versions.  But not tied to the day night cycle.  Have them ignite after you eat candy corn.

Does anyone know if people still run metas on the old LS3 Maps(NA)? Or know a group that does?
---
Got back into the game and finally started working toward Aurora but sort of stuck on the "Druid Backpack" and "Draconis Mons Master" achieves cause no one runs the meta or the map is too dead to help with the killing of champs like Webby
---
anet is so scared of offending china that cantha will never be revisted
---
You can chat link the templates meaning you can save the links in a personal guild message of the day or a text document and link them again at any time.
---
As much as I enjoy GW2, their egregious monetization of nickle-and-diming everything is a huge plague for the game. Sure, there's no subscription, but there's also barely any expansions to generate more income, which means that they release pretty much 90% of the stuff exclusively in the gem store.
---
The upcoming build templates are a great example of this. It's a feature even casual players would probably use 5-6 slots of builds on their few main characters, but it will be heavily restricted in addition to have a low cap amount. You'll have to buy those individually.
---
As someone who's tired of this shit, I don't think I'll ever spend one more cent on the gem store. ArenaNet is getting greedy with GW2. I was already tired of pretty much 98% gliders being gemstore only, then all mount skins being gemstore only and now having a heaviy-requested feature being heavily monetized is just the tipping point.
---
If they sold an expansion that contains expansion-level kind of new features and content, and built templates were included in that expansion, I would gladly pay for the expansion to get access to them. But the nickle-and-diming each slot multiple times is just horrible. Just gimme a bulk price of $1-2k gems for the FULL feature, then we'll talk again.
---
Unfortunately, I tried many MMO and there's not one that tops GW2 currently, but GW2 does have a lot of shortcoming.
---
I don't know, from all the places to possibly go I do not think GW2 is an attractive sell right now. Yes it's a great experience and tons of content for a new player, but there is very little end game goals that most people from WoW are used to, and no expansions on the horizon making this a difficult sell compared to other MMO's on the market right now.
---
Come back to GW1.
---
Make it a renaissance! ;)
---
Not for GW2 but there seems to be a growing movement in protest of the company and its holdings, my guess would be the majority land in FFXIV.
---
&gt; maybe they should have made shades  to be similar to ventari tablet
---
Now that is a cool idea!!
---
Thanks that really means a lot :) Let me know if anything needs to be updated or is still missing (it's very much still a work in progress)!
---
People really look at old games with intense nostalgia goggles. I'm not saying they're bad, but people tend to severely overblow their statements about everything the game has to offer even if it's blatantly untrue.
---
Do you feel like this change has completely gutted your favourite espec/class to the point where you are no longer effective, and that the change is unjustified?
---
If you feel that way, then you have your answer.
---
Ah, the repeat threads.
---
Guild wars has always held up to higher standards. I highly recommend Anet over Blizzard.
---
Thank YOU! for everything :)
---
That dance was one that's already in the game, though.
---
Arena.net has broken a lot of promises, but they've fired a lot of people since then so while we're in a slump right now the people responsible aren't really around anymore.
---
Especially for Smiters Boon.
---
Hol up

Thank you for everything you've done and I wish you the best!

No amount of nerfs have a chance to overshadow everything you've done for GW as a whole.
---
Oh, I'm seriously considering it. I still think GW1 is far ahead in terms of feature-complete online game.
---
Some *slight* lynching is in order, right?
---
No. Kongzhong is still putting out news and announcements on their webpage.
---
Thank you for everything :)
---
People leave WoW and come back for expansions all the time. Can't really say the same for GW2.
---
then why subbed to gw2reddit?
---
On the straights the Raptor can get the edge though. That's from my experience at least (I used to use Jackal but was caught out in the straights).
---
They trade the Death Shroud and a life force health bar for the Shades and Sand Shroud and barrier.
---
In my experience, people who complain the most and most effusively about a change are usually the very people engaging in the actions that prompted the change in the first place.
---
It's the "this is why we can't have nice things" effect.
---
k BUT is it for a friend?

Blitzchung, a top tier hearthstone player won a tournament amd during an interview stated that he supported the riots in hong kong. Blizzard responded by taking back all of his winnings and banning him for a year. In addition they fired the 2 commentators who interviewed him.

This is nice of you

Balance shouldn't be judged on how the 0.01% of the playerbase deals with something.

ESO does that

I have only the utmost respect for you. Thank you for everything. Stay awesome.

you can buy gems for ingame currency, so there is no "monetization issue",
---
I aDORE
---
Oh *come on*.
---
Don't be a cringey white knight and try to excuse them.
---
GW2 has a monetization issue it must acknowledge in order to improve.
---
It's better to be up front with anyone new interested in GW2. If they can look past it and go in with grounded expectations, then they can enjoy the game better,
---
Yeah because new players are going to worry about end game at level 1. 
---
"Hmm, lemme not enjoy hundreds of hours of game time because I'm so stuck on what I'm going to be doing in an endless loop at a much later time"
---
Because reddit is community based. I love this game, but the choices anet made are not for me so i'm not playing anymore, but i'm still around
---
Overblow, exaggerate, overstate and down right repetitive.
---
they didn't "lay off" 2 developers, 2 devs were rude and one of them was outright toxic towards gw2 customer/s, they were both fired, completely independent of the layoffs. they have had a few controversies, the biggest one was the time they banned a couple hundred people and 8 months later one of the banned players submitted a GPDR request and figured out that anet in their incompetence had banned a lot of innocent players because of their inability to write and read a spyware program that was installed with a gw2 update.
---
Wut
---
That's one of the things that could work. 
---
Once all shades have been placed, the F1 skill could flip over to a different skill to help with th eissue of being defenseless when all shades have moved away. Stuff like: 
---
* Moving shades like the ventari tablet:
---
 * With 3 shades, star moving the one that was placed first, the oldest one, and taking turns after that, first, second, third, first, second third. 
---
 * Maybe for a small cost of life force like 1%, but and also making the shade cause an effect when crossing enemies or allies, like 2s crippled on enemies or a bit of barrier on allies. 
---
* Cancel the shades altogether, erasing them so the shade skills can work around the necromancer instead.
---
 * Maybe also recovering a bit of life-force per shade, very small like 1% from each 5-target shades and 2% from the 10-target one.
---
* Pull shades to self.
---
 * With a cooldown so it can't be done too often.
---
* Switch places with a shade.
---
 * At a cost of life force so it can't be followed with too many shade skills.
---
Or non-tattered Council armors. 
---
Look at them Seraph lookin' all shiny and stuff, and we have to get an armor that is all dented.
---
we don't actually know that the people responsible aren't around anymore. the people also weren't fired, 2 devs were fired last year but the layoffs this year were because of a different reason.
---
Because playing games designed by morons is clearly the best way to spend your time. 
---
It's more likely that they lacked the time to implement it before their deadline for the festival.
---
Ok, anyone else feel like trailers are getting pretty.... uh, bad?
---
Everyone complaining about Anet should have his MMO time locked to SW:TOR for a month. Others being worse doesn't make this one better, but it *does* adjust one's reality.
---
I'd love to get a commission done at some point. Saving this for later
---
the information you are leaving out is that people will have to spend hundreds, if not thousands of hours grinding to gain a couple of items.
---
I hate if people whisper to someone, but they can't whisper back, because they are not online.
---
So many of my friends that won't do GW2 ask first "what's the endgame like?" The moment they hear about a minuscule raid scene, no gear growth, and lack of usual theme park MMO trappings, they're gone before they even try it.
---
Morally? Repugnant, to be sure.
---
But it makes sense.  Why?  What if China decided to boycott Blizzard titles because they didn't take action against this person for their political statement?  And as an authoritarian regime, China could very well make that happen.
---
If you were running Blizzard, what choice would you have?
---
That primarily depends on what CPU you get.  Also, if you already have a case or other components that you're salvaging from another build, that would factor in.  PartPicker will help a lot if you plug everything else in first.
---
See you in 90s
---
No chance, GW2 is basically the antithesis of WoW. The three people who actually give enough of a shit to truly switch games will most likely end up with FFXIVIXIVwhatever.
---
Thanks for the feedback!  The music and mic was the hardest thing for me to lockdown and I'll need to find a better balance and make a preset.  I bought a Blue Yeti awhile ago and tried to dampen noise as much as I could but the mic is so sensitive.  I've been trying to plug the audio through audacity and apply noise reduction filters as well as reduce the amplification so that persistent hum wouldn't be in the background.  Maybe I need a better mic or a mic that picks up audio from a specific direction.
---
Yea, the "19 weapons" thing was a head-scratcher for me.  I wanted to tell the viewer that there was variety to the weapons so I listed a few of them... but when I went to the wiki I counted 19 weapons... but then I thought about Engineer kits... so, yea.  :)  And, yes, I click in PvP/WvW!  
---
What do you mean by "styles could use some polishing"?  
---
Anyways, I appreciate the feedback.  I'll try to get the audio situation fixed and be a little less eager to use text over the video in the next one!
---
the chinese overloads got their hands in blizz's pockets :D
---
last controversy over player&amp;dev was between Jessica (spitting) Price and Deroir when Anet simply cut off themselves from this dev and Deroir is still very liked and respected guy :)
---
*laughs in Chrono*
---
Their loss.
---
Pretty much... They ruined it by abandoning the flagship of pure cooperative online RPG.
---
I still wish for another CORPG instead of MMORPG to emerge with a much robust engine and gameplay. GW1 is still great, don't get me wrong, but I think it's time for a new game in its genre to emerge. We have so many MMORPG games and so very little CORPG.
---
&gt;You will get your chance to get crazy about the cash shop update in your cash shop game soon enough
---
So.....GW2? Cause that's what they do every few weeks for years.
---
You think that is worse than denying a player their winnings from a tournament and firing casters for just being the casters of that tournament?
---
For me, a film major, this one is really good! I would cut one or two shots but it's really good from film and trailer standpoint :)
---
It's a sad day to see you go Izzy, you will be sorely missed. However, good luck with whatever you plan to do in the future &lt;3
---
Trash &amp; Thrash are 2 different things. I personally think trash makes more sense
---
Most people just like to read it takes a lot of spoons to post publicly on the internet as it's vulnerable especially about something you work on. 
---
Step back and realize criticizing someone in a good bye post about not talking to the community is a bit ironic an example of something other people can take hard. Time and place my friend not every message needs to be the soap box in which you get your point on the table. : ) Forgive the hard reply I have a hard time turning off the blunt and I'm trying to reply to everything! :)
---
You should go play FF14 instead. You never have to pay money for microtransactions. You'll love it.
---
One has to wonder how many bots did you buy in order to not just give yourself so many upvotes, but also Silver and Gold.
---
You are looking at a company that chose to fire developers for standing up against sexism, just because they were afraid to lose market. Unless you are the type of people who refuse to believe that oppressing women is in violation of human rights. I honestly don’t see any difference.
---
There have been drama with ArenaNet in the past, NCsoft less so due to - before 2019 - their very hands-off approach for ArenaNet. People in this reddit like to shit on ArenaNet left and right though, so they **will** claim otherwise.
---
The most political ArenaNet has ever gotten is dealing with a now former employee, Jessica Price, who went on a bit of a twitter rampage against a content creator for a reasonable and polite response to JP's reaction to a recent AMA discussion. Bunch of super hostile remarks were made, another dev came in to defend her, this all happened over 4th of July vacation, and the two devs were fired as a result of it all for improper behavior while representing ArenaNet on social medias.
---
Beyond that, the only outright fiasco would be the layoff situation.
---
As of late, ArenaNet has been becoming increasingly worse when it comes to monetization in micro-transactions. If you take a particular stance in that ever-growing controversy, ArenaNet is likely heading to a place you won't like. And there has been some increasingly embarrassing merchandising and partnership situations. But this is very different from the Blizzard situation that just occurred as it's non-political; just questionable business practices.
---
What exactly did this person think they would gain by dragging blizzard into this?
---
&lt;3
---
&gt; please the Chinese/Koreans too by removing mixed asian influences 
---
Can you give some examples?
---
Only just started (re)playing one of their games. Otherwise yeah you're right on.
---
Feedback is awesome in all forms, I would never ever suggest not giving the feedback just think about your words sometimes, while I'm so bad at written words they are silly powerful and the same thing can be said in many different ways.
---
You shouldn't expect a company to care about human rights at the expense of of their bottom line. They don't work like that.
---
Why are some of you guys so aggressive? If the game is so bad and all updates suck, maybe you should try to play something else.
---
It's always better to speak to the fans in this case. I can Google for hours and get all sorts of hot takes. But I've learned so much more here.
---
Thank you for all the time you've spent here, in game, and with us all of those years!
---
I assume it has to be Halloween themed?
---
&gt; you can figure out that gw2 is on its last legs.
---
Not even close. Last legs would be no more content updates, what you guys all call maintenance mode. GW 1 is on its last legs. That's what it looks like. That game is only alive because it can be run on the same servers that run GW 2, effectively running it for free. 
---
GW 2 has at least a year of content on the way and what ever is planned for afterwards. This game isn't even close to dying. Sure, it stumbles a lot. But what MMO doesn't? 
---
&gt; do not want to waste time and money on a game that isn't going to last for the foreseeable future.
---
Then you may as well as never do anything because you never know when something might stop working, existing or even make it to live. Many people invested time and money into Bless and Black Desert and yet here we are. One game that got shut down and another that saw a mass exodus.
---
Fuck, plenty of people still purchase GW 1 just to play through it, knowing very well that that game isn't going to be seeing any new content ever. And that the end game is basically dead because not enough people are around to do it. So you either solo it with heroes or you move on. And you can't even bother with PvP.
---
If they wanna grind gear, that's fine. It's fun sometimes, sure. But if that is the sole reason as to why you never try this game then good riddance. Probably spend the entire time bitching about it which only sours the experience even more and annoys the hell out of everyone else.
---
They aren't excusing them. They are pointing out you can buy all that shit by grinding. You know, just like you have to do for anything in WoW, on top of paying a monthly fee for the privilege to play a game you already paid for.
---
Don't undervalue yourself, time is the only non renewable resource you give a lot of it and everyone here wouldn't exist without it.
---
Thank you :)
---
They didnt drag blizzard into anything, they simply made a statement about their current thoughts and feelings in general at the end of an interview. This had nothing to do with blizz, nothing to do with the commentators. Just a guy showing solidarity towards other people who are currently getting shit on by their government.
---
Thank you, the feels are kicking my butt today.
---
Blizzard never had any integrity.
---
They have always shilled for China and treated their playerbase like absolute crap.
---
The later is part of the reason the original Guild Wars devs broke off and formed their own studio in the first place.
---
0.01% of players can't break the game for anyone.
---
I think the number is MUCH higher.
---
Honestly, what makes GW1 so good is the cohesion in all game modes.
---
In GW2, personal story plays different than open world which plays different than dungeons which plays differently than raids.
---
In GW1, the only difference between a story mission and its explorable zones are the fact missions have specific objectives and endpoints. However, both are the same in a sense of level design. Booth are scaled for the same amount of players, and both have patrolling enemies and danger abound.
---
Perhaps the biggest reason GW1 was so ahead of its time was its focus on gameplay over story. 
---
In GW2 story missions, they attempt to tell a heavily scripted narrative as if it were a stage play, and every single enemy encounter has a dialogue build up and story justification.
---
In GW1, you have a bit of dialogue at the start of a mission, maybe  cutscene, then you're just sent on a 30 minute adventure where you try to kill shit and reach the end of the level, sometimes fulfilling unique or side objectives.
---
A shitty situation, to be sure, but thats what happens when you deal with devils.
---
It doesn't destroy wvw, it's just a continuation of unfun gameplay, more range pressure from scourges but also a bit less by heralds, overhall it's almost the same except the fact that scourges need a bit more sustain from their party. The fact that it's overhall the same is the issue which means it's still bad.
---
The crown pavilion use to be a big whole and in divinities reach all human cultures have divisions except cantha is missing.
---
Really? Call me ignorant then but it just doesn't seem good to me. Previous years have been better. Season 4 also comes to mind.
---
* hold
---
No, you're amazing!
---
Thanks for everything and we'll be keeping an eye on you at [mana.works](https://mana.works), keep the others safe!
---
Godspeed!
---
Probably a decently high amount.
---
Same goes with the movie business, they constantly change crap to make the Chinese happy.
---
I'll do my best thank you
---
I would say search.
---
Never trust google as they have shown many times over now that they care more about their political agenda over truth.
---
get out of here with this shit.
---
I'm going to get some lunch I'll try and keep up with responding to everything best I can but may be some random delays. &lt;3
---
The scorge buff makes good scourges in zerg gameplay really strong but the cleanse changes have more impactful.
---
Any new Halloween story to give us more on Thorn and his court?
---
You are awesome! Thanks for everything :)
---
But still, their reaction pissed off everyone who supports the protests, and not because they were abiding by their policy, but because of how harshly they enforced it, it truly look like they are supporting the inverse of what the guy supported
---
You're welcome! : )
---
Robbing you makes more sense than working for our money like a chump. Maybe people should take your advice and follow what makes sense instead of what is morally right?
---
1. Artificial scarcity
---
2. No one has enough gold. Especially with increasing prices over time.
---
3. It doesn't justify why ALL mounts and gliders are in the gemstore.
---
Thank you so much. GW1 was the first game I ever got into and I’m glad it was.
---
Its not about standing up against sexism, its how she did it. I remember the scandal and the way she was talking was more mysandrist than femenist.
---
Some people only play for the endgame, especially in WoW where there is a higher focus on grinding the latest tiers and gearing up. Perhaps I am wrong but if I was looking for a new MMO right now, ESO got a new expansion this year, FF got a new expansion with raving reviews. 
---
Suddenly Gw2 doesn't seem as attractive to someone looking for a new MMO to play and they're going to ask 'what about endgame', where players spend most of their time. There's shit ton of content that is great to do and so much value, I personally would recommend it to anyone more casual but I do think expansions bring so much value and interest that gw2 isn't offering right now.
---
What exactly is the point of this post?...
---
That's their problem.
---
The lack of constantly having to make better gear with more inflated stats was what caused many of us to come to GW2 in the first place.
---
No No No we must go to the armory...
---
to thank you!
---
how many devs left anet in just the past 4-5 weeks now?
---
While I don't think that the existence of gold to gems excuses ArenaNet of *any* monetisation schemes, let's be real, the game throws gold at you. Don't paint the picture as if it's infeasible to use the currency conversion on any sort of regular basis. A new player that still needs to get their gear, crafting professions, inventory slots, mounts, etc. sorted definitely won't be able to spend much gold on the gemstore, granted, but you very quickly hit a point in this game where you start gaining a steady influx of gold without much dedicated grind that you can very comfortably put towards gemstore items.
---
I'd rather see the effect of Spirits homogenised and made available through other means (Tempest shouts?) and other healers improved for Might output. FB and Ren need toned down (just as a I used to argue that Chrono needs toned down) and we still need more viable options in the healing/might and alacrity/quickness area. 
---
Along with that, it'd be lovely to have damage patterns that actually mattered and resulted in engaging healing but that sort of intricacy won't come with healing that doesn't have a resource that can be depleted.
---
You mean the rule that says if you make Blizzard look bad they can punish you? Because that is the rule they are saying he broke.
---
As you say, I'll downvote you.
---
I said thrash because the 3 songs gave me some thrash metal vibes
---
I disagree. Fanbase is subjetive and most of the time is love/hate. You should search objetive sources tbh.
---
But then again Google has its own agenda like someone else said haha
---
Oh wow. I remember years ago during GW1 having a discussion with you about how to balance, primarily about an Assassin Elite skill that wasn't doing so well (Seeping Wound, maybe?). It was a weird interaction for me because I was still in high school and you responded to my statements as though they had merit. Me, some dorky kid with near no programming knowledge, warranted a respectful response from the guy actually in charge of making some of these changes. And it wasn't even a dismissal response, you took my thoughts seriously and kinda posed why you thought they would or wouldn't work. It was a really cool interaction. Now, I don't remember if you kept a damn thing I suggested and actually put it in game, but simply the act of taking the suggestions seriously was really cool for me.
---
Good luck going forward, and stay cool.
---
It is easy for a single person to take a moral stance, eg, those who have announced they are going to quit Hearthstone/Blizzard over this.  
---
It's another thing when you are responsible for running a company employing thousands of people, generating billions in revenue, supporting hundreds of millions of fans.
---
Should it be different?  In a perfect world, no it wouldn't be.  But we don't live in a perfect world.
---
For what it's worth, I haven't supported Blizzard for years, nor will that ever change.  I've perma-banned them from life, albeit for different reasons.
---
anet evil corporation whinging
---
Yes, and good on the fans for showing their anger.  Sadly, this is about pure math.  Someone at Blizzard, either rightly or wrongly, figures they will lose more $$$ pissing of China than they would pissing off fans in the rest of the world.
---
Best of luck on your future projects!
---
The thought itself is interesting. though. Would Anet tell NCSoft to tell China to go fuck itself?
---
Depends on the previous owner.

Welcome to language evolution!  Also known as historical or diachronic linguistics.  While most of the field focuses on how languages have already changed, it is also fun to see it happen in today's living languages.
---
Oh yes, that was my second favourite moment. Logging back in after the patch, the ominous message in chat, the shrieks of botters and the merciless reaping of the offenders.
---
Not that I never raged about changes you made... (I mean, I was waaay too into my pvp back then), but you're a damn cool dude. Can't wait to see what you and the gang get up to!
---
Easy:
---
P = NP
---
Divide both sides by P
---
1 = N
---
Taking N as 1, we have
---
P = (1)P
---
Which by definition is true, QED. Send the Turing award in the mail.
---
I did not get the credit chest, was repping my 1 man guildbank where the race was active and it still shows not completed yet in the guildpanel.
---
Ah, the days when asking for basic human rights counts as "political views"...
---
Put 2 and 2 together, Hes literally responded to everyone in this thread now that hes leaving Arenanet.
---
There is a high chance they just aren't allowed - Which sucks but it's not their fault so there's no point attacking him over it.
---
I’d suggest you check out the WoW and Hearthstone subs.
---
Thank you for your hard work and dedication to bring balance to classes and keep their feel rewarding despite uncountable controversial opinions (internal cool down to meteor fireballs, size, and amount wtf) and wish you the best of luck moving forward.
---
Mostly use action cam now.  It helps some, but it still doesn't feel 100% responsive
---
Regardless of their actions against the player, they had no right to fire the two guys just doing their job bringing in the guy for an interview, as was their jobs as official commentators for blizzard at the Taiwanese Tourney
---
Ah, Divinity's Reach!
---
1.) It's a virtual world, all scarcity is artificial. (Awww did you think you were clever when you pointed that out?)
---
2.) I don't have tons of gold and still can scrounge up enough gold for 800 gems. There are at least 2 people in my gold that came make 400 gold in 2 weeks of grinding events. There are people playing with literally thousands of gold on their account.
---
3.) Mount and glider SKINS, you still get the mounts from the game. Buying them is for cosmetic purposes, They aren't necessary to the game to play it.
---
4.) Loot boxes are trash that a lot of games do for revenue.
---
5.) Don't buy loot boxes then. Simple problem with a simple solution. You can just buy the skin on the TP when someone puts one up for sale.
---
None of all of that changes the fact you can convert game currency into gems.
---
Who needs integrity when we got P L A Y A B L E  F O X E S
---
Regardless of what the number is, the point remains the same. If one player discovers some broken combo or skill application and they share it publicly, all of a sudden the whole playerbase potentially has the ability to exploit the issue. It only takes one player to reinvent how something is played at the meta level. Smash Melee and Overwatch have both shown that, and Guild Wars is not exempt.
---
Have like 3 toons to lv up whit the lab!!! Ready for the farm.
---
Stop horsing around.
---
Thanks for the years of fun Izzy, can't wait to see what you &amp; the new crew do next. Anet/GW made it easy to get over Blizzard North falling apart and I'm sure this will be no different, so, you know, totally manageable expectations &amp; all. (no but really, super psyched!)
---
At this point saying I support free speech or capitalism is political. I mean honestly what is not political in this day and age? Fuck, saying you believe in or don't believe in climate change (a scientific theory) is political at this point.
---
&gt; If you were running Blizzard, what choice would you have? 
---
How about a slap on the wrist? How about a "please no taking political stances" but letting them keep the winnings and MAYBE suspend them for a bit? Why do you have to go so extreme as to immediately ruin their esports career? Why harshly punish everyone involved in that situation? 
---
Like, honestly it's insane you're even defending the fact that this massive corporation just instantly dismantled any trust anyone had in ANY of their tournaments (who's to say they won't take back their winnings if you win an Overwatch final?) just to appease a LOUD small demographic of people. Bruh, Blizzard isn't a Chinese corporation, they can pull out of China COMPLETELY and be fine. Actually more than fine, they can continue breaking sales records with or without China, so why are you implying that they're backed against a corner?
---
Also, Blizz devs agree with the takes I've professed, they've been putting up small displays of protest around their workplace (like taping paper over statues to "silence" them). The devs themselves are fucking angry at this shit, yet you're here going on about "how easy it is for you or I to get angry but let me make excuses for blizz the mega corporation for a bit".
---
I would be happy if everyone else in the industry had the same attitude :I.
---
Apparently that's all politics, come to think of it. A bunch of people asking for fights and a bunch of others saying no.
---
potential miss click? XD
---
&gt; I nerfed both builds after that weekend and repairing because of that night and probably needed to nerf them more
---
This is the Izzy we know and love o7
---
Why would you cower to someone like that? What makes you think they will stop there? They will keep taking more and more and more.
---
They will never be satisfied and they will drag you down with them.
---
And these 'new' wow races look like they use the exact Goblin (the fox thing) and gnome (mechagnome) skins.
---
Human limbs are just not meant to do that.... Our arms are too short.
---
Glad to have made a difference
---
Thanks, and one can never have too much luck.
---
in the end it depends on which masteries you have or not have.
---
Yes. We can.
---
It's already been talked about ever since the patch notes preview hit though.
---
Thanks for watching.  If you think it'd be useful for bringing more people to the community pass it along and share it.  :)  I know it's long but I wanted to make sure I covered enough so players that enjoy story, open-world content, exploration, PvP, raids and instances, and so on would have information to pull them in.  Subsequent videos will be shorter.
---
I was in the same boat as you with the guild hunt.  I eventually started talking to people I saw in game, asking about their guilds, and specifically, how active their Discord channels are.  I wanted a guild that had an active Discord so I could be part of the community outside the game.  Discord is on my phone, desktop, and running in my browser at work so I can pop in regularly to see what's going on.
---
I'm currently in a guild that I'm enjoying.  Send me a PM here or a shoot me a message in game (Chickenooble.5014) and I'll give you the name of the person to talk to.
---
Hope this helps and thanks again for the feed back!
---
Late in 2006 I lost a brother to a car accident. We played a lot of mmos together, and while I didn't get to play gw1 with him (I only started on January 2007), it helped a lot in my grieving process to just immerse myself in that amazing world for hours and hours and hours. There's no right way to grieve and that one was probably not healthy, but GW1 was with me during some really tough and really happy times.
---
You've given me a lot, and no matter how many gems or games I buy I can never fully repay you, MO, Colin, everyone. I wish you all the best and I'll definitely keep an eye on Mana Works!
---
ps.: can you please tell everyone to make bag slots account bound please, thank you.
---
ps2.: that was a joke, stay awesome!
---
You should not be surprised when companies act like that, but that does not mean you need to just silently accept it either.
---
No.  There is no theme.  Only major rule we really have is no outfits.  Please see the website for full details.
---
&gt; Perhaps the biggest reason GW1 was so ahead of its time was its focus on gameplay over story.
---
This pretty much sums it up. They try to push the narrative REALLY hard even at the cost of less replayable content.
---
&gt; In GW1, the only difference between a story mission and its explorable zones are the fact missions have specific objectives and endpoints. However, both are the same in a sense of level design. Both are scaled for the same amount of players, and both have patrolling enemies and danger abound.
---
And this really hits home. The fact that you have multiple things in the same zone to do means that you go back quite a bunch of times in the same map, be it for Zaishen quests, Vanquishing, quest (story), exploration, etc.
---
The title system over the achievement system was so so much better too as these were long-term goals and not just a bunch of clutter to try and make it seems there's more content in a small map of LS. They had a lot of worth behind them instead of GW2's achievement/title system.
---
The fact that you had to accomplish to kill patrolling enemies to get to X point or try to evade the mobs lying around was really great. You couldn't just WP to X and kill it. Even though you had to do that, it didn't feel like a chore. In GW2, even though we have waypoints, if there isn't a WP close (such as in PoF in LS4 maps), it feels like a chore to walk through the map because there's no point in killing the mobs. They just respawn and you can just run through them with a mount...
---
Even though raids are hardcore content, it doesn't feel like it. Where's the challenge of getting a good team up and kill groups of enemies without dying, aggro them to kill them little by little, avoid groups of dangerous enemies lurking around, etc.
---
I still love doing Vanquishing as it does offer a good dose of challenge with some bosses and some seriously stacked groups of enemies. That was the best. Or even doing dungeons, you have to check where the enemies patrols, if they will aggro more, how much time you got to clear them, what composition they had, etc.
---
Okay, sure, now with an army of 6 mesmers I can roll through 90% of the content without any worries, but there's still that 10% that's posing serious challenge.
---
Most of the people leading the "table" meme philosophy and who presided over the broken promises about grind in the early years are gone.
---
Thank you for everything, I wish you the best!
---
I really loved GW1 and I really enjoyed your anecdote regarding Esoteric Warriors :)
---
&gt; For those that don't know: just Google Blizzard and Hearthstone.
---
Wow, and i just recently have uninstalled all the blizzard stuff from my machine on Oct 6th, for all the different reasons.
---
Ncsoft make some poor decisions such as ruining Aion but blizzard is definitely way more corrupt since the founders all left except Jeff Kaplan. Jeff is a cool guy
---
dont be stupid majority of WoW players are from China thats why they took that stand.  Just like China told Anet not to put Cantha in GW2.  Majority of WoW players can careeless about Esport drama.  Just like Anet temp ban bunch of ppl buying spvp matchup did u leave GW2?  Why would u suggest someone a sinking ship?  U sure pay alot of attention to the other game's drama but not the game u are playing?  Dead game DEV leaving left and right.  New DEV dont dare to touch UI, Game Engine, Server, etc  Its called Maintenenace Mode.
---
Again? xD
---
...did someone just say P L A Y A B L E F O X E S?!
---
Classic :)
---
Thanks Izzy!!!!!!!
---
The only time we will get anyone from Anet to talk about WvW let alone GvGs on reddit.  You gotta hit me right in the feels huh?
---
Thanks for everything you’ve done.  I’m already excited what you and the new team create at MW.  I even sent an email trying to get any information I can on what kind of game you guys are making.
---
Keep stopping by here and chatting with us as you become a player now.
---
This is awesome, you can really feel the emotions of the character. :D
---
Try d912pxy. It won't make the FPS higher, but even out the choppiness.
---
Yeah I love how much a game becomes shared with a community once it launches.
---
Thank you and best of luck &lt;3
---
&lt;3 that pun.
---
Well, for one of the races anyway.
---
The personal story (ie. core story) is super buggy at this point and there havent been any fixes for it in a while. Id suggest skipping it after you do the BLC key parts. However, that said, it seems at some point ANet also broke the ability to disable the personal story, meaning if you never finish it, for lack of want or just due to bugs, then it will forever be on your top right screen--I recently even figured this out as I started playing an alt more and couldnt figure out why the option to hide personal story no longer worked.
---
ah, catering to the massive fury demo
---
I'd say 42 is the answer. Because it has to be right eventually.
---
Really...interesting...
---
&gt; Congratulations. Most of the playerbase cannot. 
---
Sure they can, they just don't want to do it.  It's not like those two players have something special going on. They're just two adults with full time jobs.
---
Again, this proves you can do it without ever spending a cent of your real money. It just won't be as easy as busting out your debit card.
---
I meet them all we where really close. I used to play a lot with them in game when I couldn't sleep late at night (which is always) they came out to E3 for a show down match with a bunch of people live on stage. They asked me to take them to 6 flags. So I took a week off and took them all around. When Jeff heard about my plan he turned to me and said "Expense the whole thing" which was a huge shocker to all of us. We had a blast and now everytime I go to Korea Master and Danjang come and see me sometimes the others do to but we all go drinking and hang out. Those two actually made their own gaming company and are doing great. They adopted me and are truly some of the sweatiest people I've ever meet.
---
Have you heard of Path of Exile?
---
Good luck on your new project and dont be a stranger here. just because you're losing the tag, doesn't mean you have to lose the friends. Just means you get to give feedback as a player now. instead of a dev.
---
But why does P=0?
---
&gt; ...you're arguing that raising the skill floor to a spec shouldn't be considered a nerf...
---
I see this will take a while. Take all the time you need to comprehend what I said. No rush.
---
It's a massive buff in zerg play but everywhere else its a nerf unless you're playing melee power scourge who dosen't even need to use shades at all and can just pop the f1-f5 without having to think at all. Now if you are ranged and on your own or in a small group you throw a shade at them they run at you and you cant protect yourself anymore as you cant legitimately place one at your own location as you would need to start kiting if anyone got that close.
---
It's a terrible change, its an insane trade off the ability to protect yourself for a very oppressive espec, scourge isnt only boon corrupt/epidemic, i'd rather the two be reduced and have the core mechanic back.
---
Glad to be remembered! : )
---
Me too!
---
*recent* they are like this for YEARS.
---
Reinstalling just to run the clock tower a 1000 times. Doing it is just so kino, i can't explain it.
---
\&gt; If you were running Blizzard, what choice would you have? 
---
They can afford to support the right thing. What's happening in Hong Kong is *wrong*. You don't just make games about a hero stepping up to fight injustice, and then step down when injustice happens. The game makes enough money in its other markets.
---
They do more then you think. A common design motto is "Fail Fast and Follow the Fun"
---
:'c
---
German drinking games? I’m surprised you remember anything of that night. O_o
---
NCSoft has a... shall we say *spotty* history, but they also don't have very much control over the development of GW2 - ArenaNet (the developer) largely operates independently, with only one known case of meddling (mandating the removal of a generically-Asian-themed part of a city before launch) that I can think of. It basically just owns ANet and that's it. It's also a Korean company, so it's much less likely to hold pro-China views, and ANet itself isn't a huge corporate entity that will act independently on the topic.
---
If you ever want to chat design hit me on via linken or facebook and send me a message I try and respond to everyone but I don't check it very often so forgive the long response time. Always down to chat design and give advice.
---
the game does not throw nearly enough gold at you to get more than 1 or 2 gem store skins unless you grind for hundreds / thousands of hours. it's certainly feasible, you just have to treat it like a second job.
---
I agree just imagine if we had twitch!!
---
Clever : )
---
I see, wouldn't it be more logical to use it?
---
Wow lol, you’re really an insufferable condescending obnoxious troll until the end. 10/10. I guess I was right, you really just wanted to argue semantics and start an argument.
---
I won’t lower myself to your arrogance, I think you’re fully aware of how haughty from the get-go you were, so that means we’re done.
---
the game runs terribly, microtransactions are getting worse (hello, have you even been paying attention to the last couple of weeks? thought not) releases are still as slow as ever and they have less content than they used to. 
---
i don't know where you got your information from, but it's incorrect.
---
also i recognise your name, you are one of anets white knights lol
---
I have no idea anything about wow, since I haven't played it in over a decade.
---
I was actually suggesting that reuse as you describe is the most reasonable thing to expect with new races in any MMO because of the absolutely insane amount of time it would take to make every armor piece one more time.
---
I'll poke them some but it's hard when your so heads down on working. I love talking to everyone but it takes time.
---
Thank you, and hope the fair winds are good for us all!
---
I don't know much of the plans and if I did probably not the best medium to share them :P but the focus is on other stuff a few people put in some time here or there.
---
i have enough data and you don't like that. as i've said many times, stats from anet would be nice but ultimately they are unnecessary. it's quite a bit more than a guess, all the data points towards the logical conclusion, which you don't like. there is more than enough info for anyone being objective and not biased, which is sadly not the case with you.
---
&gt; if you are worried about blizzards lack of integrity, anet is just as bad, if not worse. while they are not bad in the same sense as blizzard ... **the game is run badly, microtransactions are getting worse, releases are becoming fewer and far between and the only mode getting significant updates is the story (which is pretty badly written) and even that is 3 + months between releases**
---
All of that = lack of integrity?
---
Making video games &gt; coming up with new gemstore ideas to milk a cash cow 
---
Respect to anyone leaving to continue doing good work
---
Izzy thank you for your hard work over the years. Balancing the games must have been absolute nightmare. The theory behind it and the anxiety about how players will react.
---
Whenever I look at Smiter’s Boon and Aegis I will chuckle to myself. 
---
Cheers
---
Always love old photo's send it over via facebook or linken. : )
---
Ah ok in that sense, I didn't notice because we were talking about ash legion :p
---
Well I learned yeah ... but they made me waste 1 hour of Deimos
---
Gosh, I was a PvE guy and just checked the wiki. This is huge
---
OP, there is a free to play version to try it out. Some people have their complaints about they think should be run, but overall the company hasn't done anything like what Blizzard did. I think GW2 is a great MMO, personally and if you want something new you should give the F2P version a try.
---
the fact that they don't admit mistakes or wrong doing (unless forced to, even then they didn't really do it) and lie about "expansion level content" (still waiting to see it), talk about how they renewed their focus on gw2 (in what universe?) on top of all the censorship on the forums because "*we don't like criticism*" and more, yes, they lack integrity.
---
&gt; the game runs terribly, microtransactions are getting worse (hello, have you even been paying attention to the last couple of weeks? thought not) releases are still as slow as ever and they have less content than they used to. 
---
You can repeat yourself as often as you want, it won't become true.
---
&gt; also i recognise your name, you are one of anets white knights lol
---
Uhh, are you one of those "he don't hate XYZ, he's a WhItE kNiGht!!!11" people or are you just a stalker? Whatever it is, it's pretty sad.
---
Just keep giving Z hugs and support he buys me beer all the time : )
---
Go karma whoring somewhere else tyvm.
---
If this is disabling infusion, I will do nothing different. (but I respect your opinion)
---
We designed many of the skills as cards and it was really inspired by Magic.
---
This time it was political and noticeable and even people who aren't involved with gaming think Blizz is taking the wrong side on this. Any previous lack of integrity was easily dismissed with a hand-wave.
---
Its not garbage, its driven by WvW and spvp. Blame the devs for poor spec design in the first place.
---
Thanks for the work and passion put in this amazing games. It's a bittersweet feeling, but the excitement for the future makes the sweet notes even sweeter.
---
Keep us posted! We all wanna know what's coming this way :D
---
the fact that a player had to develop a tool to make the game run better (which still isn't perfect) speaks volumes more than any of your lies.
---
no, as evidenced now and in the past, you have outright lied because of your bias towards anet and gw2. you cannot be seriously thinking that this game doesn't run terribly and be of sound mind.
---
&gt; ike 2 hours of story every 3 + months
---
Lol, another one.
---
Oh don't worry before Smiter's Boon it was called Ether Renewal so I spread the nerf love to all.
---
Getting ready to start a new character.  I want to level my character to 80 using map completion while randomly doing events, crafting along the way, etc.  
---
I usually play a Ranger, but I'm looking for a good class for soloing and exploring.
---
Any advice?
---
What?
---
It was always a tricky balance, we honestly tried to nerf PvE as little as possible. PvPer's like nerfs it's part of the fun seeing things change
---
Dead game mode. Trying to bait with $10 worth of gold isn’t much.
---
1: No, you dont need to raid to be competetive at any other competetive gamemode 
---
2: Keep it, and use it when you decide you want something at some point.
---
Then we're obviously still missing a piece of the question. More skritt, we need more skritt.
---
You're in luck, they announced today that it will start on the 15th.
---
i didn't edit anything out, if i edited that comment i added to it.
---
It's a low, but a very different kind of low. Blizzard just went full scumbag.
---
I wasn't aware it was the easiest class.  I just always play a ranger/hunter in any game I can.  I like the idea of a necromancer though.
---
Uh huh.... don't think I don't see through this ruse. Give away a few shiny and expensive baubles, to get quick access to some of the most potent knowledge available in this game. 
---
Everyone else's fashions! All in one place, all for yourselves, in one fell swoop. Was a good plan, might've even worked. But [i'm onto you](http://i.imgur.com/ZymDlls.gif)
---
On a different note. This is rather nice of you folks.
---
One of my fav was Signet of Ghostly Might. I made a mistake and set the target to "Char" which meant you give cast Signet of Ghostly Might on anyone and 10s later they would die. GvG changed that day, people would all run it, but then a meta formed people would put up Spellbreak to stop the cast, they would interrupt it with Ice Prison a whole meta formed around it and it was pretty fun, I let it go for a day and then came in on Sunday and fixed it. It was so cool to see the balance of the game could handle something so insane and still the meta could adjust. 
---
And still not as over powered as smiters boon
---
a company is not a person, it doesn't have any feelings or morals. It doesn't love you, it want just your money.
---
Yeah I'm all ready in GW2 and no longer in Anet guild and its.... weird
---
I never played a monk so I didn't care :P
---
Just saw [Isaiah's balance](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Isaiah%27s_Balance) and the bow, nice
---
Thanks change is always so hard
---
I remember meeting you at the E3 soon after Factions came out. I remember I had a bunch of questions and you took the time to answer them all even if I can't remember what those questions are now. Thanks for taking the time to put up with younger me!
---
I also still have my skill pins.
---
Conspiracy incoming: shaman already knows what they are for but communicates with ANET about what he is allowed to say; he is used for non-official hype purposes. There have been too many times where I have seen Shaman deliberately withhold information. Just put up a spoiler tag and post everything you know.
---
Great story Izzy.
---
Please don't use ducks to tape things.
---
Aparently they did. You can always dig deeper.
---
Assnet will always be trash. Believe it.
---
You're right, my bad. I looked at the wrong reply. My apologies.
---
Well i am stuck on the 2nd one
---
Druid, rev (support) or chrono (apparently they can tank now? Lol)
---
But if i dont have to raid then im probably going to wvw alot
---
Still, for OP to get a truthful picture, it should be said just how much grinding exactly he would have to do. 
---
Here's for you,  [**u/hallgeir**](https://www.reddit.com/user/hallgeir/) : 
---
You can trade ingame gold for gems which are usually bought with real money. With a pretty lazy farming you can get 20 gold per hour guaranteed - you will instantly sell all materials you farm because auction house supports buy orders. 400 gems cost you 150 gold at average (price fluctuates a bit). So, 400 gems is 7 hours of farming, which isn't just mindlessly killing mobs in one spot, but running around doing events, killing bosses and looting unearthed treasures around a whole map. Now, to the prices themselves.

There isn't a single mount skin for in-game activities, besides the base one you get for each of your mount types, which are by the way the best mounts out of any game you have ever played, single player or no - they have actual physics and feel like a real animal you control with its own unique features, not just a speed boost.
---
There are 4 ways to get a mount skin: 
---
\- a random one from a regular license, with multiple licenses each having a pool of 15 skins. Costs 400 gems. So, 7 hours of farm, or about a week of devoting 1 hour per day. 
---
\- a skin of your choice from the same licenses. Costs 1200 gems, so \~22 hours of farming. 
---
\- mount packs which feature 5-6 skins at once unified by a visual theme. Cost 2000 gems, so 35-40 hours of farming. 
---
\- finally, a legendary mount skin. It is usually the one that changes the mount model the most, up to a completely different animal which sometimes doesn't even share the same animations with the base one. Costs 2000 gems, so 40 hours of farming again. 
---
Now, one thing to consider is that all mount skins besides the base ones are fully and completely dyeable (yes, even the particle effects and eye glow). You can have literally any palette you want, from red and black dragon with metallic grey undertones to an entirely hot pink one. So, imagine getting literally 500+ recolors of Rustbolt Resistance spider mount at once - all for 22 hours of farming. I think I spent more than that doing fucking dailies to reach even just revered. That's for some perspective on things. 
---
There are also lootboxes which are unsurprisingly cancer. They contain a plethora of rewards, usually vendor trash and one token, but sometimes a random weapon skin, and rarely some ludicrously expensive stuff you can sell on auction house but the drop rate is non-existant so you can forget about that in practice. 
---
For the tokens you can buy some stuff of your choice from these lootboxes guaranteed, but the list is small, different from the current loottable of the boxes and updates very slowly, once per 3 months at best, plus the prices are very hefty. 
---
The gemshop also features a TON of weapon and armor skins, as well as toys, pets and utility upgrades like more bank slot, inventory slot that is shared between all characters all the time in your bags, etc. 
---
A weapon skin costs 600 gems, so 10-12 hours of farming. Non-dyeable. 
---
A single visual armor piece (remember those cosmetic helmets from WoW):  200-500 gems, usually dyeable. Meaning you get any recolor you could ever want. 4-8 hours of farming. 
---
Outfit - a visual set that you can't mix with other armor at all, you equip its looks all at once: 700-800 gems, 15 hours of farming. Dyeable. 
---
Glider skin - imagine demon hunter gliding but for all characters, and completely different looks ranging from riding a meteor to having energy currents or steampunk wings gliding you down. Dyable, sometimes wholly, sometimes partly. 400-500 gems, so \~8 hours of farming.
---
Gathering Tool - visual skin for your gathering animation, like mining ore with a plasma beam instead of a mining pick. Features unique animations and unlimited gathering charges (regular tools break after 100 gathers, you have to stockpile them or rebuy). 1000 gems, 18 hours of farming. Non-dyeable.
---
Other stuff is too different to be consolidated into a single category, but it's usually 800 gems, so again, 15 hours of farming.

I've been playing GW1 since its release in 2005 and enjoyed every minute of it. Even though I'm not a gamer anymore like I was 10-12 years ago and even though the game has aged considerably - hey, it's 14 years old! - I still log on a few times a month, just to complete Zaishen quests or participate in the event in Fort Aspenwood on Saturday and Sunday nights, organized by the community. GW1 certainly was (and still is) the best game I've touched. I wish ANet had extended its support for the game for a few more years, like Smiting Monks or Rangers would surely have deserved buffs for PvE. Though I do understand that you and your colleagues preferred to focus on its successor.
---
Thank you for all the time and effort you've invested into the game and good luck for the future!
---
why it's such a quaky idea
---
Thats not lag. It is looking more like the layer issue many fx-effects suffer from. Sometimes the fx fades into the background and pops back if the background changes. Most of the time this occurs on backpacks (the druid stone for example) and was never really fixed, sadly.

I'm sure I got you with some nerf :P
---
Just understand there are not two groups of people, the people who love and respect the game are the ones making the decisions. I know you might not always like them or some times they make a wrong call but it's not two groups of people one who is good and one you think is evil. They are one group of people doing what they think is right, and they care a lot.
---
Necromancer or engineer. Both have alot of sustain and damage, and good variety.
---
People quit their jobs all the time. And when a company has hundreds of employees, people coming and going is common. It's only a big deal because of the drama behind every single action A-Net takes and the fact that most of the devs that left were well known faces in the community, people that the community liked, for a lack of a better word.
---
With WvW I really cannot help, as Im PvE player only. Rev would be my pick for PvE, as Alacrity Renegade is really useful build. And ye, chronos are tanks in raids.
---
Thanks I'll still read this thing every day too much part of my daily loop.
---
Try 2 days.
---
Yeah many players will leave wow when a new expansion is going to be announced in 3 weeks...
---
I've played plenty of MMOs. Most of those games lack end game to start with since those games the game itself was grinding to max level to only then start ganking people that were in lower levels. 
---
I haven't played the classics like Everquest or Ultima, though.
---
oOoOoOo. Looks like I need a new tshirt now.

I would almost argue the same but once you start seeing a lot of Korean movies and Japanese porn, you really start to notice the slight facial structure differences in each Asian type.

It's weird because I've never met you but you've (&amp; the other devs) been a big part of my life since 2003. All the best for the future friend.

If she doens't care about steady gameplay above 30 fps on the lowest settings then 300$ will do with the build already posted here, otherwise i really advise you to save a bit more, it's not just the CPU but also the 8GB of ram is gonna be a big issue
---
I'm heading home, I'll reply some more when I get there thanks for all the chats today I'm going to miss you all &lt;3
---
not having cantha is verrrry different than denying a professional their prize winnings and banning him for a year. blizzard fired the casters too lol, comparing the situations is absurd
---
I don't know who you are as I'm a total newbie but after reading all this and your responses I've got tears in my eyes. Best wishes, my dude. Thank you for your service.
---
Yes. Essentially. Because I never supported Blizzard's choice. Apparently giving out logic is now a declaration of choice. 
---
Here, lemme clarify it for you so you don't get anymore confused.
---
Blizzard did what they had to do. Yes. Was it correct? No. 
---
There, clarified enough? Or do you want a dissertation and a 24 page essay?
---
Imagine not playing their games because of bullshit like this LOL.
---
I might redownload hearthstone now
---
Oh no, you've uncovered our dastardly plans! We might've even gotten away with it too, if it weren't for those meddling Redditors.
---
Yes I can understand that. It’s just a case of reacting to what is clearly being abused and there is no counter to.
---
P.s I mean GW1 Smiters and Aegis 😁
---
Unsubbed from WOW because of all today's stuff and leaping back into GW2. Haven't played GW2 since the month of launch. Where to start? 
---
All tips/advice welcome...
---
Well buddy, the thing is that everyone knows he broke a rule and Blizzard decided to use a vague rule to do this. People don't really care because they feel what they did was wrong and now don't want to support them. 
---
What was your purpose in posting said logic? Did it make you feel like you were unique to post something that wasn't anti-Blizzard? Was it supposed to change minds? What was the purpose of posting something people already know but don't agree with?
---
Oh my south park rly hit the mark last week.
---
for every wvw video you post you must draw a picture of your characters doing something quirky to balance out the karma loss, Its the only way. Bonus updoots for every quaggan in the picture.
---
&gt; this game's value is insane
---
As a relatively new GW2 player (even though I was hyped for GW1 and bought it when you could still see game boxes on store shelves) I have to agree with the value thing - it's absolutely nuts how much game I get for the price, whether it's the free tier or the expansions. My wife and I have been playing together for the past few months and it's been a great experience that lets us keep in touch with some old friends. Thank you for being a part of it!
---
You are most welcome everything will work out :) I’m just a simply Izzy and leaving behind a building full of amazing people who do amazing things every day
---
I'm totally for this but you're gonna get so much flak
---
did u make that T shirt man ? it's dope AF man , i want one , no i want 100 !
---
Allow me to add to the list of thank yous and say you are the best for doing this. Guild wars and it's community have been my favourite by far and this is one of the reasons why.
---
I can't wait to see what manaworks does next, best of luck !
---
I mean this whole thread is just a [repeat of 4 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bnxbir/everyone_else_learns_history_of_balthazar_me/), I'm more surprised this one took off.
---
Best of luck to you and everyone else over at ManaWorks going forward!
---
Since you effectively bought the game and left, I'm going to suggest you look over the [new player wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/newplayers) rather than the [returning player guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
In general, there has been a lot that's changed since you last played, but the core game experience should feel pretty similar. I'd honestly just pick up a character (maybe your old one, maybe a new one, up to you), and just run through the maps and the core story of the game. Do events, explore the world, finish hearts, all that stuff. That will help you really get reintegrated back into the world without throwing too much at you at once
---
I'd also recommend heading over to /r/guildrecruitment or  finding some friends to play with, because the game--while not all that difficult to start off--can be a little confusing with everything that you're doing.
---
People migrating from MMOs always ask that specific question. "What is the endgame like?". Only new MMO players dont care. But when you are a veteran and you know you're gonna spend hundreds of hours in a new MMO you always look at the endgame, always. You underestimate how quickly traditional players progress through their character, gear, gameplay and skill. 
---
People playing WoW have grinded their hearts out by this point to get top level,best in slot gear, multiple characters etc and that happens every expansion. Then they move to a game like GW2 that requires minimum to no grind and you even get a free booster that 8/10 people will use instantly. And thats it, you explore the world and do the story etc etc or you can just hope into endgame.
---
I recently created an alt account just for raiding and within a few hours of getting the basic masteries and mounts i was already raiding. Reaching top level in fractals and doing full cms and t4 would take a few weeks if i kept at it. Thats how fast you progress in GW2.
---
And [history repeats itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bnxbir/everyone_else_learns_history_of_balthazar_me/ena53ar/) lol
---
I can multitask at work. I really don't get the whole point of thinking playing a game for a certain amount of time and it not going where you want means all of it was a waste of time. I mean did you ever play sports when you were a kid that never got you a scholarship or became a professional player? Do you feel like all of those times were a waste of your time since they didn't go where you wanted?
---
That's why I was thoughtful, intentional, and careful with how I presented the concept. While I expect to be insulted, trolled, and otherwise abused for simply engaging in meaningful discussion of an important issue, I hope that people with constructive thoughts and comments will outnumber the trolls and haters. Thanks for your support!
---
If you actually spend 5 minutes researching the topic or actually talking to someone from Hong Kong you’ll know the situation is a lot more complicated than “Hong Kong riots good; China bad.”
---
And the discussion has no business being brought up in the context of an entertainment forum because any discussion about the situation will result in bandwagoning by people who have not taken the time to read about the situation.
---
I remember way back then, I was so angry at your balance and design philosophies. The way Smiter's Boon was handled felt unfair and I always resented you for it, often laughing about what I called balance failures with a friend, thinking I could do so much better.
---
Now I'm older, and wiser. I can see that not all balance philosophies apply to every game and the way things were done was a compromise between what needed to be done, what people wanted done and what could feasibly be done. I grew to respect you as a developer and as a person. You're, after a lot of time hammering my massively sturdy head, the one that made me reconsider.
---
Reading all your stories fills me with existential dread of all the times that were, and that will never come back.
---
I think I would cringe if this actually happened....
---
If you look in the original post here, there is a link for a returning players guide.  I'd suggest not deleting your characters, if you have any, as they'll have years of birthday gifts waiting for you!
---
&gt; I remember I wanted commander tag so much I spent 500 dollars buying gold (the conversation rate was lower) so I could be the first commander in the game.
---
Well?  Were you the first?  Don't leave us hanging!
---
So, what race and class did you choose?
---
I guess I'm an outlier then because I joined ESO not for the end-game. I just like the gameplay and leveling up.
---
I know that this will sound super corny, but-- it's true that you're just a simply Izzy like I'm just a simply Rev, but it is in that simplicity, those small moments over the years, that create truly meaningful things. Not everything needs to be grand to be momentous, and you helped create those moments for yourself and for all of us.  
---
GW1 got me through breaking my back and being bedbound for six years. For six years I couldn't go outside, couldn't feel fresh air, couldn't do much that was 'meaningful'. But GW1 let me do things, small but fun things, like coming up with the SS build before it was cool, like Ele/Mo and Ele/Rit in FA night after night and knowing my heals kept our team up and helped us win something. Victories, small victories. It kept me sane.  
---
GW2 got me through cancer, stage 3c. I was given months to live. I turned to this subreddit and to my guild, I got so many responses from folks at ANet. I think some of that carried me through 7 brutal double rounds of chemo and into (so far) remission. People might think that's pathetic, but it was just me and sweetie. Our real life families turned our backs on us so it was online support that meant so much.  
---
I don't want to make this about me, because it isn't exactly. It's how you and ANet have made something bigger than 'just Izzy' or 'just a game'. Small moments, big moments, it doesn't matter.
---
Thank YOU. &lt;3
---
I was lol
---
Don't delete your old character(s), they'll have seven years of birthday gifts saved up and will be earning more going forward.  Deleting them will reset you to the start with future gifts.
---
ahahaha i try to remember that ;))
---
Is a real life tp tax really that profitable for that effort?
---
I’m glad these games and these communities where there for you and hope your in good heath thanks for the kind words and stories :)
---
Good luck to you and I wish you all the best Izzy

Anet hasn't been tested in this manner I dont believe, but that being said they are in a much better position than blizz is now.
---
Thank you 💚
---
&gt;  brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public
---
There ya go.
---
All classes can solo PvE content, they all just have different playstyles to survive and fight. Just pick the one that introduces you most.
---
any good corporation will do the same. can you name any corporations that have condemned china for the riots in hong kong?
---
if only they looked half this good, I may consider play an Asura.
---
I'll see what I can do.
---
And you would need the skyscale.
---
I've been playing GW2 since beta and there's never been a major thing like what's happening with Blizzard right now. If anything GW2 I felt has always been more progressive than other MMO's with what they bring up in their story telling. I mean Russia got upset about some of the LGBTQ stuff in the game for example.   
---
I think if they were to make a stance on the HK thing (which I don't think they would but if they did) it would probably be in support of democracy. I can't see them banning someone from a tournament for that, it just wouldn't line up with what I know Anet to be.   
---
Just give the game a try, base game is free to play after all. Definitely play it with the expectation of buying the expansions though since that's where most of the end-game is at as far as PvE goes and it just gets better. You'd be just in time for Halloween as well which is an awesome holiday in GW2. If you'd like an introductory tour feel free to PM me and I'll help you get started.
---
I have no data to back this up,  but I agree that the tp tax might not be that profitable. There are other things that might make it profitable. Taking GW2 as an example. GW2 main revenue stream is probably the in-game gems store. If a player wants to stop playing GW2 and sell his account. A new user would buy that account and probably invest money into buying gem store items, which the user that sold his account would not do. 
---
Then again the issue also lies with if players sell their accounts among each other who would then buy new copies of the game itself, which might lead to a decrease in revenue streams.
---
What kind of value would one find in a GW2 account? 
---
If they wanted mass skins to play fashion wars without actually playing the game, they can already just buy the majority of them through gem&gt;gold conversion and the rest of them directly through the gemstore providing artificial scarcity isn't in effect for the skins they want. 
---
If they want ingame achievements that are hard to get/require effort, you can pay raid sellers for just about any of that (most of them will do anything, not just raids/fractals). I've also seen cases of people in my guild sharing accounts and paying gold/cash in order to do world completion and the skyscale collection.
---
I fail to see there being a big enough demand for this in GW2 for it to be worth Anet's time, not much that is of value that can't already be bought through gem conversion.
---
And frankly it just doesn't seem like something Anet would ever do, their happy rainbow image is all about having an identity in Tyria that is your own.
---
I'm indifferent to this idea but I do not see it happening in this game, ever.
---
Deal! When?
---
I see a dark stripe...
---
Not gonna lie, I've had dreams where I run around like this.
---
That's not what happened though. As a woman who believes in equality for all what happened was not an example of that. She overreacted and saw sexism where there was none, she was being really offensive and got fired for being offensive not because she was 'pointing out sexism' if anything she was the one being sexist.   
---
The guy didn't say anything wrong and nothing in what he said came across as sexist or mansplaining to me. I'm one of the first people to point out sexism in either direction if it warrants pointing out and I've had plenty of guys make actual sexist comments to me or tried to mansplain in the decades I've been in the gaming community but that's not what happened here. She deserved to get fired.
---
&gt; as well as a list of almost everyone with a security clearance (military, spies, gov officials, etc).
---
Your point stands but the information they breached was 5+ years ago and it didn't give them who has a security clearance, just those who had applied.
---
rofl
---
lighting  in this game can really alter the colors, but you never know.
---
it has really means a lot to say goodbye
---
Let’s not forget, GW2 uses the same engine as GW1, so in the least, traits/skills template code should be easy to convert and port.. since gw1 is still running, we know they have the code sitting around.
---
It's doing it's best.
---
Do you care about upgrade-ability? If not, then consider buying used and an intel a few generations back. The one good thing about intels slow performance increase over the years has been that you can get a fairly cheap  used rig that will play games like guild wars2  fairly well. If you do buy used , you need to be somewhat competent in pc repair just in case. Make sure to get something with a high cpu clock as gw2  really  likes single threaded performance,

---
Here's the thing - they don't care. NA is 55% _now_, but China is a _rapidly growing_ 12%, in the most populated nation on earth, with raising birth rates. 
---
They got pretty much peak market share in the US, which has a declining population. 
---
You're seeing a lot of NA and EU multinational make moves to not piss off that China market, also because they know our next downturn is likely to shatter the country with our political polarization.
---
recent collapse of integrity? have you just started playing their games?
---
If her politics are an indicator I'm sure she's cool with taking one for the team
