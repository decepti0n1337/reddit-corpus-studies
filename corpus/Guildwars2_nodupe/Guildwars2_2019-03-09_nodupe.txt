Bring back dungeon running for gold! No seriously I barely did them and missed all the sweet skins.
---

---
Guess there always wvw reward tracks....
---
Given the state of engineers through this games life, I totally believe that’s working as intended/nobody will do anything about it. 
---

---
I sure enjoyed the discount when I crafted my Leggy armor. As mat prices go up, gold becomes more valuable, so raids and pvp for instance are indirectly nerfed (since they give you raw gold instead of mats).

so im trying to craft Bolt vol. 1 and i have to buy something from scholar Nabbi in straits of dev, but he's not interactable anyone knows why? or how i can make him interactable?
---
TBH, I came from GW1, and literally the game is dying. Dying as in two out of three game modes, which are PvP and WvW, are not maintained. The other issue is that GW2 devs have been giving out poor quality. The LS (Living Story (Seasons)) are literally not worth the money to unlock. The main focus of the game has been gemstore, and they have not even been putting out anything of great quality there either.
---
Fashion Wars 2 is still in effect. Your character's aesthetics are all that matters, and the outfits are terrible from the gemstore. Lore wise, and combat wise, GW2 is completely different than GW1. They have been trying to add the combat trinity, but in most cases unless you are doing high-tier fractals or raids which are terrible in design, the support and tank roles are still useless more specifically toward pug groups...
---
Elite specs were more disappointing from PoF than from HoT. Anet does not really know how to polish them.
---
hi was my suggestion low effort cause moderator removed it
---
I liked the feeling of beating a zerg, especially when we were capping a green keep and a blue zerg came in and tried to steal it, it felt so good to beat them.
---
I dislike the battlefield being littered with AoE fields of death ( I think they were scourge but I'm not entirely sure) that appeared when fighting certain zergs. It wasn't fun having a massive swathe of the fighting area being off limits unless you want to insta die. 
---
A lot of the veterans were friendly, there was only one dude who was being a prick to new players but honestly that didn't bother me at all because I'm pretty sure he was just a troll, and a bad one at that.
---
I just followed the sea of people, the commanders I followed didn't link any discords or anything. 
---
Overall WvW is fun but the balancing issues were very apparent from the first zerg we fought, as mentioned above. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ancient_Orrian_Urn
---
yes, and it is very cute!
---
...but so this is!
---
From the wiki:
---
&gt;  However, sigils and some effects from utility skills stack additively with each other. For example, a Superior Sigil of Force (5%), a slaying Sigil (3%), a 10% trait, a 20% trait and the (6) bonus of the Superior Rune of the Scholar (5%) combine for a final damage bonus of (1 + 0.05 + 0.03) * 1.1 * 1.2 * 1.05 = 1.49688 or approximately 49.7%.
---
So to answer the first question, the sigils are additive meaning it would be #2 (5+3 during the day and 5+3+7 at night).
---
they should only get hobby horses
---
In fairness though that's a viable wvw strategy to combat the enemy. Roamers and gankers provide value by clipping tails. Much harder now. 
---
I mean, the game mode really shits on new players regardless. You have none of the ability advantages that longtime players have, you get reduced rewards pretty much across the board, from fewer pips to being unable to glide indefinitely to simply not having access to autoloot. The warclaw is obviously not an advantage to anyone who doesn't have it, but just the fact that it's so easy to get means that it's not long before even new players are feeling the benefit. I mean, in your example above, *only* four people out of your entire pack didn't have the mount, which was only released two days ago.
---
But the helm gives you 5 tickets when consumed, no? So you basically have "extra tickets" with no artificial maximum during the week :)
---
i know the item fam, its just scholar nabbi is not interactable.
---
but i think its because of the statue of grenth effect, but the thing is that the grenth meta has been completed tho
---
Oh, where does it say that? i checked the sigil page, but in its examples of equipped sigils it didn't include any with two passive sigils.
---
Ooooooh! I need to go check that out!
---
Asking for an item to be pay to win because you don't want to actually play WvW is about as low effort of a post as possible so not an abuse of power at all. 
---
Moderators have absolute power over the subreddits they moderate to decide what posts and users should be allowed. This post is not worthy of being on our subreddit. Any post asking for pay to win content would absolutely be removed for the same reason.
---
&gt; Map abandonment happens only because players don't play what they enjoy, but what gives the absolutely best gold per hour,
---
When every map is a carbon copy of each other, players will pick whatever is the most profitable. The maps aren't especially unique and there's an imbalance in how profitable they are. 
---
No cause if you read my post, if you even attempted what I actually did. You would see how long and frustrating it is. So yes it is absolutely an over the top abuse of power.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scholar_Nabbi
---
Look at the notes area. And if that doesn't work,  the next best thing would be to do this at reset when servers are fresh.
---
When you say you want to leave starter zones, are you talking about having trouble making much progress in the game? You can enter the pvp lobby and be (temporarily) boosted to max level with all core specs unlocked. There are training dummies you can practice on without having to worry about getting stomped by other players. That way you can mess around with the classes to find out what you like &amp; what matches your play style :)
---
The dyes and transmutation charges are easy to get a lot of, especially if you play a bit of WvW or PvP. Keys you can sort of farm by doing the level 10 story once a week, as well as dropping relatively frequently from map completions (about 20% chance for most maps). So it'd probably be slightly more worth it waiting for a sale on individual upgrades, though getting two of each slot upgrade for normal price and also getting some extra stuff thrown in isn't too bad either. Even if it's not too hard to get in game, you saved yourself a little extra work for free.
---
[From the wiki page on her](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scholar_Nabbi): 
---
&gt;She's encountered during the Help the Pact reach the graveyard outside Zaishen Antheneum event and is accompanied by Explorer Cammi, Explorer Borkk, and Scholar Lott. After being escorted to the graveyard, and after it is cleared of Risen, she will sell items.
---
So you need to do the event before she will sell.
---
get the 2step authenticate and retest. sounds alot like compromised account 
---
Is this confirmed somewhere, or just an idea?
---
Which is also inside another bag.
---
And some ambrite, which you have to salvage to deposit.
---
Had the same exact issue. You may want to go into the arcdps folder and open the arcdps.ini file in a texteditor (while not running gw2).
---
The first variable line should be hide\_all. For me this was set to 1, if it is, just replace it with 0, save and on the next start of gw2 arcdps should work properly again.
---
yea i know about the bugs the thing is that shes already at the graveyard and yes ive been waiting since yesterday and i thought i checked back today after reset but same thing. 
---
owh well i guess i just lucked out and prolly have to find a new map instance.
---
yeah. but then whats the point of upgrading the structure?
---
Makes more sense. I always thought ele was busted in pve (in its golden days) because of these since it has huge amount of modifiers boosting each other.
---
Very carefully? Lol
---
It’s so easy to get back into.
---
Buy it off the NPC that gave you the quest.
---
I think the concept for the movie Inception came from the GW2 loot.
---
2015 and im going to BOSTON BABY xD
---
What's "VM"?
---
the warclaw npc? it won't give me anything unless it the campanion achievement is done
---
Some would argue that's being honest. I dunno, I agree the banner was too much, but a sticky post maybe explaining the situation wouldnt be bad. Cause I've had several old guildmates text me about what's been going on.
---
Sad but true.
---
I only spelled out the issue and the reason why to get expansions if he wanted but not LS...
---
I mean sure, if you don't care about that stuff, wait for sales for sure.  Just wanted to offer it up as an option.  I, for one, appreciated it when I was told about it.  The black lion key farm requires too much time for someone like me.
---
Goddammit Jeff. 
---
Zerkers is still optimal in every fight with a competent group. As long as the healer is putting out consistent healing and the group is putting out like 40-45k total DPS on average (obviously with the help of Chrono+25might) while avoiding big sources of damage, there is no need to cheese these fights or your builds. It's probably far more effort to try and cheese a fight by killing adds and shit than it is to just have better DPS. The faster things die the less damage you take and the less time there are for things to go wrong.
---
The problems start when your group has horrible DPS or everyone's scrambling to save the person that dies 15 seconds into the fight. Sometimes as a chrono (my dps isn't gonna be sky high anyway) I'll take inspiration traitline to add some utility. But adding toughness or vitality isn't even close to the realm of ideas I'd consider to make fractals easier. If you're bad at avoiding damage, there's a good chance a few extra points of toughness isn't gonna change anything. I've seen reapers (the dudes with two health bars) be the first to die in a group because they just get hit by everything. And two health bars goes a lot farther than 200 points of toughness or a few trait changes.
---
Volatile Magic
---
Bought it. I despise Dry Top, so every geode is greatly appreciated by me. 
---
My inner Skritt wants to have everything in the home instance anyway.
---
Think what you may, I always thought they did a pretty good job so far on legendary armor. My only issue is that medium differs too much between combat and idle. Other than that, they are just beautiful.
---
You did a lot more than that.
---
Find a “RIBA” map in LFG. There was a post earlier this week detailing how big I can’t find if. This old comment is still relevant:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7ynxfw/comment/duj89pr
---
i looked in his account, couldn't find it, i saw it in a stream once, thats all i know about it
---
Fun fact on necro weapon swaps. The condi scourge DPS build doesnt really weapon swap. You just put main hand in set 1, off hand in set 2, slap a bleed on swap somewhere and "swap" on cd. If you want to, you can still grab a staff and pop some aoe stuff. Always feels fun to me.
---
Not everybody gets them.
---
Difficult, but not impossible. There are lots of players who have multiple children and still have scheduled time set aside for their hobbies. I understand that it's going to depend on each individual's lifestyle/parenting circumstances/work schedule, etc. and that may not work for you, but I really think people need to remember that it *does* work for some. 
---
I absolutely agree. I saw that same recommendation and thought it shouldn't be implemented. If people want the mount they can get it very easily by buying the expansion. If they want to play wvw and don't want to be left in the dust that will eventually be their only option.
---
I'm sorry if this is a dumb question but what does an account being compromised entail? Also how do I set up a 2step authentication? Thank you for your time
---
oh yeah i do lol
---
Neither of those are canon. What's canon is that asura find larger ears and foreheads more attractive. This has nothing to do with physical pleasure, it's closer to women with hourglass figures or buff/lean men. It's just a physical attractiveness. Though the larger forehead is due to the idea that means larger brain thus smarter...
---
the straw that broke the camels back?
---
They could fix the map exploits and reduce the number of dodges to 1 (+1 with mastery) to alleviate some of the other issues regarding mount burst speed. 
---
Perhaps the jump distance nerf could be implemented as a band-aid fix while they fix map issues in the background.
---
Found it. https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/awbxw8/2019_new_silverwastes_farming_guide/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Thank you 🥰

To be fair GPH is what it bottom lines to. 
---
99% of blues, greens, and even yellows and oranges are just trash to convert to mats to convert to gold. Same with map-only currencies like mistonium or unbound magic.
---
We're talking about YB not SoS
---
They probably did a copy paste job and it had some unintended consequences. Similar to how the gift of battle track was a modified  from the Balthazar back piece and then later modified to add more “legendary” crafting mats.
---
I know Wooden Potatoes has talked about a few metas in Orr that used to be great farms by letting events fail. Can't remember which ones though.
---
No.
---
One stack of stab, every 40 seconds (30 if reduced by alacrity).
---
By Ogden's hammer, what savings!
---
Yet one of the devs commented one time, "The rewards are pretty even yet WvW is slightly better".  Sure we might get heavy loot bags and lots of blues and greens if we play well but come on now.
---
It might be a lingering AoE effect Siax placed.
---
I recommend setting up your damage log and see if it appears there. 
---
I like it for WvW zergs. Little use in PvE. Decent secondary healer/support but definitely not meta. That’s my hot take.
---
And changed the hair, fur, and (although you can't see it) eyes, and name. It all was a very expensive journey. I just felt proud of finally making them better after bad fashion and a botched name change.
---
Sorry I thought you were just trolling me, that was my bad
---
FotM = Fractals of the Mists
---
I wish. I would have abused the hell out of it with my 2k potions. But unfortunately, the Silverwastes track cannot be repeated.
---
I just want to be a scrapper support in pve :(
---
My god do you even realise that you are doing what you are accusing me of? How do you know if they done research or not? How do you know if they understand or not. How do you know how they interact? How do you know how each person know and don't and what they are capable of? Your post is not only full of assumption about "them" were you are certain that what you think you know is the truth, but also about me were you feel you have the right to read in what ever you want and then tell me what i am and not. 
---
I have zero will to answer you ever again, because it is impossible to answer a person who feel they know everything about everything and noone else have a clue. That is not only a assumption but also very wrong. 
---
This is what happens when you add mounts to a game that was designed, from day 1, to never have mounts.
---
Things are gonna get weird for a while. 
---
OoooOoOOOOOOOOOOOooooOOOo, Kitty kill Krait and Kitty like fish like Quaggan, Quaggan loOOoOoOOOOOOOOooooooOoves kitty. 
---
Well, the dyes are some of the best ways to get the more expensive ones, the character scrolls are nice for weekly keys or altaholics like myself who actually run out of tomes. There’s also the fashion wars bit with the glorious weapons/backpacks/6th year armor!!!
---
If you don’t care about fashion, it’s whatever. However, there was a HUGE uproar from community for those that didn’t have the old characters for the bday gifts! Might as well have a designated character for birthdays!
---
I would love that mistfire wolf as a jackal skin!!  But it would never be given out as a gift.
---
Minstrels is a bit tougher to get than most stats. It’s either pretty expensive to craft, or it’s available from start selectable gear. 
---
PvP stat selectable gear is probs the easiest. You get effectively a free armour piece for completing the Byzantium pip track from playing ranked. You’ll also get a load of gold to help craft it.
---
If you do raids at all you can pick it up from the magnetite shard vendor, it’s either defenders or healers chests - I can’t remember which. 
---
Hi, what is (UGO) Unity Gaming Organisation, and Matcherino. please?
---
I was just about to type the same thing. I had this issue back in November and fixed it that way, and a guildie had the same issue last night that this was the fix as well.
---
What's the comparison to a 3 stacked Chain Pull (3 Warclaws) to a mastered flame ram?
---
Make it a rental that just gives the speed buff + speed buff in enemy territory so people can keep up.  It'd be nice if it was also pretty obvious of a vendor in spawn so people know.  Maybe put the horse there or something.
---
I spend most of my time in melee with my sword and torch/axe (I run an offhand axe in open world because it's fun and the quickness and rapid attacks help to build up adrenaline and stacks of bleeding from the arms trait, as well as proccing a lot of any pn-hit or on-crit effects. I know it's obviously not the optimal build, but it's fun to run around with). 
---
Remember kids, Asura are cannon for comparing ear size like dick size! And there is record of asura “padding” their ears.
---
I mean they are the new meta in PvP; they have all the boon upkeep, dmg, condis, blocks, and barriers than anyone can possibly damage against alone. The only time I've seen them die is at mid for team fights...
---
For PvE, it probably did not change a thing. Scrapper and most HoT specs were made for PvP because that is when they were pushing for esports... Combat Triangle still does not exist except high-tier fractals and raids.
---
I spent ages on my first birthday picking which dye thinking to sell it, it was ugly but worth about 160 gold. I have never used that colour and probably never will. Since then I just spend ages flipping through characters to see if there is a dye that would make their armor better before deciding.  The last one I picked was Charred since it looks great on furry mounts.
---
Before I bought I kept one main I kept progressing the story on and alted the other char slot almost weekly.  Good for Black lion keys at least.  Money carries across all of your toons at least.
---
Ahh, really good points. 
---
I'm recalling the grove backpack, from a year 4 birthday, IIRC?, loved that one. And.. I suppose if we didn't keep our characters (atleast some) we couldn't access these...
---
Shame about the confirmation on the birthday dyes, but thank you for getting back, appreciated! :)
---
It sounds like someone has access to reset the password on your account.. and whenever you change it, they’re changing it afterwards. I would add an extra layer onto this, such as others have said “two-step authentication”.
---
Basically, they can’t change the password, or even log in, without using a 6-8 digit code that changes to a random number every 30-45s nonstop. But, you can log in, as you have access to see what number it is currently.
---
It’s an “Authenticator”. Would suggest google or Authy as a phone app for one of them! Also, change email password (and do the 2step too), in case they have that!
---
Go to at least 10, play one of the 15 different possible character missions and get the key.  I think F2P still gets the key.  
---
The full/not full status is based on active play in WvW iirc, so already taken care of.
---
And given the nebulously upcoming alliance patch - it will go away as a problem entirely, so unlikely for Anet to change the current system before then anyway.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
No prob! Btw, for 5th year, you get another backpack, and your choice of two weapons. For 6th you get 2 more weapons, and the armor set (only one weight) iirc.
---
But deff keep at least one!! More will be more boosters and dye choices (which is why the market for some dyes gone down, such as electro blue and permafrost. People with a bunch of alt’s getting all the expensive ones without spending a coin!), but the achievement items are only once (backpack #1, #2, weapons #1&amp;2, #3&amp;4, armor #1).
---
Exactly what ANET did.....Players found something fun and enjoyable.  Anet says....."NO WAY THAT GOING ON ANY MORE"  and Boob bamb........NERF!!!!!
---
Atleast we've broken out of a condi meta
---
Every cloud has a silvfur lining they say!... \^\^ Glad you were able to make use of it!
---
I'll also admit there was a few dyes I'd just consume but think I'd never use....then alts would happen..and whaddya know? The shoe fits! :D
---
I aren't seen anything's.
---
In their defense, I too would like some sexy Asura clothes.
---
This is roughly the timing I found as well.
---
&gt;Why is everyone whining about GW2 on the media these day?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Although I like it somehow i can not stay to this game, not that is bad. 
---
Hmm, dunno m8
---
I wouldn't knock it till i try it 
---
Very much this. Player population doesn't have anything to do with the number of accounts on a server, only the active WvW population on a server. Removing all accounts a year old will change nothing at all. 
---
The problem with the alliance system, though,is that we don't know when it is coming.  I've been running a guild for years now without everyone being able to WvW together. Some people did transfer when the server was open but now that it's closed, we have more and more people who can't WvW with us. Because I prefer to remain inclusive, it limits the time we can spend in WvW as a guild. 
---
While I don't think Anet should change the system, it would be nice to have some clue as to when that alliance update is finally coming. I'd also like to know if it will include alliance chat like in Guild Wars 1. My guild is almost out of room for new members, and we started a second guild which we're leveling just in case, but without alliance chat it would be sorta worthless.
---
Skill 4 is vengeance. Bandages is the first skill and all it does is heal.
---
^^^^o/
---
The mists are basically the glue/extradimensional magic that holds dimensions and different worlds (one of which is Tyria, the PvE Gameworld) It's the aether, connects all things etc extradimensional fuckery. For the purpose of the game PvP and WvW take place in the mists. 
---
Please Please PLEASE fix the bug where you get stuck on your mount, can't switch weapons, revive, glide, nothing... 
---
The symptoms of brain damage is probably showing?
---
well boo, the anet support was no help, he said the exact same thing you did, and it didnt work for me&gt;_&gt; i guess worst case senario i just have to burn 40 hours and get it in wvw. 
---
With SAB coming up in April, and with the recent turmoil over at Anet HQ, I'm expecting to see episode 6 sometime around the first week of May.
---
I said it already, I'm open to discussions, seeing how I'm not a scrapper player, these are only things I see and think.  I would love to hear from a scrapper player what they think would be better for the spec.

&gt; Will they ever be worth anything in pve?

you can now complete 99% of all the pve content on scrapper, just like before the patch...
---
&gt; Is warclaw necessary at all
---
Since every game out there is set against looking like a Pay 2 Win, I'm sure the warclaw is unnecessary... Right?
---
Uhm, Right?
---
&gt; I think the concession is that unlike war if you don't enjoy what's happening to you in WvW you can just leave and come back later.
---
Surely the point of a game is to make you like what's happening, not to say "well you can stop any time you want".
---
* Warclaw [chain pull](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chain_Pull_\(Active\)) - 2k (and 1 supply) per pull x3
---
* [Flame Ram](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Flame_Ram) - 40 Supply to build, base attack of 4,144, can also apply [structural vuln](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Structural_Vulnerability) for up to 10% more damage.
---
* Superior Flame Ram - 50 Supply to build, 50% more damage.
---
Revenant is better in zergs, thief is better for roaming.
---
SAB will likely drop on March 26th and last atleast 2 weeks, last two SABs have been 3 weeks long. 
---
The earliest I’d expect the next Episode would be April 30th. 
---
I'd be pretty annoyed if they dropped the new episode at the same time as SAB, tbh. I like SAB and prefer to spend time there. But I like doing new episodes pretty fast, before spoilers make their way around and when the zone is packed with people exploring. I'd hate to have to choose between the two.
---
hello! im curious about wvw roaming, so was wondering if anyone could give me a TLDR or something about what it is about and your role as roamer. also an easy to get into roaming build?
---
Both are meta high damage roamers. You can take a look at more info and builds for [WvW](http://builds.vabbi.org/) and [PvP](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Conquest).
---
Hurray.. SAB without world 3 again. Hype. 
---
Would like to play new episode, but guess i will have to wait for my 2 hours of content even more.
---
Top 25's, Monthly winners, and a permanent pass from the recent Tournament of Legends. It's a pass that ports you up to an exclusive area which has access to a lot of features. I find it nice since no gems are needed, just skill.
---
I have a 99% Perfect Home Instance, the Contracts sadly like said cannot be shared; and are long to refund themselves, but they do give things you can resell at a point. The Black Lion Hunters Contract can be useful if you want potential daily T6 Mats (yes for T6 it is at best 2\~3 per day).
---
so, i followed the rather simple instructions but the ui doesnt show up, i binded a key to show on center, that i believe its the one it just be the default, but its only show a yellow dot on the mouse nothing more, no overlay, nothing

Does sandstorm switch from being a random game (with a losing expected value) to a non-random, fixed force loss after a certain number of roles? I did 55 rolls today and was lucky enough to be 1350 gold and 300 ectos up. Since that 55th roll I've had 19 minimum (25) gold rolls in a row. It could just be a streak of INCREDIBLY bad luck, but if I assume that the chance of getting the worst gold roll is, for example, 50%, there's only a 0.0000019 chance of getting it 19 times in a row. Such a ridiculous long shot that I think there must be some kind of cap where the probability distribution changes after a while. Anyone know if that's true, and if so, does it reset after time?
---
It's not though.
---
Sandswept Isles specimen chamber meta with max Karmic Retribution nets you 40k-250k for 15 minutes depending on how many people are there and how fast you can clear mobs.
---
I'm farming it currently because I used up all my Karma making Aurora.
---
It's a bugged sword skin.
---
It is possible to unlock it with wardrobe unlocks, I happened to get it shortly after they last updated them, which included this skin.
---
They might go up by maybe 10s.  The last time they were above 30s was on sept 22nd 2017, after that they started to drop even before istan was released..
---
..You wanted to ''match'' ? =P
---
Ah, you know, Seffii?
---
Hmm, well maybe I'm the odd one out getting unlucky with times of late. For what it's worth, I'm on the EU time, and try to get the 12am or 4pm ones. 
---
Off-peak hours: it's basically PvE where you'll occasionally meet another player or group of players. 
---
Peak hours: running in terror from blobs of emeny players, scouting ahead and reporting locations, acting as distractions to dwar enemies away or allow time for backup to arrive. 
---
Flip camps and towers. Team up with people. Do a little fighting. Condition cleanse is useful. Occasionally repost blobs on map chat and respond for requests for help. 
---
It would be nice. I usually check it in between certain bosses where there's downtime.
---
It feels like every 30 minutes or so, but my perception of time in-game is probably not correct. You know how it is lol.
---
Yep the comics are great
---
No clue who Seffii is, I just responded to the comment here.
---
For what it's worth, I've had the same experiences at all kinds of times of day, though not quite as recent for the times you describe. I've been dealing with some sleep issues that have messed my sleep schedule up for the past few years, so there was never any consistent time I was on.
---
Thank you
---
Did this solo on my PvE reaper build the other day.  Annoying getting in the keep yeah, but I eventually did it. 
---
On the other hand, the stupid Champ Griffon in one of the towers is the bigger problem.  Evades while flying, and it flies 98% of the time.  On top of that it heals when its flying.  Most BS mob I've ever seen.
---
Makes sense to me.
---
I'm down for this and I appreciate you adding this wonderful artwork.
---
My wife and also just created our first Legendary together as well, though it wasn't a weapon. We created Aurora the Legendary Trinket and let me tell you, without her, I never would have had the motivation and confidence to finish it. One of the best co-op gaming experiences in my life for sure.
---
Join a guild and do high level content things together like fractals/raids. It took me a little qhile to get into fractal but now I rly like it. 
---
My apologies, I got the impression that you knew Seffii.
---
... I do hope the MasterJediSoda's sleep schedule recovers \^\^
---
Guess I'm left knowing I'm not imagining things, but also not knowing who and who hasn't experienced this in any meaningful manner.
---
Either way, going to check out Sandswept, seeming viable for my purposes :D 
---
 I appreciate the response, but it was mostly spoken with candid. I *do*, however, have chronic suicidal ideation, among other friends. This situation has really not helped. 
---
WHO SPAWN TROLL??
---
Tell me more about the timeframe of your game time. Did you quit before the end of 2013? 
---
 
---
When did you return? 
---
Did you also receive transmutation charges from the transmutation splitter provided in your in-game mail?
---
Profitable yes but fun? That's gonna be a no from me dawg. 
---
I don't remember the name in particular but iirc it was the one that lead up to Arah. You just let champs spawn and fail the event itself.
---
...scrapper 
---
I have the same experience as you on EU servers, for teq you only need to be there 5 min early to be sure to get it, and often even less than that is fine.
---
totally unnecessary
---
&gt;One other QoL, while I'm at it - Make the locations ping-able on a ctrl-click, like waypoints - and bring the notifications into Map Chat too. This would allow new players can click on them in chat when they appear, to be shown where they are.
---
You can already do this for years
---
That's true. F2P do get keys, one weekly as well, obviously. 
---
Aww congrats!!! Yeah, if it wasn’t for my gf, I wouldn’t have had the motivation or confidence to do a legendary or the griffon collection! She’s really helped me deal with the stress and low self esteem I have from my brain injury, so her helping me do things I used to be able to do easily is great. 
---
Yay for supportive partners! 
---
Herald was fucking broken in the beginning. Top damage by just spamming autos. Oh and they were also meta for the 7-2-1 comp to buff the boon duration of the chronos.
---
Yeah ? That doesn’t relate to my comment at all though. I‘m saying they already have lore and rules established around these creatures, so changing them might be eh. 
---
they pushed the last episode because the studio is closed over the holidays, not because wintersday was on.
---
HoT and Halloween went live on the same day for example.
---
It's not about hiding, it's about moving on. Anyone can find the articles if they really want to. There's no need to keep reminding every single person about old news.
---
&gt;What use do you have for full counter in PvE? Interrupting mob #472's autoattack?
---
Magebane tether, attacker's insight, berserker's power? Like do you have any idea how warrior actually works?
---
&gt;Cool, what does it offer regular warrior dosen't?
---
Consistent boon removal and DPS. 
---
&gt;What use do you have for it in fractals without boons?
---
Why does it need anymore? It's good because it's the single best boon controller in the game while not sacrificing it's damage.
---
I'm glad you have someone as supportive as that! You're really lucky :)
---
Not a problem, all is good. 😃

Hey mate; very greatful for all the interest its having. The hardest was by far DH(the cc was very hard to hit,as shown, and the orb phase is rendered impossible without 35% movement speed from the instability (the orbs luckily are affected by movement speed and conversely are affected by we bleed fire etc.) With that being said, i ended up changing my chrono build to cut out its dps entirely to mitigate random fails and therefor despised every moment. (as per fractal spoons video, power chrono can have alot of dps).

I wouldn't expect it any sooner than May.

Raids, Festival JPs, playing ingame instruments (check gw2musicbox for songs), fashion wars for all characters, 2nd account, reading reddit or official forums, recently coded a raid boss kill tracker overlay. :&gt; 
---
There's things to do. But not to fill all your free time. Sometimes the best course of action is to log out to not waste your time doing something you don't enjoy.
---
I read the comments on this subreddit, it's often more entertaining than play.
---
how... why... I need an explanation or I'm not gonna be able to sleep
---
"Waste your time" for 5 tickets and 7 clovers! ....Obviously inconvenient if you were going for the Carapace armor, but 7 clovers are nice
---
&gt; Best Looking Male... Norn or Human?  
---
&gt;The  title said it all! From in-game, so many players are battling on which male norn or human looks more beautiful... So what do you girls  think??!! I'm curious to see your comment about your opinions or answers  and if you want, you can post screenshot of your male norn or human  to prove it also! Just entertain me or other people who are also  interested to see answers too as well!  
---
&gt;Me?  I personally like both and hard to pick one over other one to be  honest! They both just looks great to me but if I have to sacrifice my  life for only one... I'd say Norn! M Norn looks great with tattoo and  pretty meaty than M human xD and norn do have some interesting outfit  like heavy or med armor for an example since I'm into Norse stuff so  yeah lol  
---
&gt;No negative or anything bad here please. Everyone have a different view of point or opinion after all.
---
I was just curious to see how this looked. ;)
---
But since you asked, I prefer male Norn.
---
Have a great day!
---
Reminds me of that demon guy from the movie "Little Nicky" 
---
The worst part is when your butt clips with your armor.
---
7pm EST.  Or whatever that translate to for you. 
---
I get daily login reward at midnight GMT in EU server so I'd imagine it's that. Unless it's different in NA server?
---
Thx thats roughly 4pm my time lol
---
&gt; It seems that I'm running out of things to do
---
&gt; I'm not interested in PvP nor WvW
---
Not saying that's your problem, but when you limit yourself in a game that offers so much more than just PvE.  You tend to find out the limits of that 1 mode, and come to realize later on, the other game modes aren't as bad as people make them out to be.  Sure you have to play against other people, but it's not the end of the world if you die in a competitive game mode.  Besides it's a great time to get into WvW with the recent update.
---
Besides that, the 1 legendary weapon could be a start, there are so many more you could make.  You could get into raids.  Starting another class you've never played is always good, gives you a fresh feeling.  What I find works for me is coming up with personal goals that I know will take me a long time to complete.  Stuff like maxing out my material storage for every single item at 2k without buying them from the TP, or reaching capped gold.  Oddball things of this nature.
---
Yea its 7pm est which is 4pm my time according to anotger reply
---
Midnight for UK. Weird seeing as though the company is based in western America.
---

---
WvW and playing other games
---
Hell yeah! Heavy metal + Charr = Masterpiece \\m/
---
Why don’t you like PvP or WvW.
---
I don't really know what the confusion is here.
---
You encountered a bug -&gt; Report it through the game
---
You should have gotten something that you did not -&gt; Contact support to let them know and possibly recover it for you
---
weird as Greenwich (UK) is the reference that any other timezone is based on, huh? :D
---
Could you share your build? I wanted to try scrapper in wvw zerging, but have no idea how to build it. Especially what gear stats to choose.
---
I think I've never seen lightning in front of an open sky
---
Norn. wish there's more tattoo options though.
---
Im f2p and got it at lvl 53 from a chest I got from map completion...
---
they are cold facts for sure, but that's by no means an indicator of something should be on the banner or not. Those require more factors to consider than just their factual correctness; for instance: immediate relevance, urgency etc. etc.
---
Considering that, OP's call was, in my opinion, quite correct since the banner was up during a week in the community when the news was fresh and EVERYONE was talking about it. Since then, Anet made official statements, all the conversations were had, and the developers and the community moved on to a fairly normal pace and highlighting the warclaw.
---
Does that mean the news of the layoffs is irrelevant or over? No, certainly not, it's a continued story. But it barely needs to be any headline for now...
---
Oh, lol i've only been using this account since last summer xD 
---
Ah I see, so its okay for me to level my character through events? Will i miss out on much by not doing my personal story? (I hate doing quests)
---
Ok?
---
Have you put a point in the warclaw wvw mastery? Maybe going to Elvie the Warclaw Tender and buying the Warclaw helmet will fix it for you?
---
That's exactly what I want to see here on weekends. Thank you.
---
Used the Mount Warclaw in WvW frequently and got stuck in the character model shown in my video:

\- dont know what caused this

\- was able to beak the bug by changing map

I've been playing a long time... 30k AP... and have struggled to stay interested lately. I mix it up every day. I find out when guilds run metas, so I'll do Verdant Brink on Monday, Tangled Depths on Tuesday, take a break with some fractals on Wednesday, Triple Trouble on Thursday, Serpent's Ire on Friday...  that sort of thing. I love the precursor collections because they take you all over the world, so I'll farm SW for gold and then do a new collection. I'll set a goal for AP for the week (say, 100 including dailies) and find achievements to do. I have all classes maxed so I'll play different characters to keep it from getting stale.
---
I hate PvP but WvW is actually a lot of fun, so I'll run with the zerg once a week too.
---
using the boost once will not consume it immediately, it will allow you to see what a class is like at 80, thought it will be just the base class, no elite specialization. you then have to use the boos again to confirm boosting the class to 80. this means you can try out every class at lvl 80 with one lvl 80 boost until you find what you like.
---
No you'd'm'st not
---
The boost is the trial.  You use it, it takes you to a level 80 zone, and you can play with the class' core abilities like you were actually level 80.  If you find you don't like how it plays, you can undo the boost by double clicking it again and hitting Undo.
---
It isn't true. 2 chronomancers and 1 druid remains the best composition for competent groups. For those that need extra assistance then a support scourge or tempest or even druid healer can work fine. Despite how many people keep going on about Renegade and Firebrand compositions, claiming they are superior or at least equivalent we still don't have people sharing any logs actually showing that.
---
If it works for you, great. That doesn't mean it is actually better in practice, despite what people making claims based on golem numbers claim. 
---
I would love for us to finally have decent alternatives for PvE - it's been three and a half years. But we aren't going to see that until other professions can bring both alacrity and quickness and either other healers get decent might provision or druid gets nerfed and we use offensive might share options. 
---
Bought to you buy buygate, the server that single handedly ruined WvW. 
---
So if I go to a world boss that's in like for ex. a lvl 40-50 zone but I am level 60 will i be around lvl 40-50 too?
---
It's always at 12:00 am UTC no matter the change daylight savings time.
---
I prefer Human F just by the voice and the racial armor.
---
This could take years though.
---
I thought this was a baby announcement.  Congrats on the legendary weapons!
---
When your insult Arkk and he says "1v1 me, pleb".
---
&gt; used to use ectos until those crashed from Istan farming
---
That might change with the recent nerf.  We might also see an increase of t5 or t6 prices.  Considering lack of champs from GH, and Palawadan only every 2 hours.
---
Most probably not.
---
GH might be a selling point for next expansion if they'll ever release it due to the fact that they just need to design it and place the NPCs in it.
---
This gamr sucks! I've played for 3000 hours and there is nothing left to do!
---
Is there a simplified rotation somewhere? Preferably using Staff + Scepter/Sword, maybe with less focus on Wells as those aren't very realistic.
---
I guess it works like eotm where you can see the maps and objective colors, but you don't see any waypoints so you cant teleport to t3 keep.
---
tempestscrapper defense meta?
---
If you go into pvp (unlocked at level 2, so right after you get out of the first instance), you can also try out the elite specializations there before you use the boost. It won't be quite the same as trying it out in pve, but you still have some npcs and test dummies you can fight while seeing how the elite specs play.
---
Use the boost trial to try out the fully leveled core class in pve, and then get a feel for the elite specs in the pvp lobby if you want a more complete picture. You may find that a core class you weren't fond of has an elite spec you really enjoy.
---
I think they do not need to change the names, but maybe they could update the alerts with their locations (like north west, north, north east, east, etc.) [like this](https://imgur.com/a/CFxr77q)
---
PvE players: "Wow, this mound is glacially slow. Was this even worth my time?"
---
WvW players: "It moves like greased lightning! This is the death of roaming! Also we need 100% swiftness uptime as a squad and if you miss it it's your fault for getting separated." 
---
I can totally understand the reluctance in WvW for the mount and I think they should have put in a mount rental or something. It does create an imbalance between PoF players and non-PoF players, which I can understand but a way round it like with beetle racing would have been a better move, in my opinion. 
---
It's a cool idea, but there are definite balance problems that they seem to be working on reassuringly quickly.
---
Thanks for the post :D
---
You could us the boost to go into the class trial instance (which does not consume your boost) but I would say that the best place to try out your class is to go in the PvP lobby, buying all the different weapons the class can wield and then just try and discover things on the golems.
---
That’s not as cool as wandering in the Silverwastes but at least you get to try the elite specs and they change significantly the feel of their core class.
---
You don't need a 30min wait, you just need to arrive 5-10 min early,  not on time or after it has spawned.
---
I think Arenanet provides gems and vip pass prizes.
---
Would be nice if we could get a mount rental for guild halls that have built a race track. 
---
I’m excited to round out the season with 4 delayed episodes. The layoffs are heart breaking for sure. But another delay or two and I’m completely out. The game is so stale. 
---
I thought the first could were fun but it's veering into "wow, they really do have a thing about asuras and their breasts" territory. 
---
I wished we could have 2 weapons with engi so I could play hammer/rifle scrapper in open world. At least gyros have some use in PvE now (not speaking about HL fractals and raids)
---
If I remember correctly: there’s significantly less champions spawning each wave. From six every wave down to two in the first wave, and only one each wave after the first. Of course, this results in much fewer drops and does hit the farnabikity of the event pretty hard. 
---
You can also go to trianing golems in pvp to test pve gameplay.
---
Kept going, obviously. Oh. and got a second account. Kept going. Finally rounded out the races/professions matrix a few weeks ago. Now I only have the genders to add...
---
Melee Dragonhunter Longbow benchmarks when?
---
Hype up that true shot buff
---
No? It's in around 3 weeks. 
---
So ominous!! I loved it! 
---
Really helpful answers. Thanks. So I'll be able to select one the standard ones (probably go Berserker). Good.
---
Firearms, Alchemy, Inventions.
---
This build actually doesn't use scrapper. I've tried scrapper but it doesn't work as well. For scrapper you'd have to replace alchemy and lose books, but you can still cleanse condis.
---
Condi-support scrapper doesn't work sadly. Scrapper support only works with Power. Bruiser-Scrapper works with Condi, but you won't be able to support well.

hi OP, i'm sitting at just above 27.4k AP which means i'm better/smarter/more knowledgeable than you
---
that being said:
---
1) wrong
---
2) partially wrong
---
3) indeed, water is wet
---
4)see 3
---
5)true
---
6) totally which is why me being superior in AP to you means as i mentioned earlier that i'm simply better..hopefully one day you will reach my level of skill indicated by that number
---
7) no clue what this sentence means
---
8)an interesting statement about people not liking to be insulted..do you have any research to back this controversial stance?
---
thanks!
---
I guess at that point you just grab all the mobility skills to keep up. You only need to run about for a few hours (especially as a new WvW player since you get so many bonus chests) to get your reward track completed anyway, I really don't see this being that much of an issue.
---
if that worked it wouldn’t be a problem.
---
Damn, hold your sarcasm, you can tell he's a casual, he might believe you
---
How long did it take you to make it? I have everything except the final drop - the damn sword.. just buy gems maybe and exchange for gold.. my final  option 
---
^^^^stop

Yeah, this is probably it. The joys of copy+pasting in programming, they never lead anywhere good.

Wow great job! Those artworks look great

Did they move the supply hut in hills or something?  Last I heard guardian with GS 3 leap can get in.
---
I wish we could make SW money on literally any map that isn't SW.  The Lake Doric leather farm is decent money but it takes time to get a squad together and it usually flames out pretty quick; Istan was a great inducement for players to buy PoF and LWS4 as it meant a significant increase in their income.  Now it's just another map to complete.
---
Mike Z has said that Living world should be able to do things that expansions can so I would never say no. However I would only like one if we were in a different region so lets say episode 6 ends with us I don't know in the Blood Legion homelands because Kralkatorrik wiped half our forces out and killed someone our friends (yes this is still my speculation). I'd love a Guild Hall maybe Doomlore Shrine. 
---
The mount is already nerfed to the ground, don't even bother.
---
Piggybacking off your post there also is a problem with mounts where when you mount, it faces you in the direction of the camera instead of the direction of your player character. This is particularly annoying when you are trying to kite off enemies as it causes you to run into them unintentionally while mounting.
---
I will remember Istan buy one thing me farming 3k gems in 3 days to buy unlimited gathering tools.
---
R.I.P GH and Spamadan. &lt;/3
---
Yeah, server choice only affects your team in WvW. And that's supposed to go away in a future update (that's probably still a ways off).
---
Unfortunately for you, changing servers isn't going to let you use your characters names if they're already taken. I'm pretty sure characters names have to be globally unique even across regions. So even switching from NA to EU or the other way around isn't going to help with that.
---
If, for whatever reason, you still want to change server, you might be able to do so for free if you delete all your characters (but I'm not sure if this applies to F2P accounts, so maybe not)
---
Norn Female generally but a lot of armor looks bad on them due to stretching so overall Human Female can look better than Norn. You just have to work with the sliders a bit to get rid of the babyface syndrome a lot of Human Females have.
---
I did the Inquest backpiece as I'm a sucker for backpack collections (and good luck getting a non-Legendary Harrier backpack otherwise, if you don't do raids).  The gating and farming requirements for all the content that came with the current episode felt downright insulting - after shoving fifteen characters through thorough map completion I had enough materials for I think four or five exotic weapons, at which point I decided the collection wasn't worth the hassle.
---
The fact I have to run Thunderhead on the lowest possible settings when I can run the rest of the game on medium to maximum helped considerably.
---
Human Female Meta is on its way out. The new build seems to be minimum height Female Norn so they still look kinda Human but aren't.
---
I once made the max weight Female Norn and her butt clipped through every light armor I tried. Felt bad.
---
I've got over 4k hours in the game, spent most of October and November doing map completion with alts for 8+ hours a day, and I'm not touching that kind of grind.
---
It still feels half-cooked.  No amount of rewards can explain away the mesmer portal in town - the one that's just permanently *there* with no context whatsoever.
---
New guild related content? In Guild Wars 2? You mad man.
---
I found that farming ls3 maps and buying the magic wrapped bundles (the green tier ones, not the yellow) with unbound magic and selling the ascended items I don’t need works on getting a good amount of gold! After I crafted dusk, I would  sell the elder wood I farmed from these maps, refine them, and make about 15-20 gold a day! 
---
All in all, it took me and my gf about 3 months to make these. 
---
I'm not even sure if GW2 will get another expansion if I consider that anet lost like 1/4 of its employees. =/

---
Makes me regret my tiny eared human-ish asura.

Almost sounds Mordremothy. 
---
Your role as a roamer is to fuck up the day of anyone else roaming, or even better, anyone trying to return from their spawn waypoint before they reach their zerg.
---
Anyone who actually wipes in a zerg fight is usually a player with poor positioning + a group build who you should have no problem eliminating.
---
I'd probably go with a Vault daredevil (shit loads of evades).
---
Since you're usually operating away from your own zerg, call out movements of large enemy groups in map chat to keep your commanders updated.
---
&gt; The issue you mentioned doesn't even happen in wvw.
---
It happened to me once, when a loading screen took a really long time, so I guess I clicked before it was contested. But that's super rare.
---
It really does feel like pump and dump is a design goal.  Heck, Bloodstone Fen was always crowded.... until the sudden no-context buff to the ruby drop rate.  Since then the past couple of times I've been there (right after reset) it's been empty.  I guess because people don't have to hit every single node on the map for 0 - 6 rubies per run anymore?
---
Congrats! She’s going to be way cooler than you once she gets that astralaria though  ^^
---
On another note, I kinda wish that they made the sunrise pattern random instead of being dependent on the angle we look at the sword. We mostly see the orange part sadly, which takes away a lot of the visuals of the sword in general. 
---
Fractals is fine, this is raids that are being discussed though. 
---
its been in the wardrobe for quite a while like that; apparently something to do with raid bundles
---
This might help you: https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:WvW_Guide_For_a_Novice#Solo.2FSmall_Group
---
Basically, claim camps, kill sentries and take points, stop or defend pack dolyaks. Solo players sort of drift in and put of informal groups as roamers, so sometimes you'll be alone and sometimes you'll be with allies. 
---
For what character: whatever you're comfortable with at first. Roaming is more similar to to PvE than zergs. Range is helpful and defensive skills are more important than in PvE. Honestly, just go for it and try to take out a sentry or a camp. The best way to learn is to do. 
---
😂😂😂
---
I made Twilight and she made Sunrise. She’s my sun and I’m her moon. It’s cute and gay for us to have each of them lol 
---
You are making a lot of assumptions about me - I actually want to see different compositions, so no, I wouldn't say chrono is trash if it was just behind Firebrand and Renegade. I'd also suggest you familiarise yourself with the net changes due to SoI and the new Tides of Time - the nerf isn't exactly large and still doesn't make FB/Ren comparable. 
---
Seeing as you can't actually discuss without making personal attacks, that will be all from me. I'm not sure what I keep expecting from Firebrand//Renegade supporters. No logs shared, no evidence and instead just going down the route of attacking the individual (and arguing straw men) rather than the points being made. Have a nice day. 
---
Not so much of a TL;DR but there are different type of roamers really, some focus on one aspect while others mix and match: 
---
Duelers are mainly there to find 1vs1 fights with other duelers, usually you can spot them in Alpine Borderlands by the middle island north of south camp or around Stone Mist in EBG. It's good fun and nice way to get better at fighting other players. Some rules apply, such as not stomping after downing your dueling partner or stopping attacking if one of your friendlies decides to add in.
---
Scouts are usually running around the map (Homemap more often than not), checking whenever something gets contested and reporting in map/team chat about enemy movement, calling for help when your own objects are being hit. They usually build and refresh defensive siege, run dolyaks to upgrade keeps and towers and repair walls/gates.
---
Small roaming groups/havoc groups usually go around the map flipping camps, killing dolyaks, looking for fights, helping defending and attacking (while the main blob is hitting enemy keep they might go and stop enemy reinforcements or picking off players from enemy blobs tail/sides). Some are more into the PPT side of things, focusing on sneakily flipping towers and keeps while the enemy blob is busy elsewhere. Sometimes you see them in enemy maps upgrading/defending keeps and towers there, helping the main blob later on to have WPs in the map.
---
I prefer roaming over blobbing because I main a ranger which is more suitable for small scale action, but also because my pc is a potato and it cannot handle blob fights. Roaming is fairly easy to get into, make sure you have a proper build and class that allows you to fight slightly outmanned (For example necros dish out awfully lot damage, but they are not ideal for roaming due to their lack of mobility). Also situational awareness when to drop the fight and run! You need nerves of steel because you will get ganked a lot and blobs tend to chase roamers, so don't get frustrated when it happens! Respawn and try again, but most importantly have fun! :)

I don’t think she’s doing Astralaria for her sunvari, I think she’s doing it for another toon lol. I’m thinking about Bifrost for my moonvari tho lol.

I still think Twilight is cooler than sunrise but I like that sunrise is orange. But I’m also a weird goth kid lol

Because a lot of people like a sense of community and crafting a legendary is a great feeling, don't like it? Scroll on by instead of shitposting

Can never really have enough cats...
---
&gt;The exploit is artificially extending the event length to farm the bags instead of doing the fight as intended.
---
People were deliberately ignoring the boss for as long as possible to continuously spawn champs.
---
&gt;After months of it being in the game A-net decided they wanted players to move on to different things and because Itsan gave more rewards compared to other activities/maps. 
---
Anet has always intended for players to experience all of the content they release, and I think it's safe to say that they want all of the content to be rewarding although they often fail in many instances. You seem to be implying that they specifically make farm maps and then Nerf it just to force you to move on.
---
&gt; I'm talking about how you think Killing champs that spawn with a boss in an exploit, because it's blatantly not.
---
Killing champs is not an exploit. You are deliberately misrepresenting what I said.
---
&gt;This idea that Anet just doesnt want players to have fun or get rewards is ludicrous. 
---
Fine. I should have said ITT. But I never said you said that. Just that it seems to be a prevailing sentiment. But whatever, you obviously like to twist things around to fit your preconceptions.
---
wow you did the milk ear true
---
I think you mean Swainer.
---
I think you mean Swanir.
---
I've not been in a dungeon since launch, I remember them being pretty difficult? I admit I didn't think they were soloable.
---
I really like the changes, re-geared a medikit healer scrapper for WvW and holy shirt they can do an excellent job. Little feedback though:
---
* As much as I **_love_** new sneak gyro, I agree that it needs some visuak tell for enemies, like the old gyro and/or shadow refuge. There is no possible counter play as of now
---
* Toolbelt Skill for **Purge Gyro** is very... Lackluster. _**Very.**_ If they could change it to a more effective condition-relatef skill, it could get interesting, but as of now, it straight up sucks ahahah - a simple poison field on 25s cooldown!
---
* Not really worth mentioning as it's been said numerous times, but fix the 2 big bugs - blast gyro not proccing the Superspeed trait and bulwark transferring Walls and Gates damage to you
---
It seems the meta has a 45 minute cooldown. The timer on the sidebar shows up around 30 minutes after the end of a round (timer says 15 mins til pre). 
---
[These folks](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/scrapper/heal/) seem to think it's viable.
---
I've played since launch and I do not mind at all that they shake up things finally. What, 7 years of the same shit? Good on anet to finally do something regardless the form. Hopefully this leads into other changes.
---
Dungeon never were difficult. Most ppl just ran crap builds at launch. Since Berserker/Scholar meta, they are just clownfiestas
---
Better than having kids
---
"We plan to release living world episodes every 2 to 3 months" from the out of the shadows AMA way back in 2016 and Mike Z has never said this is over when he took over.
---
You almost never get a chance to start with 2 clones.  
---
Wouldn't a ToT WoR TW SoI opener be better? By the time you use SoI, ToT should be back. (Assuming you can take TW.)
---
I'm thinking WvW currency and maybe a timer rather than a single use (like, 2hrs to use the mount before buying another pass)
---
&gt;because stealth is very much needed there to speed things up.
---
You can easy run skip all trash without stealth
---
Yeah it's really easy and of you go at peak time you'll really find a group

I just finished Aurora 2 days ago.  My poor karma.  And gold.

Hahaha, maybe my launch guild were just bad? It's been years since I tried one, excluding the solo Arah for the personal story.

given the scores i'd say it's luck in your case

Any class, literally.

Max Karmic Retribution on any or all of the season 4 maps.  Do the meta events on said map, earn lots of karma.  I get about 27k from the Thunderhead Keep meta.

If charr evolved from warclaws than why are there still warclaws???

Guilds have guild commendations earned through guild missions that can be used on an exotic back piece, berserkers’ stats included

More like unpetrified Temple Guardians
---
If you are asking this you are probably new to the game so I recommend you play whatever you feel like it. Big dps can only really be seen on late fractals and raid, at that time you can just build a dps out of what you are playing (all class have at least one dps variant) or create a new with the sole purpose of doing dps on raid/fractal.
---
All deeps are around 32k benchmarks so play whatever you like

Swanir Lake.
---
I think it was 99CM. Specifically I remember getting wrecked while attacking one of the single krait during the control point event in the middle of the fractal outside the range of the red orbs. I was really confused because that I very rarely ever go down there, and the damage log didn’t seem to show that much damage coming in.
---
With a bit of drop luck and dedication you can bring it down two 2 days (or 2.5 without drop luck) when you go for the extra rewards granted for 8 Dungeon paths each day (would provide you with 10g + Dungeon rewards as well) 
---
&gt; Reward is big reason but not true core part of desertification.
---
you right the true core part of desertification is when gods fight amongst themselves and we were mortals pay the price. Just look at what happened with abbadon! I dont know of any other sudden or slow desertification in tyria. #notmywar #bringtheseabackbubbles
---
for completely inexperienced party, just bring a raid comp, kill everything, its trivially easy and not much slower, especially bc new players will fuck up the stealth the first few times.  If you go full chrono/heal druid/power bs/2 power dps its all a complete joke and you can ignore all mechanics which is probably the easiest route for new players. 
---
Copper fed, no question
---
Oh yeah you’re right. That’s unfortunate.
---
Asura, clearly. All you other races with your disproportionately tiny ears, being way too tall, and all that. Glitch, I bet you've all never even been part of a krewe.
---
&gt; So atleast 30 min+ wait, if I want to be fairly safe in the knowledge that my map will be taking part in the World Boss... So 30 mins,
---
you can do other things during this time. Play the tp, make food irl (reset lines up with my diner time), read reddit etc etc
---
Usually I check which one has been edited last. Some of my coworkers shouldn't get write access on servers...
---
ArenaNet uses lowercase when addressing races and uppercase for titles. It's how people figured out that the "Forgotten" wasn't actually the name of their race but a title used to address the group. We have yet to find out the actually name of the Forgotten's race.
---
Granted this was six years ago so it could be that they could have dropped this (I don't really pay attention to dialog in-game).

Charr Hero: Tyria Tour
---
Available this fall. One Charr guitar controller included.
---
rewards with such obvious permanent material values will simply encourage more bandwagoning.
---
my personal hope when shaman discovered the new region in the stream was, that maybe it would work similar to HotM; as a general lobby for WvW, with a lounge area people get temporary access to for winning the previous matchup and reaching a certain pip chest. this idea obviously isn't perfect either though.
---
There's a setting but it's never functioned for mounts
---
Scrapper falls apart when its met with condi or targeted by the opponent team. Stop trying to kill a potential meta class that is rising from the dead before it even takes off.
---
**Desertification:**  *noun.* the process by which fertile land becomes desert, typically as a result of drought, deforestation, or inappropriate agriculture (as in bad farming. Not lewd Sylvari).
---
**Desertion:** *noun*, from *Desert*. The act of  leaving (anything that depends on one's presence to survive, exist, or succeed), especially when contrary to a promise or obligation; to abandon; to forsake.
---
Just thought I'd throw that out there.
---
SM isnt a keep. If you find it hard on normal wvw maps, try in edge of the mists. You capture it the same way you capture everything else - destroy the wall/gate and kill the lord.
---
Warclaws evolved from charr! 
---
Following a Com and doing events as a Squad is not playing the game, gotcha !
---
I ran a race with it once and won.
---
As others have said, it depends a lot on what content you're doing, and every class can potentiall output great damage depending on how you build them, but my personal favorite for damage is Holosmith (Engineer elite spec). It's lots of damage quickly, with great cleave. It just *feels* really good to see all those numbers flying everywhere when I jump into a pack of mobs (this is using sword/pistol or sword/shield; rifle build with kits is also great damage but definitely has a different feel and playstyle). As a bonus, Holo's attacks and skills are really flashy and pleasing to me.
---
Dragonhunter (Guardian elite) is also a secondary favorite. It feels much less dynamic than Holo (to me personally, that is), but it also has great burst damage. I'm fond of guardians in general, actually, because they're really versatile and can do a lot of things depending on how you build them. The other elite spec, Firebrand, can do some really satisfying AoE damage with a burn build, which is really fun in open world pve.
---
I dont tolerate it. I enjoy it. But for those who dont enjoy it, just have an optimistic outlook moving forward..
---
Yeah. It is really sad that you get only one Eternity.
---
Removed comment,,,,reminds me of living in CUBA or CHINA or NORTH KOREA......OR THE USSR
---
Uhh... what?
---
While there's spirits that spawn from the mists, we don't know the origin of the spirits inside the warclaws, only vague mentions to the origin of the process of making warclaws out of armors and spirits.
---
All we know is that when an armor is properly put together, a spirit moves in an animates it. 
---
So the armor having horns could be a requirement because the original creature who spirit animates the warclaw had them too.
---
But that's just a possibility. We just don't know enough.
---
if you are done.. why do you even post in the forums AND here? how about just shut the fuck up
---
it's not funny?
---
Wow U MAD TODAY?  Someone spit in your cheerios?

There's not really a joke there though. It's just you acting like a bit of a cunt.
---
The brandstorm applies a debuff called [Fury of the Brand](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fury_of_the_Brand), I'd definitely recommend looking it up now that we all serve our Benevolent Lord and Savior, Kralkatorrik.

WTF?

Thief? Large scale? How?
---
Obvious Eurotrash comment here
---
guess i dont have a sense of humor either
---
You miss the point
---
And what kind of sense of humor is this?
---
15-20k crits on staff 5, dagger storm. It's quite squishy and reliant on having lots of stability (and boons to cover for it).
---
[Definitely a sword.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azZRa6Hc9zI)
---
Yeah, my luck just plain sucks :)
---
I completed it for the clovers and the tickets. For players who finished the carapace armor this might be worth it now. For everyone who got the wrong chest but was going for carapace - contact support. They will help out with things like this.
---
This is not funny and is it impossible to be seen as sarcastic.
---
Here’s a tip for you. Please just try and act a bit more normal in life, people won’t bother you so much.
---
There was nothing funny anywhere in this.  
---
Also sarcasm doesn't translate in text. (though there was no remote hint at that with this. )  
---
I love that classification XD
---
Well, that sounds incredibly boring. I like these places having names (and not everyone defaults to saying "Blue Garri" etc. either, by the way). It's an immersion thing. 
---
It could also potentially be really confusing for newbies with anything outside the garrisons, What if Blue North Camp is currently controlled by Red? Does its name spontaneously change to Red North Camp, then to something else when it flips? Even if that isn't an issue, it would *still* potentially be confusing because it's a lot harder to keep similar-sounding generic names straight in your head than it is to learn to equate "North Camp" with whatever the name of North Camp in that particular map is.
---
You're asking for something entirely unnecessary, IMO. If this were a proposed solution to a problem, I might be more inclined to consider it, but there's no problem here to solve -- this is literally the first time I've ever heard anyone propose this. Vets know what they're talking about, newbies catch on just fine. Why water things down and make them more generic and bland if there's literally no useful reason to do so?
---
Well there are people who do. So yea.   
---
That doesn't excuse this. 
---
the alliance system will change the mechanics and organization behind bandwagoning, but won't stop it.
---
as i already stated, a lobby/lounge isn't perfect either, but it gives people something to wag around without encouraging bandwagoning straight out.
---
Hang on, didn't humans evolve from rats?
---
^(And are we siblings from asura then?)
---
neither do you.
---
Imagine how fun it would be if Charr could actually transform into Warclaw and others can mount them into battle!
---
Pretty sure that's the joke.
---
Worth noting, all ascended weapons, even spec weapons or Caladbolgs, can be stat swapped in the Mystic Forge.
---
But what if you bring a whole bunch of scrappers, protecting each other?
---
And some ash. But we’d rather not have people know. 
---
So cats are evolved Charr ?
---
Hey GW2 guys. With all the attention right now on WvW, I figured it might be a fun time to upload this little video I've made over the last few months showing some good ol' fashioned core D/D Roaming gameplay. I hope you all enjoy. :) This was all recorded pre-Warclaw patch.
---
I honestly can't understand what you're talking about here.
---
I use LFG every single day, usually for HoT metas, sometimes for bounty trains or HP trains. I also directly squadjoin on commanders every single day, when I happen to be on their map already (often happens in WvW, or when one appears and announces a bounty or other event on a map I happen to be in, or any number of other circumstances).
---
I may be misunderstanding what you're complaining about here, but your wording is really confusing and your meaning is unclear. I can't decide if English isn't your first language (if it is, I mean no disrespect -- you're obviously fluent but perhaps not quite ready to convey complicated concepts yet in a way native-speakers will understand), or if you're just someone who's trying really, really hard to sound smart and use words that they don't really have a grasp of yet.
---
Is chain pull affected by vuln?
---
You get more skins, but less legendary weapons. Honestly I'm pretty excited for the qol. 
---
I have [a PvE chronomancer build that focuses on blinding the enemy as frequently as possible](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQNAr+fnsIaRka00oZlaK1wCNFaQAqMRLvGV5E0bBHaAkTHR9wmsPLA-jxRSQB+UJYu070TlfAY/hn9gCSm6PF7kAEPIAYCpqVVqqqKpA2d4G-e). It sacrifices damage to have 100% uptime on Alacrity and Quickness so that it can spam shatters as frequently as possible, which inflicts Blinded via Blinding Dissipation. It also packs plenty of interrupts to trigger Ineptitude.
---
I chose the scepter since it can very easily produce three clones before Mind Wrack recharges (even with Improved Alacrity and 100% Alacrity uptime). With the scepter and Blinded Dissipation, condition damage seemed to be the obvious focus. So with the condi + boon direction, I mixed Diviner's and Viper's stats. I could probably replace the Illusions specialization with the Domination specialization and replace the Viper's stats with Berserker's stats for a power DPS build that would do better damage, but I haven't explored that yet.
---
In any case, it's clear to me that the build wants be the Delayed Reactions + Danger Time build.
---
Norns have better cultural armor, better unique hairstyles (both default and from style kits), awesome tattoos, and look like they can actually wield a greatsword / giant longbow. 
---
Visually they work best with warriors, guardians, rangers, and necromancers (IMO) 
---
The only downside is the voice actor. Not because it's deeper, but because some of the unique lines are a bit corny. 
---
The high DPS in (instanced) PvE is rifle Deadeye which has a horrible rotation, no cleave, issues with body blocking and terrible utility. It is used infrequently in raids because outside of hitting a golem, it kind of sucks. Daredevil is fine for damage when you can use Magnetic Bomb but otherwise falls behind Weaver, Dragonhunter and power Chronomancer.
---
If the OP is finding it difficult to do open world, the answer is pretty much always that they should be using Invigorating Precision. 
---

---
There you go, the open world bounty hunter killer tank.
---
The only things I haven't been able to solo with this are a few world bosses and upscaled timed bounties like PoF legendary bounties.
---
The rest all go down with this without the character even getting a scratch. I can't count how many legendary executioners and bloodstone-crazed creatures I've helped people kill with this.
---
You're a sweet cupcake 
---
But Charr havnt even evolved to begin with...
---
MAKE ASCALON GREAT AGAIN!!
---
Get copper-fed, if you are really that desperate for bank space you can use a character you dont play often as bank until you get bank space.
---
I did that collection 2-3 weeks ago and had no problems with this event. 
---
It started at Kusini Crossing like the description says and after the refugees arrived I automatically received the recording.
---
Maybe the patch broke this part of the collection? 
---
what kind of stuff does silverwaste provide? materials?
---
also what are t4 dailies? thanks
---
I'm not sure I'd call playing rifle Deadeye playing Thief properly. Compared with Daredevil and dagger/dagger Deadeye there are better options for both single target and multi target DPS. 
---
That was a lot of work, errrr, play. Congrats!
---
T4 means fractals 
---
lmao
---
Breakfast dude....breakfast
---
Cool, we are on the same page
---
NO U
---
These look great! 
---
Well, maybe now that the entire company is (supposedly) focused on the game again, someone will think to do something about that.
---
Congratulations!
---
You'll probably find a commander. Generally any bigger objective is hard to solo if you have no idea what you're doing, especially on desert border/eotm. It's quite trivial with more people though.
---
Several content creators have already been submitting reports, so It'll probably get a fix after the weekend.
---
Such a nice adventure there! Gratz for both!! Emjoy!
---
they will increase the cap eventually, you can always store some bank slot expansion items
---
idk druid makes aether so much easier, a completely inexperienced party can pretty much sail through it with no knowledge with a druid.

If you are playing on EU and have approx. the same online time like me, i can carry you through TA with a friend of mine. It is really easy.
---
DO YOU THINK IT'S THAT EASY TO SUMMON US. DO YOU REALLY THINK OH YOU THOUGHT WELL GUESS WHAT IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE'RE AREN'T ACTUALLY HERE WE'RE SOMEWHERE ELSE ENTIRELY.
---
Honestly, the way I learned everything was just to start roaming. I never understood how WvW worked and reading about it didn't help. At the same time, I have always been a PvP player in other games but never really liked GW2 PvP and for whatever reason really like the PvE gearing/crafting/buils systems in this game. I saw WvW roaming as a way to get some different PvP in this game AND make use of all the gearing and build stuff I like in PvE. 
---
As I roamed I would occasionally wind up running into a zerg or a smaller group and joining them as they did something and learned things that way far more easily than I think I would have if I actually sat down and "tried" to learn it.
---
This is homosexual 😘
---
Just like you lol 😘
---
This was never about vanity, though. If I only cared about the skins, I wouldn’t have made the thread or tried to put in a ticket. It’s the principle. I crafted them, I put in the work, time, and the gold.
---
Just FYI, if my math is correct, a new player would have to play 24 hours each week in WvW (averaging 5 pips per tick) to get diamond. Even many veteran players would be looking at 15+ hours of wvw. I don't think we should gate rewards around time.
---
Also, this would doubtlessly encourage AFK pip farming.
---
What is copper fed?
---
If you can find your CPU specs, they sometimes will give what the safe operating temperature is. Otherwise, 45-50C is normal under load. 60C or above is too high. The numbers for RAM are usually about the same.
---
Graphics cards usually run much hotter. Anything lower than 80C is fine.
---
You can probably Google your hardware for more specific numbers. 
---
That pocket raptor looks like it really wants a surprise buttsex
---
Yes. Besides doing the story, you can buy a portal scroll via the Volatile Magic npc. This can be said for other living story maps too, but if you have enough Volatile Magic ( I think 1000?), you can portal there instantly with any character. Otherwise, you can use a Teleport To Friend. 
---
Totally needed one of these for my 2nd account.  Bought it.  Thanks!
---
Is Fakir their favorite character?
---
Here is an original review I wrote about the Windswept Haven, which IMO is the superior hall. 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/72kmaa/my_review_of_windswept_haven/
---
In my list of cons I will have to change my opinion about The Access and The Compatibility because I have found ways to glitch into the locked buildings and this hall is incredibly good for decorating now that they added the Race Tracks.
---
Windswept Haven is the King of halls.
---
But you're doing the math with 100% bd
---
Two doesn't scale that we'll with boon duration, so  if you get both chronos to bring time warp you can pull it off properly at about 20% boon duration assuming proper stacking.
---
Also I really don't think the 12 % number is very accurate because double well usually always takes the number up.
---
Also I did read elsewhere that you need at least 38% bd for double wells to work without timewarp, which makes sense to me because the number before was similar, let's not forget bringing mimic also lets you bring disenchanter for that omega deeps greed
---
Is literally and empty armor fulled by magic, I repeat, magic
---
If anything it were Flame Legion weapons and thats about it
---
Grats on somehow knowing the exact, almost verbatim argument they're referencing and still not getting the joke.
---
Sounds reasonable to me.
---
And once I portal there I get the waypoint etc? I've been gathering some volatile magic so that's good to know. I did "all or nothing" i think i may have misread the wiki.
---
True true.
---
I'm a bit spoiled with ascended weapons so I'd just keep two or more gs's in,my inventory.
---
Support core mesmer is not a thing
---
You would be a low dmg, low support, full useless, class
---
Why 2020?
---
August and September have yet to happen this year.
---
First legendary after 4 years, congratz! 
---
That’s not a Norn, though. That’s a fully corrupted Icebrood, a minion of Jormag
---
I hope for the alliance system to prevent bandwagoning, or at least make it unprofitable for those partaking in it.
---
E.g. If you switch fraction during an active link (should be 8 weeks each iirc) you won't get placement rewards in the end or if you fought most of the linked time for the "old link" (e.g. At least 6 weeks) you would still get the rewards they unlocked.
---
So if we get those 8 week matchups there should be weekly and total matchup rewards, so everyone who qualified gets (possibly via wvw-ranks/week as mention in another reply) a reward based on the single week match-up placement and then, if he qualified for it as well, the reward based on the placement over the hole link time. 
---
Yeah..though the Thunderhead portal takes you to the middle waypoint in the map instead of where the map begins and where the NPCs are. I wanna say it gives you both waypoints from the middle of the map and the beginning (top left)..
---
Everyone stop capitalizing "charr" every time you mention it in a sentence. They aren't a Pokémon, they're a race. You don't go around talking about Humans, you talk about humans.
---
Ah, my apologies. I should have clarified that the "missing the event" meant the xp and reward track boost making it harder to claim later on. Reading it back I honestly should have written it better and it just reads like I have no idea what I'm saying.
---
In addition to the other advice you've gotten, I recommend using culturally-specific or other in-world job titles to get the names you want. i.e. a sylvari might develop into a Warden so instead of Caerys it would be Warden Caerys. You can get particularly good with Asura names. They're usually short and, if it's taken, you can add something like Arcanobotanist or Lithomancer or Psychomodifier before them to get it accepted.
---
Lost Precipice is the Guild Hall I fell in love with when they were first added to the game and while Windswept Haven is certainly cool I still prefer LP. I just like the overall coherence of it all, Windswept is so oddly laid out (to me at least :) ) and yeah as someone pointed out even if you upgrade it a lot of it still just looks to be in shambles.
---
King Adelbern did nothing wrong.
---
I always wrote all races with capitals letters, same as pokemon due each pokemon is a race i assume

I definitely love copper-fed for Fine and below, there's just so many of them. Used to use it for Masterwork as well, but now that salvaging sigils is a thing I use Mystic kits for both Masterwork and Rare. 
---
Lost precipice! The hidden zone and "extension" area (both accessible with mounts and/or clever use of decorations) are really nice!
---
Very nice
---
TOO CUTE!
---
I love your little warclaw, Chronocyde!
---
Oale Tree, Trahearn and Faolain. I'm curious of their colors :)
---
The shield is just the aegis effect. She (my character, the golden one) is a guardian. 
---
Well you can only get them from WvW, which means we can blame Mists nonsense. 
---
Were*
---
Thanks! I am going to try it out!
---
Yep. I see nothing wrong at all with a game pushing people towards buying expansions. You can call it pay to win or whatever you want to call it, but at the end of the day there's already plenty of benefits that people who have expansions get over those who don't have the expansions.
---
Those same people could be left in the dust on plenty of PVE things and nobody has complained yet. Those same people only have a couple of remotely viable PVP builds and yet nobody complains that the expansion specs that are available are generally stronger. 
---
Which I clearly mentioned in the end of my post😂 guess reading comprehension isn’t your strong suit 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
seems like you have no sense of humor i guess
---
Depending on inflation its worth more paying right now than waiting 2 more years!
---
My warclaw friend canonically loves me. My charr friend is incapable of affection. Ergo, they are unrelated.
---
And y'all forged 'em while I was asleep. ;)   Grats again!

I daredevil around, outrunning warclaws with dash and shortbow. So in this specific case it's no difference. But you do have a point. Good thing warclaw speed compared to no mount isn't too high so hope it won't be a problem.
---
Scrapper doesn't realy fear condi.
---
About 4 months. (I'm the gf) 
---
Well congratulations!! Very well done!
---
I'd love to see other mounts concepts.
---
PvE = Raids and fractals for the purposes of meta discussion dood
---
This is beautiful honestly.
---
This is more of a zerg build where scepter is just bad. If I'm playing suboptimal build I'd rather keep it somewhat useful. 
---
There's been some skins datamined that have no helmet and other armor pieces missing. It's basically an overgrown cheetah.

And yes, you can preview the skins in-game.
---
I like this one better.

That actually makes sense I've been worrying about that a lot
---
We think so too 😇
---
Thanks! My gf has been playing for less than a year OTL
---
&gt; I have long suspected that 90% of ~~early~~ *all* game code is spaghetti.
---
Chief...
---
I found it on the wiki.
---
\o/
---
That's why I'm suggesting to give rewards based on gained WvW-rank in the given matchup time which isn't offered while afking (AFAIK). And I know 5-15 are really low, but it was just an example. 
---
Oh Jeah druid for a casual aether sure 😌
---
Thanks, I didn't know about the free transfer. Maybe he did click somewhere he wasn't supposed to, despite claiming otherwise, and didn't know what he did.
---
Don't forget old and new Caithe.
---
Wrong sub
---
And yet, you agree with me - it is *behind* in raids. So nice try with the personal attacks, bring a decent argument next time.
---
In [Estate of Decay](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Estate_of_Decay#Waste_Hollows) of the Personal Story, Galina (who is a mere legionnaire) bets she can shoot a risen chicken for 10g.  In the [moa escort event](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Escort_Moa_Trainer_Kappa_and_her_pygmy_moas_to_Beetletun#Dialogue) in Queensdale, the moa trainer sells her pygmy moas for 1000g.  Neither of these people are significant people in the world of Tyria.  Who knows how much money Canach made on his casino bets (I don't think he ever said). 
---
 I've always found that the commander is laughably underpaid from a lore perspective.
---
Yeah you’re guess is as good as mine. I doubt he transferred without realizing it though. It has several confirmation screens. Just have him reach out to support, they can more than likely see more than you or I can. 
---
I kinda prefer the "Warclaw early design.jpg" design
---
Looks much more intimidedateting
---
For World Bosses if you already did one boss, can you do another and still gain rewards/experience? 
---
This comment makes me feel good about having about 80 gold on me at all times
---
Yah you completely lost the plot. I look forward to seeing you gone.
---
This is great news. Thank you
---
These are awesome! I can't wait to see more!
---
I just finished the main Path of Fire story. I heard something about a quest that can eventually get me an item that allows me to teleport to certain locations within the Crystal Desert region. I figure that's the next thing I should do, but I'm not sure where to start?
---
Yes. It's not uncommon to see world boss trains in the LFG where a squad will hop from boss to boss to boss.
---
Some of them only drop one reward a day, but that won't have an effect on the next one it it's a different boss. 
---
So then 5 gold would be seriously underpaid? I'm thinking about this contract being a setup, so his pay should be higher than you would expect for rescueing 3 - 6 captives (one of which may be high ranking Sunspear).
---
I don't know, is 300 gold excessive or too little?
---
I bought the ultimate edition like 10 hours ago and the gems still haven't come through feelsbadman
---
Where can I get that sweet dagger skin?
---
Thanks mate!
---
Ok so. I will 100% AGREE on this.
---
Is this hell?
---
I see what you did there.
---
A 10 minute video about "Don't use your bank or unlocked skills"?
---
You don't have to consume them to count for the collection, but there's no reason not to and your get sweet karma etc for doing so
---
looks about right
---
I’m sure Anet knows about it, but I hope and prefer that they fix the gameplay related warclaw issues first.
---
I don’t even do WvW primarily, but IMO those would be more important to fix.
---
I mean first of all you should know that if your guild mates ignore or even insult you you should probably consider leaving the guild. If you want to improve, do it cause it is really what you want to do and not cause it is forced on you by other people. There are other ways to play the game as well, without having to be a pro in any game mode.
---
Regardless, if you still want to improve, there are lots of guides on youtube about pve/pvp/wvw that I'm sure can help you get better. You should maybe try out an easy class at first (for example, thief in PvE is very good and very easy). Don't just give up because of some idiots insulting you if you really like the game! Good luck.
---
My dude, gilded hollow is the best
---
The guilds aren't insulting me....just ignoring me
---
Haven’t played fractals, raids or wvw. But there is more to this game than the competitive aspect.
---
Then play the other PvE portion? You know. The large, more casual part of the game. The portion that isn't the 3 things you're trying to do, that seem to be the cause/attributing to whatever your feeling.
---
Or take a break and play another game. 
---
Yea, same thing really. Feel free to try and talk to them of course then, it might be a missunderstanding, however if they keep ignoring you, it is better for you to search people that like you as a person and not because of how good you are at x thing.
---
Going to a pay to win model would prompt a massive outrage and could actually kill the game I think.
---
Keep your original character, it's a lot of fun to reach new levels, and skills are easier to learn when you get them a little bit slower. That experience of learning new skills and new areas only happens once,  you don't have to rush through everything. 
---
but, 
---
make a new character and jump right into the new content with the boosts. You may want to unlock mounts(Path of Fire) first, and then head into the jungle to get your glide on. Additionally, you earn hero points faster in both expansions (each hero point challenge is worth 10pts) so you'll unlock abilities faster there too.
---
Mounts and gliding are things you unlock for your entire account, so once a character gets them, all your characters have access. 
---
Technically you can do it all on one character, you can pause and restart different story chapters/ and go back to the core story or living world when you want.
---
And, you may spoil bits of story by going out of order, but there's enough going on in the game, you may find yourself replaying things with another character which after you've played will remind you why one thing happened or a character said that thing. 
---
Sometimes these purchases can be investments in and of themselves too.  If you can make use of the space now until August 2020, may as well buy it now and earn the difference.
---
In the end it’s down to each individual’s self assessment of if the deal is worth it or not.
---
Lost Precipice for sure. It has ample space, plenty of nooks and crannies to decorate and explore. LP gives you a lot more creative freedom than the other one. Plus if it's the Elonian aspect that you're after, adding Elonian decorations definitely spices LP up to be a better hall than Windswept Haven would ever wish to be. There are many places where your guildmembers can decorate for themselves as their own "home", plenty of small buildings dotting the place.
---
Windswept Haven is small, there is little room for creativity as most of the flat space exists around the buildings. There is little to explore, little to find, it honestly feels like half of a guild hall. When it came out, I had gold saved to switch my hall to it, I was excited. I checked it out in another guild I'm in that has everything, including the further exploration, I was really excited to see what the extra area was.
---
Boy was I disappointed.
---
There wasn't one, except for a path up to some floating room. There wasn't a hidden door that opened into a ruined interior of one of the sunken buildings,  or an interesting cavern. Nope, nothing. I promptly spent my gold on an upgrade for LP instead. At least it has character.
---
Does the button to buy even appear if you're already capped? I thought it didn't for some things.
---

If humans evolved from chimps then why are there still chimps???
---
looks like goku in anything related to jumping
---
Search up silverwastes RIBA guide. Find one that talks about lvl 53 bag openers too, if not it’s not legit.
---
In the Order of Whispers story step [Stealing Secrets]( https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stealing_Secrets) pirates want 100 platinum (1 platinum seems to be 1000 gold) as ransom for a rich minister's daughter. 
---
Using race terminology like that has always varied. Even SWTOR doesn't make up its mind in that regard. It heavily depends on the writers and the people in charge of typing these things down for the game itself. I mean, typos are still present in GW2... or even sentences that are not affiliated whatsoever with what the actor is saying. 
---
The moa trainer is 100% trying to milk the carnival for all its worth. And the bet Galina made sounds like a "I'll bet you $100" kind of thing.
---
Alternatively, when Demmi is captured, the pirates try to ransom Caudecus 50 platinum. Platinum = 1,000 gold per gw1. Comparatively, you'd charge no less than a few hundred thousand for a proper ransom, if not a few million.
---
"raiders" aren't "responsible for what ends up being the meta" though. That's the intrinsic function of game balance. Raiders, researchers, benchmarkers, and content creators simply *follow* and *discover* what the game's options are hiding. 
---
In fact, even within raids, different things are optimal in different metagames. SC builds and compositions are ideal for speed clears in high coordination groups of top tier skill levels. Double healer compositions, DPS classes with forgiving rotations, and other things are absolutely "meta" in groups that can't count on coordination or overwhelming player skill, but want their kill on the first pull.
---
Releases that are on time and not delayed for any reason.  I don’t want to see any delayed releases, please!

Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.

See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Roul is right.  If your guilds aren't interactively with you much then leave them.  Those people are supposed to be your friends, remember?  If you want to improve then work on it.  If you want to quit or take a break then commit, breathe and relax. 
---
And how is having no one playing condi a bad thing?
---
The less condis the better.
---
Thank's 😎
---
By doing the content you like. You'll start recognising guild names at some point, and those are a good place to start since they're (A) active, and (B) do the content you like.
---
I found mine on r/guildrecruitment I think. But search forums, especially for your server. Try out the guild, try and make new friends. If you're on Gate of Madness server, you're welcome to apply to our guild! ^^
---
If you're doing different bosses you'll get rewards. If you repeat a boss you'll miss most of the rewards, just the basic event xp/karma/money.
---
Fighting WBs again on a different character might give you the rewards. I know for like Tequatl it can be repeated with different characters and you'll get all except for the orange chest each try.
---
No screenshots, just the vid showing me play with the item.
---
Do people in WvW suicide themselves into zergs just to observe and relay information? I can't think of any other reason why someone would purposely 1v50 that isn't even chasing them.
---
Seems like someone you'd just tell people in-game, not on Reddit... (might actually be against the rules)  
---
We don't even know what server you're on.  
---
Don’t shitpost in guild chat, sir.
---
Sounds like you should quit your "friends" if anything.
---
less build diversity the better?
---
We forged them at like 3 am old man! 😂😂
---
Current business model would be more efficient if anet didn't abandon most of gw2 development in favor of now cancelled projects. Game needs an expansion every 12-18 months with LW patches every 2 months. At least 2 raids and fractals per year and significant development increase in pvp and wvw areas.
---
However... that was also true in 2016. So question is, is it worth to invest more into ald game or just start the new project at this point.
---
Welllll aetherblade isn’t as much as a face roll as the other two paths... but yeah, they easy. Not to mention, doing 8 diff paths (stories included) will net you a chest of 150 of any dungeon token 
---
Mirage doesnt affect zerg fights at all, especially not as condi. Pretty sure that no roaming build uses antitoxin since there are much better choices.
---
Charr.
---
They're right; people from NA servers aren't able to play with people from EU servers
---
Sometimes people do this to contest capture points. The other case I can think of is when someone is trying to waypoint out but has been stuck in combat due to being hit.
---
how can an argument be lowercase?
---
I’d say bring a pchrono still. CS+TW for bosses is plenty, and the focus pull can help on some bits. Also the burst is nice, and for TA up, the feedback can help if you don’t have enough burst.
---
There are dialogue variations that include references to your race and profession throughout though they are still pretty rare. Even some stuff responds to your story choices. Almost all of it is just super small acknowledgements that don't change anything though. If you gave me the specific story step I could look up the text in question too. 
---
You can party up between NA &amp; EU, but you can’t join each other’s instances.  That’s just how the game servers work.  No need to get so hostile at random people.
---
They absolutely are. I'm telling you. I have friends in EU servers. We play together all the time. 
---
Ooooh stag looks cool.
---
Haha it's so funny, thanks for sharing 😂
---
Do we know if there will be any character slot sales soon?
---
I reckon the item you're thinking of is either 1. [Season 4 Portal Tome](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Season_4_Portal_Tome) or 2. [Spearmarshal's Plea](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spearmarshal%27s_Plea).
---
Item 1 requires you to own the respective living world season 4 episodes, then buy the portal scrolls from the volatile magic vendor.
---
Item 2 is normally picked up as part of the griffon quest, but you can pick it up any time by walking to [Spearmarshal's Lament](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spearmarshal%27s_Lament).
---
No wonder nobody wants to play with you LUL
---
Personally I think this would remove the uniqueness of legendaries, many go after them for their aura but there’s still a sense of legendary-ness considering these weapons are the only places you can get the auras from. 
---
Are you sure they aren't in NA servers? Or maybe you're in EU? https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/23743/cross-server-facts
