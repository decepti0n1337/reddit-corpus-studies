This is quite interesting, because I would have said that that was exactly how they deliver their worldbuilding. Almost every single dynamic event is exactly that, and there's so much ambient dialogue and NPCs you can talk to. I actually think PoF really dropped the ball in this sense, with having so few dynamic events and so few of those having any worldbuilding in them. Having said that I think the domain of Vabbi was amazing for this - good events and dialogue and there was some amazing examples of tell, don't show. A visit to the boneyard teaches so much about the awakened's status in society.
---

---
However, you're quite right that a lot of this is not part of the main flow of the game (if you strictly follow the story). For me it makes sense that the worldbuilding happens in... the world, but I can see that the story missions themselves often don't go into this stuff.

OMG pull your head out. They literally said they don't want to do a map every episode if it doesn't fit - the comment you are responding to is literally referencing the dude in charge of GW2's development saying they don't plan to do what you say they are going to do.
---
Why bother communicating with people like you at all when you are just going to say ArenaNet will paint the wall blue just after ArenaNet says they plan to paint it orange?
---
You know it must be true if there is math involved.
---
People are just not playing reset because the lag is too terrible for them. It is noticeably worse, and there are conspiracy theories going around of downgraded servers to prepare for lower populations.
---
Still this seems to affect mostly reset time and big fights and it's still fine for the most part at lower player counts which is what NA sees outside of reset and certain server prime times.
---
I take more issue with them not being able to mark "This character was deleted as part of resolving a support ticket, do not restore." as a note for this account.
---
Of maps that can reward a Black Lion Key: yes, Bloodstone Fen is easily the fastest.
---
Bloodstone Fen yes.

I work with databases for a living. Whenever a CS rep says something's impossible, what they mean to say is that _they themselves_ don't have the tools to do it. But impossible? Absolutely not. Somewhere at ANet is an overworked DBA with a superiority complex, who has the ability to fix your problem with a few lines of SQL. The problem is getting this escalated to the point where he gets an email from his supervisor telling him what to do, at which point he'll spend five minutes writing the script and six hours bullshitting about how he's almost got it ready until he executes it half an hour before quitting time.
---
Point is, keep at it, and this will probably get resolved _eventually_.

When leveling a character the most important part is to have your gear always on check every 10lvl. As for me, I tend to do it starting at lv.15(Precise), 25(Hunter's), 35(StrongM), 45(Strong), 55(Knight's) lasting to lv.65(Berserker's) as my last upgrade because I always use Tome of Knowledge from lv.70-72 up to lv.80. With regards traits, weapons and utilities that I will use in Guardian [this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PWwAEt3lVwQYTMM2IO0L+A-zhgIKFqqAA-e) is what it looks like. Always starts with Radiance so that your F1 resets when killing mobs because mobs in open-world are sometimes spreads out with distances so it's hard to aggro 5 and kill them all at once. Sometimes you ends up with one-at-a-time.
---
What are the living world maps?  Is jahai bluff and dragonfall example?
---
This needs to be higher up because the rest of the comments say bloodstone fen!
---
Really? How? I will use it to level my key farmer toon.
---
Sorry, that wasn't an attack or a /s.  A genuine question.  
---
I remember someone long ago had mentioned a variation of the daredevil thief that they felt could succeed on anything with the exception of a couple of the hardest bounties solo.  Unfortunately, I don't remember what it was and was curious to try it out.  I am guessing your build isn't the same, but I'm not sure...I'm not even sure if you're the same person who might have posted before?
---
In any case, the boss I picked here is definitely soloable.  There are other ghosts around and lots of constant torment and some special attacks.  It's not an easy fight, however, to solo especially considering you have a time limit (but not a terrible one).   When I experiment/create PvE builds, it's one of the tests I give my builds.  
---
Again, I apologize if my question came of as attacking or negative in any way.  I have some other builds I'm playing around with, but wanted to ask if this could beat Hablion, then I'd be curious to add it to my list of builds to experiment with as I try them on many hard opponents.
---
For a second I thought I was in /r/warframe and was very confused.
---
Need to use teleport to friend stones.
---
I read the responses from their support in this thread.  
---
The part I have trouble with is they don't have a section for notes???  I imagine they can put notes in for help with future calls and for tracking.  I'm not talking about flags, but just actual notes.   Such a note would simply say that any character with the name of "xxxxx" should not be restored due to previous actions replacing a legendary weapon.  
---
Another option -  can they rollback your account prior to when you removed the sigil?  That is, if you're willing to lose everything since then.
---
Regardless, the other thing I think is that if they can't even make a note or rollback, that they should give you something at least for their oversight.  Whenever an action makes something account bound, we're told and you weren't.  Personally.....if it was me, I'd get that fixed and then afterwards give you something for that trouble, gold, gems, something.
---
honestly the only thing i liked about NOT having the autoloot mastery without expansions is that the kills staying on the ground was the closest thing to ragdolls and being able to look back at how many enemies u just defeated like in halo or elder scrolls lol

Though the Silverwastes and Dry Top are Living World maps, you still get keys below level 80. The Southsun Cove restriction was already in place, so they probably meant LWS3 episode maps onward.

Ah, my mistake. 
---
I think it makes sense that the deaths wouldn't have a huge impact though - they're not characters we're actually familiar with so it doesn't really make sense for us to dwell on every death. The constant deaths are part of a more general theme of the cost of war - tragic, but we're a soldier and we have to move forward. 
---
Belinda is similar, we don't really know her so it doesn't hugely affect us. Who it does affect is Marjory, who is clearly devastated and is absent from the group while dealing with the loss - closure is gained towards the end of the season. While the cast is large, it's still absolutely about the commander's experience, not anyone elses so it's a different kind of storytelling but that doesn't make it inherently bad.
---
When the deaths do become more personal, as with our mentor, then time is given to it - I mean you only have to look at the continued adoration for Tybalt to see that it was effective storytelling! And both expansions have referred back to our mentor's so they haven't been forgotten. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I think I stated before, but I do agree that in many ways the original personal story (and season 1) fails because it does not effectively blend the story with the gameplay. But I think it is possible to look at the story seperately and judge it - and I do think that original game had a good story, badly told. I think season one was a slight improvement on the telling, but told a worse story and was in general worse. I will continue to defend season 2 as some of the best work they've done as the gameplay was markedly better and the story was given the time it needed. HoT was a low point again - I think the story they wanted to tell would have been good, but they had to cut so much that it killed it and the gameplay wasn't much better than S2. Season 3 was very volatile - some episodes were great but others were weak, due to the different teams having different groups of writers. PoF-Season 4 have been very strong though in my opinion, while I think the story can be a bit rushed at times, the merging of gameplay and story is the best its ever been and the story itself is usually strong.
---
My point regarding the successful telling of story within gameplay is still one I want to make though - you've recounted the backstory to this moment, but iirc (I did play FFX at release but not since) all of this pretty much happens in cutscenes - the experience would be barely changed if the gameplay was removed entirely. Sin attacks the boat which looks awesome and dramatic, but what you (the player) do is smack a few bugs and then Sin leaves. 
---
None of this is to reduce the effectiveness of FFX's story, but to point out that it is not actually merging the gameplay and story, but having them exist side-by-side. 
---
In GW2 you perform the majority of the story beats yourself. To use an example from S4E4, at the very start of the summit you choose who you talk to, then when the summit is attacked you lead the delegates to safety and the number who make it is dependent upon your skill as a player. Then when something dramatic happens, it happens in the world while you retain full control of your character. The experience will vary from player to player and this is absolutely how stories should be told in an interactive medium otherwise what is really happening is that you're playing the game then taking a break to watch a short film. 
---
Now of course, it is possible to tell a very enjoyable story through a cutscene-heavy approach (I adore FFVIII) but I would argue that when done this way then it should be compared to other non-interactive media such as films or books. And I have yet to see a game that can come anywhere close to a good film or book in this sense. 
---
It's much harder for a game to tell a story as a game, as the more agency you give the player the less directed the experience becomes. But I think games that attempt this should be judged on those merits, and I believe GW2 succeeds in this aspect far more than most other games.
---
The problem I see with this is that you cannot return a physical item if it has been opened/used. So there needs to be a way to tell whether a digital item has been used. You could probably check if a game has been launched, but then I'm sure someone would create a hack that could make a game seem like it hasn't been. That would allow people to play a game fully and then simply refund it.
---
For items in a game it's even more difficult as most are used on purchased.

i feel like Anet was still experimenting alot with season 2. like that whole new story every 2 weeks period was them trying to figure out the best way to do things. i honestly wouldnt mind if the season 5 announcement was that starting in january itll be a new thing every month lol and 12 months of expansion-type additions to the game and maybe 4 out of those 12 are for side things like big balance and whatever update the build templates come with, but thats probably wishful thinking lol
---
Probably  because one festival is chasing the next one. There is hardly any normal gameplay currently.
---
Exactly. Just look at WvW. It's a game mode not all of us love sure, but many people did play the game just for that gamemode. It could have been developed, iterated upon, but nope. Same old thing for 7 years.
---
"If the claim is valid" is already a distortion of consumer rights.
---
In many countries, refunds are available *just because.* You don't need a substantial reason. You can just return it if you feel like it. As /u/CommunistCreatine's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cnwxr1/anet_support_wont_help_with_unlistableungiftable/ewgd1mj/) says, unfortunately, this does not include online shopping YET. 
---
This is a consequence of laws not catching up to the digital age and companies taking advantage of it. The reality is not "It's legal so it's okay" but "this is not illegal, so we're going to exploit it." Many companies do this and it's not okay.
---
By all *good* standards of business, it's their responsibility to write that code to relock skins and *provide* it to customer support.
---
Arena Net does **not** always offer gemstore refunds. They do so once, then they straight up say they can't for all future attempts. There's plenty of people not being heard under the highly upvoted posts about them providing refunds the first time.
---
JFC you're barking up the wrong tree.

I did, asked for groups multiple times, tried to communicate etc. No responses despite catching up with a group of ~30 people who refused to communicate or include me in the group... so I just logged out :(

&gt;Armor and weapons are surprisingly fair (with the exception of Season 3, which I think soured a lot of people on the gemstore entirely). 
---
What happened in season 3 with the gemstore?
---
Actually that's how we say eighty in French :)
---
All hints so far point to going north. As you mention. Yet you're thinking it'll bring us to the clashing seas, that are *south*?
---
We might get more of the offshoot of northern largos that are even more mysterious than the southern largos, but honestly since there's only two or three mentions of such northern largos and literally no difference from the southern brand, those northern ones were likely just travelers so I wouldn't expect much largos stuff at all.
---
&gt; Largos &amp; Krait have serious beef equaled only by that of Charr &amp; Humans (get me right if I'm wrong please). 
---
They're not. There's some rivalry, due to the largos viewing the krait as worthy enemies, but no "over a thousand years of open warfare and bitter hatred" between the two. It's closer to early day relationship between charr and norn; the norn were powerful enough to stop small scale threats of charr invading their lands, and charr would kill any norn wandering into their territories, so they saw each other as powerful rivals (until they began a friendship via that rivalry).
---
&gt; For it to be implied that they have unknown horrors is a bit much. The Largos know all about Orr. 
---
The 'unknown horrors' likely refers to the deep sea dragon and its minions. They never mention the DSD, only that there are horrors in their homeland (homewater?). Implication is that their homewaters have only recently been besieged by these "horrors" which matches with the timeline of the DSD's movements.
---
Thought about that, but none of my combos use alt (changed hotkeys specifically to stop alt/tabbing).
---
Tybalt sticks out in core game story because he is unique. He indeed has some "individual behaviours", some character. He is well written imho and if I remember correct did GW2 also used fitting music for this part. But as far as I remember is no mentor mentioned afterwards ever again. Anet could bring them up from time to time, even in recent LS episodes. It's the small things in storytelling which make a difference. We, as commander, thinking "well...what would tybalt do in this situation?" - just to name one example.
---
For apatia: if she would be just a unknown soldier among many we should not hold a speech for her, bad "filler story" then. If she is more special GW2 fails to bring in emotions. If Anet tried to go into "well it's war, people die": they should've brought up how this impacts us (or other teammates) more, for most leaders in war it's also not easy to bring home thousands of corpses. This wears leaders out, too. Makes them question their leadership skills, their decisions, if that war is justified.
---
Main char in GW2 is intentionally bland, so everyone can interpret him differently. I prefer a "scripted" FF like char, but that's preference. But Anet then needs to focus on other characters (teammembers as taimi) for character development. It's a really bad idea to let characters disappear because they are sad. Marjory should've stayed with us, this could've helped to storywriters to "build" her character. Instead we got a team full of relativly bland characters, too. (has improved). I can't tell for PoF, I haven't bought it. I can tell that these aspects in storytelling improved already with post HoT LS, but were still far from justifying the term "RPG". 
---
A good story badly told is imho a bad story. LS2 (scarlet, right?) had an antagonist which with an okayish build up. While zhaitan or mordremoth are nearly 100% anonymus, which is not great.
---
FF10: I tried to point out that you can fluently connect story, combat, action cutscenes. Merging them all together is very different, as you point out. It's difficult and also not suited for calmer parts.
---
You are completly right that more merged elements as "in combat story" is relativly rare in FF. There are some dialogues with bosses in combat, there is maybe a boss turning into something different - but overall: yes, you could cut out combats and watch FFs as movies. But: you could watch FFs as movies, it would ~ still be worth it because the story is strong enough. There are actually such cuts on youtube with hundredthousands to millions of views. GW2 story content cut together as a movie would be a terrible experience and only worth it for hardcore lore fans.
---
Which also explains why FF managed to stay alive with an 1980-early 1990s combat system, while all other rpgs (see baldurs gate 1 etc.) had already more advanced combat. But every change has pros and cons.
---
I personally think that many, especially the most important aspects of storytelling (as character development) are not suited for "merged content". Players are distracted and not listening to half an hour of dialogue while they fight modremoth. So you can tell "what is happening", but important background info, characters developing or speaking/thinking about past events ("well, we killed mordremoth, but we lost so many blablabla") is not well suited to be mixed with gameplay. GW1 has lots of dialogue popups in storymissions - players often don't read them or are too distracted to do so. GW2 is a lot more actionoriented and players completly miss even existing instructions given in some combats by npcs. 
---
OFC are many MMO players not caring about story, so such "deeper" story content needs to be skipable. 
---
Most films or books aren't having good stories. See story of fast&amp;furious or ong-bak and most other martial arts movies. Final fantasy is for sure not going to win awards for it's story in comparison to movies or books. But I'd say it's still doing a decent job in comparision.

I've never posted about this particular topic in the past, but this build isn't a unique creation of mine or anything. It's effectively the meta power daredevil raid dps build but swapped to invigorating precision and channeled vigor, with an optional swap to the trait that makes swipe steal health (or you can keep the +80 power trait).
---
When I was trying to figure out some of the best open world builds, I basically was thinking condi mirage would be insane because of the evade uptime, but turns out condi feels awful in open world because everything takes multiple seconds to die lulw
---
Anyways, this build has similar evade uptime with insane burst damage, very high self sustain via invigorating precision, and a bunch of unique situational tools like prolonged stealth, thief portal, and shadowstep. Even better, if you're doing blob content like bounties or the boss rush after the dragonfall meta, it basically instantly converts to a top dps build as long as you have quickness, since staff 2 and the 3rd chain skill of staff auto attack do so much frikkin damage.
---
No clue if it could solo Hablion, my guess would be yes if it doesn't have any cheese mechanics. Sounds like there are archers with projectiles so, fun fact: while staff 2 doesn't do this, the 3rd chain skill of the auto attack on staff actually reflects projectiles. That's come in useful more than once in the past.
---
"Honor of The Waves" changes drastically after 11pm....
---
There is a dynamic event that references your mentor that can spawn after their death, they can appear in the fight against mordremoth, and they appear during The Departed mission in PoF. So they do bring our mentor up from time to time.
---
The speech we give for Apatia is to honor her memory as her commander, but that doesn't mean we have to be traumatised by it. And the deaths incurred in the war against Zhaitan DO weigh upon the leader - Trahearne - there is an entire act of the personal story that deals with his struggles leading the pact. You are right that the commander is left intentionally blank, but the other characters really do pick up the slack. I think it's absolutely fine to have characters be absent for periods as it gives the other characters more attention - with Marjory gone Kasmeer got more development, especially as she had relied on Marjory quite a lot so her absence was meaningful. Of all the supporting cast, I would say it is only Rox that doesn't have strong characterisation. 
---
LS2 was post-scarlet, it dealt with the lead-up to Mordremoth but more specifically built towards the realisation that the Sylvari were created by Mordremoth.
---
I think my feelings can be best summed up with an analogy: if a movie regularly paused and had someone explain the emotions the characters were feeling and what the plot was doing, it would be a terrible movie. Even if the explanations were good, if the creators couldn't tell their story with the audio-visual tools of their medium, it's not a good film story.
---
If a game cannot tell its story through gameplay, it is a bad game story. And yes, it's MUCH harder to actually do this well, but it can be done.
---
While "most" films or books might not have good stories, I am confident that the average quality is much higher - The Fast &amp; Furious movies could well be some of the worst film stories, but even they are better than many video game stories. 
---
More importantly, I think even the very best cutscene-focused game is nowhere close to the best books, films or TV. When people think of the very best narratives in gaming (games such as Firewatch, Her Story, Planescape Torment etc etc) they all tell their story through gameplay. Even games with cutscenes such as Silent Hill 2 or The Witcher 3 have their greatest narrative moments during gameplay.
---
The telling doesn't even need to be sophisticated - consider Dark Souls or Bloodborne. These games deliver story through item descriptions of all things, but are some of the most captivating storytelling in gaming due to how it has to be pieced together from the world itself. Dark Souls 1 even uses this to trick you - the story that DS1 tells you is a lie, and the true story is revealed by exploring and inference from the environment. Games such as this are excellent examples of how you can tell stories in an interactive medium.
---
Definitely dragonfall. No hearts, Just PoI and 3WPs. When the shrines are up, you can get it done in as little as 20mins on a beetle.  Bloodstone fen is a close 2nd but the vertical structure of it makes it a bit slower.
---
&gt; you cannot return a physical item if it has been opened/used. 
---
Except this depends on the product.
---
And in the case of digital goods, the difference between opened/used and not is irrelevant because it's ultimately just a batch of code that you can delete and paste anew so there's no real loss in product.

---
&gt; not only an emphasis on outfits, which are heavily disliked already
---
While I dislike outfits trying to use your opinions as a fact for everyone is pretty asinine and incorrect. If outfits were a flop they would move away from them. The fact they still make them and you see a *ton* of players wearing them says they are quite popular.

---
Put dispenser here.
---
From the perspective of someone that runs more training-orientated runs, I tend to dislike having a Scourge in the party. There are a few reasons for this.
---
Scourge requires knowledge of the fight to be effective. You need to know when abilities are incoming to have Barrier up or you need to be aware of when people are likely to go down. This means if you have an effective Scourge in your training group, they are probably one of the experienced players. At that stage, it isn't so much training as carrying as the experienced Scourge will be able to negate a lot of the mechanics.
---
If you have someone that is training as a Scourge, they aren't going to be very useful at what Scourge is designed for. I feel someone in this situation is better learning a reactive healer (like Tempest) or a more widely used support healer such as Druid. In both situations, the training is more effective as the reactive healer can learn damage patterns through the damage going out and then being healed up and the Druid can learn when it is most important to get boons out (and also why boons are so important!).
---
As a secondary healer, I feel it also can't dip in to help with boons if someone is learning to Druid. If we have someone learning to Druid, I'll tend to request for my partner (who is experienced) to play a hybrid Tempest healer build that can do some boons and can have staff handy to help out with topping up healing done by the Druid. This way, the role of the Druid as a healer isn't being negated (as it would be with a Scourge) and we are still mainly dependent on the Druid for boons so they can learn how to get those CA rotations down.
---
Having a Scourge negates the impact on the group of going down due to the fast resurrections. I like for training to make it clear that going down isn't a good idea so having someone stay down or see the impact on the group as time is lost to rezzing makes it clearer to avoid the mechanic in the future.
---
Finally, I believe the idea of training is to help people graduate to their own, or other, groups. These groups may not have a Scourge healer so if they become reliant on Barrier negating mechanics, or being resurrected quickly, it is going to be harder for them to transition to environments with different healer setups.
---
Scourge is excellent for carrying, but negates a lot of the reason to do training.
---
Yep exactly... And with season 1 only having a flashback it's like getting the first book then only finding the 3rd in print :(
---
A Scourge doesn't provide a safety net for mechanics such as Dhuum greens or typical tank roles. It provides a skip functionality for mechanics that don't cause instant death, meaning people don't need to pay as much attention to those mechanics. Which results in training being ineffective.
---
&gt; \-Greens on VG. -Walls on Gorseval -Cannons on Sabetha. -Mushrooms on Sloth -Saboteur on Trio -Can reflect on Matt ETC. ETC. 
---
All of these mechanics are unrelated to a Scourge being present.
---
Greens on VG can be overhealed by a solo Druid. A Scourge being present just makes the raid less aware that that is a moment where health drops considerably where they need to pay more attention to their positioning, blues and the location of seekers.
---
Needing to do walls on Gorseval is related to DPS, not Scourges.
---
Cannons on Sabetha are an essential mechanic. They can't really be ignored by a Scourge as the platform will be destroyed.
---
Mushrooms on Sloth are again a standard mechanic unless you are running a cheese composition or you have insanely good DPS.
---
And so on...
---
On a different note - happy cake day!

Not sure about performance, since Discord greatly improved it lately but I am calling fucking bullshit on audio quality. On discord you can tweak that and even increase it greatly if the server has nitro.
---
Oh good idea for over. I do love my condi shortbow ranger.
---
Power Scourge and Power Herald are easy, much needed, classes in WvW (scourge is area denial and boon strip, while herald is hard hitting ranged damage with some proximity based utility, some minor melee damage depending on if you took Staff or Sword+Sword/Shield).
---
You dont *really* need a guild, you're perfectly capable of joining any random zerg and doing your part, but a guild does help you to better acquaint yourself to the mode as well as know when you can reliably get a group going (peak hours and such, some guilds only run during off hours).
---
&gt;No, it isn't. Barrier is a type of temporary effective health point increase (also known as an absorb in other MMOs) which functions differently from healing. Healing restores lost health whereas barrier adds a buffer that is eaten through before further health is lost, or is degraded over time. It doesn't actually restore health points. Another way to look at it is through the guise of Aegis which also functions as an absorb. We wouldn't classify Aegis as healing because, on its own, it doesn't restore health points. 
---
Fair enough, but 
---
&gt;The functions of healing and absorbs are different, which is the issue with using Scourge in a training environment. Absorbs prevent mechanics from dealing as much damage, negating the impact of the them. With groups that don't have absorbs, the mechanics are felt normally and the health needs to be restored by healing. 
---
This concept isn't limited to only Scourges and by extension, barriers, though. If a healer is competent enough, they'd be able to heal as the mechanic is happening (like VG greens for example).  might not do it as well as barrier, but the concept still applies. 
---
&gt;Therefore, for a Scourge to do their job well, they need to know the encounter. If you have a good Scourge, they probably don't need the training and are just acting to carry, rather than allow learning to occur. 
---
It's usually the trainers who play support roles, as new raiders typically role dps classes first since they're easier to use whilst learning an encounter, but yeah I agree.
---
Don’t, do something else
---
If you have every profession made on your account maybe let him play each one in PvP and see what he takes to? My mom (62 )  tried out my Spellbreaker ,  and enjoyed herself for the brief period she wanted to actually play before deciding " my game wasn't her cup of tea. "  I think she enjoyed dressing my character more  .
---
You truly don't have a mechanism to put notes on customers' files that other reps can read in case the customer subsequently tries to get a character undeleted after an incident like this?
---
We gonna talk about 'that's not how claws work'?
---
Thank you for the helpful details, I appreciate it! :)
---
WvW is not for everyone if you enjoy getting one shot by roamers playing cheese build it's up to you but I don't
---
GARLS WORK, MEN PLAY.
---
Maybe go ahead and start him out with that.  Any class is good if there are no physical limitations.  After a while, head to SPvP with just you and him in 1 on 1s where you're teaching.  You should get a feel of how well he will adapt :)
---
Hi everybody, I'm a returning player after many years and I have a silly question.
---
When I do a mount race (e.g. the one in the first city of PoF with the raptors) I am the same level of the other players, I have the same mount, we don't have to use particular skills or tools like other races (like the ones with the crystals). Why the hell I don't have the same speed of the other players?
---
As soon as the race starts quite everybody jumps ahead and everybody seems faster then me.
---
Sorry, I understand this probably is stupid but I really cannot figure it out, maybe someone could help.
---
You are either new to the game or haven't hit top mastery level of 295. Sure the points you are gonna get fast-ish, if you are good at replaying and getting all story chapters achievs at 100%. In a month you might be able to get most if not all the mastery points for all 3 mastery tracks, but XP in traditional ways, I very highly doubt it will be doable in just 2 months, if you are a normal person who has a life outside the game. If you are gonna play 24/7 with catheters in all the ends to keep you borderline alive, then sure, absolutely do-able in 2 months. But after that you won't need a trophy but a doctor.
---
P.S. Jokes aside, looking at how many MP I have left after reaching 295MP, seems like the devs and the game "throw" these points at you, not so true with high ammounts of XP but it is definetly fine with the good chunk from all sourses XP
---
People have answered already, but a point when soloing dungeons or 2 person, a couple of dungeons have a mechanic in place requiring 3 players.  I don't remember which, but I'mguessing some do.
---
Asurans are thinkers and this one got a plot.
---
good heavens people in this sub  are more toxic than  whoever they say is that they would downvote this post for. if you don't like whoever its depicting just move on, it's the least you can do just for the effort put I.to the art
---
Don't listen to the shitters, wvw is fun and is the true endgame. Just be prepared to criticism and you absolutely need a gear just for wvw, pve stuff won't do. Pick a meta class and get on your server's discord or ts and ask them for a build
---
Such massive discounts -__-
---
Do you just have the basic mount with no masteries? If so you're missing out on things like canyon jumping, where you can jump longer distances, and the skill bond of vigor which increases your endurance rate meaning you can leap more often for a short period of time. These two masteries can give someone an incredible head start compared to someone with just a basic raptor.
---
Nope! We're waiting on more. You're all caught up. :)
---
Security aside that is also a great way to accidentally wreck your database and take the game offline for a while.
---
Hum, yes indeed. And thank you for the answer!  I have just the mastery which makes the raptor stronger in the 1 attack with the tail. I thought about the one for the longer jump but honestly I didn't realize there is one for endurance too.
---
&gt; Why the heck should one have to know they can't sell un-sigiled legendaries from looking at other legendaries?
---
because everything masterwork rarity or about becomes account bound if you make any sort of modification to them
---
Not a known issue, no. Mounts are working fine. Can you trigger your mount manually from the button next to your elite skill?  What button do you have bound for general mounting? And do you have a specific keybind for each mount? Eg: For me, my general mount/dismount button is Q. Where as I have each mount bound to Shift-A, Shift-S, Shift D, etc etc. 
---
Also just to rule it out, are you trying to use your mount in an area where you can actually use mounts?
---
First know which class you comfortable with in PVE, and second check out YouTube with for example search “spellbreaker GW2 wvw” and yeah I like warrior and I did that search and found some CAKE videos with Vanass forgot the name but then I play warrior based on his setting with little mods. Like if you like guardian, then you search “dragon hunter GW2 wvw” you will have more idea how is it like. Good luck bro
---
I mean you could also start with a different game...  
---
Like one of the "interactive movie" type, like Life is Strange.  
---
It's not difficult (-&gt; not frustrating), and pulls you in a beautiful story.
---
I mean on the other hand once he is done with it he is done, which might be good, or bad. But that was my thought at least.
---
I got back into WvW this weekend... my PvE Chrono, well, he adapted, but my WvW Chrono was gutted. 
---
I need a new WvW toon. Checking out recommendations in this thread.
---
With clothes you're can't return them if the tag is pulled off which is their way of "opening" them. 
---
It is, however, not uncommon for people to abuse that system when it comes to clothes. Especially if it's a one-time thing that people need, such as a dress or a suit. The limiter on it is that people have to actually physically go down to the store and return them while looking the employees in the face.
---
For digital goods it's not about them losing an item or losing value. It's about the ease of abuse if they could be returned after use. People are much more willing to simply click a few buttons online and get a free game that way.
---
Yeah, I guess Amazon has just learned that it's cheaper to send a new item than to deal with the return :D
---
I find the personal story in core tyria to be interesting to do. although it may not be as great as the newer story lines, what you do get is to experience and see the old Lions Arch trough the story.   
---
I dont remember how many times lions arch have changed over the year but it should be 2 or 3 times at least, but in the core personal story nothing is changed and you get to see the original lions arch and how it looked like year ago before any changes were made.
---
Fair point. Anet really need to figure out a solution to the content drip feed.
---
http://builds.vabbi.org
---
Here you can find builds with notes how to play them.
---
If you truly want to let him play forever, solving problems and all that, buy him Factorio. 
---
In GW2 I don't think that one would need to stick with single class, most are on par with each other :)
---
This. I'm doing missing explo paths for dungeon master achievement currently and have no trouble finding full groups within few mins after putting an advertisement on lfg. You'd be surprised how many new people at minimum level needed for explo there are.
---
I think guardian is a solid choice. During dungeon meta days I had to put aside my necro and play guardian. And I was amazed how easy it was to carry pugs. You have good DPS and good utilities to save your teammates.
---
I agree. Did the guild wars even get mentioned in the game?
---
The flashback is reading the backcover of book 2.
---
It is not just the level I'm after actually. The range lv.70-72 is connected to HP in tyria. Around that level I should be able to have atleast 90HP that I've already taken in core tyria so once I'm 80, I'll be able to damp them to the Elite specialization of my choice so that anytime of the day I'll be able to get the rest in PoF maps even if I'm alone.
---
I'm getting Ragarnarok Online bard vibes :D
---
Honestly people in their twenties are minority in WvW. Most of active veteran players are in their 30s and 40s. Inability to follow command is you personal problem, not the age of commander.
---
&gt;sign
---
Perhaps a signet warrior would work.
---
I, too, hate "that stupid fucking retro jumping game", but it sounds silly to say that the game has been dying for 6.5 years out of its 7.
---
I'd say LS2's biggest problem is pacing. Once you go to the World Meeting, things get more interesting, but before that it was a complete utter slog of very uninteresting things stopping your progress.
---
You still get the weird detour that takes the urgency out of the pacing once or twice after that, but it doesn't feel like pulling teeth anymore.
---
Guardian is actually better option without gear to start doing WvW. Even core guard in knight/soldier gear is better than slacking geared scourge.
---
WvW reward tracks can give you full set of exotic minster armor rather fast (24h hours  of gameplay with boosters to be correct). And accessories are easy to get in PvE.
---
Core guardian is also great learning tool to do several sessions and then switch to more complex Firebrand.
---
If possible - What if it was put on an alt character and deleted; if that character was restored would it restore Eternity to its original state?
---
German translations of ingame stuff always sound so cringeworthy to me. Why is that?
---
It does. One can only enjoy so much exploring.
---
I don't feel like I can partake in stuff like Fractals, Raids or WvW either because people are very impatient and rude when you're trying to step in there from PvE and need help getting the hang of it
---
and that's where i think most players go wrong, they think about these things as values. You should aim to have fun, that is what entertainment is mostly about, that includes games. when i do GMs with the guild i don't calculate how much i earn but i enjoy the time im spending with friends. I dont get anything valuable from racing that_shaman in random adventures but i get to laugh at the back and forth memes and racing.
---
Stop playing the game like it's about making money
---
Guadians are great classes to start on. They’re useful in every game mode, especially wvw in which they’re essential. 
---
Testing each class in pvp is never a bad idea as well. Good luck and I hope he enjoys the game as many of us do!
---
If you ask you will get good answers. If you want to leech, you will be bullied out.
---
I want to learn how to play those games, but the few groups that have actually let me in have been rude about me not knowing how to play those modes.
---
Hard to do when your guild members are quitting left and right due to lack of content :/
---
I keep asking this, but what's the appeal of fishing? I don't get it. I've never seen it done as anything other than a mind-numbing, braindead mini-game that people bot when they're afk.
---
For some reason they refer to the Risen as the Unchained (Entfesselten).
---
Thank you for the translation! Not really a lot of concrete details, as expected, but still good to get some teasers.
---
WvW end game right here.
---
I feel if you want to game, even Linux is a better option than mac anymore.
---
Plus, Macs are fucking garbage.
---
I'm not blaming players. if you dont enjoy a game you should try to find something you do. but what im saying is that there are always people doing any content the game had you can find people to play with.
---
I don't really care about fishing or housing as much as others, but I think Anet should really embrace something that already defines GW2 - Fashion Wars! Completely new and improved UI and tools to customize your characters with ability to save your fashion templates, share your look via codes (like GW1 skill builds), fashion tournaments, fashion hunts, ingame fashion leaderboards and ratings!
---
&gt; It's satisfying at times but the whole "listening to some hoarse-voiced twenty year old yammer out instructions to you on discord" aspect of it is, to put it mildly, not everyone's idea of a good gameplay experience.
---
Going to the discord is not mandatory, Just don't do it.
---
Icba listening to how spammy and loud WvW voicecomms can be so I just don't bother with it.
---
Roaming is dead. You don't need to worry just get a mount and you can avoid all PvP in WvW!
---
Housing, assuming it brings a good amount of decorations with it, will keep me busy for like 20hours tops. 
---
It's not like you can replay it, unless you want to destroy the house you made over and over.
---
Literarily the only thing that keeps me from playing Gw2.
---
Very easy calming money and gold farming while you have a day where you dont want todo anything.
---
Thank you for your hard work!
---
Interesting stuff there.
---
From what I've managed to play, it's like a territory control game mode, right? Through "capital" buildings in territories you can gain control of that chunk. And I know they're often guarded by NPCs that you either pick off one by one or go in as a group.
---
I don't know, however, what importance the building blueprints have, since you could just have a large group of players ambush the enemy, barge in through the gate and take the building. And I have no idea what skirmishes in WvW are, either. I have some skirmish points but I'm not even sure how I got them in the first place.
---
Can we take over Woodland Cascades from those stupid horsebutts and build our houses there already?
---
Sigh we can but wish. The engine is appalling. I mean my PC isn't the best but it plays more graphically intensive games better than gw2. I really WISH they would do something to update it.
---
If you enjoy the company of the people you're playing with, it's entirely different.  Yes you are following orders but you are working as a team and a cohesive unit, everyone doing their part.  That is the appeal IMO.  With that said there's absolutely nothing wrong with being a roamer if that type of play style isn't for you.
---
Check archeage sea fishing is a lot of fun
---
The best example for me honestly has been playing GW2 and then recently picking up Final Fantasy XIV. 
---
Major cities in GW2 in max settings I’ll get 40-45 FPS. 
---
Lions Arch will dip even lower. 
---
Major cities in FFXIV in max settings I’ll get 60-75 FPS.  
---
FFXIV also *looks* tremendously better. It’s amazing what the difference between DX9 vs DX11 is.
---
Not just a womans face, several of the gods (dont know exactly but afaik it's melandru lyssa balth grenth and dwayna).
---
I’ve always enjoyed necro for an easy time at least in pve. Can be as tanky he might need there’s the perk that pops shroud if you get low if he needs a second chance. The rotation is easy enough for reaper being like half auto attacks
---
Nice find

You can use the scrolls too for living season maps, that's what I've always done.
---
We're in luck as Season 4 did touch on this Branding topic already and expanded on what we saw in personal story and Central Tyria maps. :)
---
Every dragon champion and lieutenant has the ability to corrupt others to grow the dragon minion army for their Elder Dragon master. Some dragon-corrupted artifacts can do this over time too as we saw in the Kellach story in human personal story chapter 3 where the dragon crystal slowly corrupted [Corporal Kellach](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Corporal_Kellach) into a Risen. We saw this minion-corruption more recently in e.g. during the Branded [assault on Amnoon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Eye_of_the_Brandstorm) in Season 4 when Kralkatorrik sent one of his champions, a Branded wyvern, to corrupt the people of Amnoon into Branded and use these newly created Branded lieutenants to raise the dead as Death-Branded minions (with the wyvern specifically focusing on the Awakened at first if you had allied Amnoon with Joko) to bolster the invading horde's numbers, which forced us to kill the [corrupted Qais](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Deputy_Qais) to put him out of his misery.
---
Some notable quotes from the "Eye of the Brandstorm" instance when Amnoon is under assault:
---
&gt; **Canach:** But enough chitchat. Those Branded lieutenants are raising undead. I hope you wore your Risen-kicking boots.  
---
&gt; **Captain Rahim:** The Awakened fought well at first, but...it was almost as if dragon targeted them specifically. Now that they're all Branded, we're overwhelmed!  
---
&gt; **Rytlock Brimstone:** Commander, if Kralkatorrik's minions can Brand people even when it's not nearby...we have a very big problem.
---
&gt;we try to vary the designs of the different sets as much as possible
---
Laughs in trenchcoats.
---
Scourge. Maybe Ranger?
---
MHW has generally slower combat style people aren’t used to. I would suggest that game if GW 2 doesn’t suit him. I love both for the no gear treadmill (new Iceborne expansion will add master rank, but it’s been 2 years with just high rank. Low rank you dont need and blaze through it.)
---
I see you're one of those people I like to call an "idiot". ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I just did it and I got the achievement. I have no idea if it was bugged before but you have to be careful as there are 2 nature elementals. One ley-infused and one champion. I did the ley-infused a few days ago and was wondering why it didn't count but I checked again today and killed the champion and it counted. Good luck to all!
---
As a GW1 player, I love the Charr, so we'll see how that focus works out.
---
Lol! So true.
---
Judging from previous comments, everyone here gets disappointed on August 30.
---
Housing and Fishing aren't going to fix socialization.  GW2 has just become *the* game for shy players, and it seems like it has zero plans on changing.
---
If you're on NA and want to learn Fractals I'm willing to toss together a casual pug group for you to learn with on T1/T2.  Only thing is I'm going to be on vacation for the next week or so.
---
And your toxic. So we can team up.
---
So I have this chronic issue in Fractals. I play healbrand, and for some reason even though I'm the healer I take the most damage of all 5 of us. I've been watching and it seems like I take aggro a lot (possibly because heals are usually weighted more in the aggro equation than raw damage). Like 80% of the time I have to use a big heal it's because I'm too low to stay alive long enough to let other heals bring me up. Is there any way to fix this? Do I just need to git gud? I know only real aggro mechanic is in raids with some bosses aggroing to highest toughness but I'm pretty sure there's still a basic aggro equation in each mob, otherwise they wouldn't aggro on to you in open world you know.
---
I have actually found one fishing minigame that I enjoy, and that's Warframe's. Instead of just kinda AFKing, it's a spear fishing game that requires you to actually aim at the fish, time your shots, and reel in at the correct time. It actually improves your accuracy with thrown weapons, I've found! 
---
Something like that, which is less passive, might be neat.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aggro
---
There is this article about it.
---
It is somewhat random who is being targeted with most mobs and bosses.
---
I can recommend mixing either vitality stats into your equipment or what I do, toughness, running giver/minstrel gear :) giver as base to gain maximum concentration and then minstrel so I don't overcap.
---
Find out if your server uses Discord for communi action. It makes a huuuuge difference if you can hear the commander giving commands.
---
Nothing is impossible when you're willing to take 30-45m to do a 10-15m path.  There are a lot of players like me that are *occasionally* willing to teach dungeons/fractals, but I have not had many good experiences with LFG randos.  They tend to ignore mechanics or suicide and only communicate when they think you're obligated to res them.  I think a lot of semi-exp/exp players would prefer to low-man dungeons rather than bring newer players along.  That's a really just a consequence of design...
---
This is ridiculous. You can’t “the technology just isn’t there” something as basic as this.
---
Anet CS right now is do far more than the $190 Eternity-worth of PR damage. When the company implements a rushed new system with big UX/UI oversights, you deal with it promptly by graciously taking a hit, and then connect with your colleagues to avoid the inevitable future cases. 
---
You do not vilify the customer and question their integrity with contrived what-ifs. “What if we give them the base swords and the customer sells them separately? What if they ask my CS underlings restore the mule account with the offending item?” This is all over a skin unlock.
---
This issue is really underlining how drastic the silos are at Anet, when you’d rather say sorry, not sorry on Reddit than reaching out to your colleagues to resolve a glaring issue.
---
Good housing allows for dropping every item from the game in your house and placing it at any X, Y, Z coordinate and angle.
---
no.
---
Low effort.
---
How long ago did this happen? Only thing I can think of that will actually resolve this issue is asking for an account rollback to before you removed the sigil. Only you can decide if any progress lost in the process would be worth it though.

You can do bloodstone fen in 5-10 mins.

Reposting a troll post. You can do better, I believe in you

As a gw1 and gw2 player who leads a charr warband guild. Yay, we need more lore! Maybe some zones in blood legion territory?
---
said district was in DR, then was exchanged for "the great collapse", and is now the crown pavillion.
---
Player housing sounds to me like glorified home instances. How fun are those exactly? And since when was fishing fun?
---
My daughter is playing through, currently in chapter 2 of the Personal Story, but I can't tell you how long it is because she has large gaps in her play time.
---
What is now the Crown Pavilion in Divinity's Reach was previously the Great collapse (A giant hole).  Pre-release it was shown to be a Canthan district.  Naturally this sparked rumor.  This rumor has swirled for ages and I believe it has been debunked but I don't have a source. As for some kind of contract, that's a new one but the reasons you outline are the same as the old rumor.  Until A-Net comes out and says otherwise, I wouldn't put to much stock in hearsay.
---
Sorry my bad he said it was in DR I mixed it up, I will correct that. But the reason it was exchanged was not because of such a contract?
---
No it got abused by ppl switching character and the cooldown on the permanent teleport to friend gets reseted
---
Maybe. I've heard similar gosip aswell but if mixing the cultures is a no-no why not make it themed around only chinese architecture or only korean or just cheese it and go for japanese. If it was me though I'd say fuck all and make an indian or siberian themed expacs. STILL ASIA!!! Or why not mongolian. Why does it have to be chinese...
---
I haven't heard that.
---
Cantha was basicly generic Asia-land riddled with stereotypes and mashing all kinds of East-Asian cultures into one. To westerners it might seem just fine, but I can imagine that it being seen as a disrespectful caricature. This was why the Canthan district in DR was scrapped, and Cantha probably won't happen. Considering I'm a white guy from Western Europe, I don't feel like I or people like me are in a position to tell people who are from East Asia what is offensive/insensitive and what isn't.
---
Friend of a coworker basically told her the same thing too.** According to said friend, the Koreans and Chinese were not too happy to see their cultures mixed together as there's intense cultural pride. I imagine it'd be okay if they were two completely separate land masses, but if they're all jumbled together, you start ruffling feathers-especially government.
---
This is just a personal opinion, but I imagine that if Cantha were to become a thing again, Anet would basically have to scrub out all parts of eastern cultures from Cantha, pick **ONE** single culture and stick with it for all of Cantha.
---
** To be clear, said friend is an artist at Anet, coworker is a level designer where I work, and I'm a game designer.
---
Plus as an added bonus, Anet will probably buff axe damage next patch.  😁
---
I don't think the asura have gotten proper spotlight, either, honestly.
---
 I mean, "they solve every problem" isn't anywhere close to taking a good look at their culture, addressing social and political problems they have. etc. I would also love the charr and norn to get some proper focus, of course, but the idea that some people would suggest totally cheating the asura out of *real* focus just because of their status as perpetual science NPCs is really unfortunate. They don't really ever get the spotlight as a people. They just get a handwave of a mention whenever technology comes up, and that's not real content, IMO.
---
Flamethrower engineer is pretty all right
---
You hate AFK fishing. But that way of fishing is actually rather rare. Almost exclusive to "grinder" and "gear treadmill" mmos. 
---
Fishing is rarely an AFK activity in adventure and RPG games. It's usually a minigame that requires at least some skill and timing. Many fishing minigames even include things like 'biggest catch records', and unique rewards received for getting all the different fish in different locations across the game.
---
AFK fishing would definitely not be the way to do it in GW2. In GW2 it would have to be a minigame, not an AFK idle action, or automatic like gathering nodes.  
---
And it would probably have to require masteries, and include several collections of the different fish across each region.
---
Everyone starts somewhere. Doesn't mean he can't handle twitch mechanics.
---
Yeah but his minions will be a lot better-looking then.
---
Gw1 maybe cause it's the same engine?
---
-sarcasm intended-
---
Those are only for level 80s I think,
---
We could scrap like everything Asian related and stick with Luxons/Kurzicks. I'd be fine with that.
---
Zojja was effectively replaced by Taimi

So.. Final Fantasy XIV?

How does Nabkha compare to Tomb as a place to park alts? I see it brought up a lot, and the 3 big chests are nice, but Tomb has a bunch of little ones. Are they roughly equal, or does one come out ahead in the long run, anyone know?
---
Also looking for opinions on parking an alt at Matriarch vs simply efforting' my way up with a skyscale? I know that comes down to personal preference/how many available alts I have to park, just curious what others prefer.

No release in China?
---
At some point Felicia Day said she would LOVE to voice Zojja again, but she didn't get a call from Arenanet. 
---
Zojja was scripted in early projects to be kidnapped instead of Taimi in Daybreak, but they changed it. Most likely due the limit of characters they can bring. 
---
There were some hints that Zojja is in a very bad shape (in Season 4), and we had no messenger to be just keep updating us about her health. I mean... they have a time limit, and probably Zojja's plot was to big to fit in the whole plot of Joko and Kralkatorrik.
---
I am one of people that would LOOVE to have Zojja fighting against Kralkatorrik, but I guess Taimi and Gorrik were just too much of Asura ex machina. 
---
And to say it's the VA's fault, is so stupid.
---
Anet needs to use this to advertise GW2.
---
It kinda is territory control since buildings bring you points per tick (ppt), although kills also get you points (ppk).
---
Thing is that after so much time, most of the people don't actually play for the win in that given week as it's simply so state and for no reward.
---
What instead happens is trying to get fights. You know, good fights, where you don't steamroll the enemy are incredibly fun. Therefor commanders tend to prefer specific builds (look up on site Metabattle, look only at meta build if you don't have experience in wvw). 
---
Those builds work well together in achieving a victory, ofc a large part is also knowing how to play, but well, that comes with time (to really advance you need to join a wvw guild that does GvGs).
---
There is also roaming, that you can also see builds for on Metabattle, just a little further down that group builds. As a noob, you will have a hard time roaming solo as enemies will generally kill you. Might be better to go as a group, these a lot of times happen organically, or you can communicate with other players to do so.
---
As for blueprints, they are mostly used for getting walls/gates down, or to defend, but it's well, kinda boring tbh. Check them out on GW2 wiki "siege weapons". Mostly it's arrow cart for defense, ram for gate and cata for walls. It's considered poor form for some to use AC excesively as it deminishes the fun of simply having a fight.
---
Skirmishes are 2h long portions of a week long match. They generate points for the final score by looking at that skirmishes points. First gets 3 victory points, 2 -&gt; 1... If you open B, the bigger number is generaly score in a skirmish and smaller one is points in a match.
---
Can't you just drop the item of said inventory from server console? I'm pretty sure you can do that, because you can essentially wipe one's inventory/gold.
---
Damn.... Under 6 minutes wtf
---
I am ethnic Chinese and I can tell you I will happily see a fantasy Asian smorgasbord culture in-game. 
---
As do most players.
---
But there will always be a vocal portion in the playerbase with sticks lodged so far up their tailpipes, who are just determined to find something to be offended over. This being a fantasy setting aside, these people also seem to be ignoring the fact that there has been significant cultural influences both ways between China and Korea for centuries, socially, culturally and architecturally. To take offense over "mishmashing" Chinese and Korean architecture is overstating one's cultural identity, and frankly grossly exaggerating the issue.
---
Be careful. The "No CoNtEnT" Twitch crowd will be on you soon for daring to suggest that playing another game, when one isn't providing you with as much entertainment, is healthy and normal and something that has been done for decades. Take a break, try something else, come back when your interest is rekindled. 
---
Constantly expecting one activity to fulfill all your needs and wants is what leads to burnout. Though, apparently, when you suggest this to elements of the Guild Wars 2 playerbase you are being toxic.
---
&gt; there is no way of intentionally corrupting a character.
---
    DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
---
If you want to run high end fractals or raids you'll need to be a squishy. I run full harriers (healer) or zerk everywhere, yeah 2 hits and you are dead but sadly DPS is king. You dont need a tank if you can kill it fast enough and killing it fast means less phases, less mechanics and less chances of timing your dodge wrong which means insta-down or even straight up death even with full tank gear which can easily turn into a wipe as you are needed to say kite on siaxx, run greens on VG, you have claim on MO, you are a slug on sloth, pulls/push on sam, kite on demos etc. Less phases mean less screws ups.
---
I don’t understand how it is so much work to remove things such as particle effects on Elegy Armour though. Surely it can’t be that difficult. If it is that difficult then I can see why we still don’t have a more graphics options to limit particle effects in the game.
---
Yeah, God forbid a company that doesn't actually charge you to play the game tries to sell something to you in order to support themselves and further development of said game.
---
I am super into fashion wars, but I have never been even remotely tempted to purchase a mount skin. Why? Because though I use mounts all the time, I'm off and on them so fast that it hardly matters. I'm not rich, I don't have a lot of money to spend on the game anymore, but I don't see an issue with paying for something I want (or not, if it's something I can't afford). It doesn't affect my ability to play the game, it doesn't affect my enjoyment of the game, and frankly I am confused by people who get so irate over the audacity of a business to charge for a thing that people can choose to buy if they want it. Do you also go to the grocery store and tantrum because lettuce costs something? Or, if you're going to try to use the "virtual item" argument, do you go to the movies and tantrum because they try to charge you money for the privilege of seeing the movie?

It's called an Artifact Title. Guild Wars was named for the Guild vs Guild gameplay that remained the focus through factions.
---
They changed the VA for Rox to take her in a "new direction" then did nothing with her.  #notmyrox.
---
There are a million things to do in this game. Player housing and fishing would be nice bonuses, sure, but you know damn well that if they add those people are still going to complain that they're just adding "time-wasting" stuff and not "real content".
---
Humans aren't that original.  
---
Everything in fantasy is a mix of other things.  Just look at dragons, a hodgepodge of animal parts.
---
What makes things feel more original is the size of the pieces that compose it. The larger the pieces you put together, the easier it is to recognize the whole as a mix. The smaller they are, the more they seem like a new thing. 
---
To get the 'far east' feel of Shing Jea and Kaineng without making it feel like a mix of architectural elements, they would have to break them down and make never seen before things with the pieces.
---
Of course, they could always skip that, nuke Kaineng and Shing Jea by washing them away with the deep sea elder dragon, and focus on the Gothic and forest themes of Echovald, and the Mediterranean and Polynesian themes of the Jade Sea.
---
more open world maps with events? yeah
---
what is "real" content? raids which are played by ~5% of the community?
---
You don't have that long history, thanks.
---
Yeah exactly what I wrote except not.
---
I keep saying we need better combat rhythm that it's easier to follow by new players and spectators to make the game more appealing to new audiences.  
---
Look at all the cool things viewers could see in stream that they can't see because everyone is spamming them way too fast, and with quickness on top of that.
---
For example, in PvP we could have a 'death cam' replaying at slow motion the last few seconds of combat after being defeated while you wait to rejoin the fight. Spectators would be able to see the death cams by pressing the corresponding in the kill reel.  
---
Quickness could change from stacking in duration to intensity, making it a 'burst boon' that players stack before coordinating an attack, rather than something they intent to keep up at all times.
---
And what's the other 20, then?
---
This game dps is broken as fuck.
---
Too bad in any realistic ingame scenario there's no way to see this because of how much crappy particle effects they use. Even in slow-mo it's hard to see the animation because of all the flashes sometimes, less alone when you have 5 characters overlapping each other.
---
For all the good their artists do, there's equal amounts of shooting themselves in the foot.
---
Keep in mind that learning to play can be quite a bump for many people, especially if they’ve never played a video game before. Lots of people struggle with controlling both their avatar and the camera at the same time. 
---
As a MMO, GW2 is a very complex game even if you already know how the basic controls work. To ease the introduction, you could try some low pressure games for getting used to controlling an avatar before going into GW2. Someone in this thread already mentioned Life is Strange, in addition Portal could be good as it’s very environment centered and could work for learning to navigate in a virtual environment.
---
How common is it to have Condi Renegade in Raids and Fractals? 
---
The layout seems like a lot of fun, but I don't know if it is worth the effort if there are better options like Firebrand (?)
---
Unequipping and re-equipping the tools from the shared slots is *still* far less annoying and less time-consuming than having to go back to a merchant to purchase more orichalcum tools every time you run out, though (or, alternately, constantly having to pay attention to how much you have, or carrying tons of extras around in your bags on every character).
---
Copperfed and unbreakable tools of some variety in the shared slots are the biggest quality-of-life improvements that you can make for yourself in this game, IMO. Especially if you play a lot of alts.
---
I all, I need to do the Serpent's Ire meta in the Domain of Vabbi for the inquest backpack collection but it is one that is virtually impossible to solo and is a completely dead meta atm. Are there any groups that do it at certain times or what is the best way to get a group together?
---
No, guild wars was named after the, you guessed it, Guild Wars, which happened before GW1 Prophecies. The name is purely Lore derived. Guilds were never more or less focus in GW, at least not more than in other MMOs. It's literally just a lore title.
---
You Sir are a prime example.
---
The keys are just a nice side bonus, IMO. The boost, the slot, and the unbreakable tools are what makes the package worth it if you need those things. The bag slots and keys are just icing.
---
Intensity stacking quickness does not sound like a good time to me. I just imagine pressing a skill and the damage numbers just appearing with just barely the start of an animation playing. Doesn't sound satisfying at all.
---
No, it isn't. The Guild Wars lore event was made up to justify the title after the game's feature creep changed the focus to emphasize PvE over the GvG core it was originally built around.
---
GW2 has amazing art and graphic design.  It's a shame that it's so wasted when you need such a powerful processor to render more than 15-20 players on your screen with more than 30-40 FPS.  Performance is one of the big reasons why I don't really enjoy open world anymore.  Playing in new maps and areas is fun until you have to force the game to limit player quantity to medium or less.  It's kind of a visual kaleidoscope, and only getting artistic value out of the engine in solo-play or small-group just kind of sucks...
---
Bad in Fracs as it has little burst and higher rampup time
---
Wait - PvP, Sorry I thought you was on about PvE.
---
What mode are we talking about here, WvW?
---
In general, the wiki is a great resource.
---
&gt;There are sometimes items like trinkets I have that cannot be sold and when I unequip them I cannot disassemble them with those kits you buy from merchants, so I just destroy them for space. I'm wondering if there is some other way I don't know of that you can benefit from them without having to destroy them
---
Most of them can just delete, but that's a pretty vague category of items.
---
&gt;I was in the summer event where you run around looking for loot bags and one of the vendors had an item for sale that's a crystal to be placed in your "home instance" to mine once a day. What is this home instance? I almost finished the Zaitan story so perhaps accessing it happens after that?
---
Home instance is five similar areas that can are in the racial capitols and have special portals to enter. If you're human, it's the gate in DR to Salma district. The home instance for your race is where a lot of story steps for your character take place, but it's always available to enter.
---
&gt;I saw people running around as other races and found out about "endless kodan tonic". How exactly do I get access to this item since when I go to the portal to the area the kodan tells me "I'm not ready for that journey"?
---
Bitterfrost Frontier is from A Crack in the Ice in season 3. Essentially, it's a DLC map that was given out free at its launch but now requires a gemstore buy.
---
&gt;In the Heart of Thorns area are all mastery point locations(where you get 10 hero points to finish my elite spec.) possible to do alone? I was at one and the monsters overwhelmed me, so I failed to earn it(maybe I need better gear?)
---
Several of the Hero Points in Heart of Thorns are not intended to be solo'd. The Path of Fire ones, however, are fine.
---
&gt;The teleporting points are somewhat pricey sometimes since I only have 10 gold. Is there a way to make a few gold quick, so I don't have to worry about using these frequently?
---
Just doing three daily achievements yields 2 gold each day, enough to cover teleports.
---
&gt;What "powerful world bosses" are NOT soloable? I've seen some with silver circles, gold circles, shapes around the image, etc.
---
Just about everything that spawns in normally (vets, elites, even some harder bounties) are soloable. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_boss Here's a list of group fight world bosses in the core game which are all on timers. Heart of Thorns has a lot of meta events, and Path of Fire has a few meta events plus a lot of group bounty bosses to go hunting that are not great to solo.
---
&gt;Last question, I have over 60 bags(account bound) that can be turned into lots of gear. Normally I just disassemble the gear from these with the kits and get lots of materials, but I don't know if normally it's best to actually sell these on the trading post vs disassembling them.
---
Depends on the actual bag itself. For example, Unidentified gear is always better to open, salvage gear, and sell the materials. But items like Bag of Gear are sometimes better to sell, because your profit opening them as a Lv. 80 is far lower than someone who has a lower level character to manipulate mat. drops.

---
It really is great, but may I ask what dyes did you use on that Skyscale in 0:11? It looks stunning!
---
&gt;We had a Cantha district. It was built out. It was polished. It was beautiful. We kept getting feedback about the Asian market. And everyone was having a problem with it because the Chinese don't like having their architecture mixed with Koreans and the Koreans don't like having their architecture with the Chinese. And of course it's fantasy smorgosbord. It's gothic mixed with Nordic mixed with ... that's just the way fantasy works. But not over there apparently. So it got to the point where we were like ... well, what do we do with this spot? We don't have time to rebuild from scratch, so we just nuked it.
---
I *think* this is all that was said.
---
The only things this awesome video is missing is Arc Divider and the final AA chain attack of Holosmith Sword/Weaver Air Sword.
---
Yes definitely should have showcased the spin with weaver. Watching your weapons spin around you animated so well is awesome.
---
The idea that it is a VA problem is entirely player speculation. Both Anet and Felicia have said that it isn't the case.
---
Unfortunately, I can't find the pre-release coverage from 15 years ago. But it should be pretty obvious from circumstantial evidence still around today. Notably, no game has ever been named after a "lore event in the past". Especially not from a Blizzard successor studio.
---
So I can be disappointed by people like you, while also making me realize my superiority over you. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I’m glad that they’re aware of the norn problem! But I worry when they say “norn and charr”. Is it selfish to just want the norn on their own? They’ve been neglected enough.
---
&gt; Fuck me,
---
It's a stingray
---
Asura are hardly a handwave. They've been present in nearly every story since launch. Even HoT, was was ostensibly the "Sylvari" expansion, ended up having more Asura than Sylvari with Rata Novus.
---
The real problem is that, like personal stories, Anet doesn't have the resources to do anything but conglomerate all their resources onto one metanarrative that can be vaguely applied to all of the races. It's hopping from one dragon to the next with Norn. Charr, and Sylvari stories all being dropped. Humans were used as a backdrop for PoF which was nice. Asura are Anet's magic wand to create ad solve every problem. It's true that Asura haven't had a proper spotlight in terms of what's actually meaningful to their race, but that goes for nearly every other race as well. In that context - knowing that the story can only use races as a backdrop in order to appeal to everyone - Asura are way overdone and Norn are top of the list for "does anyone remember us?"
---
I would consider that part of security / devops. General rule of thumb should be no touchy the live DB.
---
I've recorded everything at 90fps 1920x1080 60mbps meaning I had to make sure the game ran at 100+ fps at all times because a single frame drop under 90 would mess things up a lot.
---
Then depending on the shot I slowed it back down to somewhere between 15 and 30 fps and interpolated back to 60.
---
Maybe I'll write a basic howto guide later.
---
All it does is showcase the amount of hard work they put into fluid animations.
---
That's cool, thanks
---
Aww I was hoping to see dual axe  Astralaria on a Ranger. Axe 5 is the reason I made Astralaria.
---
I have to say, I think it's absolutely amazing to see you guys still going so passionately and strong. Keep at it &lt;3
---
What CPU do you have?
---
yeah for like 3 or four story missions per day, likely 3 days per week or so, i could see it taking months easily.
---
When the mmo market is so bad that people get hyped about a 15 year old rerelease.
---
Damn, that's a whole new level of epicness I'd love to see in the game.
---
thanks for the help.
---
You can not appreciate how gorgeous these particles are at normal speeds. The trailing looks so magical
---
can u introduce some GW2 PVP YouTube channels?
---
Yeah that would do, forgot about "new" boxes.
---
God I hope not, they're the worst race in GW2. The *only* they have going for them is being mysterious. They're just hot topic elves with fins hot glued on their backs.

Would be limited to the next skill only. It could also follow a balanced formula, like one stack would reduce the cast time of the **next skill** to 0.75 of the original time, two stacks to 0.5, three stacks to 0.35, etc.

I expected heavy human female meta in slow-mo, and was pleasantly surprised. Please do more!

True, you only have to:

-write the lore

-check it with the rest of the timeline

-create npc lore backgrounds for it
---
-create dialogue around it
---
-maybe even voiceact it

On the top of my hat, i'd say Dragon age. Though i have to say i'm not totally familiar with the lore, but i'm kinda sure the "dragon age" was in the past when the series started
---
All dragon minions can spread corruption. It's one of the dragon champions' duties to spread and corrupt more beings. This, of course, extends to branded as well:
---
&gt;**Centurion Bloodfist:** *A number of* [*Iron Legion*](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Iron_Legion) *regulars went missing just north of our current position.*  
---
&gt;

&gt;**Centurion Bloodfist:** *The legion sent a search party.*  
---
&gt;**Sentinel Whiptail:** *Let me guess. They went missing, too.*  
---
&gt;**Centurion Bloodfist:** *No, they came back the very next day—as* [*Branded*](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Branded)*, bringing destruction to the Legion's rear defenses.*

---
Your post made me realize that the excuse about mixing architecture seems like complete bullshit. Yes each country has differences but due to history there are also plenty of mixing between them already.
---
Black Desert Online has quite extensive and involving side stuff for players to do and some of it is pretty fun. Some enjoy it, others do not. The instanced player housing is pretty well done compared to LOTRO's instanced version but none come close to what Ultima Online did with housing. Though I could not tell you where now but sometime within a year before GW2's launch housing was mentioned and it is what caught my attention to this game. While I enjoy PvE and some WvW I am and probably always will be a deco queen at heart and would love to see GW2 do housing IF they did it right... somewhere between UO and BDO with GW2's own stamp. Fishing isn't that big of a deal to me but I can see where some would enjoy it. Anyhow, just my humble two cents worth. Good day all :D
---
&gt;Every dragon champion and lieutenant has the ability to corrupt others to grow the dragon minion army for their Elder Dragon master. Some dragon-corrupted artifacts can do this over time too as we saw in the Kellach story in human personal story chapter 3 where the dragon crystal slowly corrupted Corporal Kellach into a Risen.
---
Correction: Kellach was turned into a risen by an Orrian sword (we can see him wielding it). The dragon crystals turned into amulets were spread by Necromancer Rissa.
---
i also started FFXIV but tbh i found it looks really bad.. and the combat is awfully boring. yea everyone says it gets so much better in the endgame.. but i cant see me reaching it because i die of boredom before.
---
but i like the class/job system and the extra inventory for gear and questitems
---
and, y'know, *no new content*
---
[You just lack the correct sound track](https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/1156600931007569920)
---
Indeed, I should've used the word artifact there instead, but my mind went back to Rissa and poor Howl's plot. It would be interesting to see more of these kinds of artifacts spreading the dragons' corruption in future storylines after we saw a few of these in the personal story. :)
---
Why piece of shit like you still breathing?
---
i honestly wait for the moment they realize how bad WoW was at that time and leave :D
---
Rumour on the street is Anet is a lazy ass company.... just a rumour though....
---
Have you tried a different class or job? You can freely switch to whatever you want on a single character, and leveling a new job gets a boost in exp based on the delta between your current job and your highest level job. 
---
What I’ve found is that I really enjoy support. Started with pugilist, decided to try white mage, then decided to try arcanist which becomes a scholar (healer) or summoner (dps) at level 30. Dungeon runs are a lot of fun on the scholar, I’ve gone from level 30-35 in about an hour and a half just from doing dungeons, the queue is basically instant for healers.
---
Yeah, WoW Classic will probably be much closer to StarCraft: Remastered than OldSchool RuneScape in terms of updates
---
The animations in this game really are the best among mmorpgs
---
They are not dead. Read most upvoted comments what you should do
---
If people get exited about old content more than they do for new, apply same logic for gw2, y'know maybe the content the things you consider content, such as raids, are fundomentally designed badly...just saying...
---
I understand cultural pride and history, but takin it so far to complain about a fantasy video game's environment design is just asinine. Cultural pride and history are not unique to east Asia, and (as an example) we don't see anyone protesting Elona being a smorgasbord of Arabic, Persian, Indian and Coptic/Egyptian styles.
---
People need to stop imagining games and other types of artistic expression are trying to distort or insult a specific culture. Cantha is not the Tyrian word for China or Korea: it's the Tyrian word for "East Asia". Better?
---
It really does not matter which studio. If you're gonna narrow the parameters down like that, there's bo sense in trying. It's like saying: name another game studio that ends their RTS-franchises with -craft.
---
To be honest it starts to sound like your grasping at straws here.
---
Maybe Primus's My Name is Mud?
---
I'm a big fan of what you do by the way, I wish there were a way to better integrate the work you did with the interactive Tyrian Map into an overlay you can use in game so that World Explorers like my self can get more detailed information when we walk into a POI.  
---
So I really hate to be that guy but do you have any hints regarding season 5, or an inkling about what might be discussed at the end of august; hell just one clue could trigger a 40 minute Woodenpotatoes speculation video ;D.
---
Again, please cite the sources. Because it was always a PvE focused game since it's release. The added two major new mechanics for guilds in factionsn thats true. But they also added 4 new PvE Areas with a lot of smaller zones, PvE missions, two new pve hardcore Areas and two new classes ( which could be used for both modes)
---
So well it does sound like the PvE was actually the focus and not the GvG
---
Fun fact: I sometimes check LFG for people asking for help, and quite often someone joins them before I can even react. It's crazy.

How bout wait till the August 30th info before starting this
---
Reaper to unleash death and destruction to some  annoying enemies (looking at you hot/pof enemies)
---
Firebrand to lead and command enemies into puts of despair!!!!!!
---
Thank you actually. Hope there's actually something there, still breaking their schedule yet again tho.
---
that's one way of framing it
---
another is that activision/blizzard realized they were always going to have to deal with private/pirate servers popping up and instead of spending the money in legal they could try to offer it themselves to cash in on some nostalgia sales and maybe even hook in some subs (since the sub is good for both classic and current iirc). i mean shit you're complaining about class balance in GW2 but it was so much worse in vanilla wow than any other MMO I've played. are you trying to say people *want* that? you sound like a drunk uncle ranting about whatever new thought popped into your head mid-sentence
---
i don't think people are hype for old shit so much as they're hype for a chance to live through their nostlagia. besides it's not like gw2 is even immune to this: people wanted SAB to come back super hard for a long time. It came back, people were like yay and then they bounced off of it super hard because they had nothing new to do with it. people talk about how much they want old LA back as if they're going to spend all their time there, but you know that ultimately it wouldn't matter to them.
---
the novelty factor of bringing back something old probably won't last all that long
---
Playing monster hunter world atm and dota underworlds while doing fractals/dailies and raids if I can find the time and a group in LFG
---
still need that envoy armor achievement 2!
---
I bought a Spooky Raptor a long time ago and I used to ride it around NP.  But now, nothing shows up in the mount hot bar next to elite skill.  Keybinds were all reset to default.  I used to have a mount keybind mod installed but can't remember anything about it now so I deleted it but still no mount.  Probably have to reinstall the whole client cus of that mount mod screwed up something.
---
yeah after the live stream you can wait another month for them to release it lol
---
I wouldn't say a month but I expect at least 2 weeks really, and that's once again quite disheartening.
---
Haven't jumped into wvw yet
---
Tibetan architecture would also be really cool, imo. They have some really interesting, unique, styles when it comes to art, too.
---
You're not wrong. O.o
---
i miss most of the animations because i play at max zoom out at a 90' angle from behind.
---
i hope the whole elder dragon story will end fast or we get better more interesting villains. the dragons are just so incredible boring. Joko, Balthasar and Scarlet are great exemplas how villains should be written.
---
That would be a tad too much.
---
They could change Fury into a boon that makes the next attack a 100% guaranteed crit instead a flat 20% if they wanted to remove the random aspect of criticals, replacing it with a more action-based approach, like positioning. Like how you do more damage with headshots in an FPS, but with a different approach, like flanking attacks and attack from the back, and recharging effects from traits, upgrades and skills.   
---
That could be doable over time with a series of small changes to reduce the impact, or all in one go with a huge overhaul of combat mechanics that shake things up a lot, including new specializations. 
---
But quickness has mostly three uses: Acting faster so the enemy has less time to react, reducing the window of opportunity to interrupt you, and basically flat DPS increase. 
---
Making it work for a single skill only would be a huge leap down in power. 
---
Making it stack in intensity could more of the power, and allow reducing power creep over a longer period of time so it doesn't impact as much, but it'll require more skill and coordination when in a party, to do it together.
---
So basically you are worried about things we have no idea that will happen, being your imagination, but you consider them as obvious facts.
---
Why you post this?

This game has by far, the most unique and good looking art, animation and attention to detail. I'm not just saying it because I play it. I've been playing MMOs since 2003. I play Eve-online, WoW, ESO, SWTOR, and many other MMOs. Yes, BDO has insane graphics, but it's a garbage of a game. I dont really care about Final Fantasy series, because I'm a bit older, and I care less about hentai and insane spell sizes. To me, GW2 has the most wholesome experience. One of the best and engaging mount systems. Great open world questing. An engaging WVW, if they pay more attention to it, and an actual underwater environment. Sure it has room to improve, but this game has originality. That's something 90% of MMO market lacks.
---
Who said *obvious facts*? Is it wrong to theorize about the story? Everyone's free to theorize about it until August 30, I don't see how that is wrong.
---
The actual announcement was about the live letter, and no there are not "dozens" of posts about that. 
---
&gt; Never anywhere did they say that after Season 4 ends, a new season would start 2-3 months later.
---
That's just picking up at strawsm they actually said 2-3 months between LW updates, LW updates don't care for seasons. If anyone is trying to point a lie it's yourself by trying to shift their narrative.  
---
But carry on, I assure you of one thing tho, I've seen this kind of shit before and it's not going to end well, I 100% assure you of that, and the fact that they think that, for some reason, they did not need an expansion this time around just shows how disconnected they are, but I guess if you guys keep deleting posts that slightly mention these issues they'll never actually give a shit.
---
Not being able to move the UI doesn't help.
---
Most of the time the angle that I like the most for ranged combat with action camera also puts the enemy HP bar and portrait straight on top of all the action, as I want to keep the enemy at the top of the screen to have in camera all the things between them and me.
---
I am returning to the game for the first time in about a year. I've never finished a legendary, although I had started on nevermore and meteorlogicus before I took my one year break. Meteorlogicus has stage 1 completed, but should I continue working on this legendary, or go ahead and create Xiuquatl first instead? I want to get both of them at some point...
---
you get a cookie for this one 🍪
---
This video alone convinced two of my friends to finally give gw2 a try. Thanks and great job!! :)
---
Compare it to 2017 as well and you see that it's right in line. I thought people might have a point with the % discounts being lower, but it looks like, so far, 2018 was an aberration.
---
29/50 people in squad joined to help in a 5 player dungeon.
---
Remake it completely Japanese (Who share enough style aspects from both to keep major aspects recognizable IMO) and flip the finger at the others.  
---
Oh but the outfits and style points many westerners (Including me) aren't intimately familiar with are different?  It's been a minute.  **It's been 250 years worth of minutes in a fantasy culture.**
---
I disagree personally. Especially Scarlett and Balthazar were super uninteresting to me. The dragon backplot is the only thing that made things interesting.
---

I swear, the sub's community seems to be getting worse every day. Like basic reading comprehension is out the window now. The items and % sales are in line with almost every other year. Consider that, in 2016, ANet had the BALLS to try and sell \*Merchant Expresses\* at a discount. Can you imagine the number of pants that would be shat if that had happened this year?
---
There was also the sword ambush skill, where the character was weilding a Bolt. The Bolt animation trail on that is awesome to watch
---
Season 3 had 4 villains Caudecus, Lazarus (Balthazar), Primordus and Jormag as well as real Lazarus so lets make that 5.
---
yeah make them even more useless, guilds are already a joke since you can be in so many at the same time, why would you even want that, you should only be able to be in one guild, why would you be in 5, it's so meaningless
---
That and I'm sure you don't want to piss off ANet either.
---
Won't be as good as the gem store one released within a week of the first player getting the new legendary mount skin that uses all the new legendary tech.
---
Yes, let's make Guilds more obsolete by being able to join more!
---
They already have returned to dormant state in Flashpoint. It gives Anet an opportunity to take a break from Elder Dragons for a while, or at least turn to Bubbles.
---
We could just be killing champions and take on the other one next season/expansion. Or try to kill both in the last episode, since they're each other's weakness, and only one dies, makes the other one insanely powerful and becomes the major villain for the next season/expansion.
---
I wonder how the balance of the game would be if every skill had double the cast/animation times...
---
This type of response means you have Z E R O valid points in your argument, and it clarifies that your “suggestions” are just requests based on emotion, and there is no thoughtful logic to anything you have suggested. Thats too bad, to be honest.
---
And wild star player housing was fun, but the problem lies with you, the player, not knowing how to create fun in the world without anet handing you a new collection. 
---
Just curious,  have you completely maxed out your home instance? Do you have a guild hall at max level? Is it decorated to hell and back? Did you do it by yourself?
---
That's just any sword movement skill, mirage axe 2 is unique.
---
This is incorrect. The installer does give a files remaining amount as well as a percentage. I know, I've had to reinstall the game recently.
---
Well, which one do you want first? Legendaries are almost entirely about bragging rights and skins - the stat change facility is just a bonus.
---
WvW guild, PvE guild, RP guild, Raid guild, PvP guild  ...
---
Which just proves that the VA is not the problem.
---
To be fair, [some things](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/541ktw/something_weird_is_happening_in_my_animal/) in Animal Crossing seem to be a bit off.
---
So basically there is stuff in the game you HAVEN’T done, but you want to bitch about there being “nothing else to do” 
---
See how that doesn’t quite hold up?
---
Home instance nodes can be acquired through VM and UM, not to mention all the home instance cats- pretty fun collection.
---
Guild halls are for ANYONE who wants a customizable instance, and you can easily find a guild who needs more people to decorate a guild hall. Train artificer and get’er done. 
---
Finally, consider the reasons why you just said you wouldn’t max home instance or GH, and tell me those types of restrictions wouldn’t be present if anet implemented player housing? 
---
See the whole argument fall apart at the seams. Logic trumps emotion.
---
It’s been so long since I played a Norn (had norn ranger at launch). You can’t fight when shifted though can you!?
---
I'm thinking more along the lines of which one is faster to create. I'm not sure I want one before the other.
---
You can. But it only lasts 15s or so.
---
This recreation within GW2 is brilliant and I want to see what else you can pull off with other memes.
---
We only really need 3: PvE guild, WvW guild, and PvP guild.
---
Then have an virtually unlimited number of a different type of grouping that doesn't have guild features. You could it groups, assemblies, companies, societies (like the Tyrian Explorer's Society), etc.
---
No need for an entire guild system with guild halls and decorations and levels and upgrades for people to get together just for fractals, or getting achievements done, or daily Tequatl runs.  These 'groups' would be just a roster of players, a list of messages set by the manager of the group, a description and descriptive tags for the LFG panel so people can search for your group, and a few simple permissions so those managing the group can get rid of troublemakers. And that'll be it.
---
They would not have a 500 player limit like guilds, but their chat would split in sub-groups of 500 once they pass 500, since there's probably a technical limitation. 
---
Players would be still limited to 5 chat channels, but you'd choose which ones among all the guilds an groups you belong to. 
---
Like the "Communities" in Diablo III, if you've seen them.
---
Hopefully the rest of us won't have to suffer through these GW1 trips anymore. Freaking Cantha expansion ideas..
---
Is this happening in PvE openworld, PvP or WvW?
---
If WvW, this is very normal, though Anet won't acknowledge it, even on their own streams.
---
yougotme.gif
---
Plus the work associated with it.
---
Them casually Walking like that in the beginning of the video just reminds me of those retarded game ad's on Facebook "BEST FREE BROWSER MMO THIS YEAR! PLAY IT NOW! HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!"
---
Clearly there's going to be a contest. Only the top 4 people of those 25 will be allowed in the dungeon.
---
Would you say those skills are...
---
bearly used?
---
This was a good read, I appreciate the explanation :)
---
That animation is literally copied from Deadeye, and is included in this video. The reason the mirage has the "arm-cross" is because the animation is designed to be done while holding a rifle
---
It's not that deep. The game design promotes teamwork and avoids pitting players against each other (in PvE, for the most part) so naturally people will be nice.
---
I love how much details anet puts in every single animation 😭😭💕💕
---
Except it's always been like this, even back in 2012.  
---
Nothing new, really.
---
I like to think that GW2's gameplay and design is heavily encouraging this kind of behaviour. This game isn't not about endless grind to reach max level. There is no such thing as "XP wasting". If you "stop" for a moment to give directions or just to chat with a player who crossed your road, it's fine. You're not missing anything. No one will steal your spot. No one will steal your loot.  
---
As far as I can remember, the community being *generally* helpful and friendly has always been the case. Honestly I don't see any relation between the lack of new content (even if I can agree on this being an issue at the moment) and the willingness to help other players.
---
Kralk and Morde both did tho. Even zhaitan via his minions.
---
The biggest problem is IMO their constant sidelining and conveniently forgetting them as threats.
---
They explicitly said Dragons will always be a main focus.
---
Maybe the design choices in development about reducing reasons for players to not want to see other players is the big reason. This isnt wow or other mmos where resource nodes are first come first serve, or mobs only yield loot or count for quests to the first player/party that tags them. So seeing other players in game is less of a "shit they are here to compete with me for resources" and more "this player and I can work together to get the rewards"
---
I know you have a bone to pick with anet and gw2 but dont let that cloud your judgement to much.
---
Zhaitan - Cold mastemind who only goes stronger the more errors his adversaries make. Kind of like Joko but then it is a common undead trope. His need for once-living troops makes him the most obvious first target.
---
Mordremoth - Infinite reach, creates his own people and has them serve him as a deity.
---
Kralkatorrik - Confused, raging lone grandpa who got betrayed by everyone - tears everything asunder but seems to care very little about his 'byproducts'.
---
Jormag - Sell-your-soul manipulator who will keep you alive and give you power if you come willingly (or are coerced into submission, as long as the contract is signed he doesn't care how).
---
Primordius - Destroyer using stone and lava to make destroyers customized to the exact thing he wants destroyed. Destroys things with much destruction but little is known of him besides that.
---
Bubbles - Mandatory tentacled horror whom everyone dreams of fighting in a Canthan setting for some reason. No known champions though Zhu Hanuku fits the bill pretty well. Motivations unknown.
---
I can tell them apart quite well.
---
It's just A combination of mostly 3 things: 
---
* Helping is easy: You don't need specific skills or items to revive other players, and you get exp for doing it.  With the Pact Commander masteries, you'll do it faster on lower level players.
---
* Being an asshole is hard: You can't PK, you can't kill steal, you can't node ninja... people who can't enjoy themselves unless it's at the expense of other players either stay in WvW and PvP, or just leave the game. 
---
* Helping is the best way to show off. In this game you get quickly to max level, and to top stat gear. Once you hit that, you don't do things faster and better by grinding gear or levels anymore, but by getting better at it. A jumping mesmer can get to the end of a jumping puzzle in a few hops and drop portals for others, a very skilled player can solo dungeons and show off by letting others tag along. A defeated player overwhelemed by several stacked enemy parties of mordrem, awakened or forged will see more experiences palyers come along and mow them down like they are nothing.
---
Scepter auto and mirage axe 2.
---
The mentors didn't only come back during combat, and even when they did it was during a pause in the fight so you can notice it.
---
Gameplay is more than just running, dodging and activating skills. Pretty much anything is gameplay as long as it's interactive. Eir's funeral contains plenty of gameplay without needing combat. Dialogue can very easily be gameplay. Every single one of the games I mentioned is an example of how story can be told through gameplay, and some of them don't have any combat in the game at all.
---
Braham's reaction in A Crack in the Ice is about one of the worst written bits in the game, yes, but that doesn't represent the entirety of the game's storytelling by any measure.
---
Is there anything actually different between original wow and classic?
---
Honestly, I think that's sword 2 on warrior but they share the same animation.
---
\*Slaps hood\* You can fit so many Sylvari in here!
---
&gt;Either way, I'm not so sure that madness is the inevitable fate of those who take too much magic. For one reason or another, the Elder Dragons became too greedy. Maybe it's that madness that drove the insanity, but from how it seems, Kralkatorrik was far greedier than the rest (another potential reason why Kralkatorrik was driven insane by magic but not the others if they go that odd route).
---
To be honest I always suspected the torment that Kralk faced was entirely based on the aspect of the dragon itself.  Kralk, like the other crystal dragons, had visions of the future.  Glint states that it is kralks desire to remain in existance that drives its madness, and that it caught a glimpse of the world without itself.  It seemed more likely that, with the torment predating the absorption of the other elder dragons, the fact that Kralk has a tendency to recieve incomplete visions of the future was the cause, and that the other magics that were absorbed served to exacerbate the issue.
---
I had a weird fascination with this movie in how it completely creeped the shit outta me but I loved it dearly. Special place in my heart.
---
I don't understand what makes it meaningless to be in multiple guilds lmao. It's not like I'm signing up to join a team in some competitive event on a tournament roster or some shit, it's just a semi-private group chat that you can make ingame?
---
Also I think you're forgetting the fact that people make guilds for personal storage vaults.
---
When there's nothing to do in the game that you check the LFG and just wait for someone that needs help so you can actually do something.
---
I honestly cannot wait for August 30th. I'm hopeful that Anet will deliver something great for us.
---
I don't like those because you can't use them in dungeons, only open world. Planks you can use anywhere you want unless it completely prohibits use of all consumables, like WvW and raids.
---
Well, Mordremoth you can hear if you are Sylvari and it goes beyond eating. Even Scarlet reveled in the idea of shaping a new world.
---
Zhaitan 'speaks by the mouth of his minions' and while his warlord tendancies leads him to delegate most of the work to officers the Mouths and Eyes at least have been presented as parts of him.
---
Plus, we got no hint that minions were not directly controlled by their corresponding dragons (and plenty of the opposite, like the fact that Zhaitan knew everything his minions knew). If the minions do what the master wants, then what the minions do is indicative of the master's will.
---
The 'primal force we cannot reasoned with' sort of collapsed with Kralkatorrik's end. Both because we got to hear something intelligible from the grandpa but also because Aurene seemed very reasonable even in Elder Dragon form.
---
So what we have is: Zhaitan wanted to eat. Mordremoth to reshape. Kralkatorrik to corrupt everything (but it was only a part of him somehow?). The others we know less.
---
I liked the idea of uncaring eldritch horrors best but what we have now seems far from that to me.
---
Credit to the amazing Animation designers at Anet! There are so many Beautiful Animations...
---
That does make sense to a degree, but it relies on a core emotion that Kralkatorrik claims to lack: fear. Knowing a future only leads to madness if one fears some aspect of the future and actively tries (and repeatedly fails) to avoid it. Though I suppose it could work going on the inverse of that: that rather than fearing the "bad outcome", he so strongly desires the "good outcome" but repeatedly fails to achieve it.
---
All things considered, I had figured that what Kralkatorrik didn't like about the future he saw wasn't him not being part of the world, but rather the notion of mortals and dragons co-existing. His sane self showed a deep care and regret for his family (particularly Glint and Aurene), and was at peace with the notion of his death. If he truly didn't fear anything, then it would make sense that Glint misinterpreted why Kralkatorrik wanted to avoid the future he saw, leaving what he didn't want to be "peace".
---
This even makes sense going into his Torment's personality: if Kralkatorrik drove to consume more magic, thus giving birth to his Torment, due to the desire to prevent peace (e.g., cause hostility), then it seems logical the form his Torment would take is the desire to control and/or destroy all things.
---
It would also make sense that the other Elder Dragons are affected by conflicting magics and drawn to torment because of Aurene - Kralkatorrik claimed she was a new kind of dragon. While he could be meaning "new kind of crystal dragon", I don't think Glint was close to being driven insane by her visions of the future (nor Vlast either), which leads me to think he's referring to all "high dragons" (Elder Dragons and their scions).
---
Either way, it all boils down to: was Glint wrong about Kralkatorrik fearing his vision, or was Kralkatorrik lying about not fearing anything?
---
The former makes more sense to me, since it would explain why Mordremoth was so narcissistic and confident even at the very end when he was on death's door.
---
I think I've contracted a venereal disease through the internet, by reading this comment on reddit. Fuck.
---
Actually for me it's that the game itself doesn't really do a great job of teaching itself. People who come from other games often expect quest hubs and breadcrumb trails. Particularly starting out, a lot of people who have been spoodfed go here do this, go there do that are lost. I see this all the time. This game does things very differently.
---
As a community guy I'm always going to put back into the community in any game I play.  But here it's almost more like a requirement.
---
Plus I remember a long time ago, when Hearts of the North came out in Guild Wars Beyond content in Guild Wars 1, the devs made the scavenger hunt ridiculously hard, with no in game clues. People complained about having to go to the wiki.
---
The devs said, at the time, they wanted the community to come together and talk and sort of work out this stuff together, rather than just give those clues in game. So I'm just carrying that logic forward, thinking the game, the community and my enjoyment of the game will be stronger if I help out.
---
I still have plenty of stuff I want to do, which doesn't mean I'm in a rush to do it.
---
Honestly here is what Anet needs to do, add new core tyria mastery lines, one for each playable race, doing the mastery line would give you access to other races race abilities, does it make sense lorewise or whatever no but honestly who cares.
---
&lt;Looks at dungeons, raids, fractals, collections, mastery points, dynamic events, adventure events, crafting, legendary crafting, map completion, world hidden and not so hidden chests, jumping puzzles, achievements... all that in deep confusion.&gt;
---
You should get the staff animations for charr revenant! It is soooo cool.
