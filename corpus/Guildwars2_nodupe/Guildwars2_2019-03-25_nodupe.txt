There could be a work around depending on where ANet would place the Ooze Tonic.

It's an MMO, I suggest you get used to the idea of leaving when something comes up. 
---
The CoF farm isn't something that will shut down if you suddenly have to go, they can just put an lfg for another player. 
---
You being afk for a few minutes will also do nothing if your fellow players aren't complete asses.
---
The CoF farm is flat out the best farm you can do, if you actually want to do it for longer periods, nothing else will come even close and it doesn't even need that much attention. 
---
You get [these](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Encoded_Orders) from bandits around the world, doubleclick and clear the "item cache" without the loading screen (e.g. using a waypoint or going to the character selection screen)
---
Knowing it and not using it starts to veer into the realm of stupidity no?
---
The option in "Combat/Movement: Disable Area of Effect rings" can also hide those and some other bosses attacks (VG blue teleports) completely.  
---
I tried to play with that checked once because I realized the effect clutter greatly reduced due to combo fields not showing, but eventually, I noticed it was also hiding some bosses attacks. It would be great if you guys could change that to hide only other players effects, but always show the PC and enemies effects. 
---
It won't solve the problem with visual clutter, but it would help certainly 
---
I swear if they make a greatsword elementalist I'm going to kill myself.
---
The only alternative I can think of is opening a bunch of [Wintersday Gifts](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Wintersday_Gift) and hope for some rare drops. It might get pretty expensive pretty quickly though.
---
That being said there's apparently also a pretty good build with berserker stats in [Vabbi Builds](http://builds.vabbi.org/). You could compare their playstyles and see if this one fits you better, or use it while you accumulate charged quartz crystals.
---
thanks for the info
---
The only content that you absolutely NEED ascended level gear (and in turn, legendary since it's equal stats), is in high tier fractals. Every where else you can get by with exotics, as long as you're built correctly 
---
If you're really concerned about time, I would definitely look into doing daily fractals. Even though they're done in a party, each fractal is reasonably short (only ~5-10 minutes each), so you could finish one and then leave if need be.
---
I'd ask your server commanders or just people on discord what they prefer using. Full celestial scourge is pretty uncommon nowadays.
---
There really needs to be a guild hall that's just a nice old-fashioned fortress. Giant golden palace ruins are too much for me.
---
Its called gw2 hook :)
---
Gammorah?
---
Cooking costs 1 gold per character.
---
Very clear.  I am swapping to staff and using 5 now.  I think I need to work up to being a proper alacrity renegade.  Guess it's one of those "learn to crawl before you walk" things.  Thank you for this rotation advice.  In previous games, I do much better with priority-based rotations rather than static rotations.
---
I mean the personal merchant is ok, but the thing I don't like about it.. is that you can't place it down if someone else has one near by, or if you have another NPC active, like the TP for example, and you have to stop to sell stuff at it.  With the ecto gamble gizmo you can just keep auto running while selling, and it's not affected by the number of summons NPCs nearby :)
---
When you use an autoclicker to open 1000's of bags.. yeah it will lag for anyone.
---
I'd suggest looking at [Vabbi's builds](http://builds.vabbi.org/) a point of comparison to metabattle (they should be mostly the same) but it offers some videos (and notes when they update). As for gearing it, celestial is offered in some core areas like fractals you can check [this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) for the general areas but it's going to be stuff like: All of the season 3/4 selectable trinkets[Lunaria](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lunaria,_Circle_of_the_Moon)/ [Solaria](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Solaria,_Circle_of_the_Sun) from fractals, [Celestial sigil](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Celestial_Sigil) / [Ancient Mursaat Token](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ancient_Mursaat_Token) from guild vendor, any of the 3 laurel amulets ([like eye of janthir](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Eye_of_Janthir_\(amulet\)), pretty much any [selectable stat back](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_back_item#Back_items_with_selectable_prefixes). As for armor you're honestly fine with exotic (it's ~2% difference in damage) so the options listed in the guide for stat selectable items (viper sections or berserker sections) should all have celestial like [this mask](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Confessor_Caudecus%27s_Mask_\(light\)) from head of the snake or [this one](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bloodstone_Crown_\(light\)) from out of shadows. You can also use [grand master marks](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grandmaster_Mark) to craft PvP, WvW, or fractal all stat armor. If you're going to craft the armor you can [craft a cheaper set](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/ascended?filter.type=0&amp;filter.subtype=Coat&amp;filter.weight_class=light) and [stat swap it](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing) to celestial (though this still needs the [exotic insignia](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Celestial_Intricate_Gossamer_Insignia) which means charged quartz so that doesn't really help you much. 
---
Hey whatever works!
---
More guild halls please.  
---
I loved this race in SG but they didn't give them alot of screentime. Now with drama pushed into SGU and ultimativly failing hard they probabbly never will.
---
Now now, no need to have Vor talk about his Janus key in here.  Some of us have places to be.
---
Core has a lot of power creep now.  Your proposal creates effectively two separate games, which is a lot more difficult to maintain and confuses players when they go from one to the other, each with different rules.
---
launch buddy is not a program for which you're gonna get banned, multiboxing however is only allowed as long as you follow [anet's recently updated rules](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/65546/policy-dual-or-multi-boxing).
---
As would I.  I would really like to go to the Charr Homelands again.  But I just see Claw island as such a wasted chunk of map.  They could add it to Bloodtide Coasts map, it already looks like it could be apart of it.  They share the same "rectangle" on the world map.  
---
Are you sure you checked your hero tab -&gt; miniatures and see if its there? It might be selected but its hidden (unchecked) so you cant see it 
---
Imagine when Caithe steals thr egg during the end of LW2.
---
Commander : My SHINYYYYYYY
---
The mixing of races doesn’t make them racially pure nazis. But I agree, it’d be too much of a boring topic shoved into our faces.
---
Quickness greatsword. The reset on your F1 is great and you have a lot of utility with your damage. It's also a [meta fractal build](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/hybrid-firebrand) that can also be [run in raids](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/power%20quickness/) with minor alterations and the correct team comp. If you get dragonhunter it's also easy to swap to that for more DPS.
---
And shinyyyyy
---
The good thing/bad thing about CM is that its a really small community. I already have a few people I know I should steer clear of when pugging. That said, there are a few that I join up and know its going to be a smooth run. It seems kind of weird in gw2, but take the time to look at people's names in your CM groups.
---
Also, run arcdps so that you dont yell at your necro for the lack of dps when the DD is pulling half the druid's.
---
Time to bring back Rytlock's blindfold. 
---
Judging by his attitude in his comments i really dont want this guy in our community...
---
[Rejoice comrades!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U06jlgpMtQs)
---
I crafted the precursor only to get the ooze tonic. I think it wouldn't be fair to have the legendary only to make my tonic a novelty. 
---
I mean I already did what's required to get the tonic. Being excluded from that QoL, only because I didn't do something additional feels wrong.
---
You get the instrument from mystic forge additional to the legendary, so you can get it without binding the legendary. 
---
That's what I did. I crafted the Minstrel only to get the instrument and sold it then. However, if you unlock the Minstrel skin by binding, you also unlock the instrument, so you won't miss it, if you buy the legendary. 
---
Did it less than a month ago and it was still viable. 
---
[removed]
---
same. cuz price is good &gt;&lt;
---
lol. rip 
---
Tomes of Knowledge (if thats what you're talking about) only level you from 1-80. And AFAIK leveling crafting doesn't give you mastery experience at all.
---
Silverwastes is usually the best way imo, that's how I got most of my tyrian masteries.
---
im good dude, not wasting my time on this dead game
---
Yes but you can reign in that power creep vs trying to do it on all the expacs. 
---
The only thing this would effect is competitive play not the rest of the game.
---
For the love of god, dont take legendary gear as the best armor in the game, it has the same stats as ascended, keep that in mind
---
2080Ti here and I average 30-60 in LA, I say 30-60 specifically because its always jumping around and it feels awful to be in a city.
---
Let me first start by saying I have not played Fractals since the new ones come out a long time ago. I have always had a problem with Instabilities they usual just make the content more annoying then difficult to me. After seeing [this last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdA3GHQsVbE) i have no interest in ever doing it.
---
Idk about you but I want in on that mesmer story.
---
Simple but not easy.  I don't think this is possible.  The well for forming statics seems to have dried up.
---
This is probably the best advice.  From now on if I don't form with 15 minutes of reset we'll call it.
---
Would anyone be interested in sometime in the future for the devs to add a test castle where wall defenders cannot be hit by attackers unless it's siege? Or maybe not being able to attack without line of sight of the player? Something on those lines.  Maybe test what it would be like with higher walls and adding a buff to players on the wall that increases skill range. I think it would be great to try new things and I am interested if people would even like this sort of idea.   
---
One of the perks of the Legendary is having the effect on at all times with the weapon out.  I think it's only fair to actually have the weapon made in order to get the permanent effect from it.
---
No, I got you. I appreciate that you tried to keep me in the know. Thanks mang.
---
Killing thinly-veiled pixel Soviets has been a rather calming activity in these last five years.
---
For power yeah, often times Mirage is Condi, and given OP is talking about Yassiths which is Condi, beserker isn’t a good choice. 
---
Yeah this is my fault.  I didn't push her to pick something from the approved list on discretize.  We might have to bin it.
---
Cursed Shore is always good.
---
Is druid still highly sought after?
---
They already have soo many maps that's unused or under used, I'd rather see those worked on before new ones. 
---
Including Claw
---
*taps forehead* Can't be blinded if you're already blind
---
How lucky for you that everything worked out in your favor instantly with no issues.  Must be nice.
---
Loving the style.
---
Very.. Tim Burton - Corpse Bride kinda stytle.
---
so ~10s profit per encryption
---
The purpose is to have accounts ready to access instead of typing in password and email over n over just to alt.
---
Your math is wrong, since you're assuming that taking Dune Cloak also prevents taking Mirrored Axes. Though you are correct in your overall conclusion, as I forgot that mirrored axes triggered off of clone ambush attacks for six, rather than three, torment stacks. 
---
I will be genuinely impressed if they do that and somehow make it work. 
---
This is a Floridaman headline, if I ever saw one.
---
Mlem
---
This is excellent feedback.  I never really looked at those skills very differently like I do utility skills.  I just look at sword/sword 1-5 as damage keys 1-5 lol.  The only distinction are that 3 and 5 ate gal closers.  I'm a trash player by all ranges of the definition.
---
Sylvari don't have last names, their parentage is obvious. The sole exception was Caera who started calling herself Scarlet Briar and killing a lot of people. 
---
What about classes that will never have access to hammer? Class locked cosmetics.. eh, I dunno.
---
&gt;Not really. If you and your gf are good at it, it takes 1 week or so of pugging before you find 3 more.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;*Translation: You not forming a  roster to make statics because everyone thinks you are terrible.*  
---
&gt;Source is me, i've done it multiple times for dungeons fractals etc.  
---
&gt;*Translation: I'm great. You're shit.*  
---
&gt;...  
---
&gt;However if you are not really good at it yourselves it can be problematic.  
---
&gt; *Translation: If you're having trouble it's because you're terrible.*  
---
I think it's a bit much to ask me to respond positively to that.  My response was not disproportionate.  
---
yyyyyyeeeeeees plzzzzzzzzz
---
The 4 torment from Imaginary Axes + Mirrored Axes on Player is redundant, as it's there on both situations.
---
You're looking at:
---
DuneCloakDamage (D) + PlayerImaginaryAxesDamage (Ip) vs CloneImaginaryAxesDamage (Ic) + PlayerImaginaryAxesDamage (Ip)  
---
D + Ip  vs Ic + Ip
---
Mirrored Axes (M) affects all instances of Imaginary Axes (Ix), so you're left with:
---
D + M * (Ip) vs M * (Ic + Ip)
---
Without Mirrored Axes, you have:  
---
D vs Ic
---
With Mirrored Axes, you have:
---
D vs M * (Ic)
---
So while you *do* have 3 Bleeds and 4 Torment on a dodge (with Mirrored Axes and Dune Cloak), you only need to look at the actual Dune Cloak damage when comparing it to Infinite Horizon.
---
Im actually of thinking of turning it into a "Guide to Tyria" magazine where it showcases basic aspects of gw2 in fun and easy way to read. But I really dont have that much time to do so. Maybe at least one page a week. But yeah my goal in the long run is to provide a guide hand book or something.
---
There was an mmo planed didn't even know. But yeah I mean MMOs at the moment are a pretty big no for most companys. I would be surprised if this made it even if SGU was a success.
---
idk why but im always hesitant to use drop shadows. I know they help the readability. But Im afraid it would make a bad contrast with a flat surface. I mostly do these for fun anyways, but i have a side job as a designer in my colleges magazine. So tips like these really help.
---
I multibox VB &amp; AB metas every day.  Using LB to load the clients up, and using [Sizer 4](http://www.brianapps.net/sizer4/) on a 1080p resolution with 4 different hotkeys set to the same resolution of 939 width x 527 height.  Each hotkey places the window in each of the 4 corners.  there is a bit of a gap between, but that's fine.  I wanted to keep the resolution somewhat normal looking.  This way I can auto attack on the boss and still see all screens actively.  No afking at all :)
---
&gt; 3*2 clone axes apply 6 stacks of torment for 7.16 seconds
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; 4 additonal axes apply 4 stacks of torment for 7.16 seconds
---
Where was the 4 additional axes from, if not the player?
---
I like this one http://gw2timer.com/
---
You already made the legendary, you would qualify in this case.
---
You don't need to actually be able to use the hammer.  I was thinking what if just have it so you need to complete All 3 collections, instead of just stopping at the Ooze like some people do.  You know like get the precursor at the very least?
---
&gt; Thanks for critiqe. Well, the portal is nowhere near Mesmer. It mimics your abilities
---
Oh, I don't mean Mist portal being similar to portal. I was comparing it to Phantasms and Mimic
---
True facts. This is the year they killed an entire subset of the PVP community. 
---
One reason is that imaginary axes and mirrowed axes can I hit twice, since you are melee and they search the target after you hit once already, giving them double value. 
---
I absolutely agree with the OP.  A clash of normal races would definitely be more interesting than the dragon apocalypse storyline we currently have.  
---
I think the main problem I have with the dragon apocalypse storyline is that the writers have largely been using the same template/structure for the longest time now.  Since HoT, every story update in dragon apocalypse storyline has largely felt the same.  It’s the same plot twists and plot devices being repeated over and over again.  It’s sort of gotten to the point where you can predict the plot twists and plot devices before they happen:  
---
1.	Taimi calls the Commander via mobile phone and introduces the plot. 
---
2.	Taimi says some techno babble (plot device).  
---
3.	Dramatic plot twist.  
---
4.	Commander does something heroic (plot device).  
---
5.	Chapter ends with another dramatic plot twist.  
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’ll always have fond memories of the Zaitan arc, especially the character Tybalt.  Now is the time to end the dragon apocalypse storyline and move onto something 100% new.  
---
I gave my necromancer female human a "gothic lolita" look with mostly Cabalist light armor skins, if that's what you mean. XD But she is wearing all black (debated between black and dark-green, but I just really don't like dark-green so just went with black and dark grey). She has black hair and ghostly pale skin, widest eyes with smallest pupils for the "crazy" look.  
---
She's actually my only character so far with a dark color scheme. My others mostly use a mix of white and pastel colors.
---
it hasnt
---
You need to do some research, it's not a disease
---
This could could end horribly or ok. There are no other options.
---
Both Warrior and Engineer are liked a lot (though if you're an engineer in fractals/raids, you'll likely be shoehorned into being a Holosmith, core and Scrapper are rarely wanted)
---
I'm not really sure if anything is thrown out that much, though I've seen a lot of groups not want Necros, or for some reason, Thieves o.o
---
Yes there are, plenty
---
Personally, I've only ever used ASUS gaming laptops (but the big bulky powerful ones, which really are great and don't lag for me), but I know they have different types of gaming laptops, including some more light-weight/smaller ones. I don't think GW2 is really that laggy of a game, to be honest... So I think a less powerful one should be fine?
---
are all clases viable? yes. content can be cleared with every class being able to and do a decent job at dps.
---
however. are all clases meta? no. and people will kick you from groups if they think you will be doing less dps because your class is not at the top of the dps benchmark list by 1k because "ermagerd only the top of the list is acceptable even though im doing less than half of that dps number even though im using it...but since the people that did the benchmark put it at the top that just means i must be doing top deeps"
---
just fyi you can check said benchmarks for dps at SC
---
https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/
---
and also check the builds/rotations there
---
I think you've downloaded the wrong thing. Did you get the Mac installer by accident? Did the file get corrupted?
---
Everything you've described suggests something unusual, so try to download the Windows installer again and start over. 
---
You might want to check your antivirus 
---
Buddy, you want to be on the other side of the pitchfork ;D
---
It certainly does, if you can do decent dps without relying to heals much you're going to skip lots of mechanics which is easier than doing them with horrible instabilities.
---
It's funny how this game differs from game mode to game mode. Scrapper is in high regard in WvW and have more or less become meta in a party composition.
---
I think you'd like [Guild Mag](https://www.guildmag.com). 
---
I've been doing some research and apparently there's this certain sigil that I can get the recipe through SM which would allow me to lvl my crafting in the same time that I make some cash. That's the only viable recipe for my current tier, any other one would cost me money, at least 20 silver per (crafting cost &gt; final sell price).
---
Considering I'm stupidly low on $$$ that's the only way I can lvl the next 25 tiers. This item is acc bound, can't be acquired though TP.
---
I got about 600 from a bleached bones, dwarven remnants etc etc run using Taco markers and floating about on my griffon for an hour and a bit. 
---
I just want the shrine guardian fox mount. :( I returned to find it was a limited-time thing that I missed out on.
---
I would love this. When I first played GW2, it was still the old Lion's Arch, but I was a total newbie and never got to fully explore it... then I returned years later to find it had a complete makeover. But it is still in the game's storyline quests, so I would think they could easily revive it as a lounge if they wanted to.
---
Pulling at X In 3 2 1... loot bags produced. 
---
I'd actually be for an underwater lounge, like maybe a Quaggan themed lounge lol. Mainly because it'd be something new.
---
No no no.
---
1 Marjory, 1 Kasmeer, and 3 Lord Faren!
---
&gt; or for some reason, Thieves o.o
---
Maybe for the same reason I don't always like having weavers in my PUG groups. It's really easy to punish bad plays for both professions, and dead dps is worse than low dps. 
---
Is there a discord for Crystal Desert?
---
Yes. T3 is the absolute worst, and you should get out as soon as you can.
---
If you have guildies or friends who can help you jump out of the cesspool that is T3, do it. There are only a few mechanics differences between T4 and T2, like a few more types of instabilities and slight changes to fights (nightmare and shattered bosses have some new mechanics), but you'll pick up on them.
---
Bullshit Noodle, and you know it, Reaper is still a weak dps class, and scourge even worse
---
Yes is does affect what tier of unidentified it drops,but when you open with a high magic find,the chances for exotics was much higher.
---
I've deleted the folder before and nothing happened, however I didn't run a repair after. I'll give that a shot tomorrow. Thank you for the help and link!
---
true it does not ALWAYS happen, however it is far more common than what you suggest. certainly in fractals you run into those kinds of people less than in pug raids though so keep that in mind. i'm sorry if i made it sound far more common than it actually is, but since it still does happen every now and then it is best to be mentally prepared for the scenario.
---
one reason it is probably way less common in fractals is because to kick someone there you need to have a majority vote to kick 1 person, while on pug raids if the commander is just a cunt he will kick you without a second thought according to his and only his judgement.
---
One of which is gender swapped!
---
I have been doing that and that has been the case once or twice. But there have been times that even just gw2 and discord have been running and it's still been terrible.
---
Only thing under "101 ways to dye" is that scrumptious sylvari navel.
---
Had a DE first time I did siren's, was absolutely awful on the ship. So yeah, I get what you're saying
---
&gt;Example: Gamble box costs 300 gems and gives 1 of 30 cosmetics (15 common, 10 rare, 5 unobtainable even more rarer).
---
You mean each box has a (small) chance to contain one of the 30 cosmetics? Fixed that for you.
---
First thing I did was removed arc completely. All the others I've tried as well to no avail. Thanks for making sure I wasn't struggling with such problems though!
---
And it’s not a Faren.
---
Honestly, playing a Ranger from 1-80 in open-world PVE I had no problems with using only the long bow. It was easier than other classes, at least for me since I really love having the pet as a tank while I snipe from behind.
---
But maybe you could try out Necromancer if you don't mind using axes instead of a bow? I find it even easier to survive and kill as a Necromancer than as a Ranger, both of which I have at 80 now. Necromancer with a minion build can have a whole army of pets who also heal you for a small amount with each attack.
---
If you're interested, this is the build I used to get started on my Necromancer (except I went Scourge at 80): http://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Reaper_-_Power_Minion_Master
---
I wasn't talking about gender. I was talking about defining sexual charcteristics.
---
Played upwards of 7 hours of HoT Metas / WvW yesterday and didn’t crash a single time, though I am running it without arcDPS for the time being (there are some visual quirks - for example at the Ley-Line Confluence waypoint in TD where the grass will seem pixelated at its edges). 
---
There are still some incompatibilities with some overlays (if you are using the Discord overlay, it might affect d912pxy‘s stability) but for me personally Rivatuner Statistics Server (/MSI Afterburner) has been fine since a week or two now. 
---
It also helps if ppl would cc actually the bosses and not take ages to break for example skorvald, even in 200-300+ kp groups 
---
This is amazing, I love everything about this picture
---
That highly depends on the game mode, but yes all classes are viable. Not that it would really matter in your case, because both Engineer and Warrior are viable in all game modes. Focusing soley on PVE, both Power and Condi Holosmith are good DPS specs for raids, depending on the boss you will want to switch in between these. Power Holosmith is also a very good DPS spec for T4 fractals and CMs. In dungeons it shouldn't matter much anymore, pretty much everything that deals decent Power-based DPS should be just fine. If you want to pick up Warrior again, you should not have any problem finding a spot in a raid or fractale group either, since Bannerslave is still meta.
---
I realized that a druid is way more meta than a soulbeast when I was almost done with my berserker gear. I'll have to start on my druid gear. Thought I've heard getting full harrier is a bit of a pain. I'm also low on gold and it'll take me a while to get mats/gold to get a playable druid. I do some basic druid healing in tough T2s, the joko one where you jump around and the pirate ship one. Its enough but I'm sure it wouldn't cut it in a T3 without proper gear. 
---
I guess I'll start from scratch and get a harrier set so I can support. 
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Primetime is around 3 to 7pm est
---
My mesmer and a clone of the former
---
Dude, you need to chill. GW2 isn't that type of MMO. GW2 it's the MMO for people who don't have time to play MMOs. Don't do stuff like this in a frantic rush. Take your time, everything you do on this game rewards you. 
---
they killed the last decent thing in the game that was roaming, the end game of this game is doomed ... Only mmorpg that does not have a mode of pvp 1v1
---
Fair enough.
---
I know others have already suggested that there may be other processes that start up and eat your frames such as windows defender, but this is always worth looking at again. I once had an issue with windows update where it got stuck trying to perform an update that it couldn't properly complete for some reason, causing frame drop and stutter. It didn't show up in task manager, so I couldn't see that it was eating system resources at all. It took quite a while for me to track down the issue and resolve it because of this, so don't assume task manager is giving you all the relevant information.
---
I've also had issues with the Google drive app trying to sync in the background, which normally resolves itself in a matter of minutes - except for the time a few months back when my drive space became full and the app kept trying to sync periodically even though it couldn't, and the issue would persist until the process was forced to close. Again, this caused problems without ever showing unusual system resource consumption in task manager.
---
Not sure if any of that will be helpful to you, but I hope you can solve your issue one way or another.
---
Yeah, I noticed with the Sylvari it was pretty diverse in character creation, like you could choose to use more "humanoid" faces, but you also had choices of very plant or tree looking faces too, and not only leaves for hair but also vines, flowers, wood, and other less conventional plant species. Also like the glow effect at night.
---
&gt; Also you should take a look on your build. Are you sure that zerk soulbeast is the best build you can have for Fotm? 
---
Mate, if you got nothing valuable to contribute, just dont comment. OP said he managed to get a full asc berserker gear set and you tell him that nonsense. Power soulbeast is a very good class for fractals, and just because you are unable to do fractals properly that doesn't mean every new player has to gimp his build to end up as bad as you.
---
&gt;  In T1 and T2 you can take any build and just bash your way to the end. 
---
Yeah, e.g. builds that aren't power soulbeast but some random useless combinations of stats/runes/weapons.
---
&gt; In T3 while you are learning, you finaly should have a healer in your  team. Ofcorse now some people will tell me that you dont need a healer,  that they dont have a healer most of the time and do just fine. But keep  on mind that he is a new player so its better to have a healer in your  group while you are learning. 
---
If you have a healer in your group there is exactly zero stuff you have to learn. You just facetank everything.
---
&gt; As a new player into T3-T4 you shouldnt be playing these glass cannon  classes. Everyone from T2 are coming into T3 with these zerk builds and  thats the main problem for them to go forward. 
---
I'm close to throwing up reading this level of bullshit. If everyone on T3 would be zerk build and able to play, T3 would be a breeze. So please for the love of god stop talking about content you don't understand. T3's main problem is people like you. Bullshit builds combined with "I know everything"-mentality thrown into a level that for the first time requires more than 3 braincells.
---
I think you'd be more likely to be kicked if you were playing Rifle Deadeye than power Soulbeast and that is probably a reasonably fair point for generic T4s where the lack of CC, cleave and mobility are an issue for Rifle Deadeye.
---
However, people do cling to misconceptions for fractal groups, particularly with the respect to burst DPS. Burst can be great in well organised groups but is less useful in pugs with Druids spamming GoE on the solar bloom phases of Arkk and not using it at all during the stun for example. 
---
This fortunately should be addressed soon-ish according to the recent communication because if you can force the dismount with your mount it would solve most of this issue right?
---
Crafting XP does not give mastery xp. That's why you should always level crafting before hitting 80
---
I haven't gotten to explore most of the 80+ maps yet other than Crystal Desert, but my favorite is still the lower half of Wayfarer Foothills (and the hot springs on the upper half).
---
However, a second tier damage dealer played well is still more useful than a mediocre meta damage dealer, at least so long as the damage type is correct for that encounter.
---
The only exception is Mirage on bosses where confusion can be exploited in which case the mediocre Mirage is probably still better. 
---
It's mostly just shit that's different. Gay has since then evolved from an insult to gay people to calling something weak or unmanly. While the connection is there, it usually lacks the intention.
---
Shit like 'autistic screeching' is the same. Connection without intention.
---
Don't believe me? Don't be such a girl!
---
It's closer to 100 than 50 but regardless its not trash talk it's just a fact, you like 90% of pvp players blame something else other than your own skill level as to why you don't get to the division u want. 
---
I do not see problem in killing people returning to Zerg, from the moment you play in group you are sacrificing your survival solo, it is a risk that you have taken and from the moment you have distanced yourself from Zerg you are subject to pay for that.
---
In relation to making roaming viable again is simple, just one attack and you fall from the mount, even because the mount is to be a tool of mobility and not of survival.
---
Only 3 clones?
---
Oh hey, it's /u/zoolk7's [weekly hate post](https://www.reddit.com/user/zoolk7/submitted/) about Warclaw.
---
Honestly, you could probably do Harriers Armor/Weapons with Water/Transference, &amp; Monk Runes using Zerker or Cleric's trinkets as a stand-in until you get more Harrier's.  Just make sure that you use rice balls and concentration food.  
---
Yep, without the helmet it becomes a really good armor for  heavy classes
---
That question should be directed at the person doing that comparison. Mine accounts for that.
---
Yeah. So far my experience in GW2 has been only plesant and friendly with open world, fractals, pvp, and dungeons... but I am scared about this "raids" thing I hear so much about people getting kicked. I'll probably just put up a "Newbie-friendly" thing on every LFG I do, but maybe that's why i have not yet run into any mean people. XD
---
the node you can get for your home instance (I think it's from the laurel vendor) has a rare chance to drop some, plus you can get the shards or whatever easily
---
  
---
Also I'd you get the wvw armour, it's stat selectable, so it can cut down a little on the time. you get exotic and then can work toward ascended once you get the exotic
---
Hum, but what about the bonus to condition duration that is applied to every condition ?
---
Damn that looks neato
---
'Moletariat' won me over :)
---
If I stopped people considering your "advice" I already did enough.
---
Note that [some material promotions are not profitable](http://gw2lunchbox.com/MaterialUpgrades.html).
---
It's very easy tbh:-P https://i.imgur.com/ZttVK4P.png
---
Then it's something returning/new players can set as a first goal. It's very achievable. No point in scaling the entire mechanic down only because players are scared of "barriers" and effort-reward system.
---
Sure. I’d prefer if everything reset at 00:00 server time, but the situation described by the top comment doesn’t really happen and we already have a one-hour grace period.
---
Oh man I forgot when that happened 
---
Such a fragile thing to live by

Problem with Minstrel in raid is that a lot of encounters follow the person with the highest person (tank). You would have to make sure that your tank always has more toughness than you. In fractals this is not the case.
---
In WvW, survival is key as healer and you just generally need the toughness.
---
Tell me Necro master, how is scourge very strong, and don't think about bringing heal scourge in here or i'll laugh at you.
---
It's just a convenience item to help you churn through lots of loot without having to worry about buying salvage kits. 
---
It's kind of a "if you want to support ArenaNet financially, this is a very convenient item to buy" than anything life-changing. 
---
I would love we bleed fire if one person could focus on it and carry the group, then another focused on boon ripping for no pain no gain, then the other 3 could dps/ give boons. Instead we have a huge spam fest of fireballs, even if I have alacrity I won't be able to keep up with the instability on a single target, forget about multiple adds. This is what I find unfun to deal with, one thing is no pain no gain where you used to have 1 disenchanter/ 1 spellbreaker focused on it and there wasn't a problem, or in cliffside where the hammer and the mobs spam crippling conditions so people started using multiple portals to avoid the excessive movement when doing the arm seals. These are 2 out of multiple examples of players adapting to well implemented mechanics. 
---
With the new randomized instabilities you have either, instabilities that don't matter and can be ignored completely, or a spam fest that if is ignored In some situations completely wipes you.
---
Now I don't mind playing druid in fractals where Chrono skips are too good to give up, or soulbeast with a friend running heal firebrand or heal renegade. Now when druid, the worst raw healer in the game can carry a half decent group through these "mechanics", you realize that in fact they aren't actual inspired mechanics, they are a damage spam fest, that doesn't even damage that much, and that can't be avoided by dodging because your endurance bar can only have 1 saved up since birds are a thing. 
---
If these players being annoyed aren't the biggest "gamers", tell me why haven't you taken over the fractal hardcore scene with your superior "gamer" abilities? People used to give free guides for the community and free speedclear strats that took a week of theorycrafting to be min maxed, now they are forced to look at the random instabilities and wonder if this combination is the most optimal, then instead of being able to grind the fights with different strategies for healthy amounts of time per day  they need to get the kills minmaxed until daily reset. The random aspect completely killed any minmaxing fractals could have had with the new instabilities, and if you think they were braindead because people ran 4 dps +Chrono comps and didn't die, clearly you don't do fractals with a competent healer, every single fight is braindead. They aren't annoyed because they can't complete the fractals as easily, they are annoyed because what made the game fun for them, and helped many more get into the scene, isn't there anymore, because you need to get lucky to have patch fractal records, experience and expertise no longer have a role when birds randomly blind cc skills mid cast, or we bleed fire has a 5 sec icd, per target.
---
Now go do your t4 dailies by kiting mobs for 3 hours, you clearly don't care about pushing times or figuring out new, faster and more challenging strategies. 
---
I see. Can harrier work im fractals tho? Or maybe a combination of two. 
---
All light armor classes ATM can use GS so I reckon they're just going to finish it off with ele, but I really am hoping for a longbow elementalist, give longbow some use maybe.
---
I'm throwing the portal scrolls of lws3 and 4 back to the bank. Haha. 
---
Besides the perma ones, i don't see much use of the rest since i only play fractals, sPvP and WvW. may raids at times with friends and on the weekends but that's it xd 
---
There are items i can live without, i wouldn't put them in the shared slot. 
---
I was thinking to put some foods and utilities I'd use often on multiple characters. Cuz that'd save 2-3 slots on each toon xD 
---
Why the downvotes, my longbow carrion ranger loved stacking on the house, now all of these elitist instabilities make me die because Anet doesn't want me having fun :((((((.
---
WvW isn't zerging only. There needs to be a compromise that accomodates roamers too. 
---
Any kind of buff like damage reduction or permanent stability that works if you are standing on the wall will be game breaking. From the outside, cool. But what if enemy gets inside? Some places like alpine bl towers, Bay, or area between inner and outer Hills would be absolutely not worth fighting in, with 10-15 semi-invulnerable defenders all round you.
---
There needs to be done something with the structure of the walls, like making them higher, wider. But that would require a major WvW restructuring so not gonna ever happen.
---
Thx mate :)
---
I don't use any alt so for me those are spots for my prestige items what I don't wanna mess up with sorting:-)
---
Killing people going back to the zerg is a valid thing to do and should be encouraged. There should be no expectation of safety while travelling in WvW.
---
If it was every 20 secs I'd be fine with it, try to solo we bleed fire with staff 5 on druid, it's literally impossible to get every single one, even if it's a lonely boss without adds. 
---
Well I wasn't even going to mention heal scourge, but honestly at the skill level where he is literally having to ask what is good, Heal Scourge is a pretty good choice.
---
But DPS Scourge has a nice flexible rotation, huge add cleave, decent CC, condi cleanse, and barrier which are all extremely useful at this skill level. Now before you break put the 25k Scourge vs 40k Mirage argument, again I am talking about at the average to below average skill level. Scourge is strong for average clear groups due to their massive utility, and based off the LFGs I see and my frequent pugging experience Scourge is not only accepted, but desired.
---
But given your tone and attitude towards the class and myself for whatever reason I'll end this here as I'm unsure if you can ever be convinced.
---
really bro.
---
you claimed you are so good and you chicken out like this 
---
well that's reddit 
---
&gt; before mount every casual who tried wvw was ganked before reaching the zerg or any location he was trying to reach.
---
&gt; before the mount every casual had no chance to escape rogue ganking roamers.
---
Compared to now where you can get ganked by roamers but with a mount if you don't have one? :p
---
&gt;first few hours are a pain. then it's much easier.
---
That's totally my point but I was more focusing on the first hours that can have a very negative impact on a totally new WvW player, because before you could at the very least wait for your zerg at a waypoint or wait for a few more people to go back on foot, now you can't even follow your own zerg on foot from a spawn without having to commit a lot of traits/skills.
---
&gt;oh btw u can unlock it all but a camp in eotm where mount is not usable so it's exactly like it was before and camp is easy to unlock in battleground.
---
You can but then, do you think EotM is really the best introduction to WvW a beginner could have? If you consider it only as "you need to do some stuff in EotM before you can get into WvW" it's still a pretty big step to be able to try out WvW if you compare this to almost any other game mode (bonus points because reward track gain is lower).
---
***
---
I'm not extremely pro or anti Warclaw tbh because I think it's too early to tell the actual effect on combat in the long run but it undeniably introduces a big 1st step that you have to climb just to be able to try out the game mode in decent conditions.
---
Also rip if you don't own (yet) PoF because then it means you are heavily at a permanent disadvantage while still theoretically being able to be useful/efficient in roaming/zerg (disadvantage that was not that big when gliding was introduced).
---
&gt; This is where they should have focused on from the very beginning: Fun
---
No, that's what ruined everything. They only ask "is it fun?", never "is it fun to play *against*?" or "is it in line with the rest of the game?". Oneshotting targets from 1.5k range and stealth is fun afterall, doesn't mean it's good for the game.
---
The copper-fed salvage kit is the one people like. It is technically cheaper per use than basic kits (3.5c vs 3c) but more importantly if you put it in a shared inventory slot it saves multiple basic salvage kit slots on all your characters. Normal loot you tend to get and go through quickly (green and blue items) so it's a big help dealing with inventory. That being said the upcoming change to make all loot into unidentified loot makes it a little less of a necessity.
---
*cue Mr. Krabs walk cycle noise*

https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/867159/#Comment_867159 
---
From Anet: 
---
&gt; When you get a loot drop if it is an exotic you'll get that exotic directly into your bag. If it is a lesser rarity then you'll get the unidentified gear of that rarity. On top of that if you identify the non-exotic gear there's ANOTHER chance for it to become an exotic. 
---
And later... 
---
&gt; Yes, magic find will continue to increase your chance of a direct exotic drop. 
---
Hope that clears thing up? That whole thread contains quite a lot of stuff as the devs answer questions. 
---
[http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/)
---
This is the Build I restored based on boons/buffs and conditions/debuffs appearing in the video (excluding runes and French seals).
---
&gt;u do not need to get ganked. just complete the whole unlock in eotm when mounts are not allowed. can be done. i did. problem solved
---
Then it means that the mount has introduced a very big step to people who just want to discover it that was not present before and is still not present in most of the other game modes. And now that we have a little vision on how we use the Warclaw on a general situation when most people have it (vs when only some had it) it really is a must have to be even able to follow your zerg and I think the introduction of this step is something worth talking about because of the impact it could have on new players.
---
What if you don't have PoF (yet) and you still wanna try WvW out? You have no way to get  the mount and thus to catch up on your zerg. In all the other game modes you can discover the game mode without PoF without having any real issue or disadvantage but now for WvW it's a requirement.
---
That's what I was trying to express not that "uh people will have to do a thing and it's bad, they should get things without doing anything". And now that we have a better idea of how we use the Warclaw I think it's an angle worth thinking about because it changes a lot what it means to "try" or "discover" WvW among other things.
---

Windowed fullscreen mate
---
The red border usually is easier for roamers because most servers don't really like to play on the desert border so zergs usually moves there when something need to saved but stay out if they can at any other point. It is ofc not written in stone that this is always the case but if you want a less populated area then red border is always the option. The spawn on red border for the enemy servers are really huge and if you can not get out on one side you can pick any of the others and with mounts and consider how big the areas are at spawn you should not have that much of a issue to get out and on to the map. 
---
Next episode is probably launched after SAB, so early may or so
---
&gt;  I don't know of any other living vessel capable of storing dragon magic
---
my theory based on nothing but speculation is that the gods will return and absorb the magic when kralk gets killed. but its just speculation, no idea whether its possible or not.
---
i dont believe we have a release date yet.
---
Basically, your best bet is ask a guildie that have t4 acess to join you in a group, and then merge you with a daily T4 lfg group, or post your group in the t4 lfg until others join, wich will keep it there even if your guildie leaves.
---
Bypass t3 entirely if you can, it's a toxic cesspool of bad. An endless nightmare if you are pugging it alone. :(
---
It's sad that we can't expect game devs to work on a piece of content without direct financial compensation. Forget the idea of just making their game better to try and bring more people in long term and keep them playing, nowadays it's pointless unless we are directly paying them for it the second it comes out. Like I get that you're right, it's just sad that things are the way they are.
---
Definitely the Kodan. Majestic as fuck, remind me of "His Dark Materials" Panserbjörne, Bearer of the flames, real tall like.  
---
I'll give the dredge credit for the copious amounts of both mole and communist puns though. Good effort.  
---
Oh and the exalted are pretty cool looking too.
---
You cant argue with these players. Anyone who suggests being unhitabble on walls is genuinely clueless with regards to wvw and should be ignored.
---
Image you cant be hit on walls. You can remove rams and golems from the game, those get cleaved down easily.
---
You cant use range trebs or catas. You can put gens on the walls and prevent wall dmg with 2-3 players indefinitely. Only way to break into a structure is no defenders.
---
Fun game. Most these suggestions are monkeys trying to share their roleplay with no grasp for counter play nor a clue about how wvw works.
---
Soon you will realize the true potential of a Scourge. Single target dps is not everything, otherwise everyone would be using rifle Deadeye.
---
The problem is not the magic within. The main problem is that, without them, nobody can absorb and regulate the magic of the world anymore. Even the gods cannot.
---
when I quoted the mode 1v1 did not mean in wvw, but a search mode of pvp, was doing a reflection on the end game of Guild Wars 2 and not saying that the mount destroyed the 1v1 cuz this never existed...
---
Nothing funnier than watching pugs talk about map movements.
---
If you cant cap sm, unless you are the strongest open field group by a good margin you cant go many places in eb. You're simply at the mercy of other groups.
---
Ok so you cant cap sm. Where do you go? Anza and durios are reasonable options. Mendons maybe. 
---
Most other towers and areas are usually not in your favor at all. Now sure you can sit in your towers all day waiting for enemies to come and feed you bags, but frankly most comms wont bother.
---
Everything else is suicide unless you can atleast beat the enemy close to their spawn. Making all objectives overly defensive has made it this way. Blame buffing defense for years.
---
You wont be able to do anything against stealth classes because for some reason even though they jump on me and aggro me and/or put condi on me, they go stealth and instantly loose aggro and can mount up whilst i am still in battle for reasons i don't understand because they are still close to me and i can not mount up but they can. How is that ok?
---
And it is not just people who are scared of fighting who i should not fight anyway that is doing this. Because i see every day people from both sides in which i know is totally capable to fight and stand their own ground but just skip it because it is easier for reasons valid to them at that very point. But this result in much less engages from all parts and there for makes roaming boring and stale. 
---
To Gulag he goes!
---
Use lfg and check on your favorite event timer when the map metas happen. Adventures also give lots of exp.
---
But what about the mount up issue? Were people on stealth classes can enter stealth and instantly get out of battle and mount up even though they are close to me who are still in battle becaues they engaged me and i can there for not mount up. 
---
Many of secondary races’ home during personal story quest. Like the Skritt base in Harathi Hinterlands or the Grawl base in Dredgehaunt cliffs. Neither can be accessed outside of that 1 story quest. 
---
Kormir’s library in PoF or the insides of the Moon Fortress, or the Inquest lab in Desert Highlands, or the Domain of the Lost, the insides of the Inquest lab in Sandswept Isles 
---
And many other examples
---
As you see Anet is perfectly fine with this controversial decision so it’s very unlikely they will change Claw Island
---
Didn't balthazar absorb glint's power when he he killed him?
---
How do you keep a point uncontested for 10 minutes? It took me 30 min+ killing the lord 3-5 times to flip a garri because you can suicide contest indefinitely with the new mount. You literally cant flip no matter how dominant as long as they have players and are willing to throw bags your way.
---
How do you think you can keep any point uncontested for 10 minutes? 
---
Oh right wait until everyone sleeps then cap it. Then have a stalemate for 5 hours whenever people actually play. Great design much fun. 
---
Please explain how you ever see this work.
---
If there's one thing Anet should nerf it's boon spam from fb and scrapper because of nerfs to boon counters on spb/scourge was nerfed for no reason. Scourge isnt even the main offender in current meta.
---
My bad. When I said "we could test a few bits" I meant me and the seller 😂
---
Out of interest. Are you selling those raxmcibg medalians?
---
Hoping to have the time to join this weekend! 
---
Harrier's gives more boon duration and healing than minstrel's. If you can afford to be more squishy, you should go for it. Basically go for harrier's in PvE, and minstrel's in WvW.
---
Yeah but just custom arenas are not enough, every decent mmorpg has a 1v1 pvp mode, duels are my favorite thing in the game and i cant do it cuz most part of the day the arenas are empty or full of ppl just testing builds etc. What is the difficulty in creating a 1v1 game mode? unfortunately, this game is made for casual players, players who cry if they can not return to zerg, players who could not even imagine an open pvp game and thanks to this, pvp is increasingly ignored in the game, becoming more and more so that "everyone can participate" even without any effort to do so.
---
1. Still very strong and with mega servers I'm never in a "dead" map.
---
2. I wouldn't exactly call them dead but dungeons aren't supported content, focus has been put towards Fractals which are similar. Can still find dungeon groups but people tend to do other content instead.
---
3. PvP is still a thing though I do more WvW than sPvP. As always with PvP there are going to be salty people and I guess it isn't quite as active as it may have been in the past but I'm really no expert on sPvP populations.
---
4. Depends on what you want to do, there are a lot of great options. Maybe check out [dT](https://discretize.eu/builds) for the meta fractal builds (they are a little behind on updating), or [snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) for raids, [Vabbi](http://builds.vabbi.org) has WvW zerg builds, and [metabattle](http://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki) has the rest.
---
Ah, I see what you’re saying. Role-players are like your comment. Both are plebeian and neither has anything to contribute. You should probably just come out and say that though. 
---
&gt;everyone needs a gripphon
---
Except it's not true?
---
For what would everyone "need" a griffon? It sure is nice and fluffy and all but it is a very optional mount. Sure you can't do Griphon adventure without it but that's kinda like saying there were adventure made for the Jackal and you can't do them without it because you need to go through sand portals.
---
I don't have it on my alt account and I honestly do not see where I actually need it: the worst time I have is when trying to go on the Eater of Souls platform in W5 because it takes me an extra 10-15 seconds to get there.
---
&gt;if u don't have pof yet buy it. that's it
---
Except that's not "it", you can't just go to someone who want to try out WvW "just pay X $/€/whatev and that's it" while you can go discover meta events, PvP, Fractals and Raids without PoF. You just underlined my issue with this step, before it was "just go in and discover" now it's "get PoF, do the collection that takes a bit of time and then you can discover borderlands".
---
&gt;and btw i do wvw and do not listen any commander. just roam on myself or join the zerg. not everyone plays wvw the same
---
When I join a zerg I tend to go listen to the tag because it helps a lot to know what we are supposed to do (unless it's a tag I know very well and I'm feeling lazy). When I roam around of course there is no need to go join a voice com with a tag, but unless you are a PvPer I think you will start WvW by joining a zerg (at least that is the experience of many people I know even if after some went more to roaming, havoc or guild raids) and joining a voice com to listen is a good habit to take imo.
---

Wvw heal scrapper guide:  https://youtu.be/FGjqMpBME5c
---
&gt; they go stealth and instantly loose aggro and can mount up whilst i am still in battle for reasons i don't understand because they are still close to me and i can not mount up but they can. How is that ok?
---
I have literally never seen this happening. If someone attacks you then and applies condis to you then either the condis need to run out or you need to be quite far away from them so that they break out of combat. They can't just cast stealth and then break combat. So either you are fighting against multiple enemies, they are that good to play with those things to their advantage or they found a way to circumvent the most basic and core principle of the game.
---
Also, there is no aggro management in the game.
---
&gt; But this result in much less engages from all parts and there for makes roaming boring and stale.
---
And it was better before? Before mounts you ran around through the maps for 10s of minutes and then someone just pounded you into the ground without you even being able to react and then you had to walk all the way there again.
---
I don't know what is happening to you but IMO it brought some very good change of playstyle to WvW. And you can still roam around you just have to be more careful. Capturing camps is not a sure thing anymore because players are more likely to get to that position quickly.
---
I miss the Scarlett days.
---
Jahai Bluffs, ??? zone.
---
Ohh yeah when we got drugged lmao
---
Yes, that's what Kormir was talking about, and what Anet has been working on in the background but was forced to quit that. Now Anet will need to come up with a major shift in the story and turn back to releasing expansions for Gw2 instead of a new game taking place in the new world created by the Gods.
---
I question why wall defense should be further buffed. Why do players think they should have a position where they can kill others without counterplay?
---
The only moment wall defense struggles is when all defenders are on the wall and when the wall or gate isn't down.
---
If the wall or gate is down, being on the wall as range gives you an advantage.
---
If you have a defending force off the wall then attackers are forced to spread CDs between wall and ground defenders. Suddenly the wall becomes a huge advantage because it's a safe position with 1 dodge.
---
Once attackers go into the lordsroom defenders have further defense advantages in terms of mobility and space, as well as reinforcements. Plus possible tactics, siege, the lord and requiring uncontested circle.
---
So the walls are an advantage as long as you arent MUCH weaker than your attackers. The issue is the sheer amount of players expecting to be able to fight others without being in any danger themselves. That's just expecting anet to fix their trash gameplay without understanding the consequences on the gamemode. 
---
If you remove counterplay people wont just suicide and feed bad players bags all of a sudden. They will stall and avoid suiciding until they can deal with the walls appropriately without it being suicide. This typically means waiting until you vastly outnumber or out skill your opponents.
---
The objective itself is then no longer a thing you fight for or around, but a reward you take once you dont have any enemies willing to play the gamemode left. This is unhealthy for the gamemode.
---
This thread is full of players whose grasp on wvw doesn't deserve a response. The fact that people seriously suggest being invulnerable on walls without realising that makes walls entirely unbreachable is a perfect example. Sitting on walls expecting free fire is RP for plebs that dont want healthy gameplay or counterplay. 
---
Have you tried going around killing ambient creatures with boosters on? That’s something solo you can do 
---
Do you realize you want to 1v1 everyone, even those who are not ready for it? Now you can only fight those who stand a chance and actually want to.
---
The best tip i can give you is to start your own LFG, Be sure to ask for at least an Healer and a Warrior this will help greatly.
---
Don't be afraid of wipes its part of the fun at the beginning, the more you wipe the more you learn at the start so never give up!
---
That's all just pure speculation.
---
I didn't ask about Dragonhunter but ok.
---
yeah it was vlast i meant, got them mixed up.
---
i guess im remembering wrong then
---
What a wonderful idea! Desperately seeking this on EU servers :). My chrono is ready...
---
Roaming, scouting and tail-gainking are one of those things that weren't part of the original design and players came up with, like Speedclears and [Running](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Running) in GW.  
---
The basic idea of WvW was having parties and squads fighting for objectives. 
---
That doesn't mean ANet should prohibit, support or ignore anything players come up with, it only means players feeling entitled to have it supported is counter-productive, as it won't do any favors to garnering support for it.  
---
Anet may or may not support a player-made behavior. Whatever they decide to do with it will be their decision. We can only give feedback about it.  
---
For example, people used to farm CoF1 repeatedly, and that was not supported, so it got changed several times to discourage doing one path over and over, then to discoruage doing the same few paths every day, while giving more rewards to doing several different paths over time.  
---
Lots of people really liked the CoF! farm, and came up with excuses like "It's about skill and competing with each other about who does it faster", but at the end of the day everyone knew it was about amassing lots of wealth in little time, and it was bad for the game on the long run, so it was rightfully scrapped.  Some claimed they'd leave because of the changes, but most of them came back eventually.  
---
People have to accept that what individual players enjoy isn't always the base for the game no matter how convinced they are about it.  
---
There's a big picture.
---
For Largos they absolutely should as Mirages so I'd suggest that maybe those Mirages are a touch below mediocre. Matthias is a different matter since it isn't so heavy on the confusion preference and is one of the few bosses where condi thief is still reasonable. 
---
Ah Okay. so basically what needs to happen is to feed kralk so much magic he goes to sleep?
---
If u arent ready dont enter wvw... this is the problem of this game, people want the content to be available to anyone even without skill, training or preparation ...
---
That's because the damage from confusion is not shown in arc and can be up to 10k extra
---
This would be fixed with a way for players to catch up with mounts, like:
---
 
---
* An effect that gives a similar speed while out of combat.
---
* A new blueprint to build a cart that can be attached to warclaws and can carry 4 players. 
---
* A mount rental at home bases for a mount with no skills, only the speed. Something like 100 badges of honor for 1 hour.
---
Oh, I was just really curious - and am really curious of how people fill their bags. When I played wow, I had like 6 tabs of guild bank full of stuff and I would never have any room in bags because...uh. it didn't have material bank or wardrobe back then.
---
Now I have same issues but smaller. Thank Grenth for deposit materials and wardrobe.
---
If you have 9 alts then most of those make sense. 
---
Only way I hassled with gathering tools was Mithril and Ori tools only lately. Orich ore is so rare outside pof. Now I bought 3 slots for swapping around on all alts.
---
And yeah I think most of my comments come out as insulting. I tend to ramble a lot too. 
---
There are spots on desert bl where you can build high up gens to prevent long range.
---
In the past you could gen your gens to prevent counterplay all together.
---
I agree 5 v 40 isn't a thing, but you can stall for very long times 5v40. You can hold most objectives despite being significantly outnumbered or out skilled often indefinitely or at least for hours.
---
This isn't healthy for the game and produces stalemates with no gameplay constantly.
---
Making new player play 8 hours of eotm is probably the best way to make them never play wvw ever
---
Its your best bet on survival tho. consider it.
---
Cus fighting a dueling build on a double well necro or hammer rev is very fair lol.
---
Those people have literally no chances against a roamer and there's no "skill" on the roamers side on winning that 1v1 either.
---
This is hypocrite. You state how organised attackers should be while also outnumbering yet dismiss counterplay by defenders in saying that they are never organised.
---
If defenders are significantly worse than attackers, and both are imperfect, should attackers not have reasonable ways of attacking objectives?
---
NSFW
---
Damage from confusion is only not shown if it's triggered by the boss using an instant cast skill (your game doesn't know it triggered confusion). That is mainly the case on Soulless Horror (~half of confusion damage, indeed up to 10k) and Mursaat Overseer (all confusion damage).
---
For the bosses they listed, arcdps area damage will be rather accurate.
---
Guardian ist pretty good and has lots of ways / utilities to make your daily fractals way more comfortable, like reflects or stability etc :) 
---
Next episode krak goes to therapy, he understand he is doing bad stuff and its going to be friend with the commander, after a huge brief of learn to forgive and forget.  
---
My commander is a charr female. Anything wrong with that line? 
---
Do you want to revisit historic locations on Guild Wars 2. Look no further for price of 500 gems, you can treat yourself to explore all locations otherwise locked behind the storyline. 
---
CLICK HERE to learn how. 
---
I mistook the commander's jaw in the fourth panel for a fifth arm for way too long...
---
A lot of pent up anger about a game, you should seek help
---
i thought about that but.... that only works for non-crunchy snacks (vegetables not included) and the spears have tips so wide it just ruins the snack, yet more reason for centaurs to be enraged and frustrated.
---
While we may never be able to outright kill Kralkatorrik, we could try to trap him. He showed us that open world fractals are possible in Jahai, so creating one around him to force his being to repeat ad infinitum (meta event) would in essence isolate his magics.
---
Absolutely, but those won't be mediocre Mirages and instead players that absolutely fit the advice that you are better with a less meta profession if you can play it better. Mirage tends to be an outlier though as it is very easy to reach respectable DPS on encounters like LT without having a firm grasp on how to play the profession.
---
However, the tendency of pug groups to look almost exclusively for Mirage DPS for LT does mean that you will have a higher proportion of truly poor players turning up with such because that is the requirement for the group. 
---
Someone is as salty as the ocean.
---
its true, i was the tournament...
---
I did a cursory search both on here as well as on the wiki and could never nail down an answer, so I'll ask, risk of looking like a stupid newbie be damned. :P
---
LFG groups for the story dungeons - those don't automatically take me to the dungeon, right? I gotta get out there on my own? I haven't joined any parties that were looking for more for Ascalonian Catacombs yet specifically because I was concerned about "hey, get over here" "wait where is here, aaaaaaaa" and basically being a drag on a group, so I figured I'd ask.
---
What? They dont do better though. If they do better thats just other players not doing a rotation. The only case you can make for reaper doing better is it having an easier rotation so in newer parties you can focus on other stuff
---
"Summons", "invocations" aren't game terms and could have a few different meanings in gw2
---
what are you specifically envisioning?
---
In general PvE you can literally play anything. In Raids it is a bit of a different story. In the [current meta](https://snowcrows.com/)
---
Ele uses some summons like Fire Greatsword, Lightning Hammer.
---
Necromancer has Flesh Golem, Shadow and Blood Fiend.
---
But others summons are not really used.
---
Class that summon things
---
I appreciate the wall of text - and I have one in return. This was more the sort of response I was looking for. You see, I recently had some friends come to the game from ESO PvP. Before that they were active in WoW and DAOC. They’re primarily PvP players (and proficient ones at that), but they were put off by the lack of mounts in WvW. They decided to join me in GW2 when the warclaw was introduced. 
---
After a few hours of WvW they had a number of complaints about defending objectives - specifically they had complaints about defending from walls. I wasn’t sure what to tell them about that. From my perspective, you just play the game as it is. If arrow carts are a problem, learn to take out arrow carts. If the walls are covered in red circles, learn to dodge. The game is the game. The meta is the meta. They seemed to be coming to WvW with expectations that had no bearing on the reality of WvW. How do you respond to something like that?
---
Again, to be clear, I am not talking about PvE players. We all three of us used to Realm vs. Realm in DAOC and in WoW we played on Kil’Jaeden (a PvP server, Bloodlust battlegroup) in world, battleground, and arena PvP. We worked well together. I don’t care for ESO gameplay though. It feels too slow for me. I opted for GW2.
---
So when I saw op’s post here, I began to wonder if maybe my friends’ concerns were more common than I realized. Playing devil’s advocate in this thread, however, earned me a lot of low effort “get gud” responses. They can’t seem to make a distinction between a conversation about the player’s experience of WvW and a conversation about balance in WvW. And if they think you’re talking about balance, get ready for some tantrums. How are people threatened by conversation? You’d think half the thread was going through menopause. 
---
Anyway, I think you’re right. At first I thought it was a ”realism” issue for them, but now I think the problem might be that ESO and GW2 sit at the opposite ends of your proposed “epic vs. engaging” spectrum. I myself can’t stomach a slow, drawn-out game. I think maybe their expectations of WvW were shaped by their time in ESO. WvW is just tuned for a different sort of experience. But I still think it’s important to understand and discuss the difference. 
---
Anyway, thanks again for the perspective. Now I have a new point of reference. 
---
again, that doesn't really mean anything in gw2.
---
Yes if you also consider mesmer/renegade a summoner-like classes, but no if you obly consider necromancer as the obly and pure summoner class available (pop your summons and run for hours without having to resummon unless you change map or they get killed).
---
Only good for cleaning maps, but hell, you can do that even with full healing scrapper. 
---
Necromancer's minions basically handle everything for you in Open World PvE, but aren't used in a Raid setting afaik.
---
I'd skip T3 entirely to be honest. Even if you dont play optimal on T4, a good group can carry you a bit until you catch up. You should be able to do the mechanics when required, though.
---
Also, if you infuse/attune your rings, make sure to extract the infusions before. They'd be lost otherwise during the upgrade process, iirc. 
---
Yes, you need to be on the same map of the dungeon.
---
Unfortunately, a dedicated summoner class doesn't exist yet. It could in the future with elite specialisations. The closest existing class to a summoner is mesmer, and all of the mesmer builds rely on clones/phantasms. It could be what you're looking for.
---
Necromancer has summoned pets and guardian has summoned weapons and engineer has turrets. However, those niche builds are not feasible.
---
Actually, the [optimal reaper build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/reaper/power/) for raiding takes *three* summons.  
---
Okay, cool, thank you for confirming. :)
---
You should only need a head piece since you can move the amulet and backpack from necro by using the shared slots/bank
---
I think I saw that lfg. I laughed a little when I saw the setup xd
---
Summons like minions, are a pet for Necromancers.
---
They do not scale well at all, hence people use them less in endgame settings.
---
They are fine for most content though. 
---
ahhh gotcha =D
---
I run a theme build revolving around a dragonhunter who summons spirit weapons.
---
I also have a necromancer who summons loads (read 7) of minions.
---
are you really suggesting that seeing the ugly base models 24/7 os a fix? lol
---
Oh, I still haven't tried raids and guessed that Scourge would be *the* way to go. Nice that there are some alternatives for beginners.
---
I've seen enough of that godforsaken place to last a lifetime. If you want an argument against replaying the story, CI fits the bill. :P
---
I mean they don't want you constantly staring at the UI, If you wanted that you could play WoW.
---
"I don't know."
---
Mans not hot 
---
[Power Chrono](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/) I guess...
---
Hey there my dude/dudess .  So while I generally agree with don’t skip content ( and I did the grind through the t3s) t3 is a pretty horrible atmosphere . I remember I was stuck really bc I didn’t have the gear so needed to grind a bit to gear up . You though can slap another a lot on the rings and get a tear and be in the t4s. I would highly recommend it as the lfg is much more active and I feel generally a less toxic community as long. Hit me up with a pm and when I get home I’ll get you my username ( I think it’s Novic.2816) and add me . I’m in a guild (fotm) that is dedicated to only fractals and usually has people looking to get a group going on !

I dont understand why it flashes in all kinds of terrible colors, gives me a headache

---
Waw, that's actually quite an impressive train of thought, nice!
---
Silverwastes
---
True, but then one would also assume that fortifications would be designed with such skills in mind. In real life distance, elevation and crenellations help. In Tyria/the Mists you need a bit more when people can conjure balls of flame hurting down from the sky.
---
Yup
---
Second. Especially if you come back after a long time (like me) the amount of existing content (2 expansions, 4 living worlds, raids, new fractals, legendary armor, etc.) is not at all trivial
---
the ability to use the not derpy looking two legs run is all I want for my many charr
---
I'm comfortable multi-classing in T4 so I don't care what people brings, as long as they contribute and don't die. But man, *three* 2k dps at the same time?
---
Ironically one of the warrior kept bragging that he has big dick dps ಠ_ಠ
---
Maybe it's just be be I barely saw any decent combos on the DH clips, escpecially the fight vs that warrior would have been over in 30 seconds if you just landed everything perfecly instead of spamming cd's. 
---
I don't mean to be rude just some critical feedback. The editting done is super sweet!
---
I don't play WvW at all.. but these ideas just sound like they are coming from someone with less experience in it than I have. It sounds like you get annoyed that you cannot defend from a wall without being bombed with AoE, and that you struggle to survive it all because of overzealous positioning issues on your end, but don't let your own mistakes and annoyances drive you to suggest a change that just outright sounds like it would ruin a lot of the attack/defend 'balance' that's already in place. Defenders already have a big advantage over attackers, utilize siege and communications if you're struggling to defend already.    
---
any WvW focused player can rip into my comment if I am clueless though, i'd rather be educated than think this is just how it normally is in WvW since my experience is minimal
---
&gt; There are spots on desert bl where you can build high up gens to prevent long range.
---
Against one specific wall/gate, yes. That doesn't stop the 60 from taking that objective, it just stops them from using that particular wall/gate to get in.
---
what is your sample size? did you just have like 1-2 bad runs and decided to say "every group"?
---
They are the new advanced models. I wanted a new card so went with them.  Picked mine up in mercury white from best buy 
---
I realize that everything I say is anecdotal evidence but since February things have been on a downward spiral, in my opinion.  It's become so risk to pug CM's that most days we don't even try anymore.  
---
Very true.
---
Dude... are you seriously quoting GW2 rules of conduct? YOU of all people?
---
You've been breaking them DAILY by not only harassing me, but almost everyone else who doesn't play a meta build. Hypocrisy at its finest.
---
Surprised you're not banned yet.
---
With love, Helen.
---
Higher levels give more relics. Dailies should also give some extra relics.
---
This is adorable!
---
If you need help with chrono and are in the EU servers, hit me up, I'm able to help.
---
Please note that "auto attack", while in the game, is not in the game to AFK farm or similar. That still goes against the rules.
---
We want players to actively play. The word of focus being "actively". If you can do that with more than one account, please feel free. However, if you cannot, and you use macros, shortcuts, auto-attacks or 'parking' characters to gain benefits, you may get actioned.

---
Would you say that if you didn't have PoF yet for some reason you would still have had an good experience if you went to play for let's say a week without the mount at all (ie. you wanna try WvW a bit but you only have HoT so getting the mount is not even an option) or was it ok because it didn't last that long?
---
Which is why I'd like to see a "modified meta" of builds designed with the overall intent of "success at any cost" as opposed to "fast clear or wipe". 
---
Builds intended for pugs, casuals, and average players, where the overall goal is to maximize chances of success through the scenarios most average groups are likely to encounter.
---
So, things like taking for granted perma quickness and alacrity, etc. or killing before having to deal with various mechanics, etc. wouldn't factor into the build.
---
They would certainly have more modest dps numbers overall, but even that would be a good thing, since it'd give people more reasonable/realistic targets and expectations.
---
I mean, if tarir were made of wood...
---
It was okay for me because it took me, who already owned PoF, only a day to unlock the mount. If you're an big time WvW player you are pressured into buying both PoF and HoT which is somewhat problematic but at the same time it monetizes this game mode, hopefully making it more important for Arenanet to add development capacities to WvW. 
---
&gt; Phylacteries
---
I choose to interpret this as meaning we need to farm istan to bring Aurene back.
---
Game is good. Starter maps are actives, dailys are very active. There are trains in HoT and now Season 4 maps. HoT metas done regularly on weekends.
---
PvP has regular seasons. Average queue time is 2 min. Fights are still very one sided but just due to lack of player pool. 
---
WvW still the same. Got player interjection due to new mount.
---
Content-wise and moral we are in bit of a drought. Anet as a company went through a firing purge assures that they still have Season 5 on schedule. Assures that nothing will hinder GW2 playing in the future. Naturally player base is apprehensive. Content may slow as they readjust but who knows.
---
I've tried healegade a few times but the tablet micro struggle is real.  Not everyone clusters up to make healing easier.  
---
Is it viable to throw the harriers on the firebrand instead?  Run something like:  [http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQNApeGWeIs95Z+MgiFAaAfgs3z8JDA-jxhXQBNUJYoeCA0Tfg/U/RXnCAAs/ACV+FA4A49u393D8+7v/+7v31v/+7v/+7v/+7vXKA/mZB-e](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQNApeGWeIs95Z+MgiFAaAfgs3z8JDA-jxhXQBNUJYoeCA0Tfg/U/RXnCAAs/ACV+FA4A49u393D8+7v/+7v31v/+7v/+7v/+7vXKA/mZB-e)
---
I've been working something similar too. Look at the Desert King &amp; Shifting Sand weapon sets. Desert King aren't *that* expensive in the TP (relatively speaking ofc) But Shifting Sands ones are really pricey right now.
---
Ah, okay, that's handy! That's a good deal more convenient; maybe I'll knock that out today after work. :)
---
I've never played RuneScape, so I'm sure these places look very different than their Tyrian counterparts in game, but at least the maps look eerily similar to me.
---
Meteor hits more times and they strike a lot harder. Unless fire overload hits 10 targets now.
---
True. However, it highly depends on your group composition whether you actually need that much as a Support Scrapper. 
---
Which bags are to be opened with bag opening toon ? Rare gear bags i guess is for 80 characters for ecto. Noxious pods and all others for toon? Unid gear is for 80 aswell since its only level 80 gear from them too.
---
Downvote and move on.
---
It's not strange, it's a cinematic shown during the Daybreak story.
---
One thing you could try if others are going down is swapping to blood on reaper, for the fast res.
---
If a group is struggling I always go scourge. I keep my viper gear but swap to blood and condi cleanse  traits. The range offered on sceptre allows more mobility and the shades offer great cleanse. F4 is a great downed relocAtor and fast res. It's situational, and depends on scourge having good awareness of teammates status. I also should mention that barrier application can help pre empt some spikes. So lots and lots of benefits and still reasonable sustain dps. Point is you either have a smooth clear burst group with healer, or a struggling group. Lower total dps with more survival wins every day.
---
Of course, I definitely don't mean to imply that either game copied the other -- it is clear that they ended up with very similar layouts though!
---
Very good point, although the geographic layout of Middle Earth doesn't look nearly as similar to Tyria as the RuneScape world does.
---
This is shockingly accurate. RuneScape was my first MMO, and I've been wondering why I felt naturally connected to Tyria... Maybe this is why? Hah
---
When I saw it on my feed thought for a second that is a trailer for new LS
---
Meta events are chained together. For example Verdant Brink after matriarch move to tangled depths for chak then move to auric basin for tarir meta then move to dragon stand for the snake. It keeps going on like that and after 1 run you should get enough exp to level your mastery
---
Just wondering why now? Is it just for promotion?
---
Its for the new players and returning players event going on for 5 weeks. Rubi said on the forums we should get a schedule for this today so lets wait for that. This is during episode 1 when we are on the way to find one of our Allies.
---
Can confirm, I have an EU friend in my guild that donates raid decos. Also, I can place a decoration in our guild hall, and they will see it appearing when they go in(but we cannot be in the same instance of Guild Hall).
---
A friend and I have been doing fractals for a while and we always pair at least one support with another support or dps, e.g. FB + Ren, Druid + DPS, soon Chrono + DPS/Druid. 
---
Specifically a well played FB/Ren combo carries very hard in fractals but with, say, a support like Chrono or Druid and one decently played dps that does a good amount of cc and has good cleave, you can get very far, too.
---
From my observation, you want to cover essential boons, some off-healing, cc and essential mechanics as much as possible yourself because pugs are hit and miss. Big DPS is nice but your goal when pugging should be to reduce volatility.
---
Finally, 40 essences is not a lot and you should expect some bumps along the road, when pugging I usually look for groups with around 150 KP, those groups are usually quite steady and mediocre.
---
For the team chat, it's always the same people doing it and every server has them. We get them from relinks and the best way to handle is just to report/block.
---
Brilliant. Ty
---
I loved eotm myself, there was a super nice commander running around and I got probably half of my warclaw reward track progress there in one day.
---
The "real" WvW involved a lot more dying and running around trying to keep up with players who had the mount already.
---
I would recommend Reaper from HoT. You get a second health bar and deals really good physical damage.
---
not gona lie.. day 1 playing this game, this was what i heard and i fell backwards off my chair laughing
---
Personally I think that'd be a massive waste of the potential for Claw Island.
---
I got baited so hard, thinking it was the ep6 trailer, but alas tis not. 
---
Man the nostalgia is kicking me hard right now.
---
Aurene's vision from Daybreak.
---
Can someone explain the Raid Condi Mirage "rotation" for me? It's hard to understand what the snowcrows rotations section is explaining. I understand the opener and the shatter-clone-regen rotation but how do I know when to shatter, and how to fill the gaps?
---
This. It's always about fighting some already existing character. Friends with frog here. Enemy with frog there. Friend with charr there. Enemy with charr there. Sylvari evils here. Sylvari buddies there. It's always fighting some already existing character turned evil.

---
Yeah I agree with Reaper, fits all those criteria nicely.
---
dated May 25, had to go back and check if this was recently posted or not.
---
Thanks !
---
I'll give a try to the greatsword mesmer :)
---
If you count Ele summons might as well count banners too.
---
Without putting down all the numbers I'd say you could get a good number (not sure if lower or higher though) with Warrior on Axe/Axe if you allow them to use Banner of Discipline.
---
Would you take into account crit damage modifiers that only proc in some conditions (like Duel Grandmaster on Mesmer) or strictly the number displayed on the hero pannel?
---
Yeah that's a pretty good point. "Real" WvW was a bit rough but totally doable without the mount for a few hours but indeed, if I didn't have PoF I'd probably feel bad. Maybe they could just do mount rental (however with just enough limitations that it wouldn't make people ignore the actual mount acquisition)
---
Honestly a lot of these are spot on, while some like Orr arent.
---
Tarir being the elf city is oddly fitting too hah.
---
I wonder how the modern RS map fits in to this though. https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/runescape2/images/1/10/RuneScape_Worldmap.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/3168?cb=20180903165502
---
This *is* strikingly similar. That's really weird.
---
I heard Support sometimes offer cost difference refunds for things like this.
---
Bought Daybreak a week ago. Welp, RIP 200 gems.
---
Yeah, I sent them a ticket since I'd seen that mentioned around here as well. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, yeah?
---
I won't even be mad if they say no, I'm enjoying the hell out of the game so far, it's just hilariously bad timing on my part. :P
---
*-zooms in and sees Edgeville-*
---
2Edgy4Me
---
No, the Foefire skins are on sale. 400 gems instead of 500 each.
---
Is there any other way to contact the Order?
---
More like a group of 3-4 Deadeyes sitting in stealth just beyond your starting territory can't 100-0 instagib hapless zerglings trying to make their way back to a group where they can actually function in combat. Poor Deadeye firing squads, no more free bags for minimal effort :(

WE asked on discord who was interested and then we worked on the boss for about 1.5-2 hours

Sorry for image quality, have some of my settings on low in WvW. :-P
---
The fact that this awesome cutscene was marked by the community as "strange video" really shows how replayable Living Story content is.
---
Overload is 5 targets * 10 times = 50 hits.  
---
Meteor shower is 24  times* 3 targets = 66 hits.  
---
Meteor reduces damage from 1.6 coefficient to 0.32 on lowest hit, but overload doesn’t and it does damage and burning, while meteor just do damage.  
---
So... yup, overload does more damage if you are sinister (condi build).
---
Just send support a ticket, they often refund in cases like these
---
Not too weird. As others pointed out both have a lot of similarities in overall shape with that of Europe.
---
Holy shit
---
contact support, they often refund you the gems when something you bought is on sale shortly after your purchase 
---
your sacrifice is welcome.
---
Weird and sad.
---
Can you provide a screenshot of what's bothering you.  I'm not 100% sure what you're talking about.
---
OSRS is honestly worth your time so much more than this dying dumpster fire of a game. Jagex puts out weekly content updates and has some of the best communication with their customers unlike Anet.
---
Get off this sinking ship and join /r/2007scape 
---
Quite a lot tbh. A title in S3 was added for paying 1000g, same episode added an expensive vendor weapons called Carnival Weapons. But even excluding those from HoT to S4 added a large number of tractable weapons and armor, including a full set of legendary armor, weapons, and three backpieces.

I think with the discount code both expansions are $25 together. I'm not sure how much the living stories cost, though. Someone else said 15€ for the living story episodes.
---
Wtf
---
Right on time. Good job, Lightbringer.
---
Thank you commander. 
---
you are talking about a button, when in reality you refer to a UI element. every profession and elite spec has different UI elements for their class mechanics, aka their "f-skills". additionally not every spec uses all keys up to f5.
---
alas, the UI is for the most part static, particularly the skill bar has no alternative settings.
---
since you did not give any information on what spec you are having this trouble with, specific suggestions are somewhat difficult to come up with, and all i can suggest is for you to look into other professions that do not have 5 f-skills
---
They have refunded me gems twice with a week old purchase that then went on sale. Iirc, they're actually legally obligated to refund the difference between a purchase made and the sale if its within 28 days.
---
It's the Engineer, their elite skill is a toolbelt skill now.
---
I've rebound the key but it's still annoying having it there.
---
F5 is clearly a different section on the keyboard and shouldn't be in the same grouping as F1 to F4.
---
**What is it that keeps you involved in this game over smth like Ff14 or eso which offers an actual endgame?**  
---
\- Combat gameplay.  
---
\- Build variety and all the possibilities.  
---
\- I like to play all game modes, so I still have content. And a lot of achievements that I wanna do when I feel like doing achievements...
---
\- WvW gameplay style that I cant find elsewhere.  
---
\- Friends playing.
---
\- No endless grind requirement, I can do whatever I feel like to do.
---
\- Business model, not pay2win.
---
\- Fashion Wars.
---
\- Having alts.  
---
\- I like Raids and Fractals and Dungeons. And still never touched Dhumm, and W6.  
---
https://i.imgur.com/5Z5hbMi.png?1
---
Basically F5 shouldn't be grouped with F1 to F4.
---
It's a completely different F group setting.
---
People actually do this?
---
I don't have any charr :( I tend to stick to salads and humans. 
---
With siege weapons :D
---
Walls are meant to give the defenders a serious advantage over the attacking site. They should be very challenging for the attackers. That's their purpose. 
---
To be clear, I am a real WvW noobie and do not have  much experience. But getting shot of walls is s.th I encountered by myself quite a lot, plus I like to dig in historical medieval channels and like to have a tad realism in my games, even if they are fantasy ones. Taking all this into account I thought I could present you my point of view about this. 
---
Isn't in the gem store. Maybe they haven't updated yet.
---
Hey Etheri,
---
No.
---
Much love, You're still dodging the duel.
---
&gt; If you haven’t visited Tyria for a while, welcome back! It can be  overwhelming to start catching up, or to know what you’ve missed—so to  help you get up to speed on Living World Season 4, we’ll have  livestreams \[...\]
---
And the winner is ... April the 30th ! My two cents on this day for episode 6. 
---
^(And while i'm writing this i'm thinking "do they celebrate May the 1st in USA ?" If yes, i'm all wrong, no way they launch an episode just before a day off... The waiting begins to be long.)
---
I have 3 haha, I love the uniqueness of it. I tried a houseplant briefly but the animations felt so generic and stiff.

* Generally, though, you'll want to gear Berserker for most cases (Power, precision, ferocity) for gearing as you level. Try to upgrade your armor every 5 or 10 levels. Exotic at lvl 80 should be your end goal, don't worry about ascended yet. As for amulets/rings, you can use laurels to get them quickly or just use exotic ones. Once you're at 80 and you have exotic (or better) gear, play the expansions!
---
* Biggest quality of life purchases: Account Inventory Slots (you get two for free when you buy PoF and HoT, one for each expansion), Copper-Fed Salvage-o-Matic, if a permanent lounge pass is ever in the store nab it up fast, permanent mining tools (my advice is to only buy them in a 3 pack), Bank Tabs if they're cheap, Material Storage Expanders.
---
Also check the story journal.
---
No May the 1st celebration in Murica that I know if.
---
&gt; What is it that keeps you involved in this game over smth like Ff14 or eso which offers an actual endgame?
---
Outdpsing ppl on my plaguedoctor scourge.
---
how do you get this? do you have to have a lvl 80 char? Mine is only lvl 42 and I don't see any of this in the gem store. Bought both expansions a couple of weeks ago, so that's not the problem.
---
All classes are viable. Not all classes are optimal. Which ones are depends on game mode and gameplay style.
---
f5 is right where it should be, where would you want it? above your elite skill? 
---
Praise your answer! \\o/
---
Can i begin a religion for you ? xD
---
It's also 50% off just PoF if you already have HoT.
---
SW corner of Desert BL team spawn, some enemies set up "camp" at that camp immediately north of said spawn. Players need to dismount to glide down or hope they know how to hit the tree correctly so they don't just straight-up die from fall damage if they want to remain mounted. A group of Deadeyes whose team owned the camp set up there to fire on my allies approaching the camp, most of which didn't seem to feel the need to remount while approaching and they trickled in one-by-one.
---
I was one of the players that walked right into that.
---
Rather than RuneScape, I played Tibia in the late 90s. Also similar in the sense that there were no defined goals. I don't know anything about RuneScape, but Tibia literally had no main quest. Most quests were hidden in NPC dialogue that you had to figure out the right question to ask in order to even find information about them. So it was largely about personal achievements. It having uncapped level, and early on permanent death as well, made it very choose your own adventure.. while grinding your ass off. So in a way I also had a first experience that was more like GW2 than games like Lineage and World of Warcraft which didn't resonate with me - and more recently, FFXIV. 
---
It's actually kind of weird because in single player I'm generally not a fan of open worlds, but in MMOs I hate being constricted by quests and in particular doing specific things and returning to a quest giver. Elements that really weren't present in Tibia, and aren't in GW2 either.
---
&gt;centaurs got six of them
---
Are centaurs technically insects?
---
Oh wow so there is a queue sometimes? well thats good news actually! I'm playing off peak hours so I think I should just go on the one with the most population.   
---
I tried a google search for population in gw2 but apparently they don't release that info. Any way of knowing? Or at least have an idea...
---
Currently: [this](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~0!c~0!d~1-80131;1-80248;1-80190;1-80111;1-80356;1-80399;1-86098;1-30688;1-30691;1-30697). Won't take more than a month (for the provisoner tokens).
---
Muhahahaaaa !
---
I mainly play co-op with my wife and it is great.  You can get some incredible synergy between classes and you never step on each other's toes.
---
Yes same for me. I'd leave them basic gathering tools on all my toons. Make swapping to unlimited ones a breeze. Great minds think alike! 
---
Working on gathering all I will need to craft the next legendary greatsword on release. 
---
I am currently farming the last 70 amalgamated gemstones through the wvw reward track..
---
For this one I think you need to "purchase" it, unlike when episodes initially air. It's free, but it won't immediately unlock if it's like the Long Live the Lich episode.
---
Well, not an “official” celebration. 
---
Yes.
---
Shoot yes, this is the correct advice. Should display the episode like Long Live the Lich did, with a "0 gems" purchase amount. I apologize and I'm going to amend my previous post to avoid confusing others.
---
I dont mind classes, but people that dont understand whats good and why on a basic level are more likely to wipe which is why I avoid groups like that
---
Player activity in wvw is, as it always has been, heavily server-dependent. With one exception, that hasn't changed. If you are in an active wvw server and play during peak hours, then that's your answer.
---
If you are not in an active wvw server, then the exception may apply: world linking. Less-active servers are grouped weekly with one or more active servers, so that they fight on the same "team" for the duration of the matchup (Friday through Friday). In that case, your wvw experience will depend more on the activeness of whichever more-active server your less-active server is grouped with. 
---
Also, because wvw is a 24/7 thing, some servers have better around-the-clock coverage than others. If you do not play during peak hours, then your wvw experience will depend largely on how good your team's around-the-clock coverage is.
---
The best way to answer your own question would be for you to hop in during your usual play time and see for yourself.
---
Also, the recent release of the wvw warclaw mount brought a ton of new players in. However, that hype has largely settled down by this point.
---
http://gw2stats.com/matchups
---
Same thing I've been working on for over a year: Coalescence.
---
Alright thanks that explains a lot. I guess I will check a few days in a row to see which one is best.
---
When you try to transfer to a different server it will have a population rating that is completely based on WvW activity.  Scroll further down on the link I sent you to "List of Worlds" for a preview.
---
Also, be aware that a new system might be in place soon:
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/61986/world-restructuring-update-2#latest
---
Eh, it's just my experience. Attacking zergs tend to put more effort in compared to defenders. I've never seen shield gens used properly in defense other than blocking treb shots.
---
Awesome thanks! So is it fair to assume that the server who has the highest score is probably the most active?
---
I can not see it being free in gamestore.
---
Right!? i even upvoted it 😂
---
Right now I'm working towards promoting a WvW heavy armor set to legendary. I've got half the ascended set so far and will be promoting it piece-by-piece until I have it all done. 
---
It's listed as costing 200 gems unfortunately. I might contact support. 
---
It did not work at the moment. Tested it with a twink account and there is no discount available at the moment. Normally you don't need anything. You simply have to unlock it via store but you can only play if you own pof.
---
The issue is not them being in stealth, the issues is that they get out of combat whilst i am still in combat from them engaging me. Last night it was me and my friend having the issue several times and one of them was with a messmer who engaged us. We got him down to 20% hp, he stealth 3 sec later he mounts up and ride off. We are still in combat by him still being in our range riding off and we can still not mount up until about 10 sec later but then he is 1, On his mount and 2. To far off for us wanting to hunt him so we leave it. This was a fight he started, he got us in to combat, he get out of combat in stealth still close to us and we do not. He rides away. I call bull shit on that especially since it is something that happen every day. Check for your self and you will notice that something is not right there. If i am in combat by him he should not be able to mount up. We should both be out of combat at the same time unless i hit something else ofc.
---
Everytime I switch to RuneScape after playing GW2 for a long time , I find most things are very similar.
---
lol i'm on the guy who rides a horse with a big spear.  it's a tough game. 
---
that is intense.  
---
orr does have a lot of risen gorillas tho
---
Oh y and last 2 are also Human Females. God forbid am furry or plant or short or something ^
---
Given that you prbly will get all s4 episodes for free in the next weeks you have to buy pof and hot - 25 bucks with the 50% discount - and than season 3 (47% discounted to 650-ish gems (roughly 7 bucky but you cannot buy less than 800 gems for 10 atm). Season two is the more expensive one (25% discounted to 1200 gems) but as stated by you you already own this one. So with about 35 bucks - and logging in once per week for the next five / four weeks - you will have everything up to date.
---
Yes, check out the [Mesmer](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Mesmer). All mesmer builds summon illusions which are short-lived minions that you constantly respawn in battle.
---
Also for open world PvE one of the strongest class/builds is [a Necro/Reaper summon build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Reaper_-_Power_Minion_Master). Necro minions are not great in rids though.
---
Falador would be divinities reach or lions arch
---
*Sigh.* Do I really need another login rewards account? It's good gold but I don't know if I want more accounts to have to log into.
---
Cleaning up raid achievements I could never be bothered with and saving gold from raiding and fractals for home instance nodes. I would adore proper player housing. 
---
Raids in this game are very, very straight forward in this game compared to other MMOs. Everything is viable in the sense that you can clear all content with not "meta" in every slot. Whether or not people will take you is a whole other story.
---
But if you had your own group of friends/raiders you played with, you all could go through the content at a nice pace with non-meta comps. By that metric, I would say all classes are viable.
---
"Based on your feedback we decided to fix these problems &amp; we are happy to announce you incoming exclusive PvP mounts\*"
---
Insulting the devs isn’t gonna make them do what you want 
---
Thats what I did for pharus.   Dont forget if you do the auric, tangled and dragonstand metas, a amalgamated gemstone is a choice in the reward chest so thats 3 more per day you can get.
---
sPVP legendary armor. Got the chest and boots last season, can't wait for the next season to start! Not even sure what to do with the down time, just doing story and central Tyria stuff.
---
I'm at 34778 working towards 35k
---
I’ve got 9 characters so I’m working on finishing up gearing all of them with ascended. Decided to finish up the Knight of Thorn achievement line while I’m at it too, but it’s been an expensive journey haha.
---
T1/2 are pretty ez mode, mobs dont hit hard, attack slower, have less hp, few instabilities, ar is a guide line and not a requirement. Once you hit T3  shit gets real, everything hits harder, attacks faster and if you are missing even a point of AR agony will seriously hurt if not down you. T3 is the trenches because players face rolled thru T1/2 with what ever build and team composition and nothing mattered. 
---
Learn the mechanics of the different fractals, effective ways to mitigate instability combos, dont be afraid to speak up and make sure the grp is on the same page BEFORE people start quitting. I find pinging particularly painful instabs to remind the party whats active can help (people dont always pay attention to that stuff) As for finding LFG, aim to do fractals around reset if possible. LFG the busiest then. Outside of that getting help into T4's is a fine option if you are looking to be a member of a team and earning glorious victory together.... less so if you are looking for a free carry everytime you log in(dont be that guy).
---
This is awesome. Good on you, Anet
---
I have one day left on The Wayfarer's Henge, and I'm slowly farming for Xiuquatl (my first legendary) while working on the collections for Aurora. Also leveling some new characters after that character slot sale, too, I guess.
---
Working on the elite spec ascended weapons collections. About halfway through both the HoT and PoF collections.
---
Definitely one of the reasons that made me like GW2. My MMOs growing up were Runescape and Ragnarok, both of which just drop you into the world and let you do whatever. I really hated the guided tour that so many other MMOs try to take you on where they railroad you on a bunch of menial quests. I much prefer just being allowed to roam about.

Thanks for posting this!  I just talked my husband into playing again and need to get him the expacs.  Since I already have them, I'm not sure I'd have noticed this without your post.
---
-Still wanna get into raids. 
---
-saving a bit of gold for legendary armor (but need raids for that *sadface* )
---
-getting into fractal cm’s

&gt;If you missed picking up the first episode of Living World Season 4 while it was live, visit the Gem Store in game to unlock “Daybreak” for free! All players can also grab a free Tradesman’s Package this week in the Gem Store (limit one per account). These items will be available from March 26 until April 1.

&gt; How can a game like this keep semi-hardcore players invested when all there is to the endgame is Collection logs and train grinding for gold and Karma?
---
For me, it was always about being able to play through the newest content, try out new builds, gear out a new WvW character, acquire and keep my mastery points maxed, working my way through fractals, doing the occasional raid, playing map events for skins and profit, craft the legendary weapons I like and collecting interesting skins. I had a ton of stuff to do even though I wasn't always improving my character's ability to hit things harder.
---
The last six months have been rough for me. I haven't been interested in a new legendary in a long time, new masteries don't add much value to my character, WvW needs love but is largely ignored, we've gotten one fractal in the past year with no other updates.
---
It seems like every single resource at ANet's disposal has been dumped into living world which, quite frankly, I don't give a damn about. That content isn't sticky. I play the story once and never touch it again. I think most of the dialog belongs on r/cringe, unskippable cutscenes make it impossibly agitating to go for story achievements, and zero good map events have been added since HoT.
---
My wife likes to kill Tequatl, so we log in every night and do that and then I help her with map completion. When she goes to bed, I log into PoE of FF14.
---
Why are gems from 3rd party sites so much cheaper than those in the gemstore?
---
$30 for 2 accounts seems like a steal to me. I already 2 so doubling my accounts for the price of 1 is great.
---
Anet said in the link up top: ''... from March 26th to April 1st''
---
It won't be free until tomorrow, it says that promo starts March 26th.
---
Oh, I was suppose to switch?
---
Literally exactly what I had been waiting for. Upgrade purchased and applied, time to ride. :)
---
If you think that's bad, take the world map from Ultima 7 (released 1992) and rotate it 45' to the left.
---
I'd say anything goes really, but it's harder to keep track of then.
---
I actually tried Warrior and it wasn't as high as I'd hoped, definitely below Soulbeast.
---
The maximum I achieved when testing further just now was [340.8% on Weaver](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/413053842171625474/559791687753400320/unknown.png). Ascended berserker gear, Scholar runes, 3-2-2 in Air. BSSBSS, Furious Sharpening Stone, Banners, AP. Use Lightning Hammer, Arcane Power and fully attune to Air.
---
You could get a little more with [Sigil of Cruelty](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Sigil_of_Cruelty) and Elemental Surge in Arcane.
---
No I was not looking at authorized retailers.
---
I was looking at sites like mmoga or insta gaming. 2k gems are way cheaper there. For the record, I want to support the game and I don't care if 2k gems are a bit more expensive in the ingame gemstore. But the difference is huge. 80 gems for 1€ ingame or ~120gems for 1€ from 3rd party sites
---
Damn, can't help with that, I know nothing of Max, I open these with Noesis and/or Blender (Noesis is fast for previewing all this mess, eventually in Blender you can open all meshes from the folder at once). Are you sure all meshes got ripped? NR isn't really reliable with this and you might not got everything with the first scan, I usually set the forced interval on 10-15 secs and repeat it twice or trice.
---
(also NR mirrorflips everything, doesn't get meshes with cloth physics right, characters ripped in game instance tend to turn out better than from char selection screen).
---
Gonna up vote this.
---
Have access to a 3d metal printer &amp; knowing the solution would be amazing.
---
Meh I gave up on it when it became evident that even recording and posting the cheaters on youtube wouldn't get them banned anymore.
---
If you have 2 shatters up, use a shatter rotation. If not, use the filler. Be sure to read over the [guide page](https://snowcrows.com/raids/guides/mesmer/mirage/condition/) as well for more tips. 
---
IRL, nothing in game feels worth it sadly
---
Yes, because they can help u in ur story instance and u can help them. 
---
Only in the expansions u can do the stories together and progress together. If u have a 5 man group of friends u can pretty much fight and do most events in the old and new maps. After so many years, I only play GW2 with friends now. It’s just better, plus it’s a bit hard to play solo (not because of the game being difficult but because I’ve lost a bit of interest and I’ve done most of the end game content, which doesn’t mean I’ve done everything of course! :D). 
---
Visit their YouTube page - they have all the living world videos organized by season.  They've been adding them over the past few days.
---
Ive been working on it for ages.  I come back to gw2 to catch up on the story from time to time and ill get another stage of the backpiece completed usually.  I think i started on it like 2 years ago
---
Wouldn't be against having a bit more boon removal spread across classes but scrapper &amp; especially guard are dependent on their boons.
---
Take that down and they become rather crap.
---
They need to be a better deal than buying in game, or there would be no purpose in using anything but the in game store
---
That being said, buying gems from unauthorized retailers is against the ToS and can lead to a ban, so it doesn't seem all that worth the risk
---
Upgrading my 2nd account to POF for warclaw.  Thanks for the heads up!
---
Oh it's definitely a great value. But I've already got 7 accounts I only log in and gather on in addition to my main account, and adding another two feels like a bit of a chore. Perhaps if I control myself and don't create additional characters to park at rich nodes and instead really just collect the login rewards.
---
Not necessarily. The amount of kills+deaths is a pretty good indicator though, as you can see [here](https://wvwstats.com/leaderboard) (scroll down to activity)
---
In addition to what some have said about axe, Infinite Horizons turns the scepter ambush skill into a pretty spectacular application of confusion and torment.  Try it out.
---
The only character I actually had to level up to 80 was my first one. After that, Tomes of Knowledge will come around pretty easily if you want, and you'll be able to play any class you want at top level.
---
It says 200 gems for me ...
---
Interesting, do you often work for free for your company??? 
---
&gt; I wish they made more chest/leggings pieces
---
They're a bit different but I certainly see the similarities. I wonder if one drew inspiration from the other?
---
Also, wow, thanks for the blast of nastolgia.
---
Just an FYI.  The game is fun but it's not really fun until you're level 80.  My friends and I all started at the same time and I'm the only one still playing because they never got a character to max lever.  That's really when the game starts imo.  Buying the game gets you straight to level 80 though rather than the free version.  And it's half off right now if that helps.  
---
T4wised, I have the following 3 classes just finished gearing, which one you like to see the most in runs?
---
1. Power Quickbrand 35% boon dur
---
2. Diviner Renegade 100% alacrity uptime
---
3. Harrier Quickbrand 
---
I don't know why, but "My wife likes to kill Tequatl..." just struck me as quite funny.  Really made me chuckle. I envision this angry "Die die die!!!"  Followed by a sigh of contentment afterward and then "Ah...  much better.  I can go to sleep happy now that I have rid the world of that evil."
---
he's an ele you clown :)
---
I would totally read this!!! 😆🤩
---
Or at least make them funny.
---
\^This guy gets it. There's also a difference between playing the game &amp; actually delving into the lore of the world &amp; discovering what all the obscure, dead-content places really are.
---
i've been rotational lately as the LW seasons come out and my interest in doing raids/fractals has waned.  I'll focus the new LW content for maybe 3 or 4 weeks trying to complete the major things on my checklist of things i want to finish.  Then I can ease off the grind a bit and casually work on achievements or collections I have on my list like building up other toons' in-game lore (that's been my thing lately with new toons as an exercise).
---
Right now I still log on every day now to work on long term collections but I'm not going at it for 4 hours a night like during LW release.  In 2 hours I can do basic dailies, thunderhead north and south meta and maybe fit in death branded shatterer with some breaks between metas.  After that I can jump off and play some other games or work on side projects.
---
Don’t get me wrong - the boon strip is incredibly powerful if you land it. But WoD’s bread and butter, and the main reason this change was a buff, is WoD’s boon *denial*. Meaning boons cannot be applied to enemies if they are within it’s aoe, which now can chase them down. 
---
That is the main power behind WoD. Not the actual strip itself, and definitely not the lightning field. 
---
It’s the only skill in the game, to my knowledge, that *denies* boon application to enemies. 
---
Oh of course, so finding the list of authorized retailers for gems is a little more finicky. I'd stick to big well known stores if possible, rather than the common resellers
---
Props to you. I'm working on Warbringer, which is like 1/3 of the tickets, and even that is a total grind.
---
Oh.. yea then it's weird
---
Unique (green color) gear in GW1 was simply pre-made gear with all stats maxed and unique names, but their stats were still as standard as the gear you could generate with a PvP character. 
---
With a very few exceptions, there was no gear with unique stats. You could get a white/blue weapon that could have the same exact stats as a purple, gold or green.  The only real diffrence between the drops is that higher rarity gear dropped with better upgrades and had a higher chance to drop with lower requirements. Except unique gear, that drop with fixed stats.
---
You must be mixing them up with some other game. 
---
It's relatively fast. If you go VB Matriarch starting at xx:10 --&gt; TD at xx:30 --&gt; AB at (xx+1):00, that's 3 per day for about an hour of your time (and probably only 30 minutes of actual "work"). It's also extremely rare for a meta to fail anymore.
---
K?
---
Selling GF 10k gp
---
Nice, I routinely get the Greatsaw and Chain sword skin. Congrats!
---
Didn't know the April Fools release notes were out already ;p
---
And here I am, not even started on crafting ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
It's a promotional event.
---
Nothing, playing other games.
---
I finished legendary armors, the bubble aquabreather, and now i'm focusing on Pharus.
---
And Bolt after that, i'm planning on getting 1 legendary per weapon, i still miss Lbow, Sbow, Wh, Shield, sword and scepter.
---
My problem is that, aside from bolt and howler, i don't know what to craft next, i'd really want Astralaria, but i crafted Frostfang eons ago and i don't even need another axe for my toons.
---
1,000,000 account value. Another 170k to go.
---
Ahh this is putting me on a nostalgia trip.
---
Runescape was my first MMO, started it in 2004 back when I was in 8th grade. Jesus christ I used to be so hooked on that game... tried a few times to quit but ended up always coming back, up until late 2012 when Jagex fucked the game for good with EoC.

My friend I hope you changed your mind on this. As someone with both harrier druid and soulbeast dps they're both super viable and I find soulbeast more fun
---
It's been a considerable amount of time since I actually looked at the keybinds mine are set to, but I believe they are something like Ctrl+F1/F2/F3, etc. 
---
As for where to put those keybinds, I'm going to assume you don't have a keyboard with macro keys on them, and we've got six mounts (seven if you include the Warclaw, which I'm not getting and therefore don't.) My keybinds are specifically because I have those combinations bound to G1-G6 on my keyboard as single button presses. If I didn't have G-keys or mouse keys available to enable arcane or awkward key combos, I'd probably use something more tame like Z/X/C with Shift or Ctrl as a modifier, or Shift and Ctrl as modifiers for only two of those.
---
In the end, it seems like you've done some work with your keybinds already, so you'll have to take a look at things and experiment with what feels reasonable and what doesn't.
---
I also tought about it but wanted to present the "original" stats, and therefore i didn't even need to sell them, only taking the prices from the TP and calculated
---
but indeed i sold most of them later on since i was too lazy to convert them and even the time i spent on the tp to sell them was quite too much\^\^
---
Apparently it doesn't become free until tomorrow. Anets original post was very misleading and just had the end date of April 1. Now it has the start date of the 26th https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/welcome-back-to-guild-wars-2-week-one/

What are friends? :o
---
^(someone had to do it &gt;.&lt;)
---
We may be able to work out a predicted release date for Episode 6 however, as it looks like they will be doing an episode a week on top of SAB, they would hit Episode 6 on April 30th, plus the Wiki has a TBA for date of free access listed for it for that episode.  If they are following an exact week by week, it could easily be released then, or add an extra week for the sake of people catching up. 
---

---
Dude. *Check the username.* I'm clearly not who you think I am.
---
It's weird that they never put HoT on sale directly.
---
PoF goes on sale every month and you can always apply the PoF discount to the PoF+HoT bundle.
---
It says in the article that the sales begin March 26th - aka tomorrow.
---
Oops. Posted it on the wrong account. Let me go get the correct one.
---
I cannot apply the promo code a second time, to a different account, it says "invalid promo code", anyone else?
---
Problem is none of that is really wanted in raids or fractals.
---
Anet really needs to standardize a number of effects so that unique boons go the way of the dodo &amp; more people can provide stuff.
---
After that up the number of people that can boon strip.
---
&gt; ean...you're free to be wrong...but a statement like that means I can't really take anything else you say seriously.
---
&gt; Next you'll be telling me sriracha goes great with pancakes and maple syrup. Or Nickleback is more influential than the Beatles.
---
no idea what sriracha is not we use to eat pancakes in italy (jesus christ that's not a breakfast) nor i ever listened a single song from nickelback. but i love beatles if that's ok for you.
---
but no, eotm is not boring . but hey it's just point of view. that's the problem : you think everyone play the game the same way
---
there was a guy who levelled 80 without leaving the starting dreaming zone of the silvari. can u belive it ? crazy for me . suppose he enjoyed doing it.
---
I'll be sure to let you know once I find some ;P.
---
Does anyone know how long this promo code will work for? I have some friends who could use it, but some have to wait before they can buy it. So I wanted to make sure it will last at least up til April?
---
Wait, people make multiple accounts? GW2 always came off to me as a game that you only needed one, but is there some other benefits to having multiple besides gold? And is it allowed? :o
---
WvW reward tracks, i got hooked because of the mount
---
I have 3 tracks half finished &gt;.&lt;
---
Neat! thanks.
---
People mostly get alt accounts for the login rewards and bypassing account limit purchases like the envelopes during LNY. I doubt people put as much effort in them as their main account.
---
No exoskeleton or segmented bodies.

Today i gambled a bit with the toilet and dropped 2 "the chosen". 450 gold ez, 
---
So how did it work? Sharing now doesn’t matter anyway since they are disabled until fixed.
---
with just a dash of Splatoon
---
Nah. Keep it how it is. 
---
I hope Aurene is really dead im sick of that ressurection BS
---
I think I figured out a system.  I used my mount key from the radial menu as my general mount button and moved the specific mounts to the num pad.  I mostly WvW(which only need the one general mount button), PvP and fractals once in a while so I think this should work ok as I don't use a bunch of different mounts all the time.  I installed the d12pxy and my frame rate went up dramatically, so it's totally worth it.  👍
---
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh that reference xD
---
Thank you so much. New player, got to 20, really liking the game so I was about to purchase the expansions when I saw this. You just saved me 25 bucks, much obliged.
---
Yeah. It makes me sad how boring most of their attack animations look compared to everything else.
---
Human thiefs twirl their knives around... And then char just go slash slash.
---
Death blossom is an acrobatic display with most races. And then charr barely do a barrel roll.
---
I get they are huge cats... But even huge cats do acrobatic feats
---
Although that tip is certainly as good as gold and I greatly appreciate it, a large part of the reason I decided to do the achievement is because I’m gearing my characters, meaning I need each one of the five ascended weapons. As far as I know, they’re the cheapest ascended around besides some of the specialization collection variants
---
I would be in tears if I read a warrior buff in patch :,)
---
Does the expansions come in keys when it is bought or is it automatically added to my account? As i alr own PoF and HoT isnt on sale
---
Exploit suspensions incoming!
---
Alright, if you actually want five physical weapons, then my advice doesn't help you out.  Sorry!
---
All good! Thanks for the advice all the same :)
---
Slomoooo
---
A 3D *metal* printer? That sounds exciting.
---
I still dream of patch where warrior dagger and gs will get skills that actually work :o
---
Massive thanks, new player was about to buy and decided to check the sub. 25 dollars saved!
---
Bought it last week myself. Real feels good moment
---
Not surprising considering what meta loot changes we've seen over the years. I imagine they only now got to it since it was being popularized a bit more with LS4 meta train people talking about it and thus more people doing it.
---
Good time to do it with the 50% off the expansions promo going on right now!
---
Doubtful considering how they've not taken actions against players taking advantage of things like Auric Basin multi-loot or parking multiple characters at jumping puzzle chests. Not that they should now either since they've already set the precedent. Best just to fix this unintended loophole and not do it in the future, yet again.
---
don't really understand why they'd bother fixing this TODAY when there will be no point of doing this after the unid gear change tomorrow but go off i guess 
---
Eat what cannot be eaten?
---
The map currency still has its inherent value I suppose?
---
This has been a thing for months and now they fix it... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy8Cj8jtAw4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy8Cj8jtAw4) 
---
I think there is a big lack of Diviner Renegade. The meta of ren+fb is fairly new and more common in CM runs. I run Alacritygade for a few weeks now and it comes with some waiting time but the runs are so much smoother. Gladly there are Healbrands from WvW.
---
If you rather have very low waiting times I'd suggest to go Quickbrand in full berzerker. The boon duration comes from potions :) you can easily switch to Dragonhunter if a dps is needed while as alacrity renegade you are more stuck to a firebrand. 
---
Healbrand and Heal renegade use the same Armour plus staff. While Healbrand healing feels better for pugs you can also try heal renegade and group with a Quickbrand.
---
One LPT at the end: Add, as an Alacritygade, the Healbrand from your runs to your friends list and see if they are available for future runs. It reduced the waiting a lot for me
---
You can also queue for PvP while dead, causing you to respawn in the room. Even if the meta isn't up, you still have a few seconds to loot as many chests as you can using quickness and any damage mitigation you can do while opening chests. 
---
More recently, people using teleportation hacks have been teleporting in there, as the chests seem to reset per hour per character. (heard from people who cheat)
---
Genius 
---
There's nothing wrong with elite spec having an actual specific role in specific content rather than being overstacked with mechanics and OP in every single game mode because it can do everything. If it's useless in raids so be it, it's unbalanced in other parts of the game. You can also introduce new raids where it can be useful, it's not like raids have been creative lately.
---
Druid is meta in pve because of offensive supporting that's rather static, which is completely worthless in wvw/pvp where you need mobile and defensive support. It has pretty decent alternatives in pve and it fits different role in pvp modes. That's an example of good balance, having versatility, but not being able to do everything at once. 
---
FB is nowhere close to being balanced. Same goes with scrapper, it used to be somewhat irrelevant before patch and suddenly it's one of the strongest specs in pvp/wvw, neither of those is a good thing. They also have no alternatives in pvp/wvw because their uniqueness is mandatory where they matter and on top of that uniqueness they provide a lot more than other classes (which lack that strong uniqueness). Basically it's the 3 year ago chrono+druid of wvw and pvp. 
---
Just going to say that, I hope you don't plan to profit in any way from this (or claiming to have created it), because it could be considered stealing from GW2's artists. x\_x But if you're just doing it for personal use like for decoration for home, and not for sale then I think it should be ok.
---
Yeah, not a lot of people knew, cuz Kourna was kinda lame in general. But the exploit got popular/more common after awhile because people would catch on that other players were switching alts in the chest room. The thing was, you didn't even have to do the Meta, just the pre. As soon as the green gas went away you could just log on to your alts, grab the chests and leave - not even having to finishing the Meta.
---
Oh yeah! I gave it a try but it's not nearly as fun as the original days, largely in part because people are just too good at gaming these days unlike back then. Like I still remember in 2004 it was a rumor that 126 combat was even possible because no one had actually done it. Then Lilyuffie88 became the first to get 99 prayer, followed by Zezima afterwards who became the first to fully max out
---
Wilderness was far more active with more pking all over the place instead of just congregated to edgeville. Most overpowered weapons in the game were dds and magic shortbow. Damn, good times.
---
I think it's great that they're releasing new content, but I dunno. Maybe I've just gotten too old for it, but the game is hard to get motivated to do stuff with and isn't quite the same as I remember it. Totally different community and whatnot.
---
My RSN on OSRS is "Amluv" if you want to see how far I got in stats. At one point I was top 100 in herblore but I gave up a few months into the launch.
---
I thought it mightve meant that we were going back in time to fix a few things so that the future/present would be saved.   
---
Not sure if I'd like that narrative direction though.
---
Getting good at the game.  
---
I am not currently collecting anything specific, I am just trying to get good.   
---
I play Mesmer and I want to be a good Support Chrono in Fractal CMs and Raids, as well as PVP and WVW.  
---
Carrying your Group through 100CM, a flawless rotation on a Raidboss, winning a 2v1 in WVW roaming - that stuff gets me going much more than any rewards in the game  
---
Yet again players showcase why Anet has to design content in mind that it will be exploited/abused to hell. I'm not surprised at this as I expect the worst from this community. If they can't exploit a event to get x10 the loot then they will berate and moan nonstop.
---
r/guildrecruitment
---
At first I was thinking the same thing... But I mean, look at how long it took them to fix AB multi mapping.
---
K
---
How important would 4k diamonds be for quality of life purchases (like tools that don't break and a salvage kit that lasts)?
---
...Now that's a crossover no one knew they wanted
---
How is it a strange video when the title clearly tells you what it is?
---
i was just asking cuz your post kinda screams of confirmation bias
---
i did have my fair share of dreadful fractal runs which included a chrono with 250kp+ that could only manage 0.2 quickness and always hugged the floor.. maybe lag, maybe chatcodes, who knows really?
---
to address some other points:
---
finding a static at so low kp might be a tad unrealistic, unless your performance is as good as you claim and you get people willing to give you a shot..most statics do strive for optimization though, both strat-wise and comp-wise
---
playing as/with necro is gonna make people wary but that's pretty much it, overall
---
if the run is terrible then..just leave? you can find a better group and it's not uncommon to see 99cm+t4 because the 100cm run was trash
---
personally, i rarely leave unless the people are both unable to pull the fight off mechanically AND unwilling to adapt to it, namely change some skills or traits to increase the success chance
---
all in all i really don't think it's as gloom and doom as you make it seem..i get that you're tilted but as my grandma used to say "if you can't fix it don't complain about it"
---
The 800 Gems for the copper salvage kit is very convenient. Throw it into the free shared inventory slot you get with an expansion to use it across all alts. 
---
Unlimited gathering tools are useful but they need shared inventory slots (3 slots for 3 tools) if you wish to use them on multiple alts. You can get by with keeping an extra unused tool in your inventory and restocking whenever you're in town
---
The core philosophy behind combat and builds in each mode is different, mainly because of what you're fighting. 
---
In PvE, you want to kill your enemy before they kill you, so you go all in on damage (or for support/heal builds, as much as you can without sacrificing your support capability), especially since enemies usually telegraph attacks that will cause huge burst damage, so you can avoid them through dodging, barrier, or mechanics. Enemies in PvE also don't really cure their conditions much, don't usually evade/block attacks or heal, nor do they have lots of boons, especially defensive ones like stability, aegis, protection, resistance, etc.
---
In PvP/WvW, you're going up against players with the same tools as you do, dodging, cleansing, all boons, healing etc. Plus they've got similar health pools, so you can't just burst them down quickly. Therefore, builds usually go for a mix between burst damage and survivability, since you can't reliably beat enemies down quickly, nor reliably over time, because they've got good survivability and will just heal if they're too low. Conditions aren't as strong in PvP/WvW (which as a condi berserker main, makes me sad) unless you apply a buttload of different ones, since they'll just cleanse a few conditions, and even with a bunch, they'll just pop resistance. Plus, stability is much more important than in PvE, since stability lets you finish someone without being interrupted by most downed skills. Finally, survivability is even more important since your opponents don't really telegraph their attacks (besides some cast times or continuous effects), so dodging isn't as effective.

That's per day per account and the limit is for the chests that have icons on the minimap. The meta room had one of those chests and like 3ish of "meta" chests that didn't contribute to that limit iirc.

I thought it was a trailer to episode 6 as well.  When you glance quickly at the notification on your phone and not read the title and only see the preview picture of the video, it makes it seem like it was a new episode trailer, since most preview pictures look the same for all their videos.

How do you mean?

How many coffees do we need to Ko-Fi you to get some charr with breasts art commissioned?

I tried to open .obj file from 3D Ripper in 3DS Max but in all these textures I can't even find my character. There are npcs (just silhouettes), buildings, even field of corn but no model of my character.
---
Maybe place was too big? Where did you rip your character at? You got neat effect.

slightly unrelated but i wish they would also remove more of the blanket-ban on items inside raids..
---
they only allow musical instruments and some chairs as of now..even with the 5min reapplication requirement, it would still be nice to be able to actually use the item inside raids

If only the dev responsible for anything to do with Malyck wasn't.. well.. you know.

This is how I got HoT when PoF first came out &gt;.&gt; 
---
I did buy PoF at full price though and haven't even played those parts yet.

I think Anet is aware that this happens, otherwise they would've updated their automatic key authorization with online stores a long time ago. Still, the deal is two keys. If you have a key, but don't need it yes give it away to friendos

That much magic would cause the death of everything that's not an elder dragon, though.

That's not only the GW2 community, that's the whole mankind. It's typically human to find ways to get more of whatever than you usually get. Not only ingame.
---
Yea what? Both are still meta in PvP and WvW

It's pretty active on all maps during prime time. Even during late hours on NA, there are usually big fights on EBG.
