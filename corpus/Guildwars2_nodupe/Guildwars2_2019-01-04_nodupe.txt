Ascended trinkets are a full 10% (okay 9.5) better than exotics, *and* since trinkets make up a larger portion of your stat total than either weapons or armor, that difference is even more pronounced. It's not *quite* as big as the jump from rares to exotics but it's higher than any other tier's improvement. Yes, they're still not technically necessary, but it's a substantial enough improvement that it's hard to argue against.
---
---
---
When'd that start? Should've clarified that this was more than ten years ago. It was either in OGW or in CoH, where we met. 
---
I mean, you don't \*have\* to do every CM every day.
---
2018 was not that great, you’re just a bias fanboy. 
---
Which is depressing
---
every year (for maybe 4-5 years?) in gw2, there's a Pink Day in LA. i think it's part of a larger fundraiser for breast cancer research or something like that
---
&gt; As a side note you have to craft, buy or do a collection for backpacks. 
---

---
Do you know what the easiest way would be for a WvWer to get ahold of an ascended backpiece? I don't like doing any PvE at all if I can help it but I was wondering if there's an easy collection I could knock out or something.
---
I don't have to play the game at all! What a relief.
---
Still, it would put more strain on already separate part of a fractal community that does daily cm+t4 runs, further splitting it up. Some will stop doing 99, since, to be honest, it isn't worth the time already reward-wise, some won't be doing the new one and, if I know something about player psychology, there will be plenty of those who will stop doing anything at all. 
---
yes, I know that. my specific server question was just about wvw-part.
---
Well I really like the skull ones.
---
Thanks a lot for the great response, Mesmer and thief interest me the most currently.
---
It seems you already got an answer from the creator of the spreadsheet so I'll back off. :) 
---
I play both games semi-regularly and I just love GW2's content is rewarding no matter what I am doing and I never feel the "grind" like I feel in current WoW. Been grinding Rep for stuff and it's ... there is literally no other way to do it than mission tables and WQs. Also now that i have done every quest for both factions I found myself uninterested in other stuff, where in GW2 the story missions are the BEGINNING of the content and what it opens (collections, achievements, a new map) is just so pleasant. I am knee deep in finishing up the 4th story episode of Season 4 and I am so excited to get my collection on for the new armor skins.
---
Lol yes it is largely unrefined 🤣
---
Oh we did! 😅
---
I didn't play fractals back then, so no. 
---
Fractal God is fine because people aren't expected to have it.
---
I'm also interested in getting Aurora. So thanks for all the info guys. I do have a question, how much gold do I need in total?
---
Yeah, I also returned after many years. It was pretty overwhelming. In the end, I rolled a second thief (my original main) and played it up 40 levels to relearned things. It really helped. After that, it was pretty easy to fast forward to level 80 and start into HoT. 
---
I personally recommend playing HoT the first time without mounts.
---
[Here's a video that explains this "oomph" you're talking about in TERA (tl;dw - Kinaesthetics)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shPMz-zGyRU)
---
If you do WvW you can start on legendary backpack!
---
Warcry is the precursor for it. That way at least you can keep doing WvW.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Warcry
---
Outside of that the Living Season 3 maps have ascended backpacks as well. But you will only get the Core and HoT stats from those. Just need to farm map currency for them. Bitterfrost would be the easiest.
---
[removed]
---
Yeah that sums it up pretty well, the point I was trying to make about the weighty feel of the weapons without them making the game feel slow or clunky.
---
&gt; short single player orientated
---
Excuse me, we're called Asura.
---
thank you, that's actually not as bad as I imagined, is it just regular Celestial infusion (blue) or you used also a Polyluminescent Infusion (teal)?
---
Why is the gift of the desert time gated? I wanna make the shinning blade, but the HoT maps seem like a pain to travel
---
Especially TD
---
But the PoF ones seem a loooot easier to complete,
---
We have springers now and the Tengu said "fuck that".
---
I plan on being there if irl doesn’t get in the way. 
---
I played WoW from BC and quit in the middle of WoD (that expansion killed a part of my soul) then when i started getting into Gw2, i was like "wtf didnt i start playing this sooner, i cant never leave now", i mean there's so many QoL things that i cant give this up. I'll always follow WoW story because i mean in terms of MMO's, WoW gives one of the best storytelling in the market and u cant deny that.
---
Definitely. I played for two years as a free to play before buying an expansion. The base game is amazing.
---
The gift of the rider for the Desert mastery requires 400 elegy mosaics which are dropped from Legendary bounties in randoms amounts ranging from 1-20
---
The funerary incense is time gated on a per day reset for purchase amounts and you need 250 of them.
---
This is so sweet. My husband introduced me to GW2 too and I had never played any video game that wasn’t Super Nintendo or the switch. So it was a huge learning curve for me. When I first started he explained the WASD movement keys, for a while I had no idea the mouse could also control my movement 😂 there’s so much to get used to when you’re starting from scratch, a lot of things he tried to explain were way over my head at first. For me it took time practicing by myself, &amp; staying in open world just killing skelks &amp; whatnot getting used to everything. His explanations helped but it was more helpful when he would cover my ass while I tried to accomplish something so I wouldn’t immediately get killed &amp; discouraged. Now I still suck but am good enough to actually really enjoy it! And he’s still covering my ass while I try to get all the mount masteries lol 
---
I was kind of looking for this comment. This is what makes GW2 hard getting back into for me because, even if i have been away for 4-5 months and come back, I have no idea what i am supposed to do. Grind a month for a different looking sword? As someone that enjoys PvE and aren’t in a guild atm, I have no pass time other than farming gold. 
---
I came back to the game this week and for someone that played during the realese of this game up to HoT there are not many things I can do. Going to check out the new raids and fractals but after that, as I said, it’s just making dollars.
---
I feel this way because I want GW2 to be that game i log onto everyday but it can’t be. It’s a beautiful game with incredibly fun gameplay but the game does not create enough goals for me.
---
(Sorry for spelling)
---
Oh god, I remember the pains of trying to choose which achievement would be easiest and getting those last few core mastery points. Just stick with it and for fractals you can usually LFG to get a group together.
---
yes, three clicks are annoying as hell, sometimes after comments like that I wonder who plays this game and why do I still getting surprised.
---
Great talent!
---
Thank you bookah, very cool 
---
Wow, that's super cool! I don't know if we've ever gotten reference of what their bone structure is like, but if we haven't, Anet should hire you! It looks so spot on to what I'd imagine!
---
HoT's difficulty got towned down a lot because players complaint. All adventures are free since they added a lot of time to get gold on each.
---
Bottom is before, top is after? 
---
I guess they gave the Dominion of Winds the ol' Chicago treatment.

Tip: For backpieces, you do get the opportunity to stat swap them if you infuse them. Obviously, you can only choose from the stat pool for that item (e.g. no PoF stats if you infuse a HoT backpiece), but it's still helpful.
---
I really was hoping you baiting me. I really dont know how to talk with you people and not offend you, so I stop. Peace.
---
&gt; For instance make protection on yourself only 20% and 60% on allies
---
Is this an out of season april's fool joke?
---
They made a post about how they did not like this way to purely level and a ban was on the way but the community spoke out and it was cancelled. Instead he was just suspended for 3 days, I believe. That is how.
---
Or past updates. This area overlaps with the Rollerbeetle practice course. Sadly, I think they just lowered the ground and put the finish line here, nothing more to it.
---
One solution would be to always have one of the three CM fractals as normal mode daily 
---
weapons have fixed skills, and generally speaking each weapon is tied to a specific use (burst damage, condition damage, utility, cc, support etc).
---
Warrior longbow is focused on burning, swords are focused on bleeding, and greatsword is focused on burst cleaving dmg.
---
dagger is also focused on raw dmg and not on conditions.
---
If you use dual swords (condi) and greatsword (burst raw dmg) you need to fix your gear stats accordingly ,otherwise you wont do much dmg with either weapons.
---
This also applies to your traits that enhance your weapons, or playstyle. Using strength to get that 21% increased dmg wont do you much good if you focus on condition dmg and dual swords.
---
Same goes for your bleed on critical hit trait if you focus on greatsword and power/precision.
---
Soulbeast can only use sword in main hand, and a dagger in offhand.
---
Try them all in the PvP lobby and mix and match runes/pvp amulets and try different skill /trait /stat set up and see which is more fun for you :)
---
This is true for the Engineer rocket boots too right? Been a while, forget ..

Good points but correct me if I’m wrong, barrier is affected by agony isn’t it?

Can I bring an entirely new character? Been wanting to level a new one but I'm lazy. Don't want to be a burden on the squad but it'd be neat if I could level while getting the map completion I also need anyway 
---
Teleportation menu for storing tomes and scroll unlocks first
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted for telling the truth. Butthurt white knights 
---
Thanks everyone for the kind words. I wanted to explain that since charr have many different colours and textures of their horns, I like to imagine that a lot of charr have antelope-style horns - that is, the outer layer of their horn is made of keratin, with a bone core connected to the skull. That bone core is what I've drawn for 3 of my charr here, with the exception of Ihri who has so many spikes on her head I think they all must come out of her skull lol.
---
I swear I'm dreaming... **^(rubs eyes)**
---
**^(+1)** And I hope they enjoy the content Gw2 has. &lt;3
---
They are amongst the top tier power dps for Raids.
---
What nonsense. GW2 is an amazing game all by its own. That it shines even more if compared to other, failing games is common sense.
---
Your underhanded bashing by choice of words plus the barely veiled jab of your account name reminds me immensely of our house troll.
---
*When you are to lazy to press Z*

PS. The lfg tool arleady *is* in the menu bar at the left top.
---
About the choice of wvw servers:
---
If you choose a german server most of them should have ok activity during the time you prefer. Though some are more consistent than others. Right now these german servers or german links should have an edge in activity:
---
Kodash(currently full)
---
Abaddon's Mouth &amp;Dzagonur(both medium)
---
Elona Reach&amp;Miller's Sound(very high and medium)
---
Kek. It's like asking anet if there's plans for build templates or plans for an actual, realistic, raid release cadence.
---
*Dies inside*.
---
Lol you asked for criticisms or suggestions 
---
1. Bountiful Maintenance Oil is always preferred
---
2. General Spirit usage is Storm-Sun-Stone for condi groups and GoE-Frost-Stone for power groups. GoE can be broken OP when used by a druid that knows when to use it.
---
3. If you're running a different heal skill to Water Spirit you gotta run quickdraw and actually use a proper quickdraw rotation for wh5.
---
4. To use CA you gotta camp it way more now and isn't just as simple as 4-3-2, it's super important or else you're going to get gaps in might as you did in your video. To which I would add something on to. 
---
5. Please for the love of god practice playing druid on the golem at least once a fortnight, somewhat as you would if you were a dps. If you can't maintain 100% might duration on 25 might solo with damage aura, then don't go into a raid please. I understand that chrono's will help you with boons now, but it's always better to be personally responsible for your own boons, don't depend on a second druid or chronos to do your job for you.
---
Since you can stat swap it to whatever you want, keep whatever you need and salvage the rest.
---
This was as a whole a terrible year for most game developers coming out with really bad games/dlc's/expansion. WoW is bleeding more than other mmos cause it has much bigger playerbase. GW2 mostly stayed with its principles which kept most of the people playing. Still pvp has dropped so much, especially in high-ranked u just see the same people match after match. For me there's no winner for best MMORPG in 2018, its just which game lost less.
---
They do, but often it takes a lot of yelling or a lot of time.  We asked for a salvage all function for years before we got it, but we finally did.  Folks didn't like how many hero points it took to unlock an elite spec when HoT launched, and that got toned down rather quickly.  Once upon a time map specific currencies and keys didn't go in the wallet, but eventually Anet put them in the wallet. 
---
It depends on what the suggestion is, how many others are asking for something similar, and how feasible it is.  There's a fair few of us begging for a return to dungeons, but the coding is so off in established dungeons it isnt feasible for them to get bug fixes or much of any focus.  I honestly think the dev's do look at suggestions and what players want, but we have a lot of good ideas and requests and they're limited on people and time. 
---
Can F2P accounts buy Season 2? If so, those episodes would be great prep for HoT (head start on CT Masteries, lore). 
---
There are Mirage mains you know. : P
---
Please put a little more thought and effort behind your question if you are trying to get an elaborate response.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Anyways, to answer you: [revenant](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Herald_-_Power_Shiro), because it has both of the things you are looking for.
---
Save me kormir!
---
My personal daily routine is: 
---
=
---
- Dailies for the gold (usually I go to WvW for this so I can progress on my reward track and pips as well).
---
- Pact Scout Mapping Supplies run (you can't do this since you need masteries to unlock it, but it's a good use for karma if you ever buy the expansions).
---
- Fractals (with masteries you can get up to 15-20 gold depending on RNG, and ascended drops are nice to have).
---
- Tequatl and Triple Trouble (2 gold from each world boss, plus several champ bags, a chance at unique ascended weapons/armor and since you're F2P, it's also good for doing achievements).
---
Ben has specifically stated that they do not have any intention on making 2v2 queues a permanent thing. It seems that their primary concern is that it will increase queue times too much for conquest since the sPvP population is small.
---
I do believe he stated they intend on bringing various sPvP events back every so often (like 2-3 months), but I don't believe 2v2s would be as frequent as that.
---
Lfg charr hide farm.
---
&gt; I still dont get why you think that all listings of an item, even the high ones, need to be bought on a regular basis in order for the economy to be healthy? The only players negatively affected by those high listings that dont get bought are the ones that listed them in the first place and if they are bothered by their items not selling, they can relist them or not list them for a high price in the first place and sell directly. 
---
I don't know how many ways i can explain it. stock sitting and doing nothing is of benefit to no one. Undercutting is not sustainable, as you will quickly hit the minimum price cap and stock will still build up, at which point it is better to sacrifice the few extra copper from the tp and sell it to a vender, rather than waiting months or years for your stock to be up front.
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Those retailers and factories are either overpaying for their ressources or crafting/selling stuff that nobody wants.  
---
&gt;If you farm your ingredients yourself, you will most likely make a profit on your crafted item because you didnt pay anything for your ressources.  
---
&gt;And again, you are highly exaggerating when you claim that crafting is only good for buffs, exp and asc weapons. I make plenty of profit with crafting outside the markets you mentioned.
---
"crafting/selling stuff that nobody wants" yeh no shit that's what i've been saying this entire time. Because 90% of the stuff you craft is worthless.
---
1. time is a resource and investment on its own
---
2. making a profit or not is not the issue
---
3. You flooding the market with items from another source just increases the bloat
---
I not exaggerating at all, making a profit by selling all the worthless crap you craft is exactly the problem, i seriously doubt more then a tenth of the stuff you craft sells unless your targeting specific markets, in which case your only crafting the 10% of useful stuff.
---
 
---
&gt;The market has competitive bargaining and the lower listings get bought on a regular basis and replaced by new listings, its just the higher listings that stay on the TP for long periods.  
---
&gt;Again, why do you think all the high listings need to be bought in order for the market to be healthy? There is absolutely no need for that.  
---
&gt;And a static NPC vendor is already there, its just the case that for the overwhelminging majority of items, the competitive market on the TP offers the better prices.
---
Actually none of that is true. There is tiny selection of popular items that are bought regularly (mostly materials and super late-game gear).  Stock or funds sitting in storage benefits no one.
---
The static NPCs always have better purchase prices, they are just inconvenient to hunt down and travel to.  point is that the only difference between the static vendors and the tp is that the tp is accessible from anywhere.
---
&gt; No, prices should change based on current market value and they do for most items on a daily, if not hourly basis already. I just wanted to express that sudden price spikes of several hundred percent in times of demand should be avoided, if possible. And high listings at 50%, 100% or 200% of the current market value help countering those price spikes, so I dont see the point you are trying to make when you suggested that old, high listings should be purged from the tp. 
---
prices do not change almost ever. Because we dont have seasonal changes, demands and shortages caused by stock trading fuck ups, companies closing down. A sword isn't suddenly more valuable today than it was in beta, more likely is worth significantly less now as there is far more of it. Lok the graoghs on TP sites, almost every item has just gradually descended in price over the last 6 years or so, with odd fluctuation from a streamer or whale flipping 1000 items in one go etc..
---
 The more listings their are the more people will undercut and that is not sustainable, as the item will eventually just hit minimum price but still wont sell more units than what is being continually added. 
---
&gt;You still failed to make a proper argument that those high listings are the doom of the economy and failed to show proof that, in fact, **everything is worthless due to over supply**, which is what you claimed in your OP.  
---
&gt;It seems that your quarrel is just with a small group of items that are traded mostly around salvage value instead of crafting value.
---
My only argument was that the TP is rather pointless in its current state.  think i made that quite clear. The rest i wasn't sure about, which i also made very clear. 
---
No your only points so far is that the TP is flawless because of the very few items u profit off.
---
&gt; Most players already salvage all trash gear they get from loot by default, so automating it further wont bring much of a change about. Most trash gear would also yield more profit if sold at current lowest listing value compared to the mats you salvage from them. But most players are too lazy to list all that trash gear individually and rather forfeit some profit in exchange for lower opportunity costs of salvaging them all. 
---
you just reworded what i already said...
---
My record for these trains is level 17, you're welcome to try and beat it! Keep in mind that we do hover quite a bit to make sure everyone is able to keep up, but if you have mounts it shouldn't be too hard to stay in the center of the group :\]
---
hah yes definitely needs that as well.
---
It’ll be better to have a quick button to Deposit Material on the Inventory tab than anything else. 
---
The new olmakhan tonic sorta shows it.
---
NA. We're not ready to run fractals yet. I think my wow folks are still involved with 8.1. I'm still trying to lure them over. 😉
---
Aha, there you are, Kei &gt;:D need more wicked charr art around these parts.
---
The problem with your solution is it ignores practically all of the basic laws of supply and demand. The swords are there as nobody. NOBODY wants them. Thus no demand = no sell. Your solution... however disrupts this basic law and will in doubt just f up the economy and make it like WoW.
---
YAY this sounds so exciting...i hope my guild doesnt get angery if im on this events that the daily ones we do :P
---
Steam Controller. You can set all outputs to regular kb+m binds, without losing mouse control for things like inventory management/build swapping.
---
If you already have one, you can pm me sometime tomorrow and I can help you set it up.
---
they arn't made from just iron and flipping is a very common.
---
Crafting is supposed to be to either gear yourself up or make a profit. Ive never seen a game where crafting exists soley for xp farming.
---
I can't decide between Vengeance and Exemplar's edge. . . 
---
What do I do with Winterberries/Petrified Wood/Orrian Pearls/etc. /besides/ ascended trinkets (which I don't need)?
---
Are scholar runes still in demand ?
---
Yes, they are still meta for power builds in PvE. The recipe just doesn't require charged lodestones anymore.
---
Honestly I'd like all the Kralkatorrik stuff to just get mopped up already.
---
I agree with what the devs said before regarding the dragons; it gets boring, fast. There's *so much* other cool shit in-universe, and I'd like to see a lot more of that and a lot less "the dragons are coming!"
---
Plus, Ascended gear is an OPTION for everything (including raids and fractals). The same goes for Legendary Gear.  The only high level gear you will ever really need is Exotic and it's easy to get Exotic bulk armor recipes and Exotic weapons. (To the newbies: In GW2, exotic gear is lower than Ascended gear and Legendary gear.Anything above exotic gear is just for show or bragging rights. The stat changes are negligible.)  :D
---
(Cough) Build Templates (Cough) Cantha (Cough) Playable Tengu race just so we can stop listening to people whine about how much they want to become a bird person. (Cough)
---
Sorry, I need to see a doctor.
---
Depends on what you want to do.
---
In PvE, Guardian and Engineer both have very good burst DPS. Guardian is easier to play than Engi, both of them are meta power DPS builds (Engi also has a pretty solid condi build, Guardian's is pretty mediocre).
---
Warrior has fast-paced rotations as well as viable power and condition builds in PvE, which may also be worth looking into. Ultimately it's hard to give recommendations to you when we don't know what kind of content you want to do.
---
&gt; and train your rotation in the golem training area until you are comfortable with it.
---
he would need  300g tag for that, and as a new player i would not suggest he shell out for that; as an alliterative and only a few loading screens away is the fractal training golem, you cant give yourself boons or the golem debuffs but its the next best thing, or ask around for a ferry into the actual golem room in the raid lobby
---
If anything the base story is better than the expansions since dialogues can be skipped. 
---
Yeah I bought both expansions the second day I played. As of right now I play wvw, PvP, and the story line I'm liking the story so I guess I'll be playing for awhile before I beat the PVE part
---
Yes. Many of us played the game for 3 years before the first expansion came out. You probably won't go that long, but there's plenty of enjoyment to be had. And then when you are ready to spend money, you've already built up your account.
---
hmmm surely they weren't there the whole time.  I figured it would be scaled down but still just map completing 4 mainland maps should give more than 5 levels and the HoT maps are dense and full of way more stuff that gives exp.  Guess I'll just have to see what happens. Maybe I'll pm you afterwards with the results lol
---
"I stopped enjoying it so it must be ded ~~gaem~~ gerne." --/u/Anhvu24
---
Open the dominion. Stop having it be closed.
---
Wait, what? I love Star Trek, STO not only still exists but is in active development? The game has to be ten years old by now?
---
Ooze combat tonic seems like an easy thing to do.
---
I just want Cantha. Fuck everything else.
---
You realize they have given a child a terminal illness that could kill her any moment so this line Anet would kill a child in the story isn't true. 
---
The hell do I know. I do know that a new race would be a breath of fresh air. Now, mind you I said CANTHA as in the location. I don't particular care for the tengu themselves a playable race.  Would I want a new playable race? Hell yeah, of course! A new race adds to the game and is a potential hook for new players.
---
But I just want my Cantha back. I grew very fond of it back in the days of Factions.
---
Basically nothing if you don't want the various collectibles like minis, skins, tonics, etc, or Aurora. Season 3 currencies aren't worth farming if you don't need the accessories. You can turn them into unbound magic and then use that for the loot bundles to dump it, but that is really bad profit and not worth your time.
---
because if the price never changes, how can this be considered a marketplace? why not just make it a static vender store?
---
I never claimed it was game breaking or anything, but it is a rather popular mechanic that hasn't ever worked. Of all the mmos ive played none had this issue, not even Diablo 3.
---
Untrue, you can create a squad at anytime even without commander tag. You simply need to click the party icon on the top left of your screen and click create squad. Then you can enter the golem lobby!
---
No, they raised the wall. Changing the ground would probably involve a wonderful array of additional work in moving spawns, path waypoints, regenerating navmesh, rebaking lighting, and subsequently a lot of wasted time for testing of everything aforementioned for absolutely no value gained.
---
We'll probs kill Kralk in the final episode of LS4 imo. I don't think they'd put 6 episodes in S4 if they were just gonna wrap up Kralk's story in the penultimate episode.
---
Same happened to me. One day I just randomly decided browse LFG and some folks just wanted to run around and level characters.
---
Now we play this and other games together.
---
We all know that is not going to happen though. Also it was just recently revelealed, AFTER all the pieces of the puzzle have been added there (Blish being golem, him having a brother to help with procedure). It would have just been a "cripple" instead that gave enough explanation why Taimi is always hiding inside a golem for fights.
---
interesting indeed
---
because having materials be more expensive than crafted goods makes so much sense?
---
The whole system ignores real life economics, its kind of a moot point. Do the basic rules of supply and demand adress, the issue of unskilled consumers being able to get quality goods by beating up some scrub tier centaurs? Tats like deer in real life dropping cooked meat and and leather jackets.
---
I would fucking hate that. Shattered Observatory is one of the worst fractals imo and I hate running it. Having it take up one of the fractals every three days fucking blows, who knows if Siren's Reef is going to be good or bad - it could also suck to run it once every three days.
---
If you wanna run CMs, run CMs. If you don't have time for three, don't do three. Restricting the daily fractal pool to accommodate CMs would just suck for people who don't care about CMs.
---
Crafting is used for xp farming only cooking to get to lvl 80 as it is the cheapest. However others with craftsman 500 and usually used to gear up ascended or legendary gear. Both used to progress and profit off. Jewellery is the easiest to start making gold with. 
---
I'd disagree about Joko.  Don't quote me on this, but I believe I remember hearing that the developers were going to have him be the sole focus of this Living World season.  They ultimately decided to shorten his role so he wouldn't overstay his welcome.  We could have seen more from him and gotten a proper backstory (aside from what the most recent halloween gave us, which still didn't really expain how he became a lich).  In my opinion, the Joko saga was kinda rushed too, but you disagree.  That's perfectly acceptable.
---
Or even skill 5, but when it does you feel like a control god. skill 4 is savior to the downed esp. if you pair it with tp to enemy utility. Try to align anything related to hammer with quickness on wep. swap 
---
Yeah that's why I really think this will be split into two parts.  If this really is the end of Kralkatorrik, that is.
---
Janthir would be cool. It'd probs have ancient mursaat stuff. And probably a lot of centaurs since they came from the woodland cascades.

and if you are on eu, i can take you on the fractal runs
---
Power rifle Holo with kits is hands down better than any other build for T4s. Despite what people say, it really isn't that difficult to play and I'll explain why.
---
Power Holo is generally seen as "difficult" because the rotation is very fast and requires you to be swapping in and out of kits as well as Photon Forge constantly; basically, to do well on Holo, you have to be able to perform the rotation very quickly and for new or inexperienced players all of the hotbar swapping can look extremely complicated.
---
If you do the rotation properly you can look at your Fire Bomb's cooldown and when it hits a specific point you know that your other skills are ready to be used (Bomb Kit is your filler which is why it's easy to track everything with Fire Bomb). It's rotation is effectively the same loop over and over, although you can modify the rotation for maximum DPS on each encounter but this isn't necessary for casual T4s.
---
Rifle Holo has a very fast rotation but it isn't that complex. Swapping between kits quickly and using the appropriate skills in each kit makes it seem a lot more complicated than it actually is, but once you practice it and start to understand it it's very satisfying and fun to play. You'll have a bit of trouble at first because of your latency but it won't be that bad once you get the hang of it. It's by far my favorite power DPS.
---
Now that's a place I'd like to see.  How awesome would it be to get a map filled with enormous trees like the northwest corner of the Bitterfrost Frontier map?  It could be like Endor from Star Wars.
---
&gt; Ultimately, I don't think we'll ever be told where or when this Siren's Reef takes place, as we never found out where or when Deepstone Fractal took place.
---
This is why I find it hard to give a shit about GW2 lore anymore. Fractals are a disaster of wasted resources and opporunity loss.
---
When making a "dungeon" they have an opportunity to delve deeper into a specific faction of the game's antagonists - Nightmare Court, mordrem, awakened, branded, largos etc. Instead we get what is essentially concept art for what could be lore instead of actual lore. They diverged a little from this with the Twilight Oasis but too often they just do nothing.
---
I would much rather the Deepstone fractal be the culmination of a bunch of lore and stories that take place beneath the ruins in the Desert Highlands mountains instead of similar architecture but no linked story. One of the joys of an MMO with real dungeons is following a quest line and NPC dialogue in an area around a dungeon so you have all this build up to an epic dungeon crawling encounter, followed by a satisfying fight to conclude the adventure (bonus points if there are follow up quests that resolve the plots that climaxed in the dungeon encounters).
---
Fractals are mostly just pretty locations with mechanics.
---
For all the things GW2 does really well, they do dungeons wrong.
---
I want Zojja back.
---
Maybe some day...
---
These are gorgeous! Love Kyrus's the most, but they're all equally stellar! 
---
 Just curious, would you ever consider doing a skull commission, and if so how much would something like that run?
---
Sorry for the delay. I definitely know there are some rare skin drops available and some available through lengthy achievement grinds but many of them require fractals, dungeons, raids, or ascended pieces. 
---
An example of what is fun for me is Warframe and grinding the same kind of mission because you know eventually you’ll get something cool, wow old raids for transmog, path of exile grinding to clear maps faster, etc. 
---
I noticed I racked up a lot of xp by joining a bounty, or hero/mastery points train group. 
---
Yeah for four balls rubbing your face, SURE!
---
I spit my drink.
---
On TC, can confirm. There's one guy you sorta have to block. Everyone else seems fine.
---
Its the sunspear outfit you get when you buy pof deluxe version. 
---
Why not just allow us to make build pages with different equipment installed inside them?
---
Haha. Good shit
---
Way to ruin his fun.
---
I'm a huge sucker for ending things the way they begin.  To defeat Kralkatorrik in the spot where it awoke would be the perfect way the wrap up it's arc. (I also want Primordus to be the final dragon to be defeated because it was the first to rise).  I'll have to zoom in on that area though the next time I play.  I haven't seen the claw marks.
---
&gt; I actually think we will fight kralkatorrik in this episode
---
I'm not on boat about this though. It's too much of a red herring to have this trailer build up about "the big battle" and... have it occur? What happened to death of dragon = end of the world? This would need to be resolved all at once too.
---
Personally, I'm inclined to believe this episode will actually build up for the big finale, the big battle, but I don't think we will actually reach the battle itself. Our plate is already full:
---
- We need to find Aurene
---
- We need to deal with whatever happens at Thunder Keep
---
- We need a plan because as far as we know the last time Aurene vs. Kraky was mentioned she had countless of visions resulting in her death
---
- So we also need to convince Aurene that a battle would be a good idea
---
- And we need to gather everyone for said battle
---
All of this while episodes are known to give us 3-4 story instances at most.
---
So a Kralkaricky♥ battle on top of that? Unlikely.
---
(Take a look)[http://imgur.com/a/tC6n8]
---
[Take a look](http://imgur.com/a/tC6n8)
---
&gt; we have only considered Kralkatorrik to be the PRIMARY antagonist for one going on two episodes. 
---
I don't know, he's been involved in one of Guild Wars 2's book, was the cause of Glint's and Snaff's death, and that's not counting all the tease around him since EotN + the branded mark that has been sitting on our map since launch... A branded mark that *expanded twice* (one by the end of LS3, and another one by the beginning of LS4).
---
I'd say that he has been very much a threat, more than all other Elder Dragons, and got *lots* of exposure. He's the only dragon we've witnessed drastic permanent influences *on our map*. Even Mordremoth didn't reach that level of changes despite waking up very late.
---
While I get your point that it goes down fast, I wouldn't say he wasn't the "primary antagonist" until now. He was always lurking and important.
---
Interesting.  A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. 
---
SoS in general has a pleasant chat, the few discrepancies were our last link that looked like many hate us... (at least I remember on link day literally our link hating the hell out of us and us wishing to get back our usual links)
---
Warning: stay away from Magumma...FA chat is pleasant breeze compared to Mag X_x
---
Whatever you do, avoid Maguuma at all costs. That server is nothing but a plague and everyone on it needs to be removed from the game.
---
To quickly "fix" it on your side you can change map/instance or go to character select and come back. This will mostly be useful for raids LFGs as you're not realistically gonna do that if you LFG for an open world meta event :p
---
You’re wrong then. 
---
And with a shitty reply like yours, I don’t really have to elaborate.
---
So I'm currently using my Thief for the past few months and so I think I'm ready to play a new class. Can someone recommend me a class to play for casual PvE (preferably someone who can dual wield swords)? 
---
That's the reason I could never get into FFXIV - I started it and it was like going back in time 10 years in terms of combat. Standing in place to cast ANYTHING made me crazy. 
---
Minus raids
---
 2:03 you say to use Bountiful Maintenance Oil for boon duration which it does not give 
---
With your gear using a utility that has concentration might be needed for people who are new to the class considering that your current concentration puts boon duration at like 15sec instead of 20sec with full harrier. Honestly if someone is new to druid they should just go full harriers for good healing power and boon duration.
---
 Also, when discussing quickdraw as an option it is important to note the 9sec ICD, leaving CA as quickly as possible seems like a poor recommendation now that Chrono cannot just carry boon duration leading to gaps in might uptime if you are solo druid which is shown by the fact that you only got 25might through axe aa.  
---
I appreciate the effort and regardless of criticisms I have I think this is a decent guide for new druid players it just that like with most guides doing further reading and playing will benefit them the most.
---
Ah, I think that's my problem, I'm one of those people waiting for others to start a group simply because I'm not confident enough to run one myself.
---
In WoW I run groups all the time. Is running a low level Fractal group pretty easy?
---
I approached it the same way I did with WoW: 
---
* Watch a walkthrough - learn what to expect from fight mechanics.
---
* Browse a guide - maybe keep it in another window for quick reference. 
---
* Make sure you have a relevant build that you're comfortable playing, and can play well. 
---
* Also make sure said build is strong for group content, b/c people hate "selfish" builds that offer nothing for the group (boons/utility/support). 
---
* Use LFG, read descriptions. 
---
* When you get in the group, let them know it's your first time but that you've watched the fight, looked up strat (if relevant) and can listen to directions. Unless they're dickheads or speedrunning (in which case they'll usually say 'exp only') they usually won't mind showing you the ropes.
---
* OR Find a guild that enjoys running that content and learn it with them. 
---
Dungeons are pretty straight forward, despite how much more complex they seem than WoW (I didn't have to look up guides for most of them when leveling my mage via group finder), but I don't see many people running them anymore. I could usually follow along and get by via doing what the rest of the group was, unless my class had a special role in the fight (http://gw2dungeons.net/ can help too). Fractals *do* require a little bit more effort. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/716wl5/guide_to_exp_boosting/
---
By pvp. You mean wvw  ?
---
You can play anything in wvw.
---
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't see your comment earlier.  Actually I completely agree with everything you say there.  To tie back to what we were talking about, yeah, I was trying to say that this shouldn't be the end of the Kralkatorrik saga just yet.  Guess we will see what happens.  I like the way you think.
---
Hopefully they kill off Kralk or at least put him to sleep or something so we can focus on other stuff.
---
Exploring a mad god and an undead tyrant kept the game fresh from being just Dragon Hunting w/ Friends.
---
Going right back to Kralk after Joko leaves a rushed feeling but ah well they probably thought might as well clean up kralkatorik while the expansion still focuses on Elona.
---
On the other hand they might make kralk migrate to another region which would be covered in another Expansion.
---
I know that feel - in SWTOR, at *launch* my friend and I were the only people on each planet from Alderaan through Corellia. They've gone from dozens of servers down to like 4 now, but even so - seeing the population count for each planet/map is really sad. 
---
I know WoW has implemented a shared server type thing (at least in cities?) but this is really an area where GW2's megaservers shine. I've rarely, if ever, been on a map for long without seeing someone else. 
---
That said, GW2 does have an LFG tool, it isn't as automated as the one in WoW, but it does exist. Thankfully, there are also reasons to visit various maps throughout the world - even if it's just for dailies. 
---
They always could add killing walls like in HoT - you explore too much so you die. 
---
I haven't played WoW in a long time, so I don't remember how much more advanced its group finder was compared to the GW2 LFG tool. 
---
I like being able to choose which masteries you want to level (aside from a few of the mandatory ones for story progression). 
---
But that's what's nice - grind is out of want, not necessity. 
---
oh well thats fine if only ascended gear+ is useful that makes all the other issues null and void /sarcasm
---
Group Finder is pretty simple. You just tick a box for what you are playing (DPS, Tank, Priest, and if you can be a Guide), and either choose a specific dungeon or Random (XP+gold), and then you just queue. It can be that simple, because WoW's combat *is* simple, especially since the talent system change.
---
GW2 LFG tool isn't exactly complicated, but you can specify your wishes in the 'title'. It's also everything; it's a 'group/squad' finder for all game modes. The key difference is that it isn't random. You don't 'queue' with it.
---
great so a handful of items supposedly fluctuate
---
&gt; The whole system ignores real life economics, its kind of a moot point 
---
I left right before mists, when SWTOR launched. SWTOR wasn't the best game or anything, but having fully animated VO cutscenes made it really hard to go back to reading quests and rollercoaster story (along for the ride). GW2 introduced so many more QoL features, in addition to a fun, vibrant combat system, that going back became almost impossible. I briefly played Legion (I think?) but quickly lost interest, even though I feel demon hunter was a fun class and not as frozen as my typical casters.  
---
Yeah. These items fluctuate due to supply and demand. People want them + lots of supply + patches affect how they fluctuate. Proper economy. You don't see lets say. The price of salt fluctuate heavily IRL or people massively buying up Kilos of salt as an investment. Same applies in gw2. Being cynical when you yourself fail to think a little eh... is a issue.
---
Hahahaha if this happens...  ok, I'm not expecting this at all.  The first part sounds plausible though, maybe we will force this thing out of the mists?
---
Its a game. What do you expect. A fully simulated economics in a game? Wrong game then. Go play stock market simulator 2019 or smthing.
---
I saw a lot of people fall away at launch because it's just a different game, and if they can't adjust expectations to understand that it isn't the same game structure (whether regarding leveling or end-game), they wind up not knowing what to do with themselves. 
---
Honestly I get that, it's an easy thing to think.
---
Running t1 fractals is really easy, don't think of it as running a group at all really. There is a 100% chance in this stage of the games life if you make a fractal group there'll be somebody who knows every mechanic and will start typing you if you ask/get stuck. I've never had any issues. If you've played WoW you can work out the mechanics, and the the content isn't so hard you can't wing it.
---
Worst case you wipe once or twice and learn, just go for it! (No gold for repairing gear in GW either)
---
If you don't mind stationary skills. 
---
Are there actually any MMOs where you can somewhat "strafe" around enemies' auto-attacks? in GW2, outside of LoS, you'd still get hit if you step aside from an mob's incoming arrow (unless it's a special attack à la Bristleback's rapid fire thingy?), and I think to remember from BnS that circling around enemies didn't help against their auto attacks (too much) either, "only" against AoE. I always though those MMOs didn't allow it as it would probably trivialize too much (or be a pita from a programming point of view).
---
Gee. If only i mentioned a crafting discipline that allowed you to make gold from people having a demand for a certain item. O the horror. 
---
Sarcasm aside. Ascended armour is ONE of the uses.
---
Crafting mats for legionaries / exotics/rare items for profit also exists. Ascended was used as an example as its a easy end goal to get to.
---
Plus it's not like you'll make lvl 10 gear and use it on your lvl 80 chars.
---
Yeah, I'm having trouble with step 5, using LFG. In WoW you just hit the queue, but in reply to my comment I've found that my best bet is to create a group myself. 
---
&gt; I don't know how many ways i can explain it. stock sitting and doing nothing is of benefit to no one. Undercutting is not sustainable, as you will quickly hit the minimum price cap and stock will still build up, at which point it is better to sacrifice the few extra copper from the tp and sell it to a vender, rather than waiting months or years for your stock to be up front.
---
I dont know how many times i have to state that these high listings protect the item from price spikes, which ensures a more balanced market and therefore benefits everybody. And if there arent any price spikes, these hgih listings dont harm anybody besides the players who listed them, so why is there a need to take them down by force?
---
&gt; I not exaggerating at all, making a profit by selling all the worthless crap you craft is exactly the problem, i seriously doubt more then a tenth of the stuff you craft sells unless your targeting specific markets, in which case your only crafting the 10% of useful stuff.
---
Thats the beauty of a player and profit driven market because its your own choice of what to craft and what not. I dont know why you think that crafting 1000 blue swords that nobody wants should earn you profit.
---
&gt; Actually none of that is true. There is tiny selection of popular items that are bought regularly (mostly materials and super late-game gear). Stock or funds sitting in storage benefits no one.
---
In the last 90 days, [I sold over 900 different items](https://imgur.com/a/v1swXoF) with a total volume of over half a mllion for over 200k gold. Around 100k gold in sales came from crafted runes and sigils alone, so dont try to lecture me on what sells on the tp and what doesnt.
---
And if you claim that stocks or funds sitting in players inventories benefit no one, why are you so eager to return high listings that havent been sold for a while to their respective owners? You are contradicting yourself.
---
&gt; The static NPCs always have better purchase prices, they are just inconvenient to hunt down and travel to. point is that the only difference between the static vendors and the tp is that the tp is accessible from anywhere.
---
I was talking about sales prices and the vendors only give you vendor value, which is in most cases, way less than what is offered on the tp, even for precise iron swords.
---
&gt; prices do not change almost ever. Because we dont have seasonal changes, demands and shortages caused by stock trading fuck ups, companies closing down. A sword isn't suddenly more valuable today than it was in beta, more likely is worth significantly less now as there is far more of it. Lok the graoghs on TP sites, almost every item has just gradually descended in price over the last 6 years or so, with odd fluctuation from a streamer or whale flipping 1000 items in one go etc..
---
Prices dont change? No seasonal changes or trading fuck ups? Maybe heed your own advice and have a look at TP sites, for example this [rare lvl 35 trident](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/item/46005-Hunters-Bandit-Trident).
---
Look up any rune of sigil and you will see plenty of seasonal changes since the update on nov 13th.
---
&gt; The more listings their are the more people will undercut and that is not sustainable, as the item will eventually just hit minimum price but still wont sell more units than what is being continually added.
---
Anything to back this up? Because i surely dont decide if I undercut the lowest listing or list my item at a higher value based on the amount of listings in total of that item. The fact that there are over 100k mithril ore listed for more than 10s has absolutely no impact on my decision process when listing mithril ore. Even if they are removed, it wont encourage me to list at higher prices.
---
&gt; My only argument was that the TP is rather pointless in its current state. think i made that quite clear. The rest i wasn't sure about, which i also made very clear.
---
Your argument was that high listings that havent been sold in a while a damaging the economy to a degree that it is failing and you failed to back that up.
---
I want the saaaame ! 
---
Mglrmglr
---
I have the bad feeling they could fuse Taimi and Zojja into 'one' sooner or later. Taimi's physical condition isn't getting better, and Zojja... well it seems her mental condition isn't also getting better.
---
I just want to kill Kralkatorrik already so that GW2 can finish its plot before GW3 releases.
---
The newest ones are mostly gold gated, rather than significantly time or event process gated.
---
&gt;we have only considered Kralkatorrik to be the PRIMARY antagonist for one going on two episodes.
---
Kralkatorrk's influence was present all throughout PoF.
---
Him attacking Amnoon and flying south is the reason why we went to Istan in the first place. There was even a Branded Wyvern in Ep2. Joko was just a side quest. Kralkatorrik was the real threat of LS4.
---
The PoF stuff is longer maps, and you need 400 elegy mosaics which is much more difficult to get than the equivalent crystalline ore. You need trade contracts instead of airship bits, let fragments and aurilloum too, which I think are easier to get.
---
Also the funerary incense stuff is gated too which is a pain.
---
Just wondering, why do you open them on a lower level char
---
Hard luck. It's sewing supplies.
---
\[Offtopic\] 
---
This is so extremely annoying to see people telling others when to raid and when to not. The only raid requirement is knowledge of mechanics and decent build. Only several bosses have dps check, most just require you to not die. Practicing on golem is not what is required for raids, as well as maintaining 25 might is not required. Don't generalize requirements for experienced groups (250+ LI, I suppose, cause lower most druids maintain might suboptimal way) for everybody.
---
I'm not saying that people should ignore practicing on golem - no, it is very good to optimize and to get used to rotation. But we should keep in mind that most people from lfg raiding (and, my guess, most of raiders) are not going to spend their time in game on golem - it's not fun for most. 
---
\[Offtopic\]
---
Eh, GW1 coastal kryta was really similar and still not really cool.
---
You can use PvP to unlock all of the Aurora skins and it counts towards the progress. That was the only way I was able to do it because forget doing all of the "Master of \_\_\_\_\_" achievements.
---
1. The best advice I can give is to do the Ember Bay JP Last when finishing all of the regional masteries before unlocking Awakening. Go with a friend who has a mesmer, and take a position rewinder for yourself. That way you can just glide down from the end of the JP to do each checkpoint a second time for the awakening achievement.
---
2. Start the Draconis Mons backpack early because it will take forever to do.
---
3. Start gathering Blood Rubies from the moment you decide to go for Aurora.
---
4. Use [Gw2timer.com](https://Gw2timer.com) to manage spawns of champions and events for the achievements you're looking to do. It will save you a lot of otherwise wasted waiting time.
---
But what makes CMs so good are the bossfights. Trash isn't and will never be engaging or challenging.
---
I forgot that you **have** to do every available CM + t4 daily. 
---
Sarcasm aside they don't have to do shit. If you have the time, do it. If not, you literally lose out on a fraction of a fraction of rewards, who cares.
---
or they could have 98-99-100 (assuming nightmare, observatory and unlikely this) have it's weekly rotations which would result in nightmare-observatory, nightmare-this, observatory-this over three weeks of cms)
---
I was using GW2Hook until now and everything was fine, but since a few weeks somehow my GW2 is extremeley laggy and buggy (literally a slideshow with constant 5-10sec freezes and regularly crashes; i noticed in task-manager, that it, and is crashing , so I'm just setting up a fresh windows installation (which I wanted to do anyway) and get a fresh GW2 installation aswell.
---
Maybe I would just try reshade4.0. 
---
Do you think Hook caused this trouble with a new gw2 update?
---
(Is there any guide to get this "tricky" reshade4.0 working for gw2?
---
"The only raid requirement is knowledge of mechanics and decent build."
---
Wrong! There is only one requirement.
---
That is personable accountability. 
---
For example if you say you're a dps then you are accountable to expectations you have placed on yourself. That statistical measure of personal accountability can be found in the Area Stats on ArcDPS. By inference if you die a lot, you will ofc have bad dps, if you screw up mechanics then you will ofc have bad dps.
---
If you say you're there to give boons and heal then you will be held personally accountable to that. That statistical measure of personal accountability can be found in the Outgoing Boons on ArcDPS. Also by inference if you die a lot, you will ofc have bad boons, if you screw up mechanics then you will ofc have bad boons. And if you have bad boons then ofc your squad will have bad dps, bad healing per second and bad survivability.
---
I only know enough about warr and mesmer, but here it goes:
---
Warrior: 
---
Pros: easy to understand and play decently from the get-go, unique buffs for end-game content that will guarantee you a spot anywhere (banners and empower allies), great cleave and cc.
---
Cons: not the best dps out there, dual wielding swords isn't particularly optimal (but very much viable in open world), doesn't have all that many utilities besides buffing damage and single target cc.
---
Mesmer:
---
Pros: versatile class that can be built around pdps, cdps and support (dual swords are mainly power only), high skill cap with rewarding gameplay once you get to know the ins and outs of the class, has the most and most varied amount of available utilities in the game, great survivability and good cc.
---
Cons: it takes a bit more than the average of the player's time investment to understand how it works and start performing decently.
---
Well i want the feeling of accomplishment. Completing some achievment collection feels really good but rewards arent so good as raiding and late game achievements. And I would love to unlock some armors and weapons for fashion :)
---
GW2 doesn't need an easy mode, it's easy mode all around already.
---
Only thing that actually bothers me in the current raid comm, is the ridiculous LI amounts that most groups want. 
---
200+ Dhuum, sure. 200+ Escort? Yeah, no.
---
This is the gatekeeper for new players imo. You can fix rotations, dps, food etc by yourself, but you can only get into some groups (even with training groups it takes months and months to build up that amount of LI) without faking LI, which in turn is looked down upon. 
---
If I don't know what to do right now, I often go through LFG and if I see something interesting, I join. It is every day something different, be it world boss, HoT meta, some fractal, raid training run, whatever. It keeps the game fresh, every day is different, and not boring. And it is good mix with your own long term goals.
---
I think Aurene will either die and fight Kralkatorrik in the Mists, or she will get branded and we will need to save her in a simillar way the Forgotten purified her mother, Glint.
---
Not that unexpected. They prepared us for this by Aurene's vision. Now they will either have us prevent that prophecy, or...
---
"long" dude those are barely a minute each.
---
It was a bug? I thought it was a nerf
---
If I remember correctly, rabid gear usually is better than rampager for budget condi builds, since it has condi damage as main stat. Furthermore, assassin and magi stats aren't available for fractal trinket drops. In the end, berserker trinkets are pretty much the only stuff worth keeping.
---
i am subscirebed there too, but if you look there arent posted any of his videos/streams there. Plus He never post his videos on reddit by himself as far as I know about. And they are both good and nice to talk about for veterans and something itnesrting to watch for new people.
---
Playing through the story chronologically will get you up to speed on some of the new elements (specialisations, gliding, masteries, etc), and will obviously help you get to grips with the context of the maps.   
---
As for Alt-itis I would really urge you to stick with one and go through it all, rather than burn out be going over and over the same content. My first character back in 2012 (and my main to this day) was a thief and I've always loved the gameplay, so I lucked out with that. Once you're done you'll have a more complete idea of what the game is, and all the things you've unlocked will carry over to your alts :)  
---
Good luck, and welcome back!
---
Wait.... I have to buy another expansion?!! Lol 
---
But then again, open world is easy as hell, everything is viable.
---
Assuming the average player spends some time in open world and some time in fractals, he should then craft/sigil a weapon just for the lulz, that's useless under pressure ? That he couldn't and shouldn't truly master in difficult content ?
---
That's hilarious!
---
wait, serious question, are taimi and blish really considered kids? I thought everyone in our team are adults, at least young adults D: 
---
Setting legendary goals could be a thing for you then.
---
True. Even apart from ANet's apparent unwillingness to make longbow at least a decent weapon, I wouldn't expect it to ever become competitive to the current meta weapons. 1200 range and being more area-focused than scepter will most likely prevent that from happening.
---
Yeah that's true, they would repeat too much. Your solution sounds interesting, but maybe it would be too rewarding? I think right now CMs have good and balanced rewards
---
Now all that's left is 3D printing it :) 
---
Eh, many legendary weapons dont "fit" with all professions
---
 its like saying bifrost and nevermore arent fitted for a sneaky thief /daredevil
---
Unfortunately we cant have 1 legendary for each profession and their elite specs, which would be very nice, tho we do have those ascendant achievement weapons for each elite spec
---
I think Taimi will absorb kralkatorik so she wouldn't die.
---
Gw2 players like having their ego stroked.
---
When u put window mode, "click on the bottom from the gw2 window" and leave it, just like if you were about to "re-size" it, it will move automatically the window so you can see the top and move it etc etc.
---
That's the most "window maximized" approach you will get. Nowadays most people just use "Windowed fullscreen", which is waaaaaaaaaaaay better, but well...
---
Do daily T4 + recs fractals are good to begin, then with a full ascended gear, you will probably be able to start raiding with a guild.
---
You're absolutely missing his point and putting words in his mouth he hasn't used. 
---
He's not in anyway suggesting that the LB is not suited for warrior or ranger, just that this bow seems to be inspired for the DH. Therefore he hopes DH gets some PvE balance love as well, since there aren't many incentives atm to use the LB on a DH in PvE.
---
&gt; Windowed fullscreen
---
To be fair. There is two classes that use staves as a blunt weapon. Some less magical skins wouldn't hurt.
---
&gt;failure
---
&gt;I spent many months playing BFA with my friends;
---
Hmm.
---
Fullscreen Windowed is exactly that, maximized window. If you maximize a window it quite literally becomes a fullscreen window. 
---
The taskbar is never shown in fullscreen window unless it’s bugged. Fullscreen window in any modern game works this way.
---
So, if you want to do fullscreen window WITH taskbar, no, that isn’t possible.
---
If you want a window that you can move around and still see the taskbar with, that us what Window mode is for.
---
Yes, exactly.  Don't look for a more complicated method :)
---
Very good summary. One addition still: of these three classes, engi/holo is the most "flashy" one when in the holo forge.
---
Be the change you want to see in others. Post them there.
---
Also, if you want to play a dps class make sure you make a power dps class first (in this case, power chrono). The thing with condi vs power is that condi does more dmg in fights without phases as a rule of thumh, whereas power pulls ahead in short burst fights. This means that condi is pretty bad for fractals. Power dps can always be used on condi bosses (though its not as good as condi, especially twin largos lul), but running a condi class on slothasor or samarog will result in very low dps because they remove all conditions when they phase.
---
Haha fair enough, I'm EU anyway. Good luck with the luring, try candy!
---
Next time just say "no, not possible" then.
---
I guess it's my old archaic version of expecting answers.
---
Lovely good luck in the future and welcome.
---
Also avoid raids they are a toxic place
---
Just move to Europe.
---
Thread removed: For finding/advertising a guild, please use /r/guildrecruitment
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
that is what I thought too when I read the title lmao
---
No it's not that strict. You only need to do about 60%-70% of your class's maximum dps while complying with all mechanics and the raid bosses will go pretty smoothly. Only very few groups are 'that' strict.
---
I think there are a few Chrono Fractal ones, since they are the more popular class for Fractals and raids.
---
I don't especially know any specific video, but I do recommend watching videos of general guides and mechanics for Fractals, along with instabilities and how to deal with them.
---
It is highly advised to watch at least a few Fractal guide videos so that yu don't inconvinence yur party, or at the very least, understand how each instance works and how to play to yur capacity.
---
[This is one of many guides available out there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPf4Pjqzlns)
---
Omg another SEA player in the EU servers! Always nice to know we exist :)
---
Thanks man. I really like your routine and myb I will copy it a bit :). When you said fractals give 15-20g without masteries are those only T4 or can I do T1/T2?
---
Thank you, I will check them home :)
---
T4, unfortunately. T1/2 will still give some gold but far less, although it's still worth doing since they're quite easy.
---
As long as all items are of same weight/race, there should be no problem enabling this. And as said in op those are only outfits, no transmog involved.
---
"Knock Knock. It's the Black Legion. With Huge boats. Full of Guns."
---
DPS in gw2 is actually pretty fun. The combat system is really amazing in that it let you control your characters very precisely on the battle field if you had enough practice. 
---
Some people will say gw2 raiding is easy. What they don't realize is that the fights seem easy because it is done by very good players in a game where high skill tiered game play in pve is possible. If you migrate the 'hard' Raids and dungeons from WoW to GW2 while retaining all gw2 features, I bet you those 'hard' raids will suddenly look really easy. Part of the reason some WoW raids seem harder is because the combat in WoW is more clumsy.
---
I just entered randomly some guild, I don't think I would be able to do similiar stuff like you. But definetly adding on my to-do list when I get familiar with everybody.
---
Well he's guy with casual player's skill level who refuses to be blocked by skill barrier to be able to see and do various content. Do you really find it surprising that he doesn't care that his skill is "not good enough"?
---
You should be able to enter the guild hall and mine etc from nodes if the guild has them. Go have a look! :D
---
One u get hot you can also buy (free) 24 hour boosters, per char from a vendor in tavern
---
Nice, it will finally be farm-able for warriors again.
---
The almost insta killing necro and DH traps alongside shitloads of engi turrets just makes it impossible
---
Is there any way to tell if a character is just an 80 "trial boost" or a if the boost was actually used on a character?
---
When I logged in a while ago I had 2x level 80 boosts. I used one on an Engineer and for the other I have a level 80 Revenant but I don't remember if I actually confirmed the boost on the Revenant because he's still in the lvl 80 boost trial area.
---
Is there a way to be sure because I think i'd rather boost a different class if so.
---
PLEASE, stop creating topics with just a link! You can do better than this....  
---
You could give us an overview, or highlight Devs comments.  
---
The living world timeline supposedly uses real life time
---
*Click start episode*
---
Braham: Commander, it's time, we're waiting for you in Rata Sum.
---
You go there, sad music starts, episode opens with Taimi's funeral, as she only had a few months left to live.
---
&gt; Longbow for DH in open world PvE is great weapon
---
By great you mean terrible. It has nothing to offer. No mass tagging, no burst, no fun. Even hammer is better. Even warrior rifle is better. Maybe they can copy some of ow-hanzo abilities, change the way this weapon works completely, buff that charges up the 5th ability.
---
That just sounds like HoT in a nutshell.
---
A very existential, "You are, therefore you die."
---
Gunboats.
---
I chose the wrong server when joining the game, I do have a free once since I bought the expansions but I don't wanna use that as I've only just started a few hours ago, will deleting my characters and moving servers delete my two Level 80 boosts?
---
I am new in this and EU. So do not know what to expect :)
---
Only a NA pleb would say that!
---
Just as a friendly advice from another artist, avoiding drawing hards isn't good, you need to do it to practice, even if you think they look bad. Hiding them stands out and doesn't look good.
---
Eh that's just silly, it's kind of a meme now to hate and pretend that druid is completely useless in healing. ""why would you ever take a second druid, just run some other healer that is SOOOOOOO much better"". From 2 druid meta it's gone full swing to druid is useless healer. Which obviously is not true.
---
Druid still has great healing, great CC, lets not forget Spotter and GoE and the flexibility on Spirits. 
---
If you want 2 healers, it doesn't instantly mean you require a Scourge healer ressing the whole team every 30 seconds because everyone is face tanking every single thing. There is a scale in where a druid brings enough healing and wins on utility.
---
I have druid, tempest, scourge, renegade and FB (which i havent tried as healer) healing builds. Different builds excell in different encounters
---
Why are you considering a server transfer if you are only level 5?
---
I had forgotten that DH could use LB
---
Playing WvW gives you whole tome for every WvW rank gained though. Fastest way to hoard tens if not hundreds of tomes.
---
Tough titties bro
---
Rephrasing for clarity:  The only backpacks that can be set for Harrier stats all come from collections (WvW legendary, PVP legendary, Fractal legendary, 4x PoF, 1x LWS4e2, 1x LWS4e3).  [Outside of raids](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_back_item#Back_items_with_selectable_prefixes), There are presently no backpacks with harrier stats that can be purchased with currency.
---
By comparison, if you want HoT stats there are nine different backpacks available from vendors in LWS3, plus several from collections in LWS3 and HoT.
---
I wish there were some sort of "tricky, but not pull-your-hair-out hard" solo content, since at this point I'm largely in the demographic you describe as "not many" simply because I never have settled in with a steady group to do fractals or raids with.
---
Granted, from what is being said, longbow still wouldn't be a great choice, but I'd still like that solo content, even if just to create a demand for builds optimized with self-sufficiency in mind.
---
Those are tied to your account and not your home server, I believe. I've changed servers with mine intact.
---
I don't get the Please Don't Die. Is this meant to be glass cannon ?
---
Not that want to defend the bot behaviour in pvp, i hope those guys get banned soon enough but in my opinion, Istan as a farm map has quite a bigger impact on the economy that the pvp botting, simply because so much more players are participating in the istan farm. They may not make as much as the pvp bots/cheaters but accumulated, they produce way more wealth and the main loot they receive (unid gear and VM for trophy shipments) feeds into the main supply of some of the most traded and used crafting materials.
---
People often laugh at me when they find out I'm ventari herald. I'm enjoying this spec so much. Additionaly enemies often expect me to be power herald, but I bring them a little surprise lol, my team is becoming immortal. 
---
I think this spec is very underestimated. With ventari I personally can carry the fight better than with any other prof/spec.  Usualy I can do 100-150k healing just in one teamfight + I bring boons and some CC.
---
The only downside is lack of fast revive due to nerfed (actually completely changed) trait.
---
yup. lucky for me I have alt accounts. 
---
Eh, I didn't see the comment, but I realize that a generic "thanks for being nice" post isn't exactly top notch content and assume you've seen it a thousand times, so I won't fault anyone for rolling their eyes. 
---
Don't do Renegade you'll get nothing done
---
Heh.. well that's definitively where Thunderhead Keep is in Tyria so.. not unlikely that it's related.
---
Well if this is the third this week, then it is an odd post.
---
... I'll see myself out.
---
nah, all servers are salty/toxic to some degree
---
Some of the nicest people I have met in-game are raiders. But sure, generalize an entire subsection of the community, what you just did there isn't toxic whatsoever.
---
You forget about power holosmith? 
---
Thanks! It's Marjory's Shrouded outfit. Quite liked the heavy armor bits themselves without the hood.
---
elite specs only, and we are probably at the limit already.
---
rather not - at least not playable. 3x3 selection grid is full and races are based on GW1 (and some new). introducing a new one would raise questions about why now and why in the first place.
---
Ok, so basically your only point is that istan farming has an affect on the economy (and presumably you'd like something to be done about it).
---
Why bother replying to my post about bots if you're going to dismiss the scope of the problem immediately? You've already started with the assumption Istan farm affects the economy more. Bleh
---
Thanks!
---
I do realize that to most people's eyes this isa generic "thanks for being nice, stranger" kind of post, so I won't judge anyone for rolling their eyes. Just don't go out of your way to make negative comments :p
---
Gift of battle takes 4 hours at T6 participation w/boosters. Only a bit longer without them. 
---
it only goes in shared slot, nowhere else.
---
Wasn't avoiding it. The hands were resembling fists from the gripping and I couldn't see much of the fingers. Since the costume was already dark, what little I could see from the fingers became awkward looking highlights which detracted from the rest of the painting. Had to remove them.
---
Dad, you're embarrassing me in front of my new cool friends!
---
probably wvw friends 
---
I'm just happy to have people like you reading the forums and relaying information so I don't have to go there myself.
---
Scribbling all over the walls?
---
That's a paddlin'.
---
You will not loose the boost, but probably will loose the free transfer anyway.
---
Unlikely. The whole debacle on races has been repeated a thousand times over.
---
Functionally we don't NEED new professions , due to the nature of Elite Specs. Elite specs will eventually expand each profession to cover basically everything possible, so other than aesthetics, it isn't necessary.
---
I am a bizarre refuge from BFA. I played WoW at launch for like 2 months and then Wotlk, Legion for like a month each and 3-4 months of WoD (some time in to it). I've gone back and done a decent amount of old content as I generally like the WC universe. I have never stuck with WoW despite playing MMOs since 1999. Yet I randomly got BFA a few days after launch, paid sub etc. Played maybe a week and quit based on some passing comment about GW2 I saw and returned after 6 years. I'm not even sure I hit the wall of what most people hated about BFA(was nearing cap, finished a bunch of zones) and still just dropped it cold after spending $70 or whatever on it. 
---
Just hide the post then problem solved people want to do this they can if you don't like it there are options to not see the post use them.
---
A reputation system is really the last thing I want for this game. With mount skins as rewards or unique weapon skins. Kind of like Nightfall.
---
For me, it's the combat. I used to log on to wow and love playing my shaman and priest, but in bfa, that all changed. My shaman was a process machine. I was just waiting for something to light up and then press it.
---
On the other hand, Mesmers have so many cool builds and exciting ways to play them. Elementalist and warriors are the other two I have played and TBH, I haven't even looked at the other classes but am excited to try them.
---
Also, mounts are amazung
---
I mean, sort of? Demand for chrono is unparalleled. Druid is commonly needed but nowhere near chrono. 
---
Sure. As for racial armor, [Tixx](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Toymaker_Tixx) is wearing [Human T1 Light shoulders and pants](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Human_cultural_armor/Light).
---
As for different armor weight skins there is [this guy](https://i.imgur.com/HfEpps7.jpg) in Elon Riverlands. He's wearing medium gloves, shoulders and headpiece with light chest and pants and even [this guy](https://i.imgur.com/PUUdL6n.jpg) wearing a monk outfit and a daredevil scarf.

submitted just now by PeppermintBoi
---
Hello :)
---
I am currently playing a Mesmer and am having trouble finding the right gear / build for it.
---
I want to do Fractals which means I will have to play a support Chrono but need some guidance how a good Chrono build looks like.
---
Is Mirage in Open World and WvW suitable? if yes with which build?
---
Indeed, been waiting for that change for &lt;infinity&gt; now
---
You can add me as well :D just message me, i don't have an access to the nametag at the moment - _-
---
And if you never share anything, of course you'll never change anyone's mind. If you do nothing, you get nothing.

---
Small guilds and public WvW raids (specially roaming) are a good way to talk in teamspeak to real people.
---
Man, i complete this map days ago and use springer to get to this door.
---
Is where the destroyers mobs stay.
---
You could get like 10 champs before, yes? I wonder how many you get now, because I am pretty sure it won't be same.
---
The developers do not work for you or me; they work for ArenaNet, and they are in no way required to justify anything they do or say to us, the players. If they do, that's a bonus for us. If they don't, we have to just deal with that like adults. We play in their sandbox, not the other way around.
---
Have you ever seen Gaile on youtube or witnessed her bahaviour on the forums? She is literally the Annie Wilkes of GW2. SHe get's off on extreme moderation, correcting people, always ignoring legitimate criticism of the game and is generally a negative force for the game. She must be due retirement and that's why she hangs on. Can't wait for the day she fucks off tbh.
---
Why did they nerf longbow in the first place? I think it was to do with PvP but they nerfed it in PvE as well?
---
Yes.
---
Okay late in the game question...
---
What happend to belinda? I mean she goes into the sword and then...?
---
Thanks for letting me know. I would have missed that completely and then wondered what people were talking about that I never saw. 
---
Most people agree that leveling as a Mesmer and Revenant is more painful that other classes if that's what you're asking. But it gets better as you unlock more hero points.
---
Istan farming and PvP botting both affect the economy. 4000 gold/month for a pvp-abuse account is 133g/day/account. A full squad in Istan makes that much every 8 minutes. Do you expect there are enough accounts participating in those pvp exploits to be anywhere near comparable to the gold entering the economy via Istan? I'd like to understand your argument that it is a "bigger problem for the economy?"
---
I see pvp farming exploits as a big problem, I just don't agree that its a bigger problem than Istan. Would you mind explaining your view to try to change my mind?
---
Yeah I heard about the engineer thing and also that flanekissed outfit is amazing wtf! Why did they remove it 
---
Hit me up if you have questions later on or anything!
---
Best advice: play the game like you have never seen it before in your life. Explore, get your bearings, take your time. It will definitely be confusing but as long as you don't try to tackle it all at once, you should be fine.
---
you just answered your own question. 
---
&gt; DH [...] don't really have a use for Longbow ~~in PvE~~
---
ftfy. That being said, Guardians don't really have a use for DH outside of PvE.
---
They actually add a few general explanations of the changes they made, like 
---
&gt; "In this update, there have been some modifications to tempest overloads to allow for 10-target applications of select boons. We've also made some quality-of-life changes for the scepter weapon. Most of the instant-damage traits have been standardized so that they do not critically hit, but Electric Discharge will retain its full damage capability when it critically hits a foe."
---
Explanations are almost always about the general intention of the changes.  
---
I've seen a lot of update notes from many games, and hardly anyone ever makes explanations for every change in every skill, with a very few exceptions, like when a skill is reworked into a completely different skill. 
---
Bad whiny players who get used to their gimmicky builds and can't or won't adapt to the changes just choose to ignore those explanations and keep asking "WHY?" in an assortment of very uncreative obnoxious way, right after an update, without bothering with testing the changes.  
---
If they weren't as thick as two short planks, they would instead try to give feedback after trying to make new builds after the changes.  
---
I said since day one, there were no mega servers at that time.
---
Yup. Don't worry too much about getting the correct mix of Berserker/Assassin stats. You can get pure Berserker armor, pure Berserker weapons, and get whatever Assassin pieces you can get on the trinkets (6x Assassin's trinkets might be hard to get, depending on what you have access to)
---
It is worth playing it. You will not enjoy the expansions and content add-ons, but you can still equip to max gear and enjoy it while preparing yourself for when you are ready to spend it.
---
The most annoying thing of doing base content without the expansions is watching people around you who have access to mounts and gliders be able to skip or fast-track a lot of the obstacles you will encounter in the base game, but apart from that, you won't miss what you don't know and the base game is still enjoyable.
---
Men can be goddesses too, you know?
---
Haha i guess so. Just wanted to be sure of it since i dont rlly know alot about pc’s
---
I'd advise to get into the raiding or fractal guild. Eventually I got tired of doing open world stuff with randoms, but I never got tired of doing weekly raid clears and regular fractal full runs with friends. The game is just a motive to get together, talk, have some fun. Basically the social aspect of mmo stands above everything else (imho). With that you'll also get an environment where you can grow, get an experience from others or share yours. DPS race with friends can be a strong motive to improve %)
---
Pretty awesome stuff there. I'm sure Ihri's could be keratin as well, in general all bone protuberances have a cover of some sort, the bones are never exposed directly (except teeth, but they're safe inside the mouth).
---
Many charr seem to cut their horns, so they're probably boneless, which means they're antlers instead of horns. Or maybe something in between, it's fantasy after all.
---
As far as I know, horn bone doesn't grow back, but I'm no biology expert so there could be exceptions.
---
Please try doing asura, sylvari, and tengu too, really love anatomy studies on fantasy races :D.
---
Yeah, exactly. Given the situation we're in, we really don't have an alternative beyond Aurene. Vlast dying was the "oh shit" moment, but killing Aurene would only make us backtrack, and that would cause a lot of frustration and boredom among players.
---
If I change the product of my customers, even if it’s a new button in their interface, I’m getting calls. They say “Hey uh I see this new button, why’d you put that in there. We didn’t define that in the project”
---
It usually ends with me saying it’s a QoL feature and they say “oh nice thank you” and that’s it.
---
Point is, customers have paid and they deserve at least some information why their product changed. Yup Anets devs give information but for some customers aren’t satisfied with the level of information. This is when you’d sit together with your customer and say “alright to keep up a good business let’s talk about what you would like to know vs what we can tell you”
---
Ranger and Mesmer fits that bill. Druids can support, Soulbeasts dps. Chronos can support or dps. Mirages are excellent condition dps. Chronos can tank on the few raid instances where there are tank aggro mechanics.
---
Yes, I think developers should justify their decisions, especially when they change stuff without rhyme and reason and end up affecting the gameplay in unintended ways, or straight up evoking changes opposite to what they were trying to address.
---
But they won't because then it would become obvious they don't play their own game and balancing is done via dartboard, and some anet employees are not fit for their job responsibilities.
---
Everything is presented in order on your story journal under the H menu.
---
So more likely you would have gone to start it and it wouldn't wor!
---
So take away from this: Always log in to GW2 once every 3 months even if you aren't actively playing.
---
So will the Assasin / Berserker Mix be swapped once Deviner comes out ? or is this just for support Chrono?
---
Actually it will take a pretty chunk of time to explain ALL balance changes and have x amount of people pushing their own alternatives and expect the devs to single all of them out, read all of them, explain to the players why this will or will not work, then handle the next idiot who then suggests another alternative to the alternative suggested prior.
---
If Anet has a balance team the size of a Telemarketing company which are paid by the hour to handle every single balance question, then by all means it's possible.
---
I assure yu they do not have this kind of manpower, nor will they ever invest in gathering this kind of manpower for something like this.
---
I can understand how this might have ticked some devs off if people DEMAND it as if it's a right for them to know.
---
There's not really a guide but what you essentially do is:
---
Run installer
---
Point the installer to th gw2 exe / gw2-64 exe in programs folder
---
Navigate to the programs folder and move the 3 added files in to your bin / bin64 folder 
---
When installer finishes don't exit it 
---
Second window will pop up with 4 file locations. Click on the first one and navigate to the default.ini file / reshade.ini 
---
Launch gw2 
---
Press the home key on your keyboard (if you are on laptop and don't have a home key press fn+left arrow key) 
---
Reshade will open and navigate to the settings tab. Select the file locations for /textures and /shaders and relaunch gw2 then you press home key to relaunch reshade and you should be able to follow the tutorial and complete it 
---
I have the same exact cpu.
---
If you turn on a hardware monitoring program like MSI Afterburner, you'll see that all 4 of your cpu cores will be at 90% in large zerg fights.
---
Drop down to 1080p. Your cpu cannot handle 1440p in large scale Wvw fights
---
Set your character model quality and limit settings to low or lowest.
---
Turn off all anti aliasing, supersampling, and other cpu intensive graphics settings.
---
If you run background programs like chrome, discord, or spotify, open your task manager and set GW2's process priority to High and set the above programs to Below Normal.
---
I play WvW exclusively in GW2 and this is everything I do to maximize fps in large fights.
---
To be fair, so will random random NPC chatter (at least in Lion's Arch).
---
First of all good idea on running each up into the 20s. I always suggest that and have done the same. Things get even better if you have an 80 booster but it's well enough to get a "feel". 
---
It's been said but something will probably click with you. Both race and profession. You can read up on each specialization also to get an idea on what you can evolve into, which for me made a bit of a difference when making alts. 
---
Story wise, ya I agree with Nero it doesn't matter. The only thing that's different is the initial start and some are faster than others to get through imo. If your still a bit undecided on class even after hitting 20s push a bit farther. Even though it's a bit of a time sink it's a good idea to settle on something via experience. PLUS leveling in GW2 is fast. 
---
&gt; Someone just from the team to say “man chrono is outa whack so we really had to define new roles in the boon distribution.” It doesn’t even have to be a dev because I can imagine the Systems Team being on a massive crunch. You could relay notes about your changes to the PR team and have a patch notes talk like LoL or Overwatch does.

&gt; ##Mesmer##
---
&gt; In this update, we've made changes to Signet of Inspiration and Mimic—two core skills in the current skill rotation for chronomancers in raids. These are fairly significant changes with slightly different purposes, although both have been made to address the issue of stacking power multipliers.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; The change to Mimic prevents it from being reset by the chronomancer's Continuum Split skill. This is intended to prevent multiplicative power in the mesmer's kit. We want Mimic to be a skill that allows for unique flexibility in mesmer builds, but its double-casting function created multiplicative power when combined with Continuum Split. This change also gave us the opportunity to give Mimic a scaling recharge time in order make it more versatile for general play.
---
&gt; Instead of the mesmer sharing its own active boons with allies, we've changed Signet of Inspiration to extend the duration of boons that are already on allies. This is intended to put more emphasis on the signet as a skill that augments other support skills rather than one that other support skills feed into.
---
&gt; Neither of these changes are intended to alter the chronomancer's identity as a build focused around quickness and alacrity. However, the power these two skills allowed chronomancers made them a one-stop shop for every boon in the game, which was crowding out other potential roles in raid compositions. In order to reinforce this direction, we've also added quickness and alacrity enhancements to wells.
---
Keep in mind that only Mesmers and Revenants use dual swords effectively. Sword/sword Warriors just sucks.
---
Thanks a lot for the info, still new to all of this.
---
Thanks, appreciate the info!
---
Just don't harvest any more, and save the ones you do have in case you need more trinkets in the future. 
---
&gt; Shattered Observatory is one of the worst fractals imo and I hate running it.
---
They could split it into two separated instances - Skorvald+Viirastra (boosting her difficulty) and Arkk in its own and keep the current one as some story mode activated as single instance by talking to Yokko in the lobby. 
---
Thanks for the reply!

*Beautiful &amp;* **T H I C C**

i have the same CPU as you and using 1080p resolution with a gtx 970. i'm getting 20-30 fps during massive zerg fights (50+ vs 50+). my advise would be to tweak your graphic settings and not rely on nvidia software recommendation. some of the settings that heavily impact fps are reflections (i've set this to none), and character quality and limit (medium or low).
---
To be ready all you need is ascended gear and the agony resistance to do T4 fractals (150 AR is what you need to do the highest level, although some min-max players overcap on AR, because the fractal potion conversion also allows you to 'convert' your AR stats into stuff like precision (allowing you to cap your crit chance better).
---
For now all you need to do is make sure you have full ascended trinkets, and to infuse and attune your rings (and backpack) so you can slot in as much AR as possible. That's enough to get you to T3 I think, and you can work on your weapons and armor while ascending those levels. Armor should be your last priority, since it's the least useful one in terms of stat increase -- go for ascended weapons + trinkets, then armor. 
---
If you're on EU I can try and show you around, especially once you get HoT!
---
noice another video right after his past lore video ossum!
---
As a casual player, I much prefer and exclusively use Longbow over Scepter/Focus in open world, (low level) PvP and (also low level) fractals, but only because it favors my playstyle of strategic, positional play rather than instakilling everything with bursts (which isn't fun to me). I can solo hero-points, defeat champions etc, sure it takes time, but it does the job for me.
---
However:
---
Regardless of my preferences, I agree with everyone else here that Scepter/Focus is objectively a much better option for most people and any serious playstyle and I certainly won't be ruining anyones serious high level fractal/PvP/raid groups with my adamant use of my Longbow.
---
Yeah, DH got a series of nerfs early in HOT in PvP, but that was back when Anet was still trying to keep skills uniform.  They've since moved to split skills and longbow could really use an adjustment now.
---
It's not that I don't believe you, it's just the placement of the map you described seems a little... [weird](https://i.imgur.com/UQbuM8K.png).
---
The difference between games that focus on engaging the player base with many of the changes going on and games that just push out changes the devs feel like. 
---
Communication is important. Recently the explanations have cleared up many things with the community and stopped wide speculation. It's not really a problem of balance as much as the overall problem Anet has been having with communication. Almost all of the drama around the game stems from wild speculation and lack of even simple communication. 
---
So although the team rightfully should have no duty to explain their decisions, in controversial circumstances it may be better to add a comment or simple explanation to clear up any popular misconceptions.
---
Yeah, really hate how fantasy necromancers only know how to raise human skeletons most of the time.
---
Honestly I'm not sure. If you haven't made the build yet, it's best to wait a bit until after the living world episode comes out. Just run around with cheap Berserker gear for now. Whole set in exotics can probably be gotten for under 15g, not accounting for the runes/sigils.
---
This was my previous opinion, but after playing it for a bit I'm finding that's not the case
---
NegeerBeerDeBeer.6381 having some isseus starting the game right now though. keep dcing even though my internet is fine, waiting on support right now.
---
Charrt.
---
5 steps ahead of gw2
---
We asked for things added to the crafting table tab and this happen.
---
We asked for some sort of storage for tonics, it happened.
---
We asked for more bank slots  and it happened.
---
We asked for changes of the instabillities and it happened.
---
We asked for more armor to be added to the game and it happens.
---
We asked for renewing on festivals and it happens.
---
We asked for rewards in WvW and my god it took long but it did happen.
---
We asked for legendary gear and jewelry and it happens.
---
We asked for easier salvage and it happen
---
We asked for things to be stacked better and it happens every now and then.
---
Well i can go on. We ask for a lot of things and some happens, some do not happen now and some get totally ignored but over all if we exclude WvW out of it they respond quite well to sugestions.
---
Even in your hypothetical scenario, the customer is Anet, and you are the dev. In that scenario, the customer is the one who ordered the program/interface and paid for it (Anet). 
---
Gotcha, lets wait and see
---
Because when you play Istan you're abiding by the rules and earning your gold. Just as you earn gold via fractals or elsewhere. You are actively running your character tagging mobs and earning loot. Not possible to keep earnings up by afking right?
---
When I say bigger problem for the economy I'm not trying to compare single people's returns without knowing the full extent of the problem. How can you even start? I've given an estimate of what one botter can make mostly afk in a month to give an idea of the scope of the issue. I don't know how many bottere there are, but it's enough to disrupt the tourney matching 
---
My point is that botting in PvP creates a large, unsustainable, and illegitimate source of income to the game. Istan is a large legitimate source of income to the economy, but if you played at launch you can change Istan with Cursed Shore and you're in the same boat. People are lazy and play at work so if an opportunity to farm afk comes up they take it.
---
Do you think Anet could adjust Istan drop rates? Why don't they? Is it maybe to keep income in line with the rest of the inflated economy?
---
I'm saying PvP is a bigger problem for the economy. Istan is an intended effect
---
**Error 404** *waist not found*
---
Sadly? Is Silverwastes or fractal farming that much more fun?
---
It’s perfect that you posted that exact snippet. This is the skill ceiling reduction that I talked about. Hitting Mimic with the nerf bat was a knee jerk reaction after the community went with that build because it was more efficient now after the SoI nerf. In fact, Mimic abuse in conjunction with SoI was a thing before that, yet it wasn’t the most effective build
---
Now let’s look at what this killed in the process. You had basic WvW strats with mimicing portals or blinks for Portalbombing. It wasn’t easy yet effective if you could do it. Mimicing your veil made flanking much more effective. There’s tons of posts about that, I’m sure you can find those too 
---
I understand that this upsets you somewhat, but I hope you understand that your wording here comes off as rather cruel and malicious towards the community. And is rather insulting.
---
Wow that boss looked so epic, can't wait to play it /s
---
There's a bug where the title shows based on the gender of the character viewing it. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractal_God
---
Translation error
---
That gets asked a lot and is impossible to answer. Everyone falls into a certain play style eventually that they feel comfortable with. I have made each class and ran them all up into the 20s, 30s. I was able to get some kind of feel of their mechanics and really didn't like a few of them. However I did revisit a couple when their specializations came out as it seemed to make them more interesting (Ranger -&gt; Soulbeast for example). 
---
Awesome! I'm using Ventari with Renegade at the moment and it can be so useful, like if a DE is trying to snipe me down I can just put up my reflection and yawn. I definitely agree with the underestimated part, when I see a Herald 99% of the time I know what build they are using and how it plays.
---
What. Anet is one profit based company and they are selling one well defined product. The player buys that defined product. Product changes after they bought it. Customer asks company why their product changed. 
---
Where is that hypothetical lol. 
---
Yep, Silverwastes. And if you try to leave it warns you. 
---
ugh finally some proper trans representation 🙌
---
Enjoy the journey. ;)
---
And yet I think it's impossible to successfully defend the Graveyard, but nobody cares because not a "farm".
---
So my question is where do I find Guilds, that are willing to accept a noobie like me. [PvE|Ger] 
---
&gt;	I wanna make the shinning blade
---
My coffee table? 
---
Seems like it'd be a less-than-legendary weapon, but its attacks on my shins are second to none.
---
This sounds great, I can't wait to try it! Thanks for your insight!
---
it is 2019. He can identify as whatever he wants. :)
---
&gt; Do you feel it would be productive to spend the many, many hours that would be required to discuss each of the changes they made?
---
So they role dices? Spec/skill, buff/nerf and number for % of buff/nerf?
---
Played as power boonstripper/bomber not as condi
---
I think DH LB's problem is Anet seems like they don't know what it should be. It seems like it should be a power weapon, but most of its skills deal conditions, and not even well in comparison. 
---
It just feels like an odd weapon respective to the spec.
---
yeah i got full berserk and i play power dh, already have some ascended rings and amulet.
---
2 bosses, they'd have to add another boss somewhere.
---
LOL
---
Yeah because that square of snow in Desert Highlands has been trolling me for the past year into believing there's some separate square thing there, and it somehow became the guild hall in my brain even though the GH is sand, not snow. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
You can check out r/guildrecruitment or map chat in any major city/starter zone/popular meta event map/world boss.
---
thanks :)
---
yeah, it's bizzarre BUT, we're talking about a core weapon VS an elite spec one sadly.
---
Nerfing scepter would impact the whole class, buffing a lot lbow would  overpower DH.
---
I'd take some damage nerf but burning added to scepter skills tho, and some pve only damage buffs on lbow.
---
Did you just assume their fractal rank?
---
me too, recently i used it while doing world completion on my DH tho, it's pretty fun as weapon, bad but fun.
---
Nice, that was very helpfull. There sure is a lot of content in Gw2 to keep us occupied. Ok, I will try figuring some stuff myself but of course when I get HoT would love to hear from you again!  :)
---
Sadly, Silverwastes is now a joke because of the power creep introduced with HoT and PoF. During core days it was somewhat challenging and thus it was pretty fun to run. RIBA is just incredibly boring to me. 
---
You can blame NCSoft for that, and, well, uh, after you blame them, you can look at how horrendous Anet's marketing has been the past two years. Like, it's been actually awful. I can understand if they don't have a budget for mainline advertising but it's been some _tone-deaf_ stuff.
---
For the start it was more of a Segway to introduce Marjory becoming a Reaper. 
---
Spoilers

---
Later on after watching not-Lazarus resurrect she was hoping to use that power to resurrect her Sister. Of course that was just wishful thinking. 
---
No, the boosts are in Shared Inventory slots and available across all characters until you use them. After use, you can use the shared slot to deposit items to use across all characters with easy access.
---
Deleting characters will only delete what's in your normal bags and equiped gear.
---
Oh yeah. Such a high-effort to create a post with a headline and a link! Im sorry to bother you. You defnly knows "the internet".
---
You're a special kind of idiot.
---
Moving on.
---
English? Please, can we talk about the balance instead? The chat window has dire stats ffs
---
If doing dailies burns you out, stop doing them! Just do the fun stuff directly! That's what I often do as a casual player. I stop grinding the unfun stuff and just go for the fun stuff. Then you'll have more time to do fractals, maybe get into raids, etc.
---
That was my 2 cents.
---
There’s a zone in PoF called desert highlands that has a beautiful snowy zone.  Check out the Desert Highlands video on my channel if interested. 
---
I’ll be doing more of these, so sub and click the bell if ya wanna!
---
Yeah about exploration... the more you complete in a zone, the less you’ll need to do to do when you decide you want to craft a legendary weapon. It requires full completion of all map markers in central Tyria.  So you’ll see everything!
---
I transferred from EU to NA for a hold although a small part of me wishes I had found a different solution. My pvp experience was night and day.
---
So 23 minutes of what I already read on reddit. Kewl.
---
Lol, mimic wasn't even the worst change for mesmer in wvw. Look at bountiful disillusionment and SoI. Both were pillars of support mesmer since HoT or even roughly before that, some began the transition. Both were utterly gutted and made mesmer wholly unusable in wvw group fights.
---
Gaile is not a developer, she's the Forum Communications Team Lead.
---
"Ackshually, it's Idjet!"
---
Well, seems good then that they listen :) and yeah I heard wvw is a touchy subject 😂
---
The artist went for a different outfit for her, one loosely inspired by what she normally wears. (Also the staff would've cost extra)
---
Your actions betray your words. I honestly feel bad for anyone trying to justify his/her negativity in the world to such a lengthy extent. 
---
I hope you'll find peace in your heart some day.
---
She is, but what people want is the developers to answer the questions and communicate. Instead of going back and forth through Gaile. 
---
Fair enough
---
add me too fatal.8693
---
The Primeval Jackal is definitely one of my favourites. It's simple yet fancy.
---
Maybe it is, but when people keep nagging about it over and over and over and over and over and over and over again, one will get tired of it. She is human. She isn't some machine that can just keep taking things over and over again. At some point she will grow tired of people behaving like little kids. 
---
Okay, sadly I try too multiple thing for years with Zodiac and the best I found is using Full helm to hide face and leg that hide it too.
---
Otherwise nothing will fit for having a similar blue color on skins.
---
Only thing I want is class changer on gemstore, that would be (for me) the best update ever.
---
hmm awesome thanks, I didnt know Ranger could DPS with soulbeast TIL.
---
I am gonna assume that this is a essay on how to extract donkey semen to use it as extra spice in your cake recipe. 
---
p.s ready to gouge my eyes out at that unreadable wall of text and no tldr
---
I'm copypasting this from last week's 'What is your unpopular GW2 opinion?'-post:
---
New player races are absolutely possible.
---
Long answer: Most people say all armor and weapons would have to be redone, as well as the personal story, starting zones, cultural armor etc.
---
However, if you really want it, it might be possible at the cost of leaving out some things we are used to.
---
*Personal story and starting zones:* 
---
* A new character could start at Level 80 and skip all that old stuff and instead just hop in at some point of the newer stories (HoT / PoF). 
---
* A new race character might be something that needs to be unlocked with your 'old commander' and becomes the successor
---
* To bend the characters lore a bit, it could just be send from the original new race to one of the older races, disguised under the effect of mesmer magic or whatever, and start leveling as normal (or something more creative and less badly retconned)
---
*Armor, Outfits, Weapons* might be a lot of work, even if new character models share base frames with other races (Tengu / Charr, Largos / Humans or Sylvari, Dwarf / ...Norn or Asura?).
---
However, if we are willing to make sacrifices, we could either
---
* try to make the similarities of races with similar base frames even bigger
---
* stretch old armor to some degree that doesn't fit 100%
---
* use standard models for all old armor and outfits and just add the new ones from now on for the new races
---
* combinations of the above
---
Thanks for an official response!!!!
---
And props to your company for a very fine game! I only wish I'd been here longer, and am looking forward to staying in Tyria for a long time!
---
They used to do this before each section, but even when they did that there were still changes out of left field unrelating to the paragraph they just wrote.  Example: necro axe damage buff balance meme became a thing because for multiple patches it got buffs to its damage without being mentioned at all in the blurb.
---
Maybe they posted on their phone and the format got eaten? 
---
Just look at Starcraft 2 PatchNote, Devs explain why they make every changes and how they feel it'll impact the meta. But their patchnote looks like "increasing damage output of zealot's charge by 0.8%" meanwhile GW2 patchnote looks like "increasing dps of this skills by 150%".
---
Obviously when you make your balance with a shovel instead of a spoon, it's really hard to actually explain and foresee what will happen. The value are so impactful it's almost impossible.
---
Also, think about it, talking about SC2 again (I'm playing SC2 half my free time). Blizzard works on their patchnote, then put it on test server for players to try it out for a duration. They then wait for players feedback, and see how meta is moving, and decided to keep the change, modify it because it's too/not enough strong or remove it completly if it does something really stupid. And this happens two or three times before the update hit the real matchmaking
---
It's really rare in GW2 to see any change after update hit the game unless something totally broken come out from specific way to play (hello thief with 100k+ dps) and there's not test server where people can actually try the patchnote. It's basically they throw their update at us, and we deal with it for ages until an other update comes out.
---
Most player who are actually spending their time playing GW2 on a high level (doing theorycraft and writting guides for their statics) feel like GW2 devs have pretty much no clue what they actually do and how it'll change the meta when they balance the game. Asking devs to explain why they make changes and what they expect to happens with each change could help us understand what they aim for. Players could then make feedback depending on what devs want in order to give them insight from inside.
---
I have watched you do these for years. I think this year I will join you Brother. Ill see you soon. 
---
&gt; Unstable Cosmic Essences  
---
Most recent mistake about fractals imo. Anet already knew about the KP situation in raids and they implemented a KP in fractals. So same issue as raids: without killproof it's hard to do 100CM and with killproof you'd prefer experienced players to complete your 100CM rather quickly.
---
Farming is farming, it depends on the person whats more fun to them, i said sadly because it pretty much makes everything worthless. Before PoF you were kind of excited to get an exotic or even a rare, it was a decent amount of gold you could get while playing what you like, now its just another 20s exotic or another 10s rare. Theres just so much the constant flow of materials, rares, exotic and so on that pretty much destroyed everything thats worth a bit. 
---
By the way, what I've said is applicable to Raids &amp; Fractals only. I am not sure exactly what game modes you are interested in.
---
Diviner's will only be for support chrono, don't worry about that just yet. Go for full zerk exotics for now- don't worry about the other details for now. 
---
Focus on learning the fractals and completing them for now.
---
Crossroads require you to have Asc weapons and trinkets before taking you in,according to their description.
---
&gt; you can even sit now, although only on specifically designed places (which is disappointing and boring on its own)
---
you can actually sit anywhere you want now because you carry a chair/throne with you using the novelties system.  iSits^tm  tech has advanced since the early days.
---
as for new things.  Don't think a new playable race will really do much because we are still playing the same unified story at the end of the day.  Any new novelty will come from some origin story and lore which will quickly wear off after the first playthrough.
---
new classes, better chance of this than a whole new race.  problem is balancing, i don't think ANet wants to add a whole new class and it's elite specs to the balancing pool when they have a hell of a time balancing the 9 + 2 specs each we have now for all modes of play.  I would rather see more transformative elite specs that still take advantage of the base specialization trait lines.
---
Who hurt you?
---
It's not the nature of indoctrination. It's the nature of seeing someone being a massive knob.
---
It's not about effecting the story, it's about how they will do it. They would have to remake 6 years of vocal lines. Remake 6 years of gear fit on this new race. Remake all the animations.
---
These are things that could be done, for sure, but it's going to take enough resources and budget away from everything else. I'd much rather an expansion that brings game changing features like mounts and gliders, and 9 new elites, than one new class and race.
---
You also have to pay 2 additional voice actor for a new race and it's a lot of work for something that is basicly just cosmetic and that most people will not use.
---
Zoidberg is available but the only thing i was remotely proud of there was his fancy sandals
---
&gt; TL:DR; PvP gamemodes in MMOs fail because the dedication needed to get good at a competitive game is simply too much for lazy MMO players to handle properly.
---
Oddly fair, even if it's bonkers - not everyone wants to do the things needed to get competitive, but that's a 'differences between people' issue, not a development concern.
---
ANet says you're very welcome!
---
Nope, we require asc weapons and trinkets for Tier 1 (Which you need for the intermediate bosses).
---
The easy bosses (VG, Spirit Run, Gorse, Trio, Escort, KC, Cairn, MO, River of Souls, Statues of Grenth, and I think CA aswell) have absolutely no requirements.
---
If those branches were a bit lower, this would be a much different picture.
---
Funny the difference a couple inches can make.
---
Ok - so it seems like you're wrapping ethics and intended design into what is good or healthy for the economy and I was keeping those separate and only thinking about the economic effect in a vacuum.
---
Neither of us is wrong in how they assess this (I won't bother arguing this if you try to :D). We just do so differently...
---
Clearly, the PvP exploits are illegitimate income and it hurts the game when that behavior goes unchecked. As for your questions about changing drop rates, I think its complicated. It isn't worth changing things that aren't too far out of control because 1) it takes an effort to do so that could be spent developing new content and 2) a player in the game is good for the game even if they are earning more per hour than ANET prefers.
---
Thanks for taking the time to respond even if others are downvoting you, I've appreciated the conversation.
---
That's a really old bug that happens occasionally.
---
Did you know they recently added new maps to sPvP...I wish they ignored it more than they do.
---
So is Bender trying to win the female robot olympics again?
---
Gear colors are saved in the gear as properties, while the dyes of other customizations like glider, mounts and outfits are saved as properties of the character. Like hair color, but easier to change for the players.
---
That's why it's harder to make back items dyable. As it'll mean reworking the entire data structure for back items.
---
Since custom outfits would have to be saved as skins, they would not be able to store the dyes like gear. It would have to be either on the custom outfit data, or as new character data.
---
Daily achievements, daily fractals, Domain of Istan events (Silverwastes meta if you don't have istan), playing Trading Post.
---
I would definitely pay 800/1200 gems for a Custom Outfit slot and I think other people who like their class but not the fashion of their class will agree with me
---
Will definitely give you a sub, can't wait to check out the Highlands! 
---
Is this actually a good source of revenue? It felt like most of my money was coming from turning magic into leather or trophies and selling them, not the champ bags.
---
her name is Lyssa Edwards and this is Lyssa's secret.

what's the post say/what is being changed or fixed?
---
can't see the forums while at work.
---
What I'd you don't have living world 4 
---
tl:tr added:
---
Pvp sucks not only due to anet but cause the players want just easy win but in the end they just cry and suck
---
Wow.. this is actually pretty good
---
I appreciate the discussion as well (regardless of fake internet points) because it's the only way I'm going to learn more anyways. If I speak harshly it's because I'm a bit of an ass, so says my ex wife so im sorry.
---
I think Istan is designed the way it is as a vehicle for people who want to grind events and mobs, with drop rates adjusted accordingly. Someone mentioned elsewhere that the creation of direct gold is worse for the economy than drops. I'd say when this gold is earned with bots in large amounts against the rules then it's a bigger problem for the economy than Istan. 
---
If you think Istan itself is bad, then you might take the position that the sheer quantities coming out of there (likely far larger than PvP amounts) are a bigger problem for the economy. That's what I've come to understand anyway
---
tera combat is best ive played too.
---
Loving it
---
I love doing the HoT metas, and HP trains in both expacs. The more talkative the map, the better. 
---
Are we missing any class archetype in gw2? I feel like they have done such a good job with the elite specs. And we will get a ton more with next expansion. 
---
Also that power is the cheapest to gear. 
---
I've never really felt the "PvP is dead" argument had any weight, tbh. I queue pretty casually and have really only seen one other person appear in multiple games. I never feel totally OP like I did in early Scourge days. What I see the most is people who don't know how to play on these maps-- who insist on fighting on points in AoE damage instead of killing players from a distance and capping while they respawn, no one rotating to decap points, etc. PvP rewards are insane, the people are almost all non-toxic, etc. 
---
Heya! I stopped during that time period, and just came back a few months ago. This is what I did (it took awhile):
---
1) Do first PoF story to get Mount,
---
2) Do LW2 -&gt; HoT -&gt; LW3 -&gt; PoF -&gt; LW4. (this is a doozy, but its nice to have the story make sense)
---
3) Once you're done with the stories, I started doing some T1 fractal dailies (I had done all of the fractals when I left, but things have changed a bit with them, and how they're organized - still figuring it all out).
---
4) I am back doing a lot of WvW, because well, that's what I did before I left, and now that I'm all caught up on the story, I don't feel so bad WvWing. 
---
Also, check out the [links](http://old.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/links) page, it has a lot of good builds.  I'd also keep an eye out for a HoT HP Train, it'll get you enough Hero Points to unlock one of the specializations, and open up some Way Points  for dailies, etc, which will make playing the story easier.  Can do the same for PoF.
---
I'm having so much fun with GW2 again... but man, it was daunting coming back, I can't even count the amount of times I reinstalled, logged into Lions Arch, had no idea what to do, and left.  Reddit is a great place to get some info, and figure out some good places to start.
---
Neat to see her work here! I still remember her from her Peach cosplay way back when.
---
How about throwing b o m b s
---
*tongue pop* 
---
Yes, voice actors cost money, too.
---
But I'm not sure if 'many won't use' new races. From my observation it seems more like everyone is making one of that new races in other games.
---
And... we have a lot of players from other MMO titles that might miss playing something like a dwarf, darkelf (largos) or whatever. Tengu have been really long asked for.
---
Nerfing scepter would make much more sense tho. Because it also doesmore dps than melee veapons for some reason. And DH is already too strong in pve for the effort it requires. 
---
That part with the missing floor easily takes 30% of the entire fractal duration
---
Yes, that's this game's Forum Communications Team Lead. Blowing stuff out of proportion, behaving harshly and impulsively, and wanting to leisurely enjoy the position in the company instead of doing one of the hardest consumer-facing jobs cool-headedly and professionally.
---
It's been going like this for years, and there've been enough knights to defend her, so it's mostly pointless to start threads like this at this point - you won't get anywhere.
---
[Maybe?](https://i.imgur.com/Ou03CsP.png)
---
Bad news everyone. 
---
It only has burning on Hunter's Ward so I'm not really seeing how it would be a really good condi weapon...
---
Rares were fairly worthless for years before that, because of how World Boss trains worked.   Exotics gradually lost value, as people unlocked all their skins and it just started coming down to the sigil and rune. Neither of these were caused by Istan.
---
Love the art style! A few people have pointed out some proportional issues but I personally like the style of it and I think in some types of art it's fine to look past that (not that their comments aren't valid though!).
---
What does she look like in game though? I'm curious :P
---
iberu is on holidays
---
Thanks for this small install guide!
---
Will definitely try it out.
---
Why exactly do you think that hook is heavier on the system than reshade itself or rather do you think it decreases the gw2 performance?
---
the champs should spawn again.
---
Where did I write GW2 raids are hard? I've mentioned that they're more dynamic.
---
Probably the best advice, and it's in the bottom cus you said "fractal virgin"
---
Books get patched next Thursday, never had Iberu not spawn though o_O
---
&gt; Please stop making excuses for them.
---
It's what krall does, and always has done.
---
Here's a screenshot of what she looks like in game [https://imgur.com/a/HdrhEWe](https://imgur.com/a/HdrhEWe)
---
As a player that started a few months ago:
---
1. Get your raptor then go back and do the story in order, starting with LWS2 if you can. I'm currently playing through LWS3 when I log in, and it's generally a really good experience. You can physically FEEL the writing getting better as you move forward in time through the living world seasons. 
---
2. Find an elite spec that sounds like fun to you. Metabattles is a website that has descriptions of different builds for different content. I usually build for open world or fractal/dungeon, with some personal touches. For hero points, join trains in the PoF maps. Personally, I'm REALLY enjoying the engineer's holosmith. It has crazy damage and interesting gameplay. (I'm not very good, but that takes me to point 3...) 
---
3. Gear up! Armor and trinkets! If you're a scrub like me, don't listen too hard to Metabattle's gearing suggestions, they build for pure damage and no survivability. I personally go for a mix of Berserker and Marauder in my power builds. Seriously, Marauder armor is great. I die *so much less*. 
---
4. Try out fractals! Low tier fractals are generally pretty chill, and you don't need to be very good to be successful. They're a fun introduction to the endgame. Whenever I'm shaky on the mechanics of one, I always lead with that and thank my teammates for pointers ahead of time, and I've yet to have a bad experience! 
---
5. While you're building up gold, make sure to do your dailies! It's 2 gold every day for like, 10 minutes of investment. 
---
6. Find things that you enjoy! When I'm a bit tired of the story and don't feel like focusing on fractals, I'll pop into WvW, or hunt world bosses (Dulfy has a timer on her site), or farm RIBA in the silverwastes. Maybe you'll like rollerbeetle racing, or doing jumping puzzles or something. This is personal variety to keep you sane, after all. 
---
Good news, everyone!
---
Materials into the economy are without question better for the game than raw gold. Every time someone needs to convert materials to something else, 15% is taken out if they use the TP and 100% is taken out if they unlock a skin. The key to a good GW2 economy is to keep people unlocking expensive skins and using the TP a lot.
---
Unrelated to the economic perspective we've been discussing so far, the problem I've had with Cursed Shore, SW, and Istan-type farming since release is lack of variety.
---
There is usually a 'best choice' and I had high hopes that map-bonuses would solve this. Seems they only were creative enough to implement a rotation in core Tyria though.
---
My ideal scenario would be to nerf returns by ~20% but have meaningful map rewards that add 5-30% returns (I haven't bothered with math to see what % map rewards give in Istan versus drops, but I expect its pretty low). Istan would usually be an excellent farm, but some weeks it wouldn't compete with other maps and other weeks, it would be even better than it is currently. I realize this is artificial and some people wouldn't like it, but it would suit my desire to be drawn to different corners of the map when I press M.
---
Of course, the %#s need to be tweaked to be meaningful because I am completely making them up and you don't want to push people into event exploitation like tagging and leaving too much as is done in the SW RIBA. It works in SW and doesn't harm anyone, but it could be detrimental elsewhere.
---
There's also a ~3 hour video on YouTube to watch (or at least skim through) that covers Season 1, as it's not playable due to how it was made. Without that, you miss a lot of new character introductions, as well as some backstory that's relevant to Season 2. If you're enjoying the story now, then you've got a lot to look forward to, because they've really improved on that. 
---
Thanks! I'm very well aware, I should've called it the eternal hell of leveling gear *looks* or transmog or fashion or whatever :p 
---
Would've been impressive if I had made it to level 50 now without gear.
---
Not fair enough, just armchair philosphy trying to shut you down. You're absolutely right. PvP farm bots are a bigger issue and cause much more damage to the economy. Until you remove that noise no one can tell you that Istan ruins the economy at all.
---
Nice, looking forward to this!
---
TL;DR : salty PvP player unleashing on PvE players that "have it easy and play the easy game".
---
Bender/Darth vader looks great
---
let me guess, a fat norn with that pink Obelix mustache?
---
So yes, there are ideal professions for beginners, and I agree with /u/Intreductor that minionmancer Necro is a good idea for that.
---
As far as the more challenging professions, bare in mind that you really don't need to worry about optimal DPS for a loooong time. When I started the game, I picked engineer and had loads of fun with all the varied abilities it had, playing it casual even though engi is known for often having some of the most complex DPS rotations in the game. So you can pick whatever and just play your own way.
---
Also, even in that regard, the game makes sure to take you through it slowly, so you'll have plenty of time to get used to things without suddenly being thrown to the sharks.
---
And with RP, there are tons of RP guilds that you can join that will do their best to keep the RP aspects alive for you. There seem to be quite a few resources just by googling "gw2 guilds." But [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/guildrecruitment/) is a link to a subreddit dedicated to recruitment.
---
I hope this helps!
---
I've never encountered much issue in DS but I don't do it much. It's probably been several months since I last did it and usually if there is anything it is during the blighting tower phase.
---
Hi folks! Loooong time GW2 player here, you might even remember me from a spree casting the ESL PvP tournaments a few years back!
---
Since then I have been making news + guide content for some other games, and decided to bring what I have learnt to my favorite game of all time, Guild Wars 2!
---
* If you want to follow me on twitter &lt;3 - [https://twitter.com/DIV0K](https://twitter.com/DIV0K)
---
* I checked the rules and they only seemed to say no livestream posts, sorry if I shouldn't have done this mods! I'm new to the sub! :D
---
* If you have an idea of something you want covered other than what I say at the end of the vid, let me know ;)
---
I am beyond happy to be back in the Guild Wars world making stuff :D
---
The thing that's odd though was they really needed to just put True Shot's cool down to 6-8s, and touch nothing else for pvp. The biggest issue with the longbow at release was the fact true shot hit like a truck with a 4s cool down. It didn't matter if you dodged it since it was going to be back again soon.
---
I like the design of the longbow since it has such a straightforward game plan. Skill one is damage, skill 2 is burst, everything else is utility. 
---
I'm expecting next episode to be a buildup and episode 6 to be just the fight with klark cuz you can't really shove all this in one episode can you
---
Not logical fallacy. I disagree with you that Istan farm is an issue. You can either prove it is an issue or keep using words that make you feel like you're smarter than everyone else.
---
And up to lvl 80 is story and content are really old and boring compared to expansions:-)
---
If the grind is too much, taking a step away from the game till you can get over that grind bump seems plausible is always a recommended course of action. Guild wars is a game about making your own fun. If you’re not having as much fun, coming back to it when you’re ready isn’t a bad idea
---
It seems guild wars might not be your kind of tea. 
---
On another note you might want to try out PvP or WvW when you haven't.
---
I want a revamp of core Tyria:
---
* 5-6 year bugs fixed
---
* Legacy content updated with modern QoL and design (guild missions, dungeons, activities)
---
* Old skins given updated physics
---
* New life in home instances
---
* References to personal story / personality system in living story
---
I don't see these things happening, but they're still my wishlist.
---
I didn't really notice much of a drop from not getting those champ bags.
---
You're allowed to disagree.  I don't really care.  
---
But seriously; if "logical fallacy" is too fancy a word for you, put the game down and finish your GED.
---
I know you're being facetious but...there is trans representation. In Lion's Arch. Funny enough considering the topic, just north of the Fractal portal, even.
---
Go listen to the dialogue over there about "relief efforts after the attacks on Lion's Arch." Subtle, but pretty amazing.
---
welcome to gw2 &lt;3 try some pvp and wvw when you totally got into the game. we are waiting for new player willing to learn and improve :)
---
Millers in itself isn't stronger than the main servers like kodash / elona / ... 
---
Millers isn't bad either. It's just significantly smaller than these.
---
See elona / rs / dl as 80% of an international server. Kodash is 100% of international server (no links, stand alone and stronk). Elona and RS struggle to get out of T4/T5 without some extra players to help out. This in turn makes players play less; as they have nothing to do that they find fun. This makes them struggle to ppt up... Repeat.
---
Add some players from millers, and getting to T3-T2 or even T1 occasionally is doable. This makes it more fun to play on the link, and overall makes the server more active. 
---
Millers doesn't /strictly/ carry these servers. The main community remains on the main, not the linked server in all cases. However, miller is that extra bit that pushes them from T4/ T5 to T2 / T3 stable; and allows them to fight opponents they enjoy / want to fight. This makes the link overall a lot more healthy to play on, especially for guilds and commanders (which trickles down towards pugs). 
---
Kif is amazing. 
---
I'm getting a GW1 Kryta mission feeling, something like Sanctum Cay or D'Alessio Seaboard.
---
It kinda sounds like a lot of these issues might be addressed by finding a fractal static - if you find farming dull then fractals can be a much more effective way of getting ascended gear.
---
There's a decent chance of ascended drops in fractals, and they can be fairly lucrative too. Maybe the best thing is to look at your guilds and see if there is any interest in forming a static there, or alternatively you could pug and add good players you find to your friends list to try and form one that way.
---
No, they work for shareholders, or in the case of a privately owned company, they work for the management. 
---
Yeah, only LB 4 by default burns. I'd sooner call the weapon a "control" weapon, with displacement and snares all around and LB1 arrows bouncing to other targets if they stand too close. The LB on DH was meant to enforce area control as a much more centralized theme. Conditions are just a factor of base Guardian if we really look at it, but "control" is what the LB does on DH.
---
Sure, let's say 5 hours, gotta earn and keep maxed participation, takes double that amount without boosters though (About 9-10 hours) GoB alone should be the longest item to get, at least in my opinion. 
---
Join the snowcrows and discretize discords and ask them. Note that things might change Tuesday with Diviner stats possibly being added, but there shouldn’t be much change in regards to rotation.
---
I never read PvP/WvW banter, I don't care about raid build discussions (that also happen to have a separate sub), and I think everyone who asks the same goddamn googleable questions for the 1000th time or praises BeST coMMuNiTy should receive a 1-week suspension from a real-life tree by their real-life neck.
---
Art posts that are not screenshots and took actual effort? Yes, please. Those posts, actual news/guides and datamining are the only types of content I care about in this sub. So no, please no megathreads, they are biased and harmful.
---
That said, I don't see how *optional* filters would hurt me and people like me, so "whatever" about those.
---
That's every position where you deal with customers though... I don't really see that as a valid excuse.
---
Doesn't Scepter work for condi builds because of Symbol of Punishment hitting a lot? AFAIK Longbow is slow so the burning from Virtue of Justice wouldn't proc anywhere near as much. 
---
You want to talk about underwhelming? Talk about thief MH pistol.
---
...balance dev already replied with "no" to anything (yes anything)...
---
...anet is/has probably pared balance team down to 2-3 at this point...
---
I mean... You are proud enough of bender to show him like this, zoidberg can't be that bad, now can he?
---
As said, next Tuesday brings a new gear stat which might be useful for support chrono. Guess updated guides will follow soon after this patch.
---
You the guy in Para with the name "Zapp Brannigan" but using umlauts/diacritics?

fractals! get good at 100 CM, learn that it's not worth it without a static, join a guild, and then you're pretty much end game

I can help you through it, and explain everything along the way :D
---
I'll add it to my list of Legendaries to craft. Have to use these 15,000 airship parts on something.
---
Sounds more unique now. Not sure if it just wasn't as audible in the first trailer or not. I still love it. Can't wait for the 8th!
---
Waiting for offended people to say "if you want a competitive game go play something else".
---
Looks great but not legendary. 
---
Does it shoot lightsabers? It sounds like it shoots lightsabers.
---
FYI you don't need ascended to get your toes in the Raid doors. Full exotics, proper build, know your rotations well, and watch some youtube videos is enough to join some raid training runs.
---
Coo. A fellow quaggan fan.
---
Oh wow. You mean once again, Gw2 sub blew something out of proportion before knowing what it would actually look like? I’m in shock. 
---
Gorgeous in its simplicity. Going to look fantastic on my Valkyrie-inspired Dragon Hunter! Thanks for the link!
---
oopsiee
---
That was back then though when everyone wanted to craft ascended. Now you can just buy the time gated mats to craft the ascended gear in a few days since those mats has gotten alot cheaper.
---
Domain of Istan is moderately better than SW RIBA at the moment.
---
SW moved away from chest farms as the spawn rate got nerfed, so they do a hybrid of Events + Chests in downtime that is referred to as RIBA.
---
First, I was talking about not paying anything at all. Second, I don't disagree with you but what convenience are you talking about? I can't think of anything I felt I had to purchase (doesn't mean there isn't anything).
---
For me Viper is unreachable. It takes money to get armorsmith,to get the damn time gated materials,and then the infusions,and then...ugh,its just so much gold needed. And since this game has no gold farms(No,20g/h from Istan is far from optimal),it s such a chore.
---
thank you ^^
---
uh same !! tho originally i wanted to use The Golden Cave, but figured this one fit the video muuuch better :D
---
I wish they'd stop uploading videos on Twitter cos the video quality is always butchered
---
To be honest, it's just a cultural difference in what is considered toxic. NA toxicity is, from what I noticed, just different than EU's. Might be less vocal but i wouldn't consider it any less toxic. There are some trends, altho obviously both kinds happen on both sides. 
---
In EU people will be more likely to comment on gameplay, as well as give instructions and ask what people play. It also means that if games go sour, people end up telling others what they did bad in various digrees of not-so-nicety. Overall there's a stronger adherance to meta, altho that just might be due to the much larger population of high-end players. 
---
In NA you'd not get as much chatter, either good or bad. If people are upset with a player, rather than telling them what they did or didn't do wrong, they'd start "subtly" trolling them. Jumping on their corpse rather than ressing their own allies. Dancing off node while watching allies struggle / die to clearly much higher rated enemies. Plain going AFK. Very high rated players going for lord / beast / .... when they obviously know better.
---
In my (EU) opinion, what is considered toxic on NA was also absurd at times. For example... People were flaming me for going far even in plat+. Probably related to constantly playing with silver players regardless of your rating, but hey. I started to tell people I'd go far before the game. You'd regularly get players telling you if you don't go mid, they'll afk. Others would simply follow me the entire game regardless of which node I go to, or plain afk, or flame for going far, ... The game didn't even START YET - but they're already mmmadd. 
---
Meanwhile if you went far on bunker druid in plat+ on EU in those days, nobody would bat an eye BECAUSE IT'S LITERALLY YOUR ROLE. 
---
Also targetting players is seen as hostile. Telling players to rotate / leave is considered hostile. Literally anything you say about builds, playstyles, roles can be considered as "telling you how to play" and assumed to be toxic. The amount of times i'd get +1'd by auramancer or warrior on bunker druid is already so high it's pretty tilting. But then if you simply tell them to leave or target them, they fully flip their shit... Meanwhile on EU it's not uncommon communication and they'll usually rotate; at least in plat. 
---
In EU you ask a guard if they're heal or if they can go fb or idk and they'll say "yes" or "no" or swap. In NA you ask people to swap to support or a role your team needs and you'll get snarky comments about how they'll do whatever the fuck they want much more often. 
---
tl dr : EU trolls fucked your mum, NA trolls just throw / grief ingame. Wouldn't exactly consider game quality any better in NA, because it certainly isn't. 
---
“I’m gonna make my own Lions Arch with black jack and hookers!”
---
That makes sense. Damn I was hoping for there to be more to it lol.
---
No, I'm saying the original preview looked like actual shit.
---
To be fair, a large portion of this isn't much better, given it's Twitter, but it's still an improvement as far as showing off the bow goes.
---
what, [FIRE] went on winter holiday? With SfR, RoF got to T1 and it was mostly their work I think, so what happened here?
---
Dude... what do you even expect a legendary to look like?
---
- Draw effect
---
- Footfalls
---
- Heavy glow
---
- Huge glowy projectiles
---
- Projectile SFX
---
- Transforms when stowed
---
What do you even want?
---
True, but the symbol is *really* good. If Firebrand could wield it, and cover the time between symbol uses with tome skills then it could potentially rival sceptre. I'm not trying to say it would be the best condi weapon, just point out that it's surprisingly good as a condi weapon.
---
At the very least I would like to see the autoattacks changed into a 3-attack skill chains like mesmer and necromancer, with a greater payload on the 3rd skill. 
---
Maybe even have interactions between the attacks.
---
Something like this:
---
* Fire: 
---
 1. Raises the scepter to damage and burn 1 enemy. 
---
 2. Slightly larger damage, 2 stacks of burning, and gain might when hitting a burning enemy. 
---
 3. Damage and burn target, and leave an area on the floor. After 1s the area pulses dealing a short 1s burn, but it also increases the duration of burning on enemies that are bleeding or are vulnerable. 
---
* Water:
---
 1. Swing the scepter sideways to throw 1 ice shard that deals damage and sticks to the enemy. 
---
 2. Throw 2 another ice shards that deal 1 stack 4s vulnerability and also stick to the enemy. 
---
 3. Throw another 3 shards that also deal 2 stacks 4s vulnerability and stick to the enemy.
---
 The ice shards from these autoattack can stack up to 10, and explode dealing 8s vulnerability each when hit with with skills that cause burning or bleeding. If 10 stacks have been accumulated when it explodes, it also deals chilled for 1s. 
---
* Air:  
---
 Auto-attack Arc Lightning gets swapped with Skill #2 Lightning Strike.  
---
 Now Arc Lightning is skill #2 and no longer deals damage while channeling. Instead it channels for 1.5s creating a faint line effect to the target, then releases an instant lightning arc to the target that arcs to up to 4 enemies in its path to the target. This skills changes when traited with Aeromancer's Training: Dealing greater damage and being unblockable against the main target, and dealing bonus damage to the main target for each enemy hit in its path.
---
 1. Swing the scepter up to summon a lightning strike on target, and charge them with static electricity. 
---
 2. Summon a stronger lightning strike on target, and charge them with 2 stacks of static electricity. 
---
 3. Summon an even stronger lightning strike on target. This last attack will always be critical if the target has 5 or more stacks of vulnerability, and it will be unblockable if they have weakness.
---
* Earth
---
 * Swing the scepter downwards to throw a stone shard that deals damage and bleeding. Accumulate a stone shard on self. Cannot crit. 
---
 * Throw 2 stone shards. Accumulate 2 stone shards on self.  Cannot crit. 
---
 * Throw 3 stone shards and a rock to the enemy, and accumulate 3 stone shards and a rock on self. Cannot crit. 
---
 Player can accumulate up to 6 stone shards and a rock from this autoattack, and they fly to the enemy when dealing a critical hit. Stone shards deal damage and bleeding, the rock deals damage and weakness. 
---
Same for guardian.
---
* First attack would be a slow orb as usual.
---
* Second would be a larger orb with a 10% faster projectile and deal vulnerability.
---
* Third would move 20% faster, be a piercing projectile finisher that can hit 3 enemies, deal vulnerability to target, and give might to self for each enemy hit.
---
There were plenty of competitive players on release and in GW1. The majority left because anet made it increasingly obvious that they have no interest in this part of their fanbase. As a result, GW2 has less players, less income and less diversity. And it'll never fix it's pvp / wvw modes without a proper revamp. 
---
Aside from completing all the (reasonable) acheivments there's really no way you can be hardcore. T4 fractals are easy and judging by the people that do t4 (pugs) the skill level is extremely low for something that is considered endgame content. There are raids though! And you can be a hardcore raider but there is almost 0 progression in raids. Nothing. Fractals have fractal god title to aim for. Raids have challange modes but they are a 1 time thing and you can just buy flat out anyway. That's why raid titles, aside from envoys herald, are completely trash. Its hard for me to describe. I've done thousands of raids, I have the shitty titles but for me it also just goes down the category of "i log in, do the 'weekly' and log off. Theres nothing hardcore about it. Imo the only area of gw2 that can be considered hardcore is WvW. Why not PvP? Because its infested by and ruled by bots.
---
Gw2 is not a hardcore game. Nothing about it is designed to be hardcore. Raids are what they call endgame dungeons in other MMOs... So yeah. My advice is: just do what you're currently doing because that is what a huge majority is doing and the reason they're doing it is because theres nothing else. WvW alliance system will hopefully be a godsend for me and many more people.
---
I love guild wars 2. But i would find it incredibly boring if i cant share my experiences and achievements. 
---
I think youre forgetting that this isnt a single player pc game. Its an mmo world thats supposed to be played with social interactions. Nothing in life has the lasting allure of good company so my advice is to join a guild with like minded people with similar goals. Maybe they will inspire you to keep logging in and work towards those goals. 
---
I have done everything there is to do in raids yet i find myself having more fun than i would imagine with a new group of people. Its fun to login and banter around with them about different raid comps and past mistakes. We also motivate each other to improve on our classes which i wouldve never done before. 
---
You can still find your own motivations and theres nothing wrong with playing however you like. Maybe you could try different game modes like wvw or pvp. Maybe you could try map completion or do every dungeon path. Maybe you could try leveling an alt to experience different classes. 
---
Whatever you decide to do good luck and have fun :)
---
They said they aren't interested in making more CMs in the near future. 
---
Seriously - I have to wonder if people wanted The Shining Bow. Or maybe FFXIV's [Terpander](https://i.imgur.com/2zoBdeM.jpg). Or, conversely, something impossibly silly like Shooshadoo or the HMS Divinity - which would probably have received an equally sour reception.  
---
  
---
But hey, it's still better than the Claw of the Khan-Ur.
---
Zapp The Great is AWESOME.
---
At least with double pistols you can spam 3 and hope they die fast enough for you to not run out of initiative
---
I doubt it will have one. They said on an AMA that they aren't interested in make any more for the time being.
---
Having certain maps be vastly more rewarding (without any gameplay requirements) isn't healthy for the longlevity of all content, but mostly the less rewarding content / metas / ...
---
Really cool takes man ! What would be awesome if you decide to make another video in that style could be to include dialogues in a coherent fashion in order to recreate the story ;D
---
Nibbler is terrifying...  I love it!
---
Tbh its easier alt farming hab, maw and legendary for me. Unbound magic is a bottleneck for me
---
What's the big deal of making it a CM anyway? T4 Twilight Oasis is harder than either CM if you ask me, so I don't see why they can't just make this one difficult on T4 as well. 
---
Regular T4 fractals could always use a difficulty bump anyway being as 99% of the challenge lately has been absurd instab combinations.
---
video quality is like console footage
---
They farm liquid gold in PvP.
---
However, the amount of gold / mats generated through istan is far higher than these bots. A map has 150-200 players. That's 3-4k gold / hour rather than per month; and EU has several istan farm maps during prime time. 
---
Laughs in WvW.
---
Axe is FAR superior. It's not the symbol on axe but axe 3 that does burning on hit as well as the third attack on the auto chain. More importantly because the axe does double hits on the auto chain it is amazing for proccing passive F1. 
---
Since shortbow has the bouncing projectile already, ricochet was considered redundant, and they wanted to make pistols focus on single targets.
---
But now that deadeye has the weapon to focus damage on single targets, I would prefer if they made the pistol trait change the autoattack. I really like these new traits that replace weapon skills. 
---
For example, Ankle Shots could be changed and renamed to something like "Heavy Shots".  
---
In addition to dealing crippled every 8s and bonus damage against crippled foes, this new version of the trait would also change the pistol autoattack into a 3 skill chain with 6 attacks and extra area damage.
---
1. First attack: An improved version of Vital Short named Vital Round that deals extra bleeding when flanking enemies.
---
2. Second attack: Mercy Rounds. Shoot twice. Each hit deals damage and bleeding, and extra damage and bleeding on crippled enemies. 
---
3. Third attack: Brutal Rounds. Shoots 3 times, then do a reload animation.
---
 * If all 3 attacks hit, an extra attack is released behind the enemy, dealing damage, crippled an bleeding to 3 enemies behind the target in a cone. 
---
 * The Reload is an aftercast animation that usually takes 1.5s and ignores alacrity and quickness, but it will speed up to just 0.5s if all 6 hits in the autoattack chain land on the same target. 
---
 The whole autoattack chain would take roughly 3s, plus 0.5-1.5s for the reload. 
---
Remember the chaos weapons from GW1? Kinda looks like that but with a bit of armor on it. So I get what he's saying. I think it looks alright. But I think kudzu looks WAY better.
---
The LOD effect scales, so it won't start to kick in until there is a chaotic group fight like you mentioned.
---
Welcome! Try to find a good guild and/or friends to play with and have fun. Don't stress out about leveling up, as you'll soon be drowning in level up tomes.
---
first off  "they need to come out and say why they did the chose they made and the chose they did not make" is a really poor way to think about talking with any devs. They dont NEED to, but is sure is nice when they do and there is some amount of peaking behind the curtains going on, but thats not really a discussion. 
---
The second thing that players often forget is just how literal we take everything that devs say/post and how long our collective memory is vs the dev(s) that posted something. Just because a dev talked about something does not mean that something is a guarantee, and should never be taken as such unless explicitly stated as such. Use this post as a prime example how deep everything is looked into and theorized about, and maybe you can now see/remind yourself why devs dont always want to converse with the player base.
---
I appreciate the effort and all but aren't most of these not very good? I wouldn't know what half of them were referencing by themselves 
---
Where are the weapons? Spoiling them at such an old age already?!
---
Attack his arguments not his character, also do explain how this case is a false equivalence instead of dropping a wikipedia link.
---
Yeah but it very much under performs in those game modes. Certain builds, many of which are meta just completely invalidate a LB meditrapper. Particularly any builds that run extremely high protection uptime, or builds that have excessive access to stability, or builds that run a lot of reflect (power or condi mirage can both easily trait to get this). It just can't do decent damage, and what little it has left - the CC - is nullified very easily. 
---
The main thing that holds LB back from being able to do reasonable damage is not being able to take BGH for the grandmaster trait.
---
&gt; What's disheartening is that you're reading so much into this.
---
this is only allowed to go one way, from the players to the devs. Devs are always supposed to give players the benefit of the doubt and be the most kind thoughtful , intuitive, and forgiving beings onthe planet dont'ya know.
---
/s
---
New player.
---
Started a necro toon, but very unsure of what path to go in terms of build, what weapons to use, where to put hero points, etc. 
---
Are there any resources that can point me in the right direction? What are seen as generally strong PvE builds? 
---
More than 500 upvotes now. Yes. Victim complex 
---
Your old character would probably be fine. I stop playing the game for periods of time too, and I find that usually my builds (for PvE atleast) are still relevant. You would only need to make a new character unless you really wanted too. 
---
If you think you're getting depressed, try not to be afraid to reach out to the people around you. 
---
I hope I could help in anyway I can!
---
Hi as promised now the second uncut ranked match, closer this time and with illusion of life utility instead portal and very nice music (music artist special). hope you can enjoy! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NPo9-be7xE
---
I did a google search for "strap on". Would want to fight with those on my feet.
---
Love the armour setup! Invisible shoes? I have those on my [Necromancer to fit the "Desert Mage"](https://imgur.com/a/pJO54Re) kinda look and was so pleased with how it came out :D
---
I would disagree, as an ex WoW and ESO player once you get used to skills not locking you in place mesmer is incredibly fun and Mirage is my absolute favorite thing to play in any game mode
---
Dungeons! I started trawling through the dungeon LFGs, I miss doing them, helping new folks is fun to me, and most of them are quick n relatively easy. Also helps that I'm working on the armor collections (it's long overdue that I finish those)
---
carefully recommending wvw and pvp :)
---
Oh my god, it reminds me of main theme from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban game and Balthazar's Theme from Azurik: Rise of Perathia so much! Why isn't this even on ANet's soundcloud?
---
Lol the thing is buddy, I dont care if it changes people's minds, he'll I'm not trying to do so to begin with, I was just giving hats off to the OP for trying but at the same time saying it wont change anything, dont get too butthurt. Only minds I care about are my buddies I play this game with, and we get along just fine. 
---
I am perfectly content with the current state of things I am not complaining at all, and unlike you who is blind af from all the positive vibes that any sort of negative comment deserves a f u, I give 0 sh*ts what u think. Oh were definitely done here, now go bother someone else boy.
---
god bless Bless online and WoW expac muha
---
It cost me an arm and a leg for them, but it was worth it for my druid
---
Leela's face actually looks surprisingly accurate, even without the eye.
---
In my very personal opinion scepter does look and feel good. autoattacks should not all have to be very fancy and hard hitting feeling.
---
This is why the gods created Tyria. 
---
thats a gemstore skin. this is a legendary https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fire-Breathing_Longbow .... o wait...
---
I love how you draw charr cubs but I'll be honest, the sideways cub is a little awkward to look at. It's like you draw the face right-side up and then rotated it, I'd that makes sense. Doesn't feel like a natural pose.
---
My favorite part is the little noses and mouths, it's my main weakness when it comes to baby felines x3 Do you have grown up versions of them?
---
Will this include a fix for the first 2 chests in palawadan?If they spawn pre-opened you lose out on 2 chests worth of loot.
---
Someone once told me it didn’t matter, but the end they count.
---
You can only open 28 instead of 30 chests if the first set spawns pre-opened
---
Just in case it wasn't mentioned already, classes in GW2 are not pigeon-holed in roles like WoW ones are. They are COMPLETELY different. So you have to investigate them individually. For example,
---
* Mesmer is a squishy, light armor, damage dealer right? Well they also have wells to pulse Aegis and block damage entirely, several second evades, team AoE cooldown reduction, massive stealths, projectile reflects, and AoE heals. Not to mention you create clones of yourself and spread aggro around.
---
* Engineer places turrets and traps right? Well you can also use a sword and shield for block tanking and manage an overheat mechanic for power DPS.
---
* Necromancer creates minions right? Well you can spec into toughness/vitality and have a nightmarishly tanky Reaper Shroud build where you fight enemies directly with a giant Scythe. Or go Scourge and make your team invincible with shields.
---
Look on GW2 Metabattle for different builds and see that each of them play fairly differently and some more drastically different than others. I would say classes in GW2 are more of a "theme" than a hard role.
---
its azureflame thrown in the forge with a chaos bow. thats about it.
---
I was stating that axe is still far superior since you stated only axe 2 (actually axe 3 and auto attack 3) had direct burning. 
---
the last time I asked something in snowcrows discord after scrolling back multiple days of discussion and using the search bar, the only response I got was complaints about patch days leading to alot of questions....
---
I wouldn't be unhappy if every Fractal got new music.  Some of them sorely need it. 
---
I'm split on this. On the one hand I really don't like the concept of KPs, on the other hand the difference in fractal CM between experienced groups and noobs is extreme. Takes like half the time to complete a run and it's way less demanding overall. I'm not sure, if I'd run fractal CM so frequently without a somewhat reliable and easy way of finding experienced teammates.
---
Come off it dude. One persons design, and she makes really great innovated designs.
---
If you don't like it then don't make it. I think legendaries like Flames of War, C&amp;C, and the Dreamer look like actual dogshit, so I don't make them. I don't remind a redesign of them, because I understand that that ridiculous style of design appeals to some people. It's all about the balance between options, so I'm not sure why people are throwing a fit because Pharus DOESN'T look like shit.
---
If you open your map (M) while currently standing on a map needed for World Completion, the map legend (icons) will show in the top left corner. If you're in a map that does not count toward World Completion, it won't.
---
Only so much you can do in gw2
---
Everything about DH is definitely designed to be about area control, traps can reveal, cripple, ensnare, F1 cripples and pulls (Radiance has a trait that can cause immobilization that sort of gels with this if you dont mind sacrificing damage), F2 can be traited to immobilize, and F3 is a crappier Guard shield 5 that provides crappier area blocking. The "hunter" aspect of the spec is honestly pretty realized.
---
I’m pretty damn envious of FFXIV’s weapon and armour skins. 
---
You shouldn't need that until **after** you finish Bifrost III which would explain the problem.
---
I disagree. 
---
1) pvp is not as visually pleasing as pve.  in pve we can have huge beautiful maps to explore and savior while in pvp we fight in small maps that can get old 
---
2) some people don't enjoy the competitiveness of pvp, as it leads to toxicity 
---
3) balancing interactions between one class vs 8 other classes is a lot more intricate than balancing classes vs pve mobs, not to mention map and side balance 
---
4) differences in enemies that we face ; What I mean by this is in pve we can fight dragons and other amazing creatures while in pvp we're relegated to fighting people 
---
5) some people play games to have fun/chill/relax, it's hard to do that when you're in pvp because you need to focus as hard as you can to avoid getting blasted as opposed to casual pve content. 
---
To be honest op, you seem like someone who thinks he's hot shit for pvping and wants to put down pve'ers because you think they're Inferior players. 
---
Tl;Dr - there's a bunch of cool things pve brings that pvp can't 
---
ITT - Op being a salty pvper who thinks pvpers are superior human beings for beating the shit out of other players in an mmo
---
Thanks so much for those kind words and the critique is very much appreciated! Many people already told me they thought I just copied the one face, rotated it, so it would be sideways. I actually don't know what's up with that because I painted both faces separately and in the position they are in the finished artwork. Maybe the pose is just a little bit off xD Anyway I don't have a grown up version but maybe I'll paint them some day! 
---
"fEeL fReE tO bUy 50 aS wElL tO iNcLuDe YoUrSeLf In ThE sAmPlE sIzE"
---
Today I learned you're unable to handle criticism. "You can't say anything unless you do it too" is childish at best.
---
&gt; But hey, it's still better than the Claw of the Khan-Ur.
---
As a Charr main, that hurts. ;_;  
---
Because I found Claw pretty disappointing. 
---
what level are you? I think map completion as a viewable mechanic only unlocks once you have a character level 14
---
the music is drowning out the bow's sound ...
---
Ah, didn't realize that was a thing in PvP... I tried the mode a few times and I haven't enjoyed it. And I figured that would be the case, in terms of multiple players, but I didn't want to say anything when I wasn't sure exactly how bots were getting gold.
---
YES
---
i want more projectiles to see my legendary projectiles, and while you at it go do smth with focus projectiles too
---
but I bet they saved enough artist hours to put together a whole  packs of mounts for a new adoption set.
---
Well Terpander looks worse.
---
As a huge fan of both games, I'd almost say they both have merits. 
---
FFXIV's 'legendary' weapons look absolutely fantastic, but I'm really fond of all the little extras you get with a GW2 legendary - new effects, footfalls, etc.  
---
Similarly, FFXIV's armour designs run circles around GW2's - but FFXIV's dye system is hot garbage.
---
Only 15,000 airship parts? That is barely anything.
---
Which archetype do you like the best is other fantasy settings?
---
Is isn't about talent. No one said it's bad art. But this is a sub for a video game. I don't care if people post it here, because it's not against the rules of the sub, but there's nothing you can say to convince me that player created art is relevant to the game, because it's not. Banksy could tag his Mesmer on the side of the Empire State Building. Sure, it's cool, but it's still not relevant to playing the goddamn game. Therefore, there will always be people who don't care to see stuff like that on the sub. And a filter is a pretty easy way to do that without ruining anyone's experience. 
---
This. I don't play more WvW or PvP than I can help, because I get frustrated too easily by dying. I've gotten mine - as well as some dungeon armor - by heading out and doing Master of Monuments, Land Claimer, and Veteran Slayer when available. Those are the least likely to get you ganked.
---
Veteran events when it's the daily are typically considered neutral ground and I often see people from multiple servers calmly wait to get hits in and then leave when done. Few people bother defending ruins, so you can usually just glide down to one and get it done in two minutes if your server holds a garrison somewhere. Land Claimer takes a little bit longer and is a bit riskier, but it's within my frustration threshold to deal with, haha.
---
Ok thanks, that’s what happens when I follow the GW2Efficiency shopping list instead of just the crafting steps.
---
Yes, excellent examples! The thematic is exceptional, they really hit that out of the park. I turned mine into a Valkyrie of sorts, chasing down and capturing the best-of-the-best warriors and most fearsome monsters to bring with her back to the Mists, where they'd battle in glorious eternal conflict forever (though, she doesn't run Valkyrie gear lol). The big game hunter theme is solid, it's that the weapon could use some touch-ups to feel a bit more impactful
---
Tomorrow you'll be making a delivery to Ebola 9, the virus planet.
---
&gt; But hey, it's still better than the Claw of the Khan-Ur 
---
As someone who build it: Dunno why you think that, I like that one. I don't need  "IN YA FACE"-effect weapons.
---
Every single group comp has a warrior in it, they bring top tier buffs and decent dps 
---
I think it's the fact that most people never lay flat on their sides: shoulders get in the way, or there's a pillow that causes a slight curve either way.. Charr don't exactly have that problem. Adorable, though!
---
...and that is all that matters.
---
Even the aura and footfalls are better.
---
I don't see much of a point to that since most accomplishments are account-wide. I would love a race change though, idk why there isn't one considering there's no race-locked professions.
---
Why can't they go today?
---
T4 Fracs without Ascended armor seems a bit compromising doesn t it? Also,200g? In what universe is a full set of Vipers 200g? Assuming you buy everything and don t farm your life out,that is.
---
I wrote it on phone and i don’t see problem with writing u instead of you . If you have nothing to say about the topic then gtfo . 
---
It really fucking doesn't look like the chaos bow though. You people are blind.
---
The wiki is your friend, especially when crafting Legendary items.
---
Very cool video jazzzz!! Love this kind of (i think celtic) music. 
---
Except you're not paying just for the skin, but also the bonus features of legendaries (swapping stats, infusions, runes, and sigils freely).
---
If you don't like it, make the less expensive Kudzu. Simple as that.
---
Yo man, just so you know your PC should be able to push 35-40+ FPS in (very) large scale WvW fights. The only thing I notice about your setup is your CPU (always a bottle neck). You should be able to run 1440p because gw2 uses fuck all for GPU, even when running a 21:9 ultrawide. 
---
Go into settings and turn character models and number of character models (forget exact name) down to medium or low. This will massively increase your fps. Make sure you’re rendering at NATIVE resolution, not the supersample or w/e. 
---
Your hardware is solid, just tweak your ingame settings. 
---
You should reread it . 
---
I expected a charr.
---
FFXIV devs said something like this too... I wonder if it's actually that hard to pull off.
---
big thx &lt;3 im happy you like it!
---
https://imgur.com/a/IkmdidM
---
&gt; Seriously - I have to wonder if people wanted The Shining Bow.
---
I just wanted Storm Bow.
---
Your English needs more work than the bow.
---
I'm just not a fan of autoattack skills that stick to the enemy while channeling, like Spatial Surge.
---
You could do this with any legendary tbh.
---
"Take random plank/surfboard, add (day/night/both) sky texture to it. Congrats, you made a Legendary Greatsword!"
---
I like Kudzu better for the more color variation without being obnoxious. 
---
Thank you! I'll be here all week.
---
We're gonna have to wait until guild wars 3 if we wanna see any of that stuff. For now, more elite specs.
---
&gt;This is also true in raids, where you have to actually dodge things and play actively, instead if standing in a safe spot and wailing on the boss while staring at your agro meter and staying below the tank.
---
When I played GW2 forever ago, I remember the big boss fights just being zerg fests though. Like you could follow the mechanics, or you could just keep dying and throwing bodies at the giant dragon until it died. I'm considering a jump back into GW2, but this was one of my big peeves with GW2 content. 
---
Opinions differ. I like your take on earth and water, though they seem very same.
---
Grind for money to make legendary...convert the gold to gem...buy from gem store. End result is the same. You get what you want.
---
Nobody is forcing you to make a legendary...nor to spend $ on a skin.
---
What's the current state of the game?  I've been gone for over a year, having left shortly after I finished PoF's main story.  I'm curious what's what since that time.  Here's a few more questions to guide what I'm really looking for:
---
* Has there been any power creep / has the gear treadmill moved?
---
* How friendly is the game to casuals interested in Fractals / Dungeons / Raiding (I haven't done fractals since some time in HoT and haven't ever raided)?
---
* How well balanced is the game for casual match-made PVP?
---
* Is there a good mechanism built into the game for finding newbie friendly groups for dungeons / fractals?
---
* Is the tank / heal / deal trinity still absent?
---
* What are daily activities like right now / how long to complete a round on a single character?
---
* I quit because I got burned out from trying to do all the daily content on every character I had (1 of each class), is that behavior still encouraged?
---
Thanks in advance.
---
Horrible game design, sorry. Auto-attacks should never be this complicated. This is absurdly convoluted and would work better as a profession mechanic instead of a weapon auto.
---
Thank you for assuming my thoughts and tastes, you can now go rest with a sense of pride and accomplishment, knowing that you protected the poor designers of Fashion Wars 2 from another bully and made sure that they can keep funneling all their creativity into cashstore and lootbox skins.
---
That’s like world bosses.  Raid bosses are 10-man instanced and you can’t respawn or get rezzed if you’re full dead.
---
Just reading through GW2 Reddit: In particular - https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2swz3b/most_profitable_use_for_bandit_crests/cntr9wk/
---
This is kinda co-inside with my findings over time, I am just sticking with Bags of Stolen Goods, cause other options are extremely boring. Off-cause this is all speculative, based on limited sampling and ymmv.
---
Same thing happened with equinox skins... Ye, black and white theme is no news. It’s a fucking white glowing longbow, get over it and stop it with the brainless comparisons. The curve, effect, string, all of it really is different from chaos. 
---
I have absolutely no idea what a poddle is but it sounds hilarious! 
---
 &gt; Or another scepter that has a flying snake with it, or another book that hovers in front of you menacingly.
---
 &gt; So your issue is that it doesn't have a pet? Or that your hand doesn't become a (in my own opinion) gaudy DMC looking thing when equipping it?
---
Where is the assumption in what you said to what I countered?
---
If you think about it, Kralk might just be an overgrown flounder.
---
Oh man, I am way out of the loop then; I assumed it kept going until next week. I'm sorry!
---
You should make a guide on how to be a funnyman
---
&gt;Has there been any power creep / has the gear treadmill moved?
---
There has never been a gear treadmill in this game. Ascended is still BiS.
---
&gt;Is there a good mechanism built into the game for finding newbie friendly groups for dungeons / fractals?
---
There is a LFG tool and often groups will put in the description that they are newbie friendly.
---
&gt;Is the tank / heal / deal trinity still absent?
---
Yes. The meta revolves around support for heals and boons and DPS. There are no tanks in the traditional sense.
---
&gt;I quit because I got burned out from trying to do all the daily content on every character I had (1 of each class), is that behavior still encouraged?
---
I don't think anything has really changed in this regard since you stopped playing, although there isn't that much benefit to completing all the daily stuff. 2 gold per day is nice, but there are plenty of ways to farm gold so it's not horrible if you skip it. It is one of the best ways to build up AP but the rewards from the AP milestone chests aren't very important. I mostly ignore the dailies and don't feel like it's hurting me.
---
&gt; End result is the same.
---
why should we even play the game? we should all just hand over monies to get everything from the gemstore good call. After all the end result is the same right?
---
You're right to assess that ANet has not put a lot into PvP, and that the reason is largely because PvE is where all their profits are. But blaming PvE players for enjoying the *primary* game mode? Lmao, grow up. The bottom line is always going to determine what the priorities are, both from ANet's perspective, and especially from that of NCSoft, who more or less have the final say in everything. And the incentives just aren't there for either of them to spend the resources on overhauling PvP, particularly when the competitive gaming scene is now dominated by eSports, which they could never hope to compete against without totally shaking up the company.
---
Obviously that sucks, since PvP is a part of the game, just a lot less developed than it could be. I really wanted to get into the PvP at some point, but given how much everyone whines about it (and it seems like it's not wholly unjustified), I probably never will. 
---
Try not to choke on all that bitterness you have inside you.
---
U have not graduated fashion wars school. This is a 0/10
---
I thought Charr were born with armor and a sword in the hand
---
Maybe if its angled just slightly to show a more "resting on its side" look. 
---
&gt;This is why the gods ~~created~~ left Tyria. 
---
&gt; Has there been any power creep / has the gear treadmill moved?
---
The gear treadmill is static as in no new tiers have been added. New prefixes/stat combinations have been added which are arguably a sideways treadmill for people who want to fine-tune their builds. 
---
&gt; How friendly is the game to casuals interested in Fractals / Dungeons / Raiding (I haven't done fractals since some time in HoT and haven't ever raided)?
---
Fractals: hop right in at T1. T2 is casual friendly. T3 is a garbage fire. 
---
Dungeons: Using the map chat or the LFG, they're still pretty casual friendly. If you want to do the story, say so in the LFG or everyone will skip it. 
---
Raids: Head over to r/guildrecruitment. The LFG raiding is somewhat unfriendly to newbies. 
---
&gt; How well balanced is the game for casual match-made PVP?
---
Usually ok, but you get people who are trying their first game and people who have 450 kills in the same match in unranked. It's worth reading a build guide or two. 
---
&gt; Is there a good mechanism built into the game for finding newbie friendly groups for dungeons / fractals?
---
I literally write things like "Relaxed fractals for friendly people" in the LFG and, well, I get relaxed and friendly people. Ask and ye shall receive. Some people just want to speed clear them and ragequit of you fail once and hopefully the word "relaxed" puts them off. 
---
&gt; Is the tank / heal / deal trinity still absent?
---
In everything except raids, yeah. Everyone welcomes a healer druid, though. Mostly tanks aren't necessary for fractals and open world. 
---
&gt; What are daily activities like right now / how long to complete a round on a single character?
---
I quit because I got burned out from trying to do all the daily content on every character I had (1 of each class), is that behavior still encouraged?
---
It's a game. Do your dailies on a character you enjoy. If you're burning out, be kinder to yourself and just do the bits you enjoy. 
---
Is there a particular reason main hand pistol is bad on thief? Genuine question, I haven't played that long and still haven't really done anything extremely difficult. 
---
I mean if we are going to go the "hey y r u so upset?" It can go both ways about you and the design, but I don't do that thing. That's my good friends design so..
---
so is TO. We're talking about ~200kp groups or 10/none btw?
---
Yes, this. For a time I worked as a volunteer programmer for servers on an open source emulator for an old MMORPG and the players generally act like entitled pricks, like the OP, about everything. Even when you give an explanation you have to go back and forth for hours on why they don't understand and how what they were doing before for easy rewards now requires some skill on the players part as well as their vast knowledge of how to balance a game (spoiler warning, they rarely know what they are talking about) and how I am doing it wrong. Even a simple "Could you post on the bug forums so I can see it when I get back home" would turn into a melodramatic amount of whining about how I wasn't doing my job and was expecting too much. In short, players that want big explanations are the whiny entitled brats that will never accept the explanation and just want to argue to get their way.
---
This is one of the most common misconceptions of new player, that hearts are like the old progression quests in other MMOs.  Once you can get them to understand that PvE is more about exploration and the hearts are just guideposts to point you to an area, the whole game opens up.
---
Wouldn't call all art posts amazing. Some people even post every single piece they do, basically just self-promoting their twitter/tumblr/whatever.
---
I'd like to see an update to longbow on ranger as well. Longbow is basically useless in PvE outside of open world and low level fractals. What's the point of a ranger who can barely use range?
---
Welp your friend made a bland looking legendary, better luck next time?
---
What game do you develop for?
---
Auto attack is complete garbage, stealth attack is overly underwhelming in regards to current standards, and pistol 2 is a complete joke.
---
The weapon doesn't know what it wants to be.
---
Gem store skin with footfalls and a sound effect.
---
Everytime I see some internet nerd raging on game forums DEMANDING the devs explain themselves to him I imagine a middle-aged housewive bitching at the electrician why he just used that tool and not this one, how only spinning it four times instead of six would've saved time and therefore lessen the cost for her, and calling for him to do it all without turning the electricity off because she just started washing machine before he came and doesn't want it to stop.
---
I mean, sure, he can explain things to her in a superficial way without going too much into depth and wasting his time (or patience or nerves), but now imagine her being an almaganatian of a thousand backseat electricians of the same attitude.
---
And the string?
---
You cannot deny that's innovation.
---
It's passable and i plan on crafting it.
---
Why are people so against this? If I wanted to look at art then I would enable the art filters which are hopefully being worked on. All that happens when I see it is I ignore it and downvote depending on how cringey / stupid / clearly karma whoring it is.
---
That's really badass. 
---
We're definitely facing off Kralk soon, if not now then in Ep 6. 
---
After that, Season 5, but what that'll bring is anyone's guess. Although, I think it's time we start pulling the curtain back on the Deep Sea Dragon. 
---
The Mists are an option now, and as we've seen in Jahai, Time Travel is a very real possibility now. 
---
In my very optimistic and hopeful idea for S5 we use the Mists to travel back to the end of the last Dragonrise, figure out where the DSD fell asleep then in the present we follow the trail of DSD to where ever it's hiding out now, whether it be Cantha (and I really hope it's not) or somewhere new
---
Thank you I ended up putting my name over it too which I think looks cooler :)!
---
Its all the collections that worry me. All that grinding.. Only 700gold left in mats I need. And i have the gold. 
---
Oh, shit! Really? ^^^^/s
---
If I had the money to buy it straight from the gem store do you really expect me to spend days farming map completion and finishing a lot of story steps on all 9 of my characters just to get free keys? 
---
Obviously I can't afford it. That's the WHOLE point of **farming** keys. Did you think I spent dollars on keys?
---
I'm thick headed, bro, but you really outdid yourself with that one.
---
Thanks! One more question, does it download the remainder mid game or only when I'm trying to access new areas? 
---
I think people really missed the reference on that one, judging by the down votes, lol.
---
That or the air ships themselves are downvoting.
---
In short it was a carbon copy of a tier 3 cultural armor skin, which still cost something like 129 gold for a whole set IIRC.  At that time, that was an even larger expense than now by far, and transmutation worked differently... You needed 1 skin piece and 1 stat piece every time.  Also at the time, the 800 gems or w/e the skin cost had less gems-&gt;gold value than the gold cost of the full cultural set.  
---
Even though Anet did give gem refunds, you couldn't get back your money thanks to legal games played through loopholes when dealing with gem stores (All gem stores, not just Digital River who does GW2's).  So, those who bought gems for that set got exactly what they legally paid for ("The ability to purchase services") but not the "service" they thought they were buying.

There is plenty more from both sides too but none of it is really worth reading tbh.  Anet only knee-jerks once and no matter how bad that decision ever is, that's the one they run with forevermore.  Also note that they wiped the old forums with all the stuff in them in an poorly disguised attempt to bury this kind of stuff.  
---
In spite of all, they have managed to make a pretty good game and are among the least worst offenders with gem store related stuff.  They also learned from this mess to be very careful when altering anything they already released.  So they do appear to have learned that one lesson.
---
I definitely can't...I just checked all my crafters, the wiki and dulfy. There are no guides to making an airship. If it doesn't exist there, it's not in the game.
---
This is what people mostly save their magic find for ^
---
This limited to only 16 per day? 
---
GW2Spidy says ectos haven't been at 40s since the summer of '16.  They haven't been at 30s since PoF launched.
---
That said, before Istan there was multiloot.  Before multiloot there was Silverwastes.  Before Silverwastes there were champ trains.  We've always been farming, we'll still be farming even if Istan was nerfed.
---
I remember reading a dev reply to this long time ago: They can't do it because your chosen race has an impact on your personal story and swapping race would cause things to break.
---
For some reason NA servers on this game in general just seem extremely dead compared to EU. I've used both and EU's LFG is just objectively far more active than NA. During the peak hours on NA, it's barely better if not equal to the activity level of EU's least active timeframes on the LFG from what I've observed and experienced multiple times.
---
They're just huge material (aka give me all your gold) sinks now. Mystic Tribute just screams "Here, just throw all your gold at this, that's all we want". 
---
Because devs are not always in touch with whats going on in the higher tiers of gameplay in the game.   
---
The last pvp dev to have any clue, grouch, left ages ago and he wasnt enough to keep the pvp gameplay from deteriorating into the spammy, visual, cc, condi and small but constant damage clusterfuck that it has become.  
---
This could have been stemmed with HoT and easily kept PvP in a much healthier and fun state if they had listened and discussed with the good players in the game at that point. Since then anyone and everyone serious about PvP has either left completely or basically just plays for shits and giggles barely really enjoying it.  
---
I have been playing soulbeast ranger in wvw with a longbow and it is very strong and a lot of fun. You merge with your pet a lot so you don't really need to micro it. Soulbeast is also good with a shortbow in pve for condition damage dps. Longbow isn't good in organized pve as the dps is bad, but it's good in wvw when you pop a bunch of CDs then oneshot someone with burst from super far away. It may be a bit like marksmanship Hunter. I can't say how good the build is in spvp. You can use longbow in open world pve to decent effect. 
---
Dragonhunter guardian can use longbow but it is basically the same story as ranger longbow. 
---
Shortbow is very strong for farming on a thief but not strong as a primary weapon. 
---
The other classes that use a bow are renegade revenant (shortbow) and berserker warrior (longbow). Renegade makes good use of the SB and is a super strong condition damage DPS class, but not so great in pvp. Berserker is super meta in raids and organized pve and uses a longbow mainly to lay down fire fields and such with burning arrows. It is also not super strong in pvp that I know of. 
---
Part of the problem of using a bow in pvp is that projectile reflect or projectile destroy is a thing, so if you aren't careful when shooting into a group of enemies, you may end up just killing yourself. Reflects are super common. This, ranged projectile classes tend to be tough to play or not meta. 
---
Let me know if you have any specific questions about a class I mentioned or just check out metabattle.
---
Well, you did seem to whine about HAVING to get lucky on drops to get the skin, which is obviously not the case. It is of course also worth pointing out that you could use the statuettes to get gold and trade that gold to gems and get the skin that way.
---
Seems silly to whine about drop rate of an item just because you don't want to/"can't" get it the other way. 
---
The creature named chests that come from the  WvW and sPvP reward tracks are also magic find sensitive. The wiki mentions this in the Magic Find page, but nowhere else.
---
I don't even do FotM very often and I agree with this.  Sadly, they did extremely well with this during LS1, but the temporary nature of that content meant that evidence of it never persisted.  They finally hit their stride with it in permanent in the second half of LS3 IMO.
---
I believe you should be able to force a map to load if it hasn't loaded and you try to enter it. You can make it prioritize that new map first.
---
I usually play on all settings high and character limit in the middle. Turning off shadows and relfections took alot of load off the cpu. 
---
Can't Agre more sadly. I really want a longbow that is big , massive and screams, deadly bow.. Sadly Fore-breating Longbow is the only one that has that effect and i expected sometihng similar from a future bow. I guess its my taste only on this matter. But the current bows, most feel like a stick that would break, this one doesn't change the feeling.
---
My Manwich!
---
It's not like theres really anything else posted that's video game related besides art. Sometimes people just post videos of flying around. Or really bad memey videos that rarely get upvoted. Whenever cmaj or rotation builds come up, they get to the front page. Art just means it's a slow week because nobody else posted something interesting that we dont know about yet. Art is not bad content fillers for the subreddit or else it will seem dead without it.
---
It's odd.  Every so often they put a nice track in the story episodes and then proceed to never use it anywhere else.  I suppose they're tailored to be evocative of specific moments or motifs, but it's a little disappointing sometimes. 
---
Its a tragedy of a commons issue. The economic balance of liquidity and assets only holds value as you try to take more and more of it, which forces others to also try and get more and more of it. Those who recognize this are in Istan farming, killing the global game economy (or at least fundamentally shifting it).
---
it was on sale on so many sites....
---
Have 3 friends that got turned off by the leveling through hearts. Tried to convince to wait, they never hit lvl 30 lol.
---
No sleep deprivation on my part and thought it looked like the cookie monster too. 
---
So no megathread then, just a filter option, and require fan art posts to be tagged, so we can opt out of seeing them. 
---
Whenever I'm doing this, I try to keep a to-scale image of my UI under it, as if it were a full screenshot, to make sure it all lines up.
---
Do you have anything like that? Might help confirm contrast and transparency.
---
It's a really popular style right now, looks sharp.
---
Felicia day 😁
---
Imagine waiting for a good gen2 dagger and getting claw
---
yeah, saw him too. Name is Mase or something like that. Plays only Renegade. 
---
No it's not, because their artwork is the advertisement in itself. Customers show up on their own volition.
---
Which is odd, because it's something that was implemented into the original game. Considering they're on the same engine, I would think the capability would be there. Probably just not enough of a reason to go back and do it after 6+ years.
---
Both. The game is worth far more than $30. The amount of entertainment it provides far exceeds the cost involved.
---
In GW2 Expansions never get outdated because we have the same maxlevel as we always had and will keep on having. So you never grow out of a expansions because of it. So if you want to be a part of the whole game then you need to buy both.
---
You can't really buy the base game any more; buying an expansion will remove restrictions from your account.
---
Either expansion gives you access to Rev, but each has different Elite Specs for every class.  Plus different maps, story, masteries, raids, rewards, skins, stat combinations, etc.
---
If $30 is within your budget, you would be best off getting both.
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
Literally on sale on Amazon for like 15 bucks for a week. The official website normally doesn’t do sales.
---
It's an honestly elegant and shiny design, definitely the longbow for legendary armor wearing chars
---
The ritualist in the next expansion
---
From the look of things, so has Anet. 
---
Because Raiders accept people with no KP and Exotic gear :^)
---
Also,T3 is also off charts for people with no LS episodes.
---
Don't defend this game s grind,its not really defendable.
---
Some people enjoy working towards a goal instead of swiping your credit card, why call them boring if they enjoy it? 
---
I once did just this! I fused Celestial with Winter’s Heart infusion to lighten it, and it went nicely on zodiac pieces. Let me see if I can’t find the SS.
---
All I really want is the animation on Air #1 to be the same as Mesmer's scepter 3, but holding the scepter instead of it floating a foot out of reach...
---
New Living World episodes every few weeks. L O L This guy is a comedian.
---
You just missed a ton of sales.
---
Dyeing weapons is easy when there's 12 dyes and only specific weapons can be dyed, and only in specific places.
---
It's another thing entirely when there are 560 different dyes over 3,000 weapon skins.

Oh, wow. I did not expect that kind of write-up. And GOOD LORD I did NOT expect that amount of work being put in the game! I thought it's more like SW:TOR. A hollow flesh puppet full of the publisher's cum, being shoved down poor people's throat.
---
And thanks for not spoiling the story, much appreciated. ;)
---
I'm actually checking if my ten year old account still exists...
---
So I absolutely love the way the starter armor looks so is there a way I can keep the look while freely changing my armor?
---
Polyluminescent can be combo with every infusion except itself.
---
Skin change like Snow Diamond, Ember and Celestial cannot stack.
---
I currently didnt have access to my GW2, sorry but I experiment a lot about those infusion. You could combo Snow Diamond with Polyluminescent to get skin color similar to Chest Skin. But the skin and Chest, the color will be the one of Polyluminescent and it effect all other gear colors.
---
But where's Blish 😥
---
Honestly, I want exactly what the arcdps one is... but in the game. I want to be able to save files (since stats are static and don’t change) that are like “berserker xyz pieces in abc slots, etc etc” that we can send to people, and have them be able to just load it, like gw1 skill templates were. 
---
If you buy both expansions and both Living Story episode packs (gemstore), you get 6+ years of content for ~65€.
---
You can buy the episodes for gold, too, but it'd take around 1200 gold to get them all. You CAN skip on Season 2 to lower the price tag, if you want to. It provides nothing but content and lore but no important rewards or anything, and is significantly lower quality than season 3 or 4.
---
Akili is mostly just filler event, you don't really get that much from champ bags.

---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.
---
I refuse to pump any additional money into product with quests, instances and dungeons broken and unfixed since day1.

I actually can't go back to the old ways now... Guild Wars' heart system has broken me for other games :P
