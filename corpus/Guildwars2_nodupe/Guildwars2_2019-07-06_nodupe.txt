Their are some ascended weapons you can’t salvage either. The Caladbolg one I think? I ran into this issue as well.

As someone who's been hunting this for a long time.

Please let there be a way to make it in the forge or at least tradeable.

It's so hard for me to get people together to do the event in the first place.

Ur gay

Can't every Condi spec theoretically do this, though?
---
Woah wait, did she paint this?
---
The fractals intro says “ fragments of history from the aether” , as I cant find any lore to what the aether actually is I figured it’s a by product of the scarlets war. But since it’s just an assumption you might be right
---
The mention of mounts had me thinking of a Battletoads-esque "avoid hitting the approaching walls" stage.
---
The patience. The patience is what I’m missing but I want my pretty picture NOWWWWW
---
Yeah let's worry about LA when literally the rest of the game has gone neglected. When are dungeons going to get a rework, when are we getting build templates? There's a hundred other things that actually matter that haven't been acted upon that we should be more worried about first before we focus on a city zone that is already lost to bad design choice in the first place. In fact, I think that might be the issue in all honesty, is that the bad design choice prevented anet from working on the zone any further. Well, if the players don't like it, why even bother doing anything else with it?
---
By varnish, do you mean masking fluid? I recently got some but it was so expensive I don’t want to waste it.. @__@;;
---
Using the brown is such a good tip!! I’ll definitely have to try it out. Thanks!
---
Nothing ever changes anymore. No existing zones are modified, only new zones are created.
---
Sure you might get a few different spawns at certain times of year, but that's it. 
---
And I remain bitter about it.
---
Well on the Sylvari story, it was worst when LA was rebuilt, and people didn't really know about the connection between the Sylvari and Mordremoth. 
---
Core zones are generally locked in time. Always have been. They might remake a zone like Kessex, then it's locked in that time. They Sylvari story actually does play out...it plays out in Heart of Thorns.
---
Just as you enter Orr and we haven't defeated Zhaitan  yet, you're at the same time frame in LA. 
---
With Mordremoth dead, the reason to fear Sylvari has mostly passed, and only a few will continue to hold onto those negative feelings. Particularly since Trahearne died, basically, a hero.
---
Thanks I hate it.
---
&gt;When are dungeons going to get a rework
---
Never, because they were already announced as having dropped support years ago. You may not agree with it, many players haven't over the years, but if you want a proper gripe then look to fractals (or raids) which are still supposed to be supported.
---
&gt; when are we getting build templates 
---
[Whenever they're ready.](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/)
---
People absolutely did know about the connection between Sylvari and Mordremoth. There isn't an in-game time-skip in between the end of LS2 and HoT. The violence against Sylvari is specifically *because* the general public sees the Sylvari as a threat from Mordremoth.   
---
LS2 happens (sylvari blows up zephyrites, Scarlet backstory, Caithe/Wynne's history. AKA Mordremoth is a thing.) -&gt; Pact Fleet is destroyed in part due to Mordremoth taking control of a large majority of Sylvari during the first forays into the Maguuma Jungle -&gt; Lion's Arch is rebuilt -&gt; Events of Heart of Thorns happen.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
While yes, we're now long past that part of the story, it is still incredibly regrettable, especially considering how much was cut from HoT.
---
Hey! Sorry for the super late reply! Hmm from what you mentioned it seems the healbrand is the better support if I want to carry the team. But I'll probably do T4s with my Condi quickbrand friend who doesn't plan on going heals at all :(
---
So I'm guessing the only option now for me is to create two armor sets? 1 diviner + pack runes aRene and the other harrier heal Rene.
---
Also I've read your amazing write-ups on how to heal with the healbrand, any chance if you have some tips for a heal Rene?
---
Dude, I'm as bitter against Anet as anyone here, as an old member of the dungeon community and as a current member of the raid/fractal community. While I don't like it, nothing we say, no matter how much we complain, will bring dungeons back. They've said time and time again that the code is just too old/confusing to be worth the effort in bringing them back. Yeah, it's absolutely a testament to their weakness as a company, but Anet's MO for YEARS has been "spend a lot of resources to introduce cool system, stop support for it to work on new cool system."  
---
It's the plain truth that **dungeons are not coming back.**
---
I didn't realize this item was so rare, I got it on my first kill yesterday :o
---
How get this tonic?
---
No, people didn't know. We knew. They didn't know until the beginning of HOT when the Sylvari turned, which was during the invasion of the jungle, AFTER LA had been rebuilt. So if LA is locked in time, people didn't know prior to that. WE knew because of what we learned during the events of Living World Season 2.  People didn't know. 
---
Presumably we didn't run around screaming this info at the top of our lungs, due to what it would to to the Sylvari over all. We learned the Pale Mother protected the Sylvari from Mordremoth's influence, but the connection wasn't know. It was a closely guarded secret that one Sylvari died to keep from Faolin.
---
Not everything added to the game is meant to be solved by the player. That "murder mystery" you constantly refer to is one of them, it's actually the **end** of a small sideplot that began with people bashing Scarlet and thus sylvari ever since LA's destruction. There were multiple dialogues in still-destroyed LA that referred to how sylvari were being harassed and abused, and this ultimately culminated in murders and honest merchants becoming messenger boys for black market dealings in remade LA.
---
This is similar to the murder investigation in DR that's been going on for years. It's not *meant* to go anywhere, and neither is the scaffolding at LA's entrance.
---
Regarding the dropped threads from HoT - in all honesty, Season 3 was the ideal time to tackle those after HoT, but aside from Malyck and how the Pale Tree got purified, the time for them has come and gone and we won't ever see them fulfilled because they're dropped.
---
Actually both events took place in 1328 AE according to the timeline. one of those events took place in the jungle, and the ships on which is happened crashed. The odds are that no one in Lion's Arch at the time of the rebuilding learned about it.  LA was destroyed when Scarlet attacked in Season 1.  It was rebuilt during Season 2. THere's no reason to believe that the Sylvari mordremonth connection was known before at all.
---
More to the point, doesn't matter how long it's been, older zones ARE locked in time. When you walk around Orr NPCs are still talking about the invasion against Modremoth. There are many things in the game that are locked in time. The Silverwastes is all about preparing to invade the jungle, before we ever enter it. Dry Top is all about the Zephyrites crashing due to sabotage. It doesn't change...and Lion's Arch doesn't either unless the change is part of the story.
---
Kessex Hills is polluted since we brought down the nightmare tower and it's locked in that time. That's how the game has always worked.
---
Kiel didn't design new LA. The Captain's Council as a whole gathered a bunch of designers, and picked one. They contracted the Consortium to rebuild LA, and the Consortium purchased most materials from the Black Lion Trading Company.
---
New LA would be the way it is whether Kiel or Evon won. The thing the election ultimately decided in regards to LA's fate is the number of casualties. We were told that had Evon won, he would have put his own resources into LA's defenses (whereas Kiel could only try to convince the council, which Evon tried to do too, and it failed), which would have resulted in fewer casualties but LA would still have been devastated and need rebuilding.
---
It was added with the mastery system, so HoT.
---
I mean, the HoT trailer thingy at the end of LWS2 also shows Faolion fighting both the Seraph and the Mordrem, and as we all know, Faolion never got the character development she deserved.
---
&gt;People absolutely did know about the connection between Sylvari and Mordremoth. There isn't an in-game time-skip in between the end of LS2 and HoT. The violence against Sylvari is specifically *because* the general public sees the Sylvari as a threat from Mordremoth.
---
This is incorrect. Firstly, there was a time gap between Season 2's finale and HoT. During this gap, the Mordrem Invasions occurred as did LA's reconstruction finish.
---
Secondly, the public opinion against sylvari in LA was formed by Scarlet. There are multiple dialogues from destroyed LA which reflected this. Sylvari were abused and profiled like crazy by several LA citizens who lost people to Scarlet. They blamed all sylvari for Scarlet's actions.
---
Wow! I saw a few of the mobile job listings, didn't know the count was that high.
---
Also, join a social guild. I love spending hours just chatting with my guildies.
---
Disclaimer, you can't craft a precursor on a F2P account. You'd have to get your precursor via drop, mystic forge, or the TP. Actually the TP might be restricted as well.
---
Just get a bunch of guilds together to cycle through Guild World Event spawns!
---
I don't I think elite specs are a perfect modern alternative to this. I think secondary professions would have been a better thing before elite specs were a thing because what are you asking for a r/N get all the elite specs for those classes as well so you could have Soulbeast/Necro or Ranger/Reaper. What would balance be like with that. I'm not saying secondary professions are a horrible idea I'm saying would it work with Elite specs.
---
Do you guys think this is a prelude to having secondary classes in the next expansion or episodes?
---
Anyone know if the skills use any trait interaction or is it just a base ability?
---
I mean, you're not wrong. But that doesn't change the fact that the collective playerbase opening coffers won't flood the market if only a theoretical 1 in 300,000 will drop the infusion. There'll only be a couple dozen a year given that dragon coffers are so much harder to farm compared to, say, trick or treat bags.
---
I want both elite specs and secondary professions. 
---
Though, if having both is considered OP, then I can tolerate using a secondary class instead of an elite spec.
---
How do the rev abilities work? Cant log in now.
---
Just say "uwu" in map chat, it always works for me to break the ice
---
&gt; t3 fracs is really like .001 rolls.
---
Seems like you have no idea about the drop rates and think 0.001% is exorbitantly low.
---
First thing: T4 fracs absolutely don't have a 10% chance. 
---
2nd thing: T3 chests even has a higher chance to drop ascended armor stuff than T4 chests. 
---
Also as you can see in the loot tables of [T4 Chests](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractal_Master%27s_Chest), [T3 Chests](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractal_Expert%27s_Chest), [T2 Chests](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractal_Adept%27s_Chest] and [T1 Chests](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractal_Initiate%27s_Chest) the T4 daily chests only drop glover, boots and shoulders chests in a better category (uncommon), rest is rare as at the other chests. 
---
Also you can look at the drop research. T4 has a chance of 0.01% for a glover/shoulder/boots chest and also 0.01% for a coat/leggings helmet chest. T3 on the other hand has a 0.02% chance for all chests.
---
Those "small" numbers are pretty normal rates and even though there are people with 6 chests from one daily run. 
---
However, in raids it's even worse. It's not only that the rate is 7 times lower only because of the weekly timegate instead of daily. The already low rate of the armor chests compete with several single weapon drops at every boss. While a boss can drop 0-1 armor chest, it also can drop 10-40 weapons/trinkets.
---
TLDR; It's actually easier to get ascended armor chests from T3 (and T2) than from T4. Also both rates are enormously higher than raids, just because of the daily instead of weekly timegate.
---
That necro bar is actually not bad for zerging
---
To be fair, not a damn thing got the plot development it deserved in HoT.
---
Really interested in trying my Reaper with the Guard skills. Reaper with JI, Purging Flames, and Feel my Wrath seems like it could be fun. Plus Sanctuary for the range heat or blocking someone trying to get away. ^ u ^
---
Bullshit. It's 5600+ points. The people that are "top ranked" ( your term ) absolutely have those points. Because if they didn't they wouldn't be at the top, which is around 41k out of a possible 42 k-ish . ( off the top of my head , without looking)
---
Wait is it on now?
---
Currently the best spots are the Silverwastes and Dragonfall. Always make sure to do your dailies for a free 2g, and once you get into fractals and raids, they’re great gph with a good group, although they’re gated daily and weekly respectively. Silverwastes can be min/maxed to about 20g per hour and Dragonfall can be min/maxed to about 30g per hour. As much as it sucks, the best farm in the game by far is to work a few hours at minimum wage and buy gems to convert to gold. Working at federal minimum wage in the United States is 141g per hour, so you choose how you want to spend your time.
---
TL;DR: best gph is get a job, if you want to play the game go to Silverwastes and Dragonfall, and do your dailies.
---
FYI when they do a sale , they almost always say "sale on POF" . So POF is 50% off. What they don't point out is that if you BUNDLE HOT and POF , you get -50% on both. BUT if you already have POF , you can't get just HOT for a discount. You must bundle it. This is how it is through the official Anet link , the other approved retailers have their own policies , I believe.
---
Unfortunately that is the downside - Great idea in theory but way above what Arenanet is capable of balancing.

Hihi! Sorry for the late response, I've been slowly getting through all the comments x.x I responded to someone else with a similar question, so I'll just copy paste that here so you can get the notification \\o/
---
Seems like if you get a rev orb as a rev it would be wise to switch off dwarf if you're running it while you have it. You'd basically gain a third legend, no?
---
It might — and I should stress that there is no evidence for it beyond wishful thinking — MIGHT be a concept test to test the waters both for player reaction and balance purposes. They might pursue it further if everything goes well but I highly doubt anything is currently in the works.
---
1x Crystal Infusion of Power in 50,000 dragon coffers!?!? Man that's bad odds... I tried with a couple thousand coffers and got nothing worthy in return either, and that cost me around 900 gold. It just goes to show that these types of coffers and chests really aren't worth opening. I highly doubt Anet's ever going to change it, but the fact that the odds of getting anything good is so atrocious, that it completely destroys any desire to open them anymore, in my opinion. I'm sure I'm not the only one that feels this way.
---
Adding on to this that gen 1s can be made with just the core game, but you'll have to buy the precursor off the TP\* or get lucky w a drop or the forge, because precursor crafting is tied to the mastery system. (Also, some might have specific steps that could require expansion material, for example to craft Legend you need to get caught in a chak's laser beam, and chak are only in HoT content and one specific LS4 episode, so you'd need either HoT, or PoF AND LS4 episode 4 for that.) 
---
\*Also, I think F2P restrictions would prevent you from buying the precursor off the TP, but if you owned the payed version of the base game from pre-HoT you wouldn't have that problem.
---
What makes you think a significant percentage of the game's populations did dungeons as anything more than just a fast way to get gold (which is now replaced by Fractals)? 
---
I mean they redid the bosses in AC at one point and replaced a path of TA with a much better path, but I don't believe that path received much traction.
---
Do more people do dungeons or world bosses? Dungeons or open world metas? That's a question to ask because I'm pretty sure if dungeons were massively popular, Anet would have stuck with them are added new ones.
---
Do you know what effort is? The amount of time spent doing monotonous or abnormally expensive achievements that reward few points is significantly more than the effort they've put into season 1 points, despite the points being so much higher.
---
That's actually pretty cool. Seems like a lot you could do with it with enough practice.
---
Sometimes (outside of festival time) when I go to Hoelbrak for daily gathering, I hear local denizens talk about a big hole in the west ward of Divinity's Reach...
---
I honestly think having access to even mediocre skills is still pretty strong. I wouldn't underestimate having 5 more skills than normal at the push of a button. It will be interesting to see how this all pans out!
---
Human female thief
---
Crash warbandicoot
---
Oh. I thought it was because all of the services were only available in one place, so nearly every player in the map would be standing together and complaining about low frame rates.
---
So.. you blame ArenaNet for not forcing players to stay on a server?
---
Clearly the majority of the players didn't give a shit about the server and took the first opportunity to move to another one. Don't really see why you would blame ArenaNet for that.
---
it's a normal tonic
---
That was 'cause it was tied to the Winter's Presence shoulders... and originally, that wasn't the case. There was an outcry at the time which resulted in the achieve being shifted from Festivals to the category it is in now (social?).

Of course more people seeing the content is good, and finding your own level of play is fine, but it does have to scale like fractals do, where the higher “tier” you play at, the more rewards you get. Fractals are such an excellent system that should be projected onto more areas of the game imo
---
Thxfor answer. Can you also explain this. Why snowcrows offers then take rune of thief instead power based runes on power quickbrand? Som3thing like scholar or even infiltration rune. Wouldn't it be bettervsimply run grieving armor on power quickbrand?
---
I don't think it's a balance issue. It's a design issue. Secondary professions were very gimmicky and 99% of combinations very beyond awful. There were also huge problems with class fantasy (professions didn't most optimally play as they were designed) and often you would play a ranger or an assassin and simply didn't feel like a ranger or an assassin.
---
A big part of the reason for the way GW2's professions are built the way they are (requires a heal, requires an elite, first five skills based on weapons) was to create a baseline for class fantasy (this is how a ranger would use a greatsword vs how a warrior would use a greatsword) and to prevent bad builds (too many combinations in GW1 simply didn't make sense and the vast majority of people ended up running gimmicky premade builds).
---
Secondary professions were wildly popular with a minority of the community for their theory crafting value, everyone else was just copying build templates or recreating slight variations of the same monk build.
---
The remark about Thief isn’t necessarily true.
---
Deadeye is 33333333333333

So I recently returned to the game from a very long break — over a year. I missed a Valentine’s Day Item, the “Wings of Love” glider, and I was wondering if someone could tell me if the gemstore brings back items off-season? Or do I have to wait until next Valentine’s Day before I can obtain these wings?
---
Logged in and out, that indeed did the trick, ty
---
I don't think so.
---
"Unlocking" skills to a certain, other, profession is a very different thing than making it possible to have a secondary profession.
---
GW2, in its core, is not designed to handle two professions and it could get worse if you think of what combinations you could possibly come up with. Necro/Warrior? Guardian/Mesmer? Thief/Mesmer?
---
IIRC that was the whole point of having only one profession in GW2 instead of dual-profession as they had in GW1 because they couldn't balance the skills fast or well enough. It was also a lot of headaches to do so especially if you have to balance skills over multiple game modes.
---
The "first signs of hardship" were there months ago and it became pretty obvious that Kodash hardly had the population to stand against server links, even the weakest ones like Jade Sea + whatever server it was. This relinking should have killed EU T5, since it was obvious before the link that all three unlinked servers could not compete with the rest. Instead, ANet did the language-mixing stuff and consigned Kodash to another two months of bad WvW.
---
I can perfectly understand the people who were fed up with this and left. Personally, I would never comtemplate spending gems to reward ANet for their crappy work by switching servers, so I'll probably just ignore WvW, at least until the next relink.
---
These are so beautiful. Seeing these made my morning. Thank you OP for sharing these with us!
---
They sell plenty of hoodies and t shirts too? To be honest I'm excited at the thought that maybe we will get some nice womenswear for once instead of just man t shirts.
---
We need a link in the sidebar just for these specific HoM posts lol
---
Power is much better on well, power favored bosses such as Sloth, Sam, KC, etc. Not only due to its frontloaded burst damage but also sharing Bane Signet to its allies for even more burst. Meanwhile Condi FB doesn't really get the advantage of many condi builds by having torment/confusion, just burning.
---
BUT Wings 1 and 2 your F1 tome can be reset by adds leading to a massive dps increase, and on all fights permeating wrath can significantly increase your damage if adds are present. In almost all pug scenarios and average-below average statics I would run the condi variant on nearly every fight except like KC or CA. You need good dps players and good phase times to really make the power variant shine.
---
Every map is frozen at a specific moment at the timeline. There are exceptions, of course, that some NPCs talk about recent things like the one Asura we had to talk to for the current event and so on.
---
But generally, the maps are frozen and don't really progress or get adjusted. With that in mind, I think, it is easier to understand that they don't bring those maps up to date because that would mean that they have to constantly update those maps over and over.
---
Hi Dornsinger, How can some items be replaced if a Guild was accidentally deleted but the more expensive ones cannot be found by support team? Particularly skins if they were purchased from Trading Post.
---
*CRASH! COCO! STOLE THE PRETTY CRYSTALS!*
---
I have my general suggestions on abilities and some and links to more detailed posts in my [WvW section here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#WvW_2), specifically the posts [here](https://redd.it/at45ka) and [here](https://redd.it/at3k7q). [Vabbi](http://builds.vabbi.org/) also has guides, builds and general info on their site though it is almost entirely focused on large group comps. Metabattle also has some [guides on WvW](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guides#WvW) and their own [WvW build section](https://metabattle.com/wiki/WvW).
---
Wow thank you. I’m defenetly are going to look into that!
---
I highly recommend a Diviner Amulet + Rings at minimum.
---
Most likely will be, just wait for it.
---
just like snowcrows. ok then time to work on them on DF map
---
Whether you need boon duration or not depends on your group dps/phase time and your team composition.
---
If you have good dps and a chrono with soi you don't need any boon duration, you also run renegade runes instead of firebrand runes on condi firebrand.
---
I believe snowcrows recommends some boon duration on both power and condi quickbrand which is recommended in any non-high-end group.
---
If i were you i would get some diviner trinkets as they are easy to switch out in case you don't need the extra boon duration.
---
In times of mega servers, what even *is* a full server? WvW has a player per map limit anyway.
---
are you still believing Anet doesnt only update WvW to keep its members from spam emailing mmo websites that Anet doesnt care and gw2 is dead? Aside from the warclaw WvW feels the same as it did when they introduced outnumbered and the relics in the middle of alpine for capture.
---
Please reread my post. I addressed this. But let me elaborate some more if you found that insufficient.
---
The thing about racial cities is that they are fixed in time at the start of the story. They act as introductions to the world. On top of that, it's vaguely reasonable to believe that these NPCs that we always see in their respective cities aren't well-traveled and still have a narrow perspective on the world. LA is rooted midway through the story, being confusing for new players and jarringly outdated once you catch up with the story.
---
And yes, needing to constantly update every map to keep up would be ridiculous. However, I see two potential ways for ANet to address LA. One idea is to make LA the one location in the game that genuinely "lives" with the story. Much smaller scope, but it gives us a reason to be invested in this key city of the franchise. On the other hand, they can at least clean up some of the details so the city is more timeless, rather than having glaring hints to the exact moment in time that these events are supposed to be relevant.
---
You blame it all on the secondary classes, when most people couldn't spend the time just looking through a primary class skill list to be able to make a build in GW1 that didn't enjoy theory crafting. Adding the secondary class just added more skills they were not going to look at what they did.  
---
I know this because I use to theory craft and make builds for friends because they had no desire to figure out the skills, do you know how annoying explaining what eight skills do to someone? At least with the GvG teams I didn't have to do that I just had to find out who could play which class the best.  
---
Secondary professions are suppose to break the fantasy of one class becuase they are suppose to be hybrid. Playing DnD do you really think a Warrior/Mage is going to play like one or the other? The classic battle mage setup plays unlike either option so why would you expect a secondary profession not to change the class feel?
---
This should be universities.
---
I just looked at the wiki page to see what a "full server" actually means.
---
&gt; A Full world is a world with a number of active WvW players above a certain threshold.[5]
---
&gt;[5]: https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/forum/game/wuv/World-Population-Changes-Are-Coming/page/5#post5326517
---
A full server being outnumbered in every map. Anet?
---
Yeah, it happens. After almost 4 years I'm down to logging in for 5 minutes and opening a few chests. Eventually I might not even do that much. But I'm going to finally work on my Steam backlog, which will take months. 
---
Just play something else, something new, and if the GW2 itch comes back, then you can jump right in.
---
&gt;And the fact that they are not asking from feedback from the actual people who play WvW is a disgrace.
---
With all due respect, but I don't really see anything besides complaining from the WvW side of the game. No matter what happens, what is added, or what is done, it's met with complaining. At this point I wouldn't involve the WvW community either.
---
I suggest joining a discord for questions.
---
The BD listed for power FB on SC's site is actually above the bare minimum by a decent amount, though ofc play with as much as you are comfortable with.
---
Some of the gw2 dev shirts look of cool i would like something like that or wvw , catmander
---
Yes they are. Their content releases very much prove that.

i am happy and sad to see thee are moe people like me trying to get this tonni for months theu should make it tradeble or pput in the mystic forge i even helt 1 day a event to get more luck!

keep it upvoted peeeps let arenanet see we want the damn tonnic

Oh you mean like what we see about PvE and PvP? But somehow in your mind WvW is different. The only difference you can throw in is that WvW game mode been neglected for 7 years, PvP came after and then now PvE are sining the same song on the forums every day. 
---
But somehow in your mind it is different.....
---
I don't have G-Sync. I guess I could still fiddle around with Nvidia nonetheless.
---
His first question is the title which is "Cannot discover things with bronze ingots" and then a added picture. Which is what i responded too which was the fact that he had no insignias.
---
Sure but links came considerably after the megaserver, AFAIK
---
Mega servers is a PvE thing so i am uncertain what you mean by that?

"Why doesn't Anet force our fairweather players to stick it out. Fuck Anet!" -Kodash 2019

the level of detail is astonishing
---
So i got PoF and tried me on the kudzu 
---
Do i need HoT for this? Or can i craft Everything for that Weapon in the Base Game?
---
Thx 4 all the answers so far guys&lt;3
---
Why are they quiters if they aren't having fun on a dead server? And you cant have fun if you're constantly in t5, fighting outnumbered fights.
---
People are tired of Anet's linkings and transfer so they can actually experience some gameplay.
---
Your gender and human race unless you like furries then charr.
---
Because none of the changes made to wvw are suggested by players, and there's a ton of suggestions. They just come up with random shit that brings no value to game mode and usually messes up class balance, lags or population. 
---
What do you think how would players act if Anet randomly decided to introduce open world pvp in pve maps? That's exactly how wvw players feel with every change.
---
This shows that anet has no understanding or even a desire to know what wvw community wants, they simply add things to push population numbers through pvers and make reports look better.
---
Blursed Bandicoot
---
I understood that for HoT, because the main zones were totally consumed with meta events.
---
But in PoF, they gave us five massive new zones that players were calling boring/empty within, like, a couple weeks. And then they fucking added six maps on top of them instead of fleshing them out. WHY? If they were dying to make Palawadan, just have us teleport there in a story instance. Every new map splinters the player base slightly more; it's not infinitely sustainable.
---
He’s more like Crunch Bandicoot rather than Crash, from his body build.
---
Deadeye/chronomancer please. Ultimate 1200 range cancer.
---
this is what i am working on right now.
---
Spam queue ranked pvp during the pvp season and unranked during breaks. And try to win them
---
level 55 to 100 will take alot of time. You are in for a ride
---
What about the pip system and legendary backpack? Would you like it to be removed?
---
"don't give up" we are again the last position. kodasch is dead. thx arenanet
---
For the same reason why some bosses are better on power classes, while others are better on condi. If you just practice in the golem or check sc website for benchmarks then their is your mistake.
---
Why would anyone complain about extra rewards  especially if the game mode had almost none before those?
---
I don't need any of those since I got alternatives from pve, but it's not beneficial to anyone to have those removed.
---
&gt; Weekly cap is 150
---
It's actually 300, since you can convert gaeting crystals to magnetite shards
---
Thief runes are never taken for the condi damage, but for the reliable 10% damage modifier. The condi damage is incidental.
---
Eh, Engineer actually has some good ones, Elixir S and Rocketboots are good in an "oh shit" moment, AED is not a bad healing skill if youre expecting to die soon and Supply Crate is really good. Mesmer has very low utility, but Mass Invis is still kinda broken, and if you can pocket charge Mantra of Concentration then swap off of it, thats a free 2 stunbreaks that give stability. Plus, Quickness isnt the worst thing.
---
Thief is definitely super-garbage though.
---
Ranked gives 3 times the amount of rank point a custom arena game does. Rank farms were shut down years ago, there are only daily farms now.
---
If you already purchased the motherboard, ram, then any of the current intel gen cpus clocked as high as possible will do fine.
---
If you haven't bought motherboard and ram, wait day or two for Zen 2 reviews and then compare prices to intel. Keep in mind while Zen 2 has lower clocks, it is basically on par with intel's 5ghz (or so) due to high IPC.
---
Some complaints I very specifically remember were the mode itself not giving players enough of an income. it was met with reward tracks and other ways to give the players something in return. I also remember an uproar about PvE players getting to play with new mounts and WvW players not getting anything out of the current expansion. Now there is a mount and it is once again met with backlash. WvW players wanted something that other game modes got in the form of legendary armor or a backpiece. Even that ended up with complaints about bringing in PvE players. 
---
I'm not taking sides here. I'm just trying to point out that WvW is in general a negative ball of energy where instead of saying ''X is nice, but here is what would be a better suggestion'', usually we see ''X sucks, screw you arenanet''. 
---
I'll admit though this has actually been somewhat of a nice discussion despite the opposing viewpoints. I truely hope we get a nice WvW update. I enjoy WvW myself and I would like to spend more time there, but at the moment my issues with it are the same as the general WvW consensus.
---
Hopes and dreams ;-;
---
Amd will release ryzen 3000 this sunday and intel will most likely respond with pricedrops so i would wait a week or two for reviews to make a decision
---
Well said, and things might hopefully getting better for WvW but with no-communcation at all,  it hurts and doesn't feel hopeful to me. But let's wait :)
---
B/c this is such an obscure requirement just focus on getting a good CPU.
---
From what I understand i7 is mostly a computation boost (number crunching). So it'd be good for Video editing, making 3D animations, making 3D images, high statistics (MathLab). Unless you have those as hobbies or career save up with i5. (I hypothesis the only games that would benefit from i7 would be simulations that actually have 3D stuff e.g. City: Skylines with all traffic vehicles modeled and displayed.)
---
It really isn't any different from complaining about raids/fractals taking too long to release or anything pvp related. Some people just don't know that those arent tied to expansion releases and will generally ask for something shiny because general pve got new shinies.
---
Just because PoF brought mounts, doesn't mean that the new shiny in wvw had to be the mount. There were even threads about not wanting mounts when Anet teased us with an "amazing wvw update".
---
As far as I know, both pvp and wvw communities were asking for skinless legy gear so whoever complained was a random ignorant person who doesn't even follow forums/reddit and can be found literally anywhere in the game, not just wvw.
---
All other examples you mentioned were some minimal backlashes that happen everywhere, all the time and dissappear in a matter of days so I can't really justify those. However, majority of other negative stuff coming from wvw players is more than justified because a lot of good suggestions/reports end up being ignored while devs work on something that wvw doesn't really need.
---
You get teleported to this prison if you jump off rata sum and you're about to hit the ground beneath. Apparently its illegal to fly around the cube.
---
If you slide down without gliding or flying on a mount. You will most likely die on the way and your corpse will be thrown in jail regardless. The asura are serious about their rules and death won't save you.
---
If they do this, they're not going to allow a spec as a secondary class and I think it'd be best if you couldn't have an elite spec and a secondary class as there'd be too much to balance. Cut it down to just the 9 Core classes and there might be a chance it would work. Like imagine a Condition Mirage with access to Epidemic. The game would be broken.

I really wanted to see the SAB take on a classic underwater platforming. But I have since resigned all hope of that ever happening, this merely reinforces the desire to see this and the knowledge of the fact that it is not happening.
---
Also, I admit part of the reason I wanted to see this so badly is because underwater is (or was especially back around when back to school was around) such a controversial topic for rest of the game.
---
If you're just going to be playing GW2 I'd probably go with the i5. If you have multiple monitors and want to watch stuff, browse, use other applications simultaneously etc then I'd go with the i7 assuming you can afford the extra cost without stressing about it too much.
---
Having upgraded from an i5 to an i7 in the same generation the difference is noticeable only while running GW2 and other applications at the same time.

Ty
---
thats the reply I was looking for, thanks
---
Berserker gear is fine, I use it with dual wield swords (for nuking things) and staff (for cc and because I use bifrost and like the effects).
---
Remember to dodge.
---
If needed, use heal as soon as you switch legends so you don't run out of energy.
---
Switch legends as soon as you get low energy.
---
You won't be able to use every skill in each legend due to energy constraint, auto attack is fine.
---
Try all the legends: Shiro has good engage/disengage utils.  Jalis has some more defense.  Mallyx is condi so may not be as useful for you.
---
Just properly started the game this week I think I'm close to the end of the main story (in lvl 80ish areas, about to fight an Elder Dragon ) and I was wondering if there is any specific gear needed after this point?
---
I used a level 80 boost and read that the gear isn't too good, where should I start looking for better gear? The only thing I've changed is my greatsword to Cobalt because it looks awesome.
---
My plan is to start one of the expansions after completing the main story, are the stories/campaigns connected? I don't want to do PoF before HoT if I am missing part of the story but I really want those mounts though.
---
But how would that even work.
---
Which weapon skills would you have if both professions can use the same weapon ?
---
Can you chose any weapon/utility/healing/elite skill from each profession ?
---
What about profession mechanic ?
---
No
---
Not really simple. Would a soul beast running death magic buff their pet as a minion? Would everything apply also to them when merged? Could they be in beast mode and shroud at the same time? There is way too much to consider here
---
Megaservers were the right call. They might have had a few downsides, but if the population of pve maps would be a fraction of what they are today, while maintaining more instances on average that would hurt the game much more.
---
Every (PvE) condi build uses viper trinkets.
---
Sounds perfectly reasonable. ;)
---
Oh thanks for this reply, I was udner the impression that the seasons were timegated so definitely would have skipped those!
---
Just play ranked pvp, me and my friend are trying for the set, we are ~rank 90. Takes forever. Each season we get about 5-15 levels depending on how much we play.
---
I couldn't speak to any character except Logan. I would be fine with my character being confused, but they weren't :/
---
You will, keep doing the daily achievements you see on the right side of your screen.
---
Well, first off, Ascended gear isn't necessary for most high-end content.  The stat boost it gives over exotic is much lower than exotic over rare.  You should still aim for it as a long-term goal, but the only place where it's absolutely necessary is in high-level Fractals due to the Infusion slots for Agony Resistance.
---
With Silverwastes farming, people make money by selling all the crafting materials they get.  If you're depositing all your collectibles, you're going to be making a fraction of the gold that others do.  People who are devoted Silverwastes farmers also open the generic "Bags of Gear" that drop on characters around level 53, to obtain mid-level gear from them that will salvage into more valuable items like Platinum Ore, Scraps of Linen and Rugged Leather Sections.
---
But Silverwastes is far from the only place to make gold.  Right now you could just partake in Dragon Bash festivities, those will give much more than the 1 gold an hour you're getting from the Silverwastes.  Completing the Time Trial race for a gold medal each day will give you 7 Dragon Coffers, which will sell for 2 gold on the Trading Post.  That takes under two minutes to do (it requires a Roller Beetle, but you said you have all mounts... if you don't have the Roller Beetle yet, you can rent one by the race).  Ditto the Pinata bashing adventure, though that will take more practice.  Hologram Stampedes happen each fifteen minutes and give 6 Dragon Coffers each, plus extras as random drops from enemies during the event.  It might get boring, but that's a way to obtain gold that doesn't require a high skill level or good equipment.
---
Ah dang, that sucks. If I ran into them first I literally wouldn't have made this post. I'll just pretend my character heard them, thanks :)
---
The ones that have a % ?
---
Does the wiki not link to achievement points on this page or is it mobil fucking it up?
---
Death by snu snu
---
You definitely can do dungeons with Nika's gear.  There will be a learning curve, though, because you're going to be much more frail and squishy than you're used to in Berserker gear.  Make use of your dodges, and things like Greatsword 4 that block attacks, to help get around the strongest enemy attacks.
---
Adding Berserker weapons and trinkets will help, too.  You can start working towards Ascended rings by playing low-level Fractals, which give you the Pristine Fractal Relic currency that can be exchanged for Ascended-quality rings.  Finding a helpful guild is the best way to break into Fractals, and dungeons as well.
---
Yeah I think is my cellphone

I don’t want to spoil you stuff from Season 1, but (as you can see) Lion’s Arch was quite different back then. In the original quest you would find some kids playing pretending to be Destiny’s Edge, and you learn about Logan running away. Now those children are a bit hard to find in the story instance
---
Ascalonian Catacombs story mode (level 35) tells you why Logan and Rytlock are angry at each other
---
But Eir’s dialogue in Lion’s Arch makes it seem as the dungeon happens after this attempted reconciliation (which might make sense, ages ago the quests had different requisites, maybe this reconciliation happened at level 30, before the dungeon
---
Anyway. The personal story is really really bad if you compare it with came after it. Especially post path of fire, the story is much better

Do 3 of them (100%) and you'll see 10 AP. It's Daily.
---
Good points. You've convinced me! 😃
---
It's really not overkill, I had an i7 4790k before (it broke) and got an i5 4690 after that. 
---
If you have 2 or more monitors you'll notice 60 fps videos lagging while playing Gw2 and experience less fps in general.
---
It's still playable of course and you get 60+ fps in most core areas without people but in highly populated areas and in the new maps your fps will drop significantly.
---
Is there an auction house to buy them?
---
The time gate is them being free.
---
Whenever you log in, you are given the most recent episode for free right now that's S4E6. If you miss them, you have to buy them.
---
All 3 together is about the price of 1 expansion and has arguably more PvE content.

And Final Fantasy apparently.

---
With new ryzen series coming tomorrow i'd rather w8 a few more days for the third party benchmarks and reviews to come out. Cause as things are going atm there's no point going for intel unless we are talking the 9900k which is in a level of its own.
---
&gt; I don't think it's a balance issue. It's a design issue. Secondary professions were very gimmicky and 99% of combinations very beyond awful.
---
I mean a lot of our specs are beyond useless - Core is worthless outside of gimmicky situations and a lot of traitlines are untouched.
---
It's fine for things to be gimmicky but the problem with GW2 is Anet has consistantly added powercreep, without the balancing capability to keep them in line, It would be a disaster. 
---
&gt;A big part of the reason for the way GW2's professions are built the way they are..... Secondary professions were wildly popular with a minority of the community for their theory crafting value, everyone else was just copying build templates or recreating slight variations of the same build.
---
Sounds exactly what people do here anyway. Beyond the first year nobody bothered with making their own build.
---
It's just metabattle - &gt; copy -&gt; paste.
---
That is insane
---
was looking for a new MMO after burning out on MOBA Games, started playing gw2 and instantly loved it. Especially the fluidity of the combat is what got me hooked onto the game. 
---
Also EU Player here, thank you for doing this!
---
EU here - Not for me but a friend who I recently tempted back with mounts.
---
Unfortunately hes waiting till August to see if a sale comes, This would  drag him back on earlier!
---
I'll take one :)
---
I had no idea what MMORPGs were until GW2, so what caught my eye was a few months before the game launched I saw an ad somewhere about the game, so I went to the official website and started looking around.
---
Reading about the Elementalist, and seeing that Meteor Shower animation, made my heart beat faster and I knew I had to give it a try.
---
I bought the game a few months after it was released because I didn't have a credit card at the time, and neither did my parents.
---
My first character was an Elementalist, because I loved mages/spellcasters, and playing it, seeing all those smooth animations and gorgeous effects had me hooked.
---
I still remember doing my first dungeon, Ascalonian Catacombs, and I think our party took about an hour or so just to kill the Spider Queen, but once we did we were so proud of ourselves; little did we know that was merely the first boss of many.
---
My dear Elementalist went through several renames and looks, but this is where it all started: https://i.imgur.com/QVtxg.jpg (IDK why he was so mad back then) xD
---
What am I missing with jumping puzzles?   Search this forum for people who hate jumping puzzles and you'll see a lot of zero or negative upvotes.   I can't do them.   Honestly, I can't think of a thing in Guild Wars that enjoy less than jumping puzzles. 
---
Now I have to get through 8 of them for the Skyscale.   I can cope with time gating but JP's stink!
---
Yeah especially when you consider the game is like 7 years old. I just check leaderboards though and 9 players have reached 40k+ AP in NA.
---
After having tried GW1 coming from WoW, the story was easier to follow, i could instance in with my friends and i was not having to pay per month which was good being 14 years old. What got me hooked was the ability to mix and match two classes. My first ever being Ranger/Ele  
---
The exact same thing happened with GW2 coming from FFXIV and it only got better, Im really hoping to get another friend into the game and caught up with PoF as most of my friends have quit since the living world story structure :(
---
Chiming in because the answers below focus too much on gear and gear stats. However, the game's difficulty doesn't scale directly with gear stats, e.g. having exotics—or even ascended—over rares or greens won't make your character that much more effective in combat. Rather, the combat  effectiveness of your character scales far better with your knowledge of their capabilities, such as knowing how to effectively use high-value damage skills, and knowing when to adjust traits and utility skills to suit the specific encounters.

friend got me into it and the combat got me hooked
---
I'm not EU, but since I'm not US too I was out of the promotion.
---
I'm a GW2 fan since launch, and what really got me hooked all these years is how I can jump on and off and not fell lagged behind. The sandbox-ish style of the achievements allow me to set my own objectives and add variety to my plays. I was thinking on inviting some friends to play too, If I got the key I could help them buy their own keys too and we can all jump on the expansion together.

The Norn would be my Second Favorite. the Enthusiasm, Spirituality and Eir herself are really admiring. 
---
I never really had a Chance to read the Books tho... are they recommendable?
---
Thanks.  For the Skyscale achievement, I'll to my best. I can't justify paying almost 48g for eight pungent treats and being completely lazy about it.
---
I guess it's not the "puzzle" part that frustrates me.   It's the exact timing of jumping, jumping duration and direction.   I do well for the first part of the puzzle but, invariably, there's a location where I can't get the timing right.   On top of that, playing in an an area with a restricted view and quick movements is something that makes me motion sick in games.

That's one of the best Ronald McDonald cosplays I've seen yet!
---
The Norn really have grown on me and while i personally don't really play charr, i think that they make a great combination with the norn ("blacked out" norn personal story for reference)
---
Thanks for the offer of help.   I'm NA.  I'll have to do my best and cross my fingers for a few ports.
---
Is that a vivi cosplay? I should do a vivi cosplay
---
I see you are man of culture as well.
---
No she did not it is a limited production from Cook and Becker
---
The Tengu.
---
For real though, they all have their charms.  Norn are goofy and have a great aesthetic.  Asura have that "love-to-hate-em" thing going on and always have something interesting happening.  Humans are, eh...hm.  Sylvari are endearing and engaging and I love the struggle with being dragon minions.  Charr I typically find the most fun.  They're gungho like Norn but cool instead of goofy, and they have such an interesting history and society.  If I had to pick it'd be Charr.
---
But also Tengu.
---
I'd like to take one kind sir.
---
on the TP

?
---
I actually wouldn't complain about that
---
I got hooked back in 2012 with the fluid gameplay :D been playing ever since. I'd love a key to give to one of my friends!
---
I was one of the many coming from gw1 and I ended up spending so many years playing both games.I'm happy to say that I still enjoy them.What got me hooked is quite simple, the first game had no parallel, it was such a peculiar game that shined even just for its format, it was (and is) a brilliant game with almost infinite theorycrafting options.GW2, while trying to go more "mainstream", still kept its predecessor' spirit, it's a fair game, no p2w, lot of focus on characters aesthetics, friendly environment (no "spot taken" and other bs), and even if part of it is less complex than gw1, it improved a lot on the combat feeling.About me, I've always been more like solo player that used to jump here and there helping random strangers than a real guild guy, back on gw1 and on gw2 too, but lately I've been dragged around quite a bit, and many people close to me started to give my dedication for granted.I was considering getting an alt account to go back to my old habits (at least once in a while). I'd like to see again new players really enjoying what they're doing and not arguing over stupid gaming matters like dps and whatnot. I could just talk with my group about its problems, or that I'd like some space to do my own things, but it wouldn't end well, so there is no escape in that sense. I don't want to lose them, because I still care, but at the same I yearn for the old feeling of being that random stranger that showed up out of nowhere just to chill together while doing random things :DThat's my story.
---
No no, what game *aren't* you playing?
---
I'd give them a generic class mechanic trait line that they could slot in. Perhaps these would change the abilities of the base class, so perhaps warrior axe gains life steal or more condition damage or perhaps a Guardian/Mesmer would get some Illusions and Phantasms.
---
Thanks and I totally agree that a better weapon won't matter too much without knowing how to use the character , but I've copied the longbow beastmastery build from metabuild and then messed around with other skills and weapons throughout the story quests to get an idea of whats available. 
---
Not saying I'm super good at the game yet but skill rotations can only be so hard.
---
Yeah i realized a few minutes ago, probably while you were wiring the comment, that if he only wants the chest it won't take add long as the full set. I edited it and hoped no one saw it yet, but i guess i was too slow.
---
&gt; I simply blame bad design, and putting looks and feels before usability
---
This has been the case since the start. Remember that GW1 had a completely customizable UI. GW2 not only *doesn't* have that, but you can't change *anything* about the UI, or hide any of the little swishy-paint details. The game was made by the art department, and not the UI department. Hell, GW1 was completely playable with the 3D renderer turned off. A gray screen with UI, minimap, and skill bar... worked fine; just took a little getting used to.
---
Actually my brother just started to play gw2 and path of fire key would be nice suprise for him &lt;3
---
Hi there! I first want to say thank you regardless of whether or not I win.
---
I got into GW1 really late, a year before GW2 was released. I met my (up until a week ago) fiance playing there, and when GW2 was released, we came over here. Well, while the first 5 months here w/him were good, eventually things fell apart and while the relationship continued, his love for the game did not. So, he gave me his account. 
---
So I built that account up slowly along with my main. Put a lot of effort into it. Then last year he bought a new acct with POF/HOT and I was happy to have my playing partner again. Until he kind of pulled the same crap all over and left me feeling empty with the game (his back and forth crap killed the game for me at the time). He also gave me his 2nd account.. so I kind of worked on building that one up too on days I was bored.
---
Well, our relationship ended really recently. Sad about it sure, but I'm not fussed too much anymore. Especially since I tried to log in and do my dailies yesterday to discover he'd changed the pw's. Yes, it's his right to, my argument isn't with that.. it was more the fact he just wanted to be petty about it and take away some more of my joy.
---
Sooo.. lost my alt account. I'm considering making a f2p and would like to have POF so I could get my mount in WvW (my main game mode). This F2p would likely become my new main just so I could escape the things that bound me, but I don't need POF to do that. It would be nice, but not needed.
---
I'm on NA, so it's likely best you don't pick me anyway. I suppose I just needed a little vent about my situation lol.
---
GL everyone :)
---
Hello, I'll take one.
---
I've been playing for around two years but I can't really afford the expansions, so I'm kinda limited to core content. A friend of mine introduced me to the game and I love it, especially for how "organic" everything feels, from the missions to the discovering of Tyria and the story. It's the only MMORPG that give me a rpg feeling, and that's exactly what I want from a game like this.
---
I was trying hard to use battle standard as a finisher last night and it seems to not work? it never stomped anyone.
---
I delete my comment (including this), you delete yours and no one will know.
---
“Why, yes, I would like to be crushed by a giant woman.”
---
As I mentioned somewhere it'd have to be it's own trait. Like it would have similar themes to the secondary class, but it wouldn't have the exact same traits. This could be problematic as they might need a trait line for each subclass (so like 72 of them).
---
I see a skyscale mini so must be guild wars 2
---
You can hide the journal, events, and everything, in the settings
---
I run a viper's ranger with SB and axe/dagger and it's highly effective.  I wish there was a better offhand for my purposes than dagger but it's good enough.  Tuned specifically for poison and bleeding.  Highly effective.
---
I came to say this. Rev is the most powerful of all the classes to get those orbs since all you gotta do is drop the transform and legend swap to gain your cooldowns back. It will still keep the cooldowns on that legend you were in when you used the skill but that just means be in the less useful/used of your 2 legends so say I'm a glint/jalis hammer rev, just be in jalis when you use the core class skills, drop them and swap back to glint.
---
I'd gladly take one for my fiancé! &lt;3
---
Hey, I would love a key. To answer your question how I got into guild wars 2 was because I used to play WoW with a group of friends for years. As we split up I decided to move on from WoW to start fresh in a new game and make new friends. What got me really hooked was the world bosses. I love grouping up with people and just seeing the mass of players all trying to take down this massive boss. The first time encountering one was an amazing feeling. 
---
Thanks for the giveaway, and good luck to everyone!
---
Initially, I wasn't remotely interested in playing an MMO and only made an account because my younger brother kept begging me to play with him. GW2 later became an emotional refuge during a rough period in my life, and the friends I made in-game ended up pulling me out of a depressive slump + getting me back on my feet IRL. Even if my friends weren't online, just logging in to be with my favorite characters feels like visiting an old friend (I don't RP, but it feels like some of them have gained a life/personality of their own by virtue of the sheer amount of time spent with them).
---
My brother got married recently and his wife has also taken up gaming, courtesy of my brother's --nagging-- enthusiasm. I'd love for her to join us in GW2 too. :)
---
Aw shucks
---
its not very social , people dont talk in groupchats. You realy have to find a social guild in order to get socialism
---
The leggings are probably the easiest, they come from path of fire gathering achievement for each map. It's a roughly 2-5 day gathering achievement depending on how many level 80s you feel like throwing at each node.
---
The boots are requiem so you need the Convergence of Sorrow II achievement, which requires the living world season 4 map. The most difficult part is that you need 440 lumps of mistonium and a little more than 100 gold for the materials
---
Soundtrack brought to you by McDonald's, apparently
---
Unless they changed it recently, the battle standard is a blast finisher, gives some boons, and rallies downed allies.
---
Great meme, we all know there is only the banner slave.
---
No, maybe a flowing pedal aura but not a glow.
---
EU player here I recently find the game and I really like it. Would love a key :D.
---
Thanks anyway
---
You get the stability, fury, and might.
---
It's not that awkward, also it slows down the walking animation which looks best on Charr.
---
[x] Doubt
---
I'll take one, I'm missing PoF. I got into GW2 from way back in GW1. I met a couple of friends for lunch and they were mid conversation about dyes for their clothes. I sat there listening for a while wondering why they were making clothes. Then they explained they were talking about a game they were playing and asked me to join them. They've stopped playing a long time ago but I'm still here. I try to get them back but they got too many kids to spare any time.
---
As other said what this game need is more nice not glowing weapons and armours . Not. A power ranger movie
---
EU here, my brother account lacks PoF, would be good to play together the expansion :)
---
You must break away from the banner slavery. Be strong and assert your DPS dominance. 
---
The banners shall hold us back no longer.
---
Well I think all of the races are interesting aside from the Humans, because human races are typical and boring and are usually just there for familiarity.
---
My Favorite Culture is a toss up between the Sylvari and the Charr.
---
The Sylvari all being connected to the dream and being given purpose at birth is very interesting and especially the Wyld Hunt idea.
---
The Charr are just a very intriguing race, very Roman, which is very fitting for their beasty culture.
---
The Norn are cool because they can harness their Spirit Guardians and turn into bears and such, which NPCs can but we Can't (Anet plz). They're also interesting due to my Scandinavian heritage.
---
Asuras are weird smarty pants, but I like their magic-science hybrid bullshit. Also Golems are cool.
---
But yeah all races but humans are intriguing, Charr and Sylvari are my faves.
---
Also Risen Brute Asuras are hilarious.

Look at https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zojja%27s_weapons the price of a single weapon is about 45g so +/-140g per Weapon set alone.
---
If you look into https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zojja%27s_armor you see the price per piece at about 50-60g depending what type and slot, so about +/- 310g per Armor set.
---
Add to that two sets of Sigills of Impact, Force you're at ~20g
---
Add to that a Set of Sholar Runes you're at another ~50g.
---
Add some proper +9 AR infusions to leech of potion passives you're at another ~130g.
---
And you still need trinkets...
---
Leave scorpion wire be. Without it the w6 event with minipets would be much more annoying
---
Came from wow after getting bored, loving it so far.
---
I just started yesterday, after looking for a good game to play with my partner for a long time. I'm not sure why we hadn't tried Guild Wars 2 yet; It's, by far, the most interesting MMO I've played in years. I'm particularly loving how weapon choice determines available abilities.
---
&gt; your chat did show 23k (which a viewer probably doesn't notice). the bench is 31k (which is a huge difference). 
---
About this, I have been playing this rotation for years now. I have recently looked back into this, have been trying for hours. However, me and others (comments from the SC rotation video), can't seem to hit the 31k benchmark. I have recorded the audio before the gameplay, else you would get a lot of "uhsss" and "whatevers" so that's why it is not 100% accurate. But, look at the bottom left. The numbers are higher there in my ARCDps. Although it does not hit the 31k benchmark (which I did hit in another clip) it shows higher numbers than the one in the top right (21k vs 27k). This has probably something to do with condition damage and ARCDPS. 
---
Thanks for your feedback though!
---
Hello I'd be gratefull
---
It's hella popular but there are other great bulds out there ;)
---
Got into the series when I moved countries at around 12 years old. Didn't know the language and therefore couldn't make friends so gw1 was both my friend and my English teacher . The community and the depth of lore is what got me hooked :)
---
Lol i know the feeling
---
Yes, I am using Viper's in PvE, but I'm still using the old option of Berserker Runes, this is my armor currently:  
---

---
In WvW, I run Marauder trinkets.  
---
/u/bluescreen2315 \- All I'm getting out of the armor is the Rune bonus and Defense.
---
Megaservers would be nice if they were actual megaservers and not just population-limited instances that are considered to be in the same server cluster, because going through a damn map portal can take you to an entirely separate instance of that map in another server cluster entirely, their claim that you will still feel a sense of community and will still recognize the same people you play in maps with is STILL the biggest and most absolutely blatantly false lie they will probably ever be on record having stated.
---
Sylvari for sure, I like their way to approach life. Norn and Charr just behind.
---
Hi, this is in behalf of my daughter who does not have a reddit account. 
---
She loves to play with me, we do missions and roleplay them, specially in the assura zone. 
---
She loves her warrior charr.
---
Yo is that pennywise the clown. I seen that guy around Lions arch 😂
---
Been playing the base game for a little under 2 months, just hit level 80 and even though I don't know much about the game, I've been enjoying the journey every minute. So glad I decided to try out this game.
---
Depends on whether or not you want to spend extra for higher AR infusions. Trinkets are probably cheaper.
---
I got into GW2 after i was bored of T.E.R.A.  What got me hooked was seeing the trailer of a female thief running on the roofs of Divinity 's Reach and using unload, thought that was the coolest shiz ever.
---
Oh, that's true! I'll have to look into what stat combinations are available if 'None' isn't an option.
---
Okay, thanks for the information mate! 
---
One more - is it complicated to install TacO or not really?
---
Yes
---
Hey, i played GW2 on launch for a few months really liked the game, but eventually i got bored and quit, there after my account got locked and i couldnt access it. I came back to GW2 a month ago on a F2P account and really loving the game atm, the community, Pve and WvW is whats getting me hooked.
---
Cheers from Sweden :)
---
It's not because of the i5/i7 difference, at least that's only part of the story. GW2 does use 4 cores at its fullest, which this CPU happens to have, while the i7 of that generation has 4 cores with 2 threads each to give other applications more room. I have a i5-4670k for about a little more than 6 years now, which is similar to your CPU, and I notice that GW2 maxes it out.
---
There's also the ingame webbrowser. For some reason it uses up all resources of 1 core/thread (mostly animations). And when using the gemstore, tp or guild hall panels, you'll notice some very low fps in those panels.
---
When you aren't capping the fps to 60 (or when it doesn't even reach that from the start), your PC is fighting over resources if you aren't only running GW2, but are also watching a video at 1080p.
---
If you happen to have a current gen i5 hexacore instead, I think your use case would be a smoother experience. Of course, Intel reserves hyperthreading mostly for i7+, and that's why i7 is perceived to be better for multitasking, especially if the CPU has a low core count. For gaming only, having hyperthreading enabled is still a debate.
---
And I fully agree with your last statement, people should wait for AMD.
---
they changed it last time they touched banners
---
Just have to be careful in raids, you could end up pulling bosses off the tank.
---
better to just keep a spare set of ascended - which you'll get really fast if you raid or do fractals.
---
GZ dude. I like it 😏
---
Good point, also forgot OP mentioned they do Fractals :)
---
Rolling on my beautiful beetle while being shiny. And doing Not So Secret for fun.
---
I first heard about GW2 through [totalbiscuit's beta videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-UZFu7yZEw) . It feels like so long ago now that GW2 came out and it's impressive how much it has changed since then. The world just seemed so exciting with the dynamic event system and I instantly wanted to play a Charr because they seemed like one of the most unique playable MMO race out there. I actually thought at first that Charr would be OP because they would run faster on all fours - turns out that wasn't the case.
---
Anomalous Vision. Sometimes I see it too. It appaears before his Event starts.
---
Mega servers have nothing to do with WvW at all. They were added long way back, like years and years before links. 
---
In WvW servers matters and the mega server system is not effecting wvw at all. And i agree with you links is what broke it. I just did not understand the point about mega servers. But does not matter :)
---
Your character looks really good, btw! Love the rifle legendaries, they both fill a cool niche and are very different from each other which I do appreciate. Congrats on the legendary
---
A piece of asceded armor is 33g. If you pay 50-60g you simply don't know how to craft ascended effectively. There are tons of ways in this game for free asc weapons and trinkets
---
Couple friends tried convincing me to start around 5 years ago. Wasn't sure though. What really got me to play was that was watching videos and was reading articles on why not to play it but nothing really convinced me so i started playing. I've kept playing ever since. I guess what really got me into it so much is that it's a well round wholesome game. And maybe the salty tears that i have seen from so many players including myself.  Playing on EU.
---
RIP :(
---
You look awesome
---
I wish I had a use for it :/
---
who dat?
---
Ok?
---
I believe they also take inspiration from Mongolian/Asian steppe culture, which is the direction I chose for my Norn. The shamanism, animal and nature spirits match up very well with Tengrism.
---
My brother and his wife got me hooked into Guild Wars right about when Eye of the North came out (although they both played since prophecies, I was still very into FFXI at the time) and they sold me on that game and the idea of GW2. I was all in and we all worked through our Hall of Monuments stuff together and did some of the endgame dungeons to see the game off, and played through all the beta weekends, where my Norn Engineer got me hooked, although they became an Asura in the retail release.
---
They unfortunately fell out of love with both games but I'm still going fairly strong here and want to try to get a few friends into the game if I can convince them to play more in between our FFXIV raid tiers. Last time I got them to try was HoT, and maybe if I surprise one with PoF I can reignite some excitement.
---
Barbie dressup.
---
Yes, could someone fill us in please?
---
i found it interesting. there are a lot of gamers out there (maybe not so much here) that purposely challenge themselves...like beating Dark Souls with a DDR mat...
---
That's too easy
---
Thanks for all the fish!
---
jawgeous
---
My comment to him was the one were i gave him all the info he needed which also included links to wiki and to a video on youtube. The other answer i made was in that thread were they first topic again told him in his first answer that he must buy recepies. After that he included that one recepie from ironlegion, and i added again that he did not have to buy recepies to level his crafting. 
---
I mean you can easy see what is wrong with everything that was said to him. If noone had added why he can not craft anything with what he had on that picture and that he have to buy recepies to make crafting then that is what he would have done. Payed for those recepies he do not have to buy at all because all he really needed to do wat to get the insignias. 
---
If he wanted a particular one set then sure that he need to buy, but his first question and even after that was about how to level up crafting. And yet some how you feel it would have been better that he was left with that answer and bought all those recepies. I don't know what you are trying to explain but i don't agree at all. Which i already said. That is now how we keep players in game.
---
Feel free to message me if you're stuck on any.
---
I started directly at launch and were supposedbto play with two new friends, who told me about it. They left after 2 months and I randomly ran around the world without a hunch. I stayed all because of the amazing artwork and design of the world where you can immerse yourself and forget everyday lift for a moment.
---
It doesn't appear before or after any set time. It just happens randomly throughout every map
---
won't give him the view, but sounds like some good news... for gw2.
---
peon is faking those death threats to get attention   
---
ff14 players are far better than gw2 
---
that idiot just hates every mmo except bdo, so he made a video to criticize ff14 in it he said he didn't lvl up by himself he just bought a story and didn't do and end game content he just asked ppl about it then he goes to shit on the game even tho he didn't even play it.
---
he made the video to get attention to his channel while shadowbringers was coming and all the comments in that video were just ppl pointing out that he skipped every good content in the game and he has no right to criticize it.
---
he removed the video cos of the backlash and many dislikes 
---
[https://livestreamfails.com/post/3795](https://livestreamfails.com/post/3795) here is peon telling some1 to kill himself just cos that person telling him to stop trolling 
---
pls do some research before saying anything
---
I actually really like the human story told and culture revealed via Path of Fire as we explore Elona and surrounding lands. I didn't play GW1 so I'm uncertain if this was existing lore already. My character's backstory is rooted in Elona and the Sunspears rather than Queensdale and feels much the richer for it. 
---
For pure personal story, I agree that the Sylvari seems the most creative and compelling, particularly when they had to struggle against their Creator.
---
I had a match against 3 mirages the other day. The cancer is real, wasn't even a fair fight. Class is broken and chronos are just as bad (though I can actually beat chronos).
---
Read "Clan of the Cave Bear" by Jean Auel if you want more appreciation of Norn culture. One of the art directors even confirms they drew inspiration from that books "But Ayla really wasn't Bear Clan, and her spirit guide was the cave lion. It's been year, people! Seriously no one got this Easter egg. I'm sad."  [Norn Clothing Art Direction](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/bGXav) by Kristen Perry
---
EU Swedish player here. I love the game and would love to try out the holosmith and get the mounts for my engineer but I can't buy the expansion with my current budget. Would love a key if they aren't taken all yet.
---
Looks like VR chat lol
---
Wasn't he also the streamer who said that raids GW2 were a cakewalk (they're not hard hard but still) because he got hard carried while on Hammer Rev by Teapot? I would say it's starting to look like a pattern.
---
Also holy shit that clip.
---
I clicked on it for you, got your back.
---
or at least the random keybinds in combination with the cooldowns do.
---
ur doing it wrong lol
---
Yep, European here :) But I will wait a bit to see if a promo comes up.
---
I've never been able to get close enough to touch it...
---
thanks, mate.
---
I played gw1 like hardcore. Pre-ordered gw2 collectors edition and have been playing ever since!
---
From looking at the video and having been in a similar situation (streamer/youtuber exclusive issues aside) it's more a case of heavy burnout linked to the fact that we are way more likely to remember for loger and take more at heart the negative experiences than the positives. Other non-game related issues may have piled up and not helped the situation issues.
---
Thanks!  I wasn’t aware of the position rewinder at all.
---
Thanks for doing this! So I'm commenting for my brother who I play with. I got both expensions and accidentally made my brother buy the wrong expension for his desired PvP class. So far we've been doing HoT pve content to make up for it! I got hooked again by playing with my bro. We're on EU servers!
---
Even with 400 shards it's 3 weeks+.
---
And if we see it in a realistic way, you don't want to go this way. Minis, fine. Salvaging weapons depends on if you need it for your char/twink or not. Since OP just started with raiding and doesn't have ascended armor, it's most likely that he doesn't have all the ascended weapons for all chars he needs. 
---
And most important, you don't want to exchange gaeting crystals to magnetite shards. Gaeting crystals are 250-400g per 1000. So by exchanging you lose ~40-160g.
---
keep down voting it you ignorant scrubs
---
[Single Thread Performance](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html) is the best benchmark I've found for GW2.  The higher on that list the better.
---
Collections for mounts and armor/weapons skins, coming up with a new armors mix look for my characters, map completion, event chains, achievements...just various goals that I set to work towards to get the item or goal I want or want to do.
---
The Kurzick. :|

Welp  let us  hope it wont last a whole week xD

250 spoons per weapon

Refining it will eat at your gold due to the Thermocatalytic Reagents required, to say nothing of the Obsidian Shards.  Only refine what you need now and will need in the immediate future.  If you have so much that you're actually using up bank space on it, and you don't have the converters the other reply mentioned, then just delete it.  Wasting storage space on something that has negative value is not a wise use of storage space.
---
You'll get more.
---
It's a really fuckin low drop rate. I did not get it either.
---
Hey fella,
---
my English isn't the best. Tbh i really don't know how to start this. I don't know what to write here at all. But first I would like to thank you for your action to do someone unknown a big favor, because those are the ones sitting behind the computer.
---
I personally started GW2 a few months after it was F2P. And I'm still excited about this game. Not because this and that are so great, no. There's really only one reason why this game has drawn me into the band so much. They are people like you. Not only because you give something for free now. Don't misunderstand! People who convey values that unfortunately don't have such a high value in our society today. 
---
I started it back then with my former best friend. Our starting times were probably the best as in all other games! I won't forget the time when it was just fun! I got more and more involved in the game and unfortunately he lost his interest. We lived apart and each of us merged into different games. 
---
How we really went through the cards for hours at that time and rezzed every NPC. How we walked around with the biggest snot gear until x-level. We just not taked it seriously.
---
I can strongly say that I played many online games with my young years. On various consoles/platforms. Have played some also competitively. And yet GW2 won't let me go.
---
If I should get the key, I would give it to my former best friend, so that I can spend more time with him again. We played a lot together and I just don't know how to get in touch with him again. Unfortunately I'm not the type who has the "courage". But enough of it.
---
Nevertheless, I am pleased that there are such actions. I would be really happy!
---
 kind regards           :)     
---
PS: i'm from EU :p
---
Came to GW2 because I saw an Let's Play from Honeyball (german female let's player) and got hooked on the world, the community's (Guilds), WvW and especially that gw2 system. No item windmill, no generic quest system and no P2W.
---
I don't think it will work since when in lich or  shroud you cant use your utility skills
---
Not to mention ANet really hasn't done much to help foster the GW2 Twitch community besides hosting people. 
---
Like take for instance ESO. It does decently on Twitch mostly due to it's [Twitch Drop events they throw](https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/56199). Linking your ESO account with Twitch and atching people streaming ESO content on specifically marked days earns you Oroborus Crates (~~lootboxes~~ surprise mechanics) that you can get rewards (which you can chose to salvage for their gems to save up and buy what you want). While those viewers might not really engage too much or stick around after the event ends, it at least pulls in some people that will who might never have even thought to give a channel a shot in the first place. Plus it helps newer people learn more.
---
It's just seems like it's such a good form of advertising for the game and benefit to the community, that sadly isn't being utilized.
---
Let me know if some other class can exploit it though ;)
---
I'd love it if it was just a hand-held cannon rather than a cannon with a ship exterior on it.
---
Proceeds to crash everyone's computers because the Halloween decor and the population problems ballooning out of control in LA tank fps to slideshow single digits for most modern computers
---
first of all, pvp and pve are completely different..while doing some pve may help with muscle memory and to familiarize yourself with the abilities, the experience doesn't really transfer in any meaningful way
---
secondly, while revenant as herald is like the best pvp spec(or one of the best), renegade and core rev have pretty much always been bad
---
the armor weight=tankiness is mostly a meme: medium armor takes 7% less damage than light and the same for heavy..it's just 14% total which is* something*, but not much!
---
if you wanna play it in pve your best bet is power sword/sword jalis shiro i guess..not great but eh
---
my advice? get HoT if you're serious about rev pvp
---
&gt; Wardrobe Unlock Analyser
---
Another option is https://gw2efficiency.com/account/wardrobe (same functionality but I like it better - for purely aesthetic reasons)
---
Sie sind die BigMacs und wir sind die Jäger!
---
It’s literally a pirate ship.
---
A guildie said he met a guard who used his bubble 4 times in a row so i guess it is possible on other classes too. I have not seen it my self, but i did see several holos from UW on our homeborder abusing it to the very fullest and to a point were it became dumb and impossible to much to them since they can ress and stomp over and over and over and over so i left WvW very early today, was not much fun.
---
option A: lying (most likely)
---
option B: misleading as hell, meaning you did  T1 fractals once or vale guardian or something..there is no way nobody ever noticed you doing like 30% less dps if you raided enough times
---
It is messed up, spending hours - weeks - months on something artistic only to have it downvoted by someone with no explanation is bothersome.  But the main take away is, if you like your art try not think about what other people think of it.  That maybe hard at fist but it will get easier over time.
---
Sylvari are way too black and white with "The Unrecoverable Corruption" of the Nightmare.
---
Nightmare that has been botched twice. Faolain taking control of it and Cadeyrn being just a boss you kill without even bothering with knowing who it is.
---
There should have been two factions among the Nightmare : Cadeyrn one, and Faolain one.
---
And the second time, when the Nightmare plot was dropped from HoT expansion.
---
Human have a rich culture only because GW1 was all about humans and there are a lot of real life culture that were copied to make the various in game ones.
---
But Human are generic so I don't care.
---
Norn aren't really developed in depth. Once you said that they're individualistic spiritual hunters, you know everything you need to know.
---
Asura have the Inquest, an opposite faction that is heavily integrated to Asuran economical/political system, so it can't juste be removed without causing serious harm. And Asuran technology is too important to be lost or alienate them to your country.  
---
Charr face the most foes : Ascalonian Ghosts, Flame Legion, Separatists, and Renegades. With one of them that endlessly respawn. And they have one of the most unusual culture of any video game with their entire society (minus the Olmakhan tribe) handled by military.  
---
My favorite are Asura and Charr.
---
Since Power Reaper is not using Decimate Defenses anymore but Soul Eater you miss 50% crit chances in raid which is a lot.
---
Fortunately for you Soul Eater gives you a busted amount of heal/sustain as it allows you to heal your health bar even while in Shroud.
---
Decimate Defenses is still probably in the vague area of viable but imo the heal/sustain of Soul Eater is worth so much more powerful than the HP you may gain from having some Valky.
---
You can swap berserker pieces for valk until you reach 100% crit in shroud, but generally it's not needed considering that reaper is very tanky by default, especially in raids where you even have healers.
---
Ff14 community is dogshit cancer, especially the raiding community... even wow and league of legends look like a safespace compared to it
---
Since I'm a huge Gilbert and Sullivan fan as well as a fan of nautical fiction this is also by far my favorite weapon.  All the haters can hate,  I'm happy to not be one of the thousands twirling Twilight around.  
---
OK, I'm lying. I totally have twilight.  I wouldn't have bothered to build it if the precursor hadn't dropped for me though.
---
Everyone, COME.
---
Not at all just set the game to Windows full screen
---
yea  except then they made elite specs which  are even more broken so it really doesnt hold weight. I wouldnt doubt they would consider adding multi classing with the same restrictions again+ no elite spec if its not your primary.
---
they should have given refuge blinding powder withdraw immob venom bas venom
---
EU player here! My brother just picked up both expacs and despite being a long-time player I'd love to start from 0 with him again. My main account has guilds and all of that going on and I guess I want to be able to go with him and truly rediscover the game. I have a F2P account set up to help him with certain bits, but it would be nice to have the expac so that I can help him go through the story and fall in love with Tyria like I have.
---
I guess the respite from meta builds and such would also be nice. I just want to hang with some newer players and help them when my brother isn't around, because there were lovely players when I started playing and I'd love to pass that joy on. 
---
As for what got me into the game? Goemm's lab. Impulsively jumped in and spent hours trying to get through it, and just kept going from thereon out. I drifted in and out but overall the game is like a safe place and always helps me out if I'm having a bad time with my mental health. 
---
You're a saint for helping those who weren't in NA when the promo happened. I know I desperately tried to wrangle codes for a few people but just couldn't pull it off, which sucked. They're all sorted now, ironically enough, but so be it! Thank you for giving back to the community, and especially to newer players. You're what makes this game so amazing.
---
be the hero we need and post positive things
---
1.6GHz... this might be a problem. 6GB is enough, though, I do not recommend trying to use browser and game client in same time.
---
anet doesnt like veteran players   
---
their target consumer is the casual player that logs in every 4 months for 4 hrs a week
---
You don't get my point
---
Yeah that's what I was concerned about.
---
i don't need to   
---
be the optimistic one
---

---
It's downloading while i do a 4 hour shift at work. Guess we'll see later.
---
good for you   
---
keep playing dead wars 2
---
Usually I do NSS in ab. 1h - I am bad at jumping (just learned how to use mouse properly, played with forcetouch before), but I am dedicated/stubborn. And I use spectral walk. A lot. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Tbh. I love all JP, but NSS is famous for being a reason for rage quitting and it's still the JP that is most punishing imho. But it is so satisfying to finish with the diving part.
---
They put a boat on a rifle. They don't need to say it's a joke to know a boat rifle is not a serious thing.
---
Thanks for the giveaway! Im a NA player, played Guild Wars 1 until Eye Of The North and then back into the fray on GW2.
---
WvW is my thing, sadly it doesnt get much love from the devs (alliances when, BTW).
---
To make that claim, your source? (I've played all 4 games: wow, lol, ffxiv, gw2)
---
One of my best friends introduced me to GW2 in September of 2012. My favourite early memory was him showing me all the jumping puzzles and explaining the lore connections from GW1. I still get all warm and fuzzy when I start up the game and hear the LA or DR themes.
---
Might as well get rewards while you do it
---
As long as you keep model limit and shaders low you should be fine.
---
lmfao
---
Ah,Ministers waypoint the meeting place of learned individuals of culture.The only place in central Tyria where you can witness miniature clauns,Choya stampede and verbal tickle duels.
---
To be fair if you played Human there was the possibility of a circus from the beginning.
---
I'm with you the Sylvari were my favorite, but I did have fun playing them all.
---
Human interactions with Lord Faren were super fun.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Darksteel_Rifle  I get that it's meant to be the entire ship, but some ships were known for their cannon.  Let that basic skin smoke like crazy and do the rest then we're in business.
---
I got into the game after reading good reviews about the story, gameplay, the diversity of builds you could run in pve/pvp, and the horizontal progression. 
---
Once I tried the game I fell in love with the sync-level system since it made it possible to keep playing in areas I liked without feeling like I was gimping my leveling progress plus I could also get loot that was useful for my level from events and monster drops. 
---
I also loved the meta events and how they made the maps feel more active and alive with different tps being blocked by events, some npc posts getting overrun by monsters and becoming unusable, special zones being unlocked according to the progress of the events, etc.
---
I love the personal story too because of the options it gives you when going through the story, meeting different npcs, accessing different quests, etc. Plus having pcs with voice really helped with the immersion and the feeling of actually being a part of the story and helping shape the world instead of just being a glorified bystander/witness.
---
the low viewership of gw2 on twitch has nothing to do with anet not "fostering the community" or "toxic viewers" the game is just boring to watch. plain and simple. wow is not as boring but you still need another draw, the reason asmongold is successful is because he plays a character and he brings something to the table other than boring mmo gameplay, same goes for other successful MMO streamers, you gotta be really good (reckful) or be entertaining.
---
That’s why you take your axe and just run right to the starter zone boss. If you’re lucky you get there right as it dies, if not you just hit it a couple times. Honestly the free level and waypoint is worth it IMO since you save time by using the WP right after the first mission.
---
EU here:

I got into GW2 by watching Simon and Lewis (Yogscast) play it before the beta went live they seemd to have a lot of fun playing it and it convinced me to try it. I bought the game the day it was released and I was instantly captivated by the world and the combat system. I am a sucker for trying different playstyles and classes so how Guildwars 2 did it was a fun experience since I didn't have to commit to 1 character and play it as other MMO's often dicate . As time went on I realised that many things like casting while walking, the 3D movement and now glding/mounts really make the game a fun experience. Sometimes I play other games but in the end I keep getting reminded by how well Gw2 does things when I look at other games.
---
The skins being jokes doesn't undermine the work behind.
---
But a big majority of players don't like silly item skins.
---
Has anyone posted Qadim the Peerless speedkills?
---
Love the steampunk look you got there!
---
100 - 33 (trait) - 20 (fury) - 4 (spotter) - 4 (banner) - 7 (sigil) = 32% crit chance needed
---
This is because TacO needs to exit properly for it to save settings. Either turn on the exit with GW2 option or exit TacO in-game (not force close in task manager) to save settings. It’s annoying but that’s how it is.
---
need for a friend who just started gw2.
---
I got into gw2 from gw1 :)
---
This confuses me so I am very interested. What have you found to fill your time? for this many years while playing content I would personally found quite superficial and 'one and done'
---
All I can think about is Open World and Living Story though, when I mention this.
---
jorbreaker 297...  0.0594% chance of drop.... fantastic
---
Thank you very much for the suggestion. Other than the sigil change, is it still Scholar runes + Lightning-proc sigil as the best options for Reaper?
---
You pick goals. I like making legendary weapons. I also like some of the more difficult achievements. I run a guild which takes some time and I enjoy helping people get their goals after I've finished what  I do.  
---
I'm a mad altoholic. I have over 40 characters, each one themed, outfitted with different looks, often with different builds. My power chrono and my condi mirage play very differently even though both are mesmers, and learning them both takes time.   
---
I have the PvP legendary back piece. I have the Fractal legendary backpiece, and while I do raid, I'm close to rank 1000 in WvW and I'm close to somewhere in the 90s in PvP.    
---
I go into a zone and I want the rewards from that zone. Most recently, yesterday I finished making vision. But I'm not a farmer. I just play the zones as a feel like and get what I need from playing.   
---
You play single player games through ones for a story. You play MMOs over and over again for various rewards. You set your goals and go for those.
---
  
---
What keeps me in the game, though? My guild. The people I play with. That's really want an MMO is about.
---
I do spend a disproportionate amount of my time helping new and returning players get into the game.
---
Scourge isn't even a "condi" build anymore in pvp. They focus more now on corrupting boons off targets for their primary condi application.
---
Hi! It all started with me watchimg some youtubers play gw1 i watched them doing some events and dungeons and i instantly got hooked into the game, i loved the combat system and always wanted to play it but couldn't. Then some time has passed and i saw gw2 release i was like i have to play this game so i bought it and crushed the play time literally everyday. That's my story. Thank u for reading! Good Luck Everyone!
---
Looks like new mistshard heavy armor with the Norn t3 heavy chest and the Skyscale horns
---
Just because you don’t play pvp doesn’t mean that people don’t enjoy it.
---
Let's not go there.
---
Just got started with a F2P account and I really love the game but I feel so limited :x
---
I really love how theres so many things to do, so many events and the things to see are endless! Cant stop exploring and see what else is out there (:
---
The smaller circle stomps, the larger circle resses
---
What else can you expect from people who upvote low effort cosplays and mystic forge/map completion pics taken with phone camera?
---
That’s a great reason to do this, it’s better than what many people did which was get the codes for their alts. I forgot to put how I got into Guild Wars so I’ll put it here, I was introduced to this game by my cousin who was the person who got me into MMOs and video games in general, so we played through the core game together but when he left for college he stopped playing and I’ve kept playing but not as frequently as before
---
I just started playing. I’m a new teacher on my first summer vacation, figured it’s a good time to start a new MMO. I don’t know how it took me so long to try GW2. I’d appreciate the code, although I don’t really know what it unlocks (very new).
---
EU here. I remember seeing videos of the closed betas and was instantly
---
Except it's not always a 1 to 1 ratio. You can make amazingly good content, but that doesn't mean that you're going to get exposure from it (especially if it's in a niche area like an MMO). Thats's one of the reasons these things help, they give content creators more exposure. While not everyone is going to necessarily stick, there are people that do.
---
Also you say it's a waste of dev time but it's great marketing for the game, helps newer players figure out what to do (especially when it comes to end game or just explaining things about classes or mechanics), gives the community some degree of joy from earning a reward, and doesn't take much effort to run (assuming you have it set up right). It's nowhere close to esports and dealing with things like class balance, prize money, making sure regulations are set up appropriately based on local federal requirements, and the laundry list of other things to sort through with that.
---
literally who
---
Oh yeah, this cool thing!
---
I guess I have a goal for the next few weeks!
