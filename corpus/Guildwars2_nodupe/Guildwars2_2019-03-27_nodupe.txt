Possibly. They might have changed a lot of that over to use unidentified gear though...
---
We still get bags of gear from raids dont we?
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
if we do then i think its worth keeping the lvl 50 alt
---
That pump it and dump it attitude is why the game is in the state it's in.
---
Oh sorry didn’t notice
---
Ty didn’t realise
---
So, figured I'd write it here.
---
Whenever I make a new loginfile it disregards the graphical settings entirely. No matter whether I set it, repair it, manually set the graphics in the launchbuddy launcher, import the graphic config, or change the graphics ingame before closing the client - it still resets all graphical and audio settings to some default (fullscreen,dpi scaling, etc) whenever I open that client.
---
All my old files work fine, but wasn't paying attention with the update today and had to re-set one, and now I just can't seem to change its settings no matter what I do.
---
Thanks for the continued effort you've put into this!
---
I may be old and it gives me perspective. Try to follow the conversion young man.
---
1. OP says we have no information now and I'm worried.
---
2. I point out that 4 years ago the situation was the same.
---
3. You point out something completely different about 2 years ago with a game with a completely different lead time.
---
4. I assume that you can follow a conversation and commented on what I was talking about.
---
If the situation was the same 4 years ago as it is today there's nothing to be worried about. Keep in mind that we learned about HoT 9 months before the expansion released, we learned about PoF directly much closer to when it was released, so preinformation was in about the same time range.
---
For example in the example you actually furnished, it was during episode five of the living world which was less than six months before the launch of PoF and proves nothing.
---
Being older doesn't make you wrong. :)
---
This game doesn't guide you by hand or noticeable breadcrumbs - you gotta explore and learn stuff by yourself
---
I've actually just finished the dragonsblood weapons and it felt like a real chore. I don't even like the skins that much, I've done it mainly for completionism. And now here I stand facing another 1600 Branded Mass just to unlock the 'Chasing Tales' achievements. Nope.
---
I could understand his original fine
---
Maybe contact gw2 support? Honestly no clue that’s probably the best bet, until they get back to you, i would ignore the email
---
I think that requires using the gliding dodge skill rather than getting stealth.
---
But the only way to be sure is testing, of course.
---
I personally really enjoyed the recent gem aura outfit.
---
TL;DR?
---
I mean the one to get Junundu Whisperer.
---
I try to get it again when it's desolation dailies, but there's always one troll that starts it early before we gather enough people.
---
Alright thanks! Ill stick to herald for might check for druid to get a sweet comp!
---
All in all, there is no reason to salvage unidentified gear. Why is Anet even allowing us to salvage unid gear? I hate to think they just didn't have the time/QA to just scrap the ability to salvage unids, making unids essentially function as bags.

What if this map is more like of a dragon stand like map from HoT, where we will battle kralk :D

Aww... I loved slippery. D:

As herald, press F2 to make your chrono friend into a god of boonspam.
---
"Cat"apult. Seriously though, that could be an interesting concept for a second wvw mount. GW1 had Siege Turtles which did pretty much the same thing shown in the picture.
---
Anet should rework the places, NOT the mount or the mount will be useless and people will stop doing WvW again.
---
arc dps uninstalls itself because your dps is too low
---
&gt; I got 39 rares and 4 exotics from this batch of 1k unid gear.
---
Ouch.
---
 I'm working on a post about pre-patch results with silverwastes MF. And I think I got about 33 exotics from ~2900 fine+masterwork unidentified gear. ~28 exotics per 250 rare unidentified gear after that.
---
Try deleting the "bin64" folder with all the chromium files under the GW2 folder, so they get downloaded again.

---
he cant see my dps, my game doesnt even open kkkkk
---
Is that bad? Good? I dont get it.
---
GW1 had some brilliant lore.
---
Well I'm also counting my server's team chat (both for my main account and my alt account). Not actually sure which is worse between reddit and TC's team chat.
---
I asked myself the same question when doing this research because it seemed stupid to have the ability to salvage unid gear directly.
---
I found two reasons:
---
Initially, during PoF beta weekend, nid gear salvaged into all tiers of common mats, not only t5 and t6, so the loot table of salvaged mats looked quite different compared to salvaging the identified gear.
---
I am not sure why they changed it when PoF went live because i quite liked the idea of having the choice between getting all tiers of gear or only t5 and 6.
---
But since the loot table for salvaging directly and identifying before salvaging is pretty much the same now with the added drops of rares and exos to the latter, there really isnt any scenario in which salvaging directly will ever yield more profit than IDing. 
---
The only trade-off for identifying is added opportunity costs, which might seem insignificant for most veterans that have plenty of bag and bank space and salvage o matics but I can see it being quite a hassle for a new player to identify 1 stack of unid gear before salvaging it when he only has 90 bag slots, more than half of them occupied with other stuff and no extra bank tabs unlocked...
---
I googled it and looked at the first three sites. It's full of suspicious "lifechanging" books, you friend Ryan Holiday ofc and similar blogposts who wants to sell their books. So all I see are unserious books and people/blogs who advertise for their unserious books. That's it. 
---
You can show me as much "motivation books for a better life" as you want, it won't change anything. 
---
I'm not talking about "how you should act" or "how you should listen to yourself" or whatever your blog guys say to sell their books. I'm talking about the reality, about empirical research. Things you can see and hear, things that you experience. 
---
Take a few random people and watch them for a few months (ofcourse that would take time and effort, but you could also think of people you live with, your family or somebody who you know much aspects from.). Watch how they act in different situations. The one is very honest at his job, because it's necessary for this job or he loves his job or for whatever reason. But the same person likes to cheat at poker or other games, because he hates to lose or whatever reason. Another guy will correct the seller, if he gets too much change, but on another day or at an other seller he just take the money. And many similar things. 
---
That's what you notice, if you watch people. You can even notice it for yourself, if you watch honestly. 
---
People aren't monotonous in their acting, they don't "do everything like thy do anything" at all. That's no human behavior.
---
If it gave more basic and fine materials and no essences of luck, it may have been worth considering, but not as it is. 
---
I was referring to the [Gift of Hidden Descent](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_Hidden_Descent) that needs you to experience stealth gliding as a class, my theory is that the game checks if you get stealth when you're gliding because pressing dodge doesn't move you anywhere.
---
But now that you mention it, it may just check if you get stealth on dodge which raises another question because mirage can dodge in mid air, can someone dodge with mirage and time it correctly with mass invis to get the achievement, or be stealthed and then dodge to get it?
---
Tangled Depth is a painful zone; there is _no other zone_ like it. once you're past it you'll be fine.
---
Slippery Slope should never have been an issue. There were way more counters to slippery slope (movement weapon and util skills, traits that lowered those skill CDs and dodging) than birds (only dodging).
---
But slippery slope had been  deliberately falsely portrayed by some in the community as uncounterable. So when average players get into fractals they dont know how to counter it and gets no help from gw2 forums or reddit. Over time this drove negative sentiment towards this particular instability. 
---
Slippery slope being uncounterable is the biggest lie that i've seen told by  some in the gw2 community since the game's release.
---
Super Adventure Box is the one thing that keeps me coming back to GW2
---
Is there going to be a world 3 this year, or any new content at all?
---
1 player = no problem, sure
---
the issue is 50 players doing this, which *do* instantly kill you 
---
no /s 
---
I usually don't mind it, but the angle on it just feels horribly wrong to me.
---
The fact that it's unbuttoned solely to show off cleavage probably doesn't help, since the weapons, backpiece, and outfit has an "adventuring/wilderness priest" look to it overall so the whole "seducing with the cleavage" seems horribly out of place to me. If the entire coat was unbuttoned, I think I'd find it much more enjoyable.

Don't be discouraged! TD isn't that difficult to navigate once you've done it for a while. Assuming you're on a NA server, PM me your in-game name and I'll gladly tag along to help you out when I have free time. I really enjoy the TD gerant meta event.
---
&gt; my game doesnt even open
---
see? 0 dps
---
Does feel to have aesthetic similarities to Zafirah's and White Mantle outfits's silhouettes. But all three are meant to be "Tyrian religious/priestly" so it kind of fits. But at the same time, doesn't feel as unique as the weapons/back does.
---
Learn there is one map to hate and be fine with that.  It took me about a year and a half to get over my deep hatred of TD.
---
The bags of gear still give low level gear on a low level toon, so that part is still intact. 
---
Lets hope so. I hate that it meta to move over champ bags to level 50. So annoying
---
K tested it with more bags, still works good lol
---
This map is the only challanging part of the entire open world game. Rest of the continent is just flat and boring. [TD Navigation Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8gEomPMj40)
---
Movement skills didn't counter SS, SS made movement skills worse to the point of being almost unusable.
---
I am SO glad I can say that in the past tense.
---
Yeah that's my biggest issue when I first had this thought because everyone I know has gotten the achievement. 
---
It depends on which leap skill and instant teleports completely counters  the sliding. Dodging also completely stops the sliding no matter when or which way you dodge; therefore serving as a counter. There were many things that countered Slippery Slope. Once you realise it it becomes a non issue over time with practice. Slippery slope is less of a problem than we breath fire in 100CM especially during the 2nd boss. The only difference is people realise to use reflect and projectile blocks to counter we breath fire but they dont realise how to counter slippery slope.
---
I mean when the people with the fastest kills on CM bosses think that the instability is trash, its probably not a player skill issue.
---
Finding hidden caves, doing achievements, and pvping whenever you feel like it counts as "sandbox" in this community.
---
Upvoted because I'm pretty sure you highfived yourself after that one and I approve.
---
true. a good option for people who maxed Luck
---
\*sniff sniff\* hmm.. I think I smell the ink of a new map to explore being made =)
---
(He said hopefully)
---
Eh.. Human female meta, how original... 
---
Yes I agree. Only available to those that completed the the achievement. Lots to think on and how they would do it I guess
---
Puts gw2 'lore' to shame
---
All offf themmmm
---
I dont know what build you have play but I didnt get to the same conclusion. People are use to play Druid so that most be why you feel it better but in reallity Druid didnt have an amazing healing output. Firebrand Healer and Renegade Healer could get higher Hps than Druid.
---
Healer Renegade is super hard to play but its not the worst. Its even the best IMO in some fight where you need to spike heal or mitigate damage (Gorseval Retal negate with Kalla). The only thing I hate is the Alacrity being given around you with F4 skills. Healer Renegade would have been an amazing tank but it couldn't on bosses with tank because of that.
---
Healer Firebrand is not a great spike Healer outside of Tome F2 but it could give an amazing constant Heal each seconds (F2 Passive, Symbole, AA mace, Aegis Heal) and Aegis could help even more.
---
Sadly those two healers couldn't give might that Druid could give. So my statics and I start trying Dps Firebrand and Dps Renegade. We didnt follow any guide and came up with build different than Snow Crow:
---
Renegade use the Condi build but with the Alacrity traits and spam F3 in his rotation. It didnt give 100% uptime but it still good enough.
---
Firebrand is a my baby. I come up with a Hybrid build with Plaguedoctor/Seraph stats. Traits possibility is really high and flexible with Firebrand. You could easily be more support or more Dps. This build in hand that know the fight and what he could do, can carry a group (bad healer, use more support traits or bad Dps, use more Dps traits). In most raid fight, I could easily out Dps pugs, still give perma Quickness + Fury + 15 Mights + around 1k Hps.
---
In conclusion, both Healer, Dps or hybrid with Renegade and Firebrand could be viable. The problem IMO is the player knowing How to play them, How to play with them AND How to build squad with them. With my static, we recreate role so its easier to know what we need and what we have: [ Tank, Healer1, Healer2, Alacrity1, Alacrity2, Quickness1, Quickness2, Might1, Might2, Fury1, Fury2]. This way everyone need to be a bit more flexible with build but I find it really interesting and it create fun possible build to be play (Boon Generator Herald Dps, Thief Might Generator, etc...).
---
People might think this idea isnt good and make less smooth run but I found it way more smooth. Because in comp where you have people doing to much role at the same time losing one member (Druid or Chrono) really affect your team.
---
A weapon to surpass metal gear
---
Are you sure about that second statement?  
---
The bags have always had a chance of giving higher tier goods, it's just that up until now MF would affect that result. My interpretation of the patch notes is that the chance is still there, but MF doesn't affect it anymore.
---
I think that some aren't aware of your implied “/s” tag.
---
Oh, yeah, /s XD
---
You're correct. The new static chance for an Unid to upgrade tier when identifying is significantly lower compared to identifying them with high MF previously. rude_asura's new post gives a pretty good picture.
---
Keep in mind that unidentified gear is a new, additional source to get exos for Central Tyria and HoT maps. You still have the same chance to get exos as direct drops as before. 
---
So for Central Tyria and HoT maps these 4 exos per 1k green unid gear are 4 additional exos. 
---
Also 4 out of 1000 -&gt; 1 per stack isn't that bad. Pre patch it was the rate for blue gear at ~700% mf. Ofcourse the rate is lower, because of no mf influence anymore, but it's still a reasonable chance, especially since it's additional to the drop we already had. 
---
(I think I should have mentioned more often, that these drops are additional to what we got pre patch. :P)
---
There will be some new content, see the link below. Doesn’t seem like W3 yet...

---
I like glow in moderated amounts. I think it can have its place but when u start making everything glow heavily its pretty ugly at times.
---
I do like a little bit of soft textured glow on a weapon maybe or even an aura.
---
However when you have insane amount of buzzing bees, looking like a really toxic sun-worshiping hylek krait hybrid hand heavily textured low res skin, it's quite ugly IMO.
---
These outfit designs  
---
I think it makes people look like a mish mash of paint that a 2 year old mushes together with their baby food. 
---
Stack auras generally makes people look really bad IMO. I think some over the top implementations of it CAN work but in the general case ehh.
---
In terms of Anets design, I personally feel like there is a lack of shape balance in most of their armor sets then shoving glow ontop only gurther accentuates that, and I don't like it. 
---
Don't you just love how every trash tier wannabe player is defending slippery slope by claiming this instability was too hard, while in reality the difficulty level of that shitty instability was the only thing not wrong with it? Fucking hell, man. This annoys me so much.
---
No. I refuse to pay respects for that abomination.
---
I find the gw2 wiki and gw2efficiency’s crafting tool very useful for these things. 
---
The second site maps out what items you need and costs, particular to your account once you input your API. A very handy resource. 
---
goddamit dat shaman!
---
Some find it easier to navigate if you don’t look at the mini-map at all while exploring it- you’ll just get even more confused. 
---
Try to take it slow and learn the map on your own, without the map. You will learn how to get places eventually. 
---
No I mean the bags of gear. [This stuff.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bag_of_Masterwork_Gear)
---
Too much shit going on for me. It looks like the imagination of a ten year old came to life. Interesting glitch though 
---
With the changes to loot drop into unidentified gears, is it more profitable for me to sell the Unidentified gears, or salvaging them and selling the Mat?
---
How do you get that much MF, I've gotten up past 700 before but 944?
---
You are just getting bad Firebrand and Renegade players. Their isnt guide about those build so player seems to not know how to play them... I play with my Static this comp: Firebrand Condi Dps Buffer (me), Renegade Healer and 3 Dps. 
---
I can assure you, a Firebrand can easily pull ads like focus with Axe 3 or Tome1-S3, use Xera Portal like Mesmer (on fractal) and give more Aegis than mesmer (7 or 9 sec CD). He can even give Stability, remove massive Condition, give 1k Hps, deal massive spike damage single or cleave, nice Dps, and even more with Tomes skills (Fractal CD Reset Shenanigans).
---
Btw I get bad Druid and Chrono too in Fractal/Raid. Chrono that give no Boons, didnt have Dps and didnt support the group was pretty common. Druid that didnt heal at the right moment, stack bad might, never blow in his Warhorn, didnt CC and camp Staff was common too. 
---
IMO its more about, we didnt have Guide about how to play support in GW2 and people clearly didnt understand how to play support.
---
Haha lmao
---
Current maximum is 955%. Just curious as to what 11% magic find you are missing. Most likely Achievement point MF right?
---
When is the official end of this codes eligibility? I just want like a date, or a “You have x amount of hours” and I can’t find that anywhere.
---
My boyfriend was so close to buying this morning but got drunk after work and passed out before he had the chance, realllllllllllllllllly hoping we still have tomorrow.
---
I would pay SOLID money for a pack of mount skins that change it from mounts to different jetpacks.
---
You didnt mention the build use by Chrono... I suppose in comp 2 Chrono + Druid + Healer you didnt mean 2 Chrono with 2k Dps like we always get in pugs and are you tanking with Druid or Chrono on bosses with aggro on toughness.
---
So Balthazar is pulling a Drax? I like it.
---
Honestly speaking it's how every MMO works out there. No MMO will go back to update old stuff, unless it's required for certain new features, systems and so on.
---
If they kept reworking old stuff, instead of "you" here, there would be someone else asking for new content instead of reworking stuff *cough* season1 *cough*.
---
The game is in this state because of other reasons. Like not having to work on something that steadily improves during the LS (like the sun's refuge was a pretty cool idea...too bad that it was abandoned after that episode).
---
And a general lack of depth of the releases because they do not want to put any meaningful progression...nor have the time to put proper dedicated rearward to each added content.
---
There’s no info on mastery and map completion though, which is what I was asking. Gw2efficiency is good for cost in gold and other currencies primarily.
---
Do I need full HoT masteries?
---
Yes, let's count the number of skills which are (a) teleport skills, which are (b) reliable enough to use on the many, many occasions where positioning is compromised by SS, and which can (c) justifiably be substituted for any utility skill without janking the build.
---
Using movement skills and dodging to overcorrect is NOT a counter. What are you even thinking? I'd rather just tap WASD super quickly if I had to minutely reposition myself.
---
Thankfully we don't have to do any of those things anymore.
---
Lmao. Cos Anet sure cracks down on exploiters amirite. Only when the masses exploit it then "oshit its a problem". 
---
this one? https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Permanent_Portable_Provisioner  
---
you can exchange for sieges and food
---
Firebrand has amazing sustained healing when running Staff, so if you want to you can just have the renegade go full diviner/zerk setup and put the firebrand on healing if neccessary. I sometimes forget to even use the book because staff heals are so good. Did overheal VG a few days back, my subgroup never even dipped low because of timing staff 4 to have its last tick happen after green explosion. Can heal at 1200 range at anytime super well through staff 2, and it super easily tops off grouped allies. Together with regen firebrand heals are superb.
---
I run Honor 113, Radiance 212, FB 223(333 if im not on quickness duty), full magi, some random boon duration rune bc I'm lazy but optimal would probably be monk or dwayna. Axe/Shield Staff, healmantra-quickmantra-bane-cleansemantra(for regen)-fmw if quickness-ing, healmantra-bane-situational-situational-elitesignet if not.
---
Good bot.
---
It isn't illegal if it's outside the Imperium. :)
---
"Challenging content" lmao.
---
The people who are affected the most are people who do CMs and T4s, areas of the game with the smallest populations.
---
God forbid we have actual handcrafted challenges instead of randomly generated mechanics that don't even change how you deal with the fractal.
---
You know how games like Monster Hunter or Dark Souls get praised for good gameplay? Because it's every encounter has mechanics that are all designed with thought and intention, not a lazy and sloppy global paintbrush of mechanics that just force you to burn dodges or have no counter play.
---
Nightmare and Shattered Observatory are fun game content even without stupid nonsensical instabilities, because the challenge and fun is in the well telegraphed mechanics. Environments that are entirely up to the player skill, environments that are stable and conducive so feel good getting better than content, not having different crap every day.
---
If instabilities are so good you should make a thread asking for raid instabilities and see how that goes. Might as well put it in PvP as well, it's challenging gameplay.
---
0 ectos when not ID'ing... dang. So blindly salvaging still not a good option it seems...
---
that's sick. i love it
---
Gosh.
---
You have to set it manually in the options panel, but it's there.
---
Honestly the whole set of Defiant Glass stuff looks like it should drop in wing 3.
---
And despite that... it looks incredible.
---
Shiny was last seen in the Hidden City. 
---
I've had this happen a few times before, my favorite was with the Dervish outfit with legendary heavy armor
---
&gt;However, if you have more unidentified gear than you have inventory space, you can't easily just identify them all, you'll need at least a few more clicks.
---
With very few drops being anything but Unidentified Gear, this should rarely be an issue for you. If it is, just deposit all, or craft larger bags.
---
Play until you get to Auric Basin (reached after the first act of the story) and do the Trial by Fire and Attack on Tarir meta events every few hours for an absurd amount of XP. Verdant Brink also has a spider farm and things with a lot of enemies. Otherwise, just sit back and take it slow. It's an account-wide unlock, after all. You might not even have enough Mastery Points to use with the experience anyway.
---
&gt; any way to make it less of a grind?
---
Stack as many of these as possible:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experience#Experience_modifiers
---
quick question....what does all this have to do with the birds instab? did you hit reply on the wrong comment? i have not once talked about/mentioned slippery slope
---
If OP has an exp booster, I'm a big fan of popping one right at the start of the Dragon Stand meta. It's a pretty steady stream of events to do *and* tons of mobs to kill to make good use of the 10 stack exp bonus.
---
The major map metas also relatively conveniently line up so that you can do the first night boss of VB (usually Matriarch) -&gt; TD -&gt; AB for tons of exp AND loot back to back.
---
Nope. Opening unid gear on a level 50 character gives you level 80 gear.
---
You have to replay entire mission every time you fail to dodge. Thats what makes it bad.
---
It says that most level 80 areas drop unidentified gear now. Does it drop in the silverwastes, and if so is that gonna affect gold farming?
---
I really thing you're just setting yourself up for a world of frustration if you try this.  GW2 isn't really set up to let you be this partcular in how your character fights, if it is that important to you I'd try a different game.
---
Then they changed something, there is a fire thingy to interact to skip the mission
---
Explains why i felt it was easy
---
What John_Hunyadi said is true, but I still make these sort of "functional roleplay" builds for fun, as I already have over 14 characters in meta builds. My other characters are just  for fashion and weird builds that I use for open world.
---
I have a Air/Water themed weaver as well, I went with air sigils and rune of air for even more lightning. (It used to proc lightning strikes but now it gives shocking aura).
---
It's not a build to ever use in any content besides solo open world (not meta events), and I don't recommend building these sort of fun builds unless you have disposable gold and a good PvE build already set up that you can swap to.
---
Just checked it on my bag opener and its just like before in that you get the gear appropriate to that char's level and no unid'd gear.
---
I make fun builds for solo open world a lot but what you are asking for is not possible.
---
Air and lightning are tied just as ice and water.
---
It's hard on your face, so there's that.
---
Bind a stow weapon key, so you can stow your staff during a channel and get a shorter CD.
---
I got the codes from the webpage right after buying it, where it also said im gonna get them in e-mail aswell. Then i didnt bother checking my mail for a day...
---
stfu tool
---
It's good. I was scared the change in loot drops would have affected it.
---
I think it shouldn't be a problem with invisible bags. Or shared inventory. (Maybe I am out of the loop but I've always had an invisible bag for things I didn't want to salvage or sell. I thought that is what they were made for.)
---
Any guesses on if they will release the Infinite Continue Coin again?
---
For sure ff14 is really slow. Just getting out of a Realm Reborn is easily a 50-100hour grind.... I agree completely though. The genre in general is pretty stale these recent years and gw2 comes as the best option for someone not wanting to grind gear on a treadmill.
---
GW2 efficiency has that option in the [achievement search](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/achievements?filter.display=available-points&amp;filter.masteriesOnly=Maguuma).
---
1st time adventure completion is a massive EXP reward tbh. 
---
I am familiar with that narrative. It doesnt work.
---
I wasn't really paying much attention to that but I didn't have any noticeable tanking. This was during several keep fights with maybe 80 people around total. 
---
People like OP are impossible to hide things from once they hit the game files.
---
Burn me, its a stingray.
---
Already known... 
---
Never just salvage it, sell or ID + salvage. At ~2s a piece for green unided you'd get 20g selling 1000 - TP fee = 17g. Looks like it is still [better to ID + salvage right now](https://imgur.com/gallery/iazadQK).

Install GW2TacO and use its paths for the mastery insights and Adventures, that'll give you plenty of Mastery Points to spend. For the Heart of Thorns Mastery Experience, the absolute fastest way to get it is to get into raiding, raids give a *ton* of mastery EXP and Wing 1-4 all give Heart of Thorns EXP (Wings 5 and 6 are Path of Fire)
---
&gt; Also impossible to make any rng-loot-reliant system feel rewarding for everyone (incl. low-mf people) with chances at nice stuff while not having top-mf players get more than intended and making the nice stuff worthless.
---
This doesn't make much sense. It would be the easiest thing in the world to solve by making MF additive rather than multiplicative. A single line of code would probably need to change.
---
For example, a person with 400% MF now might get 4 times as much chance at a magic item compared to a person who has 100% MF. They could change the formula to 140 or 104 for the 400% MF person 110 or 101 for the 100% MF person.
---
OOTL as I haven't been playing Fractals for a while. What was so bad about them that they had to be removed?
---
They've also had more time
---
sweet, I missed out on the Foefire Mantle. reeeeeee
---
My opinion of birds was that the actual bird creatures were more annoying than the blind effect.
---
I'd say chances are high. It's pretty much a necessity for Trib mode until you develop your skills.
---
Wait, isnt now SilverWastes farming hit? Bags from SW will now be unidentified gear and these are all lvl 80 right? SW farm was about getting bags and opening them on 52 ish level character to get lower tier materials. Is that not possible now ?
---
Yea that was how I read it the first time. I thought the birds would become friendly and attack the other npcs
---
As if lower tier mats weren't hard enough to get on a lvl 80
---
No, unid gear always IDs as max level
---
I think you should just build a new PC asap tbh , those specs are too weak for the 4k Monitor
---
I'm thinking the same thing. There is a whole slew of options he can choose from and you're hes gonna quit. Ask in map chat for help navigating, avoiding the zone til you cool off, looking up guides/videos online to understand how to get around. The difficulty to survive is something you have to overcome on your own. Be it by refining your build, changing your class or getting tricks from someone else. You have options yet you're just going straight to quitting which makes me think you don't enjoy the game before this and using it as a reason to quit.
---
I think the wolf potion from the Howl quest is a novelty now, too.
---
What else is in the store for 0 gems.. anet needs to make this more clear 
---
Very few people ever took note of the effects, but they were real.
---
Are you saying your 1 level from 80? If so, hell no it's not worth it. Save it for a new character.
---
Let's be honest, it's Deepstone. You'll end up hating yourself if you do it with or without instabilities.
---
Maybe this means map tiles on the API might finally get updated :O
---
It's okay, but it won't be particularly useful.  It's usually tankier gear which lacks offensive stats necessary to really learn &amp; thrive. 
---
You mean [like this](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/welcome-back-to-guild-wars-2-week-one/)?
---
I'm 8 levels from 80 &amp; I don't think I'm making another character...
---
Should be displayed when the player logs into the game or better yet have it automatically unlock onto the account when they log into the game we shouldn’t have to go searching through some forum posts to find out
---
Its called bag wars 2 because bad design makes you spend ages in bags. Invisible bags have always been more trouble then its worth. They break my workflow, and I end up spending more time in my bags
---
Hmmm, pretty sure you can return to where you were with the lily of the Elon too, might be wrong though !
---
Don't use it
---
I miss double casting Spectral Walk to cheese fall damage in dungeons
---
Here comes r/2007scape again
---
I totally forgot about the lava axe. Yeah, that kind of ruins the idea a bit. Still, I'd love to see them as kits like you suggested, especially if it meant I could camp lightning hammer more.
---
yeah it spawning those 2 mob birds was really the most troubling thing about the instab. but those 2 mobs by themselves weren't much of a problem, they were quite squishy and died easily enough, and didn't do much damage either. however when paired with bleed fire or last laugh or even outflanked/toxictrail/afflicted is the only time when they really became a problem. my entire point is that the only real demerit of the instability was that it made other instabilities worse. by itself i found the birds instab to be quite similar to the flux bomb instab (which i think is also a great instab) since it made you have to keep an eye out for it since ignoring it completely would be catastrophic but if you are aware of it dealing with it is quite easy and doesnt require much effort and if dealt with appropriately it won't have much lasting effect
---
It's a bit of a stretch/more abstract, but what about the whole Mordremoth/Sylvari-Thing? Might be an interesting new angle.
---
Oh, and also Praise Joko.
---
Really I'd suggest you just make a character and try them out, you can head to the PvP lobby where it boosts you to 80, gives you gear, and unlocks all skills while there. Lots of NPCs and targets to practice on. Also when you do use your level 80 boost it puts you in silverwastes and you can decide not to boost if you don't want (though the gear they give you is not what you want and you don't have an elite spec. I'd suggest looking at sites like [snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) to get an idea of raid builds or [dT](http://discretize.eu) for fractals (still needs to update). [Metabattle](http://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki) also has other builds to look through. 
---
Necro does have some stigma, mainly since there are a large number of casual players that get carried by minions while leveling so some more experienced players automatically dislike necros in groups. Also until recently reaper was pretty bad (the last patch buffed it but not a ton). So now reaper is a decent power DPS class in fractals and scourge is a good condi DPS class for raids (where it can ramp up), usually it's only meta on fights where you can spread conditions with [epidemic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Epidemic) (epi). So overall necro is a totally fine class to play and they are a meta power DPS as reaper, condi DPS as scourge, and even off healer with scourge. Oh and yes minion builds are pretty easy mode.
---
Weaver does have one of the harder rotations and also one of the higher benchmarks, again watch the video on the rotation and even try it if you want in PvP.
---
You can also check out resource links on my (in progress) [guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide).
---
Salvaging the unided gear [seems to just give you the average salvage](https://imgur.com/gallery/iazadQK), it is never worth it. You're better off IDing the gear then salvaging it for the random better drops.
---
What happens if you don't clean your bags for a bit, and the invisi bag starts getting full? I'll tell you, you double the time it takes to clean everything else.
---
Play alll the builds. They’re good for different things 
---
well, the important question now is how is the ecto droprate from rare unidentified gear? before you got more ectos from direct salvage because the elonian weapon droprate is (was?) low. Is it the same low one now for all unid gear? or is the droprate for elonian weapons back up because they reduce the chance of them dropping?
---
Everyone (well most) has felt like you do now. It will pass and you will get over it. Its one map of many and if you put inthe time and effort to figure it out TD is actually a really good map and really well put together. Its still really painful for the average player at first. 
---
Oh man... My raid team disbanded the other week. I'm gonna be sad if w7 is going to be Ahdashim :&lt;
---
Never used mesmer heroes and I still did 95% of the game easily
---
My personal ranking for the legi armors is light &gt; heavy &gt; medium. They went overboard with medium, it just looks bland out of combat and like a dragonscale christmas tree infight. I would have liked them to take a step back there and make it slightly simpler.
---
This actually happened to me this year after had no problem at all in the last 6-7 years 
---
My solution is 
---
Buy from 3rd party ( online )
---
The Bigger They Are...
---
I was expecting the requiem stories to be launched in 2 week intervals :feelsbadman:
---
shared slots
---
Fairly certain it's 4 weeks in between seasons.
---
Well, Kralkatorrik won in that regard that he killed the one thing that could prevent the destruction of Tyria and/or any living and magical being on the planet. Aurene was our last hope really because so far we found no alternative.
---
Aurene should replace and take over the slots of the Elder dragons, to act as a conduit to absorb and emit magic over time instead of increasing magic, the awakening of the elder dragons and the annihilation of any magical being.
---
So, with Aurene getting killed we are in a position in which we have used all of our options. The last line pretty much says it all "what do we do now? I don't know!"
---
&gt; who went 1v1 with a god
---
Not quite. Balthazar wasn't a god anymore. He was stripped of his power and recovered only a very small amount by absorbing the bloodstone explosion and some parts of Primordus and Jormag.
---
&gt; Maybe the strategy was good and it was just a bad luck moment
---
Or, maybe, it was how it should have been. Aurene gave us a vision of her getting killed over and over. Maybe that is how it is supposed to be for her to either evolve or for us to find the true meaning behind all of it.
---
&gt; I just feel like the point of the last story episode was to shock with Aurene's end. It feels kind of cheap.
---
I don't think so. But this is only something we can judge with the next episode. Depending on how it turns out it could have been a critical plot twist or just a shock moment.
---
For me, it was a great moment because so far we were untouchable. We killed Zhaitan without it affecting us much, we killed Mordremoth without any consequences, we got killed by a former god, reclaimed our soul and purpose and shrugged it off like it was nothing and then killed said former god and then going toe to toe with an Elder Dragon who wasn't starved from magic or assaulted through their weakness. And in the process we lost something very dear and critical to us in which we have been left with only questions.
---
The only time i recall my inventory filling up to the point where my invis bags start filling up is when i do HoT metas since they dump so much loot on you so quickly. It is so quick and easy to salvage all then dump mats to bank that most of my bag slots never get filled and can easily be done while running to the next event. Inventory cleanup is far easier to do now than it use to be, even more so with older content switching to unid gear. The only people with inventory issues anymore are hoarders.
---
No surprise.
---
Anet FTW
---
Right click -&gt; open all
---
The unid gear saves you the clicks you'd have to do during recs to get all of the trash out of your inventory. You know, the multiple salvage all, deposit all, etc
---
It did on initial release. But how many years ago was that?
---
I can see this as some kind of memory card game that can be played by childrens....
---
This is it, really. Just keep one stack of each rarity unidentified in an invisible bag.
---
HAHAHAHA WTF is going on there ahaha
---
Maybe for you. I am extremely happy this cancer got removed. Which I actually suggested on the day it was released, albeit in an overreacty-kind-of-way.
---
Personally I do it for the skins, which, while in general not exciting, are pretty unique and useful.
---
That's the issue in itself as well.. :(
---
Get more Slaying potions, slaying sigil weapons and CC consumables. The game shouldn't be balanced around max slot all 32 slot bag players
---
You are right but did that have any effect in the long run?
---
Tonn was IIRC only one part of the personal story and only when you decided to blow the ship up. Apparently you have three possible missions after [forging the pact](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Forging_the_Pact) of which only one leads to Tonns death in Tower down.
---
Though while we did lose the Pact we didn't really need them after that either because of the Alliance of the other Factions like Awakened, Olmakhan, Sunspears etc.
---
Yes, many have died or many things were left in ruins but so far I have not seen it having a real effect on us standing there and thinking "now what?". 
---
Think it's an asshole now...just wait until you have to do map completion on it for a leggy...if you stick around, that is ;-)
---
It takes them some time to respond to tickets, so  (sadly) best option is to wait.
---
i practically cant get more consumables, alternative gear, slaying sigils/potions on my necro, i even have demon+night, toilet paper and other "for fun" bundles. i have max slots but only one 32 bag from the story achiev. and i still have way more space than i need.
---
on my guard/slb i only have 1 bonus bag slot and still with sigils/pots/bundles i get either almost full or full inv by the end of t4 - depends if fractal drops a lot. 
---
also try to imagine now, as you say game is not designed for ppl with bag slots, you drop so many unid gear that when you open all, you get capped and then cant even do salvage all or the remaining unid gear will get salvaged too. thats even more mess
---
I just dont go there.... if i ever do, its foe meta event and i just mindlessly follow commander around and im fine
---
You my sir, are a legend!
---
Legendary and ascended items have same stats, only difference is QoL thing: you cannot change stats and sigils on ascended as fast and as easy as you can with legendary (it’s still possible). Luckily, as a warrior you only need axes with berserker stats, so you could just make 1 legendary+1 ascended berserker axe and transmute the legendary axe’s skin to the ascended one, so visually there would be no difference to the two of them. Also, you will want to put sigil of force into ascended axe cause that one is used in almost every situation and use legendary one if you need different sigils. And if meta ever changes and berserker stats suddenly become bad you can easily reforge your ascended axe to different stats, it costs less than 5-10 gold usually.
---
Will do either that or the leggy hammer. Thank you! 
---
Glint died. The Commander died. They're both still on course with the plan. Kralk is moving in and out of the mists. All the gods have left the world. What's stopping us from moving the battlefield to the mists?  
---
Also, she did eat Joko. Maybe she's just going to awaken?
---
The plan didn't fail. It just didn't work out quite the way we thought.
---
I was in a similar situation, started playing again 2 months ago. Picked mesmer didnt really feel it at 80 so I rerolled to ele. What I can tell you is this. Ele is very fun and flashy and rewarding.
---
But you will die alot, you are very squishy. And at the start it’s frustrating ad you learn all your skills and timings. Especially if you play weaver. Because while you have defensives they zte not always readily available due to having to switch attunements twice. So if you think you can handle the initial learning struggle go for it. Otherwise go necro is my advise. 
---
I did it with 20 unid gear to see how much I got screwed. Per 250 unid gear I had, on average, between 75-85 rare and 4-8 exotics. At 926% mf
---
Oh god more Roaring Ether.
---
Just releasevthe trailer at the end of the stream of episode 5. Makes total sense to me and is a fluid build up.
---
oh that will be expensive.
---
imagine being cataclawed while mounting a warclaw
---
* get a friend
---
* convince him to do the instance solo while you're counting the stones in the cave before the boss
---
* get AP
---
It's getting posted on reddit as well... 
---
I can't believe you skipped the mentors. They're our first great casuality in the war on Zhaitan, and probably the war on dragons as a whole
---
And poor Howl, if you're charr
---
Is that meant to be 'note that' or do you mean to say that it no longer works the same?
---
I looked into the resolution bit you were speaking of, and I found out the issue has to do with supersampling! When I switch to native, everything's normal. But when I switch back to supersampling, same issue again until I go into windowed mode and back again. Any idea how I could fix this?
---
If player lacks of shared slot or doesn't have invisible bags, it can also use bank - unpack some of unid gear, toss remaining stack to bank, salvage, take out remaining stack, unpack and salvage again
---
To clarify what op means: Dismount Warclaw and you instantly drop to the ground. Dismount Raptor and you do a little jump. Press jump and dismount on Warclaw and you do the little jump just like before the patch.
---
Note: Remove the keybind that spacebar is mount movement skill.
---
I might have to convince someone to do it for me after all 🤔
---
White Mantle + Wedding Attire (at least on human male); hood has quite common design of light armor head parts.
---
And again, everything is ok until you see the shoulders and you can't turn these out. 
---
BUT THINK OF THE CONTENT!
---
For real though, slippery slope was hilarious for about 20 minutes... then I stopped playing those days :P
---
Is it just me thinking or is the game dying? Seems like there's no new content a no plan for future one
---
Because it was a small living world episode that was doing set up for the next chapter 
---
Wait, *what*, you can skip it?! Granted, the last time I tried this achievement was probably over two years ago. I was just so fed up with that instance after getting hit by the ice in the literal last second I never went back in. I'll check it out again to see if it's not as annoying as before. Thank you for the detailed explanation!
---
Yeah, that sucks. :/ I hope they release the other pieces somehow. I really like the shirt and the pants that we got!
---
You done with raids and fractals?
---
Absurdly low. Becomes even more of a grind to get these.
---
So they have made copper and silver fed useless? 
---
God I hate how loot is done in this game...
---
You could ask if they refund you the 50%, most of the times they will do it, and then you can buy HoT with the extra money :)
---
Definitely should be "note that". It still works.
---
It was meant to say 'note' indeed.
---
Sadly i bought it from dlgamer emailed both gw2 and dlgamer, but dlgamer was unwilling to give a refund
---
You (and others) say that now. But imagine sliding, stopping to slide, sliding again... it's terrible. And stab can't even get close to perma uptime.
---
what does it have to do with account ?
---
u buy code from online shop aka 3rd party 
---
its the same code from Gamestop
---
Yeah how much of a group content, which is only possible with meta builds, is a  new player gonna have..
---
That sounds hilarious, yet oddly useful. There has to be some sort of counterplay, why not make it yarn? XD
---
Does no one else just salvage all their unidentified gear anyways? I can't be dealing with all that :P
---
Reading is hard, right? "map break in (...)". This is not a map break.
---
The current pace of content release/update  seems to be Living World Episode --&gt; Festival --&gt; Living World Episode --&gt; Festival -&gt; etc. Even if I agree that Festivals can't be considered 'new' for everybody they are still periodic content to fill some of the gap between episodes.
---
They are kinda trying to follow their cadence of delivery for the episodes and once Season 4 has ended they said they will be going directly for Living World Season 5 with the same cadence so future content is definitively planned.
---
Note that they also had big layoffs recently and need to do some restructuration internally (which could cause some short term disruptions) but seem to have started communicating more too.
---
I wear glasses so I actually find scourge hard to play...
---
Add spoiler warning dude
---
Can confirm it drops from dungeons.
---
Most of them
---
THANK GOD. I know we should want everything to be viable, but dying to condi just feels like you've been cheesed. Maybe I'm just still salty from the epidemic meta... but I'm much happier with power specs. And still in GvG immob plays a huge part
---
Also someone mentionned a bonfire to skip the instance to the boss, might be useful
---
Well ppl were using these to throw in the forge cuz ecto prices are shit
---
The layoffs are exactly the reason why I ask..
---
I know about their plans for season 5, but it seems like a while since they release last episode.
---

If you want to pvp, ele is very good at rotating the map and +1 murdering. Controlling the map. Team fights great dmg but if focussed you tend to blow up. Source: me playing it in pvp unranked
---
I am under the impression that they occasionally return for purchase with Black Lion tickets, never for the original price tho. Previously retired Skins also cycle through Black Lion chests every few months, which makes their price tend towards a more reasonable range usually.
---
Damn I'm drooling about that jetpack now. My Charr Engie needs it badly. I hope is 700~800 gem'ish instead of  random lootbox drop
---
1. no spectral grasp
---
2. serpents ire requires squad preparation; squad members should be emphasising the importance of hard CC throughout the tracking phase with suggested skills for each class/spec to take (which clearly you didnt have because you didnt take spectral grasp)
---
What can I do with these icons? Can they be used in the game? 
---
The only thing you lose by IDing first is time. It's free to ID, it can only improve the quality of the gear, and now that magic find isn't a factor unIDed gear is probably going to sell for less because it doesn't matter who opens it.
---
I never calculated but the first raid armor possibly still wins as you get the full precursor set for 100 cristalline and need 300 provisioner tokens afterwards compared to 20 grandmaster tokens. 
---
No one can help you. Obviously, there’s no match and you’re picky, so forgetaboutit. 
---
So, i decided to create Anise-like outfit for my fem mesmer and met a problem - I ve browsed wiki light armor skins, but didnt find any similar skin for chest and legs, probably you can help me in that. If you have ever created Anise cosplay in game please provide links for armor and screenshots of your outfits, thanks in advance \^\^ Here is the [link](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Countess_Anise.jpg) to see how she look in game&gt;!she is pretty sexy \^\^!&lt;
---
I know about **Exemplar Attire Outfit,** but I want exactly this type of robe and pants like she wears.
---
Also could you please suggest fashion wars topic, i guess this question is better apeal to people in it
---
Gorgeous work, thank you!
---
From the info we had it looks things went down very roughly this way:
---
* Before Anet had people working on Gw2 and a non negligible other bunch of people working on alternative projects
---
* NCSOFT told Anet to cut down on side projects because they were not making enough money and focus more back to Gw2
---
* Anet had to fire/let go quite a few people (don't remember the exact number) and stop the side projects
---
* Anet is now mostly focusing on Gw2 as far as we know
---
But because a lot of people are no longer in the company and they have to deal with people from existing Gw2 teams leaving and people from side projects coming back to Gw2 teams they need to do some reorganization which may add a bit of delay to the next episode but from what they communicating nothing changed in their plan to keep releasing the content they wanted to.
---
As for dates Episode 5 was release on January 8th so we are 2 weeks away from the 3 month mark (which will be in the middle of SAB) so I would expect an episode to drop not too long after the SAB Festival is over (it ends on April 18th). Their current release speed seem to go from 3 to almost 4 months so that would still fall in this window if the next episode is released after SAB (and if it comes a couple of weeks after I guess I could understand considering the situation).
---
Here's the thing about invisible bags. I have tried them multiple times. In the end, I found that I preferred straight normal bags.
---
The fact is I'm a flawed human being.
---
However, even if I was perfectly organized and on top of things all the time, invisible bags would still be a workaround and not a solution.
---
1. The need to keep either one of each rarity intact or to constantly move new stacks into a new slot. *This is not something we had to do prior to the update*
---
2. The need to equip multiple characters in this fashion. 
---
3. The lessening of the value of the hide bags feature, which allows a more concise inventory display. *Otherwise there is a bit of vagueness where the invisible slots start and where they end*
---
Now a whole new list of problems crop up if you go back to imperfect people like myself:
---
1. Running into the need to clear inventory in the middle of a zerg event or WvW, but then having to hesitate to hit the salvage all button.
---
2. Actually having the invisible bags, but accidentally having them fill with junk.
---
3. After cleaning out an invisible slot or two, not being able to locate the unidentified items within the mess.
---
4. Accidentally hitting the Salvage All button on the unidentified gear and wondering how many exotic items we missed out on.
---
And let me tell you, this kind of character flaw is permanent. It doesn't matter what you tell me to do, or what I tell myself to do. I will still make these organizational mistakes. I know of others who are way worse than myself.
---
Before the update, we had a system that worked for people like myself.
---
🥑🗿🍆
---
Nice job on these
---
Probably this this was already told, but have your sister tried to contact support? They might be able to help about these kind of inquiries
---
mesmer was my first boost candidate as it is chore to level it. necro and ele are fun to level with, i suggest against boosting ele
---
next thing might be engineer if you are going to skip all the hot and core specs.
---
now simple ting: do not join groups that you get shitted on by, esp. for such reasons. necro is a blast. it's the way of ~~life~~death. there is a lot of use, heal, reap, other kinds of support, dps is average, but good necro will outdps 80% of gw2 players.
---
Ele is love ele is life, but again, try to level it from the ground up, so you get used to it's specialties: *cough* squishiness  
---
None of them is a fixed caster, so you can go even for a guardian or a druid.
---
In the past it was always 2 different keys. However, buying the bundle means you'll have paid $10 for a PoF key you don't need. Selling the extra PoF seems like it could be a bit sketchy unless you find somebody desperate. If I can buy PoF for $15 directly from Anet, there's not much incentive to instead pay you $10 (or more) and hope I don't get scammed.
---
Yeah, 2 years later...
---
But, it's proven now that salvaging before ID loses profit in any way and loses potential skins. There's no benefit to IDing first and then salvaging. If anyone says it's beneficial for people with small bag space, those players can always break stacks of unid gear into smaller stacks to ID/unpackage.
---
Expansion keys are one time use only. If you redeemed it then you won't get it "unlinked" anymore.
---
However, I'm fairly sure you will get both keys if you buy the set and could just sell the additional PoF or use it on an Alt account.
---
&gt; are there any others besides Palawa Joko?
---
Palawa Joko isn't the rightful king of anything. The lore says he was the son of a diplomat, studied necromancy, and ended up as a power-hungry lich.
---
The rightful-king-returns doesn't really exist anywhere in GW2 because all of the potential heirs from the lore are accounted for and dead.
---
Try to get any squad for map completition or hp train. You will unlock most wp and will be easy for you to explore it
---
"In the past it wad always 2 keys" so it is 1 key now or is it still 2 keys
---
Dont worth to waste a tasty boost for 8lvls.
---
You can't start a dismount mid-air.
---
You'd have to start a a dismount and a jump almost at the same time so the dismount ends at the end of a jump, like with dodge-jumps. 
---
There's probably no way to disable that, if as I suspect the mid-air check can only be at the start of skills.
---
If they can't put another mid-air check at the end of the dismount to cancel it before it ends mid-air, then they'll have to lower the jump height of the warclaw until dismount-jump shenanigans no longer work.
---

are you sure? :)

Until he posts here specifically saying opposite of what he's specifically said this entire time, yes I'm sure.
---
If you see suspiously cheap gem codes they are most likely bought with stolen credit cards. You buy this code, redeem code, credit card owner demands a charge back, anet charges money back and your account gets banned. 
---
I don't see max slots as realistic for the average player, tbh. But maybe it is? I don't know.
---
On my fractal weaver I have a full 32 slot bag with the consumables and extra weapons, with 20 slot bags in the other slots and no additional slots that inventory was full after every daily rec. I had to work through different types of (champ) bags that gave more euipment that took up slots. Now those give unid gear as well which just stacks with the rest.
---
Invisible bags, that's what dfferent bag types are for. Open as much as you can, deposit the mats you dropped after, salvage after depositing
---
Shiny metal to attract a raven?
---
It's usually 2 weeks between seasons. It's not a concrete number though. Sometimes there's a little swing in either direction.

Starting your journey to take down the Elder Dragons, huh?

This is GW2 and super easy to have more then one character and something most of us have so we can swap to what we need, the group need, or what ever you feel like playing that day. Most things are accountbound in GW2 so you will also make more then one character for sure ;)

Just get safe slots that hide the gear from the salvage kits:
---
* Shared slots.
---
* Invisible bags.

* Invisible equipment bags.

Thanks. My friend is watching this thread now and taking notes. :)

Hi all! I am playing Mesmer and I recently started getting into PvP. For now I have been playing a number of Condi Mirage variants but I would love to try Chrono as well. I am looking for the most "forgiving" build to play (or start with) in PvP as a Mesmer. A build that will enable me to defend myself efficiently and at the same time be able to land some kills here and there, so I can get used to the pace of the Arenas (like positioning, knowing when to stun and dodge, when to run away and so on). Any suggestions and recommendations are much appreciated!
---
Cheers!
---
Then you have missunderstood Elementalist. It is not played in that way. Elementalists are all attunaments included and you use them in different ways through rotation, game mode, combos, builds and so on. You don't just pick one and then make a build to it. 
---
For the record, the drop rate seems to be abysmal. I tried both Frostgorge and down in Orr, and in the equivalent amount of time I got 1 green and 1 blue unidentified. That's it.  
---
So yeah, not changing my routine.
---
Do the story, do the meta eventsin HoT and then pre events. And use boosters and food. This adds up a lot and you can earn tripple the xp just by adding food, fireworks and the 15% oils. 
---
My friend is running a support scourge on our fractal runs, but he can't keep 25 might and he told me it's because of Oppressive Collapse not always giving might. I never played scourge seriously so I wouldn't know what's wrong. Does anyone know anything about this? What should he do to be able to get 25 might as a scourge? 
---
Enemies, chests in content under level 80, champion bags, master and rare gear bags, WvW/PvP reward containers and story reward bags will still produce scaled drops.
---
Your guildies were probably trying to open unid gear with low level characters. Unid gear is elvel 80 only, so it will only produce level 74-80 drops. 
---
Can somebody pls ping wp 
---
I find it abit bs that the newest (runecrafters)  salvage tool cost less than the silver but brings more profit, talk about pay to win
---
I just purchased the collection and only received a single key for both expansions.
---
That’s a lot of work, thank you!
---
Oh okay ty, damn guess i cant sell an extra copy of pof
---
Is there any specific reason why you need two legendary stat sticks? You can transmog a legendary appearance indefinitely. 
---
Protip: if you're making a 2-handed gen 2 don't make the shards directly.  Instead make shards for any gen 2 off-hand and then convert them from 100 Off-hand shard to 75 2-hander shards via the Enormous Chest of Legendary Shards recipe.
---
Birds had multiple problems:
---
\- The mob birds are "wasting" AoE Damage. On mob intensive fractals like sirens reef you cannot easily waste a high damage AoE on Trash Mobs like the birds
---
\- They made the chrono pull pretty useless bc of the bird mobs
---
\- You couldn't prevent getting the downsides of the birds. You will always get a minimum of one blind and if it's hit while you can't need it (chrono pull for example) it's gone and you couldn't do anything to counter that. You didn't get a hint in any form that you are getting the birds in the next 2 seconds or so
---
\- The birds are doing 1k Damage. With an elementalists with a life of 11k that hit's really hard if you need to wait for your endurance bar to refill.
---
\- If you transfered the birds to the enemy, the mob birds are still foes and the enemies don't care about 1k with their healtpool
---
And yeah, it is even worse with other instas
---
OH WELL I MOUNT YOUR M... Oh... Ooooh...
---
I mean, i did it prepatch.
---
Yes he does have all the material to craft another one. But the recipe in your crafting is locked after finishing it the first time. You can make the first tiers of weapons but when you will get to Prototype you will find "This item can be crafted only once" .. or something like that. 
---
Hey thanks for the tip! I've included a document now in the folder which should explain a lot of things. Also included a CC 4.0 License. Perhaps you can give me some additional feedback. :)  
---
Wait, so you wan't me to reduce my already smallest effective modern mmo inventory space by 20 - 32 in order to solve a problem that shouldn't exist?
---
Ohh ... ok ... Has anyone tried it Post patch WITH MF maxed? I am very curios of the results.
---
&gt;Guardian
---
You mean the God of core classes for open world?
---
Did that once, got the daydreamer's finery lol. Looks surprisingly good on my darker asura.
---
Back in the beta you could only identify gear at heart vendors in PpoF. So there was reason to salvage all for convinience.
---
And this is also just a game. Playing something you hate isn’t the point of a game
---
I'm looking at the fractal build for scourge heal/support [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Scourge\_-\_Support\_Healer](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Scourge_-_Support_Healer). They propose 2 variance: full heal (magi) and hybrid (shaman + marshal). Gearing full magi is easier for me but I'd like to know in practice, which variance tends to be more favored / helpful.
---
Pretty and elegant
---
Just a wording clarification, he wants to lower the resolution not downscale. 
---
Downscaling is taking a higher source and scaling it onto  slower display, the opposite of upscaling. In this case downscaling would mean running a resolution higher than 4K, not a good idea considering the PC couldn’t even handle 4K. 
---
Fyi, there is an option to hide your own name in game. :-P
---
right, "was." Wouldn't it be fairly simple to remove code/functionality for salvaging? Does anet think salvaging unids serves any beneficial purpose?
---
Strange... that's really annoying. Heh, and I was about to start in on HOPE again. So much for getting Twice Told off that one.
---
2 SW runs. Open All, Salvage All, and 320 bag slots make it pretty easy. The only issue is the *insane* lag I get after opening and salvaging a few stacks. We're talking game slowing down to 1-3 fps! This is due to the infinite stream of items that start scrolling on the right of my screen. There is no way to stop the stream other than changing maps, which would ofc kill my MF bonus. It's likely due to the CPU being old. Haswell at 4.2Ghz. 
---
Dunno, save it if you want to, but don't expect a comeback. Minmaxing will always be stronger.
---
But does the 4th channel work!? 
---
What’s with all the invisible comments?
---
Scourge can use celestial in WvW.
---
People keep saying things about leaving fights on points every time a conversation on sPvP comes up but it was always my experience that if I tried to do that I'd have at least one player just follow and kill me anyway.
---
And of course there was that one time where I kept getting ganked by two thieves the moment I tried to do anything whatsoever, decided I was less of a liability to my team if I stayed inside our base where I at least wasn't feeding the enemy team free points, and promptly got flamed by everyone for leeching.
---
Don't get me wrong, I was terrible at the game mode, but that kind of thing really didn't help me learn it.
---
First maybe check if her pc is free of spyware. Also, does she use any addons?
---
Oh... they’re not going to require Challenge mode for the Annual meta-achieve are they?
---
Good point. I was trying to think of a solution that won't make the warclaw feel worse for players. 
---
It's the same for those who have bag openers, and almost the same for those who don't.
---
Durability Runes are still great. I'd even recommend them to a returning player as they make you harder to take down
---
My guess is one of the Ubuntu releases.
---
Have you blocked some users from here?
---
Do tier 2 fractals require a specific build / team composition or is like tier 1 with extra mechanics?
---
I tought op wanted just that 2 attunements
---
Celestial Scourge is a thing in WvW.
---
I personally wouldn't run Celestial on a Heavy character at the moment. Minstrel as others have said, or Diviners depending, would be way better routes to take on your Heavy armor. I understand the fear in replacing the stats as it takes days to get just 5 Charged Quartz to remake insignias, but at least for Heavy armor classes, I highly doubt Celestial will see a comeback
---
Would be cool to have actual moai statues as decorations too
---
Login doesn’t have anything to do with dailies, it’s all on a timer that currently resets at 8pm EST.
---
It would be more beneficial for you to log in as soon as the event starts in order to get your dailies done before 8pm reset time, and then you can do it again afterwards.
---
Im just waiting for new legendary Coalescence to be released. Pristine Brandsparks are made with Crystal Lodestones which are made with crystal cores...crystal cores will shoot up in price because some Arse will buy them all out with his hoarded riches, then flip them for 1 gold a piece...the world will be in chaos!
---
Honestly, I've "expected" brandsparks to shoot up since the release of PoF. Originally expected them to be required for gen 2 legendaries made with desert materials.. but ANET still wants you to use Amalgamated gemstones for that. Then, I expected a lot of them to be required for Coalescence in order to revitalize PoF metas, since they have a guaranteed brandspark per day. But the stupid ring is still unfinished. Though I suspect the next episode, if it does come with a raid, and if raid is above Vabbi, as the datamined map changes suggest, we may still see a legendary ring, LS4 legendary accessory, and last gen 2 legendary weapon all in one episode... too hopeful?  lol
---
They are shadowbanned I guess? 
---
In all honesty I would strongly advice against playing support scourge for Fractals if you plan on playing T4s. While it does offer a lot more survivability than Druid does, it will never beat a Druid as far as offensive buffs go (Frost Spirit, Spotter, 25 Might etc.) 
---
Storage expander is what I am looking for, unless I missed it 
---
Yeah, also they're easier to get than Monk, so may suit better for the headstart.
---
Just go for minstrel. 
---
**Almost no pug will take a heal scrapper in raids or fractals. No matter what gear you use.**
---
Thats the sad truth of affairs in PvE. Anyway the only reason you ever want harrier is because minstrel gives you toughness and makes you tank some bosses in raids.
---
Besides that Minstrel is all arround just the better statset. All the stats compliment each other perfectly. And scrapper doesn't have much use for the boon duration of harriers in PvE because the few boons you can put out are almost negligible. 
---
&gt; Give it a try, or just "save it on you bank", but swaping stats ain't expensive anymore, would be a better choice.
---
Except in the case if he would want to swap back to celestial.   
---
On the off chance that celestial will be viable on any of the plate classes, I'd just save the gear set in my bank. Easier to craft a new ascended set than regret stat changing later. 
---
Except in WvW which is a play mode that rewards versatility. 
---
Not yet! Still a few days left.

Great! My username is foozlesprite.8051. Add me to friends and hit me up sometime when you see me on. Even if I don't have friends online for us to do a fractal at the time, I can give you an overview of the fractal system and how it works.
---
Did the math, at the current profit rate you would need to salvage 54.2k items before you profit assuming you convert gold to gems
---
Oh bummer, you think so because of SAB? I was hoping to get a few chances at an Etherbound Package with discounted keys.
---
Well, it is basically single player, you can solo the entire game with Henchmen and Heroes. Even with less than ideal classes and builds, like Rangers.
---
The UI might be old, but it's pretty simple, if you have any troubles the other subreddit can help you out.
---
If you want to play healing scourge in fractals you will have to most likely provide might so full magi probably won't do. 
---
Celestial gear will never be a thing in endgame pve. It's great for duelist and roamer classes in spvp and wvw.
---
Hmm for me it's not really worth buying rcsom then. Also happy cake day
---
The only important things that have not been on sale yetare copper fed and material bank expansion. Chill.
---
That would be a great feature.
---
Well that and allot of the FB abilities are conal in effect with a very narrow area.
---
This means any movement really screws with them.
---
I tell you what Anet, I’ll sell you my Transmutation charges, bank access expresses, trading post expresses, merchant expresses, repair canisters, makeover kits, and upgrade extractors for 1 gem each.  That’s like 99% off for all of them.  
---
What a steal!
---
;\^)
---
You *do* have to add a screenshot to your statement. Of the character, not the charges
---
What's the point of having a title if I can't see it?
---
It reviewed well out of the box, but people very quickly fell off of it. The temporary events didn’t help.
---
you cannot see the backback, but it is the simple scribing one and I got the bubble auras from SAB
---
I pretend it is sparkling energy as she's a elementalist
---
Lol I’ll do that when I get home. Don’t have any pics on my phone 
---
A harrier druid is probably less niche than a harrier firebrand. The thing with the firebrigade setup is that is has more dps (and cc) than a chrono+druid setup while providing the same buffs (assuming you have a soulbeast with frost spirit). Both firebrand and renegade should be dps (viper or berserker/diviner for firebrand and diviner for renegade). You can run 1 of the 2 as healer but it is more efficient to have the rene as a healer not only because it has more sustain healing but also more burst healing. Technically tome2 has more burst but in full harrier you HARD overheal making it less efficient. Pressing natural harmony on your rev once does the same job on lower cds. If you are playing harrier firebrand you kind of want the renegade to be power and not heal whereas if you played a berserker/diviner firebrand you can pair with both dps and heal alacrigades.
---
If you are doing fractals you can pretty much use your power dh build and play quickbrand already, no need for new gear but you definitely need different gear for a druid vs soulbeast. The power dh build is also a good starting point for making a quickbrand for raids.
---
With all that being said, you should play the class that you want to play and enjoy more. Whats the point of gearing up a class you don't want to use? It is easier to get into groups as a druid than a firebrand healer as 1 druid is meta in pugs and while having 2 druids is not optimal it is not the end of the world. You can split spirits and run 2 goe (on power bosses). So if you want to join a pug as a healer, it is easier if you just play druid because if they are playing solohealer they probably want a druid and if they are duohealers they could already have an offhealer and thus want a druid.
---
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!
---
Become an ANet partner and talk about this on a stream. You’ll get their attention.
---
Probably too late, but this is more than likely spyware/browser hijacking. @rocketmail is a temporary email domain so the person is likely a scammer 
---
Just remove the RNG from unidentified gear and give us more rare/exotic gear..
---
Crafting HOPE starting from the precursor is only 247g cheaper than crafting two Quips ... getting an additional pistol for only 247g seems like a much nicer deal.
---
I like hiding my title but putting my discord push to talk hotkey to the same thing as "Show Name" hotkey. Now whenever I talk in discord my gw2 name shows up
---
it might be easier, though i'd rather have them stop with the lazy band aid fixes, and instead do proper fixes. yes it's more effort, but we are also talking about some spots that have been problematic since launch, and the amounts of oddly placed invisible walls and bandaid fixes that turned out to not work is really cringy by now.
---
Thanks for the answer, I think I may switch stats and even if it comes back, I hopefully have my leg armor by then.
---
This went over my head.
---
ಠ\_ಠ
---
Despite the costs, 15 is not even close to being a good sample size to determine whether (either) ecto gambling is profitable.
---
It's also an infinitely better game 
---
There is still a reason to open with MF in SW: Envelopes, HoT containers, and PvP/WvW chests. So for now, I'll keep my MF boosted character there.
---
I personally run Celestial stats in armor only for my Weaver in WvW, but only because I am almost always playing alongside my bf who's running meta Mirage, the goal being to provide both of us with some sustain so that he can focus on kill potential. If I didn't play almost exclusively alongside him or while zerging, I wouldn't run Celestial, however. It's a niche circumstance.
---
But as for Heavy, I can't really think of any reason to keep Celestial stats, period.
---
*Booooooo*
---
I'm a Spellbreaker main in PVP, and when I leave a losing fight, my biggest priority (even more than staying alive) is kiting the enemy away from my teammates. Usually that means taking them toward far (if they already own it) so my teammates can deal with mid or recapping home or finishing a mechanic like ringing the bell or carrying the orb. If there are two people attacking me, I'll even use my "Vengeance" skill in order to keep them attacking me and not my team. True, I can count the times I rallied off that on one elbow, but it is a good distracting technique, I think. 
---
If you like gambling you should try mystic forging precursors instead.
---
Whenever I play in PoF maps with my friends I have to say TO VABBI! Otherwise it’s not the same feeling
---
oh, these are super rad and i love them all ♥
---
Oh, haha--I didn't see it!  It's alright, I got it--it took about 10 hours, but I got it!  Thanks very much for the response--back to Tyria!
---
Can we just make it so identifying gear isn't better than directly salvaging it without identifying?  This is all so stupid and pointless.  
---
Good Job, Lightbringer! Have an \[apple cider\].
---
Thank you commander. 
---
this was the main reason i was doing key farm weekly. I was lucky got both etherbound package and exalted shoulders 
---
There is a benefit to it: To identify, clock up your inventory multiple times and redo the whole process over and over again takes time. Time some peeps don't want to spend. Inventory managment was doable beforehand but still many players complaint rightfully that it is a tedious task destracting from the gameplay. It is the same with id vs not to id. If you don't mind the loss than why should anet disable the function for players that want it quick or are very short on bag space? Options are not a bad thing. An not every option has to befor every player.
---
I almost had respect for you and then you dropped that last line.
---
As far as being banned for it. There was a dev who checked it out and gave it a go ahead. Obviously any harm done by the mod is your own risk (there appears to be none).
---
As for the performance. I was mostly looking into the relative performance with my specific setup. I am very well aware gw2 runs better on a higher single core speed than multicore setups. If however the percentage increase is similar to mine it should still be a pretty big boost on your end as well.
---
If you happen to check it out, please let me know how it turned out :)
---
PvP is a great source...sooo many from reward tracks.
---
&gt; isn't a massive dick
---
it's not a dick move to refuse to accomodate the "dps" player in celestial gear lmao
---
IMO the story achieves gets better and better. They add a lot more achieves to do during an episode. They also give you way more AP than in previous episodes during HoT.
---
The issue people didnt complete this main achieve is because you need to complete 33 achieves while some episodes didnt even had more than 30 achieves in total.

Create a a second account, and activate PoF on it. Use the account to just login on everyday to earn some Mystic Coins.
---
while it really does not matter when you play alone, going / doing something like this will leave you as deadweight in any groupcontent.  
---
you will be that one person that deals not even 1% damage to the HP of any of those bosses, be it openworld meta events or dungeons or other groupcontent.  
---
elementalist is meant to be played with a rotation between all attunements to get most out the heavy hitting skills while some kind of aoe is going on at the same time when you are stuck autoattacking.  
---
same applys to traits...you said you want a critheavy build but at the same time you completly neglected the fire traitline which has really high damage modifiers and choose a traitline which benefits more the support type. same applys to the water attunement itself...most skills on any weapon in water are more the support styled skills and even old builds like pure elementalist which was played with staff took advantage of that damage trait in water in terms of NOT using water skills while being in water and rather use icebow or some sort of other conjoured weapon.  
---
so all in all you should really rethink on how to play elementalist, because the idea you have from it right now is simply bad.
---
I recently installed this as did my friend.  I have more of a budget/med range pc that got a pretty nice ~25%+ fps boost sometimes more, while his got a very little boost with his high end pc but did improve load times slightly for him so it is still better than without.

With the sales already featured one salvage-o-matic, I don't expect to see the copper one during this sales

Top 10 WvW Tips No One Will Tell You

I'm not really interested in PvP but I did some WvW to get the mount and it was fun.
---
I'll have to check out weekly key runners, I guess it refers to doing personal story with temporary characters to get BL keys? I have 2 unused character slots.
---
Good to hear that you got some pretty decent improvements. So far pretty much everyone seems to have gotten at least minimal improvement. I think it's pretty safe to say it's almost a no brainer to install unless the lack of other 3rd party tools hurts you.

Thanks for sharing :)

i think i gonna do some blue and rare unids next so keep an eye out for a new post tonight or tomorrow.

Time to get back into fractals!! 
---
No other class has a passive aegis just sitting there, giving it the ability to easily disengage after getting hit with a projectile from a random enemy they didn't know was aggroed on them.
---
It is very easy to make d912pxy to work with arcdps. Basically if you manually install the d912pxy files you have to rename the d3d9.dll that belongs to d912pxy to d3d9\_chainload.dll and paste it besides the usual .dll files in your game directory. This means the d3d9.dll that comes from installing arcdps stays the same.
---
If you install the mod using the installer.exe then you will be asked at some point if you want to chainload or not (or a similar question, I can't remember).
---
Arcdps and this mod function well together (no issues).
---
Maybe not for PvE, but it was a really long time meta for guard in wvw, maybe it will come back.
---
So what, we've accepted that cookie-cutter outfits aren't going anywhere, and *actually fully mixable* armour skins are a thing of the past?
---
I won't care if outfits can mix helmets with other outfits; they are still *outfits*, and I'm neither buying nor wearing them unless they're [unmixable one-piece skins](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Wedding_Attire_Outfit) that couldn't exist otherwise.
---
WvW has the best kind of idiots.
---
Nothing has changed with champ bags. The only change affects lvl 80 gear.  
---
Lower level characters still get lower level gear in the same methods they did pre-patch.
---
So yes, keep the toon for opening bags.
---
&gt; It makes no sense and is honestly just takes up space.
---
6x3 pixel is no space...
---
Ahahah they are using the opening of bandit chests to boost their magic find 150%.
---
Whilst it technically raises the maximum MF, that is unbelievable cancer to do for large openings to the point where I'd consider it unrealistic.
---
It's cool and all they did that to boost their MF but I personally don't include that in adding up max magic find as you'll be pressed to find people willing to do that for their openings but if you want to include as a factor in max magic find, go ahead.
---
Last year they also did silver and copper on different days
---
"No issues" isn't quite true. The crash rate raises dramatically.
---
Without ArcDPS I get maybe one crash a day? *Maybe.*
---
With ArcDPS I get one crash an hour, if not more.
---
No, that's themepark. 
---
You can ride the roller coaster, or you could go check out the lazy river.
---
You can go pvp, or you can go do some pve metas.
---
See the similarities?
---
In the current pug meta (which I'm assuming OP will need), you'll always find a druid because spirits, spotter, and easy boons. I know what you mean, but for others' sake and for OP I'm going to clarify. Firebrigade replaces the secondary healer in a 2 healer comp (most optimally, with the ren being heals), NOT the druid. Yes, that second healer can be a second druid, but even most pugs I see prefer a different 2nd healer.
---

&gt;We're working on a fix for the issue where people can get stuck on their mount, and still have their 3 evades and such. There may be more than one bug that causes this, but we think we're getting the most egregious one. - Done 3/26
---
Still getting this bug, not in WvW but Bitterfrost. Annoying.
---
They'll at least have to get in close range and won't be permanently stealthed. It's a decent "nerf" to broken builds.
---
Does your brain start smoking when you  watch for gankers while also using wasd and the dodge button?
---
Because they want mounts to be used to get from point A to point B, not to completely change the gamemode.
---
It's true that most tanks have the _option_ to reach any toughness they need to. That doesn't make them _happy_ to do so, though. The tank will be lowering their own damage output, and they'll be doing so to make up for _you running a lower-damage gear set as well_. It doesn't help that Diviners gear has higher concentration than Minstrels, which means a Chronotank will be lowering their boon output as well as their damage to make up for you running a weird stat set.
---
I consider an exotic set of meta gear to be a pretty fair requirement before you enter raids. If you show up on a DPS that's supposed to be running Vipers/Berserkers/Grieving and tell me that you've instead got Celestial and need me to up my toughness, I will politely yet firmly tell you to correct your build before raiding with us again.
---
thanks for the info. I knew what was wrong with it but somehow didnt think of just copying the comment and add the spaces quickly myself.
---
You should get used to activating skills with keys instead clicking the skills.
---
If you are not looking at the skill bar, the skill bar can't bother you. 
---
I wish I could hide anything but the health orb myself.
---
So remove instant-finishing on downed enemies. That's been a huge game-changer. 
---
The irony of people who complain about roamers ganking meanwhile 98% of the time those roamers are getting run down by 32 pugs all mounted up always makes me laugh. The worst gankers are the pugs. 
---
Yeah some people make a new character, get them to level 10, then do the first stage of the personal story which awards a black lion key.  This can be done once per weekly reset. 
---
Map completing a city or 2 with these characters will also net you some transmutation charges if you really need them.
---
Thanks for the feedback. 
---
As mentioned, I separated the rare unidentified gear stacks from the other 2 types. 550 exotics all came from rare gear. The other 33 were from fine+masterwork which i had no intention of identifying in the first place, but had various amounts lying around on characters. My goal was number of exotics as that is what equals precursor chance. 
---
&gt; We know there are still several areas people can break in to keeps/towers or otherwise get to places you shouldn't be able to. If you find one, please don't post them on the forums. You are welcome to send them to me in a PM here or discord. We'll be fixing these as we find them. Many will probably be able to be fixed whenever we find a fix for the other ways to jump upon dismount.

Always enjoy these kinds of videos. They provide inspiration and help to show what your class can do when played by an expert. Good job.
---
Really? Because [the wiki](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC7WFw42VnywQRvewSq29eg) shows that both of them have never gone on discount during the same March sale.
---
But muh executioner's axe is combat related :^)
---
Very cool, ty! What are you running GW through, proton?
---
For the short jaunts between some nodes, it's more convenient than raptor or jackal, I've found, when those two mounts tend to overshoot the target and cause me to have to backtrack
---
I have all mounts mapped to my mouse so I swap to whichever gets me to the next node in the easiest path/least clicks, and Warclaw fits that in some very tight areas
---
&gt; My goal was number of exotics as that is what equals precursor chance.
---
precursors had a significantly lower droprate than regular exotics, though.
---
&gt; Here's a thought: check the post they just made regarding this "issue" :)
---
Sorry I didn't saw the post before posting this. I already deleted it, thx for the notice
---
The point is to provide less spent down time while running back, without flooding the place with respawn points.
---
It definitely gives an edge to defenders streaming in over attackers already there.
---
&gt; If they add traps, unmounted "tricks", mounted "tricks," and even possibly a break bar, why even have the mount at that point?
---
They added mounts because the non-WvWers would enjoy them and come to WvW. Then they caved in because the veteran WvWers didn't want to see their game changed and cried loud enough.
---
Ah, also, Gemstore skins.
---
Same on 1.8.9  :/
---
The subtitles was a nice plus, and also necessary in some parts.
---
thanks :)
---
I don't understand why everyone is cool with being forced to use invisible bags if they want a guarantee against accidental salvaging. When you do this, you have to choose between losing bag slots by going with a cheap smaller bag, or buying a very expensive high capacity bag - and then only a few slots actually have the unids, while the rest of the bag fills with random stuff you can't salvage or sell without manually salvaging or moving each item to another bag. This is a really inadequate solution. It makes much more sense to remove unids from the "salvage all" table and then if you want to you can use the "salvage stack" option directly. 
---
good, but not enough.
---
* a reduction of run speed to 392 U/S is needed (this is OOC with swiftness on foot). currently the warclaw still runs too quickly.
---
* the dismount mounted skill should replace the instant stomp, instead of being an extra skill.
---
* warclaw breakbar is only relevant as a way to dismount a target while on foot using a CC skill. if this can be done without a breakbar, then that's good enough.
---
* the gate pull ability needs to be adjusted so that it is not useless.
---
* the warclaw should be available to all players in WvW, even free2play players. it is powerful enough to be considered pay2win. while we're at it, make gliding available for all players in WvW as well. no sense in restricting the microtransaction audience to just expansion owners.
---
Wew I hope this is /s because life is gonna be wayyyy too tough for you with that attitude. 
---
Sadly, most people have accepted that thats not going to happen, and with outfits being around for so long, its unlikely that it will change how they are handled, especially reworking older ones. i can understand that there are ones that could not work as regular skins, like the one that changes your legs, or some of the dresses maybe. But damn, some other could've been sold as regular skins just as well.
---
The Charr are actually vegetarian.
---
Happened to me twice on two mounts within 1 minute. Also on Bitterfrost. Before my beetle bugged out the speedboost did not work.
---
Tofutoberfest? 
---
The reason is the same as why people still use stealth in WvW regardless of a fact that it's available to just few classes and similar reveal traps, tricks, and even skills exist.
---
Did someone say CAPES?! xD
---
Because there is no customizable interface or hotbars in this game. That's why you get to have every button exactly where the developers placed it, and not where you'd think it would best suite your style. 
---
I've seen a lot of memes about her. Does she really make random HP characters gay?
---
Jennah and Caudecus had an 'intense' sexual relationship.
---
&gt; Elite specs are pay2win too following your logic.
---
the keywords are "powerful enough".
---
i can compete in WvW just fine without elite specs, since there are a number of powerful builds that use core specs only.
---
the same is not true for the warclaw. it is such a huge upgrade that it places players with it on a completely different level.
---
Stealth is a class mechanic. These mounts should *not* be restricted by class. What even is your point?
---
Would the [Loltools SW](https://silverwastes.loltools.net/) site be useful for this? Currently it says 2.09 silver / item, which is more than double than the profit of just selling blue unid gear on the TP.
---
It's still meatoberfest, but the "false" in "false meatoberfest" is implied.
---
unless I overlooked something, that site doesnt reference unid gear in any way but champion bags.
---
same method they went with for GvG areas
---
you are fucking joking, right?
---
i have been playing WvW since 2013. i can count the number of times that i've been successfully ganked on one hand. this is across all sorts of builds, including roaming builds, havoc builds, frontliner builds, full-glass backline builds.
---
if you are getting popped so often by gankers that it's becoming problematic, i think the problem lies with you, no the gankers.
---
again not true, warclaw just give you an option of faster transportation as well, some mobile classes can move as fast if not faster then warclaw, calling the mount p2w is just to big exaggeration... if anything gliding is more crucial then warclaw in my opinion in some situations of course. 
---
https://youtu.be/e3F84FOi-20
---
I wish our teamspeak came with subtitles sometimes haha
---
As far as I'm aware, the game rolls twice when an exotic drops. Once to determine if you'll get an exotic, and again to determine if said exotic will be a precursor.
---
Thanks for your comment. I do fully agree. While in some instances the difference between the versions might be blown out of proportion due to    
---
"lucky" runs, the average displays a very solid improvement across the board.
---
Also about the benchmarking tool. Unfortunately i had pretty much all benchmarks done by the time i found out about it. Didn't really feel like repeating the same benchmarks even more times (planning your day around world bosses can be rather tricky).
---
Since people have requested me to use both this and a different benchmarking tool (forgot the name, comment was recently submitted by someone) i might look into making 1 or 2 more videos displaying similiar tests with these benchmarking tools.
---
&gt; Yikes, buy the damn expansions and contribute to this game you've apparently been playing for free since 2013 dude. Why should Anet concern themselves with your opinion at that point anyway if you aren't going to pay towards their product?
---
i have the expansions, as well as multiple paid accounts and gemstore purchases.
---
i also happen to be concerned about the state and balance of the game, so i will voice those concerns and give suggestions on how to solve them. if you don't want to listen, then go away.
---
&gt; And beyond that, wouldn't just adding mount rentals for all players regardless of expansions be a better solution rather than nerfing it into the ground for YOUR sake?
---
alternatively, anet can spare the programming work needed to implement mount rentals, and just unlock it for all players.
---
ah yes, logging in once a year since 2013 allows me to somehow get over 1000 WvW ranks.
---
go back to your zerg, zergling.
---
This isn’t a new communication policy. He did this last year with his vague plans for pvp. Half of which never happened. Which is fine. But we need to stop heralding this as some kind of clear communication we haven’t seen before. 
---
1. I HATE when Anet has a specific list of achievs for Mastery with no extras to choose from.
---
2. I HATE when Anet doesn't include checkpoints for story instances (unless they're really short).
---
Thanks for the suggestions. I will look into these tools. Unfortunately i'm not too familiar with these so i will have to read up on them. It might be time to put Afterburner + rivatuner on the shelf if it turns out it's not optimal anymore. At least not when trying to see specific improvements.
---
If it's not faster than running then there's no point in using it...
---
I appreciate Ben so much although I know it's a team effort but his constant communication with us over this has been so refreshing. It makes my feelings against the Warclaw more manageable to know he is trying to listen to our feedback.
---
ohh aparently my world is twisted, as it is not flat like yours is... and my thief has to be buged as I can easly keep up with warclaw players, even outrun them, I have at least 5 cc immunes in a row, at least 5 dodges in a row, multiple leaps longer then 600 that I can spam and can insta stomp down players tooo... hmmm 
---
I was trying to, but you kept whining like an old man that this mode isn't what it used to be and demanding these changes get nerfed into the ground because they don't sit well with you specifically, and here we are :)
---
That would certainly make more sense than S4E6 - it isn't exactly the most relevant location for wrapping up the current story arc.
---
And that gets them sales...how, O' Wise One?
---
I guess with "rats" he meant the skritt in Brisban Wildlands, the original ecto gambling place
---
1k gems i'd be fine with that
---
(same for guild slots)
---
... gemstore skins?
---
are you just being purposely belligerent, or are you actually as stupid as you appear?
---
don't bother answering. i already know.
---
That would make sense, and considering how long E6 has been brewing I'd honestly be a little worried if they missed such a golden opportunity. As for the map changes, I'm betting on that being the location of a new Raid - the location doesn't really make sense for wrapping up our current story arc, but going to another Djinn-themed area for the next wing would be a nice logical progression.
---
So it's an attempt of be present in the media / in people's mind.
---
And there it is, the old man comes out. Let me guess your server now too...
---
I would be ok with 2k per slot if it would be account-wide
---
i am flattered by your continued admission of defeat. feel free to keep admitting defeat.
---
Makes me kinda wish we got new Skimmer masteries making him able to dive underwater
---
Grandad put down the knife this isn't Vietnam!
---
&gt; CC + Sniped by one-trick pony build
---
Possible before mounts.
---
&gt; Clipping tails off of zergs
---
That's what havoc teams do. Don't be tail, or at least don't solo run back, you're never the only one dead... Work as a squad.
---
&gt; Hyper specific instance of solo girl tactic.
---
Same before mounts, use that trick yourself, or build in escapes or counters (you have access to the same tricks, use them)
---
You can cast it while the tablet is traveling, but it's still a 1 second delay. Lunar Impact is similar yes, but it's not the Druid's only form of healing, where as Renegade Staff 4 and Ventari's healing are on delays and draw from the same pool of energy. On fights like Matthias this can cause a lot of issues when you have people running out to the edges of the arena to do mechanics. The travel speed of Tablet is pretty easy to adapt to, but having an additional delay makes it feel awful to use. A druid doesn't have to remove healing from the main stack to heal someone at a distance like Renegade does. You can't run Nourishing Roots, Spirit Boon, and Assassin's Presence at the same time due to them being in different trait lines.
---
Policy lmao.
---
Ben is responsible for 90% of the communication done on Anet's end and he probably does it because he cares, not because it's a new company policy. If anything they are more silent than ever.
---
the instant-finish skill should be removed, and replaced with the dismount skill.
---
tbh, the dismount trap and trick aren't needed. the warclaw needs a way to simultaneously dismount the user and the target (mounted dismount skill), and a way for unmounted players to dismount a mounted player (through breakbars or whatever).
---
A lot of mobs in Fractals have soft toughness aggro, meaning they overal prefer to target the one with most toughness but if they get interupted by any means or just randomll they will change target.
---
lol you're funny.
---
keep the wheelchair; you'll need it.
---
Ohhhh, that's actually a pretty good theory. Since they're now offering this "return to Guild Wars" thing, as we roll up the episodes, we'll end with the new one.
---
See you at the Top! 
---
Perhaps the slot for episode 5 will feature the remaining stories for requiem, as the episode is already free.
---
Just because it doesn't happen to you doesn't mean it isn't a problem for others.  
---
It can happen, and it's more common with new players, who are going to lose the interest in the game mode when they get ganked in their own territory constantly.
---
IMO, to make them worth the price, they should have some added flexibility. The helmet idea in this thread plus the ability to turn off shoulders would go a long way. I'd buy outfits with those extra features.
---
Let's be real here. That Deadeye's going to pop you whether you're on a mount or not, and if you get downed by a group of roamers 99% of the time you're dead anyway, and the instant finish just lets you respawn a few seconds sooner. At *worst*, dismount tricks return us to the state of the mode before the mount was introduced and ganks are equally prevalent. More likely, if there's some kind of resource attached to forced dismounts (existing traps have a pretty significant supply cost) it will limit gankers' ability to hinder players repeatedly and let them slip by in downtime.
---
Granted, that's *arguably* a downgrade from what we've got now. I like having a good chance to run past groups of enemy roamers without being murdered, and having that chance reduced isn't going to be fun, but it's not going to make running around any more unhealthy than it was a couple months ago.
---
shh don't tell him that, he won't be able to make his karma farming posts anymore

I will come back to WvW when there is a dismount skill. Until then I am not bothering.
---
Oceanblade, that has as it's blade a window into  an ocean-scene that "scrolls" with our movement. We don't really have a lot of water weapons.
---
This subreddit: Gw2 HaS tO RUn LIke sHIt dx12 iS nEvER coMINg
---
It still ahs the dodges. There shouldn't be an option to wander around WvW safely. It is pvp after all.
---
The magecrusher in Arah P3 has aggro based on healing power, cos why the fuck not
---
The design doesn't need to be topped, it just needs to be different.
---
All the 2nd gen legendaries we've gotten so far did a good job at offering a different option for style, there shouldn't be a #1 style choice for anything because then, everyone would just look alike (see female human meta).
---
Gives dumbledore using his wand a completely different meaning
---
I think we both misunderstood it as might for every condi on the target.
---
Many thanks
---
A-net still going strong with their increased communication &lt;3
---
The commander comes out as trans in the next episode.
---
Tbh all they need to do add some sort of locking mechanism to items. Item that player chooses to lock will be flagged as no salvage, no sale, no destroy. Right click, unlock them first to do such things. Afaik Lotro had a similar option, gw2 has the tech in invisible bags anyways
---
It doesn't even have to be unique and exciting to be a legendary, just look at the second legendary dagger (that looks almost identical to a hall of monuments skin) or the second longbow (that looks almost identical to the chaos longbow), just slap some footfalls on it and you're good to go. /s
---
The Magi one. The hybrid variant assumes that your group either doesnt need the full support of the magi build, your group has more than enough support to deal with the mechanics and you're just an insurance policy (typically helpful when training others due to the powerful one off rezzing and one burst heal Scourge has with the Blood Magic trait line) or that you or the group is comfortable enough with the current boss/content that you can take gear that improves your outgoing DPS while still bringing the utility of the build.
---
*Fun fact for all you Tybalt fans out there: because of his injured hand, he was never able to fully wipe himself.*
---
Skimmer turns into Swimmer.
---
Same here
---
Exactly. Everyone has a different workflow. Some of us prefer to stay on the standard bag train.
---
Renegade have other source of healing too. Its not because you didnt them or how how to use them well that they wasnt available.
---
Did you know that Staff AA heal? Those little healing orbs are actually really interesting if you know how to play with them.
---
Did you know tablet heal when it pass BY and in AOE on end location? That actually do a huge AOE in line form with 240 radius wide.
---
About Energy management, like I say before if you know how to manage it you will be fine. Managing Revenant energy became has hard has CA energy when you are use to it. I even use Elite Ventari when I still have to much energy and I wanna go into Kalla but still get the Charged Mist extra Energy.
---
I really hate whirling with sunrise/twilight/eternity because the entire sword flying out it such a departure from the original animation. Guardian 3 sends out whispy blue arcs and then it becomes the Oprah of legendaries.
---
The comeback so shit you had to do it twice?
---
Yeah, but then they can’t bash Anet for it.
---
I know what would top it easily. Imagine this:
---
It looks exactly like Eternity, except the Twilight skin shows in the day and the Sunrise skin shows at night. It would have better contrast.
---
We had two and a half one on the White Mantle (Matthias + Wing 3). So it wouldn’t be unprecedented.
---
Arenanet should give this guy a job!
---
I just hope it's not a joke legendary.
---
Yes probably &gt;90% of players at those metaevents are like you. they do not care about anything and get carryed by the remaining ppl. If you would play a decent build you do about as much as 5-10 other players combined. CC, DPS, Healing whatever, probably all at the same time. 
---
Some missions in early content can't be interrupted, but hardly any mission will take longer than an hour.
---
On newer content, there's more checkpoints and you can leave mid-missions safely. 
---
Is it possible to have someone use griffon and port to the end of the Draconis Mons JP? I don't have Oakheart mastery and it will take me forever to get :(
---
I'm waiting for it too! But I think they'll do it on a weekend if they do it, so far they've done all the big account upgrade sales on the weekends and fluff on weekdays. (Makes sense, the weekend is when most people play probably.) There's one weekend left so fingers crossed :)
---
By what right do you exclude the population!
---
Wait... would it be include in this case?
---
W4 is BAE
---
WHY can't Anet do this as standard? WHY? Pls for the love of God, put a few guys on this whose sole job is to update the engine and bring into today. I adore the game but so many maps with any sort of population, ie istan for example become a slide show for me :(
---
Well, one of them's referring to Rowling's pretty recent revelation of the relationship between Dumbledore and Grindelwald.  So it's a relatively fresh meme.  Rowling just can't seem to help herself when it comes to this stuff.
---
I'd like something different. It doesn't need to be "topped" by going even flashier.
---
Hopefully it's thematically different from the common legendary weapon themes we've already seen. I don't want yet another fire or frost-themed weapon, for instance. Though it'll be hard to differentiate from the [many greatsword skins](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gallery_of_greatswords) we already have.
---
I'd be curious to see what a legendary watchwork greatsword would look like, but even that idea would be similar to some of the current skins. Like most new skins, not everyone's going to be happy with what we get. I loved the new legendary longbow. Many didn't, but that's okay.
---
Not just a quaggan, an *orca whale* quaggan 
---
JetPack "Raptor" - propells you forward for a long leap, thrusters support running speed quite a lot
---
JetPack "Springer" - propells you upwards for a high leap, thrusters support running speed quite a bit
---
JetPack "Skimmer" - allows hover, can increase hover height for a short time
---
JetPack "Jackal" - makes use of Asura teleportation technology to zip you forward through time and space for a short, instant forward movement, thrusters support running speed quite a lot
---
JetPeck "Griffon" - optimized thruster size for high velocity flight or rather elegant falling, Griffon Wing flaps replaced by short thruster bursts, when grounded thrusters support running speed a little bit
---
JetPack "Beetle" - optimized thruster size for high velocity sprints, needs charge time for huge bursts of speed
---
JetPack "Warclaw" - thrusters support running speed a bit, uses lower powered, shorter ranged variant of the "Raptor" leap bursts, can use thruster bursts to help tear down a gate
---
I know there's already models like this, but I think it'd be really neat if they gave us a crystalline theme'd GS to tie into the theme of the Crystal Desert and Aurene/Glint.
---
That dagger has actually grown on me in time.  It has a pretty awesome draw effect and it isn't over the top like Sunrise, Twilight or Eternity.  I try to look at it as more of a ceremonial dagger; something the Charr fought over as a token of leadership because that's exactly what the claw of the khan-ur is meant to be -- a symbol of interconnected legions and Charr power. 
---
only if i get banned but i don't ....

Drawn - The character only holds a handle that spawns from the ethereal plain. And for attacks blades appears from thin air around you and slash the enemy.

it must have 4 different legendaries which  then forge into a giant rainbow blade shooting quaggans
---
Thank your for your sacrifice and data :-)
---
&gt; I will ID 2k rare unids next and will salvage the results with RCSOM and SFSOM but thought I put my findings about direct salvage out there first as it may take another couple of hours.
---
IMHO you can salvage all identified items directly with silverfed. It has already been established that silverfed is better than runecrafter for rare items.
---
deluxe/ultimate editions give you an additional slot, so getting deluxe for both HoT and PoF brings you up to 7 slots
---
I see this post with every outfit release. Just cease. Anet is aware of this concept and they will implement it or they will not.
---
F2P accounts have 2 slots. Any account with either HoT or PoF (or the Heroic edition) will have 5 slots to start with. The HoT Deluxe Edition comes with an extra slot and PoF Deluxe Edition comes with an extra slots.
---
So the extra slots do not come with the Standard Editions, only Deluxe. :(
---
Yeah the mount contests were why we ended up building ballistas XD Unfortunately that fight was like 30 minutes total and my recording setup only lets me capture the previous 2 minutes of action haha
---
use invisible bags.
---
Superior siege engine.
---
but that would look more like a staff ...
---
Isn't that because you are triggering a whirl finisher and creating projectiles?
---
The lay off shouldn't come much into effect until or after LS5 and most of the affected were of side projects outside of the game or unknown IPs
---
Your correct that it is complicated to implement using the methods you've described.  But there is a much simpler way that keeps everything as it is right now.  Whenever you salvage a piece of unidentified gear, automatically identify it (don't bother showing this to the user), then salvage the identified piece unless the identified piece randomly promoted to a higher tier.  I.e. if a green becomes a yellow or a yellow becomes an orange, don't salvage it, just leave it in the player's inventory.  This would remove a TON of the unnecessary inventory management, and completely avoid the problems your describing.  
---
Not exactly, while what you say it's technically correct, you **ALSO** get bonus Character slots when "**pre-ordering**" the expansions, even with the Standard edition, once they are released is just what you've said.
---
You'll never know when it happenes. It could be today, tomorrow, next year or never.
---
Having unlimited slots for free is better than having 2 slots for free.
---
Arc does even legendary stat, sigil and rune swap for you. How is that clunky?
---
I ran with a character called 'This clown' last week, this week I went meta with 'Funny Key Run Name'

Basically only and optional weapon on power reaper and even then you see more warhorn.

I thought she did hint about him being gay in the books but everything else was made up. For example, turning Hermione black.
