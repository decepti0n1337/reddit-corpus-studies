We have no way of knowing if they actually cancelled all other projects when the layoffs happened so they might still have something else around.

---
Y.I.K.E.S
---
In the past DLGamer had the pack at 47% off ($32), HoT has gone as low as 67% off ($11.41) on GamesPlanet and PoF has been 50% off on many sites. You can check sites like [isthereanydeal](https://isthereanydeal.com/search/?q=guild+wars+2#/) for more details. Never know when they'll do another major 50% off sale, maybe the August anniversary but we never know for sure.
---
No, I don't want that shit on my screen, and the world bosses really aren't worth the effort with the craptastic amounts of greens and blues and a single low tier mat..
---
Good to know! Ta :)
---
Eyes of Kormir are government surveillance drones.
---
World boss farming is some of the most fun I have in the game. They're spectacle fights. They're not mechanically challenging, but it's so enjoyable to see an entire community come together in one zone and take something down. World bosses and meta events in general are experiences that I don't really get in other MMOs and something I treasure in this game.
---
I might actually do dailies now! Thank you!!
---
Shatterer in Jahai?
---
What average fps did they have?  Yesterday I was in a map doing a boss beat down getting about 6fps.  My client crashed.  When I got back into the game I was in a near empty instance getting 60fps.
---
It was undoubtedly Guild MM
---
I honestly hope they tone down the CC scaling requirements in light of these events. I think I saw the break bar drop under 50% once so far.
---
It will be back many more times. :)
---
It just means they have something even more desirable in store for the next BL chest RNG fuckfest. ;)
---
I neither liked nor disliked your link. I'm indifferent because I don't care. I started with a small friendly indirect joke then you exploded and got so bitter and angry and petty and it was pretty funny. So thanks for that then.
---
Next BL chest update probably with War Eternal.
---
some armors look really oddly shaped on a male sylvari, usually requires a total makeover kit to make it look better. I enjoy it more than human though, especially the voice actor.
---
Respect.
---
I would love if a company like Riot would buy Anet out of their misery from NCsoft. Their playerbase is currently even awaiting an mmo from them and anet and riot share alot of similarity in development.
---
Can I move in with you?
---
I don't have a source to cite right now (in bed going to sleep, I can look in the morning if I remember it).
---

---
But I do remember reading several articles with them outright saying other projects (not necessarily all mind you) was cancelled.
---
No. You usually never use a dash in German if you merge words. That dash is also often called Deppenstrich (Idiots dash).
---
yes, yes you can
---
A night sky is not that color and the armor is magic too...
---
I think that's a poor place to have the Switch, one mouse flick to the right and... ;.;
---
But still awesome setup.
---
Piggy backing, I have an i5-4690k that runs great at 3.9ghz (automatic boost clock) with a 1060 6gb and 16gb 2400 MHz RAM. The processor was pretty cheap when I bought it.
---
It would be an outfit. The Do Not Hug Outfit.
---
Monitor edges arent seemelss along the top!

I'm a bit disappointed you're not using it to peek over walls in WvW
---
I waited around 6 years wanting to build it myself, and the time finally came where i was able to afford it.
---
That's essentially what I said.
---
If you want to be exact I guess they are **amulets** which contain **jewels** that can be forged into **infusions**.
---
So, long and short of it, Halloween infusions.
---
I'm returning after an extremely long absence and will be starting a new character. I'd like to do both PvP and PvE at endgame while feeling powerful while leveling. I just have no idea what class to choose besides being told "Mesmer master race," haha. Are there any guides for builds that are new player friendly? Does anyone have suggestions on a first character to bring to max level?
---
Actually i originally used it in wvw to be able to see zergs behind me, but im doing boss rush for the dailies then ill be doing wvw, gotta get that legendary armor! i went from rank 280 to 1080 in about 5 months, its grueling but works
---
I love Sylvari, but my character is female. I love how they glow at night (don‚Äôt forget to pick your glow color!)  and I think they‚Äôre really pretty. The cultural armor and Twilight Arbor dungeon armor looks the best on them, but they can also wear regular armor and look fine too. There are some pieces of armor that makes female Sylvari‚Äôs calves look massive and their feet really small.
---
I don't think that's realistic. I think what you're noticing is that we're reaching the end of a catastrophy storyline. It's the same sort of thing that happened with Doctor Who near the end of David Tennant's run. Where every season was dealing with a bigger bad threat. Kralkatorrik is, at this point, the most powerful being we've ever seen. So on the one hand, there's no way we can NOT stop him, otherwise the world is over. But if we DO stop him, there's a serious sense of "well what now?"
---
I don't see why releases would be slower.
---
I did the boss rush for a few hours last night and overall I was very disappointed with the rewards.  99% the loot I got was either semi-worthless vendor trash or semi-worthless crafting mats.  I think I got 1 piece of exotic equipment out of all of the loot boxes.  I didn‚Äôt make that much gold either selling the trash loot.  
---
I think the crux of the problems lie with the loot tables.  For the bonus loot boxes, I reckon the developers ‚Äúre-used an existing loot table‚Äù and added a couple of extra items to the loot table.  In general GW2 has big problems with its loot tables and the boss rush event essentially highlights these problems.  
---
Overall I think it would have been more rewarding to do the Fractals for the same period of time.  One of the reasons why I like fractals is that you get ascended equipment and agony infusions (which can be turned into stat infusions) on top of useful crafting mats and valuable vendor trash.  Heck, Fractals are more fun to do than the world bosses anyway and can be completed in a shorter amount of time.
---
I don't think the mists works like that at all
---
What's that device above the keyboard?
---
So the [Blacklion outfit ticket](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Outfit_Ticket) doesn't come around often. It was introduced at last year's birthday event (end of August) as a sort of "one time" item, but has actually come back in 2 different ways. One was within a [bundle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Evon_Gnashblade_Decorative_Package)  that was 3,000 gems, and currently available in [this bundle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/War_Eternal_Supply_Drop_Requisition) currently priced between 2.4k and 3k gems depending on when you buy it. (It was cheaper last week, and gets more expensive as time goes on. Cant get it for the 2.4k price now, but w/e). 
---
Those bundles are expensive, and whether they're worth it is relative to if you find the whole package useful. If you don't want to drop big gems for just an outfit, then I would wait out til the birthday and they miiiiight be back, we don't know for sure. Or just wait for the outfit you want to come back into rotation in the gemstore. 
---
The good thing about the outfit ticket when it is/was sold as a standalone item is the ticket was cheaper than the normal outfit cost, and if you bought the 10 pack then each outfit worked out to be super cheap.
---
I thought I was the only person that loved these sound effects. I'm not sure why... But they are very satisfying.
---
Edgy teen setup sure, no problem, do your thing. But that cable clutter is disgusting D: you should be ashamed of yourself!
---
I'll jump into an ascalon catacomb story run and talk people through how they arent a bad player just because they die easy and that I struggled just as much back in 2013.  End up always clearing with 4 new players after a couple build tweak suggestions and they all suddenly feel great about the game and a new interest in how deep their build can get.  It's a great time, I was their level once and someone helped me so great to pay it forward.
---
Charr.
---
gold wings
---
You are awesome. This community is based off of people like you. Just random fun with a bit of teaching.
---
Yes. No. Maybe. I don't know. Can you repost the question?
---
Rollin' Dis Ass sounds more fun..
---
Good thing you explicitly have to do 3 pve dailies for the 2 gold. That 2 gold is not that bad though for stuff you are already doing + things that take very very little time.
---
Hey, welcome back! I was in the same boat like 1-2 weeks ago! :)   
---
Getting back into this mmo was difficult since literally everyone I know stopped playing-- so hard to have a "direction" when you are in it alone, haha.   
---
For that reason, my big recommendation is to definitely get the expansion! (Maybe see if there'll be a discount when the new Living Story comes out later this month)  
---
The months and the fact that I had a new, exciting story to jump into really helped me get back into this game. Before I was just sitting trying to pick up from where I left off (farming bags from HoT/Silverwastes) but the story elements in Path of Fire helped rope me into the routine of this game and got me excited about character builds all over again. Even got season 3 on sale to fill in the blanks I missed during my absence! :)   
---
Alternatively, maybe finding a guild you really vibe with is another good route!
---
Maybe if he stacks his screens vertically he can peek over the wall, might be tall enough then lol üòÇ
---
I will be real, until you reach HoT lore is pretty crap so race doesnt matter, but in HoT Sylvari actually hears the moldremort voice in his head so thats kinna cool.... idk just go with the pretty one.
---
That wire mesh is giving me anxiety
---
I'm not talking about GW2, I'm a long time GW player, but about this thread as an imaginary parlour game.
---
My box of the Black Lion Trading Company is empty. I don't know any other trading things there.
---
You're not the boss of me now! You're not the boss of me now! You're not the boss of me now and you're not so big!
---
I think that would be an excellent name for it.
---
...Why? The upgrades are both largely useless. A glider and some minis? The Lily of the Elon pass so you can experience one of the premium hubs in glorious 2fps?
---
Are you mistaking this for something else? I can't see why someone would possibly be so into them as to convince friends.
---
Seconded. The training golem room is great for testing things that aren't just DPS benchmarks. Things like testing CC, healing output, and combat movement are all things to play around with in there.
---
Well I don't think so. We will get a new mount and iirc we didn't get a new mount skill alongside the rollerbeetle as well.
---
That one PvP spec that's been OP for almost 2 years.
---
All just to stand around in Lions Arch
---
Dang good point. It is the last episode of the season though, so maybe? (Probably not)
---
pretty much
---
In theory, it's supposed to be the next step every ten minutes
---
In practice, sometimes you end up in a rift that's part of the latter half of the previous step, instead of a rift moving onto the next step, which results in you doing the same rift twice.
---
Any kind of 3 kit condition engineer. Sure your dps ramps up through the roof but you'll get Carpel tunnel along with your legendary armor. Something like a 15 skill Rotation for max dps. Power holo in roaming is easier with a 10 skill rotation, just don't overheat. Getting downed, interrupted, or chilled can ruin it easily.
---
I got it a while ago i don‚Äôt quite remember what brand it is, but the top part is literally just a piece of wood sitting on the top layer. got the desk on amazon for college like 6 years ago.
---
oh sorry I meant rune of the soldier lol
---
its nice but way too small for the setup. i need a custom or larger one
---
I grabbed the branded. 
---
I was debating between branded, black feather, and crystalline dragon wings. I choose the branded set because I realized that it went better with more of my characters and it shows up on the gem store less.
---
Twice, over the last 6 years, I stalked 2 new players (on separate occassions) following them closely and silently. When they go down state, I come to their rescue and then slip back into the shadows... Must have rezzed like over 9 times... and they must have been thinking this game has a free rez mechanic. XD Fun times.
---
The ranger suggestion is definitely good, but I‚Äôd also recommend guardian. I‚Äôm not sure about PvP but I‚Äôve gotten my ass kicked by guardians there a few times and feel like it‚Äôs probably decently strong. It‚Äôs got a powerful core build as well as a lot of flexibility in play style with the elite specs and is great for PvE with a variety of meta options for endgame PvE content. I felt like it was probably the class I felt strongest on when leveling it too.
---
Depends on what you want you‚Äôre character to be like. 
---
Crystalline = over the top, shiny character that is going to be more fashionable than actually viable if irl 
---
Destroyer = demonic edgelord
---
This happened when my game wasnt fully downloaded but was playable
---
I decided to replay the story, and I'm trying to actually walk through the world and not fly through it. This shot reminded me of how I felt when I first saw Irithyll in Dark Souls 3. Gorgeous. Bravo, ANet. You create truly spectacular scenes.
---
Its a great ride, focus on world events, leveling will be more fun in my opinion anyway.
---
It's got nothing on [FFXV's food.](https://i.redd.it/v45pu19xj4w01.jpg)
---
You're in for a treat. This game had tons to do. Which profession/race you leaning towards?
---
Ranger/sylvari I think is how you spell it
---
If you ever get bored of all the bloom and fog they have, make sure to check out gw2 reshade.
---
Enter the fray in SW takes on a whole new meaning of creepy with the default settings.
---
We still haven't seen Bubbles.
---
why weird?,it doesnt do anything new,its using existing assets and its basicly grifon model with another wings. its completly useless mount which is obviusly added only to sell another skins. kinda like that cat from wvw,you can clearly tell from stream,when they ask him,WHAT IS PURPOSE OF THIS MOUNT? and he was like eeeeeeeeee ppl eeeeeeeeee will come to eeeeeeeeeee wvw and stuff..... look it up,it was quite funny.
---
Arenanet designed the lore so that all professions would fit every race well.
---
But in terms of the main plot, Arenanet does seem to favor sylvari a lot more than other races, giving them more unique dialogue.
---
That's what's up. I main the same combination. But I love every race and most classes
---
I most definitely will
---
Except it isn't useless and the warclaw turned out nice as well.
---
Now to learn how to taake images on the PC.
---
&gt;  I think ArenaNet has taken GW2 for granted.
---
I'm still not convinced that I'll buy the next expansion. I feel like I wasted my money on Path of Fire. I'm sorry, but after being cut off from the rest of civilization, Elonians won't suddenly start to use New Krytan. 
---
Where's the old script? I have yet to see it once.
---
Oof got em coach
---
Yeah you definitely have enough monitors to do it.
---
Cell phone pic of a screen.. In portrait even..   REEEEEEEE
---
I do not think there is a company wide ban on devs to browse the subreddit of their game lol. Ofc there is a chance it is seen by the devs. 
---
Also even if it wasnt, that doesnt mean it has no value. You ever had a bad experience in a shop somewhere? Ever talk about it with your friends outside the store itself? What was the point? the people who worked for the store didnt hear you?
---
To me I think this whole event thing is a great idea. It does not give us new or better old content, but it does show that anet seems more invested in the game and is more prone to shake things up a bit. We are at the first event now and they might expand or change the scope of what events are in the future. It's a start towards a more live game.  
---
I do admit I have not played for roughly a week now, generally just bored in the game, but it gives me hope to see anet more invested in the game that they have barely interacted with since launch aside from some new maps/episodes here and there. That being said, S1 was great and felt actively developing, and those current events are good for shaking the world up a bit, but that has been rare occurances.
---
Hey, just experienced a T4 run with you guys earlier today. I plan to come back multiple times during the week for them, so thank you and the rest of the EVA folks for doing this.
---
Yo PM me and we can play, finals are almost over for me so I will ne more free
---
How did you adjust brightness, contrast and colors of asus(es) to match those of lg?
---
[off topic] As you have noticed you‚Äôll get a certain sort of reaction here to phone pics of monitors.  Once you start getting to where you want to take pictures of the game, you can use F6 or PrntScr keys (default keybinds) and the client will take a snapshot and put it in your C:/User/Documents/Guild Wars 2 folder for you (and generally better quality photo as it doesn‚Äôt have issues of lighting/screen glare/etc.)
---
And if you ever forget info (such as those keybinds) just remember that the GW2 wiki is your friend and an invaluable resource.
---
Huh ... that is weird. Did you already download part of it previously? The count of files remaining is missing around 300-400 thousand.
---
Yeah it's been a good day or two download, barracks wifi is a terrible thing but it seems to be speeding up
---
PCs/laptops have keys to take a screenshot or a screenshot function.
---
Welcome to the community. I hope you end up enjoying the game!
---
Tyvm
---
Ahhh. Best of luck
---
Windows has a tool called \`snipping tool\` for partial screen caps like the one you posted.
---
Oh just ignore them.  They're a mesmer.

Welcome to Tyria!

You mispelled human female
---
It‚Äôs not 100% but i prefer a slightly darker tint with a little less gamma on my displays so they look virtually the same with custom settings, i just find it being like 15% darker easier on the eyes for longer periods.
---
You were close, but you misspelled Norn Female
---
I like multitasking so multiple= good, but i think 3 is good enough for now, the ones i got are higher quality so semi expensive, i actually replaced the one on the right because it has a ton of bad pixels , the new one has one dead pixel but its near impossible to see.
---
Yeah, it seem a bit bugged. Last i do this, we ended up on the map we started and enter the rift.
---
You misspelled Quaggan.
---
It's not actually really a flying mount, more a gliding mount. On its own, it doesn't really have a lot of ability to gain elevation easily, and as it flies it always slowly descends
---
When I read that Caithe said it had been days, my heart sank. The first thing I pictured in my mind was Snargle‚Äôs reaction from your last comic and... T-T
---
Just finished legit levelling up one of my characters without an instant Level 80 boost. Trust me, going around and getting events and story quests done, along with using Laurels to purchase boosters makes the whole experience much more manageable. You'll have a great time. :)
---
Shortcut for it is Windows-shift-s

---
How many eyes do you have?? Nice setup!
---
Newish player here. What gear should I be wearing as a fresh level 80 Mirage? I heard people say just buy cheap gear from the marketplace but which ones?
---
you misspelled Joko
---
They never said there are even plans for next expansion :) currently, season 5 is the last piece of content officially announced
---
Every feature they announced that day was said as not guaranteed to be released, build templates included
---
Fair enough, but have more faith in ArenaNet! They're not going to close out the story so soon if they've still plans! Unless they move into side stories and intrusive subplots like with Gw1
---
There' are also the hallucination-making mushrooms from a few episodes ago for an unhealthy dose of escaping realitty. We have researchers, fighters, a private eye and with Kasmeerr someting clergy? But no psychologist....
---
Welcome!
---
Shatterer crystals
---
[removed]
---
Congrats! I hope more new players would do the same thing, using level 80 booster right away is never a good idea.
---
Isn't it Killier Kale? Asking for a friend:)
---
Depends a little on what you want to do and what kind of build you want to run. You can go power or condi. Check the Trading Post for [Named Armor sets](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Named_armor), they're often quite cheap.
---
You misspelled PRAISE JOKO
---
Does anyone remember this line from Faolain from season two? I do. It's my favourite line of dailogue in the entire game, one that I think is delivered more perfectly than any other, even in the most contemporary story:
---
["And the pain that comes with failing to live up to her expectations. Why can't she love us unconditionally? She claims to believe that all weeds and blossoms are equal. Yet, she tries to make us all into blossoms."](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Meeting_the_Asura#Caithe.27s_memory)
---
Why are they trying to make the Pale Tree into this perfect mother who wants nothing but the best for her children, a mother that always know's best, one that destroyed Cadyern, the reason the nightmare court exists. Why try to oversimplify something that you have set up in the past to be such a beautiful, tragic, twisted melancholy of a story for the sole purpose of a character who is no longer relevant (the Pale Tree) look better? Why bother with the entirety of season 2 at all and the interactions with the Pale Tree when she is shown to have the capability of cruelty for the sake of the 'greater good' at all. The Pale Tree, Nightmare Court and sylvari as a whole are so enticing as a race in my opinion because of this complex relationship all sylvari must have with their pale mother. Not only this, I always thought that the resentment Caithe held towards the Pale Tree was an awesome part of her character, and that her bond with Aurene would finally be an opportunity for her to heal and let go of the tightly would vines her reputation in the eyes of the Tree has held on her for Caithe's entire existence. Faolain as well, such a complex and intricate character, being reduced to nothing more than and abusive manipulator for the sake of... what? Caithe doesn't have to be perfect to be Aurene's protector, and making her out to just be a victim with Faolain the perpetrator is such a gross shallowing of their characters I don't even know what to say. I'm really upset they've just brushed all this incredible dark history away with "yeah it was ur classic abusive manipulative relationship lels" for no reason it seems then to make Caithe more palatable to people.
---
grotesque? they're sylvari, they don't need to look human. props to the artist for highlighting their inhuman features and plant-based nature i say
---
don't worry it's just plebbit getting mad because they can't comprehend making sylvari look like the inhuman, plant-based dragon minions they are and deserve to be depicted as
---
maybe open the page
---
what were you playing before?
---
It's a nice  setup for games that take advantage of such a large field of view (such as racing games and sim games in general). Completely pointless for a MMO however.
---
TL:DR: weird flex but ok.
---
what pc spec do you have 0.0 are you able to play with everything turned to max/ultra?
---

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.

Yes i stalked this low level player around for a hour, i was like bat man, every time he went for a hero point challenge, i swoop in on my raptor, help him kill the npc, and mount up and leaps away and continue to stalk him :D
---
Please for your sake and mine fix the UI. There is a hidden flag you can add to the shortcut launcher to move the elements to stretch and fit on all 3 screens to make it feel more immersive and pretty. I believe it's "-uispanallmonitors". Just add that after the target.

You'll thank me later

i would suggest checking. the computer time clock to make sure it is correct and not out of sync

I think f2p players can't use map chat

I do not share your interpretation about Zojja, but the rest is pretty correct. It's good to see Caithe being enriched again and again among releases. As was Trahearne in Knight of the Thorn.
---
It's been a while since I checked but wasn't rabid better than rampager's as a budget condi set?
---
Thanks!
---
Leveling another toon feels counterintuitive but it's great advice. I think I'll level a Ranger.
---
Launch buddy saves lives
---
I once did a Sorrow's Embrace explorable path and LFG'd it as "everyone welcome". Took a while but eventually it filled ... with two people under the recommended level. Now that's not great, but I said fuck it, we're doing this. I pointed out that this dungeon was usually for players 3-5 levels above them, and it turned out one of those two (or maybe both, can't remember) was a new player, which would double your chances at things not going well. 
---
I still was patient and friendly with them, explained what to watch out for (stoopid mines), and in the end our group had a lot of fun and I received a letter from the mentioned new player thanking me profoundly for being so nice to them. Funnily enough, quite a while later I was nonsense-chatting around in Bitterfrost Frontier map chat with some people, and suddenly I get a whisper from someone saying that they remember me from that one dungeon they did back when they were new, and thanked me again because thanks to me, they stuck with the game. Warm fuzzy feelings were guaranteed.
---
I was expecting there would be heroes in GW2 like there were in GW1 (similar to SWTOR's companions). Mesmer plays very very differently. Which is good.
---
I'll definitely start another character. Feels like it's the best option.
---
It's a game.... if you follow them they'll just be like "huh this guy is weird he's been following me for a while now. i wonder what he's up to" 
---
some people even might find it hillarious and are thankful for the help especially early on. 
---
This is different from street stalking they can just log off or use a waypoint if they feel uncomfortable and they are never in actual danger.
---
where can i find it?
---
Define ‚Äúnew‚Äù

Well... We all knew it was gonna happen this sooner or later. :P

(I laughed for 10min straight after I saw this. Recomend to be alone at home, otherwise mere bystanders might not understand.)
---
Yeah this has been an issue since LWS3 E1... i think I've actually crashed a map instance with it once (or at least DDoSed my port on the server. Was not able to relog for a few seconds.)

---
Wow, thank you, but i just bought PoF because i didnt believe there will be soon any sale and after that i heard that there will be maybe sale when new episode comes. However, and with full price game worth it. Thank you, again!
---
So as you are a former wow player: get the first mount with your lvl 80 character. These are account wide. Now you can level a character to 80 with a mount which is way better!
---
Good bot

We had a helmet in Ffxi called Ace's helm, and the auto translate function turned it into Ass Helm when going from EN to DE. Was great

Is a weapon.
---
Well good news is it's worth full price and you'll get to play it right away instead of waiting potentially months!
---
I don't know... it's like I thought about Zojja instantly. :D

Yup, store can be very slow at times. Some people temporarily get an improvement from [clearing the cache](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/231273908-Troubleshooting-Trading-Post-Errors) but I'm not aware of any permanent solution and seems to have gotten worse. I think anet would need to fix things on their end for there to be a long term solution.
---
I hope you used a tree tonic if they ever turned around while you were following them
---
If you have the first episode of Season 3 (Out of the Shadows) you can train a mastery that gives you a special action to negate those tethers. If you don't have that, cleansing the conditions the tether applies to you can help.

---
And here's [my preset with](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8kf6ji/please_share_your_best_gw2hook_presets/dz87okz/) installation instructions.
---
For most classes, yes. Mesmer/Mirage is the exception to the rule due to how illusion scaling works.
---
I'll look into how to get a mount.
---
You can also use the zephyr sanctum model to trigger a cutscene which will get rid of it.
---
This has been an issue already before hot (before max level boosts) 
---
Forcing people to make full content first doesn't change that
---
The technical term is vegetarian vegetable
---
Ahh, I see. Thanks!
---
Yeah, I remember there was an extra action with a 'locked' symbol on my screen. Guess it's time to try finish HOT and start Season 3 instead of getting sidetracked by absolutely everything lol.
---
Cool, ty.
---
I hope Zojja does come back for the final battle with Kralkatorrik maybe have Eir and Snaff come out of the mists again so we can have Destiny's Edge back together for the final battle. Afterwards they can write Zojja out of the story completely to be honest Kralky dying could be a good way to retire all of Destiny's Edge their story began with Kralky and it can end with Kralky.
---
They honestly come out to 1-2% DPS in the end. Sure some make better use of slightly more power or condition damage (or concentration/expertise capping) but really unless you're trying to hit perfect benchmark numbers they aren't going to matter.
---
open bags than relog
---
That depends on what you mean by "best". It may not be the quickest way,
---
But if a few ppl see it... some rumors and it will create LEGENDS!
---
off topic but gauntlets are dyeable when back piece is not... unfairness on Tyria xD
---
Does it work with the dx12 add-on?
---
Thank you for writing this all up!
---
They've put it here for the photo. I'm not sure people are that careless to put it right on mouse pad.
---
Drag your mates in if you can! Sharing the new mmo journey with others can be quite special.
---
Dude is good asf I wanna download
---
I agree 100%. While the renown hearts are often dull and repetitive, they are fairly easy to do. In my opinion, moving from easy to more progressively challenging areas is the absolute best way to learn your profession's mechanics, soak in the lore of the game, and achieve world completion all at the same time.
---
I've seen on this forum countless people posting that, after x years or x thousand hours of play time, they've *finally* gotten World Completion. Hell, ALL of my characters have gotten that, and it didn't take that long to get them either. Not to boast, because I am probably in the bottom quarter of the population as far as wealth goes, but I do have a dozen or so gifts of exploration lying around in my bank, waiting for the day I want to start a new legendary.
---
One other sweet benefit of world completion is that you unlock all the waypoints to anywhere in the world you want to go!
---
As someone who used to troll with mesmer portals I agree
---
Dropping people off in lava would be great
---
They knew the risks exists before taking a sit so no problem with that.
---
Whenever I finish a new gear setup for a build on a class I‚Äôm not used to playing, I go into T1 fractals, open a LFG specifically for beginners and explain all mechanics in detail of that Fractal while being able to test out my new class/build. It‚Äôs a win win
---
Yeah okay, I might have jumped to conclusions as others are talking about vertical progression here.
---
IMO we already have had examples long term progression on some form, such as raid collections, legendary collections, fractal god progression, full armor set from stories etc. Its just that the releases are rather sporadic to keep people focused. 
---
Anet also needs to focus on giving more rewards on fractals, as it is the blending pot of casual and hardcore players and probably the most accessed organized PvE content in the game. Its about time we had fractal armor sets for example, or gold Ad Infinitum, or another tier of fractal weapons. Fractal god isn't exactly the same.
---
I would appreciate if you respond sooner than 10 days.
---
Everyone claims this, but never gives the math to back it up.
---
Show me the math that proves this true. 
---
I do not think for a burst class that it will be as low as 1-2%, with all the multipliers that get stacked.
---
One of us! One of us! ONE OF US! ONE OF US!
---
Who cares what the whales Think. They Can just start respecting the Value of money like adults.
---
These are all amazing names‚Ä¶ Why can't I think of stuff like this when I make characters x.x
---
I've been playing for 2 months now. PvE is super fun, PvP is pretty toxic. It's a great free to play game.
---
Use search bar?
---
Which mmos did you play before? And are you on NA or EU?
---
When you have the griffon, find high ground in some of the old maps and see the world from a new perspective. It's an awesome way to appreciate the scale of some of the locations in the game.
---
This MMO is a gem. Enjoy it. This month, we will finally be able to do a barrel roll on a frickin‚Äô dragon.
---
#another way to carry to map completion, just press F every now and then for a vista or hp...
---
Oh, also welcome to one of the best PvE communities out there. (PvP and WvW can be pretty toxic, but if you don't mind or play with mates, those are fun too). See you in Tyria
---
To be fair, combo fields are whatever in pve unless you do hardcore shit.
---
I wonder what its hitbox gonna be, so say if you can just afk hover anywhere and not get hit (at least in core tyria).
---
And for males, there's oversized shoulderpads. Some look cool, others look absurd.
---
I'd love to see that too, that could be an amazing innovation for rp players. However, I can't deny the fact that it will quickly turn into a map completion selling trend.
---
ah shit, here we go again
---
This looks awesome!
---
I got a normal ascended backpack. If I slap a +9 infusion on it and infuse the backpack **later** will the +9 agony infusion be gone?
---
Agree. I would like to see Anet putting a restraint on a level 80 booster, making it usable only if you have had at least one character at level 80 already.
---
New player experience sucks, imo you did the right thing skipping that. Watch some YouTube for what there is at endgame/how to gear ur character.
---
I see no problem in that. GW1 had a lot of "travel" services and players designed builds just for that, which was great.
---
Don't worry, you wont be able to fly everywhere. You'll hit the ground sooner than you think and have to mount up on a land mount. Griffon basically just glides super fast. It doesn't make you ignore the scenery, but rather see it from another, often more beautiful angle.
---
It also really annoying if someone keeps interfering in fights and killing everything before you.
---
Same! I love it, played on release and had a break for 5 years and now I've returned. I need this theme!
---
[ModelMod](https://github.com/jmquigs/ModelMod) (probably at least)
---
Same. We had a whole squad of protecc squad golems. The constant porting made it difficult to keep up.
---
From time to time I do help them around. Give them a few gold and bags for a head start.
---
Being nice is nice.
---
May 28th, 2020.
---
Chat and mini-map on the button? bleh
---
I think you can't get the reward from boss outside your map instance. You have to be there.
---
With how frequent one gets on and off their mount when playing, having a passenger seat would be kinda useless... Its better if just each person has their own mount.   
---
Otherwise that's just another level of annoyance.
---
&gt;I expected it'd be like WoW where you start at the lowest level of the new zones
---
I don't know if you noticed but you are playing a different game.
---
Thanks
---
Needs more monitors until you're surrounded by them so you can look behind you for backstabbing thieves.
---
Your chrono or renegade should do it
---
Aw shit, here we go again.
---
As far as I know even healing counts to the event participation so its not all about dmg
---
Srsly this. You get no feel for the class, you don't know what skills are good, or even what they do (let's be honest even if you read the skills in the beginning you have no idea what that means).
---
If you want to help just send them 18 or 20 slot bags. Or buff swiftness at the spawn.
---
Wow thanks dude!!!
---
Any pvp game is gonna have toxic people...
---
Welcome!!! I highly recommend you focus on the renown hearts early on actually. They really help with the world building and setting the tone. Take your time with levelling i.e. don't set it as your main goal. Learn your class well in case you ever want to foray into PvP. I cannot tell you how many people post in here saying they rushed to level 80 and now have no clue what to do. The world events are all very fun as well and I do recommend you make your way over to them if they pop up while you are running about. Also, gather materials!!! Lol my biggest regret is walking oast so many nodes while playing and finally deciding to make my legendary and being strapped for materials! If you ever need a guide or a helping hand just message me here or in game and i will be more than happy to help!!!!
---
I think a few hits and you're good. As long as you're in the same instance and hit the boss before it dies.
---
An odd thing happened the other day though, while I was taking part in a WB train, where I got the reward for killing the WB, but didn't get the bonus box chest. I carried on with the train and the WB's after that dropped the boxes just fine, it was just that 1 time.
---
What kind of degenerate are you?
---
What‚Äôs a f2p player? I thought the whole game was free to play now? I can use map chat, I don‚Äôt have any restrictions. Is that because I pre ordered the game?
---
wtf...
---
I have the birdy and still rollerbeetle most places.
---
I thought it was cannabis
---
I already have 14 char, mostly 80, but I'm only playing one char (about 3k hours, for 3k5 on my account).
---
he stops at 25% no matter what
---
You can do either that or just take an achievement which shows you a map position (like one of the krait chest ones). You know, where your map opens and your camera scrolls to a certain location. 
---
You just need to click on this button, wait until your map opens, close your map and that's it. It's the same effect, but you don't have to port and also have no loading screen.
---
Praise Joko
---
the dredge is really not easier
---
all the ice elemental attacks are a lot better telegraphed: the agony is slower and happens only in a small area in front of the boss(slightly behind but barely) which means it can be avoided by simply walking; the multiple aoe indicators don't vanish and you have a pseudo-timer as the icicles slowly drop to the ground
---
meanwhile the dredge "autoattack" is almost instant and hits pretty hard, the agony requires a properly timed double dodge, the bombs "disappear" and dodging them is harder
---
so the only issue you could run into are the adds..so uh..bring some reflects instead of this meme workaround? or cleave them down i guess
---
Or just use an achievement that show you a location on the map (the krait chests for example), so you don't have to have an item in your inventory.
---
I wish I had that sense of wonder like when i started GW2 still fun tho
---
But DDoS means it's from several clients. O_O
---
I have 4690K overclocked to 4.6GHz, you will get much better FPS than you have atm. That is if you will only play GW2, if you have a 2nd screen and you will for instance watch youtube while playing or multitask in general it is likely you will experience stutters.
---
GW2 uses all 4 threads of my CPU and utilizes around 80-100% of it. So if you want to multitask you will need sth with more threads as well. Plus you will pay quite a bit to buy one at the moment fo what it is.
---
PC spec:
---
* 4690K
---
* 16GB RAM
---
* 1070ti
---
* GW2 running on SSD
---
I have it set the exact same way lol like I completely relate
---
Internet point farming is important.
---
Hey, welcome!
---
If you want my advice?  Take your time, okay?  GW2 is a game played at your own pace; there's lots of nooks and crannies to explore, and if you rush to the end you'll miss out on a lot of content.
---
(Also good job making the correct choice for your race ;) )
---
Humans are the ones with the most fleshed out background (considering GW1 was all about humans) and they are quite atypical for a fantasy world. Humans play the role that (high) elves play in most games: most magical of all the races, put on the world by gods from another dimension ect. Sylvari on the other hand are 100% new to the world (charr, norn and asura also have GW1 backgrounds) but they got substantially fleshed out in HoT. As it stands, sylvari are the most interesting interesting race lore-wise. Lore-technically ranger is most suited to sylvari and norn, athough the prof goes reasonably well with all races.
---
Can someone tell me how to have the ui only in the middle screen but not the sides? I did this for awhile at max graphics but my old cpu couldn't keep up xD

Oh hun, the image of me being bitter and angry is all in your own head. Prob your own low self esteem causing it. I've been amused at your attempts to have the last word in this convo for ages XD.

Like 90% sure this is the upgrades in the gemstore if you already have standard editions, not a new deluxe expansion key. They're discounting the upgrade from 2k (typical) to 1k gems (sale price) irrc.

I did stand fo half of the night once in Queensdale and explaining basic stuff to the new players (before post-tutorial spawn was moved next to the bridge), demoing professions, weapons and skills

It's cheaper to not infuse the backpack and to get to 150AR with one less slot
---
don't see it happen
---
No
---
You only get loot once per day per character, Maybe it's that. You will get the bonus chest from the world boss event thing, but not normal loot, that is limited.
---
The thing is being level 80 *isn't* a big deal.  It's the starting line.  
---
The learning curve is proper dodging habits that produce the "evaded," text and damage mitigation awareness of skills such as blinds, blocks, evades, stun-breaks, reflects, projectile-blocks, invulnerability skills, interrupts, boons and debuffs (conditions).  
---
Being able to comfortably and confidently play your character and adapt it to various situations is the finish line.  
---
Being level 80 or having a set of exotics is meaningless if you don't know how to properly play your character.   The vast majority of OHKO attacks are going to one-shot you in all but the tankiest sets of gear.  It's important that you learn how to instinctively dodge so that you can react quickly enough to survive the [dodge or die] learning curve.
---
You can improve your gear from exotic to ascended.  You can unlock and learn how to use new elite specializations in various contexts; PvP, PvE, Fractals/Raids, WvW.  However, usage varies and properly understanding all the tools at your disposal is a big part of becoming a successful and independent GW2 player.
---
Take your time.  There'll be plenty of time to do end-game activities later on when you're better adjusted.

The World Bosses got a lot of love with this event.

The bonus loot chances though didn't convince me to keep grinding.
---
Fortunately there is still quite a big number of people who grind it and this will inevitably drive the prices on those luxury items down.
---
That's not the game or its expansions. That's a shitty mini, a shitty banner thing, probably some other shitty skins. Comes with a character slot. If you don't have a lounge pass, the PoF one may have some use but the HoT one is HoT garbage.

---
this this this!! i've been playing since 2012 with way too many hours logged, and i can not recommend this enough
---
I see why it might be an issue since new players might have a problem with obtaining low level runes and sigils. But on the other hand, hardly anybody bothers and there are cheaper ways to level crafintg, aka discoveries

Okay, so you need to pull out a thesaurus and take all synonyms for killer/death/whatever else you can think of for one list. The other? Single word plant names. \*nodnod\*

Consider trying the d912pxy mod to increase performance. For me it gave huge boosts, but it really depends on specific hardware. But hey, at least it's free performance.
---
I did this and came back from my break to find a dwarf on a griffon dropping from just above me to hit me, then flying up to do it again, slowly -- very slowly -- chipping away at my health. I really have to admire his tenacity (even if it didn't work).
---
I remember the idea being ruled out because of how the mounts were essentially tied to your character but after watching the most recent live stream about the mount I'm a little hopeful. They mentioned how the new skyscale mount works differently from the older models and we even dismount while it remains temporarily active. Then again i'm also looking forward to player housing.

I am trying to get the final ascended weapons for my healing druid, and I have enough to buy from the Pvp vendor. However, I don't see any axes in the weapons chest with harrier stats (Zehtuka). Am I missing something? The wiki says that I could buy weapons with any stats, but I do not see any weapons with Harrier stats.
---
It does matter. When the game sorts you into a shard, it absolutely does take your server into account and tries to put you with others from your server. If you want to end up in the right RP shard, joining TC for NA or Piken for EU will help.
---
Yes. It's more commonly known as "Order of Whispers".
---
No it's useful for cliffs that are hard, annoying or impossible to get up using the springer. This should be obvious, but i guess you're an idiot.

By what they said recently, the whole charms/symbols/motes mats is a step towards the introduction of legendary runes and sigils, so I am not confident ArenaNet would significantly change their pricing and thus availability unless it goes in the same direction they intend with the legendary items. And I would hazard a guess that they probably want them more expensive to avoid requiring people to get 10 stacks of each charm for a legendary.
---
On the other hand, these charms and symbols will get even more expensive when those legendary runes/sigils appear... So who knows.
---
They have Coleman brand in that game?  Wow.
---
I always wanted the WvW mount to be a dolyak or other pack animal like a bull or a marmox that can carry +2 players and another +2 after unlocking related WvW abilities.
---
It would have been slower than other mounts but still faster than swiftness alone, and faster in one's controlle territories after training the corresponding WvW ability. It would suck hairy grawl balls at jumping, with a jump shorter than players, barely higher than rollerbettle.
---
The mount would have a single bar of endurance like the skimmer, to 'rush' faster ahead, which gives speed but makes it harder to turn, and it would not evade attacks during the whole rush, only for the first 0.75s of it, and only after training the corresponding WvW ability. 
---
The mount would have a defiance bar while rushing, and breaking this defiance bar will dismount everyone riding it. 
---
The engage skill would be "Goring charge". The mount would rush ahead, trampling enemies on its way, and pushing them to the sides, and finish with a head attack that launches enemies in place (0 distance launch).   
---
The owner of the mount would get also 4 skills in slots 2, 3, 4 and 5, one for each additional seat:
---
* When no player is in a slot, it becomes a toggle skill you can use to switch a seat 'open for public seating' to determine whether anyone can seat on it. Party members can still seat even when a slot is off, but squad members would have to be in the same subgroup to seat on your mount when a seat is closed. 
---
* When a player in is a slot, you can use it to kick off the mount a player sitting in that slot.
---
Players riding with you would be able to use 2 skills if they also have the WvW ability: one to 'cheer' for the mount and give it endurance recovery (like Bond of Vigor but just 1s instead 5) so it can rush more often, and another to throw stuff at incoming enemies to daze them for 2s.
---
Additionally, the mount could have an additional final WvW ability that would cost a whopping 500 WvW ability points, and allow your mount to carry supply.  
---
The mount would be able to accumulate up to 100 supply by standing near the supply depot and waiting. Only one mount would be able to gather supply at a time, and the camp will give priority to the one one with the least supply. Since this would take a while, smart commanders would send supply teams ahead of themselves to gather the supply in preparation for the next attack.  
---
While carrying supply the speed of the mount would be reduced to that of a player, and to that of a player with swiftness while rushing. Players would get supply by approaching the mount and using a special action skill that would appear.  
---
Dismounting or being dismounted by enemies would dismiss all the supply (maybe drop part of it on the ground as temporary pickups that disappear in a few seconds), so the players riding mounts carrying supply would have to be defended.
---
why not just salvage more frequently before you get to 1500?

That's interesting. You could try a reinstall. Cuz if your ram goes on 100% only on guildwars then it's not your ram I presume
---
Oglaf for the GW2 community.
---
RIP RAM
---
So in windowed mode game consumes over 10gb ram?
---
I don't think I've been here, which map is this?
---
i have a 7700k and my performance suffers. i never knew that was why. so its normal then?
---
Slaughter Salad
---
&gt; There's no need for complicating the core Tyria maps.
---
To the contrary, I believe in bringing core Tyria up to standard, so that there is a more accurate depiction of the game once they play expansions.
---
In task manager under the memory tab it has 95% and shows GW2 running 3gb of memory, ive not got this problem with other games i run like eso and VR?
---
it will be really slow in open world. Ive done it.. its not great. remember you can always just have a second set of dps gear with you for when you arent with other people.
---
If you waypoint to another map while mounted, based on what we know of the game, for the other players it'd be the same as if the player with the mount disconnected. 
---
The player and the mount would disappear, and the passengers would lose the mounted transformation and fall to the ground.
---
So such a mount would only be usable within a map to carry passengers. You'd have to carry them to the zoning portals between maps, and mount again on the other side after loading the map.
---
considering [this](https://www.deviantart.com/kinixuki/art/To-the-desert-698996387) is how they draw sylvari i'm pretty sure it is
---
Gearing in this game is easy for open world. So you can get your support gear for fractals / dungeon and simply keep a damage set around for open world. Resetting traits is possible everywhere and whenever you want (outside of combat).
---
You won't have that much fun open world with a pure support build. While max kill time is nowhere as long as it is in WoW for example, it still takes considerably longer. Generally speaking offense is the best defense in open world.
---
Thanks for this post. I haven't had a chance to read requiem and I probably won't get it either  so a nice sum up like this was very helpful.
---
Aaaaaaand it's gone!
---
(stuck in loading for me, at least)
---
There's a bridge event in one of the core maps where you defend it while it's repaired. I was testing the griffon out and saw two players defending it. I landed behind them and as a deadeye began supporting them with rifle shots.   
---
I didn't decimate the enemy, I only shot when it looked like they might be overwhelmed. I think they were new, either way they did really well, and thanked me when we were done. I mounted up again and they were like:   
---
'You can fly!?'  
---
I replied with a witty:
---
'The world still needs bridges, even if you can fly,' before I took off.  
---
In retrospect my reply is far more profound than I intended it to be.
---
That's what I thought, we would have to carry them to portals between the maps. It kinda negates the use if the new players have Raptors, but would be cool anyway.
---
I wish I hadn't used my free "skip to max level" token right away, but I wanted to skip straight to end game content at the time. 
---
I have since gone and done a bunch of the early and mid game stuff that I skipped, and wish I had done that first.

It is the tiger cub's den in the Secret Garden, The place where you need to nurture the tiger cubs during the Chuka and Champawat legendary collections.

shouldnt you go and read those 99+ emails in your windows mail first ? :)

JK, welcome on board, Commander!

I just hear Ragnaros screaming every word.
---
It has been a while since I played an MMO so it feels like it is time to try a new one. Don‚Äôt know anything about GW2 other than hearing positive things about it from time to time.
---
I guess my biggest worry is that I would be hopelessly behind at this point. Is it possible to start now, from scratch, and still be able to do well in endgame, both in PvE and PvP? And this within a reasonable amount of time?
---
For example, if I would start playing WoW now it would not be too hard, if I start Neverwinter now I would be utterly fucked.
---
I'd call it a slider XD. It's true that it's really good.

can you my dear son,explain me,where in gw 2 you need to climb hard,annoing or impossible rocks,WHERE ARE MOUNTS ALOWED YOU DUMB FUCK? geeeeeeez,go back to queensdale stalk lvl 5 players. mentaly chalenged grifon race was that uphill chase of ley enery with speed of snail. geez you are dumb as fuck.
---
You could possibly piggyback on another larger guild and ask to run that as an event with them. You or your BF would lead the event, or could help to do so. 
---
As far as the desire for it, there are gathering guides on [https://gw2efficiency.com/](https://gw2efficiency.com/) but I do know that some people like to get lead around
---
Sorry I only follow level 7s and 9s.
---
I mean, core Tyria *did* have currencies... dungeon currencies. I think it would be great if there was a way to earn them outside dungeons.
---
Are you worried about gear/account progression or are you worried about personal skill? There's not that much loot treadmill so it's not that bad to get to end game. Getting actually good at the game is entirely up to you.
---
So your problem is fixed?
---
I wouldn't worry about the Griffon killing your love for it. The lack of permanent flight and the continuous need to dip down to the floor adds another level of play that otherwise doesn't exist. 
---
The griffon is nothing like flying mounts in WoW. The skyscale on the other hand..
---
"Deadeyes have to go, too"
---
No, unfortunately one of you will have to start over.  There is no cross-server interaction.  Whomever chooses to start over will have to get a game licence code for the region (US or EU) that your friend is on.
---
Thanks you. This is helpful.
---
So I can‚Äôt obtain zehtuka‚Äôs weapons from the vendors that give ascended chests? I have to transform them using Mystic Forge?
---
It‚Äôs actually pretty fantastic for WvW, you basically get peripheral vision of the battlefield and can see enemy squads movements more easily. 
---
I moved from a triple monitor set up to a single monitor because game support for it was getting pretty shitty but gw2 is the game I miss most in surround.

Use them on a lvl80! They still give you some useful stuff minus the experience :3
---
Good idea! The more ppl gather mats, the cheaper mats get for us lazy TP ppl.
---
Welcome, comrade
---
I love how you placed your stream deck.
---
That‚Äôs a terrible idea. You want the UI to be kept in view so you can keep track of things, The side monitors are meant to add peripheral vision while you keep focus on the centre display.
---
I agree on the idea of using lvl80 booster does not make you miss anything. BUT,  it does make newer players feel they are left behind and I have encountered lots of new players gave up after using the lvl80 booster because they were confused about what they should do. So I think leveling the first ever character to level 80 is always a must, 'cause it gives newbie a basic ground of how the world of Tyria works and builds up their bond with the game itself.
---
Good news indeed, I am more worried about the gear progression than anything else. Thanks!
---
Ember Bay lets you dump skritt in lava and hear them scream.
---
I love all the new content!! :))
---
No please.
---
They need to adress the lack of rewards first before even jumoing into adding currencies. We have 3 maps in a row now that have nothing interesting to spend currencies on.
---
Auric Basin.
---
The Music is just üëå
---
I wouldn't mind it, but they'd really need to have a benefit to doing so vs leaving karma as the currency.  That means they'd need to improve the rewards available within the regions. They won't make the change just because.  
---
It's possible, and I definitely wouldn't mind a specific currency by region, but unfortunately I don't think it's going to happen.
---
I dunno; I don't get on and off my raptor when I use it. That's more of a "get on the raptor and stay there for a while" thing.
---
This is only partially correct. There is no need to unzip it, the download links to the dll directly.
---
the d3d9.dll is not an executable file. you have to manually move it where it belongs as per the instructions on the site.
---
Raids were fun when they were added regularly. Fractals stopped being fun after HoT came out.
---
That's correct. I thought I remembered it being a zip file like GW2Hook or GW2Radial, but I just checked and it's now just the .dll by itself.
---
I like how the game isnt ready for such event after 7 years. Puts everything into perspective ;)
---
I guess the player limit for core tyria maps always have been higher than the hot and pof maps. and well  AB is bad coparison, because the people are split onto 4 lanes :D
---
Ok, I really need to learn how to use my camera correctly, cause my pictures suck.  I don't know how to look upward without zooming into my char and seeing their eyeballs
---
It does matter to a degree though, the laptop there has an i7 2500k i think and a gtx 680, it pretty clearly has frame rate lag and cant really run on anything but lowest settings. didn‚Äôt really compare the two machines properly yet, but on my gtw 1080 the 3 monitors there run its utilization at nearly max.
---
Lolz, i took a tape measure to it, diagonally its about 72 inches
---
Dunno, has he ever tried?
---
Only applies to HOT-Bags. Everything else can be opend anywhere in the world.
---
When you clicked on the download tray at the bottom of Chrome, it tried to run the .dll file you downloaded, which is not what you're supposed to do.
---
Yea it probably would look gross and i like the ui being normal as is, plus i can offload windows to the peripheral monitors like my inventory.
---
I feel like you'd get a lot of friction between the people who are and are not keeping up with the main group, more so than things like hp trains where you actually need to wait for the rest of the group and can't just finish it yourself (in most cases).  Gathering is already not incredibly efficient, and adding in a bunch of time just standing around waiting for the rest of the group to be ready to move on isn't going to help.
---
With that said, there may be some portion of players out there that would appreciate this as a way to do something mindless as a group, when doing a world boss train or similar would be more effort than they want to put out at the time.
---
So what am I not understanding then? What should I do instead of clicking the file in the tray?
---
Follow the instructions to install on the ArcDPS page.

FYI there is a "Save" button where you can save posts to view later.

Verdant Brink.

As the first map of HoT it sets the tone for the expansion and it does it exceptionally. The feeling of doom and having all the odds stacked against you with all of the events where you are just trying to help the pact survive the night.  The verticality and actual challenge of trying to complete the map for the first time, the introduction to difficult mobs.
---
The Pact Laid Waste &gt; Auric Wilds.
---
It's hard to put into words why i love this map so much, but when I returned to GW2 after missing both expansions, this is the map that convinced me returning was a good choice.
---
5-10 fps for me in areas that run fast, i.e. old maps. Less negative impact in new areas (where there's less GPU headroom I guess).
---
[This preset](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bd7pni/with_reshade_and_gw2hook_some_locations_in_gw2/ekwmvee/) looks interesting and affects your performance less in my experience.

Thank you, that was a big help! I got it working!

I have the same issue, sent many tickets. Their response was just use the app. They did not even understand that the sending of the sms was not being received.
---
&gt;  However, I can't deny the fact that it will quickly turn into a map completion selling trend.
---
I don't think this would happen, it would be too uncomfortable.
---
You have to interact with each vista and still do hearts on your own.
---
A single stretch by my meta human female would have made Balthazar succumb to her charm, but nooooo anet desperately wanted to include some kitty and it's burning stick in the story :/
---
\#unnerfidleanimations
---
Let‚Äôs be honest. It‚Äôs more of a collectible exotic. Nothing about it screams legendary
---
Which app were they referring to? 
---
Have you not been able to log on since?
---
For me it's a tough choice between Tangled Depths, Dragon's Stand, and Crystal Oasis, all for different reasons.
---
Tangled Depths has so many cool nooks and crannies, and the meta event requires a fair amount of player coordination, which makes it fun for me. Plus I really like the Chak as an enemy race, and I wish we had gotten more of them.
---
Dragon's Stand is awesome because it does what no other map has done: it makes you feel like you're actually at war and things are coming to a head. There are large military conflicts that rage across the map, requiring large amounts of player coordination and teamwork. You have recurring villians that stalk towards your forces, and take a lot of effort to defeat, and it all culminates in a huge semi-boss-fight that has you unraveling Mordremoth's secret weapon of enormous amounts of ley energy.
---
Crystal Oasis is one of my three favorites primarily because of the beauty of the landscape! It was the first really wide-open map that wasn't jam-packed with stuff at every turn, and that has enabled the designers to make incredible scenery that we don't see anywhere before Path of Fire.
---
You forgot the: \*Insert class\* is way underpowered and \*Insert another class\* is way more effective and fun to play, ANET PLS
---
 /u/Portrait_Prophecies early comics were pretty borderline, so that's why I made the Oglaf comparison :P
---
HUMAN SALAD
---
Oh my god I was already in love with the thing but then they showed the footfalls and I'm *even more* in love with it.
---
Buying enough gems to get the gold for the materials is totally a valid use of my quarterly work bonus, right? Right? :P
---
I'm not sure if you're talking about Duke Hunkleberi or Mouse Child.
---
The hunt for materials or swipe of a credit card does :)
---
Nothing in a video game is legendary either, so what is your point?
---
I learned that I‚Äôm terrible lol my set up isn‚Äôt perfect and I just started playing again yesterday after 2-3 years but good lord I‚Äôm bad lol
---
The footfalls are pretty. If I had a more crystal-themed character I'd try to make it but I need to finish up Pharus first lol
---
Perhaps that is it except their original post is total bullshit.  
---
Nowhere near "all" antagonists mind control their followers.  
---
I feel like a large number of people on this subreddit don't even play the game.
---
.....what footfalls??
---
Don‚Äôt use heal druid or heal fb for open world. Your experience will be awful.
---
I would recommend building a hybrid support quickbrand. It has decent dps, and supplies near constant quickness. It is the meta support for fractals atm in combination with a heal alacrity renegade. The gear is almost the same as that of the full dps dragonhunter build that has top tier burst, so you can easily switch between support and dps depending on the pug group.
---
Check out discretize.eu for fractal builds and guides. Snowcrows.com has more in depth guides, but the build itself is for raids.
---
Dungeons are very easily because of expansion power creep. It‚Äôs basically only about knowing the mechanics; healers aren‚Äôt used and booms are not required. Same thing with open world. You can play anything you want.
---
Went to go play in a realm called Real Life
---
true, the only generic animation that looked different was the throwing animation, which I think all but Reaper and Guardian has one.
---
I did this in Guild Wars 1, I would stand next to the Henchmen and see if they added me to party, and just followed them around like the henchmen would :P
---
The footfalls they copy pasted from Eureka.
---
Draconis Mons. Amazing gameplay, really pretty, primordus.
---
Time value of money changes when enjoyment comes into play.  
---
If you hate the process of acquiring the wealth to acquire the item then you probably would be better off working a part time job or extra hours.  
---
If you value the play time though, then there is inherent value there that is often overlooked by the ‚Äúswipe-the-credit-card-‚Äú argument.
---
Quickbrand seems clunky to use because of the cone effect on the Mantras so i don't think i'll like it, i just wanted to be sure about the OW because i want to play with a healing build but i'll stick with DPS i guess.
---
Thank you for opinion.
---
Low runes/sigils will be directly bought off TP from the people with Rune/Sigil extractors.
---
Once preexisting supply dwindles, legendary demand is relevant, and when TP barons realize the change in momentum price will increase.
---
Oh no, didn't mean you, more the people that are all "OH THIS IS JUST AN EXOTIC WITH A GEM STORE SKIN SLAPPED ON IT BLAH BLAH".
---
They're welcome to sell me all their mithril and elder wood then. :P
---
How do you log in without completing sms verification? Is there a way to deactivate it?
---
Ask them to send some Mithril and Elder Wood my way too, maybe some Mystic Coins while they're at it ;P
---
Imagine wanting to earn your trophies instead of buying them. Real talk though, I don't blame people for swiping for them, it's kind of unrealistic to just earn it considering even grinding in spots before they're nerfed can take a ridiculous amount of time to get one. The only way is to find a chink in the chain or loophole where you can get ridiculous amounts of money easy. One of which is flipping legendaries, but you need to get to the point of getting a legendary in the first place to do that. Clearly anet WANTS you to spend real money on these things.
---
Play through your main quest line as you would have normally.
---
Nope. Mesmer skills are light purple. Not an entire galaxy.
---
It's around hilt. Watch vid carefully.
---
EDGE EDGE EDGE
---
That's not true. Reaper has it on GS#5 and guardian has it on GS#5 as well as on Dragonhunter F1.
---
That's kinda awesome... It looks like it has different effects and forms for all sorts of different skill types, not just projectiles? I dig it!
---
Honestly, I prefer these kind of events over the ones where I *feel* I HAVE to participate or be left behind forever (Unique skins locked behind the do this for X days and you'll get the reward, repeat. Looking at you, Festivals). They give me massive burnout.  
---
 
---
Now I could just drop in *if I felt like it* without missing too much. Just some minuscule additional RNG rolls.
---
That is in fact true...

I like to sit and chill with Scout Acan‚Ä¶ been a while since I visited my old Hylek friend

It‚Äôs shown after the name announcement in the middle, wait for it at the end
---
Sorry gtx 680m, much lower power than a normal one.
---
Verdant Brink and the Desert Highlands are my favorites.
---
well sometimes the "few minutes" extends to hours :D
---
There is? I love the music in that map, seems like it‚Äôd be a pretty nice way to chill.
---
If I see someone in trouble, I like to swoop in like a dark knight to res and kill the enemy and then hop on my raptor to ride off into the sunset.
---
This thing better have unique effects like that for ALL the classes instead of just mesmer or I'm just gonna make something else, that will ruin this weapon for me.
---
Mind that lifting off limitations (if you had f2p account before purchase) may take from minutes up to few days - at least that's what people were reporting in the sub
---
Yeah, purchase tends to be pretty much instant, 3h is really long. But it takes 2 or 3 days to unlock everything on your account if you had f2p one.
---
What's confusing about "save d3d9.dll into 'gw2 install dir/bin64/"?
---
If there was it would be entirely pointless, because any attacker could do it as well. Only way to disable it without being logged in is to contact support.
---
You can play all of the base game all the way to level 80, including dungeons, personal story, pvp and wvw without buying anything.
---
Mantras also affect people around you, so as long as your group is not scattered all over the place you will be fine.
---
Ohhhhhhhhh boyyyyyyy!
---
&gt; or just take an achievement which shows you a map position 
---
:O Thats very interesting (and useful), thanks!
---
Fuck, I totally forgot all is vain. What a great post.
---
We do not need currencies for every little area of the game.  Think about how LS3/LS4 dailies turned out.  There are more dailies than you could possibly compete in any reasonable manner.  The game doesn't need dozens of different currency systems to track and manage.  If you want to add an additional currency system that's fine; doing it regionally? That, I strongly disagree with.  
---
There's no real reason to do so, and it's clear you haven't put in any real thought into this beyond, "Hrm currency systems are fun!"  They're not fun for everyone because they're an additional layer of abstraction between players, content and time-spent.  I have 7,000,000 karma at the moment.  I'd much rather ArenaNet put better use to existing currency systems than create a new one whenever they get bored.  
---
The idea of unique food or trinkets *sounds* more fun than it actually is.  Thunderhead Peak's meta-grind for Diviner's was an absolute slog for most players -- just extra time-gated bullshit, and Serpentite Jewels are almost that, a new and unique "currency" if albeit unofficially.  Locking certain stat-sets behind time-gated -- currency gated content isn't fun.  It's extra grind to ensure that an area has value because it doesn't have anything to offer on its own.
---
He decided to play ESO as that mmo is more interesting in his opinion.
---
Yes, I understand the purpose of sms authentication lol. My question was to the person who said they can log in while having the same issue of not receiving the sms code. It confused me. Thanks for the help
---
Clearly I was missing something or misunderstanding something. Do you see how this guy was helpful and you were not? Continuing to repeat ‚Äúread the directions‚Äù didn‚Äôt solve the problem.
---
Sometimes, less is more.
---
He cut and pasted the instructions from the page into a reddit comment. Somehow you were able to understand the words easier in a different font, I guess.
---
A helpful commander and Lieutenants can highlight nodes with location and map command markers (12 markers total), which would allows squad members to gather at their own speed.  This would cut out the searching time for most of the squad and make the group effort incredibly more efficient.  
---
The squad members can then swap toons and hit all the marked locations again and again on alts, with each alt hitting them just a little faster as locations become engrained into memory.  
---
Swapping to alt toons would eliminate any hypothetical friction and any downtime.   The biggest problem with this approach is that gathering is **boring**, but a guild on a discord could fight the boredom with lively discussion I guess.
---
If you're willing to just swipe the credit card you'd still be better off converting gems-&gt;gold and then buying those resources outright. The bounty boards take literal years to payout and require you to break from gameplay and go to your home nodes
---
Hey now, maybe Kralky is only smaller cuz went on a diet so he'd look good for our doom.
---
You paint the sky, ye they are.
---
 More violets, I *say*. *Less violence*.
---
Still waiting for them to show the GS on other classes like Guardian or Warrior.  atm it looks like if you don't play GS mesmer it's just a gemstore skin with footfalls.
---
&gt;Aaaaaaand it's gone!  
---
&gt;stuck in loading for me, at least
---
It is?  The whole site or the showing of the dailies?    
---
It works for me :/
---
I'd like to see a combination of things:
---
Successful gold level completion of a central Tyria dynamic event yield 1 dungeon token from the dungeon the zone is closest to (or a "stat selectable" account bound universal token that could be consumed to yield a token of any dungeon).
---
and/or
---
Make all central Tyria hearts and hero points repeatable, on a daily cooldown, for either the same token, or similar to LS maps, allow the completed heart vendors to sell you 1 per day per vendor, total limit of 3 or 5 tokens per account per day total.
---
Watch vid carefully
---
Still bruteforcing an old game with a GPU (1080) that can do state of the art visuals with ease at high framerates. It feels terrible.
---
Why level them to 3?
---
My merciless sword üó° &gt; your laser light üí° legendaries
---
Seriously think before going into BDO. Its far from being anything like gw2, the class are either nerfed of buffed by a drunk 12 years old. The game is made to have alt but isnt at the same time. Everything is class bound, the P2W debate has good points on both sides but to make it short, it helps alot to put money into the game but its far from mandatory. The game is gear based for the most part. Skill will only matter in equally geared fights. The gear uprading system is drowning in rng and can be quite punishing. Nonetheless I spent hundreds of hours in the game. It is a beautiful game, but coming back to gw2 after BDO made me realise and appreciate just how complete of a game gw2 is.
---
Second this. If there are fun shapeshifting effects for other skills for, say, a warrior (other than skill 4 which will likely get the same greatsword-ninja star treatment already demonstrated), I want to see it!
---
Yes, but most of them aren't very talkative and some appear to feel stalked
---
My favorite too! I‚Äôve been there so much I know the map by heart.
---
Those are good points, I didn't think about using multiple characters and running it more free-form.
---
Oh dear. This doesn't make the wait any easier. I'm going to rush to make this upon release so that I can make use of it while doing the story on my Mesmer.
---
I personally wanna see the bear on ranger's Maul to be replaced by 3 hooked blades (a claw basically when you bring it down. I also wish they would have shown the spinning attack animation from the front cause it looked like the blade changed but I can't be sure.
---
*releases in June due to unforeseen freak snowstorm*
---
Which software are you using for this? 
---
Nvidia surround?
---
Awesome! Remember my words in the future: longbow 4 is the most powerful skill in the game. Use it on cool down specially in a group (dungeons and so) where everyone can admire the potential!
---
Yeah that is weird, I use dx12 version with pop in fix that is supposed to use more ram but still I‚Äôve never seen it above 50%, also running everything on ultra except character model limit set to low at 1080p and I‚Äôm pushing 100-200 FPS everywhere. You should be able to get close to that with your setup unless you are playing on 4K or something
---
I like visiting the starting areas and offering to be a rez buddy/guide for new players since things like events and level scaling can be confusing.  Sometimes I will make a set of level 10 gear, including weapons, so they go into the story with better kit.  
---
If someone is active in the map chat asking questions I will often send them a mini of an animal with a bit of money with a note that 'here is a travelling buddy for you and a bit of gold to keep them properly fed as you wander.'   They have always been delighted and usually ask how you feed them.
---
I house-sat for my parents for two weeks a couple of years ago, and my step-father has a setup like this (he doesn't even play games, go figure), and I absolutely *hated* playing games on it. I tried it out for almost the entire time because I had been considering getting multiple monitors myself, and I could never get used to it. I was never able to unsee the gaps where the edges of the monitors met each other, strained my eyes a lot, and got terrible headaches that finally went away entirely when I just stopped using the two extra monitors towards the end of the second week. 
---
It was really disappointing, because I had been looking forward to playing in a cool new way, but after that experience I swore never again. 
---
Glad it works out for you, though! Remember to rest your eyes occasionally even so.
---
Honestly, they don't know themselves.
---
They have no clear vision of thief. They think they do, but their actions say otherwise.
---
That edit though, when you had previously claimed it was just a copy of Eureka. How cute
---
Actually you could have gotten credit even without providing the boons.
---
Twice I have gotten credit for matriarch because someone applied retaliation to me and I was hit by some of the attacks.
---
Oh, I didn't know about that guy. I know there's a couple strange things in the ledges across Silverwastes, like the skritt dancing around a dead giant's corpse, but that was it.
---
I'm sad to see they think so little about the plot's long term viability. GW2 deserves better storytelling than that from a soap opera's :I.
---
My ticket was answered just after 48 hours. It could be sooner for you. Just an FYI from my recent experience!

bah.  idc about eternity, but i would love to see them change for this new one.  that would look *nuts*

Tangled Depths; because it's a one of a kind masterpiece across all MMORPGS, and actually encourages adventure. It's not even complex to navigate (as others claim) once you make your way through it.

why not just buy the sword with that gold, instead of crafting - I'm sure someone will post it soon lol

Its a setting in the nvidia control pannel, select the gpu enable nvidia surround and configure it by adding monitors and rearaging them, once done hit submit and it will act as one monitor, once done open the game and tell it either full screen or edit the resolution.

I love you o.o

ArenaNet is showing Exordium on a Mesmer, they are pink &amp; purple &amp; sparkles &amp; butterfly's, if Exordium does have a visual replacement for Weapon Skill Trail Affects it is not presented. Just speculation, these assumed visuals were not hooked up to the GS when they filmed the video. And again, that's the visual affects of Phantasmal Berserker, the original comment talked about the Hilt having a galaxy trail but that's a visual part of the skill I am talking about. In the game it is only purple smoke and sparkles.
---
Did I say anywhere you should care about Eternity? It's just simple extrapolation that tells me what you're hoping for is unlikely.
---
There was a game for a time called Gigantic where this little girl used her greatsword to channel the spirit of her deceased father and previous wielder of said greatsword, and she could send her father to attack enemies and he would use a phantasmal copy of the greatsword to do so.
---
Anet, make it happen
---
You can't buy gen 2 and 2.5 legendaries outright.
---
Depends on the setup, the monitors are designed for this, high frame rate, small bezel.

oooh cool, im looking to build a pc for myself soon too, since im a total noob with building pc, im just going to copy what you have here:)
---
Thank you, I‚Äôll try to remain patient!!

oh...had no idea sorry. I don't have any legendary so I just assumed you can buy any since I saw some in TP

Their SMS provider is very hit and miss. After having that "hey, IP address changed, need to authenticate" and waiting for SMS like 2.5 hours I just gave up and switched to authenticator app. Use authy to be able to back it up and transfer to another phone later.

Thanks for that. Muched need info. How about Final Fantasy? I heard they are getting good and they have both Ninjas and Samurai which is like our thief but they are very viable in parties and they want them in the parties too.... unlike gw2.
---
you actually spent time to type that out in response to a simple comment.  i almost wonder why me saying idk about eternity offended you so much.
---
almost.
---
My pleasure. As for FF, I wish I could help you but I havent tried it yet :(
---
Who the hell would want that? What????
---
I picked mesmer as my first class and it didn't feel particularly bad. Of course I died less with necro (my 2nd character and now my main) but honestly, if mesmer is the worst the game has to offer leveling-wise then I guess I have nothing to worry about with any other class.
---
&gt; I think it would be great if there was a way to earn them outside dungeons.
---
you mean how there are pvp and wvw dungeon reward tracks that give out 3 weapons and 1 armor piece per track completion?
---
Welcome to the best rest of your life üòÅüëçüèΩ enjoy it!

So I recently hit lvl 80 and have now completely filled the exp meter beyond the lvl 80 mark and I get this nagging popup to go to the Heart of Maguuma to unlock masteries. The issue is, that'd mean I'd have to start the story of HoT, while I'm currently only at chapter 8 of my personal story. If I start the story of HoT, I fear I'd see spoilers and if I don't I fear I'm missing out on masteries (or "losing" experience, because my bar stays filled 635k/635k experience). So I have two questions:
---
1. Do I need to fear for spoilers if I start my HoT story?
---
2. Do I loose experience because my bar is filled and can't dump it in masteries yet?
---
It didn't offend me, it befuddled me. As it had nothing to do with what I was saying.
---
&gt; To those whining about this post: congratulations! Well done on being so welcoming to a new player! Just because you've seen these posts before doesn't mean it's fair to be nasty to someone just asking for some simple advice.
---
This honestly caught me by surprise.
---
I like reddit. So when I have questions, I come here to ask them because I like discussing with people and seeing different opinions.
---
Could I have just googled everything? Yeah of course. But why would I prefer just guides over players' wisdom?
---
I hope the in-game community is more welcoming.
---
Try directx proxy :) it helps a lot with minimal fps at the cost of memory consumption
---
Tangled Depths. No map after it has come close in complexity and exploration and the experience of actually slowly learning the map. Most other maps are instead just a flat plane with some interesting features.
---
&gt; Get your mounts in POF
---
&gt; Get your gliding in HOT
---
I'll definitely get those two since I already have an 80 and I do plan on leveling again.
---
Yeah cause someone who just started the game will be heading to the gem store to spend real money on QoL items.
---
&gt;loot crates
---
Hooray, everyone's most prized 'game' system;  ~~loot~~ gamble crates.
---
The collection-based Legendaries can be bought and sold. Any Legendary (most of Gen 2) that utilizes "Shards of" in their creation and lack a collection (so things like Binding of Ipos, Shooshadoo, and this new greatsword) cannot be purchased nor sold, as at every step of their creation they are account-bound. The wiki has a page regarding which Legendaries fall into which barrel.
---
There are two story seasons between Core and HoT, so that makes you'd be confused.
---
That does not say increased, it says adjusted. I'd have assumed they meant reduced.
---
It's not about being bitter. It's about a community that knows the game they're playing, and knows how it was designed, and sees newbies make this mistake all the time. Because of the way GW2 is designed, leveling a character normally is literally the only form of tutorial/learning that you ever get, so it makes players who love the game very sad to see people immediately jump in and use a boost and *then* ask what they should do. The very fact that you felt overwhelmed and needed to come here to ask in the first place pretty much proves that they're right -- you made a mistake by boosting, and now you don't know what to do, and other players really wish you had thought to ask *before* using your booster.
---
So please try not to be so defensive about it, and automatically assume they're being "sad and negative" just because they're frustrated to see the same mistake made for the thousandth time. It's not personal. They don't hate *you*. The GW2 community is actually famously good and positive overall (though of course there will always be exceptions), and it's pretty inexplicably bitter of *you* to judge the entire community based on a single reddit post (despite the fact that multiple people were very positive and *did* help you), so you're behaving no better than those who conveyed their opinion in a rude way before. It makes it seem that, if you enjoy GW2 and stick around to become part of the community yourself, you're just going to end up joining the ranks of the bitter and negative yourself instead of being what you expected others to be when you first arrived. Take the high road. Be better than those who were negative to you instead of sinking to their level.
---
That said, using a boost first certainly isn't the end of the world! As others have suggested, put that character on the shelf for a bit, and level another normally. Leveling is actually quite fast in GW2 once you get the hang of it, and even when you're new it's at least steady! Remember that nearly everything gives experience -- do hearts, kill mobs as you go, explore and make sure to get every Point of Interest and Vista that you see, gather from crafting nodes, resurrect the dead when you see them, participate in every dynamic event you see! All of those things will help you level. If you're looking to slow down and enjoy the ride, try following some of the dynamic events. They're almost all part of bigger stories, and often one event will lead directly to another in the chain. Some of the stories are really engaging, if you take the time to look!
---
Also don't be afraid to seek out information outside the game. There's a lot of information out there and the game is notorious for offering no/very little guidance on things, so it's understandable for a newbie to sometimes get confused or overwhelmed. Dulfy has guides for almost everything, and the wiki is also very helpful and can be brought up while you're in-game by typing /wiki.
---
Good luck, have fun!
---
But if I keep pressing the 1 key it'll eventually die right?
---
Pfft, that only happens in New England*

---
HoT and PoF maps are too busy, crowded and laggy for my taste.
---
South side of Wayfarer Foothils - I think that's the only map with a proper forest where I can chill without beeing constantly chilled (I'm looking at you Bitterfrost...). I wish we had more "calm" maps.
---
Looks nice !
---
Would never use it, couldn't stand the borders.
---
FFXIV is fantastic if you're okay with the combat being fairly static and questing being extremely boring. I'm not knocking the game btw, I'm currently subbed to it but those are some big gripes I have with it. XIV has great boss fights if you're into that, crafting is a whole entire game unto itself, amazing music, kinda small zones, inventory can be a pain (not enough space), great art and runs like a dream cause it was originally made to still run on PS3. You can get the base game + 30 days free if you have a Amazon Prime membership on Twitch. Oh also, beware that once you get to the 2.x patches, there's a 100 quest slog to reach the first expansion and it usually makes most people quit. It's a ton of fed ex style quests that is intensely boring and does nothing for the story.
---
You're not throwing the actual sword though, which was what I meant.
---
I've been waiting for that mount eagerly for so long.  I wish it would happen.
---
1). Sorta since you'd need to do the first mission in order to unlock the gliding mastery. If you're that keen on not getting spoiled, you don't really have a choice but to finish your main story. 
---
2). Yeah, it's basically wasted experience. Honestly though once you're able to accept HoT maps, getting experience is really fast and easy. Some map metas give upwards of 1 mil and there's event chains that give you a sizable amount if you do everything.
---
Same and I cannot wait to leave this area and its bipolar weather patterns.
---
Amazing. Thank you for the info!
---
Agreed
---
Its a super expensive build, the case is nice but a bit over the top. i would start with a build customizer site to validate compatibility first which should also help get an idea of costs, the whole setup i have is around 3.7k but you could get similar specs but less flashy for probably around 1.8k ish.

Much needed info! I will have to try it out. Thank you so much for the sharing!
---
1. Yes. The first instance is massive spoilers for the end of the personal story and all of Season 2. Like, the first 30 seconds recaps Season 2's ending.    
---
2. You're wasting It, but it doesn't really matter. You need **two** things to level Masteries. Experience and Mastery Points. Experience will not be your bottleneck. Once you're more comfortable with the game, experience comes in a flood. To give an example, when a new mastery is added, Most people have all the experience they need for it inside of an hour or two.
---
Cloudless skies turned to a small hailstorm in about a 10 minute span last week while bringing groceries in. I was not thrilled. Then just as suddenly it stopped about 20 minutes after it started (and just after I finished getting the groceries inside).
---
Last day of Supply Drop Requisition is the 21st. I‚Äôm fairly shre that‚Äôll be the release.
---
The team up we've all been waiting for
---
Yeah I get you.
---
In game I find 9 times out of 10 you'll get good answers to questions and people willing to come help with content that's tough to solo.
---
Map chat can also be fun for a good laugh and banter :)
---
To get Season 2, you need to buy Season 2, yes.
---
You can just walk over to the maps for Season 2; as the other person said the maps are just Dry Top and Silverwastes.
---
But being in the map is not the same content as going through the story.
---
Ah I thought ones like The Raven Branch could be bought and sold, my mistake. So there you have it, Gen 2 cannot be bought nor sold at any step
---
you have to say "Tybalt, that is enough"
---
http://i.imgur.com/fCWdg.png
---
Tybalt, that is enough
---
Is it? I thought it was 4 weeks, and I just received my week 3 yesterday.
---
Actually the last release for the supply drop is next Tuesday so it makes sense to release it then. They give people a week to unlock the stuff.
---
Your use of all-caps is peculiar and upsetting.
---
Not correct. Or not fully correct rather.
---
The codes are not region locked outside of China. You can, for example, but the game in Brazil and play on a German world in EU.
---
The fact I know exactly what POI you are talking about must mean something. I'll figure what it means after I finish exploring another map
---
There are people who use it, just not a lot.
---
There are 3 reasons for it, which are not isolated of each other and works together to cause people not to bother with it.
---
1: It costs significantly more than gen 1, as with all gen 2s.
---
2: The effects are too underwhelming, especially the footfalls and aura. There is also no trail; melee legendaries need trail to be identifiable and stand out.
---
3: The base model of the dagger is horrible, small, and unnoticeable, especially when compared to gen 1 (which is immediately identifiable at a quick glance).
---
A lot of Asian MMOs like black desert and MapleStory 2 have a term called "FailStacking", specifically related to their crafting systems (as upgrades have a chance of failing). You intentionally roll a bunch of failures until the success chance is 99% and then put all the materials into it for what you actually want to have happen. Worst thing that could happen is your gear goes from +16 to +17 and you start again.
---
Yeh I want a free mount for inviting a friend into the game. I also want a mammoth with a merchant and 2 free riding spots for my friends.....woops trying so hard to copy another game my bad.
---
And with all the teasers, the final Caithe story, the Skyscale stream, and who knows what else might come this week, I feel like the 14th might be a safe bet too.
---
It is used more than once.
---
Griffon?
---
I've seen other MMOs with 2 and 3 person mounts and they are rad af
---
Yeah, I like to hoard my loot and open it once a week, otherwise I have my inventory cluttered 24/7 and that's a no/no when farming. But even if I open stacks of 250, 20 times in a row, it has never lagged, freezed or outright crashed the game. Maybe my PC is too powerful, maybe my graphic options are different, or maybe it's because I have the game installed in an SSD, but it has never happened to me.
---
That was me once. I was just looking for something to keep me busy until mists of pandaria launched. I never did buy that.  I haven't been back to wow for real since I started this game. Did a few free weekends, but that only confirmed I'd made the right choice.
---
The "new MMO magic* for me for this game is long gone, but now it's like an old but favored friend.
---
#*"LEGENDARY!!!!"*
---
I'm having a good time. Even if I don't get any super rare items, I'm still getting a crapton of mats and salvage.
---
Gotta save something for Season 5.
---
I would join, if you created it in the EU.
---
It's a character from Castlevania tho
---
Just to clarify, MF does not affect Unidentified Gear.
---
&gt; How all of the game's problems would be fixed if it had a subscription fee
---
This would be amazing, most of the Gem shop stuff could be transferred to getting them in game based on achievements

Revenge of the Capricorn for the bell mechanic, or Eternal Battle Grounds for it‚Äôs constant action.

Now i wanna see a mouse child and hunkleberi fusion dragon ball style

Man I couldn't even play jormag the lag was so bad even with character models at min.

They sneak the boar quest in by putting yellow (neutral) boars near many major events and combat area so you can't help but tag them with your aoe. Before you know it, bam, ten dead boars.
---
Why Dolphin? Why not Zoidberg?
---
If you inspect the site, do you get any errors in the console?

Ow crap who im kiding we all already lost ours souls to the game...

bubble drake mount :v

Seahorse, since we aren't getting a Land Horse.
---
Win+shift+S
---
My sincerest gratitude for putting your heart and soul into that title; I still have fond memories of the colorful environments, the fluid gameplay, and the charismatic and inspired character designs. Voden main for life &lt;3
---
Oh, wow. Already 30+ pages out. &lt;3
---
All logic suggests that spear should be *the* main weapon type employed by most of the combatants.   
---
But we all know that it's not nearly as heroic as a badass cosmic SWORD, by definition, which is exactly why spears as a weapon class are an afterthought.   
---
But it would have been great if spear/trident were introduced to some classes in the next expansion, despite some overlap with staves. I guess the introduction of entirely new weapon types is off the table as that would require at least some retroactive work of adding that weapon type to at least some of the sets.
---
i've waited hours before receiving one. try again in an hour and if that doesn't work go through account recovery
---
Cannot get over how unfair the industry can be, some of the best characters I've ever played in the genre. Hugs dude :(

[PoF Spoiler](#s "Getting the Griffin lets us revisit the library and we see it swarmed with underworld demons, so an underworld themed boss like Shadow Behemoth could fit that area pretty well. There could be a pre event at the Tombs of Primeval Kings that teleports us to the library, much like the Mist Rifts do with the Riftstalker events - except the library should be another level of the Desert Highlands, to avoid getting people locked out.")
---
Yeah really don't worry about the "wasted" exp. It's only Central Tyria mastery exp, which can be easily gotten in Fractals, Dungeons, World Bosses, etc.
---
&gt; which day of may, 21 or 28, can't they just announce it like normal ppl
---
They can, as soon as they have an release date.
---
Imagine being able to pick that as one of your choices for private housing.
---
As a Chrono, I enjoy making noobs feel like literal gods in their first few hours of play.
---
Raid would've also worked fine. Entrance in the Tomb of the Primeval Kings, story would be reclaiming the library once again.
---
28th. They accidentally put it in the ‚Äúwar eternal‚Äù black lion bundle a few weeks ago. The bundle said it was available until May 28th. I‚Äôm guessing that is the date that they were targeting, but it might have changed since then.
---
The visit for griffon is in a dark and dying version that counts as a separate area.
---
Using it twice makes a huge difference. Not.
---
Would work even better as a raid reclaiming the Library, with entrance being at the Tomb of Primeval Kings.
---
I had that issue on one of my alt accounts.  Was able to log into the website using e-mail verification and cancel the SMS notification.
---
Gameplay: Tangled Depths. Navigating this map really felt challenging yet rewarding, there is a real sense of danger in that zone, great meta. 
---
Aesthetics: they do very well with mouthing areas in my opinion. Thunder head peaks, or desert highland. 
---
Cities: Old LA felt like home. I hate the theme park, doesn't feel like a city. I remember spending hours exploring old LA learning about every corner. I wish we had a district like system for the cities, i think it would help establish a better sense of community if u could just join ae1 and know there wiol be certain ppl to chat etc. 
---
I like Divinity Reach aesthetic wise.
---
Flipside is since there is no daily cap(this will become worse with the next iteration having no cap on boss loot) all other content in the game is suffering from a lack of players. I understand this is a "bonus" but it shouldn't become a new 24/7 farm.
---
So far last episode ended up with a pretty dreadful cliffhanger. If they announced S5 then there has to be a plot twist that will take our commander character somewhere else to carry about things we haven't think of so far.
---
So... "You must be 18 or older to purchase this Black Lion Key?"
---
I started playing when GW1 was first released.  I had been turned off of MMOs because of assholes.  The mix of populated cities and instanced maps was right up my alley back then.  Within a month I got my younger sister on it.  (I would have been about 25 back then and she was 17)  I don't think we ever actually finished any of the expansions.  We were too busy squirrelling all over.  Our mother often commented the only time we got along was when we were playing.  
---
Over the years we grew apart.  We stopped playing GW1 as other games came out and at one point didn't talk for almost a year because other things just seemed more important.  She got into WOW, I played SWTOR and several other for short bursts, never really finding a 'home' game. 
---
Then one day she was fired.  The first thing she did was cancel all subscriptions of course.  She'd call once and a while, asking if I knew of any jobs in her city even though I was a good 6 hours away.  We are not great conversationalists.  The silence would stretch on for several minutes as we awkwardly asked about life.  One day she admitted she was feeling isolated.  To save money she had to stop hanging out with her friends as they were a kinda pricey crowd and every time she talked to someone she always had to put a good face on it.  
---
I had picked up HoT a few months earlier because it looked interesting and had no subscription.  I offered to buy her a copy just so she'd have some entertainment.  I figured she'd probably play it until she was employed again then return to WOW.  Both of us were initially drawn to the links to the old game and chat about 'do you remember the Searing?' and 'Oh, hey, is he related to Gwen?'.  We were quickly hooked.
---
For the next several weeks she'd job hunt all day and we'd get on the phone and play our Norn Rangers (We chose without consulting each other).  Calls could last 2-3 hours as we levelled or explored.  Conversations would meander from life to game and back again.  
---
Eventually, her savings were running dry and I suggested she use the last to come to my city.   She stayed with me and found a new job within a couple of weeks.  PoF had just been released so I bought her a deluxe copy to celebrate.  The day she cleared her trial period we celebrated by killing Balthazar.  
---
We don't play as much (She refuses to play the latest LS episode because Tiami is sick and she refuses to play until she knows Taimi recovers, I haven't told her about Aurene or she'd probably never come back) but we still talk every day.  She never did return to WOW.
---
Honestly, if the nostalgia of GW1 hadn't drawn us to GW2 we'd probably be closely related strangers still.  I wouldn't have offered a room if she moved to my city.  She'd probably never consider moving here since it is so much smaller than the last one but she loves her new career and the benefits of this smaller city (Lots of outdoorsy activities.)
---
I only know of the league of legends version, what is the gw2 one?
---
Dooo eeet!

https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/forum/game/pvp/gf-left-me-coz-of-ladderboard

One dude whispered you so now we have thread about general community opinions? Dude... :)
---
I just find it funny that it is actually a thing you can do in GW2, but not in WoW where the meme was spawned(for SP).
---
It's absolutely beautiful. I was positively awe-struck when I entered it the first time.
---
Haha, this angle and lighting of DR was my computer desktop for a while. I still find new places, 3000 hours in.

I'm the dude from the "we can see your name" comment. Site is still stuck in loading for me too! (22:02 CEST)

No Errors in console. Browser Chrome. Adblock installed but it shouldn't matter since it's not showing anything.
---
Well last time I played heard it a lot, seen lot u videos about condi being cancer so yeah so sorry I opened a thread xd
---
What a lovely story. Thumbs up !
---
In my post I was mainly going off of weapons already in the game, if anything though, I think those weapons would be better than speargun amd trident yeah
---
But I mean in that same logic the skimmer isn't much use. Its primary use is over water/ harmful surfaces. So a few spots in PoF maps and the maps you mentioned as well. 
---
Some things are just rather niche.
---
I've done the HP train about 15+ times and I still get lost and die if I so much as take a step out of Order of Whispers. lol

That is very weird, try the direct link:  [http://helenekassandra.com/GW2DailyHelper/](http://helenekassandra.com/GW2DailyHelper/)    
---
If this works, it might be the referal causing some weird issue with some users.
---
But it's also an absolute nightmare to navigate.
---
I will have to lower resolution on the others or it will be weird. How do you set it up nvidia control to just make it one massive screen?
---
Killeen :'(
---
Maybe nerf signet of inspiration too just to be safe!
---
A senator is introducing it, but remember, this is the United States.  Expecting measures to protect consumers over corporations in the current climate is highly unrealistic.
---
I feel like it's the most truly immersed I've ever felt in a map. Makes it a great introduction to HoT and also makes fun an entertaining map I want to return to.
---
I keep hoping they‚Äôll release another book. Reading the law behind places, events and characters is so interesting and gives a whole new appreciation of the game. 
---
Though after getting around to reading Sea of Sorrows, and learning the history of Lions Arch a little more, I‚Äôm more annoyed by the redesign of the city now as it lost all that charm of a made up city ahah.
---
Ok, thanks for taking time to reply
---
You beat him, so he's upset that he lost.  This happens sometimes.
---
Mail him a Packet of Salt and move on.
---
I tried the direct link 10h ago and it wouldn't load either(still doesn't load). Tried to search for clues but I'm still too inexperiented in this matter (and to be honest I don't want to go into webdev anyway).
---
Also I'm in my home network connection atm. So it's no fault from the university network.
---
Lemme try another browser real quick.
---
Bah, I really need glasses...
---
It is 4 weeks. Week 1 was with the balance update on the 23rd, week 2 was last Tuesday, week 3 released yesterday, week 4 releases next Tuesday.
---
Oh yes, let me have that trident skin for staff!
---
Oh, there's goofy shenanigans comics before the storyline begins.
---
The flirting comics are great.
---
I wonder why it works in Firefox and not in Edge which shouldn't be Chromium yet? Normally Edge is your to go browser to test unsecure stuff every other browser would block but there is no error message either.
---
When I was using the various dynamic guides to level up the last of my professions, I do recall there were parts where recommended crafting a bunch of runes/sigils, usually because the amount of CXP you got for discovery was so good and the secondary components were dirt cheap. IIRC, this was typically Major upgrades for the end of the respective Tier of recipes.
---
Story locked behind a raid? But my casualness!
---
While precision in condi builds may trigger traits giving you more condis, presicion is not essential for a condi build, you make enough damage with Condi Damage and Condi duration. While in a power build power, presicion, and ferocity are essential
---
you can still do power damage without precision, it's not essential for both types of builds
---
Might be your cache. Do you mind trying to open the site in inkognito mode in chrome? To see if it makes any difference?
---
IF this bill should ever make it into law, and thats a big if, it will probably long before gw2 went into maintenance mode.
---
Your post gives me an idea.
---
What if instead of t6 mat boxes, each map would allow you to buy boxes containing the current week's map rewards, in exchange for tokens of the respective region?
---
at least it's just for minors
---
For sPVP, what is the difference between the top two Scourge builds - Blood Sage and Shade Fire? I started playing Shade Fire and I don't really understand the mechanics. Any tips for both builds? Not sure which to play.
---
Yeah. If this actually does manage to gain any traction, all I see it doing is leading to the creation of a video game lobby by someone like EA. The legislation gets shut down, and the already established lobby starts pushing their own legislation which allows for far worse things than lootboxes.
---
Part 3
---
Dodge roll is super effective, your now out of combat!
---
It really depends on what the issue is. There are internal prioritization that they assign to tickets, I assume.
---
This seems pretty accurate to when I obtained my legendary armor. I did it while also completing The Ascension, and it took about 4.5 seasons, with LOTS of repeatable chests. I‚Äôd have to check total games played, but think it‚Äôs right around 900 for that time period.
---
If its different resolution it will look terrible as it can only scale to the lowest resolution of the array. all 3 of mine are the same resolution of 2560x1440 i know it looks bad when you have one with a diff resolution since i tried it with my 1080p monitor, i dont think there is a way round that because it basically makes all 3 monitors count as one large monitor, not sure how the game knows to not stretch out the ui though.
---
The Hunters contract gives so few resources that it would take over a year to break even vs simply buying gems &gt; gold and getting however much you want from the trading post. And you get them all at once that way.
---
The Expedition contract gives map resources you can't buy, but it again gives so few that you would get more by literally just opening a single chest in that map.
---
I don't think either of them are ever worth it. Even the crafting nodes are generally considered to only be useful in so far as you can let friends use them. But these can't even do that much.
---
I had the same problem as you. I never found a solution for that pop-up, so I sucked it up and played as much of HoT as necessary to unlock masteries (it's not very much).
---
I don't think it spoilt too much really - as I remember it's only one line that pretty much explains how Zhaitan is eventually vanquished, and our heroes are wondering why it didn't work again against Mordemoth. There's also a couple of plot points that are a little confusing, and I re-played the required story chapters again at the right time and it made a lot more sense. In the end the QoL (gliding, not having the popup!) is worth it.
---
Tbh the droprate of charms (just like many things added recently to the game) is completely absurd. A friend told me that he got a total of 2 charms for 1 month worth of active playing, salvaging all drops he ever got. My experience was similar. Anet is obsessed by putting their .00000001% numbers everywhere, but it's just not gonna work for essential items that people need to craft basic gear upgrades. If you're dead set on having these stupidly rare things, keep that just for infusions and cosmetic shit.
---
Build tip, I'd switch Sigil of Torment for another of Bursting and go full Trailblazer
---
There is not much need of support in the open world. I mean sometimes at Dragon Stand in the tower defense things goes to shit i swap and then swap back when towers defense are done. Sometimes you run in to a situation that can help but like 95% of the time and 100% in core game it is better to kill the mobs around the person that is down so he rally.
---
Oki thx :)
---
Darn, I'm crying again! TT.TT The singing is beautiful though!
---
Aww, thank you so much! Hearing from people who enjoyed it is always greatly appreciated &lt;3333
---
&gt;You are a true hero!
---
Thank you so much! A fair amount of tears was also shed during the making of this cover, I can assure you ;__;
---
I mean you literally just created value, selling map completion. 
---
But personally, I would want it EXCLUSIVELY to stop in front of new players in one of the starter maps and tell them; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOy1EoX5T0k
---
You are a true hero!
---
And I'm left speechless by your kind words! ;_;
---
I DONT get what YOU MEAN. Everything looks GOOD to ME.
---
Always happy to see T4 players helping in T1. I would definitely do the same when I reach that point. Currently grinding T2.
---
Well actually never tought my the build I run to be tanky but no when u point it out like that yea stats go for it xd Also thx for explaining, now I can see why it can be seen as no skill but then again I rather fight till I die than run and reset, where the fun in that xd
---
Does anyone really care? Ofc not.
---
Did they manage to become the "top" player/team in some other game yet? Ofc not.
---
Can they play anything except mesmer yet? Ofc not.
---
Does any of that surprise anyone? Ofc not.
---
Are they even relevant? Ofc not.
---
Ofc not? Ofc not.
---
since i dont have a time machine i cant see what you want us to.
---
Dang I only have two 1440p time to sell a kidney so I can have a third
---
any details? linking deleted vod without mirror really isnt telling us anything
---
If the legislation is actually passed,  ANet will probably just introduce parental controls on accounts to sneak by it..
---
Do i have to know who that is?
---
that guy is still alive? lol
---
I like creating chill out areas in the guild halls. They‚Äôre just so secluded and there isn‚Äôt a whole lot of ambient life around, or guild mates or chat or anything. Lol But there are a lot of in game areas for sure. Lake Doric has a couple that are pretty nice. The bitter frost vantage point. Most of Auric Basin for me is just a giant jungle paradise. The waterfalls in desert highlands at the djinn palace.
---
Honestly, don't quite know yet. My current thought is just to have a picture of my main come up - but I'm open to suggestions.
---
i care
---
he got top in battlerite, and pretty good in other games
---
you dont need to multiclass to be great player
---
more relevant than majority on this sub
---
youre right, twitch bans dont surprise anyone. theyre as stupid as ever
---
Leveling my ranger is really boring, any suggestions on weapons/skills that make it a bit more interesting?
---
There's a reason why I keep an album of screenshots from different areas of the game.
---
https://imgur.com/a/VtVNe
---
World design in GW2 is really top notch.
---
I have like.. 32 full screenshot folders, I might have some calming stuff in there.
---
Wow, I completely forgot about him.
---
Damn, I don't know. It works for me :/ It sure shows when you look for GW2 related tiers, though.
---
Worse case, the 3 year warranty from the company should be enough to get a replacement if it comes down to it.
---
It wouldn't regardless. You literally still have to interact with all the HP, Vistas, and Hearts. Which would be a huge waste of time as a taxi mount. Not counting having to wait for people to load and then hop back into the mount every time you switch maps.
---
You might have accidentally shared an edit link. Like, the page you get when you're modifying it. There might be a separate URL to get it as read-only with the info already embedded
---
I would advise waiting untill the patch is released. Plenty of people will be makeing it and there will be youtube videos of it soon afterwards going into full detail of its animations. After seeing it might help with your decision before you waste your time and/or money on somthing you dont like.
---
you care because...?
---
The flocks of books!
---
From a meta perspective, it's worth noting some achievements in HoT are Sylvari only.  
---
Notably there's 1 achievement in HoT Act 1 that doesn't count toward the Act 1 mastery, but is Sylvari only
---
Thanks for sharing it!
---
Didn't know about that webcomic, it's really good
---
And how's this related to Guild Wars 2?
---
Nothing is disabled in the Netherlands at all though.
---
Greatsword, sword/axe, even axe/axe. Could use more active damage skills like Sic 'Em or even Quickening Zephyr. Could also take suggestions from [this guide](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Ranger_-_Longbow_Beastmastery) on open world ranger.
---
Selling map completion would be the last thing people do. You could do maybe 35% of a map without interacting. 
---
Takin people with you is value enough, people want this. Other games have a follow function, which basically is the same. 
---
Let's turn it around, I don't see any reasons to not make a mount that brings fun to the players. "Selling map completion" is off the table, so what are your arguments against this mount?
---
i did imagined the same
---
This was sent sometime after Jahai Bluffs. Before Thunderhead
---
Was he big in the PvP or the WvW communities, because I have legitimately forgotten what this guy's deal was.
---
I also got one that resurrects three foes. Well, it's boss week...
---
This is valuable information. Thank you.
---
last year??? Damn I have already done that content when it released.
---
Shut up and take my upvote!
---
I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel bad for you for caring.
---
There are more important things to care about.
---
I got that a few days ago too. It's from an earlier story step, chapter 3 I believe.
---
Yep, you can go and talk to her in sun's refuge like she mentions. Was quite neat.
---
If I remember it was supposed to be sent to you the first time you entered Lions Arch after finishing the story or something, I'm guessing the system just messed up for you
---
Ya that's true.
---
&gt;  finally add alternatives 
---
And what would that be? To me it would be them putting every item locked behind RNG on the gemstore with a price tag. Want this mount skin? $5. Want this shiny new sword? $5. Loot boxes *are* a evil but the alternatives will also be bad.
---
Then we have edge of the mists which can look spectacular as well...abandoned
---
BLC are not pay to win. nothing about gw2 is pay to win. its just cosmetic fripperies
---
I seem to recall they compared it to gliding. If you've ever watched someone with really bad lag gliding, you see them continuously falling, then rubberbanding back up to gliding height, then falling, etc. On their screen, they're just gliding. With a shared mount, there is no way to reconcile these 2 perspectives.
---
It would make the krait treasure infusions worthless.
---
[Does this help you](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/159ml1oahEyM6zWQ-oD4XQcHsk1mI5G6tVnjk_FOeinA/edit#gid=348011649)? Can also run DPS cals in [GW2power](https://gw2power.com/), [dT's gear optimizer](http://old.discretize.eu/), look at other charts, etc. In general you're right, it will matter more for power builds than it will for condi but it really doesn't matter. Take the example effective damage numbers and give them both let's say an 80% damage multiplier, the difference comes out to 1.94846% so even with multipliers the difference gets smaller.
---
We don't know that. Anet changed their mind about never adding mounts to the game so they could change their mind about some of those things you just mentioned.
---
I started playing the Friday after launch once I got paid. I came from TERA which, at the time, was a P2P MMO. I was on the RP server with a guild I had a lot of fun with at the time (we've since not gotten along but oh well.)
---
We looked at GW2 when it was coming out, no joke, because it had the ability to walk.  You could only run in TERA and it made some RP kinda awkward haha. So myself and a handful of the members bought it and tried it out, came up with a guild concept. I really liked it, and I was ultimately the only one that stuck with it, and have been playing it since. They all moved on to FFXIV or ESO, I think.
---
BLC is not just RNG; it rewards statuettes, which can be exchanged for guaranteed goods.
---
So, I don't foresee anything changing.
---
aaand the 4th post about the bill
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Storm_Tracking#Open_world_3
---
Also one of my favorite places and with my favorite cats.  Too bad you can't bring party members there - I'd love to show it off to friends.   Don't forget to &gt;!look up at the cliff behind you!&lt; from time to time. :)
---
They could just make the loot box items purchasable with statuettes.
---
Blc still have items in them that can only be gotten out of them that can't be bought with statuettes. Regardless of whether or not they are p2w, they are still a form of gambling. Thus Anet will, in some part, suffer the wrath of w/e legislation that comes out of this newly proposed bill.
---
Happened to me in Chrome only, in other browsers the site opened properly.
---
No, stop that.  That's backwards.
---
We do not live in a "mother, may I" society.  We live in a permissionless society where we are AT LIBERTY to do what we wish, unless we infringe upon the equal rights of others.
---
It is immoral to prohibit me from any behavior (provided I don't cause harm to others) just because some other person may be harmful to themselves.

Unless someone wants an abortion or needs to transition, in which case they must be stopped at all costs of course.
---
Omgwtfbbqkthxbai~
---
&gt;HP train? are the 10x heropoints on the maps in the xpacs repeatable?
---
No, but the Heart of Thorns zones can be difficult to navigate and about half of the hero points there are geared towards small groups. So it's very common for large open squads to gather in Verdant Brink and run through all of the HoT points together quick in about 2 hours while portaling players who don't have all the movement masteries unlocked. It's not an every night thing but a few guilds on NA organize them regularly and they're nearly always up in LFG on weekend nights.
---
Path of Fire, on the other hand, occasionally has HP trains, but they're more rare and less popular since its hero points are all soloable.
---
Tried copy pasting that into adblock+ whitelist. didn't work.
---
&gt; As long as you don't get any benefit/profit
---
You nailed it.  Plenty of people map break without issues, just don't use it to abuse other systems and you'll be fine.
---
Don't put words in my mouth.  
---
Abortion is a difficult case, because there are *two* people involved, not just one.
---
Encouraged!!
---
Ghosts of Ascalon and Sea of Sorrows were great.
---
Edge of Destiny, however...
---
&gt;This is banning cars to prevent drunk driving, and it's fucking idiotic.
---
You are as stupid as it comes then.
---
There is a reason why certain things are under heavy restrictions, gambling is *usually* one of them. And to compare underage gambling to driving a car is like what??
---
as far as i know it's totally fine as long as you don't have an unfair advantage ( like killing mobs from below ground so they can't ht you back)
---
i'm on EU, hopefully i can find one of those here too...
---
you should have deleted your account instead, o/
---
Good riddance!
---
For me capitals ARE player content. I chill in Grove, listen to weird dialogues in Black Citadel, find new ways to get in jail in Rata Sum and play my lute in Hoelbrak. Divinity Reach... well let's just say what happens in Queensdale stays in Queensdale.
---
For some players lore-rich locations with lots of hidden NPC interaction is the content and I am happy that cities are so big and so different.
---
The perfect maleable concept to get anyone you want ostracized.
---
The reason that gambling is heavily regulated is because the government runs lotteries and doesn't want competition.
---
What is this? Middle school?
---
Format this better, ill read it...
---
I got a lot of Mithril Ignots and Elder Wood Planks... especially to craft the precursors and I don't quite understand the whole shard thing, so if you can explain, please do.
---
Either way, I'll just continue to suffer till release.
---
Haha! Nice!
---
* *1:* Tangled Depths
---
* *2:* Draconis Mons
---
* *3:* The Silverwastes
---
Sounds like a lot of hot air from steamy old men, nothings gonna change
---
&gt; An official answer from a GM would be very welcome too
---
ask gm.
---
&gt; is it ok to do this
---
just don't let anyone know
---
Welp i‚Äôm on mobile and I really don‚Äôt know about proper formatting so this is the best I can do
---
Maps like TD show how far superior GW2 can be to other MMOs.
---
Your words have been taken under advisement.  I shall continue to speak my mind on the matter, though, even though you feel that my voice should be silenced at any cost.
---
I wish you a good day.
---
Wish they made more maps like it, there's no other MMO which could pull something like it.
---
Yea sry mb
---
And miss half the fun? :D
---
&gt; you feel that my voice should be silenced at any cost.
---
lol what?
---
&gt;sry 
---
than why its still here? liar
---
But does it count as an abuse to fly from a higher place with the griffon if you use map breaking for it? Sometimes you can fly over the whole map as a result.
---
Huge cities on zones of their own are fine, the lack of stuff to do in them is not.
---
I think they planned on doing more activities like Keg Brawl once upon a time. Wish they added some adventures here and there to make them more useful.
---
But liberty does not mean "do whatever the fuck you want". Part of the democratic process and the role of government is protecting people from the 'liberty' of others who exploit them. When liberties go completely unchecked then the liberties of others are trampled upon. This is process of regulation is what prevents a Hobbesian state of nature of rampant capitalism and exploitation. While you may be of sound mind when it comes to lootboxes, as /u/XiahouMao noted below, there are many who are not such as gambling addicts and children. Additionally, to claim that corporations have no control and exert no influence over the US legislative process is simply naive.

Leave my sucky sucky alone pls
---
gw2 need to exist for them to release more chair and mount skins
---
what legislation has prevented people from getting SRS?
---
Literally who
---
Meh. I want to be rewarded with something more substantial than some ascended mats like emp shards that're *very* easy to acquire, a couple of silver, a sprinkle of karma, and an unid bag.
---
Doing them once is enough for me.
---
Oh hey, I remember seeing you run with me all day yesterday! Good luck with your drops man!
---
I stopped caring about PVP when it stopped being legitimate
---
So day 1
---
You can get addicted to anything, why don't you practice moderation.  Not everyone needs to have protection forced upon them.  They will use this to shut games down including gw2.  Guess you'll be happy then.
---
[Jim warned you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y3TZSB2gjg)
---
Gw2 is definitely not aimed towars minor anyway
---
There is no pay to win in gw2 so it shouldn't be affected.
---
We at least [already know](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bj50ec/war_eternal_arrived_this_may/em6m77b/) /u/Anet-Chelsea
---
was a part of the team!
---
Its also clearly a riff off The Shining Blade. With Pharos and now this legendary weapons are looking rather 'cheap'.
---
I kinda feel sad when going there, knowing the Six had left the place, and all the servants that are there now mourn their departure. Such a beautiful place, filled with wonder and sorrow.
---
Shhh stfu we have enough currencies we don't need more.
---
What we need is easy ways to interchange currencies.
---
So much for respecting the players time.
---
New map New currency in sick of it.
---
So for example:
---
\- Flying to avoid a Jumping Puzzle wall would be an abuse.
---
\- Just flying around from a higher place is ok.
---
Thats how I understand it. Thank you a lot!
---
Thats debatable given the rating. There are many many teens who play/have played GW2.
---
Power creep has made core Tyria rediculously easy (as if it weren't stupidly easy to begin with). The amount of tokens that would be needed from a low level zone would be so insane it'd be as much of a grind as legendary gear to get anything appropriate. If it weren't, then everyone would get the rewards within days if not hours and be done with it.
---
Accretion is not the solution to this problem.
---
Who is he? I heard of teapot, deaxon and WP.  Was this guy also a streamer?
---
Back when I RP'd a ton the major cities were a godsend. No mobs to worry about, tons of buildings to run around in, and enough NPCs about that it doesn't feel barren. It's great for a setting. While I admit they maybe aren't as functional as they could be, I don't really feel like they are wasted resources at all. Making the world feel complete is a valuable thing.
---
Lootboxes are functionally gambling, therefore............
---
You understand we already ban kids from driving cars right? That's why your comparison doesn't work.
---
Make no mistake that these business practices are designed to prey on children and vulnerable people. It's like saying scamming someone should be legal because it "doesn't violate your rights"
---
I still like it a lot more than Eternity and its children, but those footfalls are honestly pathetic and need to last about three times as long, or else be much bigger.
---
This is not about p2w
---
You are forgetting to mention that you don't need to do anything in wvw to get your reward (yeah, flip a home camp every 10 minutes with a blob of similar farmers). Spvp at least gives you extra for being in plat+ and encourages to win, though most consistent soloq players will likely end up with 55-60% winrate once their mmr is established. 
---
So wvw-spvp-raids form a nice time-skill scale. Maybe not very nice, because intervals are uneven and it is more like wvw-spvp-x-x-raids, but proportions are there.
---
Yep.
---
Honestly, if you skip a jumping puzzle once a day GM's won't care.
---
If you take 50 alts and skip the same jumping puzzle 50x per hour to farm a rare currency and negatively impact a portion of the economy for your own gain, then you'll get in trouble.
---
If it feels like you are exploiting a bug for profit, don't do it.  If you are exploiting a bug to reach a unique view, take screenshots and post them here bc the devs would love to see it!
---
Well, playing the lottery is restricted to be 18 (at least in germany). I don't see why it should be different with other gamble practices. Especially minors should be protected from it. And its certainly not always in the parents control. If you think that if the game industries have to increase the age rating it wouldn't do much I have to remind you how many movies are desperately trying to be beneath certain ratings to improve market share.
---
Yes, not all vendors have all available stats, some stats are bound to certain vendors or expansion packs, some stats can only be crafted. Wiki is your friend with a lot of things.
---
&gt;\[citation-needed\]  
---
&gt;This is just a fig leaf to excuse the immoral intrusion into the lives of others.
---
Are you seriously trying to deny that gambling addicts and children are real things? Holy fucking shit lmfao
---
In this thread: wild ass speculation about business practices with no evidence misleadingly stated as facts in support of authoritarian regulatory regimes instead of informed parental oversight.
---
The hard sell most people would have with it is probably just why spend an hour farming materials when you can farm something else and get 10x more materials that you want for the same time frame. I enjoy gathering but it's quite difficult when you compare the time like that.
---
What kind of gear did you send him for base necro? Btw base necro is actually good for roaming on trailblazer+grieving/viper but unfortunately even if you have this gear on f2p account you cant equip it.
---
Mesmer gs1 changed the model of the sword a lot tho
---
Coming Soon ‚Ñ¢
---
I'm aware. I'm just saying that I *would* experience them again, if there was appropriate compensation.
---
I wish it could be a guild hall.
---
&gt;Abortion is a difficult case, because there are 
---
Only one of them is pregnant though. Why should someone get to make a medical choice for someone else just because they fucked them.
---
&gt; What you say is definitely true from an emotional stand point, but most people wouldn't call that grinding, would they?
---
I didn't call that grinding.
---
Hm, I don't think that one is that simple either.
---
While almost everyone can agree that going up to someone unprovoked and mugging them is bad, it gets a lot fuzzier as you get more abstract. 
---
The fundamental basis of all systems of government is the veiled threat of violence for those who do not comply. If you never file your taxes, you can possibly end up in prison, and thus as a result people DO file their taxes due to that threat of violence. Despite that, I'd still say it's done more good than harm, and is a net benefit to society.
---
I don't know you or your politics, it's possible you're completely opposed to the existence of such a system out of principle. But I'd say that the loss of liberty is acceptable as it reduces human suffering as a consequence.
---
Honestly, unless you really love pvp or wvw, don‚Äôt farm legendary armor in these two game modes. You can get the pvp/wvw legendary armor for much cheaper so might as well get the skins and farm pve legendary armor and reskin over if you like the pvp/wvw armor look. This way you also get the pve legendary armor skins. Even taken into consideration the time to get in high end raid, once you find a static, it much pretty easier to farm pve legendary armor.
---
Just use another browser right quick my dude and you would know right away what the problem may be.
---
I always thought that'd be cool, and it would draw f2players into buying pof after they had a joyride with someone
---
&gt;Power creep has made core Tyria rediculously easy (as if it weren't stupidly easy to begin with).
---
I massively agree. Core tyria needs a rework. Especially because of how hard GW2 needs to attract new players and keeping them interested instead of quitting before their first level 80.
---
Part of keeping new players interested should be the experience that they are having fun *now* instead of later. 
---
I propose reworking the meta events across most Core Tyria maps, and giving them map-wide objectives for players to work together. Using Map Currency as a bait for veteran players would allow the devs to keep some of those maps active.
---
Lornar's Pass could have the Twisted Marionette return, for example. But instead of spawning her on a 2 hour timer, maybe they could put down really tough Champion Steam Creatures scattered across the map. Defeating them raises a Bar, and fully completing it would spawn the Marionette. (Similar to how Silverwastes works.)
---
Then there are things like Dredgehaunt Cliffs. Maybe every hour it experiences a snowstorm (similar to Dry Top) and completing specific Dredge-related events would fill a meter. If the meter is filled before the snowstorm disappears, then maybe a biggass Dredge Mecha worldboss spawns (could reuse Iron Forgeman model?) and people have to split up and dps enemies while protecting priory NPCs that would expose boss weakpoint.
---
As for Orr, my simple suggestion s to finally fulfill on the tug-o-war concept devs originally conceptualized for it. Capturing a boss shrine will cause a timer to tick town in its vicinity, so all players can see and keep track. After the timer hits 0, an assault starts on the boss shrine. If you manage to fend off the assault, you get good loot, and timer tics again to next assault. However, next assault will spawn more and more foes and will also have harder enemies. Eventually it spawns enemies so tough that they overcome the shrine. For Straits this would be easy because there is only 1 shrine. But Malchor's Leap, you have to defend 2 Shrines at the same time in order to receive max reward. For Cursed Shore, you have to defend 2 shrines as well, but the Gates of Arah also happens.
---
Maybe my Dredgehaunt Cliffs idea sounds too ambitious. But the other ideas could probably be implemented without too much complication, and they would add great challenge.
---
On the other hand activities seem very low in terms of popularity.
---
Ohhhh misunderstood. Guardian has one in gs2i think. The spinny one
---
It should be used for something. I really liked the place too. Sad to go there now.
---
I mean good luck doing hearts on a mount? Or interacting with vistas...
---
Personally,  I feel the phrase "coming days" is more non-specific than using "coming weeks". That could just be me.
---
I love how we have now memed these images.

That's why I wrote "that doesn't even work"
