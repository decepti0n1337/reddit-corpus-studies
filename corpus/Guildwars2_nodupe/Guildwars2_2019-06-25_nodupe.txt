Did you expect people playing MMOs solo to be paragons of social acceptability?
---
You can only kill them one at a time, but there are several groups of them so you can just cycle through the groups and keep killing. Takes about 2 minutes to finish the heart with a griffon.
---
but all that results in is wasting more of the support staff's time.
---
Buy a new one.
---

---
Better, buy two, keep the second one as backup.
---
And the current one looks... bad. [What the fuck am I even looking at?](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/thumb/6/6e/Kessex_Hills_loading_screen.jpg/800px-Kessex_Hills_loading_screen.jpg)

We will never have a playable race that cannot wear back items.
---
She will be able to play the core gane but obviously not the expansions
---
[Just buy the wings](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Largos_Fin_Backpack)
---
Ok. But she won't be locked out of being in party with me or anything?
---
Well, all in all it's called tactic. If none of both want to give up their benefit, you have to look for another tactic. 
---
For example, use barrage to cripple and prevent blocks, take the Smokescale or a similar pet to knock down your enemy, run around the corner as soon as your enemy is knocked, do your dmg. 
---
And/or, if you play Soulbeast, melt with your pet after the knock down, use F2 to port to your enemy (and stack some might) knock down again with F1, do some dmg with F3 and kick him away with Longbow 4. Then do your dmg. 
---
Also you have (limited) access to stealth (Longbow 4, Smokescale's smokefield + blast/jump), you can use that to easily run around the corner and knock your enemy away from the pillar.
---
No: she will face some restrictions in the types of communication that she can do with others (and there's a wiki article on the subject), but she can party with you just fine.
---
It's debris from the Tower of Nightmares over the coast. The tower was mostly wood structure and metal sheeting, not counting the giant toxic stalk in the middle.
---
Cool. Thanks!
---
Post processing doesn't really do much, in my experience character model limit and reflections are the biggest offenders to me alongside with shadows (although I only get lower fps when setting them to ultra, low vs high gives no difference)
---
Nah, but she can't talk in mapchat or use the TP for a lot of stuff.
---
Doing them when they're daily is the usual recomendation, as well as reaching out to your guild if you have one.
---
[Burning Auramancer](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Tempest_-_Burning_Auramancer) after finding it two weeks ago; it's pretty satisfying having my Ele no longer be paper in open-world.
---
She's an extremely powerful mesmer to the point of binding someone to her will and *fake-branding* a fort and its inhabitants.
---
Season 3 saw her not only repel artillery by herself, but made a shield (and maintains it for however long) *around* Divinity's Reach, while at the same time pulling an "I am The Senate" move.

    Queen Jennah: For this reason, I'm hereby suspending the Ministry until the danger has passed.

    Queen Jennah: Some of you will understand it's for your safety.

    Queen Jennah: Others will understand that I have trapped them here, far from the White Mantle's network.
---
Or hear me out here.... they learn from their mistake. Its not like the game gives zero warnings, or hides what the mystic forge is doing. You literally put in 4 items and get something else that is not one of those 4 items in return. Players need to be allowed to fuck up.
---
Reforge in any other game I've seen it used in only refers to changing the stats of the item on some way, so that's still the same thing.
---
in wvw it's single handedly made condi's irrelevant in zergs, that's how good they are
---
Saw that myself yesterday
---
I should try this again. I enjoy the visuals and abilities I just was not playing it well I’m guessing. I died a decent amount when getting multiple enemies on me at one time.
---
This definitely sounds fun, I will have to give it a shot.
---
Wow that would be really nice. I don't know if using a key would be a waste with her or not yet. But if it's collecting dust then you can toss it my way
---
You can play with her, though it'll be just the core gameplay, i with my brother also play like this, trying to hook him in haha
---
Also a possibility. Her domain is light and she acts like a prism for different magics, so W or &lt;&gt; is more fitting imo
---
Even in PvE. Getting gimped out of being "meta" in a raid or fractal because of the race of the character you made 6 years ago would feel *bad*.
---
It’s worth mentioning but as far as I am aware, all methods to acquire Funerary Incense require Amalgamated Gemstones to some degree.  The Elegy Mosaic method also requires Ecto, Obsidian Shards and Amalgamated Gemstones.  
---
Amalgamated Gemstones are kind of a pain in the ass to obtain in my opinion.  The Coin Rush meta-event rewards 1 Amalgamated Gemstone per day (which is technically time-gating).  You can also pay an arm and a leg to obtain more via the Trading Post or Mystic Toilet Recipe.
---
Not having a hissy fit.. and I explained in my original post. I dont EXPECT it to be implemented. Im merely curious as to how players FEEL about it.   
---
I think it was an amazing map, and this would be an incredible way to bring it back and restore it into the game. We already know things exist in places where they actually... well... do not.  (Super Adventure Box anyone?) 
---
Look beyond 'It won't fit on the map' and try to think of why it wouldn't be an overall VERY positive addition to the game.
---
Oh sorry, was editing in this part;
---
&gt;  Maybe the entrance to the Guild Hall could even be like at the bottom of the Wreckage of the Breachmaker. Like the magic from the Leyline's tear, the portal technology Scarlet was using, and just all the random magics from every different attack and incident just fused over the years into this small pocket within the Mists that became a reflection of the city in recent times. Kinda like a magical photograph snapped as Scarlet pierced the Leyline.
---
before I saw your reply mentioning the entrance being under the Fractal Portal. That could work great too, and would probably a lot more convenient (plus visually more appealing). Plus I think the explanation could still work with that too! :D
---
Did anyone actually play ritualist in gw1?
---
So, one of my favorite passtimes is bumming around the GH, trying to see what I can get into.  First with a glider, then with a bunny, then with a griffon, and now with my Skyscale.  I didn't actually realize how high I was up til I saw an odd non-existent updraft and flew toward it, and realized I'd gotten \*on top\* of the Gilded Hollow.  I managed to catch the view at sunset.  This may be old hat for some, but I figured I'd share the view with the rest of you.
---
i too would love to mount a largos and complete challenges
---
a lot actually, it was meta farming in uw when i played
---
But it's a bunker condi weaver.
---
But you acknowledge there are two ways it can be interpreted. Same with the "that's so gay" I understand the ironic humor if it, but gay is also very often used as derogatory. There are two interpretations to both of these comments. Neither is the correct interpretation unless the OP's come out and explicitly state their viewpoint.
---
So knowing that, people should understand that people that do find the humor in them, should not be portrayed as hateful unless they've explicitly said something hateful. 
---
Yet myself and others are getting downvoted simply for taking an objective approach and viewing it differently, viewing it more positively instead of just immediately thinking everyone's out to hate on everyone.
---
You tell me whos doing the hating here. Not saying you are, but others in the thread who immediately hate and judge others for finding the humor in a comment. Instead these people are the types of people who read their own interpretation and think their interpretation is the only correct way and damn everyone who has a different viewpoint. 
---
I also find it hard to believe that a reddit community, and video game community, didnt see the trollish nature of the comment. Trolling is often done to evoke emotions out of others simply for the humor of it. Surely this community knows that. So I dont buy that they didnt find the humor in it, even if they didn't laugh, the joke is obvious to me and should be to others. Instead these people are just looking at ways to feel like social justice warriors more than anything. They want to feel good about themselves by downvoting all the edgy comments to protect the gay community. Yay! In reality they're just overreacting.
---
The point of elite specs is to introduce new weapons to classes.
---
During the beta there was also a different login screen, wasn't there?  I remember being slightly disappointed when the launcher was added and preferred the previous login option.
---
Damn, if only Anet reverts changes for other things not just this.
---
Should be: sacrifice 4 nonland permanents that of the same type. Reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a nonland card that shares a type with the sacrificed cards. Put that card into play, and the revealed cards on the bottom of your library.
---
I love seeing stuff like this.
---
My old groups(quit gw2 sometime before wing 6, just came back for wing 7)used druid tanks a lot, except for deimos and wing 5.  Druid tank on xera was nice because it made sure there was always a healer on the platform, all you had to do was drop healing spring before she flurries and it cleared all your condis.
---
i understand that. though I am a new player i have unlocked elite specs on a few classes..none of which actually use the new weapon, just the abilities..(Reaper with no Great-sword, Scrapper with no Hammer, Dragon-hunter with no Longbow)
---
The elite abilities are great, but the weapon skills don't fit my specific play-style for those characters...
---
i understand I am very new and have much to learn, but in my limited experience the elite specs weapon abilities are less desirable than those of other weapons..
---
I don’t see why people are adverse to seeing other classes being able to tank. The go to response is always, “well chrono can both mitigate damage and do buffs, whereas other build can only do one of those.” Ok...we know and get that,  it is that healthy? Should one class have all that power? Should other classes either not be able to do the same? Or maybe change an aspect of chrono to bring it in line with other “tank specs”? It seems to me that chrono is way too powerful if no other class can fill as a tank and be just as proficient.
---
It's a *very good reason not to do this*, not at all a piss poor reason.    Guild Halls have always been part of the world map and this idea is a distortion of reality.  Every time this discussion comes up, the best idea to incorporate Old Lion's Arch has always been as a Fractal.
---
That was a design decision why make completely new weapons when you can move current weapons onto a class that can't use them. If they introduce new weapons they would come with elite specs thats the concept.
---
But isn’t that a problem? Should we not then be asking for chrono to be changed/nerfed or other “tank” be buffed/modified to be able to fill that same role/demand?
---
Thx time to pray for the daily to drop then
---
Hope you can change the world and make tank scrapper populair! 
---
You got my vote! :D 
---
Engi is my main! &lt;&lt;

Racial items came out very early in the game, when the best gear was exotic and it was soul bound when used.  Racial skins were not a problem back then.  
---
As the game progressed, they introduced ascended gear that was account bound.  
---
Ever since, I have wanted to see a rework of racial armor so that it would display one way for the intended race and then display some generic, plain skin when worn by any other race so as not to "invalidate" the ascended attributes of the armor piece.   
---
If they made that change, I would be alright with most of your suggestions.  As far a food goes, we don't need any more food.  We have too many foods as it is.  So many that some new foods are giving the same stats as pre-existing food.  
---
I do want racial mounts, and any way we can get them, I would be in favor of them.  Fern Hound (jackal), Charr Car (raptor),  Golem with rocket boots for vertical travel (springer), Corrupted Griffon (griffon, Norn mount, not completely sold on this one) and something for the humans that I have not though of.
---
I also like the axe/x condi mirage for open world.
---
I find it does a good job of giving enough burst early in any engagement to wipe out the vast majority of open world mobs, but also backs that up with enough sustained damage in the form of conditions to keep pressure on vets/elites/champs. Throw in the copious damage mitigation of the Jaunt elite skill, huge dodge availability with sigils that give you a free 50% endurance recharge on swap, and vigor on shatter and it makes for a build with great self-synergy. You use your damage avoidance (dodges, Jaunt, f4) to avoid damage and the dodges let you deal *more* damage via ambush, Jaunt gets you another clone up, and f4 gives you vigor to get ready for another dodge &amp; ambush. 
---
It just feels like a build that never runs out of options to both survive and deal damage all at once, and at the same time doesn't lock you into a long fixed rotation that punishes deviance (weaver, chrono...) or requires a lot of set up to get to the big numbers (rifle deadeye).
---
2 guilds...one is a personal bank guild, the other was a small friend group with like 10 people that don't login anymore. Nice try though...I guess? Also I never said I play solo to begin with, so again, reading comprehension isn't your forte. Care to try again?
---
Old LA just seems very poor and unmaintained. You would think after 250 years people would get around to using proper building materials and not just pieces of wood that are falling apart.
---
Welcome to the GW2 subreddit, where we ignore any sort of learning curve because that lets us act like anyone who's challenged in any way by the game is just mentally deficient.

Satispointed?

Even if you're facing a burning auramencer, an ele on cd will die if you breath in its face. It has the lowest health pool and armor of the game. At 14k health you can kill it in a single Longbow 2 if you get it right. Even with trailblazer, an ele will never last long if it's on a dps build and it plays on the defensive. It just doesn't have the health pool to absorb a lot of damage. 
---
If you're the ranger, and the ele was hiding, why didn't you just use Longbow 5 with your pet to drive it out and force him to waste one or two dodge? Or any utilities with taunting like protect me.
---
&gt;del in Langmar’s Estate it’s probably more likely that it’s from during the war in more recent times.
---
It's a ghost version of the Legionaire sword:
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legionnaire\_Sword](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legionnaire_Sword)
---
Humans don't have Legionnaires, it was part of the charr themed Legionnaire weapon set.
---
They made a ghost version for Langmar estate because you put it into the hand of a charr statue.  The human statues in the same room have a ghost version of a different sword:
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Royal\_Ascalonian\_Sword](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Royal_Ascalonian_Sword)
---
Which also makes sense since that's a human themed Royal Ascalonian weapon set.
---
Is it necessary to get those +stat/+ar infusions from fractals? Is the stat increase even worth the effort? Also, is there any chance that the max AR requirement can increase from 150 in the future?
---
I just wish they make that darker night potion from WoW. So i can enjoy the darkest night anywhere i want.
---
love that cantha spoiler &lt;3 &lt;3
---
You are not talking about tanks you are picking at the current buff situation and classes that are able to provide them and those that are not.
---
If you would look at numbers or ever played with a decent chrono and a Renegade/Quickbrand group you would have experienced how wrong it is to cry for buffs or nerfs what ever way.
---
The Renbrand Duo is, even if your two players are totally new to their classes, able to provide 100% uptime even if the group moves around, while also providing Might, Furry, lots of Blocks and a lot of other useful stuff towards their group only, which makes that subgroups life a lot easier. 
---
The Chrono is dependent on his Druid to provide pretty much all the might and some Furry. Both are a Duo. Both need the other one to do their job.  A single Chrono isnt able to do all the buff work for a subgroup.
---
Gotcha'
---
How did it get cc'ed then?
---
Its probably because people who dont agree with you have better taste, are not blinded by fan boy syndrome, not hating but rather looking at things at a different perspective, possibly clearer and thus might as well downvote him because he does not agree with your hero.
---
Im sorry that you cannot grasp the concept that in a world where exists things like Fractals, holograms and Super Adventure boxes, that a guild hall instance can NOT viably exist.   
---
No. SAB isnt per guild. Its per person... which... IMO makes the GH argument even more feasible. LOL   
---
If one person can generate an instance for an entire world for their own party - why not a guild for a GH?   
---
I fail to see your debate holding water.  I feel as though you lack imagination.
---
And that link is a better video even though its older due to having actual in game footage and did not made me sleepy.
---
You're the only one getting embarrassed now.
---
I think I read somewhere that the infusions are like &lt;2% of your dps. Literally the last thing you want to work on, and not something to really focus on.

Try reading my original comment like this. "Guys I can see how this can be contextually negative, but also try to see the humor in this post". Thats how I meant it and thats how it reads to me. Theres nothing wrong with what I said and its healthy for people to look at all viewpoints.

Tanking in Raids: may lord have mercy on your soul if you slip up with an elitist group
---

---
Thanks for the advice!! :-)
---
I'm waiting for the update as well to see if anything changes..
---
nothing will replace chrono tank until anet gives other supports class ability to give both quickness and alacrity + some kinda distortion.
---
It looks way bigger in the loading screen than in the actual map.
---
Cap camps,  kill dollies,  take sentries,  kill people, open and try and take undefended towers (moderatly hard solo, ez with 2 so call out in map that you open it). If you see 2 enemy groups fighting tag as many as you can. Use wxp boosters.. Btw what server are you on? If I may ask?
---
There are a number of different tokens in WvW, but the hero point reward ones (Testimony of Heroics) come from two main sources: levelling up in WvW and purchasing from Skirmish Chests.
---
Skirmish Chests are rewards you eventually get if you spend time in WvW. You work towards them with pips, which are rewarded every 5 minutes so long as you've at least gotten Tier 3 participation (mouseover the green bar on top of your minimap to check your participation tier). You will slowly earn skirmish chests over time, but they only award 6 testimonies each.
---
The more "active" way of farming testimonies will be from levelling up. Levelling up in WvW takes you 5000WXP per level (it doesn't increase from level to level). As a solo player, you'll want to be doing the following:
---
Killing NPC guards and scouts (20 WXP each)
---
Killing dolyaks (50 WXP each)
---
Capturing sentry points (the flags on the map) (100 WXP each)
---
Capturing camps (200 WXP each)
---
Sometimes you can get a small group together to capture a tower (400 WXP each)
---
Killing other players can get you anywhere from 3-60 WXP, and if you're a good PVP-er, you can probably do a brisk trade solo-roaming and preventing other people from doing all of the above-listed activities.
---
To speed up levelling in WvW, pick up a WvW experience boost from your guild, use an experience booster and/or a celebration booster - these really add a LOT of value to each small objective you capture! (e.g. 25 camps for 1 WvW level can become just 10 camps if you have an exp and a celebration booster)
---
The fastest ways of levelling in WvW will always involve following a group. Even if your group gets killed repeatedly by other servers, it will at least be able to hold enough supply to capture towers and to very swiftly capture camps - and you might be able to take out smaller groups of enemy players for a few hundred WXP.
---
Getting testimonials of heroics just takes some patience, even as a solo player with no friends in a server that keeps getting smashed. Good luck.
---
&gt; Im sorry that you cannot grasp the concept 
---
Ok, the idea of old LA works as a fractal.  Moto and Dessa are not using their inventions for your guild to allow you to jump back in time on demand to visit your guild hall.  I am disabling replies to this because I don't want to see another "Im sorry that you cannot grasp the concept" type comment.
---
Maybe as a compromise, an over-costed Destroy a legendary or something like that.  If you do, flip.

I just want to add, that you can put a wxp-enhancement in your Ascended amulet (if you already have one), too.
---
I don't think you understand the concept of WvW roaming.

Racial mount pack is a awesome idea. Born kind of have some in form of the shiverpeaks skins.
---
Racial cosmetics are the way to go. Race-specific abilities are a bad idea.
---
While we are at it, males should be stronger and smarter than females. That would bring an end to the boring human female meta.
---
This may be true when just looking at the traitlines. The gyros themselves are extremely support oriented.
---
So people on NA aren't raiding in random groups? Why not?
---
Probably new maps, or updating old ones
---
All of my friends quit between HoT and PoF. Daily fracs/raids/whatever other time fillers we got to, we'd pretty much just chill from reset until late at night. There were so many of us in TS we'd have an A team and a B team lol. Now pugging and keeping up with the meta (pug meta anyway lol) is just exhausting so mostly I just farm open world now. Raid Training is awkward because I'm too good for all the beginners and not good enough to just join pugs. Learning new fractals in a pug is a hassle as well so I just skip them now, I used to at least do all my frac dailies at reset. Bar 100 CM because all of my friends quit before it released and I never learned the mechanics, at least I have 99 cm down. rip
---
It’s apparent from this thread that you have something against chrono - let me ask you, though. Has it ever crossed your mind that of the “support core” of raids - chrono, druid, and warrior - chrono is the only one with a replacement? Banners are irreplaceable, and Druid is the only build that brings spirits, spotter, and perma 25 might and fury on 10 people. Chrono at least has options that can replace it.
---
I roleplay from time to time, but generally I solo everything.
---
Sometimes I run HP trains in PoF or do Mastery trains. I also run around maps, helping random players with whatever they need on the map.
---
I find it nice to do things at my own pace, when I focus on stuff I need to do, but it does get a little lonely sometimes.
---
When pugging I usually do Fractals. Maybe I join a meta or bounty train as a healing spec to help those with less sustain to survive.
---
Whilst the content is still definitely doable you are seriously limited to on maxing dps and get cucked on most every rotation with that ping.
---
Right. I've done BS on Qadim the Peerless. CCing distortions in the fire *is* awkward.
---
For the lightning, that's just bad RNG. Happens. But I think you can take a hit without downing, if you must (though it'll definitely hurt). You can also stay in the lightning and dodge roll. You can also use mace 2 to block it.
---
As for rezzing, you shouldn't do that if a distortion is about to spawn—it's on a timer starting at 80% IIRC. Killing the distortion is higher priority than rezzing a teammate. If the distortion doesn't die, then your entire team will die. There's no point in rezzing somebody if doing so puts the entire team at risk of dying. Non-pylon DPS need to be on rez duty ASAP. Even off-chrono needs to pay attention for rezzes.
---
WOW REALLY WHO?????
---
So enter Beast Mode right before the pet dies, then leave it to fully heal your pet. If they wanna play stalemate, you can play stalemate too.
---
Everyone has statics and everyone else either cant find a group or thinks raids are only for toxic elitists. There are LFG groups of course, just not many, and in my experience a lot of them are simply static’s that are down a member for the day or something.
---
Anyone remember when we had a loading bar instead of the circle?
---
Sorry. I didnt find that to be an attack at all. I was lamenting that you couldn't look at the overall big picture of how many things in game can't always be solidly explained. Not everything is logical or even practical but it still works. This, IMO is a lesser offender than many others.
---
Portals aren't used in most raid strategies outside the really cool strat at Qadim (Largos portal strats are kind of a wash IMO, if your group isn't skilled enough to kill it normally you're going to have a bad time with the enraged final platform in portal strat). 
---
Focus pull is the most busted utility in the game, i fully agree with you there. Totally trivializes any adds that aren't unpullable and there's nothing else that can compete with it in that role.
---
"distorts" are just aegis share which the firebrand actually does better than the chrono.
---
Separate weight class for racial armors so asura ranger can mix Savant and Electro in wardrobe.
---
I also play WvW mostly alone. I generally capture camps, monuments, land, etc and that usually results in some experience and reward track progress. If you’re good enough at the game, you could even kill a few players from other teams, though I haven’t done that yet.
---
There is some stuff you definitely need a group for, but if you stick close to home you can find plenty to do.
---
TY!!!
---
Okay that explains my dps loss I noticed, good to know :D
---
This is an interesting idea. Sounds like it would be similar to Dry Top, where there’s a sandstorm every hour or so, or Bitterfrost Frontier with the Koda’s Flame. Problem is, applying agony would be hard, since lots of people in open world wouldn’t want to put in the effort to craft ascended gear.
---
I was just having fun with it.
---
&gt; adverse to seeing other classes being able to tank
---
Any class *can* tank. If you form a group and your tank is a minstrel tempest or firebrand or whatever, it might not be optimal for speed clears but you'll get the kill if people are skilled. In progression groups, tank minstrel tempest is actually really popular because it can cover for a lot of faults (since progression means nobody knows the mechanics yet, you assume mistakes will be made frequently). 
---
It sounds like you're confusing "is optimal" for "is usable". Also, Firebrand or Renegade can be even *more* optimal in the tank role than Chrono, depending on the rest of the squad.
---
Theres a spot in DS with 6 or more smoke scales in the same place. You can farm them there while the meta is happening or for a bit after it ends.
---
Renegade/quickbrand don't replace chrono at a 2:1 ratio. Renegade provides its alacrity to the *whole ten man squad* unlike Chrono which can only do it for 5. Renegade and Firebrand are also capable of more DPS while providing their boons, leading to the *actual* optimal setup at most bosses being FB/Ren/Chr instead of dual chrono.
---
It could be a blanket set. A skin that can apply to any race, but changes appearance based on the race applied to  
---
I will also suggest my thoughts..  
---
Asura, tons of options.. from holographic parts coming alive, to general floating parts springing out of the armor.  
---
Norn, something to do with the spirits of the wild.   
---
Sylvari, Armor that 'blooms' when in combat.  
---
Human, something dealing with the Gods  
---
Charr, mechanical armor with moving gears/parts.  
---
  
---
Another thing to consider is each weight, and how each can give a unique representation the cultures that feels fitting for the armor weight.  
---
I also wouldn't mind if we had Class armor at some point.. not even legendary quality, but just something only wearable by certain classes to really bring out their general themes more. I'd kill for armor that adapts to my Attunement on Ele.
---
In "elitist" groups, the tank is typically the easiest role to play. You'll just be cycling your DPS rotation with your blocks because in "elitist" groups you're tanking in bare minimum toughness and squeezing out every drop of DPS you can get.
---
If that is the case, then more than 1 class needs to be able to pump out both alacrity + quickness. I was voting for healy rev when they added alacrity but it still has not gone anywhere near replacing MT chrono.
---
Wish they'd give us Aurene Branded versions of all the T3 cultural armor.
---
I know that stats are capped in lower level areas and dungeons, but is crit chance also capped? Or do traits that increase crit chance still work? For dragonhunter, does the retalaiation crit chance traits work in the lower level areas and dungeons?
---
Not anymore. Druid USED to be about heals, now it is about a boon, regen. Burst healing died; I came back to the game expecting to heal with my skills, I used to run a lazy staff/staff build and easily heal through everything. So by this logic, there is a duplex of just boons and dps.
---
Currently, the balance between dual chrono and fb/ren/chr or fb/ren/fb is quite solid. Speedclear groups actually favor FB/Ren/Chr on most bosses because you get *more* DPS out of that combination, oddly enough. If you add another class that slots in *directly* instead of a chrono, it'll either completely outclass chrono and we'll have the same problem "but now it's an engi instead of a mesmer~" or it'll be worse than chrono and everyone will keep whining about a meta they don't know things about.
---
Kormir's Library! I'd love to revisit this place more often
---
That's just to keep that_shaman busy and looking away from something else they don't want him to see.
---
The cap/reduction is fortunately only applied to pure stats so anything giving you +x% of crit chance (like the DH retal trait) will still work perfectly well in lower zones (which one of the reasons why DH is so good for the low level dungeons compared to basically any other class).
---
Yeah, the game is not balanceable partly due to the community. Look at something like FFXIV where literally every class is viable for content that 99.9% of players will play through. Some classes are not optimal for the insane difficulties, but most people will not do those anyway (Ultimate Coil).
---
That hair ... reminds me of  this: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/28/bf/a7/28bfa70c2e99e35ecf6223a266cb5b83.png
---
&gt;apply the huge amount of agony damage to you. 
---
Yeah except that they have been rather clear that Agony will not be the thing in the open world. Which makes total sense because if it was it would "force" people into grinding in order to access open world content which goes against the philosophy of the game.
---
I play with 250ms+ on NA sometimes, a lot of the time dodging in this game doesn't happen as an "oh shit" moment, almost everything you know it is coming before it happens. You just dodge earlier, you get used the timing.
---
It always takes a week or so to get used to it though if i take a break from it and just play on EU :)
---
A warrior solo breaks the bar and bursts the anomaly with the help of the DE in charge of that spawn. Works for our static. 
---
Fire helps definitely, but isn't needed.
---
Nearly 7 years and I never knew that...
---
What is this, Dot Jack G.U. ?
---
... Right. Pretty much any composition works for GW2 raids. The meta describes the most efficient way to get fast consistent kills. It's totally possible to kill any gw2 raid boss without quickness and alacrity at all.
---
How about instead of pointless avatars you revamp the crappy forums into something more bearable?
---
lol, it totally was. The loading bar and the circular minimap struck me as things they ported over from GW1 until they realized there were better ways of handing it.
---
Add paid race changes and be like wow👌🏻
---
I know it wasn't old LA, but if you want a core Tyria GH, That_shaman datamined what looks like a krytan GH map a long time ago. It was removed from the game tho :/ 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/52bxvm/what_ever_happened_to_the_krytan_guild_hall/
---
Anyway, I'm all in for way more GH diversity in the game ! (like we had on GW1, even I know it won't ever happen)
---
Like, in real life? Because you do know about the effing sound sliders, right?
---
You can actually tank on any class, but the reason I personally use Chrono (and I’m the main tank when I raid) is because it’s the easiest to use for boon sharing and other utility such as focus pulls at Samarog. In theory I could actually use Firebrand or even a Revenant tank, since I have them geared and ready to go. I can and do use these classes on some fights and survivability isn’t much of an issue, plus they still provide boon support. But Chrono remains the easiest to build a squad around.
---
A lot of this could have been avoided by not calling the movement LGBT, but something inclusive of everyone, promoting the message 'equal rights regardless of sexual orientation' instead of only naming specific orientations. ERROSO or whatever would be a nicer acronym. Fighting for tolerance *and* being inclusive is hard, but the only way.
---
Exactly.. it'll make choosing race a chore and will hurt existing characters if their buffs don't benefit their class
---
Thanks

Anet will likely never implement race changes. Why? Racial personal story and stuff. I don't think the game is built to have that stuff be changed like that.
---
There is a sword/pistol power holo build that uses one turret and may be considered a pretty strong build
---
Thank you for all your hard work and explenations on how you aproached building your tools.
---
Couldn't Mommy Glint just outright *tell* her "you are now Joko levels of immortal"? I also doubt whether the "overcoming her fear" part actually works when the opponent has an equal level of immortality (Kralk's claim was about Elder Dragons, not Aurene specifically).
---
Other than that you should be correct about her "death" having that effect, whether intentional or not.
---
The irony
---
First class to prove that wrong is condi renegade. Top dps can be achieved easily in groups with unevenly skilled players no matter your ping so idk what your point is there. 
---
Now in raids there are many factors to affect dps that will overshadow ping so it's never really a problem but there are cases where it can show such as on opening bursts on classes like DH.
---
100% you can top dps with 300 ping even in top groups if you are good enough but in vacuum situations, such as on the golem, the difference really shows.
---
Not all of those, I got half a dozen invisible mushroom spores on my main. Whether all character-bound drop unlocks happen to be from events I do not know.
---
You don not use the turret in this build. You just use the turret's toolbelt ability
---
I wouldn't just put it down to ping as there are often little mechanics in rotations that hugely affect dps.
---
I'd say that on the golem a 300 ping player can get within 95% of the benchmark on most rotations. Some maybe more maybe less.
---
How can you be proud on sexuality? It's as dumb as being proud on your nationality or your country. Both are things you are born with and not accomplishments. 
---
For example: While Putin is a great leader and is making Russia a great country again I am not proud to be a Russian because this is not my accomplishment.
---
Little more for condi dps. Like 5% depending on the build. Unimportant nevertheless.
---
So, I was expecting more changes to the song, because even if we did "bash" another dragon (2 actually since the last festival), Aurene is probably going to feel weirded out here...
---
The wiki page lays it out pretty well.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Expansion
---
Any character you see with that symbol is an employee who is currently repping the Anet guild
---
there's also way more faces scattered around the area in GW2, not just 4, and they vary in size
---
I always just assumed they were tormented druid spirits, seeing as the faces seem to be in agony and there's other petrified mosshearts around the place
---
But is the matriarch the local leader of the harpies or Dwayna as the patron of angels and harpies?
---
I don't like this idea. Darkness is the reason I literally HATE Ascalonian Catacumbs because I have to increase my gamma by 30-40, otherwise I can't see anything (usually I have 1.05 gamma in OW). It is not comfortable for me to have black screen and not knowing where I am. This could be good for small area, but not for a whole map.
---
&amp;#x200B;

Maybe just... map at night where you have to bear a special item, but not something like in Bitterforst Frontier - we could use an item that can be draw or stowed by special skill.

---
Repair SM walls. Solo hard work.
---
Thank you for your work. I would say calling the add on a 1000% boost at some spots not that useful of a metric as percentiles, even at the same spots. Many hardware reviewers use the 1st, 10th, 50th, 90th and 99th percentile to show the variance better. Well I know it can take a lot of effort to benchmark well so it's okay  as it is, but those stats tend to be more convincing.
---
it had a ton of meta builds in pve and was a very solid midline+flag runner in pvp. so yeah
---
What? ....

Transmuting one piece of true legendary(not ascended that works as it was legentrary) shoul cost 100 charges

My bad then. There where quite a lot of confusion in the squad doing it today about it.

i am just putting out here that in good groups:
---
- druids tank xera and deimps
---
- renegades tank dhuum
---
- before fmw! was abused firebrands tanked gorseval, kc etc.
---
that means chrono ends up tanking:
---
- vg (chrono is op here because of self green distort and the blur evading multiple its so blues dont port you - compared to an aegis that cant do so)
---
- soulless horror 
---
- largos
---
- qadim
---
This kind of works deserve support and donations.
---
what are you trying to accomplish?
---
Thank you for your hard work sir!
---
I am in a guild for the guild hall nodes and waypoint cost reduction, most other members of the guild are in other guilds so it’s always silent. I mainly play on Fri/Sat night WvW, if I miss the queue I log off. If I log in other times, it’s for dailies, metas, occasional fractal/dungeon, or occasional quest step (finished pof story about two weeks ago). Never tried raiding in gw2, but I was a hardcore raider in vanilla/bc wow (top10 world guilds). I find spvp boring as the games are too small, I would try it if it was 10v10 or (preferably) much bigger, and I have no interest in ranked.
---
I play mainly solo... and currently I'm focused on raids. Pug squads aren't so bad, yesterday we cleared W1, W2 and almost W4 (we ended after Samarog). If everyone knows what to do, that doesn;t matter if it's pug or guild squad.
---
I wish I could have some nice people to play with — do some dungeons in chill run (I hate rushing), some events, metas, hunt champions, bounties. I'm in 3 guilds, but it's even hard to find any help.
---
well i think [absorption sigils](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Sigil_of_Absorption) are not even tradeable. Anyways, they're a huge part of the current meta in Zergfights

What's the conversion recipe from one essence to another?

I should really cover this thing :-)

Well, it doesn't touch game code, it just intercepts dx9 calls and makes them dx12. So it's in the same bucket as reshade, etc.
---
Percentages and small numbers just break. Heh. Still even a few frames increase when you're in the teens is an improvement one can feel.

also, norn need to be re-branded to giant shapeshifting shamans. Instead of bigger dumber humans.

---
Fucking hell.
---
Bear and longbow.
---
You know, I feel like somewhere in the metatextual layers of this comment thread there's something to be learned about the nature of the actual topic at hand...
---
The funny thing is. For Gorseval it would make the fight harder if you have to do it the intended way. For a Gorse CM I would flat out remove the split phase there, make orbs spawn faster and ramp up their grow rate. The debuff should be dealt with otherwise it kills you and going down with the debuff also kills you. And yeah, some adjustments in enrage timer and HP.
---
Any intention on adding GW2Hook compatibility or are there technical reasons that prevent it?
---
Tbh, probably not. Would some people buy it? Sure.  Would it be profitable enough to spend dev time on working out the issues of racial armor and personal storyline?  Obviously not, or they would have rolled it out years ago.
---
Only if gw2 addon loader project will kick in.
---
Awesome community!
---
Now you guys will both be able to have some cool mounts!
---
To actually answer the question: Yes f2p players are on the same servers and such as paid/core accounts.
---
The f2p restrictions would be really annoying to deal with as a team because it’s things like getting in game mail (so you could share some gold/items) and chats and using the gemstore/trade post of which if she is anything like my wife.... hellloooooo fashion wars!
---
So that PoF code is going to make the experience you guys share just that much more fun! (And hey now you can wait for a sale on HoT and she can go full account if she wants too... get a cool glider and join some epic meta trains)
---
Anyway love this community and a hearty welcome out to your wife.

Boom-de-yah-da, boom-de-yah-da
---
And just think, the flack you for originally for not supplying uncompiled code. The way that was approached by certain people you were well in your right. To finish after 5 hours 😂 understand their concern but some of the comments were pure internet crap.
---
The main reason is probably that locking again whatever you unlocked is a pain for an usual personel on support. So they "sell it" as a comercial strategy to keep customers happy. Of course you can be sure that these kind of things are logged, so if anyone would want to play this trick on a general basis the response would be very different.
---
And what if i never raid? im fkd i guess :(

---
The only really used meta core profession is bs warrior, boon thief (handful encounters in raids) and condi engineer (very unforgiving rota). Your best bet would be playing guardian for fractals / raids. Power Dragonhunter is one of the top DPS specs for both. Power Firebrand (Quickbrand) paired with a Alacrene is meta in both raids and fractals and Heal Firebrand works well in Fractals.

Guild Wars 2: Don't Starve
---
The way approval works is Anet needs to be *very careful* what they approve. This project currently doesn't offer any sort of hack/bot/cheat system, but if Anet says "d12pxy is okay!" and megai2 maliciously then adds some sort of cheat or bot engine into the game, ArenaNet has caught itself in a catch-22 where players are using an Anet approved program that violates the user agreement.
---
If Anet instead said "d12pxy v1.0 is okay!" they'd need to re-audit and re-address every time megai2 updated the app. 
---
Instead of going down this wormhole of devs auditing the code or applying blind trust to community developers, they instead put the onus on the players to know what is and isn't safe. This hasn't always gone well: they once updated the game launcher to contain a process scanner to flag people for bans. The processes that flagged you for a permaban were almost all GW2 related programs that were only usable for botting or cheating in GW2, but they also flagged you for having [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/) running, which is used as a debug, TAS, and indeed cheat system for games. The reason this was bad, though, is Cheat Engine has a ton of legitimate uses: Nobody deserves to be banned from an MMO for cheating in single player games or running projects like the Dark Souls Randomizer (which has now been updated to be a standalone project, but was originally a set of tables for Cheat Engine).
---
If you aren’t claiming you play alone then wtf are you commenting for?
---
Guess you didn’t read the OP? (It’s okay common reddit mistake... next time let’s read before we comment)
---
This entire discussion is about people “claiming” to play gw2 “, which is open world mmo, “alone”.(some even claiming they play game modes like PvP... alone)
---
And I said... just because you pvp q solo doesn’t mean you are alone. The simple term PvP means there must be 2 or more players so... you (or they) are NOT playing the game.. alone.
---
Do us a favor.. Go back to your koolaid and don’t comment on posts you don’t actually understand.
---
Let grown folks speak

Guardian is a fun and more versatile option in my opinion as the firebrand is one of the best support class atm, search for quickbrand build, it explain a lot on how to use it, sorry i cant post it here atm since i'm using my phone, hope someone will post it later and give more explaination

You had enough time to do daily worldboss runs if you really wanted the ultra shiny skins.
---
I tried it out, and while it did boost FPS overall, I also noticed that it lead to some dramatic framedrops when loading into a new area with many players present. This was especially annoying when trying to join a dragonfall meta train. Unfortunately I had to uninstall it again.
---
I missed that end time. If I'd realized, I'd have done my rounds before then. I missed a whole day. What a strange time to end an event.
---
Just because his code has been shown to be fine now, does not invalidate the concerns that those people had. It only takes one hack to potentially lose your account, and if you can't verify the code, you have a responsibility to be very suspicious.
---
Save it by all means. Play as if karma didn't exist until you have 3-4 millions. 
---
Once you reach that point you should focus on maintaining those numbers as a minimum reserve. Later in the game you will find things that really need a lot of karma and then you will realize that being karma deprived is not fun.
---
Like I said - I didn't disagree with the concerns just how some people communicated them.
---
Fair enough
---
Updates are not to prevent “ranked” meta abuse..
---
They do PvP updates to stop meta abuses at AT/mAT level (nobody cares about ranked pip farm) or before tourney like the legends one or the 2v2 types.... which should hopefully be back by the end of the year so we will have a new set of “duo of destiny” titles.
---
Sooo no there won’t be PvP patch soon.. stop worrying
---
&gt; They could actually make this into a "thing" with all the racial items giving the same bonuses but requiring different materials to make.
---
That would still make it into an unfair advantage thing per race if only because of different market prices you're going to have per materials needed for essentially the same thing
---
Not everyone has time to be online so often

More ideas for Gorseval
---
* Increased health. Enough to force updraft usage.
---
* Eggs start from phase one. Remove their visual telegraphs.
---
* Orbs start from phase one, increase the spawn rate for the second phase, increase it even more for the last phase.
---
* Make the defiance bar harder to break during the BabyRage attack.
---
* Make a spirit spawn at set intervals from the furthest position from Gorseval in the arena, the spirit works exactly like the ones in the split phase as in if it reaches the boss it’s game over. And I like your split spirits can’t be immobilized.
---
Slothasor
---
* Add an immortal slubling that doesn’t attack but can be stunned from time to time and walks around the room eating the mushrooms closest to him.
---
* The poison floor reappears a bit faster.
---
* Each player can only eat a mushroom once.
---
* Increased health, as per default.
---
* Rest is the same.
---
The idea is to remove the idea of a fixed ideal path making players adapt or bait the big slubling and to force the player who gets to eat a mushroom to stagger and think about the path for a bit. It also makes the Volatile Poison more challenging to place.
---
This will eat ram. Only use on 16gb+ systems:

I made the mistake of thinking you were legitimately misunderstanding the situation. I should have guessed you were just posting to try and call people virtue signalers.
---
I comprehend what you’re trying to say, but you clearly can’t see past your own ego to see what others are. All you’re doing is trying to “find humor” in someone who posted something that was obviously going to be viewed negatively in the thread, while completely disregarding how it makes the people celebrating feel. Sure, maybe you see both perspectives but you certainly don’t respect one of them.
---
Your entire tone has been combative and rude the whole way through despite attempts to speak with you respectfully. I’m sorry you feel the need to be so insulting to everyone.
---
You litterally just said you should get rewards for not playing the game.
---
It’s not a viewpoint, it’s a fact. It doesn’t matter if you find it funny, it’s literally done to be an asshole to other people on the internet. This isn’t a “oh I don’t think it’s funny so it’s not acceptable moment.” 
---
I’m not sure if you’re new to the internet or just trying to be an asshole yourself, but given how rude you’ve been the entire time I’ll hazard the latter. Sorry that I thought you were anything but a troll.
---
tbh, if you want a more ballanced 1v1, you guys should play in sPvP. PvE ballance and items can make some classes rediculously overpowered. On the other hand on maps with lots of obstacles some builds become almost unplayable. That's why 1v1 is usually played in a plain, not so big area, this way endless kiting is somewhat weakend / harder to pull off, AoE spamm can still be "walked around" and projectile focussed builds can be viable.

Wish I could use this but every time I try it just causes so many crashes :(

Hey man, just wanted to thank you for all the hard work 🙏

This is super helpful to me, I have sensitive eyes and the usual unstable fps in game really stresses them. This tool makes playing much easier - so thank you!

Same with fractals. Even around NA reset fractal group in NA looks like dungeon lfg. Whilst in EU there is constantly new groups adding and a long list of choices. I never understood why but thought it was that NA had more static groups.
---
Quote me where I said that please.
---
I'm just trying to explain it might kinda suck for people who can't play often due to jobs etc. Or who don't do raids. Even if beginners can get the stuff, if you can only go online so often that puts a huge dent in your ability to show up to timed events like this and there is often little warning for when the event will stop if you miss out on the announcement.
---
This isn't even my case. I can play daily and didn't miss out but I'm just showing sympathy for those who now have a huge grind ahead of them
---
Funny cuz every random pleb that plays 2 hours in a weekend on their soldier necro feels entitled to every single thing the game has to offer.
---
I think it is unlikely for a new profession and there are several reasons for that.
---
For once, we currently have three professions for every armour type, light, medium and heavy. Adding a new one would bring that to an imbalance again (not that it matters much but the character creation screen would look worse again). Then you have the elite specs, a new profession would already need to add two new elite specs to the game and an additional one each time they add a new elite spec to the game. Which would mean from 9 you would go to 10 which takes more time and more balancing issues.
---
As far as Cantha goes, I don't know, it would be great to see the Jade Sea not being frozen anymore but there is so much more on the continent that might hold more and better mysteries for us to explore.
---
I think the first question we should need to answer is if we are done with the elder dragons. Primordus and Jormag are somehow dormant but still a threat, Bubbles is not really someone we have seen or heard anything about so he could also be or become a problem.
---
When you have time, hop on the GW2 Community Dev Discord server and join the d912pxy channel- we can help troubleshoot your issue.
---
ANet can't cater to every single edge case. sure, it sucks for people if they can't complete something, especially when that is due to factors outside of their control. however ANet also provided a very reasonable way to complete the collection outside of the dedicated event, so if people truly have the urge, they can go at it at their leisure.
---
as for the warning when events end... read the damn patch notes. in all my years playing - particularly - MMOs, i've never come across a community so reluctant to even do that. instead you will find dozens of people spamming chat being utterly surprised by changes, and frankly that is a pure player-issue, not an ANet-issue.

I am in NA, I think it's just need not NA culture to play with people they don't already know. Might be a trust thing idk. Reset fractal lfg is not that bad tho in NA, most of the time I was able to get a group. 
---
Of course that was back in Feb of 2019 when I played this game, if NA lfg continued to die, I wouldn't have been surprised.
---
Why no new profession?
---
Will this work on a Mac??
---
Balancing will always be a problem, but they can not skip forever not releasing a new profession.
---
Trolling is being deliberately offensive to rile someone up. Anyone who finds that funny isn’t “smart enough” to find it funny, they’re just equally offensive to get their own kicks off of it.
---
But I’m sure the good people over at the Pickle Rick convention or TheDonald wouldn’t mind enjoying a nice chat about how trolls are high class intelligent humor. 
---
You’ve been literally insulting people this entire thread. I have no responsibility to humor you and be respectful, I was only trying to give you the benefit of the doubt. Clearly I was wrong about it.
---
Go on and complain about being insulted (by being called out as a troll, which you don’t seem to think is bad thing but you now find it insulting?). Next time maybe try not being rude and offensive to others first, though, if you care so much about your internet points and about not being insulted back.
---
Have a good morning/afternoon/evening. I hope you see the error of your ways eventually. :)
---
&gt;Eggs start from phase one. Remove their visual telegraphs.
---
Stop right there. The point is to make the fight more challenging. What you propose here would make it more unpredictable and annoying. There's a huge difference. This is by-the-book bad design.
---
Ideally, CMs should introduce new mechanics or change the existing ones in a way that makes them more challenging, but still leaving the players the opportunity to master them. That's the whole point.
---
But, how would you train mechanically ? I understand the rewards would be one time, but still, after first kill in easy mode, you're far from mastering it.
---
If an easy mode comes one day, it should be permanently accessible (but with no rewards after).
---
tell me what a new profession can bring to a game what especs can't
---
There's most likely going to be a sale around the time of the anniversay (end of August) on the official site. DLGamer (a legit site) usually has discounts all year round though, might wanna check there :)
---
While I can agree with that I don't think we need more professions.
---
More professions bring exponential more work for the devs to add more and more elite specs each time a new one would come out and not only for the future but also retroactively. A new profession today would be one profession and two elite specs already.
---
I want to see more of the char areas around the top right of the map and custom home instances
---
I want Cantha so bad
---
We got him boys
---
Even if we don't get expansion level content, if there was another pet or two over the season that'd be great.
---
That's true...and irrelevant. It's the same thing with a new race, or new adventures. Some people like those things, and absolutely must have them. Every game has things that people really want that don't happen. Not everything can be put into every game. Those who absolutely need it will leave. Shrugs.
---
“If an easy mode comes one day, it should be permanently accessible (but with no rewards after).“
---
What he said!
---
the art style here actually reminds me of the Enda and Harvey series
---
I just want some little things:
---
* Nodeplacement in Home Instance
---
* Buildtemplate (i know its announced)
---
* Breaking up the locked Slots from 1-5 (Weaponslots)
---
* More Shared Inventory
---
* More Bank Slots
---
* Trading Post overhaul (far to slow, no third party support)
---
* A Story without Destiny 2.0
---
* Muting Character voice
---
* Map curriency exchange (Example: 20 Winterberries -&gt; 3 Geodes)
---
And yes, some of these things are way to much, its just the things i wish for.
---
While this is a nice idea for helping people get a first kill, I think a lot of people would just use it for an easy first kill then never touch raids again which doesn't really help the overall raid population.
---
I'll give you kudos on coming up with a unique idea, but I don't really know if it's any better than having an "easy" mote that buffs the whole party and negates (or heavily negates) any rewards. The main problem I see is it doesn't let you have a "teaching mode". So, what, you're new to raiding and you get to join a squad because of the buff but then you go through the boss and basically get carried and now hopefully you learned something because you'll never be able to do that again!?
---
Here's my pie-in-the-sky best-possible-but-never-going-to-happen way for Anet to make raids awesome: have a 4-tiered system like Fractals. Tier 1 is just current system but with player buffs but no LI/LD drops and reduced loot. Tier 2 is current system. Tier 3 is challenge mode for the raids with actually decent repeatable rewards. Tier 4 is fucking insane. Quickness and Alacrity do 100% of their respective effects and the bosses challenge your reaction time, your rotation and your internet speed. Anet would put out that T4 would only be for people crazy enough to try it and there would be no dedicated effort to make sure T4 raids are balanced, or even completable by a group of good players. Complaints on the forums to nerf T4 difficulty might very well incentivize Anet to increase the difficulty. And similar to Fractals, if you complete a boss at a certain tier during the week you get all lower tier rewards as well. Disregarding my T4 part, I really don't understand why Anet hasn't implemented the rest of the idea already.
---
Why not tier the encounter like fractals, but with the easy mode, so that more players van learn the raids
---
If lfg doesn’t search for Druid, you should never have a problem with joining as something else. At least in my experience. 
---
Ele Heal and FB always works and sometimes (in low LI groups) you can really safe the day as Scourge. 
---
Just have a Druid ready, if com ask for that, to be sure. Otherwise, play what spec you want (as long it gets the job done)
---
The biggest problem with GW2 raiding is CMs aren't repeatable. Having repeatable CMs won't split up the community if you can do both the CM and the normal mode each week. It would add way more to do in terms of raiding.
---
I'm so used to my setup with ArcDPS/Reshade/GW2Hook but I really want to check out d912pxy.
---
Has anyone else "sacrificed" gw2hook for this?
---
Do the pros of d912pxy outweigh the pros of gw2hook?
---
In Draconis Mons if you take the top/highest wp and just drop/glide down to the mid level to the left/west of the WP theres usually a few smokescales and 1 veteran smokescale prowling that kinda roadway at the edge: [http://prntscr.com/o6fll6](http://prntscr.com/o6fll6)  just above the entrance to the flax farm.
---
Its probably because the engine is the old gw1 engine, but modified, improving it means starting from scratch i guess and thats probably to expensive.
---
My main feature wish was, is and for always will be a bestiary (both for enemy creatures and for non-hostile npcs).
---
now it all makes sense. the reason people like that flock to this game is because the people creating this game make it for players like themselves
---
It's easier to see where you are as an asura, but Anet has said before that they are the same for all races. We could always do an experiment though!
---
Players have the feeling that elite specs are enough change of gameplay to not seek entirely new professions. And it preserves the game balance towards armor weights.
---
For example, I think specs like Scourge, Firebrand, Druid or Chronomancer are significantly distant from their core counterparts.
---
I'd personally like to see a lot more angelic themed skins to be honest. When you look at the wardrobe, there's way too many dark themed skins. We need variety for our characters!
---
Can't wait for the Cantha announcement
---
sounds good!
---
Can you elaborate, what does that mean?
---
O wow I love these. Good work :)
---
As you have a good knowledge about this I have a non related question. I don't use your lib just stock gw2. I have a very old cpu i7 3xxx but a gtx 1080 and run the game on 3440x1440. pretty ok fps between 25-60.
---
Sometimes I get very low fps around 10-15. When I then switch from fullscreen window to window and back I suddenly have 20-30fps more. Same when I run fullscreen and switch to windowed and back. It's reproduceable and works every time. So I often do it after map change if my fps are low. Any idea why this happend?
---
As I said it is not related to your lib. Maybe a lot of other players have this problem too.
---
Mugremoth, Zhaitankard, Pintmordus, Kralkatankard?
---
I think that it mostly depends on the boss an requirement. I mean by now almost everyone who raids a little has 300 li. Also a lot of times ppl use pug groups to experiment xD. But pugging isn’t to bad. At I usually find enough decent groups
---
The aegis share is a big part too. It's a big part of the Deimos fight and similar.
---
still waiting for a version that works with gw2hook.
---
That gonna be a big no from me dog.
---
As a person who raids on NA, I get it too well. :(
---
Just what I want after a Human specific expansion, is even more Human specific content!
---
last time this subject came up I suggested a fractal like system and I got shit on for even thinking about something like this. I still think such a system makes a lot of sense, would open up this unique content for a broader player base and thus would increase the interest for Anet to build more such content.
---
I hope the nay-sayers won't find this post and start their shit storm again.
---
It's it good to use with weak video card? I tried it the other day and didn't spot difference
---
They don't announce sales far in advance, it usually is on sale during an event in game (living world release, anniversary of the game).
---
New profession highly almost 0% unlikely especially in living world and I'll tell you for why if they introduce a new profession they need to make 2 elite pecs and if they introduce elite specs in season 5 they need to make 3 new elite specs for it.
---
Have you started doing end game raids and fractals? If not I suggest you learn the mechanics of the fight before you try to use an uncommon build. As well as practicing said build in fractals
---
I'm hoping that we get some hints today with Dragon Bash. Last Dragon Bash set up for Season 1, we very well could get the intro to Season 5.
---
If no [activation time](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Activation_time) is stated on the skill tool tip, then it's instant. There is no minimum casting time.
---
yeah its the same with many other games as well.
---
EU in general is more competitive while us mostly has a more casual approach.
---
This shows not just on the number of raid groups in lfg but also the runs being more serious and meta focused aswell.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I would love an actual tier system for raids. New players, static’s and guilds would have a way to train that way. But we all knew those people who would complain, if T2 groups want to see LI and stuff. And I bet they want to see them. Doesn’t matter if it makes sense or not. 
---
As long as there is a way to measure your experience in raids, lazy ass guys will have a hart time to get into it.
---
Also, since the Berserker changes, Warrior can't really tank all that well because it loses 300 toughness in Berserk.
---
Cantha I'd vastly prefer to be introduced via an expansion, rather than Living World.  Rather than a new profession (which would be nice, sure, but I see as basically impossible) I'd like for them to really embrace the "expansion-level" content delivery they keep promising with Living Story, and give us new elite specs.  
---
As far as what we actually do during LS5, it's hard for me to say, as War Eternal didn't leave us with too much. My prediction for episode 1 though, is that we go to the Blood Legion homelands, to investigate Kralkatorrik's resting place, and deal with some Charr issues.  I kinda hope LS5 follows a similar arc to LS3, where dragon issues, while still present, take a bit of a backseat to more domestic concerns, but whereas LS3 focused on humans, LS5 would focus on Charr.
---
Just because you're a human doesn't invalidate that you're unintelligent.
---
These "hopes for season 5" posts depress me because you just know OP's going to leave the game because they think they're getting the moon and a pony with every patch. Same with the weekly Tuesday "oh boy I can't wait for the balance patch"
---
Seriously. We might go to Cantha if they think they can do it, but a new profession? Dude, the studio lost 1/3rd of the staff and they weren't even sure there'd BE a Guild Wars 2 after Season 4. I'll consider us lucky to get road sign repair quests. The game's content is fantastic now, but they need time to get the content pipeline going.
---
That's clearly an attempt at Goku's clothing
---
EU in general is more competitive and open to criticism while US mostly has a more casual approach.
---
Tbh the only thing distort has over FB aegis it that it still distorts yourself making it very strong on VG, but apart from that yes. There is absolutely no reason to nerf chrono because it tanks everywhere, previously warrior was used to tank on dhuum thats how trivial tanking is, people act like its an actual job but its barely more than a nuissance.
---
So from my understanding pugs will be categorizing supports like this:  
---
Support + Dps = quickness firebrand , Alarcity  Renegade, Boon Tempest  and maybe Banner Warrior?
---
Offheal = Healer Firebrand , Healer Scourge and Healer Tempest
---
Support + Tank = Chrono Support
---
Healer + Support = Healer Druid
---
Chrono and Druid cannot be replaced in its effectiveness? (only thing closer to druid being Heal Firebrand)
---
Is this how it is?
---
So what would be the closest builds to replace a chrono tank and a druid healer?
---
There should be a "Gw2's tools" sticky on the sub and this should lead the list.
---
Poor Lancer.
---
Beards! Where are the goddamn asura/charr/sylvari beards!
---
As long as it is mostly flavor, I am all for it.  
---
Then again stuff like, lets say T4 cultural armor, sounds like alot of work. Maybe something for the next expansion? Perhaps some racial underwater gear if thats the direction we're headed?  
---
On the other hand, people like to have options. I can totally see how some human players wanted to go with a norn theme but were unable to use the norn cultural armor or vice versa.  
---
So the question remains why we would want the devs to put work into making stuff that is *unavailable* to 4/5th of the races.
---
My ideas:
---
Vale Guardian
---
* Seekers can no longer be affected by CC, soft or hard.
---
* The 'activated' segments of the arena tick more damage and rotate faster from the second phase, and start at the first split phase instead of the second DPS phase. 
---
* The split phase adds heal back up to full if not CCd in time, and their damage aura grows the longer they are alive. 
---
* The split phase adds get buffs if their corresponding segment of the arena is activated.
---
* Blues constantly spawn underneath players' feet while VG's defiance bar is up. 
---
* The split-phase adds will appear during the final phase and must be killed again before VG can be killed.
---
Gorseval
---
* ~~Gorseval gets an ability called 'Morseval' which spawns tiny gorsevals named 'Gorsemal'~~
---
* Charged Souls spawn during the DPS phases, instead of just the split phases, and must be dealt with. 
---
* Existing orbs give both Gorseval and his adds a damage buff, similarly to how they give players a debuff.
---
* Downed players spawn a spirit. 
---
Sabetha
---
* The flame wall rotates significantly faster. (I feel this alone would kill *a lot* of people)
---
* Cannons appear faster, requiring 4 dedicated cannon people instead of 2. 
---
* Timed bomb instantly kills others caught in it, and instead of doubling at 50%, now doubles at 75%, increased to 3 people at 50%, and finally 4 at 25%. 
---
* Kernan will do much more damage. 
---
* Knuckles will do his knockback much more frequently.
---
* Karde will perform a flame wall similar to Sabetha.
---
* Bandit adds will spawn more frequently.
---
Matthias:
---
* Matthias will begin converting his conditions to boons if Blood Shield is active for longer than 5 seconds.
---
* Ghosts are active from the start, 2 at first, doubling when the 2 ghosts would normally spawn.
---
* Matthias gains stacks of Blood Fueled the longer he is alive in the Abomination phase, 1 every 30 seconds. 
---
* Sacrificed players are quicker to die, and require more CC. 
---
Xera could probably do with one, she's one of the very few bosses without any CM or achievement that isn't just to kill the boss.
---
Thanks, will give it a try!
---
It isn't that raiders don't want new raiders.  Most don't want new players to get handed everything on a silver platter without effort.  In addition, the number of new players/shitty experienced ones that pug and fake kp to try and get carried when it's obvious they are complete trash is increasing.  I don't mind helping new players, but lying and wasting people's time isn't the way to go.
---
In addition, there are numerous discords and training groups people can join to get into raids.  Most players seem to want to be full clearing without any effort and whine and complain that they don't have the time to dedicate to it.  That is part of raiding, is learning and spending time getting good at encounters and your class.
---
Lastly, I am not against easy modes or anything, but I am not fully convinced they will do much.  We had that Snowman raid awhile back and the number of non raiders who joined in pugs on random classes without any attempt at being decent and then complaining with a wipe was astounding.  The issue isn't difficulty, because that "raid" was easy as shit.  The issue is people don't want to change ANYTHING about their class or build and then want to go in without any idea about what they are doing and faceroll stuff.
---
You realize you would see that this "abuse" happened in the logs through the buff and make it invalid that way. 
---
Problem with doing it raid wide is you have to find 9 others in the same situation as you, and that's so hard that you would not do it most likely.
---
But your take is okay too, I thought about that too in the past and it's the obvious choice.
---
Well I get kinda stomped too, so that's just normal I guess :)
---
Ah fuck, wish I would have waited.  I was wondering how expensive they would be so in case they were like 100gaything + 2g or something I just did the bosses.  Rip.
---
Should we never do festivals either incase people can't log in during that 3 week window as well?
---
Use the Candy Corn Gobbler as well to add another 50% wvw xp.  This helps you move your reward track gains faster as well.
---
I would ask why people even think Straight Pride is a thing...then I remember that trolling is so prevalent in this game that they've caused RPers to be hesitant to go out into the world.
---
Meh, I got some weird texture glitches unfortunately. Might have to go through the troubleshooting to find out whats wrong.
---
full ascended from loot and shards.... hmmm
---
The previous version I tried using made everything render in super slow, and reduced my frame rate to less than 10 (from 40-50).
---
I know there's a lot of people who dislike each race having differences beyond the aesthetics, just like everyone hated even hearing about mounts before PoF, but I think racial customization is the next big step in the franchise.
---
* ArenaNet needs to make money. New playable races are the next step, but the problem is that they would feel like aesthetic-only upgrades, since GW2 gives you no reason to have multiple characters from the same profession. This means each race needs to be distinct enough, so you're encouraged to make new characters.
---
* Give each race its own series of masteries, which would include both aesthetic and gameplay upgrades. These new racial masteries would replace racial skills, and include things like a customizable golem suit for the asura, and revamped spirit forms for the norn. They wouldn't impact profession gameplay, and focus mostly on utility and open world interaction.
---
* New races can now be introduced safely, and players will be encouraged to have at least one character of each race, aside from one character of each profession.
---
* This might still not be enough to increase character value. The solution? Let you carry multiple characters at once, and easily swap between them. Only one character would be out at a time, just like now, but this new option would let you swap without relogging to the character selection screen. A total of three per character group sounds like a good compromise.
---
* You would be able to customize your character groups through the character selection screen. This opens the way for more complex profession customization, since it's no longer the build of a single character, but two more which you can swap to easily.
---
* This character group mechanic would have restrictions depending on the game mode, and the character swapping itself would have a series of limitations as well.
---
I think this is the future. Whether ArenaNet has the same ideas or not, well, time will tell.
---
&gt;Actually Aurene's first trial was experiencing her champion's death. She was so scared to die, because of us, because she knew that would hurt the commander, as she hurt...
---
And yet, clearly the lesson Aurene came away with after the commander came back from the dead and then SHE came back from the dead was not one of learning to come to terms with death and acceptance, but one of denial. Surely, she shouldn't worry about death anymore because both her and the commander will just come back if they die so no big deal.
---
RESOLVED. The third time I tried the instance, the VERY FIRST HIT sank the ship, it was aligned exactly the same, I shot with exactly the same amount of force. I have no idea why it worked this time, but yay!
---
If they ever show interest in making a new weapon I think there's a good chance that we'll get Spear as a land weapon. They've already been doing some animations with them on NPC's (such as Sunspears and Divinity's Reach Guards in Lake Doric), there's already a good catalog of weapon skins they can just reuse (including Gemstore skins), and there's a lot of interest in them as weapons (from both current players and people interested/curious about GW2).
---
It just all depends if new weapons are niche they feel like dabbling in.
---
arcdps and d912pxy work fine together.  install d912pxy as the \_chainload.dll and arcdps as normal and things work peachy
---
Not saying its fast, but its certainly possible, ofc at a slower rate than actual raids (like fractal 2 vs 4)
---
This is really neat!
---
I have been doing so research on DX12 over the last year for my dissertation, which DX12 features did you use most? My dissertation focused on async compute, I'm wondering if you used it in this project at all? I would understand if you didn't, I'm not sure how much access you have to compute shaders with GW2. 
---
If you don't mind me asking, how do the test results change in regards to different GPU architectures? In my experience, DX12 specific features only function well on more modern GPUs (Pascal or later for Nvidia).
---
Clean d912pxy install would be best.
---
Maybe they should finish the current cycles of racial skins before they start making new ones. Both Sylvari and Asura only have 2 tiers of racial skins.
---
&gt; The transmutation system is not healthy for profit,
---
I believe that's why they eventually moved from charges being scarce to them being very easily obtainable.
---
WvW is badly ballanced for 1v1 as well. I can assure you, if you like to solo roam or small scale roam, go play sPvP. It's a much more condenced version of what's really fun about roaming around in WvW.
---
Especially since the warclaw implementation. Now people who don't rly want to fight don't have to. They'll just ride off and leave you suffer in your unfullfiöled needs.
---
I do know the sadisfaction in a random intense 1v1 in WvW is the best feeling in the whole game, but again: I got these encounters in sPvP as well. Sometimes I even recognize the "awesome 1v1 dude" from a previous game and rechallange him.
---
If you don't hunt sPvP for the unique loot nor strave for high ranks, but just enjoy it for what it is, it's literally the best place for small scale PvP fun.
---
And now that Anet is hiring new sPvP and WvW devs my hopes rise again for dedicated GvG scrim content and more updates for sPvP as well.
---
Yeah, but in case of lava font they could make aftercast be an actual skill cast.
---
0 sec cast time would mean that you can cast it while casting other skills, but lava font doesn't work like that.
---
The "toxicity" is a consequence of the lazyness of some people that refuse to follow basic instruction. No wonder those "toxic elitists" ask for kp even on easy wings, since most of the time your average pug lacks to capacity to even autoattack.
---
If 'Get to the choppa' doesn't shout out when you summon it, there will be tears.
---
Before they do any new racial additions, they should finish the tiers of Asura and Sylvari racial weapons. Neither of them have a T2 skin.
---
Have you ever healed with a core ranger or a core necro?
---
its megAi2 not megUi2
---
Oops
---
What you do better than me is not going to blame anybody in your suggestion. I kinda lost my mind and was dumb enough to blame "raid elitists" - my term for the toxic part of the raid community - for keeping a lot of potentially interrested gw2 players from ever touching this content (again).
---
And you can be sure the ones that heard this call answered with the fury of a thousand "raid elitists". After all they know the perfect rotation on these kind of encounters and are perfectly built for them. :'D
---
What's amazing is that you think I'd be interested in playing 15 flavors of wizard.
---
&gt; buy the container from trading post.
---
the drop rate seems pretty bad though
---
Quick swapping for stuff like skips. Power holo becoming perma superspeed scrapper in less than a second to zoom through shit then instantly going back to power holo before a fight kind of things.
---
Both? both?...Both!
---
Radial, arcdps and this now works perfectly. **I love you!**
---
Is the 100 chest limit for Dragonfall per account forever, or is it per day?
---
Thanks for the info.
---
DL Gamer currently has PoF for 33% off (-$10), if that’s good enough of a start for you
---
You craft when you have to, nobody really wants to if they don't have to. Why make some particular ascended gear useless while they can still make players happy when they get it as loot. Just saying, but that doesn't seem like a bad idea at all o.0
---
I've been wanting a Charr... something-machine since the concept of mounts were announced. The Beetle does seem perfect for it, doesn't it?
---
Yeah, I think that'd work! Maybe one of each color to represent how she gets the Blessing of the Five at the Gate of Madness in order to do it at all?
---
seems rather unnecessary tbh. sets and individual pieces are quite easy to get. depending on the potential implementation this would also require 4-6 recipes per slot, as they all have different values/stats/raw material costs/drop chances, meaning each cross-conversion would require a balanced cost, that is also in no way exploitable. this isn't necessarily hard, but it's tedious, and prone to cause confusion.
---
So around 2 months for the next one :)
---
Of all the suggestions for adding new weapon types to Guild Wars 2, adding the ability for spears and tridents to be used on land is the only one I see as having more than a 0% of actually happening, because the skins are already there, and they can probably (hopefully) reuse at least some of the animations. I still think it's pretty slim though, but it would be cool.
---
some of them, sure.  but way too many focus skins would look ridiculous as melee weapons.
---
uhh we've been to new locations A LOT lmao, that's a ridiculous claim. Just because the last expansion was in Elona doesn't we've never been to somewhere new, just take a look at [https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/guide/?v=4&amp;x=-811&amp;y=938&amp;z=0](https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/guide/?v=4&amp;x=-811&amp;y=938&amp;z=0)
---
Yes.
---
The limit I mention is per account, per day.  
---
There is another hidden mechanic to them though, where if you open 1000 chests without getting one of the unique ascended weapons, then you get one guaranteed. That guarantee only applies once per account, forever.
---
what is the point if death if you will continue life in the mists. death has no meaning in this game
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/99sl2e/report\_and\_photos\_from\_the\_community\_meet\_greet/e4q3yw8/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/99sl2e/report_and_photos_from_the_community_meet_greet/e4q3yw8/)
---
They also mention about Underwater Mount.
---
yeah the droprate seems abysmall, but doesn't mean that ultra shiny can't be achieved
---
I laughed more than it should.
---
We already have the MistLock Sanctuary which is literally out floating in space (not on the map), so I don't see why we couldn't have a guild hall or even a VIP area for a Mists version of Old LA. I'd pay to access that VIP area for sure.
---
Maybe this build doesn’t replace a chrono but instead a healer and doubles as a tank and healer, then bring in a support chrono. You haven’t gotten rid of those buffs, you’ve just combined the healer and tank and added a support chrono, which ultimately also doesn’t decrease your DPS slots. Maybe the chrono can even get off a higher dps then?
---
lmao thinking anet balances at all based on anything going on pvp
---
rev is still basically untouched after 9 months of destroying ATs
---
This, my bf recommended maybe the Warrior using Focus as a "fist" weapon for a Dancer Elite Spec with an evasion/riposte playstyle, and Confusion as an added condition.
---
You can use reshade or nvidia freestyle instead of gw2hook
---
then they wont bother doing it cuz most of them just want that shiny reward or that sweet AP
---
Go Guardian, especially for fractals. While hybrid Quickbrand, focusing on boons and dps over healing, is the meta pick for fractals, I doubt most groups would shun you for playing a Harrier Firebrand instead, so long as you keep providing 100% Quickness uptime. Firebrand can dish out a huge number of heals, and by running full Harriers, you can keep good uptime on a number of boons besides just Quickness, retal, and Fury.
---
I agree. My bank is full of stuff that i currently have no need for.
---
I think the best solution would be to make it upon salvage give currency from the content it dropped from like raids does it.
---
It is sarcasm bro
---
ANet balancing has been slowly moving towards stat-based approaches for these types of traits too :(
---
doing some raid(could just be training runs) would probably be faster and cheaper
---
Fractals are on a fixed cycle, so you should be able to plan ahead and check which days actually have the fractal you want.
---
At least they are stackable now
---
Well brand new piece costs like 40g so you better just craft new piece and keep old piece :)
---
Loot should be appreciated as much as it can.. Crafting sure is a nice game element, but definitely ain't the main focus here. It is actually using the stuff &gt;.&lt;" It won't lose any meaning as it will still be used whenever needed, sure sure some players will try to farm more to get the loot they so desire. But in that way it seems more like taking sides here on who likes crafting more than defeating enemies :p I don't necesserily dislike crafting, but it should'nt frustrate those that preferably do other things with their time.
---
That would kill an important part of the craft and its income from TP. 
---
I vote: No.
---
I just want a way to experience the raid story without having to find a group. I'd also be fine with it if they made an infantile mode so we could easily complete it with 9 randoms. There doesn't even need to be any achievements or rewards for this.
---
Buffs are a big 'No' from me. This game is free of min-maxing and I am very happy about that. Skins, especially mount skins, I can definitely get behind. It would be awesome for for Sylvari to be able to ride a [Mordrem Guard Mount](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mordrem_Guard_Mount).
---
Oh First! I miss playing alongside her in WvW! She'd suddenly appear to help take a Keep, then go spar with some enemy players 1v1!
---
&gt;According to his Patreon, he currently has one patron, paying him $4/month
---
Not anymore.
---
Thx u/megai2, here are my $5/mo
---
Anyone else using the Nvidia GForce Experience to add filters (Details in my case) having problems?
---
My fps drop to 11-20 and the screen flickers.
---
Disabling and restarting the game fixes it. But if I try to apply the filter again my fps drop and the flicker returns.
---
Otherwise the game runs so smoothly now :o
---
remove d912pxy folder and bin64/d3d9.dll

---
&gt;### Bug Fixes
---
&gt;- Fixed an issue that caused Deep Lilac Dye to appear twice in the preview for the Mad King Dye Kit.
---
river can be solo'd by watching some videos, statues are not hard at all so yeah, probably way more efficient.
---
Summary of what everyone has said:
---
\-Choose same server if youd be interested in WvW later on( not necesarry for regular play)
---
\- Be from same world region( NA servers vs EU servers)
---
\-  Party up and do any open world content you want. ( If on same map and cant see friend from party menu just right click his portrait and choose " Join in..." just means u guys  ended in different  versions of same map due to " high population on map"
---
\- For story, Progress is individual due to story choices BUT as long as you in party you can help each other on  your respective story missions no problem.
---
\- Dungeons and the like and later expansions/ living world story is possible to complete together since depends less on personal choices.
---
\- Race, Class etc etc wont affect your play with friends so go crazy, have fun. Play what u like how you like it!
---
The value doesn't seem to be changed? Just because some things are useless atm, does not mean that they originally intended to be that way. A ascended chestplate is worth exactly how much that chestplate is worth, should'nt be about any other factors. Whatever you decide to do with that is your business. Crafting will still be relevant to those that want to do it. It already is quite a tedious game element if I would say so, but for those that like doing it will obviously keep doing it as much as they want.
---
&gt;Increased the limit on the number of musical notes that can be played per second on all musical instruments before their skills are forced to cooldown. 
---
I MAY FINALLY BE ABLE TO DOOT
---
Most focus don't even look like they could be used in actual melee combat, so I don't know about that.
---
I feel as though if they added an entirely new class, you'd have complaints from all sides.
---
"It has n-2 Elite Specs while every other class gets n!"
---
"Why are there now 3 Medium Armor classes? My Legendary Armor is Heavy so now I'm at a DiSaDvAnTaGe!"
---
"Wtf I had exactly 9 character slots, one for each class. They expect me to BuY aNoThEr OnE!?"
---
"Anet didn't think this through...this is clearly a rip-off of the *insert 3 completely different classes here*, see it even uses *insert 3 secondary-at-best features of previously listed classes here*!"
---
Highlights:
---
&gt;Festival Tokens from Festival of the Four Winds can now be stored in the wallet. Existing Tokens can be consumed to move them to the wallet.
---
if this was necessary at all, it would have a close to nonexistent priority. you get so many different currencies thrown your way with which you can just buy what you need. and stats are relevant in that e.g. a chest has far more of them than e.g. boots. costs and drop chances just emphasise that more. having e.g. glove to shoulder conversions cost the same as chest to shoulder conversions will make a rather odd impression. your suggestion requires many more angles to be considered than you seem to realise, and i have yet so see a substantial argument that speaks for the necessity.
---
Yes, both.
---
we wont get largos as a playable race because as someone already mentioned, the only thing going for them is their mysterious, lone-wolf (usually), hunter nature. DR and LA will be infested with edgy and rainbow largos &amp; they'll lose their wonder. 
---
a new playable race would be awesome, but they can't have drastic proportions like wings or centaur legs.
---
They should remove charges altogether. Most people don't bother changing their appearance "because charges", even if they have hundreds of them.
---
&gt;Updated rewards in Dragonfall's Mistborn Coffers to give a broader variety of items.
---
Smells like a nerf that they don't wanna admit.
---
about time, lol
---
I know ppl feeling that 10 FPS is enough.
---
damn, no exalted shoulders on the statuette vendor? :(
---
finally
---
That sure sums it up well x)
---
Huh, didn't that article say we were also getting skyscale skins?
---
Never
---
I'm interesting in finding a new class - I'm a returning player that never really got to end game but did get to level cap.
---
I'm bad at learning hard or long winded rotations or ones that require a lot of switching but I also don't want one that's ***completely*** brain dead.
---
I was recommended to look for a class/build here...  [https://snowcrows.com/](https://snowcrows.com/)  but all of these seem absolutely complicated and hard to do for me.
---
Well, your question was about the pillar problem, if you have problems to fight the bunker in general, you may think about an other tactic/build/class.
---
i was hoping for them too... been ages since they've been available
---
&gt; Festival Tokens from Festival of the Four Winds can now be stored in the wallet. Existing Tokens can be consumed to move them to the wallet.
---
Best part of this patch for me, my inventory space is free!
---
&gt; The Branded Relic Package returns as an uncommon drop for the duration of this chest.
---
What? It was already in the last chest.
---
There was no set time specified, which probably means we gotta wait til next week.
---
Update is ~500MB.
---
Patch size: 501 MB
---
probably next week, they don't release everything in gemstore at once
---
I see some people say we might be going further into the Far Shiverpeaks to the North. I'd be okay with Hoelbrak getting some visual updates/love, and getting some more wintry maps while we're at it!
---
I have a app in my phone that is designed for making art with a phone, tablet or pc. Autodesk Sketchbook. So I finger draw all you see in picture. :) 
---
It's free to use.
---
Yes, that's what "returns" means.
---
Probably will be next week. When ANet does a update they usually have some stuff in the game that releases like a week later. They got the Skyscale horns right, so I don't see why they wouldn't be right about the Skyscale skins too.
---
I assume that we're getting them next week instead?
---
I guess we won't know for sure until that\_shaman works his datamining magic.
---
[Déjà vu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6dvGRLMRTM)
---
Sounds like fun design. ^^
---
maybe you installed release_d version by accident?
---
This post was partially inspired by that haha
---
Okay, that's not fair. When does it come in then?
---
Any card that supports DX11 supports DX12 by default, there is a small element of backwards compatibility.
---
However, certain features won't function at all on older GPUs. Some DX12 features rely on specific hardware, such as async compute. As a result, Nvidia GPUs built with the Maxwell or earlier architecture don't see many DX12 benefits compared to DX11, while Pascal and later GPUs tend to see massive benefits.
---
and not the fact that they have good bodies and probably pretty faces thus could make for extremely great super babe fashion war characters?
---
those wings might not even be part of their bodies
---
Same for me, bought all bioluminescent skins and got nothing. Since the last weapon skins (Branded) had their collection i'm guessing they'll add it soon?
---
Limits?
---
Making it worth so much less when you don't need it because you already had that gear type on whatever amount of characters with whatever stats, still is a problem. It isn't even guaranteed to give you anything to sell, sure it can but who says it will. Such a shame when you get it and already know how not lucky it actually is haha XD but okay whatever that is just how it is, I guess
---
 dd staff is my go to (no rotation, more enjoyment for me). I just want it to be usable on any raid boss. For some reason, groups only allow condi classes or ranged for certain raids and I do not care for either of those.
---
For me it's working fine most of time. I get problems only when i put it to livestream/shadow record/record mode and alt tab.
---
It's a new chest, and that item is something that's returning.
---
&gt; Unused versions of the Glyph of the Herbalist and Glyph of Volatility are available as rare drops for the duration of this chest.
---
Good time to grab Volatility for less, usually in the first few days while people are opening many Black Lion Chests.
---
I'm using [this build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vRAQRArf7YnM0AN9iV2Au1As3glgBLKpFAKXTRtdQOQ/u2XDsA-jRDBQBeU5US2fgmKB9hKKMUlgn9EAghWADqKBAOJAgRJj90I4PdB/QNgAAIA7M6MAfXmpyk5MnZA-e),  which is just a variation of Condi Minion Master solo build from Metabattle (do not pay much attention to equipment tab - it just reflects what my toon currently wearing and is not quite optimal, although should give some idea what to look for).
---
Took 53 keys to get thew new back piece. It's really long and pairs with Xiuquatl perfectly.
---
Well you can't farm a weekly limited thing so....it's more like an addition option to make that maps grind a little easier.
---
And still no fucking balance patch.
---
Metabattle is down for me and you bring up something I dislike from relearning and researching Guild Wars 2 - I just can't keep a build when I do Dungeons, Fractals, and Raids - apparently I have to switch out full sets to learn another rotation and style and I'm horrible at remembering one rotation let alone multiple.
---
I want to find a Class and Rotation I can enjoy and actually enjoy the games content but everytime I try and research and learn I keep taking another stepback due to the absurd learning curve
---
Probably a one-time thing to help those along that still are struggling with the Skyscale collection.
---
Like a few maps? No new regions.
---
Outside of the seldom moments I particiapte in Open World group events, I'm exclusively playing solo for the story, or in case of new elite specs, playing to test the new stuff. I had, for example, in HoT's AB the lone roaming Vinetooth-esque enemy around Tarir as my "test subject", and for PoF the mini event where you need to defend the farmers with the NPCs near Amnoon. Luckily, my measly sub-100 gold were enough for cheap exotic gear (mostly without additional, fitting runes/sigil) for most if not all my characters \*lol\*.
---
Apparently the new Black Lion Claim Ticket weapons, the Bioluminescent, has no collection associated with it and gives no AP and no 7 Tickets for getting all of them
---
Nope. Predicting mid-July, when festival ends.
---
That’s clever.
---
mt things can be usefull for smothness on i7 4790k
---
pso precompile should be used carefully, in collect and use style on any ram/vram
---
this is config i used for tests https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/545164738288418816/583364425847799818/config.ini
---
I also have that app installed on my note 8 🙂 I'm more impressed that you did this with your finger!
---
BREAKING NEWS: 4th tier upgrade of mini skyscale turns into poobadoo.
---
Not mentioned in the patchnotes, but you can swap Legendary Insights to Legendary Diviniations again! Be warned: It still has the original cap of +/- 160.
---
huh, jorbreakers are 15g on the TP at the moment, not 40.
---
When I started GW2 I wanted an Asuran Necromancer who also summons Golems. Too bad the golems you can summon suck. Still understandable can't make the golems too strong.
---
Yea super annoying. If you dont wanna give me tickets, fine, But atleast put collections so i can see what i need easily.
---
Still no WvW/sPvP, see y'all again next patch on "Will I play this game again?"
---
That's... extreme.
---
So, this is a common mechanic is some other games where the solution is, you stack, as soon as you see the attack that precedes it, everyone moves out. Is that too hard to figure out? Are the raiders in this game this much of babies that they can’t dodge an aoe without an orange marker telling them where the aoe will be?
---
I mean, it's one of the best farms in the game atm.
---
Balance patch will arrive eventually and you'll bitch regardless.
---
Missed opportunity for new dragon themed treats: Mordremalt Balls and Kralkatorrlick Lollipops.
---
Instead  
---
&gt; Elixir Gun—Fumigate: Fixed a bug that caused this skill to cleanse conditions from allies at a range of 600 while attacking at a range of 450. It will now attack enemies and cleanse allies at a range of 600. Cleaned up the visual effect to better line up with the increased attack range.
---
To which my only comment is "lol"
---
Nice ones. Few additions :
---
Gorseval : caged players are locked up for the rest of the fight or at least require a much tougher mechanic to get free. 
---
Sabetha : damage to the platforms actually creates holes in the floor that you can fall into. 
---
KC: adds keep spawning during the guitar hero phase, and move faster. The small adds running around attack you or explode if not killed in a set amount of time. Require 3 (or 4) add killed in order to CC (then I may find out what is up with that colored event that I have always skipped so far). 
---
Xera: all of the red-ish zones tick huge damage in addition to the debuff. The orbs coming from mid are more numerous and cause insta down. Also more frequent CC or a tight timer on it maybe.
---
This is where I farmed for the drop.  You can get there without the meta too and the smokescales will still be there.  It just took a long time.  The drop rate is pretty low.
---
Got any picture of them??
---
The patch is up. Congrats on getting filthy rich.
---
Anet promoting the various Raid Training communities would be a better path. A third of the bosses need nothing but a competent friendly commander, a run down on what will happen and new comers who did prepare gear and bear bone rotations.
---
Its not hard to get into those communities, just hard to find them if you don't know what you are looking for.
---
I actually find that groups on NA very rarely ask for kp, and even more rarely actually enforce a kp check on join. Most of the groups I see say something silly like "ping your current leggings" so they can at least tell you're running ascended with proper stats, but nothing extreme like 500LI or 200+ kp or whatever. In NA, people just don't pug as much. Statics often have extreme requirements, but that's because joining a static for a weekly full clear of every wing is a greater commitment than doing 1 boss or 1 wing 1 time.
---
first of all, it was never viable
---
turrets were hardly nerfed, they were never good to begin with
---
some of them see use such as rifle, thumper, heal..but a full turret build is a farm/afk build that's good at what it does(tagging) and nothing else
---
nice attitude btw, a real winner!
---
Lancer is my favourite servant 🙌🏻
---
Silly, but very well done. I like it!
---
Still at best completing a collection gave you half of the tickets for the next collection, basically diminishing returns.
---
Since the source of them is still from keys I don't see too much of an issue anyways.
---
All games and events are indicated with either a red dragon logo or the standard white/yellow adventure logo.
---
Didn't go for the trinket because of the meteor farming. Looks like my next one.
---
Judging by all the excuses the other replies are coming up with, clearly players are fine the way it is -_-
---
&gt;  this is basically 40 gold for 50 currency
---
What? I can't see the update page because I'm at work right now... but seriously. 40g for 50 currency? Seems extremly expensive no?
---
Where we droppin’ boys?
---
Mmm good old wall repair.  Keeps your participation up too when you're feeling lazy.
---
THANK YOUUUU SO MUCH ARENANET!!! This means so much to the music community. I never thought this would be fixed. You have my wholehearted thanks!!
---
Each of them can be purchased one time per week. So buying just a single one won't lock out the rest from being bought for the week, all of them are available.
---
What

the

#FUCK
---
Power soulbeast
---
I've legitimately got so much extra footage I pulled, I'm looking for songs to make more videos to now. &gt;\_&gt;
---
The char have tanks, there is giant flying airships. Yet people feel "my immmersion" when it comes to a roller beetle skin. Weird
---
How about cleaning/reusing core maps. Living World season one changes could finally go away like the Scarlet’s probes,the Marionette in Lornar’s (I think), the nightmare tower debris in Kessex Hills along with the toxic fish, the mordrem in the Ascalonian maps, the awakened in the Orr maps.  For story purposes they can do it like the personal story in old LA. Reverting back to old enemies (in the case of earlier maps like Kessex) or introducing new enemies would be great. Orr could have Corsairs trying to take over and unchained awakened can also be added. I love the Dragonsfall meta where we have to take the waypoints to specific locations is great and could be what the original Orr maps could have been like when the Pact was advancing on Zhaitan.
---
Ty!
---
Well this is disappointing to say the least.
---
I'll just stick with the Shimmerwing then. No need for another skin if I'm going to get burdened with two bland pattern-swaps too.
---
Is Braham's Mace ever going to come back to the gem store? :(
---
&gt; The Mini Gray Skyscale Hatchling has been added as the guaranteed item for the duration of the Dragon Bash Returns Chest.
---
So, for a new player is THIS the time to be opening any BL chests with Keys I've accumulated? Or should I be waiting for August Anniversary event(s)?
---
Also, is this a the Mini Gray Skyscale Hatchling a vanity pet? Or something I'll need to begin Skyscale process to get the adult pet?
---
&gt; but they also flagged you for having Cheat Engine running
---
Or when the hash of an empty string somehow comes into the "Not ToS compliant software" list [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aktctr/more_information_on_arenanets_mistake_in_april/)
---
When I came back to GW2 they had those in the BLC chests. 
---
Those sprockets I converted to vision crystals and salvaged for minor crystals. As someone who had (and still has) no spirit shards, they helped A LOT.
---
Been waiting for this since they broke them back in November
---
Assuming candy corn prices during Halloween ... that will be around 2.5g per bundle or 5s per map currency
---
Thank you! These look great, I'm excited.
---
"gain access to their profession skills" .... hmm.
---
Why am I imagining a full zerk but tanky class with dmg modifers like warrior stealing an entire full zerk sic em soulbeast's kit... then going ham on w/e poor souls are in his way.... oh lord. Surely this cannot be what they mean.
---
(sorry I always expect the worst when it comes to ANet doing 'events' in WvW coughgolemweekcough).
---
That depends on the map ... 2 hearts get you 50 kralkatite in istan.
---
Sick, these'll look great with Sylvari!
---
I have tears in my eyes
---
Not a fan of those skyscale skins, and the pattern swap skins are getting very lazy. There doesn't seem to be much special about these ones and there was so much potential with the skyscale to do cool ones.
---
All kinds of reptile scale patterns were possible - alligators, cobras, chameleons. Instead we got a tye-dye shirt skin and something that looks like rain drops in an ash tray.
---
At this rate, 9/10 people use bioluminescent or branded.
---
Yeah I'm sad rn I cant login q.q
---
Can we have a [Hover Bike from Wildstar](https://images.mmorpg.com/features/5899/images/5-MotorbikeModel_t.jpg) to commemorate a fallen mmo?
---
Are any of these used for the Exordium?
---
Came here for this.  At work for a while longer
---
I dunno, I think they're nice for a bit of variety. I used the Spotted Sylph for a while even though I had Starbound. I think the Caldera skin looks pretty nice.
---
I love them all. Thanks for the pictures! A color other than teal would have been nice since the Dreamthistle ones are also a similar shade....but all things planty I want.
---
not in the patch notes : can use mounts near Hoelbrak spawn.
---
It's like the people who had no idea how Joko escaped the Domain of the Lost.
---
Omg looks fantastic as faaack!
---
Its entirely a vanity pet, its pretty adorable tho.
---
I'm most interested in the demo area thing.
---
Did anyone her of dulfy recently?
---

---
you should download arcdps, it has build templates that will do all the switching for you. 
---
also unless you're switching from power to condi weapons, the rotations don't really change that much. it's usually the situational utility skills and procs that are used differently, if you understand why each skill is used when it is you'll have no problem adapting.
---
...A while back, I used a Total Makeover Kit on my Sylvari Elementalist because I wanted to go for a very specific look, a psuedo-Maokai from LoL sort of thematic...but I could not for the life of me find the weapons skins to really make it pop. And here they are -.-
---
Its just a mini pet.
---
 *2150161\_0645*You are leaving the demo area. Return to the demo or you will be teleported back. 
---
Expansion or something ?
---
Why doesnt anet pay you for this and integrate it into the game already is beyond me
---
I mean, that's what gives less popular BL skins their value. If they did that, then the value of BL chests would go down bc usually people only really love 3-4 skins from a BL set. The 7 tickets partially equalizes the value.
---
lol I literally just finished getting skyscale last night. Oh well
---
&gt; you really don't need more than one
---
I definitely agree with this, I am not a fan of the full pack they gave to Warclaw + now Skyscale.
---
Calm down, you can only buy these weekly so it's not really much of a help.
---
I was in charge of solo the anomalies in both trainings and CM (both get the AP). It wasn't hard to keep my eyes out for them. Trying to lay out the fire to trap the anomalies has a greater risk of people not dodging the knock back attack and dying to the lava as a result. In a pug lacking voice comm, it's almost always  the case.

You will eventually want to have more ascended sets. Trust me. Also, you can just recycle it for those balls of dark energy, which are pretty important to get as well.
---
So Anets image of the standart player is a rifle warrior? That explains a lot
---
Okay, will try
---
yes, if you want to craft a 1h weapon.
---
Yeah. I do training on Raid Academy and favor new players in all roles, so I get to be more creative with team building.
---
Me as well. That tower can go now / I think it’s time for the locals to rebuild.
---
Praise be to Tarrktun! It’s fixed!
---
Just remove the tank's resistance to dhuum auto :\^)
---
Various Account Upgrades also discounted.
---
Honestly it'd be hilarious if this guy joins us in S5 as kind of a blank slate and whenever we go defeat a big bad with a small group, he commands the bigger forces, thus being a "commander" :P
---
warrior?
---
That seems likely! I don't want to get too hyped, but this is enough to encourage me that they are probably working on another expansion.
---
You're not alone. I like my low-key mounts and avoid the super flashy stuff like the plague. Though I prefer the skins with slight remodels, I will take recolor skins I can do more dye-ing with in a heartbeat.
---
After some thinking here are some ideas. I won't mention increased health and/or shortened enrage timer but those things are also a part of making it harder.
---
Vale Guardian:
---
- Failing green circles kills the party instead of dealing damage.
---
- After doing them, green circles will spawn rifts that quickly move towards the boss and will detonate after a short while, like the ones on dhuum but faster.
---
- CC phase gets changed so you have to CC him in a quickly before the boss explodes with his unstable magic and wipes the raid, he is still shooting his energy balls.
---
- After the CC the boss will spawn a shockwave that you have to jump over. Getting hit by a schockwave will teleport you.
---
- Lit up floor. Will already spawn at first phase. second phase will have 2 sections of them and last phase will rotate much faster.
---
Gorseval:
---
- Remove the split phase instead lets spawn big ghosts at certain health intervals.
---
- Orbs. Orbs will spawn much faster now and they are also growing much faster.
---
- Orb debuff. Aside from damaging you and making you do less damage, you have like 10 seconds time ( can be adjusted to have them clean it even faster ) to cleanse that debuff or you flat out die.  Getting downed with that debuff also kills you.
---
- CC Phase. The black puddles will explode much faster now and standing in an exploding black puddle will down you.
---
- Faster flame wall rotation
---
- bombs will kill other players caught in them
---
- After coming back at 75% her auto attack will be changed to Kernans cone attack that she will use on the largest clump of players. The last cone will leave an AOE that deals high ticking damage to anyone standing in it but only last until this attack is done a third time. This attack will rotate with flak shot. ( she also is much faster at rotating now )
---
- After coming back at 50% Sabetha will start pointing her flamethrower downwards and try to heat up the platform while getting a breakbar. The hotter the platform gets the more damage the raid is receiving up to the point where it can't be outhealed. After breaking it, she will use her flamewall only this time its a fast moving flame cone. She also gets a barrier during the CC phase.
---
- After coming back at 25%, her bombs will leave fire AOEs that stay for a long time. Her flakshot also gets changed where she raises her weapon up to the sky and fires the flak shot to every player leaving fire patches where they hit the ground.
---
Still no fix for "Almorra's Directive" becoming stuck then, sweet :)
---
I think that's most people's issue with this model. We are forced to buy all 5 skins even if many only ever use 2 or 3. I know I can find a use for every single skin, but the fact of the matter is, I'd prefer to just buy the few I'll use. That way if I prefer one flashy and one "standard" pattern swap, I can select just those two and only pay for those two.
---
I was hoping the Warclaw was a one-off thing, because it was a "special WvW" mount and therefore the Mount Licenses could be kept separate, but now I see that I was just fooling myself.
---
Isn't this elonian heavy armor?
---
any preview galleries of the weapons/ skyscale skins for those of us at work?  (RIP Dulfy :(  )
---
derplander 2.0
---
It isn't a question of whether it can be figured out, it's a question of whether it should be done at all. It is unimaginative and frustrating way of adding difficulty.
---
Thank you for this. Can you link me to the Support Firebrand that is used in meta please? I would like to know what they use so I can work towards countering them
---
Thank you! I will test it out
---
this one is the Medium weight. Heavy has the shield thing on the butt, you know.
---
My tin toil hat is that this might be a WvW event being used to stage secondary professions in the future, ala GW1.
---
we going lucky landing laddies
---
Ah, kay. Thanks. Looks too close
---
You get both. They still do balance updates.
---
Most skills with no cast time are instant cast and can be used while casting other skills, but there are several exceptions. This is partially because cast time is displayed rounded off to 1/4 second increments, and some abilities with very short cast times are rounded down to 0 in the tooltip. I don't have a list of these skills handy, I just know they exist. A good rule of thumb in this game is to never trust the tooltips, since they are very frequently misleading, lacking important information, or straight up wrong; test the skills yourself if you need fine details about them.
---
Along with your main class, you could pick a secondary class. Elementalist/Ranger. Or Warrior/Monk. Etc. You could change your secondary class basically at will, but you couldn't change your primary class.
---
You would have access to all skills of both classes and could mix and match freely.
---
Classes also had Attributes. Mesmers, for example, had Attributes for boosting their illusion skills, or Fast Casting for lowering cast times. Each class had a unique attribute that was *only* available for it as a primary class. So a Mesmer/Elementalist would have Fast Casting, but an Elementalist/Mesmer would not.
---
It was a fun system for players, but it was an *absolute hellish nightmare* to balance. With access to 9 attributes and hundreds of skills at any given point, there were so many possible combinations that at every point in GW1s history there was at least one completely bonkers broken build that slipped through the cracks. Arenanet never managed to balance it properly. Removing this was one of the core motivations for making GW2 in the first place.
---
I gope this buff encourages you to go raiding again! those videos were hilarious.
---
So does that mean that these offers are weekly? Can only purchase a set number per week?
---
new icons
---
How much do you have?
---
Firebrand Scourge is by far the strongest duo in the game.
---
Tempest + Condi Berserker has synergy together, though.

What's with the blur?

Oh I agree, I hate the idea of doing this.  I am a collector myself.

---
Damn, the bard profession got buffed.
---
I wonder if it'll be something like a special action skill that temporarily gives you their skills, or something forced when you defeat someone.
---
highly worth it.
---
Good for you?  They wouldn't have to do anything.  They could intentionally remove the tickets from the collection or not have a collection if they wanted.  Not saying that is what occurred here, but it's possible.
---
Entirely possible, was just offering an alternative possibility.
---
In this reality, Duncan's ancestors never left Elona to go live in Kryta, and he became a sunspear instead the Commander.
---
Oh you can just buy them off the trading post.

---
Not the person you responded to but thanks a ton for this post!
---
He's actually an Engie, if I recall correctly.
---
Finally!
---
something not related
---
Fairly simple solution in my mind: for tiers of raid just like fractals.
---
T1: Raid Apprentice: Pugs with lousy skills and compositions will still wipe but big attacks are well telegraphed and come in slowly. Basically DPS and stay alive (ignoring mechanics will just be a delay and a hindrance, not death). Any ten randos can get it done if they can just keep alive and follow really basic mechanics. Have a dedicated option at the start to throw together ad hoc groups automatically without needing to browse lfg.
---
T2: Raid Journeyman: Still a learning mode but a real threat. Raiders need to take team composition into account, cannot ignore mechanics, and need to have players with defined roles. Attacks come in at normal speed and frequency but still get more obvious tells, and don't hit as hard. So what might normally insta-down might instead hit for 75% HP or something. This is the area for those in that "I know the mechanics and understand what I'm *supposed* to do...I just need practice to get better at it" stage. Also a great tier for testing various builds and team comps.
---
T3: What is standard raiding now.
---
T4: Hard Mode
---
Adjust rewards by introducing  fragments of magnetite, farting crystals, LI, and LD. You need 10 to be equivalent to one full item of the type in question, and T1 rewards 1 fragment and T2 rewards 5 fragments. Or have T1 reward motes and T2 reward fragments, that can be combined at those same ratios.
---
This provides natural incentive to step up: as you get better at your current tier it'll get boring and repetitive and the next tier will be a faster way to get your rewards. If you really need to prod people to try the next tier, maybe let the first completion on that tier drop an item used to convert the motes/fragments of the previous tier to those of the current one. So that these players need to at least try it in order to have the KPs that groups on that tier want to see.
---
I didn't say any of these things are bad or that we shouldn't do them, just to maybe have some empathy for those who can't come. Jeezus.
---
I agree. It’s a lot of visual noise which is hard for some of us to process. Wish there was something we could do about it though.
---
412 keys wasted, still no pack...
---
Great idea, but Guild Halls are legacy content and won't be touched with a stick.
---
When every little bit counts it sure fuckin did in ESO. They nerfed it but it did make a difference, absolutely
---
Fallen is a strong word for something that essentially grabbed its own steering wheel and decided to ram a brick wall.  
---
From day one that game was destined to fail, some delusional former wow devs of no importance in particular trying to cater to the "hardcore" and hardcore alone with its base design.  
---
Ultimately alienating the market it ended up wanting to chase, the casual one.
---
Shame really, I liked its housing system.
---
Upgrades being discounted is where it's at. I don't think there's been a sale for those in a really long time. Really, they should be permanently discounted, but I'll take what I can get.
---
I hope they do this for all festivals.
---
There is a lot of limitations of choosing to draw this way but then you can come up solution to problems too. The pressure sensitivity of my phone screen really does not work so I have to use flat lines and colors.  
---
Then there is system restrictions since phone has limited amount of memory. I can only work on 10 or so layers if I want to make a big picture. Also I have really limited amount of space to look at so I cannot really use reference effectively (unless I have another screen). 
---
Boredom at work is one of hell motivator to practice. :P
---
That's not a token in this sense though.
---
only race I play :)
---
That's fair, ideally we would just be able to buy skins individually, but Anet has already established they'll never have cheap single skins because that's not economically viable. Considering other options though, this isn't that bad. Buying two specific skins you want from a license pack would already be more expensive than this pack, so even if you're only interested in two of the skins in this pack, it's still a better deal to buy this pack. If you only like one of them though, you're better off waiting for an upcoming mount select license pack.

After a week of grinding you should have double the amount of need mistborn nodes.

They look pretty! Also: nigh impossible to get! (I don’t get a lot of ticket scraps or tickets in general...)
---
See ya.
---
Look man, I respect your opinion - you're allowed to not enjoy things and express that, but I just need to say it again: Just because you guys aren't into it doesn't mean it's a bad idea. 
---
The amount of upvotes on the original post and positive comments in this thread (versus the negative points on you and the other guy's posts) might not prove anyone right or wrong, but they do prove that there are clearly more people who like this idea than you might realize. 
---
What some people label as "cringe" is often just other people having fun in their own way. You don't have to enjoy it, and I won't even stop you for poking fun at the individuals who partake in the activities, but I think it's pretty clear this activity isn't for folks like you, and there are clearly plenty who will enjoy it. As such, it makes perfect sense for ArenaNet to do things like this, be they contests, marketing stunts, or just providing fun resources for players.
---
The event the was super simple compared to this one. But Old Lions Arch (the place where the event took place) had more heart and looked more like the artwork they released with it.
---
You have jump with GS3, blink with 1h sword (meta offhand is scepter but sword isnt that behind, and its actually better on cleave, moving targets and if you need to fill gaps if your teams fury uptime).
---
You also have a permanent 25% movespeed from the 1st dragonhunter trait (down) when running open world (you get the trap trait -up-) when in fractals or raids.
---
Power quickbrand has access to swifness on both their F2 and F3 books, and you can also run retreat shout which can give you permanent swifness of itself depenfing on how much diviners gear you wear (fractal meta runs few to no diviners, raid meta may wear a bit more).
---
On wvw DH roaming build (which is a B tier build) you usually bring firework runes which give you 25% ms or you can use the dh trait again.
---
Alt+F4 is the highest quality screenshot.

Hit or miss, but there are a few of these that I actually really want. The rifle, staff, and longbow especially look neat in this style.
---
EU is the exact same, I sometimes make a lfg, literally thr only one at that moment not asking for kp, and it takes 20 minutes to get to 5 players, and a minute to fill the last 5
---
Doubtful considering some of the old ones never dropped below 80s
---
Just 3 words...
---
** TAKE ^ MY ^ MONEY **
---
Thanks for the post - I just dislike how you can't keep one build/rotation I love Guild Wars 2 but Im not a very flexible person in memorizing things. And it does seem to confirm with what you said, if I dont do waht the raid says I'll be kicked because Im not Condi or Power. 
---
That stinks
---
My new pal
---
&gt;you'll bitch regardless.
---
It already exists as a drop from Death Branded Shatter. I hope this is finally my chance to get one!
---
I'm sorry, what is this about having an onion tied to our belt?
---
Thank you for your valiant sacrifice.
---
Things were so broken you could not nerf skills. Oh lets increase its cooldown to nerf it. Ok were gonna Echo it and be able to cast it twice. Oh increased energy cost. Were gonna use it on a necromancer now with soul reaping energy machine. Nerfed damage? No biggie we will buff it back up with enchantments. Increased cast speed? May i introduce you to mesmsr faster casting. Untill Anet did most of these some skills were just unstoppable to the point they had to be nerfed into the ground by every way possible.

---
what about salvaging your extra hats from ascended boxes and selling the results? For the record I am not for exchanging ascended armor boxes for different types ie hats for legs.
---
that's all the more reason we don't need any more humanoid creatures. you can still have your largos with the backpack... people who want more adventurous races have to put up with MAYBE a combat tonic (kodan fans) or nothing (tengu). 
---
you can love largos, a large part of the community does. but if you want barbie over bird, you're asking for something you already have an abundance of.
---
&gt; nigh impossible to get
---
Having your money tied up in other ventures doesn't mean they're nigh impossible to get. 40-50g is for most people only a few hours worth. If you say something that is only 40-50g is nigh impossible, what words do reserve for legendaries that cost \~2000g. Or the more expensive infusions in the game that go for 10,000g+? Are those just "actually impossible" for you?
---
How does one obtain these?
---
I'm on the spectrum so I get very easily overwhelmed by some of the effects in game and really can't help it. I was with the pride parade a few days ago and I just felt so drained by the end of it, the endless onslaught of cosmetic explosion was *fun* and celebratory but god, obnoxious and shiny effects and characters actually affect my sensory needs in a way I never realized. The actual eye strain and headaches I get from obnoxious infusion blob characters now is actually noticeable. I wish I could turn down particle effects and infusions intensity but it's not an option
---
I'm sure it was all about that 25% Movement speed, right?
---
As opposed to PvP meemers who can’t get out of gold bitching about balance patched. Surely we need more of those threads
---
[It was the style at the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o-7MmhqNfA)
---
Some stat bonuses from traits and runes do not get downscaled, but the formula for converting their stat to crit chance etc. goes up in lower level areas, so they actually get upscaled. Something like 125 Precision gives you like 50% crit chance at level 20. This is unintended, but I hope ArenaNet doesn't care enough to fix it.
---
I've been wanting fashion templates for a while now.
---
In my opinion, I prefer the less-flashy skins, so five for 2000 is a great deal for me as opposed to the same price for a single obnoxiously shimmery skin.
---
That is the coolest! Goddamn! What's the story on this? Fan made?
---
Not everyone can play as much as others.
---
Wow.  Those are beautiful.  Thanks for posting them.
---
Make sure you eat those drawings!
---
Good point. I’m definitely prone to exaggeration, but you’re right. Sounds like I just need to git gud.
---
Not only that but they are looking for people to test the game apparently.  Could be expansion 3 already in the works given the whole company is back on GW2.  Hopefully something big is coming because Anet needs that word of mouth marketing back.

The [Brute Chopper](https://youtu.be/WGv7FsfCVfc) is a vehicle used in Halo 3. Had rockets on the side that could be fire too
---
I’m currently being assessed for placement on the spectrum as well - I get to find out Thursday. The visual effects for me aren’t terrible, but I know they can be a lot for others, and I know they can be a lot for me when I’m already tired and overwhelmed.
---
Halo 3? Is that you!
---
Such a good game
---
I'd think of it as paying 40 gold to skip a day of farming that currency. To those with less time who would just like to enjoy Dragon Bash instead of farming, this would be worth it.

Oh lol

Smiter's Boon anyone?
---
Not worth.
---
Easy mode raids should bridge the gap for players interested in raids but not yet committed. They should not replace raids however.
---
**I think the best way to teach new players is to integrate raid mechanics into the living story.**
---
Say for example you have a story chapter which utilizes the Greens from Dhuum, minus the death penalty. You could have Taimi guiding you through what to do. And then you have a final boss that integrates it into the final fight.
---
This way players would intuitively know what to do when they see Greens spawning in the Dhuum fight. They'd know they have to go left to collect the big orb, and not to go too close to the middle.
---
Living story instances have the advantage of being their own little solo instances for people to practice, and most of the playerbase would be playing it. 
---
Marriage between the living story and rewards. Balanced. As all things should be.
---
i think you get an achievement for killing eye at rank 10.
---
Didn't receive anything significant at rank 30.
---
you can buy the essences or whatever they were called for PoF raid currency
---
Well if its only those 3 coffers every 5 rounds isn't it the same as the public Bash ? Where you also get the Arena Slayer every 5 rounds. Are there any additional loot you can get from every round or its just that ? 
---
If so it seems its not that much more worth it .
---
Probably datamined?  Which means something bigger for next release?
---
Though I see your point the majority of wvw players were naysaying the desert bls due to the unnecessary amount of pve in them when they launched. It was asinine. The middle event area was just something else that no one was asking for and yet they still implemented it and then wondered why everyone complained. The problem with mounts is that they completely negate organic fights because now people just zoom right past you to get to their ktrain. Basically they need less health, or an easy forced dismount feature, you shouldn’t be able to just ignore pvp in wvw.  
---
There have been numerous well thought out valid suggestions in long winded posts on here to Anet about what can be done to help wvw. The problem is that most of these come from hardcore players and the casual people just would not be able to keep up so they’re considered “implausible”
---
It’s 2019, at this point as a wvw main I just don’t care what they do, give me deployable cannons again, I expect no less, I just try to enjoy the time I spend in wvw. I can’t blame people for not thinking the way I do as they are still currently much more invested. I can’t fault them for loving the game mode and wanting to see it cared about again. Don’t forget we went for years without so much as a sentence about wvw and anything we get today is vague and “in the works” or “on the table” 
---
So yeah, you’re going to see the instant negativity. Trying to make unfounded snarky remarks isn’t going to change anything and it doesn’t help. But you do you.
---
take a shit class into wvw and hopefully swap it with someone elses better class and kill ppl with it?
---
The axe and Greatsword are gonna be getting a purchase from me when I get home. I think I like that more than my Sunrise.
---
Will this fix the octave glitch? :o
---
I need as many as I can get.  I mostly only use the pattern swap/model swap skins, and I have 21 characters... I would love for every character to use a different skin option for every mount.
---
Yes, they were very clear when the event was announce that it would be for two weeks and then have to go for raids.
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/meet-the-key-of-ahdashim-on-june-11/
---
I like em all. Not every mount skin needs to be shiny.
---
Well that kinda sucks. I hope they bring the world boss bonuses some day, then...

&gt; Fixed a bug in Challenge Mode that caused Qadim's Rain of Chaos skill to initially target the player chosen to utilize Unleash.
---
Ah crap. I thought I had stumbled on some way to make Q2 target me as the tank after 20% and was trying to figure out what I did.
---
I had been the Unleash "sacrifice" that run.
---
Q/A was sleeping this patch.
---
Scratch that. You can go in with a party like a dungeon (dungeon icon), or get put into a dynamic instance with randoms (talk to Halstein under the dragon icon). Seems to work like the rifts Current Event introduced a while back.
---
 &gt; Though I see your point
---
 &gt; unfounded snarky remarks
---
So you see the point in my unfounded remarks? If they're unfounded, how do you see the point being made?
---
No Charizard skin, no buy.
---
Trust me, I know what you mean. I'm on Dragonbrand and I can't remember a time where we didn't have the outnumbered buff 24/7. Roaming pretty much consists of running away from huge zergs, and baiting sweaty gank groups to chase me across the map. I'm not sure wtf I'm going to do once the horrible dismount ability gets implemented.
---
I saw him at a Golem Mk II WB fight over the weekend, he revived a fully dead guy who refused to WP, so...he also encourages this behaviour?

I am told we'll take our fucked balance and like it because how dare I demand fucking balance in my PvP modes.
---
Bug: If you end the third round of the stampede on your skyscale it appears it might not count for the achievements.
---
They were introduced as an uncommon drop so they get uncommon drop prices. I doubt that anyone will get them at this price, until they get added to the Guaranteed Wardrobe Unlocks. 5 minis/60 = 12 each, while GWUs go for 15.

Can I see?

At least Anet finally added some (optionally) challenging content.

Ghost Skimmer? 
---
Better..... Nade Jumping Springer. Your character endlessly throws grenades under themselves while running to hop and there is no springer.
---
5 Jorbreakers for the Legendary Shards and 10 for Exchange voucher....thats WAY more expensive than SAB
---
You mean you came to jump on the only negative post in the topic and use it as an excuse to complain about "WvWers".
---
There is a cap on how many non-achievement rewards you get from defeating waves, and the cap is shared both by the public activity and the private instanced 5-man one. After you hit the cap, you will only be getting the infinitely-repeatable achievement rewards, which are those 3 coffers per 5 unique bosses killed.
---
Defeats the point of even playing the activity for longer than 2-3 rounds of 5 bosses, if you ask me. Not even mentioning the fact that there is no scaling rewards.
---
How do I open the installer file?
---
From patch notes:
---
&gt;Complete daily festival achievements to earn the Dragon Basher daily achievement, contributing to the Party Commander achievement, which rewards your choice of holographic replica weapons based on the weapons wielded by a famous hero!
---
oh god, don't remember me such things please...
---
This event highly unlikely because it was really tied to the raid but the World boss event will likely come back with the bonus box loot.
---
Compared to other festival reward tracks, especially wintersday, this one feels really lackluster. Also, the pvp version rewards wvw shards
---
This is possibly the best pack I've seen in a long while.
---
More than half of them are excellent, and that's saying something.
---
1.) This quote isn't a claim that no one has any worthwhile ideas, I was pointing out that often the ones screaming the loudest don't provide worthwhile feedback ie: the original comment that started this thread.
---
 &gt; "DAMNIT ANET! I don't actually have any valid suggestions but nothing you do is good enough!!1!"
---
Notice that it doesn't say "no one has any valid suggestions," but utilizes "I," as in this mock-screaming fan doesn't have anything of substance to add to the conversation.
---
2.) It is verifiable that at least some people asked for (a) mount(s) in WvW. You want to accuse me of making blanket statements and then state flatly that no one cared for them?
---
3.) Desert BL was a new map, with new mechanics, which is what people asked for. If people want more of the exact same map, then what's the point other than for visuals? Probably why Anet hasn't made a new map in a long while.
---
Finally, you seem to be getting entirely too worked up over all of this. You recognize there are some exceptionally negative voices that seemingly exist solely to complain, and that is the type of person I made a jab at. You even agreed they exist. You're going entirely too in-depth...for what? Because of a simple "snarky" joke at the broad expense of the negative, non-constructive critics?
---
Once again I point to the first comment that started this thread. We have no real details of how the event will play out, and we get whining about it. How is that conducive to fostering a healthier WvW environment? How is that worthwhile feedback? The short answer is: it isn't.
---
Idek how I’d feel about secondary professions. At this point anything would shake things up for me in this game but hoo boy the balancing necessary for that I just don’t find achievable by the current team. 
---
My question is, what do you get if you kill someone with the same profession?
---
ASURA MASTER RACE
---
Is it purely a coincidence or is it a GW1 reference that he's called Duncan?
---
I've been playing with it, I think the longer octave switch delay is still there. But I need to check it out more tonight. I was pretty laggy this morning with the patch.
---
I loved it!
---
For me it was amazing because friends I played GW2 with were still around.
---
I do think the skill needs a rework of some kind to make it great again, but if they did that, my worry would be that they would redistribute its total damage to accomodate the new pulse when it first spawns, which would make each individual pulse even more of a tickle than it already is. At that point it doesn't matter if the skill is more in line with other skills in its casting behavior, it'd just be a terrible skill, and make staff elementalist even worse.
---
I think they should go the other way. Leave the function of the skill as is, but make it true instant cast. Maybe let it stack up to 2 charges, too.
---
...which nobody will play beyond doing it once to 10 bosses for an achievement. Because the public activity gives the exact same rewards and takes the exact same amount of time, except there you can afk and let other randoms do all the job for you, and there you don't get an increasingly damage-spongy enemies. Sounds like a success!
---
MIX OF HALO AND GUILD WARS?? MY TWO FAVORITE SERIES?? YES PLS.
---
Ghost legendaries.. that's awesome. Then again some of the wrapped winters day ones are clearly legendaries too
---
How do I update this from the older version? I've never been so tech saavy. Updating TACO and this are the 2 things I'd really like to know how to do properly so I can do it all the time. &lt;3
---
Hands and their debuffs? Uhhmm didn't know that Deimos hands also give out a debuff.
---
And I get it, raid population needs to increase, blah, blah, blah. But forcing people to do "introductions" to raid mechanics is not the answer. For one, the outcry for any more complex ones would be big enough that they would have to nerf it. For two, if they start making a pattern of making it more complex it might drive away the casuals which, like it or not, are the bread and butter of this game.
---
I don't think understanding mechanics or the fear of it prevents people from wanting to raid. This is a casual game where you experience the majority of what it offers without much commitment. I don't have the time to sit for 3-4 straight hours to gather a group and learning the fights for a few hours every week, that's why I (and probably many others) don't try raiding.
---
True, but in order to keep raids interesting, anet has to keep pumping out new mechanics. It might be pretty daunting to incorporate even a tiny fraction of them, especially since nearly every boss has something unique about them.  
---
Plus, certain mechanics that look similar can end up requiring different actions (Dhuum Greens are much different than VG Greens)  
---
Maybe they could focus on just implementing the mechanics of the final boss of every wing - Like having to toss a cannonball to help an NPC, having to cleanse nasty conditions in pools of rejuvenating water, standing in a Ward (covered in ending of HoT, I believe), collecting orbs before you spirit dissipates, having to attune to a Pylon to do damage.... etc.
---
ily ru &lt;3 being stuck at work sucks
---
true
---
I personally enjoyed LS1 a lot more than the current seasons. The world did actually feel alive for a bit. That said, I totally understand why they made the decision to move away from it - but loading into LA after the patch hit only to be greeted by a cinematic of it getting obliterated by Scarlet was an experience I haven't seen in any MMO again.

---
That's the fucker.
---
Do these count as Precoursers or are they simply skins? I think I know the answer...
---
Day time... night time!, day time... night time!
---
Most raids are usually 2 hours though. If they do more it's usually people who can actually stay longer or it's announced before raid that it will last longer.
---
You also dont need to wait for gathering because date and time is already known for a few days, so you can either make it or not.
---
Training guilds make getting into raids a lot easier than it looks like.
---
it will be weird. How weapon skills would be handled? If you're holding a thief and you kill a greatsword, what would happen? Using weapons used by the one you killed and not by the one you wield, ok but animation wise how would it be handled? 
---
Maybe it will just be non-weapon skills, and everything you get is randomized from the pool of non-weapon class competence.
---
For instance you kill a warrior, and now your heal becomes Defiant Stance, you get Banner of Tactics, Signet of Might, Fear me, as utility skills and  Rampage as elite.
---
If it's made that, yes, it will be fun. Can't wait to kill a thief and have only utility skill that interact with adrenaline.  
---
Oh, and it's worth noticing that killing a revenant will break everything because of the energy cost (and CDs if there is they just remove the energy cost).
---
&gt; The flying thing (assuming you mean Aurene in the latest chapter), doesn't even fully reset your instance, just goes back to a previous checkpoint, so you don't lose all progress, and I really wouldn't compare it to a raid mechanic, it's basically how to steer.
---
Is there a reason why story steps that tutorial a specific raid mechanic don't do the same thing?
---
When I say dhuum greens, it doesn't have to be a 1:1 copy. It could be presented like a "puzzle" to open a door. And if you fail, you just quickly redo it.
---
None of those things is the reason I don't raid. There is simply nothing I want from it. Except maybe for Adina's Rifle but rifle skills mostly suck anyway.
---
This is gold. $5 for another bank slot thank you Kormir
---
&gt; scale difficulty
---
Does it ?
---
&gt; Maybe they could focus on just implementing the mechanics of the final boss of every wing - Like having to toss a cannonball to help an NPC, having to cleanse nasty conditions in pools of rejuvenating water, standing in a Ward (covered in ending of HoT, I believe), collecting orbs before you spirit dissipates, having to attune to a Pylon to do damage.... etc. 
---
I really like this idea.
---
The problem is, just like with raids, that the competitive community is the size of fly droppings which kills all ground for Anet to allocate more ressources to the gamemode. And since WvW'ers are some of the most toxic and exclusive people in the game ("hi guise i got the core game what do you suggest i play as support in WvW?" - "U DUN PLY CORE") right next to raiders ("filthy entitled casuals wanting additional difficulties OMG THIS ONE DIFFICULTY IS SO BORING TO VETERANS whelp nothing one can do!"), it will stay a neglected gamemode with negligible playerbase with negligible ressources allocated to it, since everything else makes no sense financially.
---
The gamemodes get choked to death bei their own players and there is nothing one can do.
---
Only if, it doesn't block progress I could see it work. But at that point, how much training is the person actually getting, if they just wait for the NPC to complete it?
---
My point is, forcing people to train raid mechanics won't necessarily bring in more raiders, when most have either preconceived notions of them, or are just too afraid (and not of mechanics, they are afraid of the community, because if the community in raids was truly friendly, you guys could test these mechanics to your heart's content without the fear of kicking, in pugs).
---
it is the reward for 5 festival dailies
---
Both scourge and herald are relatively easy to get into.
---
That'S exactly the reason. And they even said it that way. Not everyone loves supernova flashy skins, but the minority of players that would buy the reskins is not enough to justify doing them, but if they bundle it liek this, they can give more variety and the devtime will on average be justified. So it is both scam on you and nice thing that actually adds to the variety and choices.
---
i dont feel like this is what wvw needed

The game at launch was a magical place. Every map past level 30 had huge bugs that stalled events. Our gear and builds were pretty bad, so getting to Orr a week after launch was very special. This was before the mob density and cc nerfs, so it felt like a real invasion where you were literally had to fight from one end of the zone to the other.
---
A lot of people are dying on the rng loot boxes today.
---
They are on the same rarity as the Crystal Infusion so nearly no chance to get them.

Looking at how many gems he/she got then the chance to get all minis and mordrem weapons is quite good.

The whole point is to block progress until someone solves a puzzle.

Why are people okay with dong complex Glint's Lair puzzles in the story, but not okay if something resembles mechanic they might use in a raid?

Not many people raid, everyone can potentially buy from the gem store. It's where the money is, every company knows that raiding is done by a small part of the playerbase.
---
They didn't fail because they were trying to cater to hardcore players. They failed because they were corrupt, incompetent leaders and there was too many cooks.
---
what?
---
2,5s atm. They were at 5s. They *are* dropping.
---
A female norn was used as the Commander's depiction for the base-game, Season 1 and Season 2. There's also other mentions of them using Jennifer Hale (a.k.a female sylvari) for other content and HoT.
---
2, 3, and 5 are nice.  I'm sure I can find a use for the other two.
---
I read the thread, yes. But if you stop to think about it a lot of raid mechanics are already in story instances, here are some examples:
---
VG Teleport - the boss in the Great Hall meta has teleports
---
Gorseval Eggs - any dodge mechanic really
---
Sabetha flamewall - don't remember the exact instance, but it's one of the first ones in PoF in Desert Highlands, doesn't kill you, but still you want to avoid.
---
Also, the story needing to be harder is your opinion. I like it as it is, I don't want to spend hours and hours just to get past a story instance, that's what achievements are for (and before you go there, I complete every achievement, but if the instance itself is a slog, like the Glint's Lair one in LS2 I'm much less motivated).
---
Botters love this.. How about you actually kill the bots that killed the game....
---
PvP is all bots, GvG is like 3 active guilds.. gold trim, ecto, z key, titles... it’s all for $ale on gw1 by the rich botters.
---
In every active town it’s only gold sellers and spam bots... Fix the game don’t bother with a sale it only allows botters to buy accounts for cheaper and make more money which hurt all the “real” gw1 players long ago.
---
Training Communities do beginner runs every week and get a couple of Raid kills every time. It does not take much commitment to start out and usually doesnt last longer than two hours. You just need the will to gear one character properly and learn a bear bone rotation. 
---
The rest is just listening to your commander and being there at time.
---
Did I miss something or why is 20X2 boxes = 6k gems? 
---
40 boxes, each of them costs 200 gems. 40x200 = 8k gems, noch 6k.
---
Yeah sorry I was a dick about it, but people will enjoy your content so much more if you just get to the point. Thanks for showcasing the glider.
---
Looks like a bunch of trash.
---
Wow. Amazing I have to say
---
It looks like there is 25 boss kills -&gt; coffers daily limit?
---
I open them when i like the uncommen drops. Anything rarer is better bought directly if you really want it ;)
---
And then, you can watch those 1xx fireworks sitting in your character inventory 'cause they're soulbound. /gg
---
That is implemented by having the player ride on the moa as mount ...
---
&gt; Currently it costs 1900g to buy 6k gems for 40 bags
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but 40 boxes for 200 gems each are 8k gems, not 6k. So you have to pay ~2700g for 40 boxes, not "only" 1900g.
---
The current default skin if the skyscale looks brutish. It fits with the lore, and it's well designed, but artistically I think it's a huge miss. The skyscale looks infinitely better and more graceful, which I find more appealing. I wish they'd tond down the iridescence and I wish for actual dragon wings. But the body and the face is infinitely better in my opinion than the default skin
---
10 boxes are 1500 gems instead of 2000, it is discounted for 10 box bundle
---
This will be the /v/ sings Devil Trigger of Guild Wars
---
The re-patterns are nice specially to someone like me who has a bunch of alts and just wants a unique skin for each alt. Sometimes simple is good. Those simple patterns/ minor change ones are my go to in  my ranger
---
&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
all pretty ugly... and why would i want to buy a pack of skins for only 1 mount :/
---
Mistlock still worth it? Seems like too many players there now and too many eyesores
---
The whole adventure is balanced around you always using skill 3 + skill 2 to reach pinatas and then using skill 1 to reset skill 3.
---
They all look very undifferentiated except for the branded one. Just like the Warclaw pack.
---
Over-the-top asuran technology is immersion breaking
---
Great job guys. Always good to see this stuff. Matthias was such a fun boss to 4 man.
---
There is no BL collection for these skins. Very unusual.
---
Hmm, I have not touched PvP at all in this game.
---
I assume you have to be decent for it to be worth it?
---
I just have a feeling that PvP will be toxic and I will just get frustrated more than have fun.  But maybe I'm wrong about it.
---
Just curious, do you have sources on this? Not doubting you, just want to read more about it since I haven't heard that before.
---
No please gawd no more legendary anything some of us have lives goddamnitttt
---
Stats scale proportionally. At level 80 you need 21 points of precision per 1% crit chance, but in a level 5 or so area you only need like 4 points per 1% crit chance, and it just so happens your stat values are scaled to 4/21 of their true value. You have lower stat values, but what it takes for them to do 1% of change to their relevant area is equally lowered.
---
*"4" was just an example number, im not sure what the breakdown actually is at that level.
---
Mostly use gw2hook because I think it offered to do away with loading all the effects only once, and then not every loading screen... but maybe that changed with reshade now so it doesn't happen?
---
I had it working yesterday, today I can't see installer.exe. Tried disabling real time windwos defender protection. This is killing me.
---
that is, step two is one attached to the actual mount animation rig that players can use, then u got the mount

Power Holosmith: laser disk vs throw mine
---
As far as I can tell from my rudimentary calculations, the base damage from throw mine results in higher dps than laser disk, regardless of heat level. It also adds a blast finisher and knockback.
---
The advantage of laser disk mostly seems to be that you dont have to put thought into using it; you just hit it and you're done, whereas you have to actively place the mine, and detonate it as well in many cases. I believe the casting time is longer on throw mine as well.
---
Does the mine not benefit from lasers edge/solar focusing lense or something? It seems to have a lot more utility than the laser disk, other than the laser disk continuing while you are downed which can help rally.
---
So why laser disk?
---
The coffers are currently ~40s each right now, so 1000 of them is 400 gold lol
---
I hope they retire this character and use a new one for season 5 trailers.
---
Ahh ok, after reading the OP again I understand. Yeah with damage like the hands do it would be pointless then.
---
My suggestion would have been the orb debuff to not one shot or burst you down in a second but to steadily pulse out medium damage that, if not healed would kill you with the additional effect of killing you after some time if you don't cleanse it with the yellow orbs. Basically if you get the debuff, cleanse it or you die after a set amount of time, if you get downed with the debuff, instead of cleansing the debuff you also get killed to make sure that people don't just down themselves to get rid of the debuff.
---
Perhaps this is too much but since we are talking about suggestions for CMs on older bosses I would say, everything that makes the fight more difficult is allowed ( except if the method is bullshit like some invisible aoes )
---

&gt; Was herald ever meant to be a dps spec?
---
Currently Herald has actually no use in PvE. For Condi dps, Renegade is better. For support, Renegade is also better, even though Herals should be the "support spec". And even if it's not that great either, power Renegade also is better than Herald. 
---
Everything you want to do with Herald, you can do better with Renegade and I think that shouldn't be the case.
---
He's clearly supposed to be elonian (introduced for the PoF storyline) but his name is still DUNCAN.

I was wondering if he wouldn't be better off to just exchange those gems for gold, glad you did the math, ty :p
---
Okay - - still not answering the question. How does this legitimately solve the issue at hand? 
---
A simple increase of the spawned creatures would suffice, yeah? Allow players time to get tags in, yeah? Not, oh, say, jump around a map and hope?
---
Bonus: Do that as a chrono with the trait that makes alacrity on you better.
---
lulw
---
Your constructive deeds are vastly appreciated
---
Congrats, looks great!
---
..and, this that one furry guild?
---
Accuracy at its finest.
---
It isn't any fun and the output is terrible for the effort that has to be made here; utterly nonsense to call something a "Stampede" when you instead have to run around a map with minimal return.
---
Thank you for an honestly quality producing post :)
---
People dont play MMOs to have fun. They play it to get thousands of currencies that they buy things with!!!

The only downside to Mistlock...can’t just wp out.

[Also.. I need more inventory space (not even all of them yet haha)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/282599211021631488/593202790457802776/gw011.jpg?width=951&amp;height=535)

It’s the right term. If there’s confusion that’s because of the focus people have on similar mechanics that take in cash and spit out boxes.
---
10,000 kills of own profession awards title "Suicide Squad"

.. and 2 AP
---
Maybe finally they’ll update skyboxes for all maps adding horrizon paintings. That would be awesome.
---
Of fucking course Asura are the first ones to get a racial chair.
---
Power alacrity renegade is currently one of the best class for damage + support where you output respectable damage while providing alacrity.
---
To level up, mainly run around the map and do events. If you are confident, make a lfg and do story dungeons.
---
You're playing really badly if you can't tag mobs in this event. There are like a dozen holograms up at one point and most people are on the commander tag zerging, leaving some holograms to go untouched for 3+ minutes. If you can't tag a hologram in 3 minutes, ArenaNet can't help you.
---
How do the mercenary slots work?
---
Asura in the pic here - the active players do have a lot of charr but no we're not a furry guild! We do like cats though so our tag is \[Purr\] :'D
---
With my current build (berserkers, scholar, etc), im at 2518 power.
---
Assuming 50% heat for calculations to favor laser disk as much as possible.
---
**Laser disk**: 335x18 every 30 seconds + 970 from **blade burst** every 30 seconds, total of 7000 every 30 seconds or **233.3 DPS**
---
**Throw mine**: 1339 every 15 seconds + 5x 747 from **mine field** every 17 seconds, total of **89.2 DPS** from throw mine + **219.7 DPS** from mine field, grand total of **308.9 DPS**.
---
The abolute highest I can make the Power stat go on the gw2skills build editor is **3797**. Thats rifle, scholar, zerk everything, 18 +5 might infusions, superior sharpening stone, plate of jerk poultry, 25 stacks of might, and even choosing Blasting Zone over Glass Cannon in explosions for sake of this calculation. Here go the numbers:
---
**Laser disk**: 556x18 every 30 seconds + 1792 from **blade burst** every 30 seconds, total of 11800 every 30 seconds or **393.3 DPS**
---
**Throw mine**: 2221 every 15 seconds + 5x 1253 from **mine field** every 17 seconds, total of **148 DPS** from throw mine + **368.5 DPS** from mine field, grand total of **516.5 DPS**.
---
I have to be missing something here. I didnt take into account crit chance or ferocity, let alone sigil of force, scholar bonus, or any of that, because as far as i know all of that applies equally to both utilities.
---
So...help?
---
I got u bb
---
320 slots ftw
---
Tibia 7.6 comes to mind, it’s probably the only mmorpg with actual dangerous map that u are scared to explore because something(or someone) can kill u and because of death penalty u rly don’t want to die
---
the story telling made a huge jump in season 2, but I really hated how they released dry top and the silverwastes. every few months a piece of the map.
---
You're over thinking it. The entire RPG genre is based on D&amp;D initially and many of the devs probably grew up playing it. It's bound to have suffused their collective unconscious anyway. And of course, D&amp;D is just an RPG based on Lord of the Rings. We're all essentially just moving the bar a bit at each time, further away from the original, but it's all still there lurking in the background.
---
You can wp put, just change the layer (this can be done with shift+scroll) but it's just linking that's broken because misclick is on a fourth level whereas most of Tyria works on 3 layers
---
The majority of classes can play both damage and support (in some form or another) for PVE end game content, and the meta shifts and changes with balance patches. I'd focus more on finding a class you enjoy playing. 
---
The fastest way to level, assuming you have no tomes of knowledge, is to kill yellow mobs out in the open world. GW2 has a system where the longer something is alive, the more XP it grants. Yellow mobs (normal animals usually) don't aggro unless attacked and tend to stay alive longer than anything else. Pop an XP boost, go around killing those and you'll be 80 in no time.
---
I'll buy one for you buddy 80s is nothing
---
You can simplify a lot of your calculations by only looking at the Power coefficients of the abilities, since that's all that matters when comparing the damage of different abilities. Power is variable depending on party buffs, but a Power coefficient of 0.4 always does 80% as much damage as a Power coefficient of 0.5 in the same scenario.
---
Assume over 50% Heat:
---
Laser Disk: 18\*0.5=9.0 per 30s.  
---
Blade Burst: 1\*1.0=1.0 per 30s. Normally 0.8, but does 25% more damage (equivalent to Power coefficient increases by 25%) above 50% Heat.  
---
Total: 10.0 per 30s; 0.33 per second.
---
Throw Mine and Mine Field are a bit different because the Detonate command results in an explosion that deals less damage than if the boss steps on them. Since you have to detonate them manually in most cases, then you have to consider them at the lower value, something I did not do for my original scratch calculation.
---
Throw Mine: 1\*1.65=1.65 per 15s; 0.11 per second.  
---
Mine Field: 5\*0.7=3.5 per 17s; 0.21 per second.  
---
Total: 0.32 per second.
---
It appears at first glance that they are roughly equivalent, with Throw Mine being better if the boss walks over the mines for you. However, what we have not considered is cast times, which is quite possibly the most important factor here.
---
Laser Disk and Blade Burst: You spend 0.75 seconds casting these skills to do a combined output of 10.0 Power scaling.
---
Throw Mine and Mine Field: You spend 1.5 seconds casting these skills to do a combined output of 5.15 Power scaling.
---
Spending time casting abilities is time you could spend casting other abilities (obviously.) It isn't so much that Laser Disk contributes more to your DPS; it's that it sacrifices far less of your time casting, which means your DPS in between casts of Laser Disk is higher.
---
Scenario: You fight a target for 3 minutes, at which point it dies. For ease of calculation (which will also benefit Throw Mine), let's assume that your abilities go on cooldown when you *start* casting them, rather when you finish casting them. You can either cast Laser Disk and Blade Burst 6 times each (the 7th time being at 3 minutes, and thus has no effect), or you can cast Throw Mine 12 times (the 13th time at 3 minutes) and Mine Field 11 times.
---
In that time, you spend a total of 4.5 seconds casting Laser Disk and Blade Burst, and 175.5 seconds doing something else; or, you spend a total of 17(!) seconds casting Throw Mine and Mine Field, and 163 seconds doing something else. You can clearly see that Throw Mine is not cast-time-efficient, so any DPS gains you could possibly get from it are canceled out by the fact that you can't autoattack as much, or whatever else contributes to your DPS.
---
The daily alone is 2g a day, and every 22 days you get 20 mystic coins which are worth 1.5g each. That's 74 gold in 3 weeks if you do nothing but log in and complete the daily. Don't pretend like the game doesn't just hand you gold for doing sweet fa.
---
Duncan is a normal name, not sure what the reference would be
---
&gt; PoF should have given us new Elonian followers, but all we got was Zafirah, and way too late into LW4.
---
Sayida....
---
Present for episode 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. I'd say she counts as "new Elonian follower".
---
&lt;3 &lt;3 Shetsa &lt;3 &lt;3
---
I still think that the cancelled mobile game was guild wars 1 for Android/iphone
---
That’s still 50 more a week than I was getting before.
---
Thanks I am also leaning towards it as I prioritize fractals over WvW. And gives a different non DPS role option which might be nice
---
They used all 10 commanders for narrators during Season 3, here and there. At least three per trailer had a line used. Always lines from the episode itself.
---
Season 2 had a bald male human in vigil armor though, not a female norn in T3 heavy armor.
---
I will look into scrouge. I have seen necros in fractals spots probably viable
---
The new raid wing already did that! Thanks for saying that, making my evening :)
---
A gold run for this adventure. My time can easily be improved upon but super fun regardless! 
---
Plus there are 2 achieves that can definitely be completed earning a gold medal. "Record Basher"(5AP) and "I Can Outrun A Dragon"(3AP)
---
I drew the same conclusion. I wonder if it is more efficient in short fights that might not even last a full burst rotation, or ones where you have a lot of adds or need lots of cc. In solo play the mine offers another blast finisher for healing in the heal turret's water field, which can also be helpful. Then again, solo play is easy enough that nothing about it really matters
---
Still wondering why they haven't added skins for the new mounts to the adoption license in the gem store. Seems we'll be waiting a while to finish off our skin collections until they finish milking these pack sales.
---
They were still doing updates every 2 weeks at that point so you got more well every 2 weeks, not every few months.
---
I am actually in the same dilema, currently lvl 15, just finished killing the jotun king with my nord
---
surprise! there goes your gems
---
The first season was so slow at the start and i remember i was mad because nothing happen except you going around hitting on signs and other stuff. It was a build up ofc. Then it started to pick up and we got the dungon, The lornar pass event with the scarlet robot my god this was the best even i ever made at any point in any game i played. It was fun and so rewarding and i could do it over and over and over. And the big weird tower in Kessex Hills, that one was amazing and the whole story in it. The tower it self was brilliant and i think this is the first time we run in to mobs who really could mess you up. Then the war in Lions Arch. After the lornar pass event that was the biggest moment also. A 45 min event that started over and over and over. You kill stuff, rescue people everything is burning and mobs are scary, and then mini bosses drops and then you move up to the area where Scarlet are and you kill this holographic boss and again we were not that used to all the damage flooding around and it really felt like it was dangerous. The whole thing both story and the events that came with it and that dungeon, it is what i remember the most about GW2 if i think back what i liked the most during the 7 years we played. It was very well made. Could have had a better start but when it finally started to happen you were very in to it and every new event was better then the one before.
---
I hope that's a bug...
---
{raises hand}
---
;-)
---
Which Ghola is this?
---
Agreed. Instead of trying to balance wvw. They thought of a quick gimmick they will make it more imbalance...
---
Wait a min, I think I know this player 😮
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...
---
Buut due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). We have plenty of experienced heroes of different classes there that can guide you to the right direction.

where are my awakened skins for beetle, warclaw, and skyscale?
---
Anyone else not recieving rewards/participation for Hologram Stampede? I've participated twice now - tagged mobs in several places - and got nothing from it, from what other players tell me in game there's nothing else I need to do in order to participate? No NPC to talk to to register or something like that? I've sent in a bug report, just thought I'd check here if anyone's had the same problem and found a solution - kinda sucks to miss the daily Holo Wrangler today with reset in 40 min. :(
---
You mean ruin balance!
---
It won't. We know for sure Halloween is a recurring event, while it could take a few years to get the next Dragon Bash. Also, you can get candy corn via home instance nodes. 
---
It won't come anywhere near 2,5g, but still it will be much, much cheaper than 40g.
---
Okay - - so, this isn't the point. The point is that the spawned locations are melting and are not providing players credit. When we utilize mechanics (like a Commander tag) that are designed to encourage group play, spawn locations should 1) provide credit and 2) last long enough at each location for said squad to get there (within a reasonable time)
---
Jumping all over a map and hoping to tag because the event spawns all over does not solve this problem that many players are having.
---
ME TOO. SEND GOLD.
---
THANKS.
---
I'm not sure I agree with your statement about holosmith and AOEs; bombs and grenades both provide a lot, corona burst is excellent, and photon forge 5 is also very powerful.
---
I know plenty of other classes have a lot more, but i wouldnt say holosmith is particularly lacking.
---
Anywhere when you die and can't rez ! You could choose a team mate and see through his/her eyes. Maybe really hard to dev.
---
Oh wait... It was in GW1. /s
---
;)
---
r/inclusiveor
---
I never ever claimed to play alone.... You are the one commenting when my comments were for the OP.
---
You’ll learn and grow or maybe you won’t.. who knows
---
BRB making Nevermore and using these as alternate weapons! :D Always wanted a character themed around Nevermore but wasn't inspired to but these are helping me figure it out!
---
Only costs you 30g if you buy the jors.
---
Yeah it needs to be scaled. We just did a second run and I actually got gold this time and 17 kills and she got 16 with silver, but the only reason we did that is that we went the opposite direction of the tag and waypointed to ones that were far away. After it ended saw a good 2-5 people again say they didn't get credit. 
---
It's nice that it's every 15 minutes but I could really see people on bad builds or those without mounts NEVER getting credit for this in its current state.
---
Most collections are 16 tickets. Only the very first ones had 19 tickets, as they included underwater weapons.
---
It's all part of the grand plan.
---
By which I mean, they aim to get players to spend $1k.
---
Yes! Now we have a re-supply of one of the most used potions in fractals!
---
does wh have special sound?
---
Technically they can be bought for real cash via gems and gold.
---
As much as I love video games, I am for regulation on this issue. 
---
If any in game item, redeemable for cash or in-game currency, has a permanent RNG affect upon acquisition then said game should be subject to gambling law.
---
If devs want "surprise mechanics" then they can be part of the base game, and not implemented via micro transactions. Digital cash shops will still make plenty of money, but they will make less as they won't be able to take advantage of minors and other vulnerable users.
---
Honestly Druids have been slowly phased out of meta play due to the constant slams to their other utilities, like Spirits for example.
---
Chrono, or Mesmer in general only really lost their incredibly broken SoI boon spreading, which allowed them to perpetuate boons among their subgroup/party.
---
Quickbrand is definitely a good Quickness source but Chrono's strength now is to simply "support the supports" so to speak.
---
It's Alacrgade which is very dominant right now because damn who doesn't like perma Alacrity and boosts of Might stacks?
---
In short: Renegade and Firebrand are a hand in hand pair which dominate the support scene.
---
Chronomancer can be used to substitute either one of them if the situation arises, but it can also support either one of them so that their builds can be tweaked to allow more dps due to SoI's boon extension.
---
I want to know if this is intentional DR or a bug as well.
---
Guild Wars has a lot of references, so it wouldn't surprise me too much if there were direct references to D&amp;D.
---
That one furry guild? There are like 5 or 6 to my knowledge (and I'm the GM of one of them)
---
Don't you have to use them _in_ Hoelbrak though?
---
Oh trust me, I will! I plan to! The issue is for people who don't wanna do that. A lot of people don't wanna interact with the cash shop.
---
*cough* improvements *cough*, Only an idiot would buy from this vendor. 1 jorabreaker is neary 28g meanwhile the actual value of the legendary shard chest is ~ 6.99g
---
Don't worry it's all part of the grand plan.
---
That is, get players to spend $1k.
---
it's mostly used in 99cm and 100cm since arkk is technically one of scarlet's alliance
---
Ah. I was thinking it would just let you have the game play one of your other characters for you, but this makes more sense.
---
Are they worth it?
---
I really wish I could have been there! ;; Take care you beautiful people
---
Really? I’ll write that down for my next 100CM run, thanks!
---
Turns out pinatas have the same problem....switched to different character and stopped getting them
---
r/unexpecteddune
---
These are not from chests? Chests have ugly embellished weapons. Bioluminescent in OP are from Black Lion Weapon Specialist.
---
It's not necessary, but can give you some more flexibility with team builds, and if you play multiple characters it can give you hero access earlier than normal.  One of the most popular hero comps right now is stacking a lot of Mesmers, but to do that you need to get Norgu (halfway through Nightfall) and Razah (beat Nightfall) to go with the easily attainable Gwen, so it takes some time to get there on a new character.  You can use a Mercenary Hero slot to port your Mesmer character over to other characters and get that train running earlier, and then eventually even stronger once you're able to stack all four Mesmers together to melt things with Energy Surges.
---
But it isn't necessary by any stretch.  The default heroes are more than enough to manage.
---
Sounds like someone should look for their missing sister more often.
---
ANET, shame, same 6 yr old junk still dropping.
