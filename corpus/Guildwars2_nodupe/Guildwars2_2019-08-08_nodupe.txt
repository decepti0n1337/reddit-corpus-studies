Gotta add more desaturation until black and white like an old photo that we'll never get.

---
you know what is shittier than saying a game is dead, is when a person go out of their way to make a video about a certain topic, but not commit enough to use his/her real voice and expect people to be like "damn he/she is right".
---
You finish the rest of the warclaw achievement.
---
I'm pretty sure they mean the rarity as in "Oh there's only 10 of those in the game" as opposed to the item colour system that we have.
---
what you mean is the support cannot delete it from their end
---
Pretty funny, actually. Hated the robot voice though.  I've said stuff like this all along. Hyperbole doesn't really win arguments.  Don't know that I needed to watch a whole video about it though. Bit overkill.
---

---
Trying to police what people say on the internet is like trying to teach kids to enjoy reading. You might win a few hearts and minds, but most of the time you're not going to make a huge dent. lol
---
CANTHA CONFIRMED!
---
Is it just Fanta Sea?
---
Okay that too.
---
What's the most profitable pvp reward track from a raw gold standpoint?
---
I use crafting to level up my alts when i run out of tomes
---
Ghosts of Ascalon is good, Sea of Sorrows is all right but has a bad case of a mary sue protagonist. Edge of Destiny is horrible, which is s shame as it is a essentially a prequel to the game.
---
So, you would rather judge a person/video/argument based on the person's/content creator's voice and ability to speak, than the actual content they are arguing. I see!
---
This is why this game has been dying since they added that stupid fucking retro jumping game. The game doesn't know what it is , and neither do the dev's.
---
I have crafted a massive tinfoil hat. Greg Miller has played games almost exclusively on consoles and frequently jokes about the inconvenience of playing on PC. WHAT IF... one of the projects Anet has been working on is a console port of some kind, then Greg would be the perfect person to announce it. This does seem highly unlikely as my understanding of the game code, core Tyria especially, is that it's a little... messy. Which would make for a challenging port to any platform. FF14 plays wonderfully on consoles and I think GW2 is a good fit with its action oriented combat. But ultimately it seems like too much work given the absolutely massive amount of game content and the game's coding.
---
There's many possible reasons other than 'lack of commitment to use voice-synth. 
---
Maybe an alligator ripped his throat off.  
---
Or he's a woman and things she won't be taken seriously by the gaming community.  
---
Or he just sucks at speaking English but can write it just fine for a text-to-speech engine to generate the voice. 
---
Or his mother is a reactionary neo-Luddite that storms his room every time she hears him speak near the computer, thinking he's talking with Al-Qaeda pedophile gay muslim-mexican terrorists or, even worse, people who play videogames. So he is forced to use a synthetized voice with headphones on.
---
Great job with this, thanks for sharing!
---
It would seem that they have kind of a "Matter Replicator" inside of them.
---
When chak eat magic, the have  the Spencer organ stripping 'death magic' from pure leyline magic so they can digest it.   
---
Chak do not seem to eat anything else, so they may have lots the ability to eat and became dependent on leylines.    
---
For them is kind of like nectar or pollen for bees. They keep it in hives and raise their eggs near them, and it's all they eat.  
---
So they must have a similar organ that uses magic to produce the nutrients their bodies need.   
---
In the case of skyscale, they can also eat normal food as we give them foodstuffs both when raising them and as an idle animation. But we have no clue about how much of either they need to survive. Maybe they are fine with just magic and they like normal food just for the taste, maybe the can live in just normal food and they can eat magic as a bonus just to make them grow faster and to allow them to fly. Maybe they need both equally.
---
Super nice. I'm interested in the setups, especially the marines' because I have a Norn I styled as a dirty Space Doggo :)
---
GW2 NPC dialogue is so bad it‚Äôs on par with that of Oblivion, change my mind xo
---
[Here is a gallery of all the skins they've shown so far](https://imgur.com/a/6X6NRJO).
---
It's probably just the 5G radiation waves.
---
[removed]
---
Probably not. As it's consoles and only affects future games. But anet already has a brief chart for chest displaying all items in rarity.
---
Yeah they never promised that, just that they were looked into maybe doing skinless legendaries.
---
Worth it for the tools. I then made about 300 gold getting lucky with dyes in black lion chests.
---
*Have you heard of the high elves?*
---
Fair, might just be me remembering it wrong, it was only "properly" talked about on a pre-release livestream after all.
---
Seems a bit too long of a survey for me, personally. The reason I like virtual games is to escape the reality of the real world, run by only a few corporations and 'elite' people. Bilderbergs, Illuminati, Freemasons, Skull and Bones, etc.
---
My gaming time is coming to an end though. As soon as I heard 5G was coming to my area I knew I had to get the fuck off the grid. If the radiation wasn't bad enough already, it's going to get worse. I'll have to say goodbye to gaming and modern conveniences, but my health is more important.
---
The buildup that spans several missions is actually pretty well executed and while the fight is lacklusting mechanically and it makes it bad in terms of gameplay it was narratively cool
---
Ehm... there never was any promise like this...
---
What's your source? Maybe you mix it up with the legendary journey, the precursor collections. These were missunderstood as "cheaper" ways to get legendaries. 
---
Otherwise, no there were no promise like this at all.
---
Yes i might've mixed it up being something they talked about on the livestream pre HoT release instead of being a promise.
---
Thus editing the context after u/sirrush mentioned my mistake.
---
Thank you.
---
Crafting is essential for getting some weapon skins (Astral/Stellar/Dragonsblood/probably more), legendaries, and getting ascended weapons/armor reliably.
---
[gw2crafts.net](https://gw2crafts.net) if you just want to level the crafting skills.  Otherwise, play around!
---
Gorgeous!! Are you going to put on a ship or 2?
---
there are still so many left, it will take up steam to enforce the same rule before there is even a chance for that number to be small enough and even then...
---
I can't wait for all the 0's followed by a 1.
---
I feel like your answer was mostly PvE focused when the post seemed more interested in PvP.
---
gw2 pvp is full of bots and griefers and is losing actual players because it's neglected by anet
---
i dont remember anet mentioning anything like that
---
You right. Let's just remove the mount altogether ü§ó
---
Guardian has insane support capabilities through picking the Firebrand elite specialization, and other trait-lines. You'll have some of the greatest healing and boon support if you build for it. 
---
Necromancer isn't quite as support oriented, but can become a fairly potent healer as a scourge with large amounts of barrier application. It's also one of the tankier classes, though there are few instances in Guild Wars 2 where tanking in the traditional sense is truly required.
---
inb4 "heres all the stuff that was too shitty for the gemstore" but they never say it out loud do they
---
strictly in terms of ar sure.
---
you could also technically go 22*6+18 and skip doing anything to any trinkets or alt water it down freely by having max infusion slots.
---
outside of ar. you could get +5stat for every infusion slot which adding across all equipments(upgraded)  adds up nicely, and why would you not want to get more stats.
---
When you do your crafting leveling use a booster and a guide.  You will use far less materials and level quicker. You won't have to make as many things as the guides suggest so be mindful of that
---
So I have a plethora of different dungeon weapon and armor chests from pvp and wvw. I never use them as the stats are not good. Is there any efficient way to use them for gold or anything, or should I just unlock skins and delete them?
---
&gt;why would you not want to get more stats
---
Because it's not needed? But seeing as you're a min maxer I guess all my points are irrelevant here so whatever.
---
TBH with you you wont really find your pvp itch here, regadrless of what he Anet fanboys might tell you Anet does not really care in the interest in their end game content outside of open world maps, raids are updated once every 9 months ( if we are lucky) WvW has essentially been untouched ( outisde of an unneeded and unwanted mount) for years and sPvP is a game mode slowly bleeding out due to Anet giving no real attention to updates outside of open world and their gem store. 2v2 Arena are being added soon but you have to keep in mind that this was something  they already had in the game serveral months prior that they are only randomly putting in permanently now after 7  years. If you're looking for a game to really invest your time into this isnt it, however if you only want to play once every 3-4 months then its probably perfect for you
---
thats fine for you to believe but considering the diffrence btw exotic and ascended is only 215stats i dont feel like 90 is something to scoff at.
---
especially when you want absolute maximum dmg output.
---
and its easy to get and a permanent effect.
---
I think one of the core problems with GW2 is that the developers over-rely on timegating and ‚ÄúRube Goldberg mechanics‚Äù to artificially extend the life of content.  
---
For example take the new Legendary Runes.  Rather than simply making rune changing a feature of legendary equipment, the developers implemented a lengthy and timegated process to unlock and craft Legendary Runes.  
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the timegating is intentional so that is encourages people to buy gems and convert them to gold.  In all honesty, this is bad game design in my opinion.
---
Animation setting has to be medium or higher.
---
That would be the best solution, I think.
---
http://dulfy.net/2015/10/16/gw2-guild-chat-new-legendaries-and-changes-livestream-notes/
---
Twice Told Legend achievement is only obtainable with set 1 legendaries and not obtainable with set 2 legendaries. They are working on a way for people to unlock a recipe to craft a naked legendary that allow you to select stats
---
Crafting before 80 is so irrelevant, that payers skip it until maxed. Then you just level it to max, if you are sure you have all required materials or money.
---
Then you pick guide to do it quickly, and cheap way. In less than hour your crafting is maxed forever, ready for future use.
---
&gt;change my mind
---
"That's quality armor."
---
Only if you want the stuffs.
---
My best advice would be to just jump in.  Get any character to lvl22 and the PvP icon will appear (or keybind "PvP Panel" in control options and you can access it at lvl3).  In Structured PvP characters are automatically max level with all core skills unlocked.  This means you can create a character, try it, then delete it and try a new class fairly quickly.
---
Here is an [in-depth guide](https://www.godsofpvp.net/guides/getting-started/introduction-r1/) and a website with [good builds](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guardian#conquest) you can check out if you want to dive deeper.
---
Guardian is probably a good choice, as it can be pretty versatile.  I like the [Radiant Hammer](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Guardian_-_Radiant_Hammer) build for Core Guard if you're looking for a place to start.
---
This may help: [http://pwniversity.com/gw2/crafting](http://pwniversity.com/gw2/crafting)
---
I'm surprised that you of all people join in the ranks of internet crazies to argue semantics. You always seemed like a normal, sane person to me.
---
Why are people worried if the game is dead? You don't need other players for the Living Story endgame :Kappa:
---
Nope. Rewards scale based on level.
---
Axe/Axe Greatsword, maul is a huge part of your burst damage so you want greatsword but axe 4 and 5 are actually the hardest hitting skills. Mainland axe isn‚Äôt ideal but it gives you range and isn‚Äôt awful in open world because the auto attack stacks might for you :)
---
Heh, you're welcome. I'm afraid I don't have some crazy super tip for you that allows you to breath through the content. But I guess then it'd become boring again, wouldn't it? ;)
---
Oh, another thought. Use sigils that help you. Maybe sigil of endurance or whatever it is called, that refills your endurance bar by 25-50 per cent at weapon swap. That extra dodge might come in handy.
---
I don't know if you're new to the game or just some player looking to shake things up, but if you haven't done HoT by now: [the difficulty makes a bit of a jump there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQvSbjjFvCY).
---
Holy shit that's OLD news. I THINK I actually remember that from WAY back. Pretty sure it's dead though. 'Naked' legendaries would be amazing however.
---
Relatively new. Only had the game for a week but feels like I've had it for months. I'll probably be getting HoT in a few days, so hearing it's difficult excites me. Thank you!
---
Major sigil of energy requires lv39
---
There's actually no minor version of it. Wow.
---
...wait, not every sigil has a minor version of it?!
---
I use the raid builds in open world and absolutely love them, honestly. Radiance and Zeal are great DPS traitlines, and Firebrand has enough active defenses to survive even in full glass gear. Quickness on command makes everything, even harvesting and mining, quick and easy. Aegis is a free block from time to time so you don‚Äôt worry as much about getting into combat with mobs you‚Äôd rather run past than fight.
---
Roaming, But in a squad of usually 2-14 People. More than 15 and it's usually a Guild Rally . 
---
1 person is what most consider " True Roaming" , because the idea of roaming implies some Risk of being caught with your proverbial pants down if you're not careful. 
---
This risk is Not present when you're running in a squad, as at least one person in the squad is a dedicated Support.
---
Very cool
---
Brilliant, cheers.
---
That's hardly the same as "cheaper legendaries", so?
---
Don't fight more than 1 enemy at a time, hard to do since you get aggro from far away. Send your pet to get aggro and kite, kite, kite. Use ravaging gear and stick to shortbow.
---
I like gw2 storyline, itd pretty good since HOT, didn't like before it tho
---
Maybe not typical for a newbie post but pretty typical for a "looking for challenge" post. This is simply turning things into damage sponges(due to level difference) while veering into oneshot territory(also due to level difference ...).  That is pretty typical for posts talking about challenge.
---
Are you aware that with a big enough level difference enemies  become immune to your conditions?
---
Thanks!
---
I hope you do realise that there are other things a company can sell than ~~insidious gamling~~ loot boxes.
---
You know, putting our like that only makes me feel stupid.
---
Whenever I shoot enemies with any of my stunning or concussing attacks it just says "immune" and does nothing.
---
Remember that the players on Reddit tend to be a bit jaded. As a new player, you won't run into their existential problems not for half a decade. Try out the pvp (it can be free). I recommend core warrior for fast paced fighting experience. Necro can be too.
---
I can deal with the mesmer, but fuck that cleric lol.
---
It really sucks how the events in that zone scale really poorly, though. If you don't have a sizable group on it's hard to get anything done.
---
What's at the edge of the map? Are there just tall mountains and "strong currents"?
---
Not being an ass here but that kind of thinking is a big reason why anet and others dread talking with the community in general. Any and everything that gets said about potential future plans gets taken as 100% literal fact  that it will happen (or promised) even when its not stated as such. Then things can and do change in a development cycle, priorities shift and things can get dropped. Before that people can make mistakes about what is planned vs being talked about ie just an idea. 
---
In the video (11:50 or something the question gets asked) the first thing brought up is the wardrobe system and how it already covers the skin side of things, they even bring it up again before moving on to the next skin showcase.
---
Decrepitude is one of my favorite skills mentioned in this video. The idea of it is actually really unique!
---
I have a full legendary pvp armor and don't even know 2on2 was a thing. Queues would be great. Maybe then someone is playing these maps.
---
Ok, I completely see how this is a problem but...
---
That amount of effort, to take a tower right next to spawn, which is never going to be held by any other server for more than 10 minutes...
---
To be completely honest, I think it would be more effective to just ram the darn door.
---
In fractals you almost never use raid rotations though, fits that category, you also have extra stats which change your build yada yada.
---
Tbh all fo the game feels weird without ala/quickness to me. Mainly because i only raid and do fracs i think but still.
---
Definitely true but at this point ARR is just 25% of the story with the rest of the expansions pretty much blowing the base story out the water. 
---
Now the fact that said expansions and story can only be reached AFTER beating ARR is the huge annoyance. Although they've recently said they're making it more compact, GW2's story wins in the accessibility department.
---
The Dragon
---
Expect them fix this in a couple of... never.
---
It's F2P, you don't have to ask, disillusion yourself by listening to the downers, or create false expectations by listening to its fans. Just download it and try it out to see how you like it.
---
You can just hop in because PvP in Guild Wars 2 requires no leveling. You can customize to use top level gear from the very get go. Except WvW, which is essentially a PvP-flagged sandbox with only moderate level scaling that will require you to level up to 80, get good gear, and constantly sink gold into it for food and boosts.
---
Yup. They've been playing this game for so long now. Push and push and push, see what you can get away with. When there's outcry, ease up a bit and adjust the model. I think everyone is just tired of it, at least I hope so. Unfortunately there seems to be enough people that aren't tired of it that they probably don't care about the majority who are.
---
You're essentially saying that probability doesn't exist so long as the outcome isn't guaranteed... but that's completely ridiculous.
---
Open your eyes and look up to the sky and see~... Ah shit it's a elder dragon!
---
Because raiding builds on Snow Crows's website is only good for instanced PvE, which is only a small portion of the overall game. 
---
Stunbreaks, condi cleanse, boons, and CC (for things other than to just break a defiance bar) are all extremely important things for new players to take into account and familiarize themselves with. Just because those things don‚Äôt have much relevance in raids doesn‚Äôt mean that the aren't crucial for other formats where builds are much much more important.
---
&gt;produce new content for us? 
---
You can keep saying this, but you all know deep down that the only content that you're getting when you spend on the gemstore is more shit to buy on the gemstore. To your main point, they can sell things on the gem store that aren't loot boxes. They lock desirable skins and items behind an RNG box where you can spend hundreds and still never get the item you want. The fact that anyone supports this practice makes me sad for the future of gaming. The moment I realized where the keys for those little black lion chests I was getting came from, I wept for the future of gw. Things have only gotten worse.
---
Sadly no mounts in here.  
---
\-agreed.
---
I ran into this issue as well at some point, where I wanted to make a character with G Nero in it. The only reason i could come up with is that it's just disabled because people use it to impersonate GMs, with "G M" or "G NN" and all that.
---
From the things u listed, but somehow refuse to acknowledge.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-spot
---
Learn children
---
**G-spot**
---
The G-spot, also called the Gr√§fenberg spot (for German gynecologist Ernst Gr√§fenberg), is characterized as an erogenous area of the vagina that, when stimulated, may lead to strong sexual arousal, powerful orgasms and potential female ejaculation. It is typically reported to be located 5‚Äì8 cm (2‚Äì3 in) up the front (anterior) vaginal wall between the vaginal opening and the urethra and is a sensitive area that may be part of the female prostate.The existence of the G-spot has not been proven, nor has the source of female ejaculation. Although the G-spot has been studied since the 1940s, disagreement persists over its existence as a distinct structure, definition and location. The G-spot may be an extension of the clitoris, which together may be the cause of orgasms experienced vaginally.

The biggest issue people have is that there is basically just only one gamemode. 2vs2 is different gamemode so exactly solves this issue. We also know that 15vs15 should be in works and that swiss system should be in works. 
---
But anyways, I agree that it won't solve all the problems. The biggest problem is current playerbase's attitude and no patches will change that.
---
People are happy to pay for the things they want directly. Not from a randomised chest that means you can buy 50+ keys and not get what you wanted and certainly not when they release a bypass purchase and pretend it‚Äôs a favour to the player. 
---
We‚Äôd also happily buy expansions but it‚Äôs anet themselves that keep trying to kill them.
---
I haven't experienced getting messaged by a GM personally, but I remember a friend posting a message where they got messaged while afk farming a couple years ago. The text that they send is not purple but instead like a light green to differentiate it from a regular whisper.
---
Cool, nice research!   
---
However if this is to put the raptor ahead of the jackal in speed, it's usually not the case because the jackal teleports uphill and the raptor's leap gets shorter as the hills get steeper.
---
Guard greatsword 3rd attack also always had the might proc. Mace always had the heal on the 3rd hit. I can't remember what sword 3rd attack was. But I think it was a stab that was stronger than the hits before.
---
Warrior sword 3rd hit always had cripple. Axe 3rd hit always was the stronger triple hit. Mace 3rd hit always applied weakness. Hammer 3rd had aoe, not only cleave, great sword 3rd was a stronger hit.
---
This wasn't added later on. Just because you didn't care about boons or condis back then doesn't mean they didn't exist. The only real exception was ranged weeapons, which to this day *mostly* stands.
---
There were always payoffs. You were always rewarded for landing the third hit.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The reason why you feel like the third hit is more rewarding is because of ways to increase boon duration, quickness and the fact that at launch condis were absolute trash and you really should not have bothered going condi damage.
---
skyscale is very good to travel uphill
---
So first, sPvP is completely separate. In it you have access to all traits, specializations, skills, etc that you have unlocked (with expansions). You‚Äôll still need to unlock some runes/sigils for a one time fee of 5g and I you‚Äôll need to have the weapons you want and armor (level and rarity of both doesn‚Äôt matter). So if you wanted you could join sPvP on a level 1 character in white gear and be the same as a level 80 in full exotics.
---
WvW does take your character the way it is but will up level you to 80 (should be 80 before jumping into WvW for real though since the up leveling does not make up for missing gear and skill/traits/specs). 
---
[Crafting is pretty easy to level](https://gw2crafts.net/), especially 1-400. 
---
Legendary weapons/armor are the same stats as ascended but have visual effects and can change stats out of combat. The new legendary sigils/runes are not worth it for the cost right now but armor and weapons can be very useful if you will use that stat and rune/sigil swapping.
---
I‚Äôd suggest focusing on WvW or PvE to start and getting at least one build set up (at least exotics)
---
Mhm I'm not trying to compare the two on which is overall better or not (i actually prefer jackal over raptor heh), I'm just stating the numbers, numbers that I've been looking all over for. Thought it'd be nice to share not only the leap distances but also this method of measuring distances accurately and easily.
---
Couldn't agree more. A version of the [Guild Initiative Headquarters](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Initiative_Headquarters) that you could decorate would be such a fantastic option.
---
Thats exactly why ANet and many others have really low communication.   
---
Things get out of hand and we know people are starting to call them liars very unfairly.  
---
So in this cases no communication is a win-win.
---
The reason I have stopped doing PvP is how people simply start to doom and gloom when your team does not win the first fight or something is different. Also they know that Anet wont lift a finger to clean the toxicity even partly so they just run rampant. Even in its current state, with no change to the game, I would still pvp if Anet did something about afkers, cheaters, overly toxic people and so on
---
I'm not a huge mirage player myself, but you can start learning the class using the [simplified rotation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_6kZ2QXSxo&amp;feature=youtu.be).
---
The fanboys downvoting you hard. I wont suggest an MMORPG for someone searching for competition. There's plenty of games nowadays that fully focus on that. The MMO players that are left are mostly casuals in their 30s that don't have the time to spend in-game so their main interaction is to open their wallets from time to time when new shinies are introduced.
---
I would add that WvW in the eu is not really dead in the evenings/prime time.
---
So is the us in many cases and they don‚Äôt seem to give a fuck.
---
Can confirm, though you gotta make sure you're in a competitive server.
---
Unless there's an Open PK system. Toxic pvp people in the open world world would be a rarity. I see you're not interested in duelling, which is fine.. but you're making it sound like no one else should be allowed to enjoy it.
---
If you're afraid of being called a pussy in DMs, get off the internet. cause duels or not, you will meet that in guild wars 2 as well.
---
Thanks a lot
---
ah i see yes it makes much more sense to follow a random user than it is to rely on the actual developers to be forward with that info. Since you follow him so much when are Alliances and the next Raid coming out?
---
They have yellow whisper name, GM's can even whisper  if you've turned off whispers in your chat, They have access to your language choice preferences and there's a variety of languages spoken by people in Support

How do I get the guild armor? Do I need to join your guild for the Emblem?
---
Jackal is faster if the terrain isn't flat
---
He‚Äôs not really a random user.
---
Necromancer is not close to tank nor healer and are usually always first target in a teamfight.
---
It is definitely more than 7% loss of dps and also the "65% more hp" isn't really as big as it sounds because guardian base hp are usually just enough to take 1 big hit, 65% more won't make it past 2 hits anyway.
---
No actually they are going to classic WoW

Hey, yes the guild armor is something you can buy on every guild hall or at the lion's arch. For the emblem the guild armor will automatically show the emblem of the guild you represent. You can creat your own guild or join my. I've done the guild alone so you can do it too it's easier today or you can became the 3rd member of the Black Templar guild :D.

Fera and Kaym got ambushed by a flock of harpies. The duo managed to fight off the sky hags. Fera got hit to head during the fight and lost consciousness. Kaym then run quickly carrying his comrade back to camp. Fortunately Fera's injury were not serious but it did give Kaym a scare.

First of all dungeons are no longer developed by Anet and stand as they are or were back then.
---
I¬¥d recommend you to open a lfg your self if you want to do some. The group will fill up fast.
---
For Fractals things canged quite a bit. There are now 100 Fractal levels. Devided in 4 Tiers (T1 1-25; T2 26-50; T3 51-75; T4 76-100)
---
and they have better rewards the higher you go.
---
In the lfg they refer as t1,t2,t3,t4 fracs. Mostly you will see lfg T4 dailys.
---
In your achievementpanel under daily you find the daily fractals that are up for the day and give extra loot boxes.
---
You need 150+AR to survive the agony ticks in T4. This is easy to get for you because you already have full ascendant gear. Just buy some +10infusions of the tp.
---
Then there are 2 Challangemode Fractals 99 and 100. In the lfg they refer as CM¬¥s or 100CM or 99CM.
---
Groups will search for experienced players for these two because they are much more challangeing than normal t4s. So they will require you to post KP wich stands for Kill-Proof. 
---
100cm endboss Ark drops these things.
---
99cm hasnt realy KP besides a title you get after your first kill.
---
I¬¥ll recommend you to go on https://discretize.eu/  for in depth guids for every fractal and for builds aswell.
---
Also there are Raids you can get into. They are 10man.
---
For Infos on Raids look at https://snowcrows.com/
---
Have Fun!
---
Bouh ouh ouh, I can't be made responsible for my choices, someone else has to pay for it.

Skimmer only master race, here!

Tybalt, recap.

Yes, commander.

Thanks.

a single map thats only usable in customs, ah yes.

There is not much to carry back from that encounter.

I'm not talking about people who misinterpret. I talk about proper mental people [that have no grasp of reality](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cn93hj/quick_note_about_mist_lords_weapon_set_also/ew8dycj/) anymore or, like [in this very subthread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cn93hj/quick_note_about_mist_lords_weapon_set_also/ew8j48w/), get explained that they've misinterpreted and would still rather believe that what they *think* you meant is what you *actually* meant. Because getting told that no, that was a misunderstanding, isn't enough to convince them.
---
just rub their pelvis

qt!

Or whack the crap out of them. That should get them up and running.
---
Crafting in this game is by far one of the easiest I have ever seen.
---
Neither is it with GM or Gangsta.
---
Wonder if he's getting downvoted because burgermutts are offended by anything sex-related.
---
This is GREAT! I don't really play the game anymore but I can almost feel the story behind this image.this is like a webcomic or manga come to life. Would be super detailed for most haha.
---
I feel like I'd read it from your short description.
---
Nice find!
---
Ty i do not like them so I can skip as a whole. But at least they added something
---
Definitely not true.
---
Every aa chain at the very least had a third striked that was different.
---
At most there were aa chains with 2 skills with the same effect (though generally the second effect was stronger than the first).
---
Guardian sword even had a aoe effect where it shot out projectiles on the third hit [as seen here.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sword_Wave)
---
I clearly remember them reducing the frontloaded damage of that particular aa chain, because it just wasn't worth to go for the long animation of the third hit.
---
The evidence can be seen on the wiki.  Whatever you think of clearly wasn't the case originally. Otherwise I request you to provide evidence via a link, not anecdotal evidence.
---
Yes, they tweaked numbers so applying the third hit has a better reward, however they did not add completely new benefits to the third hit. They only tweaked numbers (aside from the torment update, where they added torment on the third hit of a weapon iirc).
---
The only time I remember when they replaced an autoattack with a 3 hit chain is on Guardian staff, however that didn't have an aa chain to begin with.
---
Aand I forgot to upload the mp3. Will do after work tonight
---
Man, you're gonna have me googling how to make origami dinosaurs. I have things to do today that do not involve prehistoric paper crafts!!
---
Eh. Two minutes is literally 120 seconds. You don't even get to make 2 plays with some of the skills due to their cooldown with such limitation, not to mention that the sword's double-edged - warrior will become pretty much like a baloon with a hole poked through it without sustain through healing, for examps, Weaver will suck. Imagine playing thief in stealth for 2 minutes and then just instagibbing people after healing's gone.
---
I drew this to make trough my own depression. I never though you had plaque signet on.
---
The problem is due to anets poor development and neglect of the mode. If anet start putting resources into it and showing they know what the issues are and are trying to rectify them then I will congratulate them.
---
I did swoosh again did I?
---
What is real? Can you tell?
---
Hail ancestor of Dorn. I'm cosplaying as pre-heresy Bjorn the Fellhanded, son of Russ! A fine work on your battle brother.

I don't know what you mean with Swoosh.

oh yh bro the recent shootings in america made trump say it again
---
I'm not arguing semantics. I genuinely don't see how to interpret what you posted differently.
---
&gt; Wonder if he's getting downvoted because
---
My guess is it‚Äôs the condescending tone mixed with the confidence that they know the reason?
---
&gt;G NN
---
If anyone fell for that, they deserve to be scammed.
---
When your reinforcements on Isstvan have more spikes on their armor than you remember...
---
I don't know I am in plat and I've would have realisiert someone going the same route over and over again is a bot. Already found bots in wvw and it's easy to tell the difference. Na or eu?
---
If you don't pay attention you likely won't notice. They do attack players and do a rotation but they also follow a very strict path, never move before game starts and occasionally get stuck on foefire gates.
---
If you play in the night, it's very common to get at least 1 in your game, Usually people know who they are. Max I've had so far on my team is 3, They all walked back and fourth into foefire spawn gate for the entire game.
---
You can also tell there are bots by the sheer amount of games these accounts have each season - It is physically not possible to stay awake 24hours per day, everyday for the entire season.
---
[It's been an issue for a while](https://clips.twitch.tv/PeppySweetLEDBCouch) and [Anet even confirmed once they was working on getting rid](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/18356/bots-in-pvp) but it seems since then the bots have only increased.
---
smh, gamers can't catch a break, sheesh
---
I have no clue who you get down voted when your post is accurate and true. People on this reddit really need to get their shit together because lately they down vote things that have fact to support it.
---
If video games could make you violent, GW2 would have given me a sense of fashion.
---
EU
---
More guns will solve it. Easy.
---
I pass, this topic has been discussed to death like 10 years ago.
---
There is no cap on hearts though so you can just repeat them on all characters.
---
Since you can't really damage enemies I recommend using GS. 3 is a long range leap with evade that can help you escape and 4 can block all ranged attacks for its duration. 
---
Apart from that, you can try to set some mobs to attack others. Often enough if you can get a mob to attack another (has to be a different type of mob) for a while, then they will just stop chasing you and fight it out. Its a bit harder than it looks, as you need the chasing mob to hit the other mob without being hit
---
We usually play full clerics nowadays in our guild.  
---
Also Shield for protection application, CC and additional blast (stealth/group superspeed).
---
Enemies very often open with around 5 warrior bubbles and the scourge corrupt usually resets boon time before concentration has an effect. We investigated this with ArcDPS log function and group-wise boon uptime with two different scrapper builds (cleric/minstrel). Furthermore the total heal of the cleric-scrapper was always higher by 10-20% in &lt;30s as well as \~3min fights (ArcDps total heal at end of fight).
---
The disadvantage is of course having only 700 vitality (13k HP). However, since toughness is still pretty high (\~2k), you delay 20% of incoming direct damage and condis are cleansed immediattely, you still stand longer than your firebrands.
---
+25/char/day from hearts.  You could probably finish within one reset now.
---
Nah they got it all wrong. Games help me to not kill everybody after a long day at work.
---
P/P daredevil with the dash dodge, I just like zooming around the map

Aah so that's what I am doing wrong...

Missing the joke or meaning xD
---
A warning for you: A new cpu or new gpu that is too good for your pc can result in a bottleneck for your new cpu or gpu giving you way less performance than you would expect, in some cases even less then before the upgrade.
---
Yep. Because a recent mass murderer's stated reasons were almost word for word Trump tweets and Tucker Carlson editorials. They had to spin that shit hard. Though "Viddeya gaemz!" makes a lot more sense than Carlson's "White supremacists aren't real."

&gt;  GW2's story wins in the accessibility department.

Not all JPs are here. Loreclaw Expanse can be reached but sometimes it instance downs you. Sometimes you it let's you get the chest. It's a little random. There are probably other JPs I missed too. And several of these JPs can be accessed using other mounts/methods. This is just showcasing skyscale/bond of faith skips.
---
Yeah that's why I decided not buy that GPU, figured it would bottle neck if it did work.
---
FX 4130 is a weak processor for GW2.  Lot of people have struggled to get good performance out of it because it has weak single core performance.  I would save up a bit more and get a mid-range Ryzen setup with a new motherboard and some DDR4.
---
oh yeah that's true. thanks :D
---
Radiant Arc tooltip has an accuracy of 99,77% then. Is the tooltip rounded up for all skills, or is it just an oopsie? Would be interesting to test on other movement skills.
---
I see your siege turtle and I raise you one Kurzick Juggernaut
---
This game was the first MMO I've seen that doesn't push players against each other in PvE. When I joined back in 2015 I was shocked to know there was no kill stealing with last hits.  It actually promotes friendly behavior, like when you rub a downed stranger's back like "it's gonna be ok" and revive him.
---
I accidentally shot my cow in minecraft
---
Did it take long to figure all these out?  I love doing jumping puzzles the old fashioned way, but it's fun to see new methods.
---
Also, what is the music at the beginning?  Sounds a bit like Sunshine.
---
i NEED ALL of that armor... what is it?
---
The one above and then mote lore nerd types
---
;) Depending on the game you might of not seen any performance improvement with a new GPU due to being CPU bound. A 650 should be powerful enough to run most, if not all MMO's on low and/or some mixed medium settings. 
---
MMO's are mainly cpu bound so it best to go look at the first. When I went from a 680 to a 1080 I saw no improvement in GW2.
---
How dare you sir/ma'am. Also Elite Kurzick armor &gt; Elite Luxon armor
---
I didn't ever said it was GW2 specific, though? Though, admittedly, Warframe doesn't seem to have that sort of issue despite big releases being years apart. Mainly because DE is very open about what to expect and don't get shifty when things get delayed, there's no air of frustration and they still provide good, repeatable things to do, like Nightwave and w/e.   
---
Again, if it works for you, more power. Never said anything about including the entire playerbase in my statement, I just umbrella'd people who'd share the sentiment - "us" - and unfortunately we exist.
---
Definitely upgrade your entire system. Even the most mid range GPUs of today will be heavily bottlenecked by that CPU and it's RAM accordingly.  
---
Your monitor is most likely 60hz, maybe 75. All in all, it's your basic model that won't require you to heavily invest in a higher tier GPU like 120/144hz+ monitors would or 1440p/4k/ultra wides etc.  
---
I recommend a 4 core 8 thread cpu by AMD. Price/Performance is unbeatable. Ryzen series obviously.  
---
You won't need more and will have best bang for buck.  
---
Look for a mobo with 4 RAM slots and slap in 2x 4GB for best performance while at a budget.  
---
Later add in another 2x4 GB for the coming 5 years at least.  
---
Or get a mobo with 2 RAM slots, slap in 1x 8GB and another 1x 8GB later.  
---
You can get CRAZY good deals on RX570/RX580 cards. as low as $120. That's unmatched performance for your buck and will suit you well for years.  
---
Coming from an FX4130 with a GTX 650, you're gonna take a tremendous step forward and won't have to spend a whole lot to do so.  
---
Good luck!
---
If you're not sure if your PSU can handle the extra load, a [GTX 1650](https://www.newegg.ca/gigabyte-geforce-gtx-1650-gv-n1650ixoc-4gd/p/N82E16814932151) with no 6 pin is a solid choice. If your rig can handle 1 6pin, an [RX 570](https://www.newegg.ca/sapphire-radeon-rx-570-100412p4gocl/p/N82E16814202283?Description=RX%20570&amp;cm_re=RX_570-_-14-202-283-_-Product) will be a better buy
---
I like all of the data in this post and I'm going to trust that it is accurate because I don't have time to double-check and I don't think you would intentionally lie about it after putting in so much work.
---
Anyway, I think they biggest problem with trying to use data for this is people's problem with gem store skins is always going to be subjective. If Anet hasn't released any in game rewards they like and a bunch of stuff they had to buy on the gem store that they liked (or had to miss out on), that person is going to feel like Anet favors the gem store.
---
Anet obviously favors the gem store for mount and glider skins. On one hand, I don't mind those skins being on the gem store. However , I do want at least some of those to be available in game as interesting rewards. Especially they much less impressive mount skins that are just used to pad-out the RNG mount boxes.
---
The problem with rewards also goes into what is actually available to earn in-game, as most items you get are just junk you salvage to either craft something, or sell to buy something. That's boring game design.
---
If someone thinks that furry abomination looks good I can tell ya they don't have a sense of fashion
---
I don't care if you exist. That's not my issue. We ALL know you exist. But you assume that you're some kind of majority, that because you exist you have to right to imply you know how many of you there are. But you don't know. No one does. It doesn't matter how loud the noise is, or how many people you hear saying it because confirmation bias exists. The most strongly you feel something the more things you're going to see to support it. That's human nature.
---
Implying that you can say anything you want because you exist is wrong. You can't know the percentage of veteran players that are unhappy. You can't speak for all the veteran players period. I'm not telling you not to have an opinion. I'm telling you to state it as YOUR opinion.  If you feel like saying many of us thing, a lot of us thing, but you don't get to speak for veteran players, no matter what you've heard in map chat, no matter how strongly your feelings are.  I don't either. No one does.
---
&gt;I would be unsurprised if Season 5 launched with another explosion of &lt;insert new thing they can monetize&gt;. Chairs certainly have not been the new hotness. I have no idea what they can do that can match mount skins.
---
I thought about this for abit too and the only thing I could think of are companions similar to WoW:Legion and then they put them in ugly ass gear and force skins onto gemstore.
---
Idk what else you can do really. Maybe allowing minis to battle? There is already so many ingame though.
---
god damnit. just last night
---
&gt;I hope no one figures these out. or if they do they're smart enough to keep their mouth shut
---
invisible walls / enormous no-fly-zone expansions in 3... 2... 1...
---
I'm sorry but the simple fact that are zero in-game mount skins to earn is just bad and a bit sleazy.  And there are what?  3 glider skins?  All tied to the legendary back pieces.  Chairs are the most fair since you can earn 4 in game: basic chair, Dhuum's throne, pile of gold, ahdashim throne.  They have the highest ratio of earnable in game to gemstore.  But a big fat zero for mounts is pretty shit.
---
Kind of Looks Weird.
---
Ooh, good, im already running a variation of the shatter mirage so that helps, thank you!
---
Haha, yeah, right, tell that to one of the most core traits (might makes right) which gives you sustain numbers on par with running defense because Magebane Tether and fast hands with courage sigils. Not the point, though - 5 or 10 is a bloat, 3 or 3 and a half is enough. I also just think it should have some secondary mechanical objective you can do, rather than just going "Okay, time's up, let's flood the arena with death gas and remove mechanics from builds!". Not only that, but in a pretty much fight-oriented gamemode, I kind of want engaging and cool fights, not shit that'll end in seconds like I get in conquest anyway because damage numbers are through the roof on anything. Much to ask?
---
Strangely enough, while HoT has loot boxes and caches like those in PvP and WvW tracks, the ones from HoT do say they are affected by magic find.
---
They never added the message in those to the older WvW and PvP tracks loot boxes and caches.
---
I apologise I'm not knowledgable with politics, I just remember seeing a clip of Trump saying it is all
---
So the HoTs caches from PVP and WvW are affected by magic find after all?
---
I may mention the skips I know to guildies but I generally dont broadcast them because I dont want the skips nerfed.
---
I love the aestethics of the S/D core thief build (sPvP meta build), but rightnow I play a staff DareDevil. I do play it with many defensive traits and mostly marauder gear.

There's a female norn who says she's working on creating a fishing association 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Agetha
---
Agetha's angling club.
---
She just needs a lot of wood to build a boat. 
---
This may mean ANet has at least considered boats and fishing at some point.
---
The city floats above the water upon the back of Bubbles McSteve, the deep sea dragon.
---
My guess is that they have the gemstore team make a bunch of skins well in advance of release of a new feature, they flood the store with a few options for the first quarter or two, and then they plan to settle into a comfortable, sustainable cadence after that. 
---
That is, my guess, why we're seeing a decrease in skins across the board right now; the gemstore team is probably hard at work making whatever new thing is coming next, and we're gonna get another spike when LS5 releases.
---
I hate JPs and Goemms lab was soooo long.
---
Using this vid I was able to park my mesmer there at least so now friends don't have to endure the puzzle if they don't want to :D
---
pvp is nothing without competition , and competition left gw2 some years ago
---
Even if they encase all JPs in invisible walls, there's still a way to skip/go through invisible walls. Even if they double the no mount/no glide range you can still get to these. I'd be more mad at ArenaNets method of fixing these things than people posting them. Someone posted some of the skips with other mounts over a year ago and they have not been fixed. Stuff like this will get posted sooner or later. Might as well let people enjoy these now. I doubt they will do anything. Invisible walls are more likely, but adding no-fly zone only hurts the game imo. They need a better solution.
---
shut up they're beautiful &gt;:c
---
Adding rewards based on tier would make high tier servers a shitshow for queues and leave everything else barren.
---
What is inaccurate, though? Pick one and sit down, dude, it's "disgrunted people exist and we know they exist", or "I don't care, and you're wrong because I don't care, so I go on lengths to prove it in some backwards way despite not caring so hard I've repeated it like 4 times already"?   
---
Not only that, I also pointed out that I wasn't making any sort of "ALL VETERANS" statement anywhere and at any point, and just referenced similar opinion-havers. What \*\*are\*\* you trying to argue, again?
---
No it's a valid point to want longer 2v2s but then I think best of three should not be the case (just takes too long then).
---
Lets be honest, ideally there would be several variants of 2v2 up to 15v15 and ctf etc. all individuelly circulating as seasons for ranked and being permanent in unranked (+please add asc shards as reward here). However anet is slow and sees too little revenue from pvp so...
---
I'm fine with any additional variant and I could think they could have gone a lot worse. I like the quick pace this will bring. However this is all pointless without que, latter and rewards.
---
Nice :-)
---
You commented on my comment, on my argument. Again we all know disgruntled people exist. Disgruntled people in this game have existed since the introduce of ascended gear just months after launch. The launch of HoT saw a lot of disgruntled people. The content draught after HoT saw a lot of disgruntled people. This isn't anything new. 
---
Where did I deny disgruntled people existed? I only said no one is allowed to talk to for veterans feel this. You want to say some veterans feel this fine. It's all I've said. You're the one who replied to me, remember?
---
* in-game reward: literally clown weapons
---
* gemstore set: badass highly-detailed weapons with cool effects
---
* in-game reward: old skins wrapped in bright gift paper
---
* gemstore set: shiny highly-detailed weapons with lots of particles and trails and sounds
---
* in-game reward: bamboo sticks with some straw
---
* gemstore set: even more badass highly-detailed weapons with cooler effects
---
Yet this would still show as parity on the graphs. Those can't differentiate between quantity and quality.
---
Yeah, never once they've said it's going to be a thing that is not another hot-join exclusive, ergo dead.   
---
Unfortunately. I'd very much enjoy potential new build options for exactly 2v2s, where you build things to synergize or with less glass-cannon-ing in mind. It could give some specs that get a shaft at conquest a place to shine and prosper, make PvP more interesting overall.
---
&gt; Cute, but eventually you'll be bitching with us
---
That's what you said. You didn't say all veterans. You say eventually they'll be bitching with us. A statement implying that if you've played the game a long time, you'll find fault and you'll come here and complain.  I mean that's pretty clear. You didn't say all veterans, you simply said this would happen.
---
You think that's somehow better?
---
I just found out yesterday I can leave my starting Norn region...
---
So helpful!
---
Yeah, that's what brought it up this time.
---
For a while there, it looked like maybe people were starting to believe science when study after study said "Nothing to see here." Then Trump needed something to blame that wasn't funding his campaign, and he decided gaming was for nerds who don't vote.
---
Now here we are again. Science has known for years that there's no real link between violent video games and violent actions (though some people are more annoying for a short time after playing them). But as with climate change, the facts don't matter to the Commenter in Chief.
---
Okay quick pause, I'm getting confused, did you think I'm two different people or something gets mixed up here
---
The first post in this entire sub-thread was yours. It's the one I first replied to. Read  what it says. It has you saying that eventually this guy will be complaining like us. That's just not necessarily the case. All veterans are not complaining.
---
enemies don't regenerate in combat. if they are regenerating, it means you've kited them beyond their patrol area, so they'll regen and walk back to their designated area before u can fight them again. to remedy this, left click your target from VERY far away, then press f1 so your pet attacks it and draws the aggro. once your pet has secured the aggro, longbow spam that enemy to death. you'll definitely want to engage enemies one at a time tho, cuz with that lvl difference u pretty much get 1 shot by everything
---
it's not a bad idea to complete the starting areas of all races. it will give you enough leeway in levels to explore other areas with a higher degree of safety.
---
ait, read my own post even  
---
\&gt;  At least you're having fun while it lasts for you.   
---
and repeat my statement - if it works out for you, it's cool either way, have your fun

Hello from a fellow disabled gamer, and welcome to guild wars! &lt;3   
---
If your left hand is mostly functional, can you use a left-handed gaming mouse?

FFXIV encourages you to help each other because everyone gets equal credit.

And by encourages you I mean it‚Äôs part of the tutorial. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong, I‚Äôm just saying GW2 isn‚Äôt the only one.
---
I welcome you attempting to adjust the numbers for quality. I do not think it's as universal as you claim. For every Zodiac or Soaring weapon set, there's a Gallant or Improvised weapon set that is almost universally panned (and yet, some small niche of people really like the Gallant set for its simplicity). I personally **love** the Reqiuem and Elegy armor sets more than most outfits or gemstore armor (though Zodiac armor is still in my favorites, years later). 
---
I called it even. I'm fully aware others wouldn't do the same, and for those people the gemstore would probably rankle them more than it does me. These data don't tell you how you should feel, merely what is objectively true about the frequency of gemstore output over time.
---
Hmm also eu, time probabbly is it then. Also my matches are lower every seasons because I can't see conquest anymore.
---
It's exhausting to feel like lootbox drops are "replacing" in-game rewards.  I... just sort of stop, look at things like the [Aspect Master's Greatsword](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/86f46MTX_AspectMastersGreatsword.png) or the [Pyre Gloves](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ffed8MTX_PyreGloves.png), and ask myself when the last time we got a similar quality non-legendary reward was?  The "Design a Weapon," skins? Favor of the Collosus, Eclipse, Scion's claw...

I think before micro-transactions took over the gaming industry these sorts of skins were what players would pursue as a boss chest or a dungeon chest; they might have like a .0003% drop rate or something silly like that, but players still pursued them.  I really enjoy how accessible cosmetics are in GW2, but when cosmetic rewards in GW2 feel like "Legendary or Bust," it .. saddens me.  
---
Gaming as a whole, not just Guild Wars 2, is in a "Black Lion Meta," where players are slowly realizing that "[uncommon drops,](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/9/98/Starborn_Outfit.jpg)" are not rewards.  They're **transactions**.   I've acquired several of the uncommon black lion drops this past year.  Then this realization hit me that *nothing* I get in-game is ever going to come close to what's offered in the gem-store unless it's legendary because whole niche of loot-boxes is to provide better value-perception than you'll get anywhere else in the game.
---
Seconding this. And I can also confirm the Ryzen 5 3600 runs GW2 like a dream. 
---
I have an RX580, R5 3600, 16GB of 3200mhz DDR4, and a 600W PSU and it runs GW2 like a champ. 
---
Lions arch will still dip to like 45fps at 100% max settings, but basically every other map will hang out at 60fps without a hiccup. I frame limit to reduce heat, I know it can exceed 60.
---
I agree and it makes plenty of sense.  Do a few easier/cheaper skins and then spend a few weeks polishing them up so they are ready to drop right after the new feature is launched.
---
I hope for their sake, they are ready to blow us away on the 30th.  I'm not going to hype myself up though.  Its been rough since PoF release.
---
Will I be level 80 by the time I complete my region? Or do you usually finish earlier? I kind of wish I had explored other areas while I was lower level (I‚Äôm level 19) because now the experience won‚Äôt be much for farming and exploring. I tend to get tired of my area. It‚Äôs all snowy hills.
---
bro,go to any map in this game and 95% ppl using RAPTOR.  rest is between rest of the mounts,you can puke 1000000 reasons why YOU think jackal is better,but in reality,RAPTOR is best to go mount,if you wana FIGHT and MOVE QUICKLY for short time.... events and shit.
---
i play ff14 too but based on my experience, gw2 players are more helpful, whereas ff14 players are friendly but its every man for himself. ask in novice network for help and no one will reply, say something silly and everyone joins in.
---
gw2 ask for help in mapchat and a whole squad will come.
---
Its not about the number, its about the quality and effort in acquiring them. Lets take a look at the weapon sets from episode 1 and 5 .. the weapons look average at best but require a crazy effort to get the fully "upgraded" versions. Meanwhile, if you get the BLC skins when they are cheap, there are much better deals. The BLC weapons usually are better looking and even cost less .. at an average of 55G release price, only takes you 2 hours to get one (takes you around 2 hours to get 55G). Where is the sense in this ..
---
Just rub thier tummy!!

You just press the dismount button and hit the mount skyscale button. Or keep pressing the mount skyscale button and it will dismount you from the skimmer and then right after put you on the skyscale.
---
Sir.
---
And that's debatable. XD
---
The XP is the same - dynamic scaling means you get the same % from doing the same activity on your level or below it.
---
Is this still allowed by anet? It seems that the account of Chris that allowed this to start has been deleted.
---
Many, many times. I am aware of the crashes and hope that they'll be fixed. These have been introduced sometime this year.
---
One of the biggest things is him mentioning the template for LS.  If Anet would stop just copy-pasting the new map, hearts, currency, etc. style then they would have plenty of resources to use elsewhere on the game.  They would have devs able to work on PvP, WvW, raids, and fractals.  The teams already in those departments would get a lot more help to get releases done in timely manners.  LS can stick to telling a story without getting entire new maps.  They proved they could do it with Scarlet Briar and the changing of Lion's Arch and Kessex Hills so why not go back to it?
---
Also agree with him in Anet needing to blow us away on the 30th.  It needs to be like pre-HoT level of excitement to get people talking about GW2 again.  If they expect to keep on the same path and are just using this event to announce LS5, people are gonna pack up their bags.  You can really see the health of places like WvW decline.  One guild or commander stops playing and it has an affect on everyone else.  If you login to play against the same few guilds and they stop playing, what are you gonna do?  Out of the past 3 guilds I've been in, once the leader of the guild stopped, mostly everyone else did.  They might have come back eventually but with no new content or friends, they had no reason to keep playing GW2.
---
It is allowed, Anet doesnt have problem with most addons.
---
Ture, multiple ways to skip these/do these faster. Just showing ways I prefer when using the skyscale.
---
Having to grind Diviner's Insignias/Inscriptions for several characters really put me off Thunderhead Peaks.  I think Dragonsblood weapons are *nice,* but they're not gem-store nice, and that equivalence is important to me.  Similar to /u/op_is_a_faglord's comment a lot of these weapons struck me as being very grind-intensive/exhausting.
---
Magnus did nothing wrong.
---
True, but that said, FF14 released after GW2, he was only saying that it was the first he saw.
---
G String 
---
XD
---
It's hard to put much faith in anything right now.  I think he's right that they'll try to sell LS5 as an expansion, but I think whether that approach reaches people is directly dependent on what features they decide to sell.  "More of the same," is not going to work well for their competitive PvP/WvW communities &amp; instanced endgame players aka frustrated veterans.
---
Good stuff, thanks my man.
---
How about this bundle?

Personally, I find the story too childish. Both narritive and writing.

Would this bundle work?

Isn't Nike the one who made a video about how you *can't* have hope any more?

Wish i had that much storage myself, but I get by with a smaller SSD =P
---
And while we're at it, let's bring raids into the present!
---
&gt;...you cannot just buy them, in a way that's a time.gate...
---
Not really. The game doesnt limit you to X amount of shovels per day like it does with some crafting items(read one per day). Or like the sky scale collection tell you to come back after the next daily reset before you can progress on the collection. While the shovels are account bound items like you pointed out and are used for guild upgrades you can buy them from other players since any guild member can contribute account bound items to the guild for upgrades or decorations.
---
&gt; I think it might be possible for this attack to repeat, but can't remember ever seeing it more than once per phase.
---
It sometimes happens to my group, so it's safer to stay away for a bit after the first spit.
---
They tend to think it'll be more immersive than it'll actually be imo.
---
These people are basically bipolar at this point, really.
---
The advantage of a nice big pc tower. Although m.2 sticks are so small that hopefully laptop manufacturers will be able to put in multiple slots in the future.

I'm usually not a fan of the Space Puppies, but I dunno, it kind of fit so well with the Norns that I went with it :)

I just really liked the idea of going stupid bulky after seeing those shoulder pads on a Norn haha

---
Yes you are just bad at the game. There is a key on your keyboard to dodge. And eith dragonhunter many buttons to heal.
---
This sub has gone off the rails.
---
RX 570 is $150 and would be a huge upgrade
---
Because the way the story is written and presented it makes it extremely difficult to like any of the characters or feel any investment in the overall plot.  There's also not a compelling villain.  The villains in GW2 are just giant dragons that the game never really takes the time to delve into their inner workings.  We got a tiny bit with Kralk but that's it.  The characters are very prescriptive and have little emotion.  They jump around with their feelings so much they feel fake as if each episode they rewrite the characters from scratch to fit the plot and that's a problem.  Who the characters are should drive the plot, not the other way around.  If the commander is some ruthless thug then the plot should follow that line.  With GW2 it's like "okay, the commander is some brute but for this episode we need him to be soft" so they make him soft and have 30 seconds of his "transition."
---
I think back to games in the Tales series or Warcraft lore or Xenoblade and the overall story may be on par or even worse than GW2 but the characters are much much much better.  You feel an attachment to them, you can feel their emotions and understand them so when something happens to them you are attached and it affects you.  In GW2 the characters are just kind of moving around doing things so there is zero attachment.
---
Joko was a good villain because he had a personality and wasn't just some big emotionless beast.  It just feels like all the characters are just wooden pieces moving along a board instead of them being well written.
---
GW2 also is horrible at world building.  Most places in the game have zero significance whatsoever.  Part of this is lack of meaningful questing and the other part is the way the Living World is structured.  We get 1 map with 2 hours, at most, of story and then it's done and on to the next map.  What Anet should have done is spend more time on existing maps with the stories instead of jumping around all over the world haphazardly.  If the collections were more quest-like and actually required you to learn and talk to NPCs that would help with world building.  Not to mention fast travel.  There is zero reason to ever go through 90% of the maps again when you can teleport literally everywhere.  I'm finishing up Tales of Zestiria right now and there is fast travel but it comes at a hefty cost to your wallet (in game).  So, you spend a lot of time traversing areas and talking to NPCs and the characters are all involved in the story.  Yes, this is a single player game, but GW2 takes less time to complete its story than Zestiria so that's not an excuse.
---
So, the overall story of GW2 may be good but the villains are empty, the characters are stiff and the world building is close to nonexistent.
---
I don't think I've used Raptor since I've gotten the Jackal. The only thing mildly useful about the raptor is the engage skill.
---
For leveling up at a decent pace, it's best to stick to areas at your own level or even 1-2 levels higher than yours. Participating in events and killing passive enemies (those with a yellow name) since those are more likely to have bonus exploration exp.
---
[This is because the experience you earn scales with your level for some things, but other things it scales with their level.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experience#Mechanics)
---
Since experience from story, gathering, defeating enemies, reviving allies and completing events scales to their level instead your character level, you'll level up faster if you stick to areas at your own level, as the bulk of all exp you'll get in the long run comes from that.  
---
For story, you can either do it as you get to the level of the missions of each chapter, or get to at least level 60 instead, then do it all in one go. Story exp along exploration and kills will give you easily enough exp to go from 60 to 80 by the time you reach the first level 80 chapter.
---
Once you get to level 80, you can go back to lower level maps to explore them any way you want, as the game scales your level down in those areas so the enemies do not become so weak they are boring and pointless, and they'll give you drops at your level. 
---
Just make sure to check your year every 10 levels or so, replacing anything 2-5 levels under your level with the cheapest gear you can find in the trading post that was Power as the main stat. You won't really need proper gear until level 80, and level up rewards will give you gear decent enough to get by before you get something better.
---
&gt; because now the experience won‚Äôt be much for farming and exploring. I tend to get tired of my area. 
---
In GW2, your level scales down to the level of the map you're in, if your level was way above it. So if you're level 80 and go in a 1-15 map, your character will be reduced to level 2-16. You still have an advantage if you have better stuff, but it's all scaled down so that content doesn't get outdated when you level up.
---
She must be very rich
---
It's fairly linear with just your area and fully completing it, you can just stick to it.  BUT some parts of the area might be more difficult or have same boring MOBs...so going to different areas might break that up.  Some people are completionists.
---
...goddammit, why is that so hilarious. I'm not laughing, you're laughing!
---
ok, ok, you got me, nice one. i should really look at the accounts i reply to more often üëÄ

Omg skyscale is not even hard to get XD I swear people are just terrible at the game.
---
Build Templates are confirmed under development.
---
My favorite legendary of ALL TIME is Ad Infinitum. I LOVE the miniature big bang everytime you go into combat!!!!
---
What kind of weird you looking for? I got weird going from a dungeon build that's sword/pistol, all the way to a perma invis Condi designed to interrupt siege in WvW weird.
---
If it's an expansion, I hope it's more like HoT or Vanilla, than PoF. HoT may have only had 3 maps at first, but they were extremely dense with lots of content. PoF was just giant maps that felt empty. Which I guess is fitting for a desert biome.
---
Would be cool if the new expansion is somewhat inbetween
---
Hey, thanks for that! [Here](https://imgur.com/a/s8zSMXh)'s my Space Puppy now with inspiration from your post. I already used the Forgeman Helmet, as /u/MarcusForrest advises, since I felt it was the closest to a Spess Mehreen :)
---
So how many have actually seen the movie that the Boogaloo reference came from? :D
---
Who traveled the furthest?
---
Griffon works better with BoF in some areas because it keeps your momentum. My favorite one to skip is the pirate ghost jp in LA, makes me feel like master chief at the start of halo 3.
---
Aaw god not this verbal diarrhea again -.-
---
Honestly just save up for a good ryzen chip with a good mobo and ram, then buy yourself a gtx 980ti off ebay for below 200 dollars.
---
Not a chance, Anet wanted you to gamble for additional dye channels at one point.
---
I hate to be this guy and I understand what you're saying, but you can obtain it through "gameplay alone" by buying gems with gold.
---
He is gonna miss his daily mate tea.

i guess we might be closer to a raid chair reward with movement functionality than a in-game mount skin
---
I use Axe/Pistol and Staff and it is fun spinning and blinking all over
---
Guns don't kill people. Bullets kill people. Ban bullets!
---
That doesn't answer anything though. And even if they do add some sort of fee for Season 5 (or parts of it), that will not really be a long-term gain but rather a small burst.
---
...no kidding.
---
&gt;Reworking old content, but mainly changing the way you obtain Elite specializations by making it a character bound "quest" that will initiate you into the guild of dragon hunters
---
No thank you.
---
Optional lore into elite specs is fine - Mandatory PvE questlines not so much.
---
---------
---
I wouldn't expect much more than "Here is living world season 5 lore and elite specs" and even the elite specs are a stretch.
---
lol @ downvotes
---
Build templates? 1 template free with a time gated collection quest or 3 for 1600 gems
---
you just made so many assumptions....
---
If all you want is pvp in mmo I'd recommend Blade &amp; Soul, it has imo the best combat *even better than BDO, I played both) and most pvp oriented mmo I know(dev supported).
---
I think I'll still be fiddling with dyes now that I changed some of the gear, which changed the textures. Also the Spinal Blades backpack is a bit cheap, but the Molten Jetpack is a bit too big for my taste, and also isn't any more dyeable haha
---
The writing for GW2‚Äôs story is pretty weak honestly... The actual gameplay of the story is really good, it‚Äôs just the writing that‚Äôs not.
---
Dumb people do, so they learn from it and improve.
---
No? I suggested potential things that they could monetize for Season 5.
---
And since you edited your original reply I will respond to that here: What other kind of cosmetic? Why would any other kind of cosmetic be better than the current kind of cosmetic? Why would it be different? Surely it would be the exact same "issue" just moved to another part of the game?
---
Or maybe, you know, a joke.
---
*Just trying to rp*
---
If every player stands inside his hitbox, it seems that he will never spit. This might not be an option if the instabilities prohibit it, and you may have to dodge the hallucination-spawning-attack if there is no aegis, but standing inside the hitbox is an alternative option.
---
Shut up, wolf sucker! RRRREEEE
---
you make a good point about avoiding friction by consistency. thanks for your input
---
Uhh, well, *technically* all cats are naked be default...
---
You're not wrong, but what I was trying to say is that it won't always be phasing the boss that causes the attack to be missed.
---
For our runs, slow CC is a bit of a non-factor: we'll phase Siax to 66% during the stun-duration in phase 1, then he (hopefully) won't have a chance to regain his defiance bar in phase 2. This means we'll only see it towards the end of phase 3. So the defiance bar never ends up "overlapping" with the spit attack and it must be something else that causes it to be skipped.
---
The only rev guard duo I know is escorting desmina through river of souls. As far as I know other than that and Matthias not many if at all bosses are duod I've seen 5 man and 4 man on most bosses, but no1 limits themselves to 1 class, most long time raiders are multiclass.
---
Clever girl.

the only way to give alacrity from range is to use salvation ventari, since orders from above has a 360 range around you, gotta have that in mind

There used to be, but with the introduction of megaservers it was deprecated.

Amazing stuff, thanks
---
I miss the sewers, one of the best things we lost from old LA :I.
---
FFXIV to GW2? That'd be like sneaking across the U.S. Mexico Border to get into Mexico, lol. Anyways, there's some good support bunker builds that Guardian can do. You can take a look at top builds at  [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Conquest#meta](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Conquest#meta) and jump in to pvp and play around from there. Have fun!
---
Well, it's mandatory to respect anyone who despises the stupid smurf legion.

Now make an army and take over the world with them.
---
Oh neat!!!
---
Funny thing is, all the trolls on T\_D and 4chan who snowballed his campaign on the internet for the lulz are probably all gamers.
---
Does it though? No one seems to make reasonable politics in the US.
---
Good Apple, Magnetic Personality and Rock Star are also very worth it, although rock star is a pretty big collection.
---
or maybe the truth, who knows. I bet there would be way more "incidents" if one would take away our games, or anime, or porn.
---
earn gold -&gt; buy gem
---
For games (and especially MMOs) it's pretty good. As someone who is a longtime book-lover though. . .
---
I think the best model going so far is a mix between expansions and Living World. So, something like 1 season per year, with 4 episodes (1 ep every quarter), for a total of 5-6 zones with different activities. So pretty much like an expansion, but delivered in episodes.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they announce a console version either, it could help the game's finances; assuming they've been working on one, of course. It would need a heavy rehash of the business model too (an optional subscription with gem store goodies would help).
---
It's actually Video games cause gayness symptom.

That's pretty good, I'll give you that.

Why are they all men?

Yes, let's contribute more to the milking of the whales. Those gems don't come from nowhere, people keep throwing $$$$$$$$$$ at them. Every time someone buys gems with gold, raises the price of the gems, so whales throw $$$$$$$$$$ to get gold.

I'll have to try it out more with griffon. I bet it gives some good launches.

"  There is not a dedicated healing role for sPvP. "  
---
Wish you would watch a single AT.

Firebrand isn't a dedicated healer whatsoever in every comp ever of comptent players. /s
---
Claiming that not liking a unicorn weapon is homophobic is, itself, rather homophobic. Especially since you don't know why I don't like it (hint: it's the sound effects).
---
The HMS Divinity is not really used enough for me to form an opinion so its in the 'neither like nor dislike area'.
---
And I'm just not a fan of 'silly' gear designs in general.
---
Man, you guys traveled the world to see each other. At least look like you‚Äôre enjoying it.
---
You can work on your gear a bit. It's probably all over the place, so getting it full rare or even full exotic would be a good start. Karma vendors sell that, they're also somewhat cheap on the trading post. make sure you don't get scammed by searching for "berserker" or something.
---
You can also play season 2 of the living story, if you bought/buy it.
---
&gt;  And I'm wondering where I should start next.
---
well what have you done so far and what have you enjoyed the most/least?
---
Oh nice, thanks. Planning to try to get thru queensdale without shooting first, then I'll attempt that
---
oh that sucks
---
Isn't the food we give them imbued with magic tho?
---
Oh interesting. Thanks
---
Oh yeah. sorry, mb
---
There is a heal thief, but it's not great outside of I think one raid boss. I guess it could potentially work as a plain healer in dungeons and open world, but it will only offer healing, no boons. I've only seen it in raids, so I can't really speak to it's healing ability in other content.
---
That build is:
---
Deadly arts 2-2-2
---
Acrobatics 1-2-2
---
Trickery 1-3-2
---
Full harriers, sword pistol, monk runes. Your heals are from skelk venom and shadows refuge and crits from water sigil. Just note, you'll fuck up any thief depending on stealth if you heal them with shadows refuge because of reveal.
---
Necro is only super tanky in PvE. In my experience, minions just don‚Äôt cut it in PvP/WvW. That being said, I still see a lot of Scourges and a fair few Reapers in PvP. Guard is decent in PvP; I do see quite a few Dragonhunters. Firebrand I haven‚Äôt seen a ton of, but then again, I‚Äôve only been playing ranked lately.
---
That being said, Druid (ranger elite spec), Scourge (sometimes), and bannerslaves are probably the most common healing and support classes PvE-wise. Chronomancers (Mesmer elite spec) are used as tanks in raids and as general support, with Quickness and Alacrity. There really isn‚Äôt a big focus around tanking and support in PvP (more so in WvW), it‚Äôs more about very bursty high-DPS builds in PvP.
---
ha ha
---
nahh it's too easy that way
---
That's so small! Did you have to use some kind of origami tool or something to make those folds?
---
Ah yes, I have no mount yet since I haven't got any expansions or level 80 haha
---
I‚Äôd honestly just farm up Pact Scout‚Äôs Mapping Materials (5k karma each roughly. 6 per day per account) for a few weeks, then consume them all on a really profitable week.
---
I'm pretty sure the enemy I'm fighting regenerates in combat seeing as under its name i see a text that says "regenerates health"
---
Maybe he wants to roleplay as a sallad before eating one?
---
They‚Äôre called stargazers, which is such a great name
---
Make use of Content Guide and disable personal story so it prioritizes nearby events.
---
But you're better off farming karma and purchasing mapping materials from Pact Supply agents.
---
Because they want to be told "No, don't contact support, keep the money, they won't notice."
---
If you want to skip the last 20 levels of leveling (not really a big deal, you get enough xp just from progressing through Orr and story at that point) you can level your character in a crafting discipline and you‚Äôll be level 80 guaranteed by the time you‚Äôre done.
---
Also, gw2crafts focuses on money efficiency because leveling a craft profession is expensive.
---
Yeah! Fuck the $$$$$$$$$ system! Time for a revolution! Down with greedy players!
---
They have dropped a lot in price
---
bunker != healer
---
donno what other mmorpgs you've played but when you have a dedicated healing role it plays out very differently than what you might be familiar with in GW2. Not to mention the only main stat +Healing Power sPvP amulets are Mender (Power/HealPower + Prec/Vit) and Marshal (Power/HealPower + Prec/Condi) which still put an emphasis on damage.
---
I would recommend waiting to see if the expansions go on sale during the anniversary before purchasing the game. The sales are happening now and historically have gone on sale during it. 
---
For PvE content, T1 fractals and dungeons will be a good place to start out
---
When I got good as a DD it was so much freaking fun, always moving always dodging never taking damage.
---
So good.
---
Ahahaha. I'vee been seeing this meme everywhere.
---
The way I see it is you do get a mount skin for playing in game.. the original. I'd rather have it how it is than pay real money for the actual mount, then also pay real money for skins, like certain other games.
---
You poor naive soul if you actually think they will.
---
When they added even the most disappointing colorswap skins in the gemstore, especially in the 1st gen RNG pack.
---
Love this picture. My guild just got together in Los Angeles last weekend. I'll have to post our group shot in our guild shirts when I get home. Thanks for sharing this.
---
Yeah, I see your point. The base game's story is very entertaining. If the presentation was on par with current releases' I'm sure it'd be quite exciting as well. But whenever it tries to build suspension it's bogged down by its stiff presentation, comical difficulty and boring boss fights.
---
I still liked HoT. S3 on the other hand couldn't build up any momentum and some of its dialogues are so cringey - it was excruciating.
---
Have you never use the phrase 'have to' in your entire life?
---
No, wait, doesn't matter. Let's assume you're from bizarro earth where no one ever uses 'have to'. Shouldn't it still be enough for you to get told by *the guy who wrote it* that this is *not how he meant it*?
---
Damn those video games... now if we could only figure out what was causing violence for all the previous thousands of years prior
---
Opportunity costs, and ease of access is the key. Almost all proposed ways to "get rich with mystic forge" require patience and/or starting capital that you effectively freeze. If the Mystic Forge UI was even remotely more bearable to regular player, all of those methods would be much less profitable. But they are not, for a reason.
---
&gt; But you're better off farming karma and purchasing mapping materials from Pact Supply agents.
---
Limited to 6 per day, they could be farming the events for the rest of that time if they wanted.
---
i didnt say "not cosmetic" OR "season 5 fee" he did, and then continued to talk down as if I was the one who suggested them. not worth talking to someone who already knows how theyre going to respond before there's an actual conversation.
---
Lol I‚Äôm a Norn and I‚Äôm getting sick of all the snow.
---
Yep. Anything to keep it business as usual while we creep slowly and steadily to our doom.
---
Are we finally mainstream enough for reposts? Woah.
---
theres nothing rewarding about that though. its just farming some irrelevant uninteresting content to make some other player pay for it with money instead of you. i want to do a collection or quest line thats related to a mount skin to earn it.
---
Really great incentive for experienced players to help new players!
---
Damn that actually sounds like it works super well. Thanks!
---
I always feel a bit under leveled in my own region when I get to the next area.
---
id take a monthly fee if it meant id get in game rewards instead of constant gem store updates. a sense of security in the content im receiving instead of constantly feeling like im being nickled and dimed, intentionally inconvenienced,  and feeling like anet is waving their tip jar in my face every time i log in.
---
From an evolutionary perspective, yes. I'd still think the guy who did the unprovoked punching was a dick and would probably seek retribution of some form just for the fact that they'd assault someone unprovoked, just like I think people who TRY to scam others should be punished. That doesn't change the fact that there will always be predatory people around you and you have to learn to deal with them and defend yourself.
---
I hardly played FFXIV because of the lack of pvp and slow story. From your taste I recommend for GW2 Guardian, Thief, Necromancer, Elementalist and Mesmer. The hardest to play can be Elementalist and Mesmer but quite fun. Necro is a glass cannon with hax...
---
Great reply thank you!!
---
Have you ever considered that ArenaNet wants people to do hero points? It forces people to engage in, practice gameplay and sometimes even socialize.
---
No problem :)
---
As you level up you get access to better food and Sigil of Energy, which gives 25% or 50% endurance bar when you swap weapon in combat (depends on quality). So I recommend you to go for both Skirmishing and Wilderness Survival, food that gives higher endurance regen and Sigil of Energy when you are higher leveled.
---
That armour is beautiful.  It'd look amazing on my max body size, max height Norn.
---
I'm on magumma.  WvW does not seem dead at all.  There are public squads on a regular basis.  Its not all day long like it used to be but its there.
---
You mean earn gold and turn it into gems to buy account upgrades like bag/bank slots and unbreakable harvest tools
---
A huge point people are often overseeing is that while an armor set counts as 18 (6 for all three armor types), a single character can't wear both heavy and light. And I highly doubt many people have multiple characters they actually spend a noticable time playing (not just an alt you log on once a week). So a person's actual outlook selection is already 1/3 of the calculated amount. But gem store outfits **can** be transmuted by everyone. 
---
So, for example, Path of Fire has 5 in-game sets:  Funerary, Bounty Hunter, Warbeast, Elonian, Spearmarshal (the latter 2 are almost the same by the way). For a single armor type that's 30 armor pieces. And gem store has 6 sets:  Kasmeer Regal, Outlaw, Champion of Tyria, Dynamics Exo-suit, Grenth's Regalia, Forged; and 7 standalone pieces:  Abaddon's Mask, Fuzzy Aurene Hat, Swaggering Hat, Storm Gloves, Foefire Mantle/Greaves/Wraps. That's 36+7=43 wardrobe items.
---
This is muuuch more exacerbated in Season 4, with only four in-game sets, 2 of which are just downgraded versions of their respecive requiem/blossoming shard armor, and 4 corsair pieces, where head and boots are the same for all armor types btw. 
---
While gemstore has been incredibly prolific: 18!! outfits and 12 offset pieces.
---
So it's 28 wardrobe items vs fucking 120 from gemstore. And seeing as this is the current development, not something that happened 5 years ago - no wonder people are incredibly tired of this bullshit.
---
Haha! This is the best version of the meme yet! üòé
---
my bad then, i don't really pay attention to those things as trash mobs die so easily. but even so their regen skill should be on a large cooldown and doesn't regen so much that it negates all the damage you've done to it.
---
if the healing is a big problem, poison significantly hinders healing, so take the "refined toxins" trait on wilderness survival to keep perma poison uptime on your target
---
That's not a reward.  That's a **transaction**.
---
You talk about quests. They will never do it but a quest system instead of a achievment system would be a big win for the game. But yeah, too late for that. GW2 went from "we dont need quests in our game" to "we make the worst possible implementation of a quest system as we need it still but wont openly say so"
---
they should, but they won't. they got way too greedy with the gemstore over the past few years, it's been getting worse since HoT really.
---
I was always confused why they didn't put 1 legendary skin in for each mount with PoF.
---
I just got my mesmer to lvl 80 and chose mirage. Now my mesmer cannot evade at all. It spawns a "clone" and then walks to the side/back. It does not evade. What have I done wrong on my build because it's causing me no end of torment not being able to evade?
---
I used Huawei Mate 20 and this is just finger painted. :) I used cheaper Huawei model for 3 years. My older posted art is made with that phone. Just have a good and undamaged screen and you are good to go. 
---
I think Autodesk Sketchbook software is the key to be able to draw with my phone.
---
it's essentially the f2p restriction on mount skins *after* we have already bought the expansion lol

What the actual fuck are you linking.

I found them rather bland but it's okay as i enjoy reading game novels in general so I had to read them anyways. But if Id be short on money I would buy something else honestly...
---
I know the feeling
---
Not anymore!

Wrong order. Source: I'm afk in LA with my headphones on.
---
Humor &gt; endless salt
---
No by edit I mean you adding everything other than this, which was your original comment that I replied to:
---
&gt; you might spoil season 5 for yourself if youre too eager to find out
---
Why are you getting so worked up about a simple question? I asked what you wanted them to monetize instead since your post made it clear that you didn't want them to monetize cosmetics.
---
this i agree with. i could easily see the first one being free to anyone with an expansion or a full core account, then you buy more up to like 4 total including the free one, one for pve, one for pvp, wvw, and raids
---
HoT launched and provided 3 legendary glider skins that crept into the game over time; Ad Infinitum, Ascension &amp; Warbringer.  These days there are many other *nice* gem-store gliders.  Legendary Mounts would have been - would be - awesome; and y'know with all the time-gating ArenaNet does (eg; Provision Tokens) I don't think it'd hurt actual mount sales all that much...
---
I didn't say it was. I'm just saying you don't technically need to pay money to get it.
---
if you can point to where i said "i want them to make new things that arent cosmetic, and i want them to charge a fee for season 5" then ill shut up entirely.
---
Its free AP if nothing else.
---
Some items are also indeed worth crafting, check gw2efficiency to find them. Jeweled Damask Patch for example is basically free gold.
---
I'll take fab cat over effect monsters any day.
---
The last several seasons have only had a two week break between them. While nothing has been confirmed yet, it will likely start on the 20th.
---
Cosmetics are not needed. 
---
Gems can be bought with gold.
---
Most mmos, charge monthly and have cash shop and offer less cosmetic in game rewards. 
---
Stop.being a whiny entitled twat.
---
Thanks. It's fairly easy to pick up when you learn what you can or cannot do. Sketchbook is not that demanding for your phone. So getting the same phone as I have should not be necessity.
---
I however recommend using class protection layer with any phone you decide to use. I used plastic layer in my older phone and has noticeable more resistance than glass has. Your finger moves a lot smoothly across the screen with glass.
---
Stack size is 250, and even counting the ones equipped, you only have 238.  Stop expecting other players to carry planks for you, and put some effort in!
---
They literally never said "no" to any of these things.
---
It's a broken reward structure.  Someone fronts the bill so that you can have a *chance* at getting what you want.  You'll never know whether the person you're buying gems from is doing so in a responsible manner or could "afford" to buy gold.  It's an ingenious system, I'll give them that, but ignorance is bliss when you get what you want, and only occasionally... perpetuates the problem.

Well.... They met in Prague and the guy from Argentina traveled the furthest.
---
His point was if you spend a few hours in Silver Waste or on the latest ls map then you can exchange the gold you earned to gems and get the mount liscense. It is not the same thing as getting it through a reward, but never the less no one ever have to be left out because you can always exchenge ingame gold.
---
why did I got attacked like this?? what is your problem dude? I was half-joking right there telling that basically you can't ever know what Anet is thinking and they can always do things they said they won't - if they want, they can go LS1 way even if they said they won't do it. That was the reading between lines you had to do to understand my comment before you did ad hominem.
---
It's not a debate, it's just an intentional diversion from real issues.
---
Where are the rods?
---
your ~~issue~~ desire to get involved with someone elses inability to enter a conversation without: making accusatory assumptions and then expecting the OP to bend to their misinterpretations,  is even more confusing. im here to discuss, you can see me doing it with other people who dont do what either of you are doing
---
RIP classic freeze guns and Reapers.
---
EU servers.
---
you made this video for Anet to make higher inv walls and fix it right? not to help other players, you should be ashamed of yourself Sir !!
---
I feel like 1 slot and having to buy more isn't releasing a functional system and monetizing addons, that's monetizing it entirely, as 1 slot by itself is pretty damn worthless. That would be like selling me a character slot that had no bag slots, I'd have to buy at least one to make it functional.
---
Sooo was any of you here when Skyscale came out and you had to work to get it and it took a while to get the reward and the shit storm that followed because boooohooo we need to work to get reward. 
---
So when you say but they could just make it as some collection, you realise that is setting up for a new shit storm from entitled people who want everything without having to do somethign that takes more then 2 min. This is what is creating issues for the game, because it does not matter how it is done there will always be a side that create a shit storm and think it is wrong which limits Arena Net for each time it happens.
---
His point was obvious.  It's a shitty point and plays into an extremely unsatisfying reward structure.
---
That was true for the most part up until Ryzen 2000 series came onto the market. Their IGPU's are significantly faster then anything Intel produced over the past decade. Right now, a Vega 8 (which is integrated into the 2200g) is on par with a 750ti. So you're getting a slight performance increase in that regard.
---
With AMD's new 5000 serie GPUs, i suggest you stick around for the lower to mid end of that series probably around September and you've got yourself best bang for buck and a significant increase from the Vega 8 GPU by then.
---
You should check out the full list of stuff.
---
Lots of nice pets &amp; effects you can get.
---
No.
---
Why do you have to be a veteran for that? I don't really get your point.
---
No.  You're reaching.  GTFO.
---
I am shocked by the number of replys here basically saying no to even a single in game earnable mount skin, even Gliders got legendary skins to work towards.
---
I use to love this game more than anything, easily sunk over $1000 into it, but now i struggle to log in outside of doing the Living Story. There is no reason for me to log on anymore, nothing to work towards, this is by far the least rewarding game i have ever played, it wasn't like this at launch, but over time it got worse and worse. I have good memories working towards my Legendary PvP wings, and i proudly wear them still today, why is it to much to ask for a single legendary mount skin to work towards? Why is that concept now completely lost to the GW2 community? Has ArenaNets greedy gem store practices whittled you down that much?
---
ArenaNet is consistently inconsistent.  Say no more.
---
The only thing childish and silly here is all the downvotes because I was attempting to make anet aware that this pack would sell more if they didn't tie certain things to expansion only stuff like shared slots and that maybe some changes might make far more sense than how they have it set up right now.
---
The only thing childish here is all the "supposedly" mature people like yourself getting their nickers in  twist because my opinion is different than theirs on this subject who then have the nerve to make posts like yours right here in some silly little defense of Anet or better yet hide like cowards behind the downvote button.
---
The downvote abuse in reddit is notorious for a reason, people like you who more than likely followed me here from another thread I posted in just to type this garbage post of yours is prime example.
---
Go read the rules again and realize this post of your had fuck all to do with my thread other than to be an asshat. 
---
Try this in the future don't waste yout time to troll and make some BS post like this to try and show how adult like you are.  as for being entitled the only ones that use this term are silly kids in this new generation try far to hard to sound like adults.

I regularly overthrow the communist regime of dredge to acquire consumable knockback rifles to employ in specifically the southern lane of Tarir while I‚Äôm already in armour as to do both jobs on my own when the situation calls for it.

---
I‚Äôm a veteran. I‚Äôve seen the first two but not the others. Obviously they would have stated these things probably ‚Äúweren‚Äôt on the table‚Äù at points in the past, but I doubt they came to the conclusion that ‚ÄúWe will never make mounts‚Äù. It was likely more along the lines of ‚Äúmounts aren‚Äôt currently planned‚Äù.
---
I hate when people say this, you even say "i hate to be this guy" implying you yourself are even aware at how problematic your statement is. That is not rewarding or fun, it is problematic and contributes to a larger problem that is destroying this game.
---
That‚Äôs super impressive! And the art is great!
---
Thanks for the civil reply!
---
Technically if I only had 1 slot I'd only be able to swap TO 1 armor set, not between. Which kind of defeats the purpose. If only 1 slot was available I'd just keep using arcdps templates as long as they didn't get me banned.

Then how DO YOU MEAN IT?
---
It wasnt about work though with skyscale, it was about the fact that it was timegated to oblivion, which again is not rewarding, if I wanted timegated content i would be playing wow right now. You can make a collection like the legendary ones where you have to go into the world and complete activities
---
Reminds me of Team Fortress 2. An all too familiar sound.
---
Seems so, it's unfortunate I as think they end up losing money in the long run and just alienating newer players.  Thanks for the civil reply btw, glad to see there are some that can reply and give their thoughts without acting like teens trying too hard to be adults.
---
Nope. 
---
People might argue it's too much of a "carrier" and it doesn't provide much apart from barrier, a few "oh shit" res buttons, and a sprinkle of boons, but they fail to realize that the purpose of a training group isn't necessarily to get a kill, but to see the mechanics and *learn*. 
---
Scourge is absolutely fine and if they say otherwise then they don't know what they're talking about.
---
I think this is amazing... keeping up with the guild... miss those days. Mine went our ways years back and I always think of them time to time.
---
The amount of white knighting of ANet's anti-customer practices and habits in this thread is really sad to see. Have some dignity and self-respect, people. It should not be remotely controversial to suggest that a game should offer at least one token in-game unlock which doesn't revolve around microtransactions.
---
Nerf Enmebaragesi pls
---
In my pants
---
right, my bad, or Anet's bad for making both a skin and a stat with the same name ;)
---
I can see it being useful in the group getting to learn more, since they get carried, and therefore they might get further into the fight and get to experience and train mechanics.
---
But that said it also takes away some of the difficulty, and therefore they don't get a realistic view of the fight, and they might end up struggling once the safety net gets removed.
---
Plus they might just get carried through the fight and get a kill, but not really learning the fight.
---
The point of a training run isn't to kill the boss after all, it is to learn it.
---
I think a few minutes is a gross exaggeration.  The fact of the matter is, the boss does take a long time, no matter your dps, its a chore to get there, and if alone will take the better part of 30 minutes to chew threw.  I agree with the OP, he's overtuned and could use better scaling.
---
I count 5 smiles, but they are all Mona Lisas.
---
RPers make me violent
---
So... That's a yes.
---
Saying they've ignored the perfectly valid and persistent demand for reasonable in-game non-gems rewards and that you'd rather they expand their approach to monetization is just a roundabout way of saying you've given up on the former demand.
---
You've been whittled down. 
---
----
---
And in the same vein as another comment has said: Cosmetic skins are the only consistent thing *any* F2P MMO monetizes. Everything else is just utility services and story/expansion packs. 
---
The industry statistics are objectively against you.
---
As players, better in-game rewards fostering happier players is consistently a better direction to devote our attention.

---
The *only* way we will ever get a new race is if it shares a model with something in the game. If they created a brand new model that players can play they would have so much work. Every single armor/weapon would have to be made to fit it x2. I would love a new race but its just not feasible at Anets dev level.
---
I hope that they won't fail, AGAIN.

Come on now.... Cosmetic Mount skins hiding behind gems aren't destroying the game. A lack of updates, communication, and content is what's doing that.

Also remember you can level 2 professions to 400 and get from 60ish-to 80 with an xp booster you'll most likely end up with by then (the 50% xp boost in all game modes one). Cooking and jewels are super easy to lvl.

Any type of overhealing/overhelping is bad for raid training. Unless the idea of raid training is to "get the kill" or you GG and redo the boss over and over telling ppl you won't kill till you get better x or y mechanic at that point, it might be better that ppl don't die to a single mistake so they can try to do better rest of the fight.

THIS IS THE FUNNIEST SHIT LOOOL

&gt; To provide a slightly less negative perspective
---
Username does not check out.
---
That's not much different from following a minimal-dialouge quest chain to get the skin though.
---
I think what people want is less *more* content and more *variety* of content.  In that sense the best thing to add would be two or three more elite specs for each class, to breathe new life into gameplay.
---
I did.  People need to realize that there are major distinctions between in-game rewards and in-game transactions. 
---
The argument that you can always buy gem-store items with gold rings hollow after a while.  The truth is that *playing* GW2 should be rewarding; not spending money in GW2's cash shop.  The "Conversion Mentality" is essentially a way for players to rationalize  buying their rewards; in other words, **monetization in GW2 is so successful that they've made spending money fun.**  
---
Rather than the game being fun, the game is now about *grinding gold,* and funneling you through various theme park rides so that you can take all those hard-won raffle tickets and ***spend them all at one place.***  You shouldn't have to **pay other people so that you can gamble on shinies** -- there needs to be a better balance between in-game offerings and gem-store offerings.  
---
In the past the primary argument has been Quantity &gt; (Flexibility) over Quality.  Within the past 2 years since PoF ArenaNet has significantly revved up the the number of uncommon black lion drops.  Things that would *never* be in the game if it weren't for the heroic and virtuous actions of the gem-store team.  Let that sink in.  Never.  In.  The.  Game. 
---
Things that you consider "rewards" (Transactions).  Someone is footing the bill -- aka -- paying for your "**purchases**."  
---
In a game without micro-transactions each theme park ride would give you something worth while.  In a game with microtransactions like GW2, things like black lion chests/uncommon drops, drastically decrease the value perception of *everything else.*  That exclusivity and deliberate removal of meaningful rewards from content is by *design*
---
GW2 wants someone to open up their wallet, buy gem and convert to gold.  
---
... because they're skimming .. by being the middleman; they profit on both parties.  
---
In other words; you're paying into the gem-store meta because nothing else looks remotely as desirable.
---
I don't think there would be as much friction as you claim. I think they could have made a compelling set of collections to find an alternate version of your standard mounts. Have them be gold sinks akin to the griffon unlock as well as truly hard challenges and you would have a prestige mount skin that people would actually be impressed by.
---
This + elite specs.
---
As well as spears for use on land either by themselves or as part of the elite specs. (coding to do so has been in game since original launch after all)
---
Como eu quero mais conte√∫do de ajuda e guia em portugu√™s *. *
---
It's a real sad and sorry state of affairs when almost all of this thread is comprised of people being downvoted for pointing out ArenaNet's anti-consumer business practises and how disappointing they are, and people parroting that same tired argument of "They're just cosmetics, they're just optional, you can buy them with gold using conversion!"
---
ArenaNet have managed to grind down their own players so badly through *constantly* disappointing them with a lack of content and lacklustre rewards *in* that lack of content that these same players now basically *defend* that bad practise, because they'd rather defend that consistency and accept mediocrity than ever hope that maybe for just *once*, ArenaNet could once again start creating content with genuinely pretty cosmetic rewards that reflect the investment you put into playing to get them. 
---
The fact that somebody asking "Hey, think you could at least put *one* mount skin into the game for me to work towards that has more than one mediocre dye channel? *Please*?" is met with such borderline revulsion from this community is actually more disgusting and disappointing than ArenaNet's own business practises that brought us to this point.
---
Cool, so it's a kind of swings and round-a-bouts deal. Lose an advantage but gain others. Thanks!     
---
     
---
Makes sense because i've started kiting like a loony = leaving doubles all over the place. Seems to work just fine if I don't expect to evade-jump. I just keep strafing and then double click to leave a double.     
---
Thank you!
---
There are endless possibilities for amazing new story arcs, if they stear away from these caracthers. Aurene had a good ending in season 4, just let her go and start something new.

Of course! Did you figure out what the problem was in the end?

Why is this so well done

I mainly play dragonhunter and alacrigade so I would still follow raid rotations. You should probably say that it depends on the profession rather than making such a large statement that raid rotations are never used in fractals.
---
&gt;they say a lot of things:
---
&gt;
---
&gt;\- no gear progression - they give us ascended
---
Ascended gear was planned from damn near day 1. Game launches in August, first ascended gear comes in November with fractals. It took YEARS to get full ascended gear released. GTFO with calling that gear progression. Everyone farmed Cursed Shore and had full exo on multiple characters within 2 weeks of launch. We've now gone 7 full years, the entire duration of the game's existence, without any additional gear tiers, and it's beyond pedantic to say otherwise.    
---
They kept that particular promise.
---
Don't forget the other perk of Mirage, after you dodge you gain access to a new skill on your auto-attack button for a second, called an Ambush skill.  Those are often potent attacks.  One of your Grandmaster traits even gives those Ambush skills to all of your clones whenever you dodge too!
---
I'm calling the police

as much as i agree with the idea that theyve avoided alot more drama by being consistent, you make alot of points that if i hadnt already spent more than $1000 supporting this game since launch, i would see as reasons not to try the game. if i was a new player reading this thread, gw2 would not sound like a very rewarding game at all, and while I don't want to stir up drama, i kinda would enjoy Anet feeling the burn of prospective new players deciding not to play because of how much quality reward-content is thrown into the cash shop. I like to have these discussions so any Anet employee scrolling through can at least see that our disappointment is equally consistent

and set up your self with the rune set that makes you go "Arrrr!"

You'll be level 80 long before you complete the entire world. But this game isn't about staying in your zone level. That is to say I often, when leveling, run four, five levels above my level, and go back later, and finish world complete at 80. Due to downleveling I'm not one-shotting everything, and there's plenty of reasons for high level characters to revisit low level areas anyway.
---
You're probably used to most MMOs where you never go back. But unless you're just a hard core raider or PvPer, odds are you'll be back to many of these zones over and over again.
---
Don't have even close to your guild's skills, but it's fun to watch y'all flying aces. Anet really made something pretty special with the griffon.
---
The problem comes in if they do manage a kill, don't recognize that they failed mechanics and got carried by a scourge.
---
And what is wrong with just playing what you want and enjoy it? i play because it‚Äôs fun to me not to earn something. if game gets boring for me i‚Äôll play something else until
---
i want to play the game again. 
---
i know whatever i‚Äôm currently enjoying in the game it‚Äôs rewarding even though i don‚Äôt know what i will get for it, that does the job for me. i don‚Äôt feel the need for long term progression if the gameplay is good enough. 
---
same as games from other genres like Starcraft, csgo, minecraft, that dont need any longterm  progression in order to be successful.
---
Can you show me where they said no raids. I'd like to see it, because even though I'm not a raid guy and don't enjoy them, I'm pretty sure that was never said.
---
They didn't say they're be no gear progression, because there was gear progression in the game at launch. Exotics are better than rares. That's gear progression. They added one single new tier of gear, because people got exotics faster than they planned. What they actually said was that they would put in no gear treadmill, and they haven't. 
---
They never said there would be no mounts in this game. The closest they ever came to saying this is when they said that the are no real reason for mounts in the game because of waypoints, which is a long way off from saying there would never be mounts. They just introduced zones with fewer waypoints.
---
They did say they didn't plan on expansions at one point, but they never said there would never be expansions. 
---
You can have all the trust issues you want. But if you actually looked at what you said, the only thing I can actually agree with you on is the trinity.   None of that other stuff that you said they said was actually said. This is you listening to what they said and hearing what you wanted.
---
üíØ perfect!
---
No i am a child of the holy gods
---
I don't think people will ask for more mounts skins that quickly, I don't hear people ask for the gen2 Leggy spear or trident, and no one complains for extra legendary trinkets. But the lines are blurred between what is in-game earned outfits and glider skins, and what is bought. Also, there is so much whack content that comes from the bought store, glyphs on harvesting tools, farming patch, salvage-o-matics. world boss portal device, mail carriers, waypoint unlocks, character/bank/inventory slot expansions. Giving us a mount skin collection wouldn't hurt.
---
Then we just have different ideas of what constitutes a different rotation. Doing some extra support stuff is sometimes needed in raids as well but aside from that one thing, the rotation would remain the same. Precasting would affect the opener but not much else in the rotation. Holding cc is something that is done in raids as well.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt;     they actually intentionally pushed toward something that wasn't so important before
---
&gt; That did not happen.
---
&gt; My point is that the payoff always was on the third hit, they just tweaked numbers so it actually felt like more of a payoff.
---
So you say I'm plain wrong, and then process to confirm exactly what I said. I won't read further (*). Especially someone who says that "my point is plain false" when the main point I tried to outline again (but you totally missed again) is an opinion and not facts, and you call "false" my statements that are still about the unimportant part (hence proving that you still missed the point) : the historical aspect.
---
(*) well anyway you apparently didn't read my comment either ...
---
This might be the best thing I‚Äôve seen all day.
---
I disagree, but maybe it's because I play story driven games
---
Gw2 story is way too rushy imo, the pacing is too fast, all the explanations are made so that you actually have to seek the lore out but your character is already well acquainted with it all
---
And also, I think singleplayer stories dont work well in mmos, if everyone is the pact commander, nobody is

since we know they are working on these, anything else is bonus. But I am not going to worked up on this at all, that will just lead to disappointment.
---
It's always been the case, the more populated the server the more expensive it costs to transfer
---
They should but they won't.
---
I always remember there being fees.  Will I guess possibly not always as I don't remember from the very beginning, but I remember from a long time ago there being different costs depending on what srver you transfer to.
---
Oh..
---
Pretty sure gem costs were introduced in 2012.
---
The only free transfer you get is when you upgrade from a free account.  All other transfers cost gems depending on the population size.
---
It was always part of the plan. The only reason the game launched with free server transfers was because guesting, an announced feature, hadn't been implemented yet. It was always the plan to charge for server swapping.
---
In fact, the only thing in this game servers are necessary for now is WvW and WVW would be complete and horribly destroyed by free server swapping.  People would just keep transferring to the highest server they could, and other servers would never move out of whatever place they were in.
---
The WvW crowded, who it affected most, hated free server switching and complained about it quite loudly at the time.
---
What kind of shirts are you wearing?
---
Are they guild shirts?
---
And what you don't see is that reducing everything in the game to a gold grind eventually just leads to the game being boring.
---
Guy on the far right with long hair looks like Vanya from AFK.
---
It's on the table

As far as I'm concerned your replies are fairly balanced even if I don't always agree with them.  You're usually not particularly sarcastic either which is a huge plus in my book.  I can have a conversation with you where we disagree about things, but don't walk away from it exceptionally bitter. It's people that misrepresent and generalize opinions like [Hinawarden](https://imgur.com/a/6e0MMzD) that really get under my skin.  Every so often when a thread is declining you get a snapshot of what people are really like when they feel no one is watching.
---
The reason that threads like mine blow up is because the community needs those sorts of AMA release valves for reassurance.  I don't enjoy writing them the slightest bit, and I almost always delete them when I think the conversation has run its course.  Something I've had to accept is that feelings aren't always fair and bottling them up is far worse for mental health.  I think it's far worse for the community to "stew" than it is to voice opinions and feelings that people are saying but are too afraid to say.   
---
Maybe it sounds stupid to you, but I'm satisfied if I can provoke some sort of response or reaction.  On some level I know that it's irresponsible to do, but I feel like ArenaNet is content to coast from episode to episode with as little communication as possible.  I want them to be more assertive and have answers for the playerbase.  8/30 is the end of the line.
---
Great great post, man I wish I could upvote you a 1000 times

Holding CC in raids is not same as burst rotations in fractals. Because of how different the two are. In fractals the CC is part of your damage rotation, because it directly increases your damage. There are classes that will weave the CC inside damage and there are classes that'll first spam CC then dmg skills.
---
Especially in a top tier group, you'll need to know exactly how much CC you need for each bar and communicate that so there is no excess CC being used which hinders next phase's bar or the dps you do on this one.
---
Raids and fractals are no comparable in this scale. I don't mean to belittle you by this but i don't think you've done fractals in a level where you can understand the difference if you can compare them this way.
---
Well you seem pretty reasonable and your responses seem pretty reasonable, so I guess this conversation is over. My own reactions come more from my own personal experience than my need to defend Anet. I'm sort of like this in every aspect of my life in everything that I do. It's probably a character flaw, but it's MY character flaw dammit. lol
---
I don't expect others not to vent. Others shouldn't expect me not to call out hyperbole. Other than that, I don't take any of this stuff personally.
