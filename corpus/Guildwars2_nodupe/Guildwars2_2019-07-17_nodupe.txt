I don't play chrono a lot, what is the big hit he took this update?
---
---
---
Nice joke! You got me good.
---
I don't play chrono a lot, what important thing did he lose this patch?
---
Anet's pay is infamous for being incredibly poor for the area you live in, and most new game developers in the USA are actually advised to stay away from them as they focus on cheap labour. This is also why they were able to remain fairly profitable even with multiple side projects of surprisingly large scales being made.
---
I don't play a lot of chrono, what is so awful about the continuum split post patch?
---
I will, thank you very much!
---
Continuum Shift
---
The duration in CS is the same as before, right?
---
Am I missing something in the patch notes? It seems to be the same as before except buffed since it now gives disortion too.
---
Love it!
---
I like these changes, at current game state its much better to nerf classes than buff weaker ones
---
POF was not popular?
---
Bingo. Anet is pretty much obsessed with their metrics and not listening to actual player feedback. While I personally hate SAB, the reason why the second half of it will never be finished is due to Anet's "metrics" saying that the World 2 update wasn't as popular as the first update, even though it was partially due to ascended crafting being introduced in the same update.
---
yeah they have support builds ofc, but whats their power benchmark when you optimise it as much as possible? would be cool to have a number for reference
---
I guess there's not good commanders around right now
---
It's been braindead for so many years.  never understood why people did them when popular.  With the event even, I have no interest in these giant zerg push 1 events.  But what I gathered from others is they like braindead content and like the "social" experience which I guess is a bunch of people standing together and either making bad jokes or complaining about Anet.
---

---
There was a time before megaserver where if you went in the middle of the night you could actually solo them (and before timers were added).  THAT I loved and enjoyed.  Especially the fire elemental before it got nerfed.
---
Yes and no... 
---
Previously we could 1.5second Zero clone Cont.Split-&gt;Grav.Well. 
---
Now we must get a clone up and then 3 second One clone Cont.Split-&gt;Grav.Well.
---
So the time for one clone Cont.Split is unchanged. But the loss of Zero Clone functionality is kinda annoying.
---
\+1 self-shattering was literally half the fun
---
In terms of WvW and PvP, at least, the expansions made massive changes to how long cooldowns were, how powerful skills were, and how many effects each skill had. It's not as big of a deal in PvE, but in other game modes it just made the game much spammier. So I can fully understand desiring a GW2 classic for sPvP.
---
Condi rev throwing in.
---
LS5 next, after that we don't really know. 
---
People are assuming an expansion comes after that
---
And the LS is only free for players who are online at the time, otherwise they at least cost gold-&gt;gems
---
I've been using the burn on dodge trait for some time now with my condi engie.
---
Chrono shatters are more powerful though. 
---
New Mind Wrack is Old Mind Wrack +33% damage when hitting a slowed enemy. 
---
New Diversion is Old Diversion + 2 seconds of slow.
---
I'm waiting to see how the builds land with regard to Lost Time and Danger Time.
---
The next thing is definitely LS5, as they have stated. No mention has been made of an expansion at this time.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
My guess is that they are going to look at some alternative monetization for LS5. Like it won't require any expansions, but will probably seek money in some other way.
---
That also raises questions about supposedly expansion-exclusive features like masteries, although I'd argue those are hardly needed for piecemeal LS releases anyway compared to multi-map expansions.
---
Hopefully GW3.
---
Meanwhile in WvW, you'll be trolling if you don't run one of 5 builds that have barely changed since PoF launch almost two years ago, thanks Mr Anet.
---
Chronos were out of the meta since last change, and now...
---
I got them both and I don't regret it. Now I have so much more content to look forward to, plus options. I played enough HoT to get gliding and enough PoF to get 3 mounts. I died so much in HoT, it's awesome!
---
Except you're not counting for the trait Eternal Champion that gives you +300 toughness while in berserker, making the "trade-off" totally invalid. HMMMMMM
---
Regardless of how effective the skills are to use, the animation team sure outdid themselves with the effects. Such a big step up from the old traps.
---
&gt;but if u going to nerf a class 'cause is broken in X game mode, then NERF IT in that game mode, not in all content
---
Anet: We don't do that here.
---
Can my raid firebrand have his tome cooldowns back to normal please?
---
True, though we do now lose our elite toolbelt skill, just like holo does.
---
Maybe for someone that hasn’t played since launch.
---
Make your own group. You can open story mode yourself. Write in lfg "story everyone welcome" and your group is going to fill.
---
You don't have to pay real money for the skin though? That year you spent grinding will surely earn enough gold to convert to gems. Over the years they've made it increasingly ridiculosly easy to make gold
---
because they have element switching or a toolkit instead.
---
Thief can portal in a mesmer to overcome the 5-man restriction :D
---
I wish the icons on the floor was more like the dragon hunter trap symbols. Not just a sticker on the floor, but something the fits better in the world. I suppose that’s harder when it’s black, because then it’d be hard to notice from far away. But all the same I think the sticker sticks out in an odd way, much like the Herald facet aura.
---
But the animations are cool! I hope they don’t get culled off like many other nice large effects have been in the past.
---
Or you can rely on your healer.
---
You can just stop. You're never going to convince me or anyone else that the class that can give itself almost all the offensive boons it needs and has inate tankiness and high spike damage ALSO needs to have self-resustain. If you're below the scholar bonus, stay out of shroud and let your healer heal you.
---
Wow, did scrapper get kicked in the teeth.
---
I found the guy who's never stepped in ranked, boys!
---
And yet they're still required/asked for exclusively in almost every group I've seen. Hmm... It's almost like these nerfs weren't enough and the devs have maybe finally gotten the balance right.
---
I hate how weapon swapping looks, so Rev was supposed to be my heavy armor class. I was so pisses anet took the easy path and added weapon swapping after people complained.
---
Exactly.. The self shatter like distortion was amazing for an opening for me. Or in an "oh-shit" moment.
---
Shattering now feels troublesome like back in the early days for mesmer. But back then we didn't have all the benchmarks like we do now. This class is completely broken for me and sad to say it. It went from one of the best professions down to one of the worst.
---
PvE and PvP stats should be separate.
---
You know what they say about assumptions
---
Yeah I mean, who wants to see what they're fighting against anyway 😶
---
Now that I think about it too, with the summoned weapons, the number grows even higher.  This is only gated behind a cooldown.  Frost bow, fiery greatsword, lightning hammer, etc...
---
It all depends on the length of season 5 which I believe will be six episodes. Anet would never announce an expansion till living world is done to avoid story spoilers.
---
Sorry dude, outfits only..
---
If that's truly so bad, just change your keybinds…
---
I probably won't log back into this game until season 5 ep 1. I'm just so burned out and this patch is just another kick in the balls.
---
This is the real endgame content.
---
Elementalist wins again!
---
Oh please, you people say that every balance patch.
---
They're usually mostly accurate and contain a kernel of truth even if not 100% accurate.
---
Towershields!
---
From your list, the easiest classes to play are Ranger and Necro. Followed by warrior, then mesmer and holo being the harder ones. 
---
Have you tried Guardian? It's one of the most versatile class and viable in all game modes. At end game it can be dps or healer, useful in PvE, PvP and WvW. 
---
Despite being a heavy armor class, Guardian has a low HP. It compensates by having Aegis, which is incredibly OP when used well. Guardian is also one of the rarer class where Core Guardian is decent (i.e. you can put off getting expansions longer). The other good core class would be Warrior.
---
people keep forgetting that they heal so much out of shroud - like you have to try and facetank stuff to not be above the treshhold
---
That's also intentionally made as a drawback. Scrapper is an upgrade over core, and not core engineer is the only one who has access to elite tool belt skills, giving them a niche that the balance team to easily adjust.
---
so youre talking about how reaper is worst dps and then mention how holo benches lower than that.. *thinking*
---
Still not as bad as Berserker's -300 toughness penalty.
---
it’s Hotkeyed to I + double click
---
Ots not that no one plays SA, its just that on the typical power battle thief style of gameplay, SA is better built for slower styles like pistol/dagger condi thief variants. The SA changes helps builds like those out a fair bit since they can afford to slot in the utility they're forced to give up on some utility (unlike power where you have defensive/evasive options like acrobatics without affecting your build too hard).
---
Absolutely
---
Stupid mistakes like believing they can grow this game without an expansion pack and keep interest when every other major successful MMO has proven that concept out. That was compounded by a seriously lack of leadership at high levels which deviated from GW2 at it's core when the game was far from being withering, an absolute horribly unfocused balance team who do what they want regardless of the feedback from the community...a community that signs all their damned paychecks!
---
I dunno, GW2 is in this really weird spot where it's kind of old, but it really doesn't feel like it because the game really only hit it's stride with HoT. It definitely does not feel like time for GW3. There is so much more they could do with GW2 if they just try.
---
Nah, SA is just kinda bad for everyone. Its specifically for stealth-heavy builds that also want to sustain themselves, but those dont really exist since C&amp;D is the only stealth access thats cheap enough and on a weaponset that wants survivability, but C&amp;D is also really hard to hit. Even the builds that used it, the SA changes hurt them *heavily*, not help them. Losing a lot of survivability for, basically, nothing sucks.
---
Agreed. And I feel like the devs are hinting here that new elite specs are not so far away and they really can’t wait to show them to us.
---
Time to make a new character and not unlock that trait! :)
---
I'm pretty sure static discharge holos absolutely used PBM in pvp?  Like... exclusively?
---
WoW has been out since 2004 and is still going. Just because a game is old doesn't mean they should make a new one.
---
You misunderstand. It's a nerf to the nerf. :D
---
But I have to open inventory first.
---
Thief traps got heavily reworked.
---
[removed]
---
Sword Weaver is an awesome brawler and has access to a few leaps and evades that you can use in leu of having access to ranged attacks. 
---
You can also swap up the attunement of your elemental if you need extra DPS (Fire) or survivability (Water).
---
&gt; I’m a veteran player and I’m going to max out my reward for the world boss rush mostly because I need the map currency for SkyScale.
---
Just to note on this, the reward shown at the top-right is a community reward, not an individual reward.  As long as you've done at least one world boss during the event, you'll get the rewards once the community as a whole has participated in enough boss fights.  So you don't need to personally max it out, it'll max out over time even if you don't play, as long as others do.
---
That's pretty much what they did with many HoT specs when PoF came out. 
---
I remember Berserker being absolutely **GUTTED** right as they released Spellbreaker.
---
Haven't been able to play today yet, how is scrapper in open world and fractals? Like is it actually good for tanking/healing/support kinda stuff? I've been away from the game for a while so it's been hard to reference patch notes
---
I wonder if I should transmute my zerker holo set to something more like healer scrapper or something &gt;____&gt;
---
Warrior and it's elite specs are balanced pretty well in PvE.
---
The problem is Banners and always has been. They're toxic for the game.
---
Thief main as well, finally coming back to play the game again due to them finally doing something for thief.
---
Every single time I find a new class I really like playing it gets nerfed. Back to weaver I guess.
---
Removing distortion lmao the most random fucking nerf they could have done. Chrono was very well balanced before this patch in pve and they decide to nerf its shatters like wtf? why? It's been like fucking 4 years since HoT came out and TODAY they decide "Yup, it would be a good idea to change all of chrono's shatters and remove distortion shatter entirely". Jfc these guys can't make up their mind about chrono and it leads all of us who main the class to get fucked in the ass everytime they decide to try some ridiculous change that's not necessary.
---
Like seriously can you leave chrono spec the fuck alone?
---
Having less episodes doesn't mean more frequent episodes.
---
But flipping burgers in a shitty job is not nearly the same as playing a game mindlessly for a couple of hours. 
---
This constant need for someone to always say, "you're better off getting another job" is tired and idiotic. One of then doesn't subject me to 8 hours of someone else's control.
---
What does the boss chest tonic look like?
---
I like how broken tequatl is.  You take damage from circles before they even spawn.  They can also all stack on each other instantly killing anyone.  The tendrils that sprout out of the ground can also knock you down before they've spawned.  Boss fear in this game is also stupid long.
---
I’ll take an engi with 29k dps as long as they know rotation and mechanics I’m good
---
I just started again 3 months ago since I last played in 2014.
---
My advice is just start fresh with a new class and go from there to acclimate yourself.
---
There are still bunker builds, but they are nowhere near unkillable. Everything can be countered; some will fare better than others.
---
This is the real shit. The toolbelt lock-down is the least offender compared to the Laser's Edge nerf. After all the nerf base damage on forge weapon skills, Laser's Edge was the only thing keeping holo in the game.
---
I agree with you a bit, it's just not constructive around here. You're downvoted into oblivion for having a counter point or not immediately agreeing with other players on certain subjects like buffs/nerfs.
---
Arenanet has a special talent of frustrating their playerbase to the point where they no longer want to play the game. Very good business model! Viable!
---
Keep on nerfing chrono you morons. One day not one chrono is gonna be left and you're gonna have achieved your goal.
---
why not just dont weapon swap then if you dont like it
---
He takes meming too far which bothers people, is kind of toxic at times and allows breeding of mediocrity. Minstrel chrono and mercy scourge for instance which were brought into popularity by teapot allows for a large leeway such that pug groups can often simply rez through, heal through, tank through mechanics going through some wiping. It's a bit of a "feed a man a fish and they won't be hungry for the day but teach a man to fish and they won't go hungry for life"
---
It would have a use, if the preparations didn't have a 3s arm time.
---
ah i see random redditer because i insisted that you simply do not play one class, i do not use my brain. It has seem that your unmatched intellect and unrivaled skill with no backing or proof has bested the internet yet again. Now screenshot your post i am sure this will be the highlight of your day
---
Thank you for such a detailed reply. I think I'll get the expansions as soon as I finish building my new PC. Which should I get first do you think?
---
And this is called reading wayyy into a single sentence
---
No but it means less organic storytelling, which was especially problematic in Season 3 (at least for me).
---
Ideally a thief wouldn't want you to be able to see.
---
I have several charas and never have the urge to play any except my guard
---
“Rating”
---
Less with alacrity.
---
I use nothing but traps on my DH (and the power sig), super fun to watch them pop all at once.
---
The only classes allowed to be op are firebrand, mirage, and all of elementalist.
---
Nah it just means they were encroaching on elementalist and their specs.
---
This is a good point, they're gonna wanna get their story content out soon. Playerbase is gonna drop come fall, especially if we're sitting on another content drought.
---
MMORPG's are just dying out in general, WoW classic isn't going to be any better...
---
Really beautiful but I have no doubt the animations will get toned down.. they seem a bit loud.  But yeah, I'd rather see these than the ugly glowing auras on players.
---
watch where you drop your portal. you scared that village girl.
---
From what I can understand we can expect Living Story Season 5 and more stuff like the World Boss Rush event the near future.  It’s not a good future to be honest, particularly when the competition is bringing out stuff like WoW Classic and Shadowbringers.  I think if GW2 is to survive long term, they’ll need to ditch the Living Story and redo the Gem Store.  
---
As far as I am aware, the Living story has never been successful.  Living Story Season 1 was a failure.  Living Story Seasons 2 – 4 have generally been hit and miss.  The time and resources spent on Seasons 1 – 4 could have easily been 2 more expansions for GW2.  
---
The Gem Store sucks in my opinion.  For example there are a few items I’d love to buy from the Gem Store right now.  The problem is the items I want are either not available because they’re rotating items or they are in lockboxes.  It’s literally a case of me going “shut up and take my money” and ANET replying “shut up I don’t want your money”.  
---
In all honesty, the above problems are really foundational problems that can be traced back to the “Colin era” of GW2.  I get the feeling that Mike doesn’t want to change any of the “Colin era” stuff in GW2 however they’ll need to do this if they want the game to survive.  
---
Lastly I have a suspicion that ANET is going to be reusing code/design elements from the cancelled projects for Season 5.  It would fit into their announcement that Season 5 will have “expansion like features”.  It does make me think that one of the projects that was cancelled might have been an expansion or a spin-off game.
---
If it was just supposed to be different and not just better, then for years chronos wouldn't have just a straight up extra shatter, theif extra dodge and doge mechanic, engi gets the function gyro, DH gets improved f etc. No tradeoffs, in absolute terms, better. Tradeoffs are a recent idea, the devs backtracking.
---
Things needed to be toned down a little, but these steps make the specialisations super clunky to play.
---
Because he sounds like a whiny bitch. I've never heard of them before this, nor sat through a single video so its a bit presumptuous to call themselves important.
---
If they dont like it. Shut up and leave. Don't announce it first. No one cares. No ones going to beg you to stay. 
---
Bye?
---
Honestly yeah. This is pof spec level of animations
---
But ViSuAL CluTtEr
---
still check the subreddit often in hopes of hearing about some meaningful update to WvW that isn't going to make the game mode worse (lol mounts) and login to chat with friends and guildies from time to time but less and less people have been logging on now. haven't really played the game for close to 3 years now.
---
As far as i know a lot of OG guilds either died or split up / transferred servers.
---
Yeah, I don’t get doing it more than once.  It’s ok when learning the game,  but that’s about it.
---
I agree. Maybe it would have been easier to balance too. Just two legends wouldn't be enough, but they could work it around in some other way.
---
I'm pretty sure he's referring to the days of Illusionary Persona being a mandatory trait for all mesmer builds because of how clunky the class feels without it and now chrono has arrived in those dark ages with no chance of even choosing to have Illusionary Persona. It's god awful.
---
Not sure what the balance patch will do to the meta but [Dragonhunter](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/power-dragonhunter) didn't change much and it's a great DPS choice (can also run as a [quickness power firebrand](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/hybrid-firebrand) in the same gear). Other good choices are [power banner warrior](https://discretize.eu/builds/warrior/banner-warrior) or power banner berserker (banners are always wanted and the power DPS build isn't bad as well), [power soulbeast](https://discretize.eu/builds/ranger/power-soulbeast), and if you wanted to play the other half of the firebrand comp, [alacrity renegade](https://discretize.eu/builds/revenant/hybrid-renegade).
---
The irony is that this barely affected PvP holo, which doesn't rely on overheat.
---
The only content announced is lw5. Anything after is player speculation. Oh and we didnt get any news on when lw5 starts
---
I'm still in the mid-end game stage. Inventory wars.
---
At least for Taidha .. the door needs a 75% health reduction, and Taidha herself could use at least a 50% health increase.  A world boss fight shouldn't be mostly about hitting a door..
---
I just changed mine back to core mesmer. Lower dps I suppose, but it doesn't feel frustrating to play. Not like I need godly damage in the open world anyway.
---
I wasn't arguing the value, just suggesting something that could be bought via the tp.
---
I went with the Marvel Comics motif for my Valkyrie (black/lightish blue) and although I went with the black wings to complete the look, white wings also work (and call to mind angels). This looks REALLY good, though - great job.
---
WvW linked teams of 2 medium or small servers together. Right now Magumma is hosting with anvil rock. My Guild CTH Company of traveling Heros was found when that system first came in place.  Shadowcreed leads it with Xushin lurking in our discord. servers
---
Thieves should also get the mesmer like indication, BUT with one huge difference.  It should only be visible to the player themselves.  They have this technology already.  To see this in action, go get a guild boon like magic find and ask other players what they see.  They can't see it all even though you can.
---
Is it me or is warclaw not finding stealthed enemies anymore?
---
Can't...stand...such...wind!!!
---
And once again Engi gets the middle finger. Why? Who knows why honestly, the amateurs that run this game's balance get full on panic attacks if Engi has a straightforward-ish build that has okay DPS and survivability (nowhere near as good as literally everyone else though) without requiring you to break your fingers on boring kits. Nerf Nerf Nerf!
---
The more time goes on the more I feel like what this game truly needs is a different dev team.
---
I didn't even know thieves had portals what? lol
---
It's on the table my friend, don't worry about it! While you wait, why don't you buy the latest chair in the Gemstore? Or perhaps a new glider, could you be interested in that?
---
Not just any door.. We see the whole wooden ship in the land and decide: "Forget all this wood shit. We will bomb that dense thick metal door for eternity"
---
You can get a lot of interesting looking skins from achievement collections (in hero panel/achievements) or other rewards in game. Also dyes from the trading post are account-wide and permanent unlocks to help change your colors at any time in the hero panel. It's only the armor/weapon skins/models themselves that cost charges to change, dyes don't cost charges to dye an item.
---
If you want to preview skins you can go to a bank and check the wardrobe storage and click on them to look at them. Then while ingame type /wiki itemsname    and it'll bring up the wiki page for it and show how to get that item (or just google gw 2 wiki for the item). The wiki is a great source of information, otherwise dulfy's guides or youtube has good guides on how to do the achievements or whatever else to unlock a skin or item.
---
Also there's outfits you can use that don't need transmutation charges, most are on the gemstore, but there's a really cheap way to get your first outfit, in the outfits menu on your hero panel
---
If you buy this on the trading post, really cheap usually coppers or silver: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endless_Common_Clothing_Tonic
---
then go to this npc and exchange it for the outfit version: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Exchange_Specialist
---
you can get the permanent unlock 'common clothing outfit' for all your characters: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Common_Clothing_Outfit
---
Otherwise I would just do the racial cities for the charges, once you do them and know where all the points of interest are, it gets faster and easier to complete the cities. You could create a character to do that, use the charges to get it in your wardrobe and delete the character. That gets really mind-numbingly boring to repeat too much after a while, though.
---
since yesterdays balance patch they have it
---
Oh boy here we go again another one of these posts opening up Pandora’s box xD
---
It's fine. I didn't say it was dead by posting the numbers. You're justifying this too much.
---
Its new as of today.
---
Great video and personality. Coo!
---
Or I'm tired of people repeating an obvious falsehood. Posting the numbers that are sitting on the side bar with no context doesn't add to the conversation. Pointing that out is sort of what reddit is for, no?
---
Portal range is 5000.
---
This was literally my favorite skill in the whole game, and they gutted it. Fuck
---
I have actually tried out the change and it has become really boring in my opinion at least. Just casting embrace and spamming weapin skills just isn't fun.
---
It's reminiscent of ye ole' power herald which was basically just auto attacking. And while some people enjoy that, it's certainly not for me.
---
long live firebrand and scourge.
---
They revamped all thief trap skills into new skills called preparations.  They are core thief skills. One is a portal.  One is a projectile blocker. One is cc and power damage. One is condi damage. 
---
The portal is a one way 5000 range portal that can take up to 5 allies and grants stealth on arrival.
---
Ye he does, I'm pretty sure Anet has asked him before not to spoil story. I understand why he doesn't.
---
That doesn't stop me wanting to know more though and if someone was spilling it, spoilers included, I'd want to read that too :o
---
You must be from a different dimension then
---
I don't think there are any chances for Shatterer to be changed again, not after Jahai Bluffs variant being introduced which is far more interesting encounter - Blazeridge original despite of later changes is still same biting the right ankle tactic and the only way to do achievements is to have someone around who's willing to guide people.
---
IIRC, they were working around Taidha just to fix problem with boss herself which at certain situations would stuck at the beach and break rest of the fight - that was before world boss schedule was added and no later changes were made. Maybe it's the classic spaghetti code issue
---
Not to say ele isn't underpowered right now, but some of us do enjoy the complexity :)
---
&gt; last few balance patches
---
I didn't say that they did everything in one patch. It's a work in progress.
---
So what you're saying is I should probably not play anything if I want a decent chance at endgame stuff. /s kinda
---
One would think why even keep drop tables in the client... Not that I'm complaining, I love when developers leak their own secrets accidentally.
---
since its gone forever now "for his sanity", i would guess it made him a lot of trouble when programming?
---
A competent development team would eventually sit down and ask themselves why, despite a **barrage** of nerfs, these classes stay meta, and maybe whether they've been curing symptoms instead of illnesses all this time.
---
&gt; Chronos have had nerf after nerf after rework after nerf, and they are still great in all game modes.
---
They feel **shit** to play. Granted they were only "alright/decent" when they started, but the whole spec is just screwed IMO.
---
Should get scrapped. And I say this as a main. Go back to the drawing board with just the idea, "manipulate time". **Throw out every single other thing**. Then start over.
---
Its not a bug. This was supposed to be 4th path in meta...
---
Why would you go through that Gravity Well effort if you can just use any other class and get much more reliable CC access?
---
Well shit... it’s a stealth, 5000 range port, and an invis. How is this not an elite skill?
---
&gt; jul.16.2019: removed dependency on d3dx9 (healthbar) for my sanity.
---
Does this mean that it no longer supports chainloading?
---
Funny, I remember when it was entirely normal that you couldn't shatter without clones. In fact I still remember that as "the normal way for it to work".
---
Devolve, you mean?
---
Eh it could be worse, at least they aren't adding in a talent that 90% of the player base exploited to no end only to take it away less than 48 hours later. That was a fun two days on my priest, 40% decreased shield cost and 80% movement speed buff for a couple of seconds. Those two days were fun as hell. Blizzard did that by the way.
---
that I'm not sure of.. I use launchbuddy which loads things individually and doesn't depend on chainload fortunately..
---
Thief really got some love with this update. Chrono... not so much.
---
But they are not just shitting over them. They make that each spec has some advantage and some disadvantage. You can play with spcific numbers once you have the main technical aspect done. 
---
That way there is always a place for *any* specialization, regardless if the new one has better numbers or not, there will always be a place where specific old specialization, or even core build, will shine. Looking at just numbers is pretty wrong, and numbers are easiest to adjust once the changes sink in and people find out best builds. 
---
They are doing those changes on purpose to actually not introduce just another power creep. I don't know why people are so mad.
---
I can imagine
---
Scourge portal because nobody ever takes it.
---
Why transmute? You better get another set, or even go ffor long term investment of legendary armor. If you play pvp or wvw, those are pretty easily reachable. That way you will have total freedom to change from holo to scrapper, to core, to anything. Anytime. And even if new balance patch arrives, you can easily adjust for free.
---
And when build templates will arrive, you will be ready as well. It is pretty good chance that their inhouse build templates will be directly bound to legendary equipment.
---
It is pretty limited in terms of the max people that can go through it (5, and in pvp only 1!) and how you have to prepare it first, it would be a waste to have it as an elite skill
---
I ended up switching to an ele in WvW because that's what the guild was wanting instead of a Chrono (as I wouldn't switch to Mirage, whose DPS is more useful overall nowadays); the straight heals were just more consistently useful than the sometimes useful Chrono toolkit and heal-traited wells. I think I've had to drop portals to move folks around like twice? But I keep people alive now every raid.
---
I've already taken a long break from the game due to a lack of content. If that continued for another entire year I'd forget this game even existed.
---
Something similar to Sweet Tooth from Twisted Metal would be badass.
---
They were finally in a balanced place they didn’t need to go overboard by reverting the Illusionary Persona Baseline change
---
Are these thief skills? What the hell.
---
Visibility channels are not that advanced and probably won't ever be on this game engine. They can't even phase single NPCs if they are in combat or moving.
---
And while you hated The Silverwastes and Dry Top  I loved them and for me are still one of the best maps ANet ever put out.
---
You are blocked out of toolbelt skills for about 15 seconds so it basically makes the cooldown for all toolbelt skills 15 seconds provided you kick them off just before you overheat. That's way overboard. You also sit there looking like an old fart auto-attacking for 15 seconds. It makes no sense with PBM where you are supposed to overheat.
---
How to be a sneaky thief and steal people's stuff. Step 1. Ensure everybody on the continent can see you. Step 2. Wait no hang on
---
I only started to mess with it yesterday.
---
Its included in the "extra" dll of ARC DPS. Once you put that dll next to the main dll, alt+shift+T menu will include an additional menu called extras. Turn on "save/restore some profession keybinds".
---
Example:
---
Then, for example at chrono set F5 for "profession skill 4" and set F4 for "profession skill 5" in normal ingame control options. Now if you logout and login with your scourge for example, then it should be untouched, so F5 will still makes you into desert shroud. Oh and one more thing, in this example when you are on chrono, you have to bind F4 for profession skill 5, even if there is no more 5th shatter. I read somewhere that without this it wont work.
---
So something like this. Correct me where Im wrong, Im also experiementing with it.
---
If you seriously think the main mechanic for DD is steal then what you perceive as "high skill level" must float around bronze-silver.
---
That's what it was before, each clone would give you 1.5s, and it would always include you as a clone.
---
They are both really good! for the mounts you'll want to get Path of Fire first. If you're enjoying the story so far though, get HoT and play it chronologically. It may be worth waiting for a sale so that you can get both expansions for 50% off, those seem to happen fairly often and it's a great deal
---
If you blind them with your shinyness they can't see you
---
It should be in "extras" download folder. IIRC it can also disable daily achievements or story popups from the screen.
---
What's really cool about this is, it's running Air/Water. Both Piercing Shards and Flow Like Water now provide pretty reliably 10% damage modifiers, which makes the traitline a viable alternative for damage builds. And it comes with some built-in survivability. I'm looking forward to trying WvW backline staff with Fire/Water/Weaver.
---
Nice, thanks!
---
Do you know if you can save setups that can be accessed for multiple classes/characters? or you need to make one for each of them individually?
---
In addition to other comment, sword weaver is also a very strong pick.
---
I can see you haven’t played engi much, drama queen. 
---
Only toolbelt is disabled now, so how is auto attacking after overheat different from what it was before the patch?
---
And by the way, the rotation required you to use f2, f3, f4 while still in forge form, so the only thing (functionality-wise) that is gone now is delaying your big ol’ bomb for cc, or using f1 for cc if you have AED on.
---
The whole reason this word boss event is a thing is -because- it is a low effort thing for them to add while they work on other stuff. I'm pretty sure that they don't really have the resources to make these kind of changes that are higher on the investment scale
---
Bro it's already in the game. Look in the Gemstore. Tons of skins! And u know how many are obtainable by doing SOMETHING in the game? 
---
It's (500-499\*1)/1 ....
---
If you wanted to grind for the currency you could do the hearts and/or do the metas. There’s often a meta train going on.
---
Not very nice of you to respond to just a single line of my comment, pretending the rest of it does not exist. 
---
So, again: How is auto attacking different from before the patch? You had to auto attack before as well
---
Chrono hit 12k on me with F1 in PvP. Just throwing that out there.
---

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.

---
Dude too soon. The body hasn't even cooled down a bit from yesterday's patch that killed it.
---
I'll just use core mesmer for open world. Stuff dies fast for Chronophantasma to be effective anyway.
---
I wouldn't say "required". It was just the last remaining part of the initial arcdps implementation, without ImGui. Healthbar can easily be reimplemented now as an ImGui window, I'm guessing /u/deltaconnected just hasn't gotten around to it yet. Said window can be made titlebarless, with transparent background, so it looks just like the previous healthbar and can still be dragged around.
---
chainloading works fine for me. i chainload arc-&gt;radial
---
Join an active guild and they’ll help you get up to speed. It’ll take a long while to get used it.
---
If there is one thing I know, it's that there is no such thing as "easily fixing class balance". Sure, doing such a thing might add Scrapper as an additional tank option in raids, but it could also potentially completely push out Chrono out of that position if it ends up strictly better, or completely break balance of Fractals, PvP and WvW by adding such a thing.
---
Why? Because Holo was alrewdy being out performes by moat other DPS classes so the only logical thing to do would be to destroy the class.
---
#Balance.
---
Dang, I just came back to GW2 a few days ago, was it a good event? I never tried it 🤦‍♂️
---
Hey, Chrono was in a good spot so it was only right for Anet to nerf it
---
I know there are lots of people that use afterburner so just make sure you have the latest version and you should be good. You can try to [repair the game](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/201863008-Repairing-the-Game-Client) but it doesn't sound like that's the issue to me. Have you tried lowering your settings or trying to [optimize](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8gctrf/full_guide_maximizing_your_fps_and_game/?st=jy723xx6&amp;sh=6d9e58fe) the game a little more?
---
As someone who plays nothing but holo and does cms+t4 daily, i just feel like quitting now.
---
Yeah, even though Chrono was in a decent spot they just had to destroy the class
---
Just goes to show how out-of-touch they are. They don't even play their own fucking game
---
&gt;WvW guilds flooding out of the game, etc... 
---
WvW is already dead.
---
Most of the actual WvW players/guilds quit years ago.
---
Newer or PvE players that came to WvW late simply aren't aware of how much WvW already declined. And to put it in perspective T1/T2 on EU is approximately equivalent to about t5 4+ years ago.
---
Or that when we had triple links on some EU matchups and some players were amazed at a 90 man queue on EB at reset, if you go back to say 2015 (let alone earlier) and say FSP when it was the bandwagon, there was a period where on normal primetimes (not reset) it had 150-190 queue on EB and every border queued with 20+, two of those borders full of guilds, and that was 1 server, not 2 or 3 linked together like now.
---
Anet's balancing at its finest
---
This skill is so confusingly buggy in PvP. Sometimes the mark just outright won't appear and other times the portal just doesn't open at all, all within range. 
---
Really hope they fix it up.
---
&gt;Plus I wouldn't mind Shatterer's break bar being a bit easier (because no one runs back to throw bombs)
---
How about doing the actual mechanic? Oh wait I forgot this is gw2 and we dont do that here.
---
To be fair you should pretty whiny yourself.
---
&gt; cooled down
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Burst_of_Strength_(effect) this?
---
I wanna mix and match though
---
If they were +9 levels rather than go to level 9, that would be even better
---
It gives you a buff after using the skill and hitting someone that increases your damage for a few seconds. 
---
Just badly worded since it's not really a boon but works more like Spotter, just for yourself tho
---
Guard Masterrace .
---
Then don't invest in outfits
---
It was also my plan to unlock a full set this way. Luckily it doesn't take too long to fill the track if you do WvW dailies.
---
Feels so weird now.
---
Isn't 33% less damage when Revealed better? Hiw often do you tank damage in Stealth?
---
Sorry but the power is evaluated with realistic buffs. After all you look at actual in combat scenarios.
---
With 25 might, food, banners, ... whatever SC considers realistic buffs, I'm certain weaver has more than 3k power in pve. In wvw decent weaver builds should also be well above 3k (in my experience 3.8-4.2k used to be doable)
---
new patch, they replaced all the old thief traps
---
Next time anet does a core event I do hope they simply disable elite specs.
---
Less chance of them introducing gamebreaking bugs for a weeklong event.
---
&gt; Or you can rely on your healer.
---
Oh sweet, I can get healed in shroud now? Nice, when was that added it?
---
&gt;You're never going to convince me or anyone else
---
I mean you know. Except literally every single raid group that refuses to take reaper because he is beyond dogshit in every single raid wing. 
---
I get it, you only like to play on queensdale, that's cool, but for people who actually do engame they're already pretty convinced reaper is trash, so I don't need to convince anyone.
---
Its cute and all that you're trying to be absolute, but next time try to at least have a slither of a modicum of an idea of what you're talking about and how that applies outside open world events, because right now its obvious you don't when you're trying to pretend reaper is top tier in raids.
---
&gt; If you're below the scholar bonus, stay out of shroud and let your healer heal you.
---
So, fuck up your rotation and sacrifice DPS then. Which is literally what the trait helped prevent.
---
Not really sure about this, every new graphical effect they make nowadays is just much better than it was in core game. They do so many changes recently that if they were in final stages of making elites, that would keep messing up everything they do.
---
I think we are at least few episodes away from elite classes at best. They must tidy up all elite specs and give them some drawbacks and this reworks are not done yet.
---
The really shitty part is that switching mains, as WvW is most of what I do, is going to cost me real money to upgrade bag slots (and bags). I don't *want* to financially reward them for fucking my spec and forcing me to switch mains.  
---
Maybe it's time to quit gaming, cash grabbing and shit like this just isn't fun anymore. I don't mind spending money, but I want to spend it on something I want, not just having to spend it to have the same quality of life I had before they fucked my spec.
---
AoE gathering, then Randomized materials, and now Downgraded materials
---
Wvw tourney implies anet capable of having a remotely decent wvw tournament. Spoiler they arent. Itd just further show what a shitshow 2019 wvw is.
---
It's saved per-class.
---
Must be balance patch day. Chrono was killed again. Strange how it dies every patch, then dies the next patch for the last 8 patches.
---
How many times have chronomancers been changed again?
---
It’s balance patch day. Let the chrono have their ceremonial whine fest.
---
I get your sentiment but how is hearthstone doing? Because a LOT of the big hearthstone streamers have quit and streamed other games.
---
Obviously they sticked around pretty long, they were literally getting money. But their concerns were very valid, and never addressed. Now that many viewers also moved on, hearthstone streaming and competitive is a ghost town. Many  big hs streamers playing autobattlers, other card games, ... instead. The only psycho that remains is thijs. 
---
The game continues to milk naive players throwing money at it. I assume it's doing well financially, even. But I dont think its ecosystem is doing well. And its slowly getting worse.
---
Sound familiar?
---
A of actually. Stealth is mostly useless defense-wise, as AoEs and melee attacks will have no issue hitting you. Hell, you won't even get revealed a lot because you'd rather let the Stealth run ou than attack out of it, mostly because Stealth attacks are bad. So you much rather would have the 33% buff in Stealth than when revealed.
---
I like how the fashion warrior is the bulky one, lol.
---
Reverted as much as possible to keep hardcore casuals happy.
---
100 percent this
---
It's almost like repetition is fine as long as core issues are addressed and gameplay itself has some inherent variety.
---
I'm not impressed at all.  It's kinda sad, really.
---
Why try to hide yourself in stealth when you could blind the enemy instead and make it impossible to see you?
---
I can't count. I was chrono main before but I lost track on what is good again so I go with thief.
---
They're so good it makes me think they were intended for an elite specialisation...
---
It just seems bad gameplay if you are getting hit in Stealth often, after all, you would either be getting outplayed by acting predictably so enemy can guess where you are or you dive into damage  during Stealth. 
---
The change also makes sense for SA as there are other traits in the line that buff Stealth attacks.
---
Messing around with different trait combinations can be fun :) Doing that whilst you're still new will pay dividends later on when you're able to swap out skills and traits to adapt to a new boss or fractal on the fly.
---
I guess not even 5 boxes will bring people to do TT?
---
I feel you. I really hate open world but guess who has spent a lot of time in open world unlocking skins with collections...
---

Nope. The management issue has nothing to do with *who* the managers are, rather what their vision of the game is. They want to make a casual game for carebears where you run around the open world pressing F and collecting rewards, and then log out. I don't think that has anything to do with race or gender or sexual orientation no matter how badly you want that to fit your narrative.
---
TTT community does it twice per day every day, at least on EU side. Always full maps.
---
He's gonna go Alien on us and burst out of Aurene, killing her in the process and sending all the magic back into the world. Jormag, Primordus and Bubbles all power up as a result and we have a 4-way grand slam between them and Super Joko.
---
no it's just rip holo overall..your best bet is either condi holo(which is also worse but kinda workable) or core condi engi
---
however, why play that nonsense when you can go mirage(unchanged) and just outdps everyone, except other mirages :)
---
'twas a good patch
---
Not really, the idea is that youre gonna be hit anyway, but Stealth allows you to lower it. It has nothing to do with being outplayed, the issue is that right after you Stealth, the enemy always know where you are, and tracking you is easy.
---
Those don't helpt,especially since the values are way too low.
---
Yeah but Deadeye sucks and doesn't want to use SA anymore. Also deaths judgement is useless, but for the simple reason that with how telegraphed it is, you don't hit it on anyone spwho isn't afk.
---
It always was the other person using it first yesterday. Maybe the other way around? First thief then the other? Or it's just bugged right now.
---
Honestly? You'll struggle to pull your weight as condi DPS scourge without vipers.
---
However, if you're dead-set on playing scourge then you can put together a decent support build using Magis gear.
---
Not gonna happen because legacy content, but good lord could the Fire Elemental pre use the nerf hammer.
---
Currently doing Funerary... Rip
---
that idiot thinks doing 29k dps(when the support warrior does 33k or so) is fine so i doubt you'll get any sort of rational answer, if any
---
it's what happens when casuals chime in about balance without any sort of understanding of it
---
Wierd it is the worst class I tried I could not survive as a Dragonhunter. I guess it is different for everybody.
---
I can't blame him. Would you still be hyper about a game you play since 7 years without it being changed alot? Look at WoW after 7 years and how many add-ons they had and than look at Guild Wars 2...having 2 add-ons...which only added a bit of story and a couple of nice features. Nothing to be invested in for the long-term run.  
---
I never loved a MMO so much as GW2 and I doubt I will ever be able to play with such enthusiasm another MMO as I played GW2, but in my humble opinion I think GW2s era is comming to an end. 
---
A little story update, which can be played in &lt; 3hrs every three month isn't something to keep players from playing the game. And look at the people, who mainly do fractals or raids. They have to do the same sh\*t over and over again and can be happy, if they get a new fractal or raid wing in a year\~  
---
The biggest problem is just that the game as an online game get's updated too rarely. People won't just sit there and wait for the next LS for ever. At one point they get tired and probably forget the game all along.
---
and yeah, I agree with Mr.Teapot-guy. Too much stuff is bound to the gemstore. The main goal of fashion wars became farming gold and change it to gems, so you can buy all the neat items from the store. There is no 'journey', like you do with the griffon or skyscale mount, which rewards you at the end, or a rare drop in the raid wings, which looks nice and is account-bound. It's just a game of farming gold / converse to gems/ buy from gemstore/ repeat.
---
I get that Anet has to make money somehow, but how would they make money, if most of their audience moves on without their precious "whales" to keep the numbers in black?
---
&gt;I'm a seasoned WoW player as most of you guys probably is
---
This is wrong. I bet many - myself included - never killed a single rat in Azeroth.
---
A sizable amount of players are GW1 veterans, others came from non-MMO games, others just wanted to experiment and stayed.
---
While posts from WoW refugees pop out once in a while, my wild guess is that they represent a small slice of the GW2's population.
---
Is he dead? Or left the game?
---
With a bit of balancing this could maybe work.
---
Core mesmer gets distortion, core engie gets elite toolbelt skills, core ele gets a second weapon to make up for no overcharge/dual attunement
---
Honestly, condi engi would be my favorite if it was not for the complete lack of burst and hard punish if you miss an internal cooldown (gunk field).
---
As it stands, cholo is still playable, burst even got a smidge better with the change to blowtorch. If you cared about competing, than nothing beats mirage anyway, so what's the point.
---
Good advice, but just a small correction - you don't need to do CM to get Ad Infinitum. Someone new to fracs still doesn't need to worry about CM yet all the same!
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defiance_bar
---
There's a list at the bottom for each class.
---
Individuals can do the mechanic all they want, but if most players don't make an effort, it will still fail. I've only ever seen it broken on organised runs.
---
To be fair that’s not ONLY auto attacking but holy shit what the hell did they do??
---
Does anyone know if there’s gonna be some super tryhard on-par-with-triple-conjure-weaver condi rotation that will cross 40k or something extreme? I didn’t even know earth conjure auto did damage lol
---
If ever, then this week is perfect for doing it. Just be early on maps to get full squads, or just join theirs TS for coordinated map jump :)
---
The blue bar breaks with Crowd Control effects.  There are two types of CCs, hard and soft.
---
Hard CCs are effects like: daze, stun, knockback, knockdown, lift, pull, push, etc
---
Soft CCs are conditions: cripple, immobilize, chill, blind, weakness
---
Hard CCs are instant where as soft CCs are breakbar damage over time
---
Defenders no, only Assaulter offers Berserker.
---
That bench uses full condis on golem, it has no meaning
---
So... there's just a wiki list and there's no indicator of that in the game?
---
Why? OP appears to enjoy and love the game. If they want to spend all their free time playing the game, then who are we to judge that their life is sad? Your standard of how ones life should be does not reflect how another's should be.
---
&gt; Boss fear in this game is also stupid long.
---
Agreed, though it *is* funny when you dodge/block the fear, and everyone around you runs while you stay fighting :P
---
Yeah, the damage from warrior seems balanced until you realize that condi banners dps literally used to not change by taking banners. The non-banners build did maybe 400 more dps or something. Basically it was on par with most dps classes but it took the best unique buff in the game at no opportunity cost, making it mandatory in every squad. That’s pretty broken.
---
Oh... so DoT CC's are bar breakers right? Hmm... ok. Still think it should be indicated in game somehow on the skill itself...
---
Everything that does CC (crowdcontrol). There is no Tutorial or anything to know but grom slow to immobilize to chill to saze to stun basically everything does contribute. The "harder" the CC the better with polymorphs and launch being the "hardest" / breaking the bar the most.
---
For Reaper you have many things. The best/hardest CCs are greatsword 5, shroud 5 and flesh golem elite. Then you can have all sorts of other CC. Just read you skills and if there is anything that is not direct damage or condition damage it will probably help break the bar.
---
Also:

---
Rip hopes and dreams
---
Honestly, if enhanced was supposed to ever be a choice, it would have to give part (or all) of lasers edge while out of forge.
---
Additionally you could give heat bonuses to utilities and other weapon skills scaling to 100 heat or more to make the trait worthwhile that way, but too much work.
---
I mean it fits the enge meme of capable of everything, worse at everything, holo was a nice dream while it lasted.
---
Apologies, I'd completely forgotten! If I see CM in game, it usually refers to 99 or 100 but you're absolutely right.
---
Taken King single-handedly salvaged D1. Forsaken smashed it for D2 as well - hopefully Shadowkeep carries the momentum through
---
I sometimes go. Ack and forth between elementary and guard. I main elements and I find I cant seem to survive as a guardian like I do on ele.
---
Yeah but the point is you spend a loooot less time in revealed than in stealth. You want to avoid revealed as much as possible, so you just let the stealth run out while healing up.
---
No I don't want a large Braham. I want a goddamn lvl 2 cola!
---
Don't forget Slow, Taunt, and Fear
---
Not disagreeing that it's a rough change for sure.  Only thing I can offer is that there are a number of guilds I am in and have been in that take a more casual approach to t4s and CMs and will allow just about any DPS class that actually knows their stuff in to play, rather than solely basing it on most optimal classes.  Maybe you take an extra 10 minutes top for the entire run of t4s because not everyone is 100% optimal but I prefer to steer clear of the super speed runners anyway.  You sound like you know what you're doing, so if you're on NA servers I could probably make some guild recommendations.
---
If Season 5 is longer than 3 episodes, it'll take more than 9 months.
---
Noooooo the ingame health % is uselessly vague crap D:
---
VR is dead
---
How is legendary armor "easily reachable" if you play WvW, and what makes it easier than going that route using PvE?
---
Chronophantasma roamer is still incredibly bursty and strong in WvW.  I don't sPvP so can't comment on potential builds there, but I am hearing things about how mind-bogglingly high stacks of confusion chrono can output at the moment, rivaling and maybe even surpassing mirage, so I doubt chrono is dead there either.
---
I'm on EU sadly, but I appreciate it, thanks.
---
I'd settle for only seeing my own skill effects.
---
&gt; there's just a wiki list
---
that's where most of the information about the game is.
---
it's the best tool there is, use it.
---
Arena net are making gw2 a seasonal game that you will play it ones every 3 month
---
Yeah it takes me longer to adjust to playing guardian (or in my case firebrand) than most other classes.
---
I main mirage now, after making ele for years, and I can jump into Holo, Deadeye, Chrono, Reaper without any hesitation.
---
Scourge, Soulbeast, and Spellbreaker take a bit of time to get back into them and knock the rust off...
---
But firebrand? For whatever reason, it seems like it takes me forever to get back into the groove.
---
It's a very badly communicated mechanic.  The best CC that Reaper has available to it is Flesh Golem Charge &amp; Warhorn (4).
---
Problem is they are doing it one by one. They take your spec, make it shit for possibly years util everyone is bought in line.
---
Which won't happen anyways since new elite specs will just be added anyways without any drawbacks and your spec remains in bottom tier indefinitely.
---
That actually looks like proper shadow magic.
---
That class didn't deserve portals anyways, dont ask for more. They'll give you portal counte and 5 other bugs
---
How about Shadow Behemoth randomly place a bomb with a 3 second fuse right in the middle of any blob of players greater than 10 so people have to move around rather than stand still and auto attack. This should be easy enough to do. 
---
Or make some of the purple portal monsters  leap into the blob and knock everyone back. 
---
Whatever. It’s brain dead.  People like it that way. I’ll take what I like and leave the rest. 
---
Tons of places to get yellows.
---
It's a 2 second exit stealth. Enough to immediately SR afterwards in PVE.
---
"firespit" huahahahehe. that had a different animation too right? I actually don't remember it cause i was playing scepter+dagger on release, but they could give the original animation for fireball back too y, or at least follow your suggesting and rename the skill to "firespit" for the lols.
---
They nerfed things that aren't even used in PvP. Every holo ever runs Thermal Release Velve.
---
It's just weird all around. Holo is OP in PvP and had to be nerfed, but holo in PvP was barely affected by any of these changes while PvE got gutted.
---
Yes yes yes.   World bosses should be bosses.  Bosses mercilessly slaughter. 
---
“Oh you were mercilessly slaughtered? I’m sorry, maybe you should, I don’t know, pay attention?”
---
From the patch notes: 
---
&gt; Thief trap skills are being retired **for now** and replaced by a new type of ability: Preparations
---
Remember guardian elite tomes?
---
&gt; This skill is split between game modes, allowing 5 allies through in PvE and WvW, while only allowing one ally through in PvP.
---
The player itself is an ally, otherwise we had skills that affect 6 players.
---
I hear you, but at the same time, if you are someone like me who has everything they want except for those super rare items and you make it so that I have no way of getting them... why should I play your game any more?  Nothing should be so out of reach.  It's a major reason why I only log in and do dailies any more.  I give them no money via the gem store any more or anything.  They have effectively lost me as a player.  I was saving gold to purchase the chak egg sac but I stopped around 12k.  It just isn't fun.  I would rather be able to work towards the item for myself.
---
Next patch: fixed a bug where some boons did not appear to other players.
---
Oh, I remember reading on the preview notes that it was 1 + an ally
---
Well, you basically need just resources and doing enough WvW every week for few weeks to accumulate skirmish tickets. You get grandmaster marks from pip chests as well to buy the ascended precursor.
---
While it is way faster when you are winning, you can still be losing and you will be getting pips, heck, yo ucan even afk most of the time repairing that one wall again and again, still earning pips. Same for PvP, you can lose all matches and you will still earn pips to get stuff. Yes, it will take 3-4x more matches, but that is just matter of time.
---
For legendary armor from PvE you actually have to kill bosses in raids and complete collections with special conditions while killing those bosses. 
---
Doing both ways from zero still is months of stuff to do, while raids can be fastest if you clear bosses with no problems, they also require some amount of skill. But usually people do play WvW or PvP already anyways, so they might have good chunk of tickets already available, cutting off the timegate on it there. But in worst case scenario one does not need to do much in both those competitive modes, however it won't be fun nor fast.
---
Not for everyone. Some people enjoy large scale fights. While 50 is most of the times bad, there ARE competitive people who enjoy the tactics. My guild makes alliances with other guilds in other to make engaging strategies to dismantle huge blobs, flank and work together. Don't assume everyone just blobs away mindless in squads of 50. If you enjoy smaller scale fights, just make small havoc groups and dodge the zergs. Simple. But asking the devs to do stuff to dismantle the large scale playstyle (like I saw the debuff being suggested) is egotistical. Also, 10 - 15 is NOT zerging. It's a raid tactics size squad. The only debuff that should exist should concern the amount of people online in server.
---
Other team is blobing? Make several small squads and capture other objectives. The zerg is 1 group, can't be at all places. Or just organize the players to fight the server. If your server can't do that, you either don't have enough people online or too many useless players around. It's a matter of numbers and player quality. Everything else is just forcing a certain playstyle on people and that's never ideal.
---
Visual noise is still a problem in PvP. It wouldn't be a problem if it was only a PvE animation.
---
It never did.
---
Watch the golem helicopter for 15 minutes and then boss spawns and is dead in 20 seconds tops.

It certainly would considering that guard is top tier everywhere.
---
Because they are "braindead" events is exactly why I run with the world boss train.  I save the challenging content for real life and play games to escape that mentality.
---
Too real
---
I stood around and made bad gw2 puns and earned 5 gold in 15 min excluding the boss loot. It’s the new meta gold farm I swear fam.
---
Haku Nurarihyon is rocking the place now that core necro is viable again (but not a replacement for the expansions reaper and Scourge elites)
---
It looks nice but the hair kind of ruins it, imo.
---
Change freaking septer one auto it’s a terrible animation
---
Its non subscription so you can go and come back as you like. I personally play just for wvw.
---
Logged in last night and seems none of the guardian changes were included in the patch. Traitlines and GS changes were not live
---
True but do you realize that you can get everything in gem store with in game gold pretty easily?
---
Remember when ele auras were too visually intensive?
---
Pepperidge Farms remembers.
---
I did remove it. It was a compatibility/exclusion headache for chainloading other wrappers (d912pxy, dx9vk, reshade), it was an annoyance for me with probably daily PMs with 0x7e crash logs from users that didn't read step 1 or didn't know how to install those dependencies, it didn't provide anything for the purpose of displaying stats, and it was never allowed in the first place - technically even percentage is a status and DPS meter rules say no displaying any status and is why I likely won't reimplement anything like it in the future
---
As far as core Tyria mobs go, they really don't pose a significant challenge to an endgame player. Any functional build should have no problems taking on any standard mobs or veterans in core Tyria, even if it isn't fully optimized.
---
As far as expansion zones, fractals, or the newer event content in core Tyria like bandit champions or Awakened invasions, as you learn to play your build things stop posing so much of a challenge, but it never gets to the point of "yeah I could take on 30 of those at once" like it does in core Tyria.
---
Exotic gear is a significant step up from rares or lower and a build with exotics should be limited only by how well the weapons, stats, traits, and sigils/runes synergize with each other (which is very important in gw2). Player skill is important as well, but that should come naturally in time.
---
Not dead, just left the game for ffxiv
---
Laptop or desktop?
---
If Laptop then  it's overheating and you may have fucked up the keyboard. Use an USB one.
---
Sounds to me like you haven't done much troubleshooting and since it happens in other applications it may not even be GW2 related (except for the overheating part).
---
I think if all skills just had energy costs, no cooldowns, then 2 legends would be enough with no weaponswapping. Balance is a whole other thing, though.
---
all asura are disgusting
---
thats a true charr
---
That got me laughing too hard
---
A grand majority of old guilds are dead or inactive. WvW doesn't feel the way it used to, with mounts and a meta that many are getting bored of. PvP has even a smaller playerbase. 
---
VR moved to my home server FC and helped in the bandwagon to host server status, but I havent seen them rally for quite a long time.
---
Overall a lot of my friends have stopped playing too. The mount really was quite a terrible addition, I haven't seen the game mode bleed this many players over a short period of time, ever.
---
source: zerged 2013-2016, roamed since 2013, played on almost every server in the game
---
Certainly seems that way. Everything they've said about Shadowkeep seems positive so far
---
The rotation hasn't settled in yet so be patient for one. But for another, I come from a guild of holosmith fanatics and honestly, it did too much and recovered too easily from rotation. Holo in actuality was one of the best dps classes in terms of it's safety, flexibility, cc capability and utility. It was infuriating at how little people played other classes because holosmith was just blanket solution safety.
---
Any tips for a hairstyle with this for this look? I actually found this one one of the most appealing, there are a lot of weird ugly ones ...

Tybalt, Introduction
---
90% of the asura males that I find are literally gray and black versions of Stitch lol
---
&gt;Nothing important or worth a discussion
---
Actually mate, i think you were right. After watching what the actual f\*\*\* is going on in OCX/SEA time in TC, i think im gonna go look for a new server too. I was away like 4 days due to work commitments and got back this evening.
---
So this is what happened, there is a commander with about 10 with him. I happen to see swords on Klov and go and check. The wall is 25% and only 5 YB guys. I call for help, the comm is in between WC sentry and smc messing with BP players and does not respond. I'm like wtf, so one other person and me try to hold them and eventually die. No response from anyone else. T3 Klov lost and then after a while the comm moves to Klov to flip it back.
---
Like seriously what the acutal f\*\*\* is wrong with ppl in TC?
---
no it's a demon puppy it needs to be put down
---
One does simply get ported into GM island.
---
P.S. my dad works for Microsoft so thread lightly or I’ll have him ban you. Kek #playgroundconversations

Bloodstone home node was my best choice. I am swimming in it now, so every new hero I want to max out gets a set of bloodstone items, rest is filled with mist items, also resettable
---
Guild wars 3
---
I don't think that a fully Automatic dungeon/raid/fractal finder will work in GW2.
---
The problem is that GW2 has a more fluid profession system and every profession can potentially fit in every role. So letting the game decide what you are will be pretty complicated because what exactly does define you which role you play? Your gear your skills or traits? IIRC after HoT launch there was a time when Druid was that good in sustaining the raid group and their gear was damage oriented.
---
With Buffs, nerfs, new gear and new elite specs this automatic group finder would need to be adjusted constantly. Just imagine, a patch comes around in which the main tank is getting nerfed and now you need two or you need a totally different comp entirely.
---
&gt; raids are not very accessible because it's difficult to find a party. For this reason I believe LFR could help
---
could help, yes but what about taking the initiative and creating your own LFG? I always see posts about Dungeons being dead and yet when I did them a couple of months ago by opening my own LFG the group filled up in a matter of minutes.
---
You have a lot of options to get into raiding by joining a Training raid if you are just beginning, looking for a Raiding guild to get into a static group or just creating your own LFGs to find other pugs. All of those things require different levels of skill on your part but they are not out of reach as many might think.
---
What could work would be that someone starts an LFG with what they are looking for and other players could start a search by selecting what they are and they are put into that group depending on the roles.
---
GW2 lacks emergent gameplay to be fun to watch. The huge amount of QoL prevents fun, dumb moments for viewers. I could probably make a huge laundry list but what it comes down to is pretty much why WoW Classic is so popular right now. Classic is void of QoL but not too much to feel like a MMO from the dark ages.
---
Also, open PvP. How much I'd give to have any PvE map be a PvP map in GW2. It would be such stupid fun.
---
LFR was a mistake in WoW according to the Devs. Anet seems to learn from what they did poorly (flying mounts for example) and avoid that.
---
In GuildWars you'll never be a runaway monster secret build.  You might as well ask guildies or map chat about mechanics/skills you overhear, but don't understand.
---
Switched to ele, same thing.
---
Huh, people and companies do that? Never heard of it TBH, that's kind of cheating but surely effective. Yeah, hard to understand Anet doesn't do that then.
---
The concept of LFR fundamentally doesn't work with GW2 raids. You can't trust an automatic system to build a team when there are multiple viable team comps, power/condi favored bosses, hybrid builds, boss specific roles, and varying requirements for tanks and healers.
---
Dragonhunter: double damage vs Dragons, half damage vs everything else.
---
Scrapper: can only attack with scrap (bundles)
---
Tempest: you can only use the Tempest trait when theres a storm at your location (irl)
---
Yes, you need to upgrade your Star Platinum to Star Platinum: The World!!!
---
&gt; All the good devs are no longer with Anet
---
There's plenty of amazing developers at ANet but we did, indeed, lose a few that used to frequent this sub.
---
They're likely crazy busy, at the moment, trying to blow us away with Season 5.
---
We all realize that the purchase of gems is what keeps Anet alive, right?  I know it’s a joke how gem store items are pushed, but that’s only because there is no other source of income aside from first-time DLC purchases, which will only happen once, of course.  
---
Businesses cost money.  Without it, we have no game.
---
I guess bad joke is bad 🤷‍♂️
---
You know, you can just learn to datamine for yourself, it's not a secret technique
---
That’s what happened last year IIRC, someone made a thread with the armor chat codes.
---
Yesterday on regular patchday!
---
They affect it but for the situations where it is critical soft CCs are mostly useless
---
Rightfully so.
---
Real talk though, it occurs to me that if a mesmer shouldn't be able to use shatter skills without a clone, then a scourge shouldn't be able to use their F skills without at least one shade out.
---
Can confirm.
---
AFK'd a few LFR fights and wouldn't die.
---
btw, ingame command
---
/wiki cc
---
should be enough, because it will be redirected to your ptovided link
---
meanwhile as a scrapper main for wvw and gvg... no reveal stronk. but hey if they wanna spice it up, no complaints
---
I think people downvoted him because he’s replying seriously to a clearly ironic post.
---
That's still less DPS than exploding with PBM so even the current toolbelt lockdown doesn't close the gap between both traits.
---
And the reason is pretty obvious.
---
Making people jelly is how they make money.
---
Armour and weapons will only get you so far.
---
GW2 is more about active combat than simply gear.
---
Game industry was making better games before the gem store cash grab business model and further BS stemming from it came into being.  They can, and for years now have, put out complete trash content and still make money compared to the old way where they had damn well make it right and polish the hell out of it before release.  
---
Self preservation motivated, and rewarded, better designs.
---
Far as your inventory goes, I'd just make another character and drop that stuff on it and forget about it til you get re-acclimated to the game.  You probably don't even need it, but that way you de-clutter and have the option of searching out specific stuff with gw2efficiency later.      
---
For stuff to do, it's best to make a couple goals for yourself, and if you don't have any idea what you want yet start making some gold cause eventually you'll need it for something.  Good goal to start with would be finding a build you like for PvE and getting full ascended for it.  Use snowcrows, discretize, or metabattle to find meta builds and go from there.  Another goal, depending on how long ago you played would be getting all the mounts.  Thing is you don't have to fret about goals either, you don't *have* to do anything, it's just nice to have some incentive to work toward.      
---
Some easy things to just hop into are Fractals (just do your dailies and build up your level).  Do open world meta events.  Look here for when stuff is happening:  https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers.  Once you find some cool looking builds go through and get your hero points to unlock them.  Similarly can go through the maps and get your mastery points.  I feel like that stuff is probably the baseline for short term 'goals'.  Use https://gw2efficiency.com and the wiki to see what you haven't gotten yet / where to get it.     
---
Since you seem to be interested in pvp can just pick one on metabattle and throw it together and queue up.  You'll find out pretty quick whether that's fun for you.  WvW eh, that probably depends on what server you're on.  But you can similarly look for a build on metabattle and just grab the exotic gear for it for cheap and give it a shot.  I'll say most people just play PvE but honestly sPvP isn't terrible and you don't have to do any grind for gear or anything to just jump in.  Assuming you own the relevant expansions everything is unlocked for you already.  It's a good way to try out classes you may not have leveled yet.      
---
There's tons of stuff to do in this game, and maybe that is why it's overwhelming, but again you don't *have* to do anything which is why I recommend laying out some goals as that will give you direction.  You'll have to do this and this to get this mount, you'll have to go do this to get these ascended trinkets etc.  And if you don't want to think about it just yet then secondarily 'gold' is a good goal in the meantime and it's easy to verify your progress with.  Just see what people are doing though and tag along.  You can look for commander tags on maps or check the LFG tool.  Once you get going it'll get easier.
---
&gt; Firebrand: Lose access to weapon swap.
---
I actually really like this one - reduce the CDs of the tomes and I honestly think you have a good trade-off from CoreGuard and DH
---
&gt;ANet are likely crazy busy, at the moment, trying to blow us away with Season 5.
---
And you know this how?
---
It’s called optimism, you pessimist.
---
Yet there’s still wipes... a lot of wipes... oh god the flashbacks to madness/spine of death wing
---
IIRC, they nerfed a reaper grandmaster "Because everyone was using it". Instead of... you know.. making the other crappy ones better.
---
You using the standard fresh air build?
---
Jessica Price ruined community interaction with the devs.  That's the short n thick of it.  Anet has always been conservative with their interactions and tended to cherry-pick answers on AMA's and things like that, but the whole implicit !@#$ you, "I'm not being paid to like you anymore," really struck a nerve for the entire GW2 community -- devs and players alike. 
---
ArenaNet needs to do better.  Their current level of communication is unacceptable, and you all need to stop giving them a free pass.  Their communication policy is basically slamming the door in our faces and letting the wind blow it open when they're ready to come to show 'n tell.  Their communication policy alone is a major reason why I don't want to play this game anymore.
---
After this new outrage, I can bet you anything that in the next few days (or hours), we will get a "New to this game, I LOVE IT!" thread which mysteryously will have thousands of upvotes, reddit silver, gold and platinum in minutes.
---
Yeah, totally appropriate skills for a "thief" lmfao
---
Would be tough to implement but would surely draw more people into raids. Which in turn would help people git gud.
---
Nah they want others to see things anyways in the long run to give people something to look forward to.
---
At that point you're asking for a "this is CC" flavor text, which is unnecessary. If it impairs an enemy or tosses them around but isn't damage, it's crowd control. CC is one of the basic concepts of end game content, anyone in the game can help you out if you're unsure about which skill applies it.
---
Yeah this is never gonna happen, no idea why people keep asking for it
---
Holosmith tears are my own tears.
---
&gt;Mirage: Mirages can only have one illusion active at a time.
---
This sounds really cool, Maybe a mix of phantasm and clones so it's actually deceptive and does damage.
---
I like that idea.
---
&gt;Weaver: Lose access to offhand weapon skills.
---
Dumb
---
&gt;Scourge: Shade skills now use your own health as a resource, instead of life force.
---
Also could be interesting if they add more lifesteal into scourge.
---
&gt;Soulbeast: Permanently merged with pet. (Gains no bonus stats or skills.)
---
&gt;Deadeye: Minimum attack range 1400 (Attacks will fail if you try to attack things that are too close to you.)
---
Could work for rifle, would be pretty OP though.
---
&gt;Firebrand: Lose access to weapon swap.
---
&gt;Spellbreaker: Can only dodge once.
---
&gt;Renegade: Can't join any parties, squads or guilds.
---
Do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior, Berserker gear and Damage traits??
---
I think greatsword 5 hits with all three claws against a CC bar so is stronger than warhorn 4...
---
New feature request: cc skill Sass.
---
For power dragonhunter pve snowcrows build, do I need to change any traits or skills or rotation from the new balance update?
---
I do dungeons and fractals
---
What builds are you switching to with the changes?
---
Just wait till next year... not have a chance at all
---
The game does suffer. But havinv spherical auras was absolutely 0 reason for visual clutter. Also they seem to have forgotten about it once they started adding cosmetic cancerous auras AND legendary trinkets. Those contribute a lot more than having a purple sphere around you for 3 seconds.
---
"Open World? Oh, he's not allowed here."

*Previously on "explained on cats": [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL014PiCybzIwY6uJeXDPgrM3y03DWoAMM)*
---
The last time before this time was in 2013. I hope it becomes at least annual, I really enjoyed it.
---
I'm one of those who strongly believe that asura shouldn't have hair, like in the old days of GW1, so I'm not the best to ask.
---
while infusing it would reset its stats, that does not miraculously extend the choice of stats it offers. seriously no idea why others even suggest it in your case.
---
assuming you have no LW currencies or otherwise access to ascended back pieces... and assuming you see no use for your version's stat choices in the near future, you best course of action might be to salvage it, which grants you 60 magnetite shards that you can freely invest into whatever piece you actually need or want.
---
Load of BS. Encountered stuff like this in other MMOs. 3rd party overlays fixed it. As long as the value is retrievable which it is under the api. Haven't played in about a year but when I did I used tac0 overlay to make up for GW2 limits.
---
To dmg the break bars you have to use skills that have control effects and The Control effects are: Daze, Float, Knockback, Knockdown, Launch,  Pull, Sink, Stun, Fear1, Taunt1  (1= Fear and Taunt are both conditions and control effects.) 
---
Non-disabling control effects:  
---
Some conditions will deal damage to enemy Defiance Bar without being considered a disabling mechanic (particularly for purposes of various traits, as well as Stability). Some players refer to these conditions as "soft CC". Outside of defiance bar interaction, they serve a similar purpose as disabling control effects by hindering an opponent's actions or movement.:  
---
Blind, Chilled, Crippled,  Immobile, Slow, Weakness  
---
Certain enemies are only vulnerable to specific conditions.

---
First things first.
---
&gt; But yeah, anyhow, it's obvious you don't know what you're talking about and 
---
are covering that up with insults.
---
Literally in the same comment:
---
&gt;(yeah right, like anyone wants to play fuckin' checkers with this whiner)
---
&gt; I wonder if you'll be embarrassed when you tell your doctor that your high blood pressure came from arguing on the internet.
---
Project any harder and we could use your head as a projector in a movie theater buddy.
---
***
---
Now onto the actual comment.
---
&gt;But Reaper is incredibly self-sufficient. It doesn't need to heal in shroud.
---
&gt;If you have competent healers, you won't need to sacrifice your DPS or change your rotation, because there is 9 seconds when you're outside of shroud that your healers can do their work. ALSO let's ignore the lie that you need perfect rotations to kill raid bosses.
---
Reaper needs damage in shroud which the heal granted. The more you keep trying to justify the reaper nerf the more obvious it becomes you have no idea what you're talking about. A single hit before entering shroud negated the entire bonus and forced you to either sacrifice the rotation or the damage. You keep presenting reaper as this overpowered raid class that doesn't need any help from anet and yet mysteriously, nobody want reaper in raid groups.
---
Can you justify this contradiction?
---
Should raiders start listening to you, the reddit expert, instead of the benchmarks done by actual raider pros?
---
mystic salvage kits are way more cost efficient than the silver fed (which i also own, sadly)
---
The simple fix to this is so that taking TBM ignores locking us out of our toolbelt skills. We're still locked out of Photon Forge and we still take the DoT part of Overloading. I think it's a good compromise, given that overloading is the only way to lose heat with that trait.
---
Man, reminds me of the dark days before I discovered \[Illusionary Persona\]([https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Illusionary\_Persona](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Illusionary_Persona)).  I ran with that trait even though I barely used the rest of its trait line.  There was a reason they made that standard to all mesmers.  Now, I'd rather have it back than the entire chronomancer trait line :P  
---
Removing it takes away like 90% of the mesmer utility.  can't "oh shit gotta block this one attack".  can't "that stupid mob half a mile away gave me 3 minutes of slow, let's just remove that condition".  Can't pump out ALL THE shatters.  It takes too long to build up damage potential - now every weenie mob you have to address as a boss.  Severely reduced chrono's crowd population control capabilities.  
---
Did they know people used chrono for anything other than raid boss fights?
---
The burn zeal/virtues/x variant is top damage in wvw right now too. It drops off a little if both groups are really good, but you can't beat it for a public zerg or defending
---
[no, none at all](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Forge_Stone#Item_substitution)

ANET's refusal to add a tutorial to the personal story.

Path of exile has broken this mold somewhat however
---
I remember actually using Fire Aura as a Ranger, taking the time to drop a fire field with torch and leaping from it with Greatsword. It looked amazing and I never cared about how good or bad the dps increase was.
---
Now it's an egg. A barely noticeable egg. I no longer seek the Fire field combo and torch is gathering dust somewhere on my bank.
---
every steamer and content creator will tell you "getting into raids is easy" then tell you to go outside the game to do it. not ideal, thats why the raiding community is so small. a matchmaking system would be nice, if i could be in a queue while doing other stuff in game and be notified when the it's found me a group
---
Yes it is a very terrible engine. Some basic values aren't supported so instead of retrieving a variable value they have to do on the fly calculations. The Devs gave an example a couple years ago. Think it was either a skill or buff.
---
I suspect that's why it's also one of my 3 worse CPU hog games. The character select screen (not updating) uses more cpu resources than running around town in Skyrim.
---
I agree. I would honestly prefer the visual clutter if it means having better animations again
---
amen.  5th shatter?  makes sense and hurts but we'll live.   
---
no Illusionary Persona?  (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
---
VR moved to Ferguson's Crossing,as someone mentioned. I have seen them rally every now and then, and see players online in game. Not sure how long you've been away from the game, but wvw has changed alot over the years. There are host servers and link servers, linked servers change every 2 months. Ferguson's Crossing is now a host server. FC is currently linked to Jade Quarry, and both are full. If you want to join FC with your former guild, you can either wait and hope one of the servers will open up, or wait until next relink in about a month and join the new FC link then. Gvg scene is basically dead, wvw scene is dying, but you can still find some decent fun fights.
---
More like wishful thinking :D
---
Exactly this, having 8 peerless infusions is overkill along with other types of "general infusions." Have an armor infusion, general infusion, and a skin infusion. Maybe in 2 or 3 years we will see that happen as infusions are great money sinks for Anet until the novelty of them wears off.
---
He looks great!  And the armor is perfect
---
Whoa! In that video the spells felt so impactful and strong! I dunno if it was the sound or the angle, especially the meteor! That’s exactly what I like!
---
I tried in game and the spells feel kinda “light” and wimpy? Hard to describe.
---
&gt; Still think it should be indicated in game somehow on the skill itself...
---
the answer is, it was added late in the game cycle, in fact almost when HOT came out. It replaced a previous function and they never added information to the skills or the monsters themselves on what it is or how to "break" the bar. Usually just says "use crowd control" but there is no in-game indication of which crowd control is better than another.
---
How is the enemy able to track you for a good amount of time during Stealth, it doesn't make sense
---
can't kill a group of small mobs, can't one-off shatters (like using CS just to use your elite twice), can't easily remove nuance conditions.  it's basically ONLY good for boss battles now.
---
I'd be nice of the border of auras was an effect that was drawn on the edge of the character a few centimeters away from their skin rather than a fixed shape, like a fire aura that gives the character a fiery outline, not as if the character was burning, but as if they were surrounded by fire that can't get close enough to touch them.
---
Join the mag discord and use the bot to get marked as a mag then you can see a channel that has all the guild discords and what days they usually run org groups.  My friend has been running with MoD and he really likes it, they run a bit late for me and I was always more of a roamer so i dont usually go.

&gt; Weaver: Lose access to offhand weapon skills.
---
Staff Weaver is back, my dudes.
---
Yep, that worked. I relogged into a World Boss zone and I got the Tier 1 Rewards chest.
---
They do have a few complaints. The damage for one doesn't match the pulse intervals and not all of em.
---
\^ This. Personally Im saving them, and use them for the kits, after all, 250 charges is pretty good, and I also have copper-fed. Im also a hoarder who hasnt used almost any of the Blacklion stuff like repair canisters, bank access, etc, because, who knows WHEN I REALLY MIGHT NEED IT, or Anet releases some random new crafting/mystic forge object that require does items.
---
[Me when people think ANet will fix old content.](https://i.imgur.com/wyuaZK3.gif)
---
That would actually be an interesting effect for pvp. Force someone to use a skill they're saving. Kind of like an ability taunt. Would be fun to see an engineer fly to a random direction with rifle 5, mesmers to blink randomly etc.
---
Fashionframe is end game
---
They've completely killed the engineer class. Holo DPS (the only reason to use the elite) is a complete joke. And in the effort to make a "tanky brawler", Scrapper is now flimsier than a used tissue.
---
i had to much gold so i bought the silverfed. i ise ot together with a shared inventory slot its pretty nice.
---
i dont like gambling ,  i lsot way to much gold with it.
---
but thx for the reminder.
---
does anyone know when the expansions will be on sale?
---
Agreed on everything but shatterer. We should be encouraging people to work together on harder achieves, not making content even more brain dead. Last boss rush we had, almost every time I went to shatt, there was either a full break bar or at least one cause people finally started to try. Make encourage the habit on players by rewarding extra items at the end if the bar is broken.
---
The game already suffers from Insane visual clutter, and with the emphasis on Zerg content in this game it’s not likely to get better.  Having 100 simple animations going off is still distracting as hell.  Rather than nerfing skill animations they should be spending time on adding options to disable skill animations for other players, or preferably add options like how FF14 does it and allow you to set it to see just your parties animations, your own animations, or turn them off completely.  Then we can have the best of both worlds, crazy pretty animations AND be able to see during Zerg combat
---
As a support main who plays mostly PvP, cant wait to take this to ranked. Healing thief inc!
---
Holosmith dps was nerved by like 1.5k+, but most important change (nerf) was removing usage of toolbelt skills when you are overheated. This affect only (endgame) PvE, since whole point of its rotation and gameplay was overheating. Holo feels really weird and weak to play, not because of the lower numbers, but without your toolbelt skills being not avaiable for 60% of the fight. Its unintuitive, unfun and it took the utility and fun the class offered.
---
That being said, holo is still perfectly viable for pugging raids/t4, as every other class. But its a lot weaker and unfun than it used to be (and even before the patch, holo was average pick)
---
I mean, Runescape exists.
---
Not sure you can upkeep Merciful Ambush. Reveal makes you immune to steath. 
---
Otherwise Heal Thief might actually work. On Matt, KC, and MO you are still a Boon Thief, just with decent heals. 
---
On any other boss you can drop Deadly Arts for Deadeye and upkeep 25 might and fury for the entire raid.
---
ok then.. if a German doesn't get a fellow German's joke

that must be a bad one /s

BEHOLD!

TRUE USELESSNESS

pop in a scepter for perma illusion and voila

Absolutely no fucking damage

oh nice tool , didn't see it on the frontpage tho
---
And build templates are 'happening' allegedly.
---
Or you are bad with english, or you just not proficient enough in things you talk about.
---
Please improve your toughts with some data that proves them.
---
Nothing about the game made me quit, new games came out, friends invite ya to play and slowly moved away from it. That's about it...went from pc to xbox for a few years and now I'm getting back to my pc
---
My thoughts exactly !
---
Understandable to have hair for this guy then.
---
Few things to commend as a fellow fashion wars fanatic:
---
That's a good sum up there
---
I believe he's saying that you should use your stones to craft mystic salvage kits, and use them instead of your silver-fed for now. Once you have no more stones, put your silver-fed kit back in your shared slot.
---
Directly? No
---
August usually has some anniversary sales though if you can wait
---
Other than that, check out some of their affiliated retailers like dlgamer to see if there's anything going on there
---
Can I get an IRL setting that just hides all of the Rolexs and cars that cost over 30k? Thanks.
---
Wait for days when Mystic Forger is one of the dailies. Throw in 3 exotic weapons + Mystic Forge Stone. With the 2g and Mystic Coin from the daily rewards, you can't lose out in this exchange, but you have plenty chance to score a profit. I've gotten 2 precursors over the years just doing this for the daily.
---
It's been a day, people are still figuring stuff out
---
Oh no
---
Juggling heat kind of defeats the purpose the no-kit build had in the very first place: being simple. Besides, from my limited testing I didn't have the impression that it yields substantially more dps than the PBM build.
---
For me, no-kit holo is dead at the moment. Even sloppily playing DH yields more, so what's the point of a build that has no advantages left and has become much more annoying to play?
---
Nope, no other thief portals in my scenario.
---
You are really advocating that you need to have a better reward for 40 seconds of fighting and having to wait 10 minutes?
---
You'd only play thief in small- to medium-scale fights, but you wouldn't play ranger in any type of zerg fight, gvg, rvr, etc.
---
My honest opinion on it.. It wasn't about the nerf, it was about the flavor of the elite spec. Overheating is supposed to be a bad thing for Holo to do, so you are to get a penalty for doing so. Damage to your health just wasn't really a penalty when you can shrug it off with no care
---
Well I've been spamming SB in zerg fights and destroying squishies from across the map is pretty damn efficient. I'm not talking about guild zerg fights, just random zerg fights on EBG
---
Mirage already has a trade off- it being no dodges. And yes it actually does matter.
---
Weaver too. It’s trade off is it being the most vulnerable spec in the game.
---
Scourge doesn’t have a shroud form.
---
Soulbeast is obviously no pet.
---
Deadeye i dont really know. It being very static?
---
Holosmith didn’t get a “new” trade off. It got nerfed. Simple as that. (if that is your reason for this post)
---
Firebrand. idk also, doesn’t really seem to have drawbacks besides it being almost fully focused on support not dps.
---
Spellbreaker in of itself is a trade off.
---
Renegade is flat out better than core and herald.... deserves a trade off in form of no weapon swap.
---
TP condi options suck, but carrion is probably your best option there. With HoT obviously vipers is BiS by a long shot, with only PoF I guess trailblazers is ok. If you want to do raids you must have vipers though, it’s really not an option. For open world anything goes so just take carrion and go crazy I guess.
---
Even on the other team?  If there's no thieves on the other team, then yeah, but if there were they might've been disrupting you without you knowing.  Or, likely, without them knowing either.
---
But you can outrun them with Meld with Shadows which is minor in SA and shadowsteps both from utilities and those inherent in some specs like Deadeye. Its really l2p for a Thief to get away from damage while invisible.
---
... where are the infusions? It isn't fashion wars if i can see the outline of the player model /s
---
i'm convinced anet won't be happy until it's entirely useless/less effective than other options
---
I do use sword and focus, but I hate the Idea of any weapon not doing well especially when they're tied to an Elite Spec.
---
If Anet would stop hovering over Engineer and Mesmers they could make some useful changes.
---
I think the issue is largely that Anets testers are part of the Low-Skill group
---
With all the renaming/redoing of core trait lines lately, I almost wonder if we're going to be getting some sort of new "core" specializations to make core builds more competitive.
---
Pvp skills are split though
---
This.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
However, it can be put into material storage so it can be transferred between characters.  Just not between accounts (e.g. yours to cousin).
---
Yes I personally think mesmers will ALWAYS be meta. They are anets faivorute.
---
If my memory serves me right, you get one pet out of door with ranger. Necro will get around 3 minions around lvl20. Its axe is ridiculous overpower in lvl10 and below. I am struggling with Mesmer and Warrior under lvl20 when solo bosses/mobs. Had a hard time not to get killed in Demongrub Pits with lvl around 10.
---
-
---
I get **Not My Pet** all the time, because I love solo bosses/mobs. Run away is 80% of the time.
---
Necro on the other hand is most newbie solo forgiving class. You will die sometimes, but it is a learning experience.
---
This is what I theorized too. But using blasting module, the focus of the dps spec, still gives an ok dps, at the costing of using the holoforge in the most risky way possible. It have its trade off. It they want diversity they should buff the other two traits. I understand that the 150% heat trait is used for a more safe build and I've seen it being used in open world. But I've never seen the first one being used or recommended.
---
When I see a stacked infusion, I'm not jelly. I'm mad, my eyes are hurting and I'm trying to turn my camera away asap.
---
Only the Revealed effect.
---
Deflecting shot is supposed to be more of a utility than damage. Personally I'd like to see the autoattack bounce made 3 targets OR bounce regardless of positioning
---
no, all of the "uniqueness" of the class got moved to other classes or nerfed into the ground
---
alacrity used to be a unique chrono only buff, now it's a boon that multiple classes can give instantly
---
massive distort was replaced with a single stack of aegis
---
mimic is a shadow of it's former self
---
SoI used to be the only way to mass share every boon in the game, now it only extends the length of boons that are already there
---
chrono has gone from a necessary part of any squad to the thing other classes are trying to do instead. other classes inherited what the previous versions of chrono used to do all while chrono gets nerfed/reworked
---
They nerf us and we will find again a way how to be op. Every patch the same.
---
This makes an elementalist seem godly but in actual fact they are paper as you cannot believe and staffs are so frowned upon it’s not even funny
---
I haven't been keeping up with the game since skyscales got added, what are these abilities?
---
Can we ban that troll already?
---
I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted. Guild Wars 2 has always been relatively bad at teaching players things like this.
---
Bare minimum you need to spend gems on the living stories you missed, their context is... necessary.
---
You also need more than 1 bank slot, more than 250pc material storage (I bought 2 for up to 750pc per mat), a set of infinite tools, and an infinite salvage kit. The account backpack is extremely useful for the latter two, but you need 4 slots for the kit and tool set.
---
It never did. Sniff will show non-stealthed players in a certain radius as orange dots on your personal minimap. Other players can't see this, it doesn't detect players in stealth, it doesn't reveal players in stealth or prevent them from stealthing.
---
That would be okay. I much rather get the option where if I block someone they then their character models will always be culled.
---
But their ugliness would surface :-D
---
XD
---
You think maybe you're acting a bit childish? I mean I get that people love to defend their game, but it's just a single rather old MMO at this point, and it **does** have plenty remaining class design and balance issues that could be worked on. And I just think that it needs a purity pass:
---
1. Decide what are the core 2-3 values each class brings to the game.
---
2. Decide which extra 1 value each elite spec brings or whether it replaces one.
---
3. Prune things and refocus no the target values.
---
Core virtues are instant, DH virtues aren't. Core f1 allows allies to burn a foe which can be useful in PvE. DH f1 has cast time so can be dodged. DH f3 has longer cooldown than core guard. In competitive modes DH f2 can get interrupted and heals in a smaller area. The tradeoffs are not always relevant, but they are there.
---
FB has more proper trade offs, in that the tome cooldowns are huge and you need to commit to a tome to get its benefits (e.g. stowing the tome before pages run out is a loss).
---
The tradeoffs they put on Holo overheat and Chrono shatters are just retarded, a tradeoff should not prevent or limit people from using core mechanics.
---
Oh, ok cool.
---
You dont want them hovering over your class, unless you want nerfs.
---
That phrasing is a bit unfortunate. Hard CCs apply instant breakbar damage whereas soft CCs apply breakbar damage over time.
---
As a power chrono, last patch had already depleted my will to play the game, when they removed the aftercast continuum split shenanigans. Now I simply have no will to play anymore. Power chrono suffered tremendously due to boon chrono's prowesses.
---
Seriously, it's been a month since I last played this game and I was thinking about getting back in. Still, I have no desire to do so, due to these changes.
---
I remember the years when game boxes had to specify what kind of hardware they were developed to run on because there were few, if any, hardware standards.  Back then putting a game with some massive flaw on the market could only be remedied by issuing new disks with patched code to people who bought the flawed version.
---
That is undeniably true. I don't to interact with people who do that. It's the same as the assholes that would blast their music at max volume in the middle of the night.
---
Must be a cat. One more life to go
---
Totally didn't just read "We need a GFX Setting to limit Player **Asuras**"

I really don't understand the change to auras. Aren't you supposed to be able to tell that an enemy has a shocking aura, so that you don't wreck yourself

If this ever happened i can see cosmetic infusion prices tanking because thats the whole point of them its lazy fashion wars but hey some people like that just dont let them stack the only one that really hurts the eyes is the bioluminescent one.

Also happy cake day

The world boss portal. It portals you to the nearest point. That you have discovered or just the nearest?

i'd rather not, because then people wouldn't be able to appreciate [my cryptid](https://i.imgur.com/EkJzbW7.png) nearly as much
---
people have always been able to use obnoxious dyes and various color effects (hylek potions)
---
if someone wants to look like trash, let them
---
I luckily have been logging in and getting them for free cept for one of them. Think its the very first one
---
Exactly - there are so many mechanics that aren’t explained to the players; I only know what I do because I constantly check reddits and wikis. Bringing my gf into this game, I have to witness someone that doesn’t check achievements, dye their armor, change their weapons (soldier gear axe shield warrior for life), update their armor and skills, and approach breakbars the right way!
---
Its fun haha but I wish the game would highlight how important these things are.
---
It's fine. Even the bosses where you need distort the most for tanking, like Peerless and Deimos, you still have plenty of other blocks and evades. The most annoying part of the change is watching allies get hit by attacks once your signets are on cooldown, on bosses like Samarog and Conjured Amalgamite.
---
Have you seen the outcry of chronos after literally every patch? If they had legendary armor they would not care as they would have free switching. That's that.
---
Well ye, if you just care about gold value and nothing else, then it is costly, but I don't think it is good way to look at it. You either have fun or not, and if those gamemodes are not fun at all, then probably better to stay away from all legendaries altogether :)
---
Cum on guys.. ofc it's annoying.. but, it all depends on what rank you play and how good you are in the class anyways.. cause the overheating was a problem that get punished by other players anyways if you are not playing in broze, silver or gold.. so the overheating is kinda targeted to play your class better.. which is good in my opinion ;) 
---
Where it's rly getting annoying is in raids and the rotation there.. but that's a other story :)
---
Hey man they worked hard for those auras, so I will be keeping everything on high at all times so that work doesn't go to waste.
---
The joke falls apart when you realize most of these had trade offs since release
---
"Should raiders start listening to you, the reddit expert, instead of the benchmarks done by actual raider pros?"
---
The benchmarks are identical before and after the patch because the trait's damage has not changed. You keep lying about this and I'm not going to respond anymore to this.
---
"A single hit before entering shroud negated the entire bonus and forced you to either sacrifice the rotation or the damage."
---
Why are you taking that hit? Why is your support not keeping you topped off? Why does this justify violating the interaction between healing and shroud that's been in the game since launch and continues to be the standard for core necro?
---
"You keep presenting reaper as this overpowered raid class that doesn't need any help from anet and yet mysteriously, nobody want reaper in raid groups."
---
You continue to lie about this as well. I'm no longer going to engage on this. Reaper is obviously underpowered in raids. The devs seem to very clearly have Reaper as a "solo" class that provides most of what it needs by itself which makes it weaker in raids.
---
If you lie about this again, I'm simply not going to continue this. You don't seem to care about having a discussion, you just want to insult people and lie about their arguments.
---
The changes in PvP are very minor. Unless you were pulling off noscope 180 net shots literally nothing's changed.
---
Definitely read that as "Asuras".....
---
I agree though with having the option to mute aura effects of other players!
---
And human female idle animations
---
Ad someone with photosensitive epilepsy. Gods yess! Also, season 3 is a fucking nightmare for me... some missions have so many effects, spinning walls, and more that it took me teaching my bf to play MMOs and looking up the transcription from the Wiki to finish it... today... I litterally gave been at it until today.
---
So I already have a guardian that I can switch between DH and Firebrand. I wanted to make another heavy toon but cannot seem to decide between a warrior or revenant.
---
Looking at recent patch notes, both of them seem to have been buffed. Which one is easier to get a grip on? Fractals or raids preference doesn't matter.
---
\*distortion deleted from the game\* fucking ree. Theres so so many invulns in the game, so many ways to share aegis with many classes and yet the entire mech- I'm going to stop whilst I'm behind.
---
Nearest, it will unlock if you don’t have on that character.
---
I get the feeling that there are no shortage of people who might be willing to pay anet to remove auras from their own view.  And if it gets made with fine enough control, I might be too.
---
I dont play necro that much so I played around with it when I read about the change to see what everyone was up in arms about. I dont get it. I played around in the open world and dungeons and losing the crit from vuln felt was worse than gaining the 5%heal and 10% dmg.
---
Third-party overlays aren't the GUI, though. You could even solve this with a 3rd party overlay in Gw2.
---
yea just drag the entire group down for imaginary sustain
---
IDK, the new monetization would be to pay to remove others auras from my screen.
---
Everyone disagreeing with me says they don't want a year without new content. And that makes sense, the game already feels stale a lot. 
---
I think a year of polish would be new content. No new maps, but enough updates to existing old content that breathes new life into it. The game feels stale because everything except the new stuff they add is old stuff. They don't spend much time keeping older stuff current. So you do the new LS episode then you're back where you started. But what if they actually made changes and improvements to the world so it didn't feel so stale? 
---
Look at world boss rush and shiny weapons. What if they had combined that with updates to many WB mechanics? It would have been a much bigger hit. 
---
Or personal story. What if they do some QA on personal story and also either add some new achieves or keys or something so existing players will want to at least take a look at what's new?
---
So for me a year without new content really means a year of not putting a tonne of developer time into building a new living story episode or 2 from scratch. Put all that time into revamping old shitty heart quests, fleshing out open world event chains in places, etc etc. I think I could still enjoy that and it would be so good for new players who right now basically see PoF released 2017 and then realize they're playing core gw2 released 8 years before that.
---
&gt;unironically bashing Exordium

You have shit taste, lmfao
---
Huh, y'know I'm not positive, but I think its the closest waypoint period, I'll test and get back to ya.

&gt;you just want to insult people and lie about their arguments.

---
You're so full of shit your eyes are brown.
---
&gt; "Should raiders start listening to you, the reddit expert, instead of the benchmarks done by actual raider pros?" The benchmarks are identical before and after the patch because the trait's damage has not changed. You keep lying about this and I'm not going to respond anymore to this.
---
Scholar's uptime HAS been nerfed. Reaper can no longer heal in shroud, making it harder for him to reach the benchmark.
---
&gt;You keep lying about this and I'm not going to respond anymore to this.
---
Ah, so you got called out on your bullshit, ergo you're not gonna respond anymore. 
---
&gt;"A single hit before entering shroud negated the entire bonus and forced you to either sacrifice the rotation or the damage." Why are you taking that hit? 
---
Because in this game enemies try to kill you.
---
&gt;Why is your support not keeping you topped off?
---
Because support can't heal you in shroud.
---
&gt;Why does this justify violating the interaction between healing and shroud that's been in the game since launch and continues to be the standard for core necro?
---
You're wrong on several accounts here:
---
1.) Its not actually the standard for core necro. Core necro can heal with the vampirism signet and the blood magic trait line.
---
2.) Reaper is an elite spec, not core necro.
---
3.) What's wrong with violating that interaction? Its not a sacred bond, its a leftover mechanic that was put in the game before healers became abundant, as the rest of the game evolves, so should the classes if they want to be able to keep up.
---
&gt;"You keep presenting reaper as this overpowered raid class that doesn't need any help from anet and yet mysteriously, nobody want reaper in raid groups." You continue to lie about this as well. I'm no longer going to engage on this. 
---
Don't engage then. You've been spouting horseshit from the start, nothing of value will be lost if you stop.
---
&gt;If you lie about this again, I'm simply not going to continue this.
---
So you mean if I call out your bs again you're not going to continue this. Bye bye felicia. Nothing of value will be lost.
---
Well thankfully the one constant thing of engie is that "condi builds = top DPS" LOL
---
And I could always use harrier gear on a druid or something yeah?
---
Necro is viable in almost all content, you may be expected to play a support healer in raids depending on the rest of your team's composition. 
---
Given that you played previously and have been "bored" with previous content I'd say use the 80 boost and just start working through PoF content and Living story seasons to get used to the game again. Necro is a low skill floor class so you should be able to pick it up even gaining access to everything at 80 all at once. 
---
Getting characters to level 80 is generally not that difficult (you get ten level up tomes free every 28 days anyway) so I wouldn't stress too much about deleting the old characters.
---
I wasn't trying to be nasty. For me it was pretty obvious because of my build. I have a couple of toolbelt DPS skills that have a 7 second CD. I wait until I overheat and use those skills for maximum DPS. I then use prime light beam if it's not on cooldown and photon wall and after a few seconds I use the 2 toolbelt skills again. Just before the cooling completes, most times I can get off another of the 2 toolbelt skills. There was a bit of downtime but it wasn't a lot. Now I just sit there waiting for 15 seconds after my prime light beam and photon wall. It's dumb.
---
Well when you’re done send me your mats and then delete your characters and put it on YouTube
---
My group ran raids yesterday post patch with dual chrono, one a tank. It is basically the same and works fine. Nothing has really changed, and chrono is still immensely strong.
---
What group?
---
Ascalon Catacombs and Open World?
---
Somehow he'll remain meta, before being nerfed to shit in a patch 3 months from now, aftewards he will also remain the meta.
---
Another issue with the spaguetti code, created without the idea of futur changes. So when they want to make a change it takes them 1 year because they need to redo all the code for this specific area.
---
That's not what I'm saying.
---
I'm saying that as an elite mechanic, function gyro doesn't add much of anything to engineer. Setting F5 to function gyro is a hell of a tradeoff already. The inherent -300 vit is going too far.
---
I didn't say Chrono got displaced as the best tank, I just said tank Chrono got more annoying.
---
no im asking why if you dont want the class to have a weapon swap....then just dont weapon swap
---
Necro is strong everywhere, and their HoT elite spec Reaper is [really fun to play and easy to gear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aczrz4FavHU) - just full Berserker gear, with optionally some Valkyrie mixed in). And Scourge is strong in groups, makes hard content (Raids, high level Fractals, etc) much easier for the group. And both specs are arguably the best for solo'ing in the game, which is useful when you're doing Living World story instances and other stuff alone.
---
And yes use your 80 boost. The original pre-expansion leveling content is pretty boring now, HoT and PoF content is much more fun and interesting. Watch /r/guildwars2 for announcements of sales on HoT, they get posted here periodically.
---
Also - stop deleting characters you've put time into leveling, unless you've filled up your character slots and really want a different class.
---
And don't forget the gliders!
---
And the legendary weapons!!!
---
And the chaos gloves!!!
---
And the shiny outfits (like Balthazar)
---
And pretty much 90% of the exclusive dyes!!!
---
I think people asking for this are a (very vocal / annoying) minority.
---
If all that stuff was the "unbearable eye cancer" they say it is, they wouldnt be the price they are. Super bright dyes, infusions and shiny stuff are expensive because (most) people like them, and they let you showoff your (wealth/dedication/prestige) to others.
---
I seriously think people that make this kind of post are just salty they can't have them.
---
Deleting your characters is a huge mistake.  The game rewards you with annual birthday gifts on each character's birthday, with exclusive dyes, level-up tomes, backpacks and even an armour set on the sixth birthday.  If you're deleting characters you're setting yourself back in being able to get all these items.  Don't feel forced to play something you're not enjoying, but you should at least keep it around to collect free stuff with it.
---
You can also try to use different weapons or a different build to revitalize interest in a character you find stale.
---
Losing distortion is nothing? Interesting.
---
Sometimes it takes them one year twice
---
I really liked how it was done in GW1's missions and dungeons. We could use the same method, but with the addition of CMs:
---
* Story mode that gives rewards just once per character and it's scaled to be soloable, but the combat mechanics would remain almost exactly the same as Normal mode, and sure-kill attacks that are guaranteed to one shot players will remain the same. Other than reduced and scaled stats on enemies, mechanics will only change when they are impossible to do solo, to be doable for parties of any size. 
---
* Normal mode with recurring rewards, with dialogs that would slow down the progress stripped or cut, and no cinematics to skip, NPCs would just talk on the move instead. 
---
* CM mode with extra difficulty and mechanics that gives rewards the first time it's done, then gives rewards again once in a while, but not as often as normal mode, like when it has has the weekly call of the mists for raids, or when it's a daily in fractals and dungeons. 
---
* For story instances, only those that are long enough and/or have bosses interesting enough would get dungeon modes. A small dungeon icon would appear in the map, allowing you to play the dungeon mode without having to reset, restart or replay the story.
---
* For fractals, the 'story' mode would be T0. 
---
* For dungeons, the story paths would be integrated in personal story at the appropriate point of the story (when you get a mail about it from your Destiny's Edge friend). But they would remain in dungeons playable as dungeon mode. Explorable paths would either remain as dungeon mode only, or be playable once in story mode as 'side stories' for one-time rewards. Kind of like sidequests. 
---
That way we'd get more than twice the content with less than twice the work.
---
But... all the fashion wars guy has to do is plug in a credit card ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The other posters gave decent detail on how to get leggy armor from PvP/WvW, but to answer the question of why it's easier: because you can do it solo, and being bad doesn't lock you out, just makes it a little inefficient. 
---
WvW especially, you just need to get up to the participation level where you start earning pips, then you can either just follow a commander around, if there is one, or go to an empty map and flip camps/sentries.  Now, I find WvW really boring if you aren't actually participating in your server's community, but the option is there.  Takes a lot longer to get than doing raids, and it's  not a unique skin, but you also don't need to get a group together or learn a boss, so it's something you can do while multitasking or something.
---
&gt;Setting F5 to function gyro is a hell of a tradeoff already.
---
Eh not really, it changes virtually nothing in regards to how ridiculous they were to kill.
---
PvP Bunker Scrapper uses hammer and the build used to be top tier before some minor nerfs. The build was still decent before yesterday's patch.   
---
The build was much more popular than PvP Longbow Dragonhunter or WvW Longbow Dragonhunter.
---
If you truly watched the streams you would know Teapot and pretty much everyone on their podcast stated time and time again they would absolutely recommend this game to any player looking for an MMO and admit Gw2 is one of the best MMO. 
---
However turning a blind eye to the problems of the game aint gonna help nobody. It is true WvW / Raids development is way too slow. WvW stuck on the same meta for 2 years, and raiders wait 9 months between releases to get a ring that looks just the same as the fking open world ring and a raid cleared in 1:30 hours. (Its one of my favorite raids in terms of design but its 9 months of wait we talking about here). 
---
Its these game modes that grow a community, that grow a scene, that give visibility to the game. And we're loosing it all. Teapot and the likes simply stated that the game could be much better if it gave more focus to the competitive modes since those modes grow a scene. Right now Gw2 is going full steam on the living world content, which is amazing content, but single player content, in an MMO. Just not good enough for the amazing game we have.
---
what's the point of having different classes if the end goal is for all of them to be a viable option? flare?
---
Boon healing thief is already the meta solo healer for both Matthias and MO even before this change, as evidenced by dP's Matthias all time record and our (iS) MO patch record a couple months ago. This particularly doesn't change anything for MO because you can't use Merciful Ambush on deadeyes as it will mess up their rotation.
---
As for KC boon thief is garbage, unless you're ok waiting ~20 seconds each phase before you get boons since only the adds give plasma.
---
it isn't intrinsically a "casual game", it's a game that has something for casuals to do. It may have become a casual game circumstantially but it certainly wasn't always like this, and it doesn't need to be like this.
---
Eh, not quite, you're drawing conclusions from limited data.
---
A 15% increase in revenue doesn't mean that 15% more people are playing the game, it just means on average, Anet is making 15% more in rev. If I had to guess, the introduction of mount skins is the main difference between hot and pof earnings, they're expensive and you see them all over the place.
---
An 8% increase on efficiency is also useless information. You don't know when that information in the infographic was recorded, and that post likely drove additional traffic to the site (resulting in more registered accounts). Whenever the Exchange subreddit is discussed on here, I also see a massive influx of traffic, new posts, and subscribers, it has nothing to do with the amount of people playing the game.
---
&gt;Just because you feel like your favourite game mode isn't doing well right now
---
Right now, that's people who play raids, dungeons, PvP, and WvW who are unhappy. That's a lot of game modes that just aren't in a good state right now.
---
I think the crux of the issue is that the established, veteran, and hardcore players are the ones more likely to discuss the game on outside platforms like Reddit, Twitch, and Youtube. For them, the game is doing poorly, because it fails to deliver enough content that these players desire, and it fails to address the issues that they care about.
---
The game is continuing to capture the attention and dollars of the casual crowd who just use the game solely as a fashion and gathering game, and this group spends huge amounts of money on outfits and mount skins.
---
The game, as a game, is suffering tremendously and the people who care about it as a game are feeling forgotten. The game as a whale-focused, skins-for-cash marketplace is doing as well as ever.
---
&gt; Give Anet a little more credit, stay patient and trust them a little more.
---
I'm hearing this argument since 2013. When is the cut off date for you? 2077?
---
Sooo, no distorting VG Greens to make it easier for your Druid to heal the rest of the group?
---
No distorts on Gorse or KC to prevent Knockdown? 
---
Preventing Sloth's Shake?
---
I mean, sure, you don't need to do that if your only objective is to survive, but if you aim to be a good tank, your goal lies far beyond just surviving the encounter.
---
I wanted to get a couple of zealot thieves with Shadow Shot D/P and have both merciful ambush and shadow savior on. I went down in pvp as i popped SR and popped right back up, was amazing.
---
it must be nice to still have hope after being disappointed over and over again
---
shadow shot better, uses less initiative, but in a perfect world you can just shadowstep backwards after already being on your target so you get 2x shadowsteps for double healz. maybe...maybe a swindler healer?
---
This is one of my biggest gripes with Reddit mob mentality - they pretend the game is fine.
---
ArenaNet's communication has been poor since they lost a lot of staff, ArenaNet funded other projects when they should have been funding development for our game. 
---
Guild Wars 2 client remains one of the most unoptimised pieces of shits on the MMO market, even BDO fixed their glaring issues after 2 years. 
---
ArenaNet released the worst kind of content; time-gated pseudo content. Keep players on the map as long as possible through locked mechanics/time gating so it looks like the content is doing "well" to shareholders. 
---
* Dungeons are dead, farming spots are nerfed regularly, you make more gold in 1h of working than 10 hours of farming. 
---
* The TP is buyer controlled. 
---
* You literally can't correct misinformation on the forums without being reported as "bullying".
---
* Raids are stale, the mechanics are shit and can be cleared within a single day and underwhelming rewards.
---
ArenaNet is not investing in the client, they are not investing in the content, they are only invested into the gem store - which admittedly, has had more updates than **any** content to date.
---
Conclusion:
---
Earnings are indicative of whales, impulse buying (as mentioned) and bi-weekly gem store updates. That-shaman builds up gem store hype for the upcoming releases, which is why they allow him to continue to post information about it.
---
ArenaNet is sitting on their hands for too long, they have grown comfortable in that their game has not gone P2W and people still play it. More and more people will quit, I want to come back, but I simply can't.
---
Am I happy people lost their jobs? No. 
---
Am I happy that ArenaNet lost a massive staff investment due to pure negligence of their biggest earner? Yes.
---
Do I see a future for Guild Wars 2? Not really, we keep getting excuses and they're not going away. 
---
\&gt; the code is spaghetti
---
\&gt; client is too old
---
\&gt; engine is too old
---
\&gt; raid mechanics have to be casual
---
\&gt; story can't be tied to raids
---
\&gt; we can't do gear treadmill or go higher than ascended.
---
\&gt; we can't make changes to the base engine due to original developer being gone.
---
\&gt; we can't add a dye slot onto legendary armor, despite advertising it.
---
\&gt; we can't invest into a guilds developer.
---
\&gt; fractals are dungeons so we don't need to update them anymore.
---
\&gt; we must nerf every farming spot available that doesn't drain your soul, we'd rather you work than play our game.
---
\&gt; mob mentality shows arenanet they're doing a good job, anyone with a fucking brain knows this game can make stellar changes with simple tools.
---
Even an official LFG tool for dungeons, with extra rewards for using them, would make a massive difference to community play. *but hey, don't want to copy Wow.* (Despite every major MMO having a queue system, successfully.)
---
For raids: no support and tank chrono is still very viable and not much difference after the update. 
---
For solo pve: it's still good but not AS good imo. I really miss the self shattering. Especially distortion with no clones. 
---
For roaming WvW and sPvP: Kiss bursting goodbye. You can sorta burst but requires using clones and to make F1 any good, you'll need Slow on your target. Very annoying.
---
F3 is a bit stronger but like I said: it's not that great for bursting any more. 
---
For WvW zerg support: it's still really good. And the combination of distortion and CS makes it less tedious to have multiple clones to use both. But like I said before: having clones is now a requirement.
---
For T4 CM fracs: it's still just as viable as raiding. You'll do just fine with support and power builds but with slightly more annoyance with the clone problem.
---
All in all: Chrono is still great in everything besides soloing pve content and nerfed hard in pvp and WvW roaming (which I feel it didn't deserve seeing as Mirage outshines Chrono in these areas. And this is coming from a Chrono-user since HoT dropped &amp; core Mesmer up until HoT. I do love Mirage in PvP and WvW even after their nerfs not too long ago.
---
Either way: take this all with a grain of salt seeing as this is my personal opinion on how it changed for me and my experience. It'll vary from person to person for sure!
---
They're not technically break break, but all deplete the bar based on the skills you have on hand.  
---
If hard cc skills, they deplete the bar down faster, almost instant if mob is elite vs half to 2/3 for a champ for instant.  
---
Your elite golem is great, low cool down.  
---
On your gs, skill 5 is hard cc cuz the pull, plus chill condition, skill 4 is pulsing cripple, so it's a soft cc.  
---
In your reaper shroud, skill 5 is a stun, plus apply chill condition. And this skill lasts 4s so it's a huge hard cc, very deadly in PvP and wvw if used right. Your skill 3 is a hard cc too, but you have to shatter it to be able to get the fear.  
---
Any skill that hinder target movement is soft cc. Like cripple, chill, immobilized. Skills that will move targets around like knockdown, knockback, launch, pull, fear are hard cc. Stun, daze that stop target from moving is hard cc too.  
---
Just think of it like hard hitting the target teal bar. Since he's unlike other mob, has the bar, he won't move around but his bar get hit and can be depleted or broken down. Hope it helps.
---
If revenue means anything...EA games should be top tier
---
Thanks for this, I will replace it with the link that I posted originally.
---
Lowest model limit is both necessary for and also a nightmare for world bosses and metas. You need it for fps and to hopefully help prevent the game from crashing, but it's awful because enemies, even bosses, aren't given preference over friendlies. I've been one-shot many times by Axemaster Hareth because the game thought he wasn't worth rendering.
---
A more in-depth system of horizontal progression. If we’re not going to have fear resets, then slowly building and improving our characters is the way to go.
---
It's honestly just completely insane to me that they've moved so far away from dungeons. I was never really riding the dungeon dick, especially not during early HoT since raids actually got released regularly, but Releasing a one-path dungeon with every living story episode with a hard mode would instantly make pretty much every hardcore pve-er happy--CERTAINLY happier than getting a deepstone or siren's reef every few months. There's no way in hell they can't afford the staff--why are we only getting a raid or fractal every three months? how thin is the skeleton crew?
---
On another note, the only thing I can say in favor of the current system regarding endgame content development is that the raids are *really* polished and quite mechanically interesting, they're just dramatically undertuned. They're some of the only comprehensively well-put together content in the game, imo, and the fact that they're largely self-contained helps them maintain that air.
---
yep gw2hook precisely
---
What made GW2 the success it was when it released. It was different, it didn't copy the boring gameplay of WoW and that worked for them. They need to go back to this and if the can make Living story feel impressive it could work. Now that 100% focus has been put back on GW2 hopefully this helps bring GW2 back up. But I highly doubt GW2, WoW, Final Fantasy and ESO will ever be removed as the top 4 MMOs.
---
I see no issues with auras unless you're using settings like "post-processing"  
---
Also character limit should be set to "lowest" in most instances. Low if you want to see the commander and/or have a Dx12 mod.
---
&gt; A 15% increase in revenue doesn't mean that 15% more people are playing the game
---
I never even said that. I just said that they seem to be doing fine financially
---
&gt; An 8% increase on efficiency is also useless information. You don't know when that information in the infographic was recorded, and that post likely drove additional traffic to the site (resulting in more registered accounts)
---
I said that it only *hints* at a growing player base, not that it proves it. iirc though, I checked gw2efficiency at that time and the numbers weren't far off. Sure the post drew attention to the website, but definitely not enough to increase an already well-known sites registered accounts by 8%.
---
&gt; If GW2 was growing at a substantial rate, Anet would be shouting it from the mountain tops.
---
With this I agree. I don't think they're breaking records at the moment, but I'm still convinced that they grow enough to be fine.
---
That's what Standard Enemy Model was made for.
---
hey, HoT was actually good for the first few months. Really good. Waiting in 2013 wasn't too braindead a call.
---
for VG, Gorse, KC you have signets, and sloth is an general issue not just tank chrono
---
tbh you don't need to, all classes are "good" but none are quite like guard imo
---
For me, playing ESO was more like playing Skyrim but with more interesting combat. I played solo almost exclusively and paid attention to quest lines and dialog. I think ESO feels a bit more like a world than GW2 does, but GW2 events are better than anything either ESO of FFXIV has done in open world, other than ESO story.
---
FFXIV has much better difficult content and way more customizable UI and other options. Also it really leans on that Final Fantasy aesthetic so if you really like that over GW2's, you'll prefer FFXIV. But FFXIV's leveling system is horrible and it's reliance on story for gameplay is both a strength, and a weakness.
---
 wow implemented it for the first time but now other mmo use it too ( ffxiv for example ).
---
distorting greens on VG? what year is it? sure you can save yourself a spike but your healer would still have to heal everyone else.
---
but i admit having to dodge the sloth shake like a peasant instead of proudly standing there without a care while the beast throws balls of shit at you and your friends made me feel bad.
---
Yeah, it seems weird. Even when ANet employees play the game they use the wiki as the go-to source for info related to the game. You can even type /wiki in the chat box. I guess it's part of the game design.
---
While we are at it, let us remove the aura Koda’s Warmth just as we remove glyphs from gathering tools (and make it ascended at least lol, it’s fine quality right now...)
---
Sure, but you could do that. It'd be an option.
---
I think this might be related to wardrove, perhaps they are adding backpacks and trinkets as items that can be transmuted, maybe even auras included since they are also "items". 
---
I feel it is less likely to be Build Templates^(tm) since I feel they would save that for something like an expansion selling point, or pre-expansion patch to bring the hype back.
---
Sorry, been a minute since I logged in. What greatsword is that?
---
These, in my opinion, are the things that need to be done: 
---
- more difficulty tiers on instanced content
---
- better reward structure (bit more benevolent with the cosmetics, especially for challenging content, but also with LS) --&gt; it is CRUCIAL that the game has a layer of attractive rewards that are neither a breeze nor TOO hard / a pure RNG fest to get. 
---
Yes, you need to earn money, but your current monetization is not the recipe of your financial success, it's the fact that people tolerate it because they like your game. ffs, fine, keep the lootboxes. 
---
Good example for decent rewards: Requiem Armor (minus the Sigil business, perhaps), Skyscale (with some twists). Raid rewards should be more generous. Many rewards should have identity, /no one cares/ about the things that you have because of a mere gold grind. Dhuum throne was good, more stuff like that! 
---
- much better tutorialization for classes and elite specs so that people that actually have interest in endgame content don't whine as much about how they don't want to get good for it.
---
- with progression not being gear based, these people will always exist, however --&gt; Anet needs to blend them out. better tutorialization per game mode and better rewards are enough
---
- wait no, they are not, I have forgotten about guilds. Well, so has Anet. GUILD REWORK, WHEN?
---
- war supply drop was a stupid beating around the bush. be brave and just make it an optional sub with the money returned in gems and with small convenience perks that reward active play. in ESO, no one bats an eye. the game is still b2p when the sub is optional, so all good. 
---
- more daring marketing showcasing what good features they have (mounts and their functions, non-gear-based PvP, the beauty of its maps etc.) 
---
- Maybe a referral system to go with their word-of-mouth philosophy
---
- they need to keep up the consistent communication that they have established after the layoffs
---
- major content bundle releases sound great at first but releasing stuff in intervals is much more beneficial to the game. (LS only interesting for two weeks? then release the fractal two weeks later, not on the same day. And keep it up with the event weeks in between.)
---
- more frequent/comprehensive instanced content releases. 
---
A lot of this likely goes against Anet's philosophies. But yeah, that's what needs to be done.
---
That’s a wild idea. Paying money to remove stuff. I like it.
---
It's fine to be upset. It's fine to not like stuff. It sucks when a part of the game you like is getting ignored.
---
But almost every fucking time someone makes a thread about the stuff they don't like, they always attach an vague assertion or arbitrary statement like:
---
* "This is why the game is dying."
---
* "This is why Anet is struggling."
---
* "Anet is on life support."
---
* "They don't care any more."
---
So, yes, there's plenty of discontent with stuff like balance, update pacing, endgame pve, pvp systems, wvw updates. There are people who are genuinely upset new hair styles and faces haven't been added in a long time just the same as there are people upset about a lack of new weapon types. Some of these concerns are just what you *want* for the sake of having it and some of these concerns are genuinely in the interest of building up the game.
---
But the moment they throw in one of those aforementioned lines, their post is just bullshit trying to justify its bullshit with bullshit.
---
The game is in a weird place. It never made promises of being a hardcore anything or a WoW-killer or whatever. It aimed to be a comfy middle ground as a product to generate a profit for a studio to then go on and keep functioning. Some people expect more and more of it as they come from other games which had more or they've been around for such a long time that they build up unrealistic expectations. To top it all off, it is true that things have slowed down significantly and this game is the better half of a decade old.
---
I just don't get why people keep trying to justify their opinions with sensationalist nonsense :V
---
I feel like there used to be a whole lot more getting datamined with any given patch... Has there been a noticable drop off in the amount of new stuff being pre-loaded over time or have they possibly been doing a better job at hiding/scrambling it?  
---
I frequently feel like they may be trying to use your efforts for free advertizement lol
---
I mean, scroll to mesmer: https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/81753/game-update-notes-july-16-2019
---
So.. Guardian? Joan is pretty much a magical paladin sort of figure
---
&gt;"Mirage: Mirages can only have one illusion active at a time."
---
Nobody will play mirage ever again as this will break its entire foundation.
---
A better tradeoff would be reduce all outgoing power damage by 10%? Maybe more? This will help focus it more on condition damage instead of F1 bursting
---
&gt;"Weaver: Lose access to offhand weapon skills."
---
No, combining elements is the entire premise of this profession. How about reduce base Vitality and Toughness by -50 or -100. It's already got enough evades and heals to counter this and makes it more of a glass cannon. High risk / high reward.
---
Good idea, but only if it gets more life steal to balance this out. Or perhaps have each cast reduce a small portion of maximum HP instead of a large threshold. But yes, good idea
---
Eh.. I say permanent merge with pet but retain the bonus stats and skills. Otherwise why bother?
---
That minimum is faaar too high! I say anything that isn't ranged should deal reduced damage instead.
---
&gt;Holosmith: Lose access to elite toolbelt skills. Lose acess to kits for 6 seconds when entering forge. Lose half of your health when you overheat. Lose access to toolbelt skills entirely when you overheat, until you lose all heat. Do less damage than core engineer.
---
Huge no to elite toolbelt skills. We already lose a large portion of HP while overheating and now we cannot access toolbelt skills after overheating.
---
I do feel the damage should be reduced by about 5%, it does have high burst in holo. But overall I think this elite is fine.
---
I guess this would be a good enough trade-off
---
Definitely no... How about slightly slower endurance regeneration instead? Or reduce base vitality?
---
&gt;Renegade: Can't join any parties, squads or guilds. Will automatically leave any party, squad and/or guild, when you become a Renegade. (Will also become hostile to most charr and human characters.)
---
Lol no. This class is very powerful anyways but it doesn't need to be tortured like this. I think just increasing the recharge on stance swapping would be better.
---
All of this would definitely need a lot of testing, but who knows, it's all just a thought anyways.
---
That feel when your Minstrel Thief teleports behind you and slaps you in the ass for 1k heal
---
 yeah, I can get behind that.
---
Im more hyped for this than I probably should be
---
Wow in decline??  With classic just around the corner?  Do you have any stats or sources because that sounds like a rather strange thing to say, also ff14 tied? After the release of one of the most popular expansions ever?
---
Are you sure?
---
Holo got nerfed, and while Scrapper is decent, it can only get you up so far in ranked. When you get close to Gold people know how to deal with Scrappers so that build is much less effective. You're better off learning Scourge or Reaper.
---
And mounts while we're at it! Might as well have the option to ban those skins too. I'm so tired of these threads.
---
The thing is that there's so much spaghetti code and crappy developer tools that they have a really really hard time doing anything. Like seriously, for bunch of WvW and PvP changes they have been claiming that they only need UI changes FOR FREAKING HALF A YEAR. Allliances should be possible in matter of months not years, i mean servers already exist just rename them and create some groups of players that you assign to an alliance. I really have no idea what it's taking them sooooooo freaking long except if they are not actually working on anytihng or spaghetti code, because i know, that thing is sometimes so bloooooody hard to resolve that it's often better to start over.
---
&gt; we have 3 games tied for second ESO/FFXIV/GW2,
---
I don't think there is any tie at all. GW2 is easily the last of those 3. FFXIV is easily the second.
---
&gt;The question is what GW2 is lacking to be put above ESO and FFXIV?
---
Content.
---
Right now, no changes. The other Grandmaster traits are pretty meh for a dedicated support build. Even without detection pulse, stealth gyro is still too useful to drop in favour of the added harassment of supply crate/mortar kit, though i do often use mortar when I'm not running in a guild squad.
---
that's the gen2 legendary - exordium
---
P.S. opposite to deadeye in the sense that deadeye is locked into a dps playstyle and I am looking for a class with more capabilities.
---
I want those perimeter turrets built yesterday!
---
I was thinking about buying an infusion and my wife was like "okay, so what does it do?"
---
And I'm like "uhh, nothing."
---
And she was like, "how about you make another legendary? At least that has stat swap."
---
She's not wrong.
---
Looking dumb is dumb, not impressive or jealousy-inducing.
---
Don't be sad, I learned this 6 years in.
---
Hello Signet of Illusions and Deceptive Evasion.
---
&gt;Just because you feel like your favourite game mode isn't doing well right now doesn't mean GW2 is dying. Give Anet a little more credit, stay patient and trust them a little more. Don't let yourself get trapped in the negativity spiral. We don't really know anything about Season 5 yet, and they probably have their reasons for keeping things vague for now. But looking at the facts, I'm convinced that Anet is on the right track, and that they will deliver tons of more content to us for many more years, and I'm absolutely sure that they're trying their best to make everyone, the casuals, the raiders, the PvPers and WvWers, happy.
---
This is the part of your post people are going to react to. With varying levels of justification, of course.
---
The problem is that this statement sounds like assurance of an individual's expectations. You want more raids? *Trust Anet and more will come!* You want better WvW balance? *Trust Anet and it will be fixed!* etc. etc. I get the feeling you meant it to be more like an assurance that the game is not going to fall over and die any time soon, but it definitely reads as a mismatch of expectations.
---
The reality is that Anet has proven over time that they are more than happy to stick to acceptable ranges of satisfaction. That is to say: They're not striving to be the best, to be perfect, to be the dominating MMO in the market. They have always stuck to a more casual design motif and very rarely dabbled in more hardcore stuff. They're not striving for mediocrity either. I think of Anet like that kid in high school who had a mix of C's, B's, and A's but never pushed hard to go straight all A+s. A comfortable above average performance with a few peaks and a few plummets.
---
I'm fine with all that. The game is comfy. It's easy enough to pick up and play with some friends and have a good enough time or just go full escapist and "solo" through large scale activities.
---
More like you zap stuff with electricity and they move and act faster
---
and Asura screams
---
[They don't publish player count anymore so this is one of the best ways left to measure it.](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?cat=8&amp;date=all&amp;q=wow%2Bworld%20of%20warcraft)
---
In addition to the Tybalts recap I'd suggest looking at the [wiki's major release list](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Release#Post_Heart_of_Thorns) and the (now 1 year old and outdated) [chart](http://www.nojamtoday.com/upload/guild_wars_2_content_and_feature_update_chart_290.png).
---
Although I look forward to it being implemented, it may not happen. 
---
Some folks gear out their toons to be obnoxious or attention grabbing, and this will prevent that. That spirit raven glider when gliding was introduced in WvW literally blocks most of the screen.
---
Oookay I read that but can I see a build ?
---
&gt;
---
Yes, the game is doing absolutely fine. No, it's not dying, quite the opposite.
---
When you say a game isn't dying, that is implying that it's not losing players, has nothing to do with the financials.
---
There are plenty of "dead" games that are doing fine financially because their cash shops rakes in loads of money.
---
Warrior (spellbreaker), mesmer (mirage), guardian (firebrand) all have pretty strong sustain, just in different ways
---
Spellbreaker is largely a PvP class, which sees occasional PvE usage, while mirage is one of the best condition based DPS classes, and firebrand is probably one of the most diverse PvE classes ATM with support, healing, and pure DPS builds available
---
I, for one, would be very pleased if they filled out some of the gaps in existing Skill sets, although practically speaking it's probably more effort than it's worth. I also suspect that it might result in some classes having more skills than others, although I would need to do some research to be sure of that. If it came down to a choice between new skills and new Elite Specs I'd definitely go for the latter, but I don't think it would be too impractical to add a new skill or two, maybe three, every major balance patch until the current roster is properly rounded out.
---
You can do that with any mesmer and not just chrono. But the follow up is awkward if you can't get clones up or a total waste if you just dodge the burst opening.
---
Guessing this is for build templates and you can name them, like on Warframe
---
Apart from item templates, it could also be something like editing the name of a fixed-stat item or the flavour text. I remember that in WoW it was possible to create "gifts" with customized messages. Could be it.
---
The presence of the quill icon 100% means we're going to (re)name something, the question is what. If those icons belong to the build template system, then it's obvious - naming of templates. But if it's part of that "Item Customize" thing, then I dunno, but my best guess would be naming your items so that build templates can distinguish between identical items. But I can't imagine them doing that, because historically they've been very stingy with letting players store strings, just look at rangers being unable to name any of their pets (apart from the 4 equipped ones) for multiple years after release.
---
Quite simply focus on its best asset.
---
Look at what GW2 does better than any other MMO.
---
Story? Nah, the story is garbage imo but even outside that bias, FF14 definitely has it best and imo ESO does too.
---
RPG systems? They aren't bad but ESO has better immersion, FF14 has a newcomer grind style and WoW is the old guard.
---
Open world? It's okay, but honestly too easy to be interesting and feels like filler to fluff the game when the other MMOs do it far better.
---
Gw2 destroys the other MMOs at one thing in particular though, the combat. ANET needs to focus and prop up the combat for marketing, making it the main selling point. I have tried the other MMOs and none of them come close to the amazing combat of GW2, especially in challenging PvE, PvP and WvW. These need to be the core focus of GW2's upcoming development or it won't grow.
---
It already had the casual market, they don't require much to placate and probably won't run out of content for a few years (taking them 4-5 years to make legendaries and such).
---
The real question is, why is ANET not promoting the combat, or the strongest part of the game for a focus on lackluster story? They could sell the game on the combat alone.
---
So about 11 weeks to unlock all 6 pieces of one type of armor using the triumphant chest, and then the mats to make the armor itself. And the exotic form the chest are consumed in the process?
---
Also, is the 11-week estimate based on some certain average time spent in wvw each week (and assumes participation stays up at or near t6 all the time)?
---
Pretty much, ESO especially has a pretty consistent content release schedule. There's almost too much to do.
---
I think the Living World model is great but is not consistent or advertised well enough. The annoying part is everything in LW is really engaging, but people who don't know about it can't enjoy it.
---
That's awesome, thanks for the info.
---
Trying beetle racing with no textures is fun. What other challenges should I try before re-downloading the game and repairing the files? hehe
---
I was trying to keep up using the wiki but last time i checked it hadn't been updated yet. Seems to be now so I will catch up now. Thanks.
---
We have a pretty good story up until Joko dies, all things considered, though the Kralk story was a bit dull for me personally. The whole "I was there" thing sounds cool but it's content that, as far as things are going now, I will never be able to experience. Regardless of how good it was, functionally it doesn't exist in the game anymore. I'd take a thousand season 3s or 4s over a single season 1 purely because it's content that I can replay, analyze, and really explore versus something I experience once and then it's gone. I'm perfectly fine with main story content being instanced if it means that future players won't just have to take my word on how amazing it is and can actually play it themselves.
---
I think your character should have all the spectacular animations, including old Phoenix, as well as louder, and more prominent sound effects.
---
Whereas when you see other player’s skills and spells, their effects and sounds should remain muted. This would make it much easier to see how you’re contributing.
---
Yes - you need to not be a free to play player, that is correct. Not entirely the same as locking templates behind a specific third expansion, however.
---
More than 4 content patches a year, real development of true group content.
---
Everything they are doing but more of it. At least in my opinion.
---
Yes, and my point was is that you're drawing false conclusions from the provided data. Anet doesn't make those numbers public, if the game was growing at a significant rate, Anet would be talking about it.
---
Like 3.6k hours that I have in GW2 is nothing for an 7 year old MMO. Hell I usually sink 200-500 hours into every Path of Exile league that I play. I think I sank double of that into CIV 5 when I was in uni... Guild Wars 2 really lacks the content to do in a group. And it is not getting better.
---
Why Warframe adds basically new class every major update? I even do not start about whole new gamemodes... Game have the same age. Why Path of Exile rework basic stuff like melee combat and adds new skills to the game aside core league mechanic every 3 month?
---
My point is that while awesome game in the core, Guild Wars 2 is just totally wasted potential. Instead of being this big MMO with awesome combat system, multiple PvP gamemodes, AWESOME mount system... it just shrank to fashion game for housewife with 2 hours of content every x months, where x&gt;4 in the past 2 years.
---
And trying other classes do not help. I usually go for the other main every 400-800h. I already played everything aside Mesmer. Just do not like purple.
---
And build templates, while maybe nice to have is just a tip of an iceberg. Cyrillic, Arabic and other language support missing from the game chat in 2019... This is an insult for anyone who do not use Latin letters for their mother tongue. Radial menu for 8 mounts is 3rd party addon? Separate keybinding is 3rd party addon? DX12 is 3rd party addon? Like at this point I think that Anet just do not do anything that require actual coding or tool development.
---
Open world challenging content could work though. I don't think you have to make a hardcore instanced content the main focus, you can just make open world more interesting.
---
Why did they move away from enemy mobs having actual builds like the players and comps? It made the combat so interesting, and you could make difficulty through interesting team builds rather than flat out damage or hp.
---
Like imagine a group of War Forged with a Firebrand support and a Supplementary Deadeye positioned to provide ranged air cover, and you need to pick a tactic in order to ruin their group synergy. Like so many cool possibilities man!
---
This for sure! Snap to target should be more customizable. You should be able to set this for specific skills, or specific characters. It sucks to have to always search through the menu between PvP and pve content..
---
All of this + doing a better job at listening to the community.  We've repeated ourselves dozens of times to the point of people getting banned on the forums.  How much clearer can we be?  People were literally offering to pay for build templates.  I hope with their canned projects, we see actual movement from the company again that isn't in the form of another PvE map.
---
So I looked around on the wiki for a bit (I'm a bit limited at work), but I wasn't able to find an answer: Why 3 weapons and a stone rather than just 4 weapons?
---
Really good points.
---
I also don't think much of this would be against their philosophy, I'd actually say most of them should be direct conclusions of them!
---
They only added new skills by replacing skills. That's a step back in my opinion.
---
At various points in PvP's life, traps were a thing in PvP. And now they're not anymore.
---
Living story is fine if it was only one aspect of what was developed, but it's the only one.. 
---
Have to agree with combat comments. For me GW2 has the best MMO combat and by far.
---
Well fuck them, have to get everything through other sources.
---
Changing your build will require some new currency you can only buy on the gem store and will translate to roughly 10g per build change.
---
If you buy the core game without an expansion, you don't get masteries: for instance, if you bought the game pre-HoT you do not have access to masteries.
---
Nice explanation. I do play as a team so currently I play scourge. the reason i wanna play scrapper is to play different champs.
---
Seriously????!?!?!? They are only doing open world pve... That's the issue.
---
Yeah. Well to be completely honest. I despise the trade-offs. They're ruining my gameplay experience on all of my favorite professions. The biggest one now is Chrono being unable to self shatter. I remember having a trait for that and using it. Now it can't at all. Period.
---
Nearly 10k hours on my chrono and I don't see it viable in anything besides fractals or raids now.
---
I am glad thief was changed, though at this rate I've already began looking for a new MMO to play.
---
So all these hypothetical changes won't apply to me :)
---
I play games where I'd be legitimately scared this would be the case...
---
how about finishing skill types 
---
like guardian spirit weapons still missing a heal and a elite ...
---
It only starts to shine in those 2 modes...
---
Then you probably want guardian or mesmer.
---
Rev is okay too.
---
Warrior is mostly just DPS though.
---
Guardian.  See this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lADmx3SVU08&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
i wonder why washed down braindead afk tourist mode LFR should be the best thing ever happend to instanced group content where you are supposed to work together in a team to solve the puzzle or overcome something hard.  
---
at the start of guild wars 2 i was, like everyone else, a player with no idea at all, had toughness gear with condition on my sword sword warrior while we had a guardian healer and other people which had no idea at all what to do and guess what...we did every single dungeon within the first month. shit where people cried its too hard and whatnot.  
---
if you game and you are curious about teamcontent, you evolve anyway through experience you get and from the input and ideas of others. going against that, going against "meta" or the "good strat" is something which is beyond help.  
---
you wouldn't try to run up a escalator which runs down in reallife regularly because fuck those mainstream people using it the right way. you wouldn't use a fork to cut your meal.  
---
and in instanced team content it is the same. you use the right tools given to you, be it experience you make yourself or through others.  
---
washed down content so everyone can be a special little snowflake being cathered through something is the biggest shit in videogame history.  
---
if you wanna be brain afk, go and play a single player game and cheat. if you wanna be brain afk, go and watch tv. if you want to be brain afk, go and gather in the openworld. just stay the fuck out of teamcontent and stop crying over your incompetence to use more then 2 braincells.  
---
there are a shitton of people out there which play the game after work for fun and they do not bother anyone at all, they do not give a shit about anything and you know whats good about them...they simply say: i am not the audience this content is made, good for the people which can play this.
---
I don't know about ESO as I haven't given it much attention.
---
But FFXIV is ahead of GW2. They have subscription and they can deliver content. Members of SC are moving towards FFXIV. My raiding guild has left the game because FFXIV has content. Even on MMORPG.com FFXIV went ahead of GW2 at score.
---
They simply have content. And the new expansion just hit.
---
How long have you been playing the game?
---
I've been saying "This game has so much potential" since about a year after launch. 
---
I wish I had your enthusiasm, but you're dead on regarding my depression regarding the state of the game. I don't think Anet is going to change this--especially since PoF was such a snoozefest and it sold SO well.
---
Right?  I feel like all the effects, auras, infusions etc are all just a slushy mess atm.
---
Ill have chain attacks on all my magical missile AAs please, thanks.
---
I see.
---
Looks like an opportunity to start a world completion with a new character in Twitch
---
Exactly that, and a game should never need admin access to run.
---
Sometimes you get the currency... sometimes bloodstone dust... surprise!
---
That's not as simple as it sounds. While FF14, ESO, and WoW have improved their engines over the years, those companies are vastly larger than Arena Net and probably have devs dedicated only to the engine. My guess is that ArenaNet has devs sharing time between any engine with they're doing and general GW2 dev. That it they ARE working on engine changes and just aren't ready to share them.
---
Ah, okay. That makes sense, Thanks!
---
Part of the problem is part of the playerbase aswel. As long as people come and call things like "World Boss Rush" CONTENT when it's just a shitty box added to some world bosses there is no hope.
---
I've looked on both the forums and reddit and every time I see "WHOO, Festival of the Four Winds is coming. It's my favorite festival. Can't wait!" the devs won't probably move a finger if people are satisfied with this shit.
---
So because it would be need to done differently, there is no way that they would tie something as core as build templates to the purchase of an expansion, when they have shown us that that they are willing to tie something as core as AoE loot to the purchase of an expansion?
---
No, I’m saying that if you want to be a special snowflake that doesn’t want to swap weapons during combat, you can play ele, engineer, hammer guard, staff DD, or axe/axe berserker. Weapon swap makes combat more interesting and dynamic and there are still plenty of ways you can enjoy not swapping while others enjoy it.
---
It did 5 years ago. GW2's combat was like an uncut diamond on the market. But they've shoveled so much shit on top that nothing's shining anymore. Ask any high-end PvP or WvW player if they enjoy playing the game and you'll probably get a firm "no".
---
Most veterans only stick around because they are addicted to what this game once was.
---
Or in GW1.
---
Build templates first I hope!  I assume the other would be added to preview.
---
they planned for that, but the engi missed and hit himself
---
&gt; The question is what GW2 is lacking to be put above ESO and FFXIV?
---
There doesn't need to be an "above" and "below". Why can't they just be different games, catering to slightly different kinds of people?
---
Yeah, from an open field standpoint its not useful, but for thieves who tend to pick off from enemy tails or are joining in on SMC defense they can make very good use of the skill since there's only so many ways an enemy zerg can get out, like placing one on top of the stairs on a wall as most people would head for the nearest exit when the zerg collapses and retreats.
---
Metabattle is probably your current best resource. I would wait for a little bit to see where the meta goes, since thief did get some pretty interesting changes yesterday (shadow arts traits changes and preparations skills), which might see a use in PvP
---
I love the soundtrack. Super nostalgia kicking in.
---
I am new to the game and visibility of mechanics mainly due to too many effects is my biggest negative about the game so far. 
---
I am already dying to things because I am new and might not properly react to things, but having to react to things you can't say is just frustrating. I play with lowest character model quality so everyone gets the same default outfit, but it feels like a useless setting considering that I still see auras, backpacks and legendary weapons.
---
Eh, or just grind it out. There's very few of these currencies that feel like I can't obtain them with a little dedication.
---
Problem is MMO's are not so profitable as they were in the past so GW3 might have a huge question mark above it. NCSoft bought the [guildwars3.com](http://guildwars3.com) domain back in 2004 or 2005 if I remember correctly having it just in any case.
---
For me personally it needs massive performance improvements. The game runs like shit on high end hardware. Even with d912pxy. I get headaches from GW2.
---
Fucking devastation lmao
---
Mine has been like this for about a year now. Takes a LONG-ass time to load anything in. Map itself sometimes randomly takes 3+ minutes to get out of the loading screen.
---
Compilation of a one-button-spec. How do you even enjoy playing this? You are literally just spamming f1 and everything around gets hit by 20k. Even watching this lowers your iq
---
"This time it's personal, kid ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡\~)"
---
I have mixed feelings about the egg auras. On the one hand eggs, on the other hand clean and simple design.
---
Sorry but that's how the free markets work.
---
A lot of skill types are. Note even with these new thief preparations, we didn't get a preparation heal, elite, or H.
---
RIP. There's no hope of ANet providing the same functionality, because displaying decimal places is soooo user-unfrieeeendly.
---
ANY sane argument will get downvoted here.  This channel is about hype and gripes with some news.
---
I've never played deeply with the mesmer
---
I wanted to start using it in raids to give him a purpose
---
I wasn't clear. The reason that they're holosmith fanatics is because of how it's rotation was safe, simple and flexible it is by comparison to other dps specs.
---
Don't forget the term ff14. Yeah though, Shadowbringers is absolutely fantastic and well worth the hype it's getting.
---
Yeah like i said i play mesmer as a main GvGer... If anyone doesn't have hope or faith it's me.
---
You need expansion for masteries, I had an expansionless paid account for a while and I needed to buy them to unlock core tyria masteries
---
Heh not bad, you made me blush 10%
---
Same, my guild isn't active enough for me to have even conceived the idea of asking someone something.
---
Not really “cherry picking,” closer to cynicism. But even then, it’s not unwarranted or crude; I think it’s just being candid and realistic.
---
At the end of the day, ANet is a company that exists to make a quality product that’s profitable. They’re not our friend whose existence is for the sole purpose of making us happy and keeping us entertained. Granted, those two purposes can, and often do, overlap. 
---
Now, I have no idea how they actually do their decision making. But let’s pretend they ask themselves at least two questions:
---
1.	Will this make the players happy?
---
2.	Will this be worth the time and the effort spent (i.e. what would be the return on investment)?
---
Now, I’m sure ANet would love nothing more than to be able to always answer “yes” to *both* of those questions whenever possible. **However**, if they could only satisfy one of those questions, which do you think they’d rather answer “yes” to?
---
Sounds great, also sounds like it would bug out one day and someone will take a free legendary armor home, but if bugs don't happen it's an amazing idea
---
Which build do you recommend?
---
Thanks. I'll look it up :)
---
Usually the meta builds are fine in open world.
---
Only things I usually change for open world is drop a utility for something more survival oriented like arcane shield.  The elite that lets you spawn elementals can be handy as well.  Earth elemental can be a great tank solo, and fire is good for more dps, air can help a bit against break bars.
---
Only other thing is try different weapon sets or alternatively switch in a couple pieces of marauders gear.  Depending your build it just helps to learn what skills will benefit your survivability better.  In open world at least I'd disregard rotations, since surviving is usually key here.
---
i wont; 2 builds per char is pathetic, and expanding that on a per char basis for gems would be expensive regardless of the individual cost
---
I mean it's not like the specs where you don't spam 1 button are challenging.
---
Oh look I'm a scourge -rollsfaceonkeyboard- everyones dead, nice.
---
Yw c:
---
GW3 with a new engine
---
This is silly. I am not hiding anything, I quite clearly said "non weaver staff". There were zero viable staff Condi builds before weaver...but then again, there were zero viable ele Condi builds before weaver. They've buffed Condi skills since then so it's not wholly reliant on weaver, but still, weaver is what makes Condi ele mostly viable. Core and tempest staff have nothing to do with conditions.
---
This is like saying that ranger axe is a support weapon, because druids use it to power up celestial avatar through multihits. Just, no, that's silly, you cant reclassify what a weapon fundamentally does as its baseline just because an elite spec creates a new way to use it.
---
That’s a common mistake, I’d say. 
---
Just because something is good for instanced content doesn’t mean it is good for open world. Raid/Fractal builds are mostly optimal to one specific aspect, may it be dps, healing or tanking. These builds ‘assume’ that you have all the boons + support needed from other players. This is not always the case in open world, specially for solo scenarios. 
---
Id suggest looking at stat sets like Marauder’s or Valkyries’ that have some Vitality built into them. Also traits that provide you with ur own Might, Fury, Prot, etc.. are really useful for open world. I don’t know what type or Ele, weapons and specs, you are planning on running but you do have a lot of pretty fun options, IMO,  for open world builds. Overall you should play around with ur traits and maybe not run Zerker gear if you think u might be dying too much.
---
Ty
---
MMO genre as a whole is dead... why would any publisher so stupid to invest in something new or existing in the MMO market right now, it just doesn't make sense money wise, when Mobile gaming (curse) exist.
---
China mobile gaming is already much bigger alone, then the pc and console gaming industry worldwide combined.
---
You can have the most bear bone game with close to no development cost, while pushing predatory abusive monetisation to the max and the mass are happily shoving them way more money to them then any other game.
---
in short: "like mesmer" :P
---
Some good points in this thread. Some that have almost zero effect for casual players (easily majority of gw2 players).
---
There is one thing, among many. Im just gonna say it, no matter how unpopular it is.
---
* Automated LFG system.
---
For super casual game like gw2 to not have this is mind-boggling. Specially after whole megaserver thing. Im talking about Tier 1-3 fractals and maybe some "easier" raids too.
---
You would still need to make LFG for T4s and normal/cm raids.
---
It would add replayablity a lot for casuals. Open up more doors outside just few open world maps. Now lot of them just see raids and fractals as "too hardcore" and they are "too scared" because they would get shit on.
---
It works on FF14, it works on WoW (and ESO?)
---
And before someone asks "but how would roles work! theres so many!". Yeah, no there isnt. The "death of holy trinity" isnt no longer there. You could easily add druid/fb/tempest/scrapper(?) as support/healer and maybe add tank spec for chrono and so forth.
---
Hell, you could even make people pick few forced specs and utilities to make it really fool-proof (like "pvp quick templates"). Its T1-3 we talking about not T4 CM.
---
Its really unpopular opinion on MMO-space tho. Something about making it less social. But if you are gonna complain gw2 is "singleplayer with npcs that are other players" then this shouldnt be issue ;)
---
It's not that simple. For reaper it's missing a lot of skills in that list.
---
I know, right? Most fights are not about who hits the right abilities/rotation. It's about timing as a group, positioning, and situational awareness.
---
It's not that simple. For reaper that wiki link is missing a lot of skills in that list that do break bar.
---
Keep Character Model Limit at Medium or higher for raids though, if it culls a player any mechanics telegraphs attached to their character also vanish.
---
I was just thinking of this today!
---
I was having legitimate difficulty doing fractals last night with a Norn with legendary trinkets/backpack/twilight/you name it. He looked like someone zip-tied the Vegas strip to a supernova.
---
I get you're proud of all that stuff, and I'm happy for you (and I'ma let you finish), but I play zerker thief, I NEED to see the boss animations.
---
I've been sitting for the last 5 minutes confused wondering why people want to limit player "Asuras", then suddenly realized I read it wrong.
---
What is "aided by" in business?
---
Bonus points if the builtslots are character bound, not account bound...
---
&gt; Compared to GW2, no other MMO even deserves to be called massively multiplayer. 
---
EVE Online has battles at times with thousands of players at once, GW2 does not come close to that in terms of being "massively multiplayer".
---
Then beyond that GW2 is not alone in big PvE events, Rift for example did it years before GW2 got similar stuff with the HoT zone events.
---
I can afford infusions, even dropped one once, but I think they look hideous.  You can't even see your outfit really with most of them, especially stacked. The reason they're expensive is the rarity and there are people that like them for whatever reason and are willing to pay for that rarity.  I'm not sure money has anything to do with the fact so many people are against infusions.   The real question is, why would anyone care if others could turn it off on their own screen?
---
I don't mind in cities, it's mostly in challenging raids/high level fractals where I'm trying to read boss animations and can't because there's too much noise.
---
I'm expecting it to drop close to WoW Classic launch.
---
I run d/wh Tempest with Cele stats, because if you want to be a Jack-of-all-trades go all in. It's not crazy optimal but it's fun, especially once you get a rotation you like down. Mix in some aurashare and you've got a party.
---
Nearly every piece of end game content is balanced so that you would rather pay money to not play the game, rather than play it.  For example, I raid a lot, I have all the raid stuff needed to get the new legendary ring.  I am not planning to get it because I would have to grind a ton of T6 mats, and 250 funerary incense.  Its not fun.  I don't have a problem with grind.  I could happily train at dhuum cm for hours and hours and hours (and I have).  But grinding the same boring meta train every day just to get those 250 amalgamated gemstones to get the main rewards from raids?  I would rather pay to avoid doing that, rather than actually do it.  I think that's just the nature of pay to win micro transaction based games.  
---
To answer your question, what is gw2 lacking?  A subscription.  A subscription fundamentally changes the mindset of mmo developers.  Rather than, 'pay to avoid playing' a subscription model becomes 'pay to keep playing'.
---
I just run berserker gear with the meta sword raid build. It's easy enough to survive on anything in open world, and pretty much every build can do everything.
---
Made a poll on gw2 forums
---
Also wahorn 5 in Earth is a large blind field.
---
I'd use my Juggernaut more if I had the option to not look like a tinfoil man
---
&gt; Living World Season 5 is anticipated in Quarter 3 of 2019.
---
Source: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_5
---
Since War Eternal (LWS4E5) was released on May 14th, and we follow the super-ideal release schedule of "every 3. months", we won't get anything before mid August. However, as LWS5 episodes will probably act as small mini-expansions (eg, elite specs are rumoured) then I wouldn't expect anything until late September (technically still Q3) or early October.
---
Let's give ANet the time they need to create world class content.
---
I wish the game were balanced around raiding, maybe we'd finally have some good balance then.
---
&gt;i wonder why washed down braindead afk tourist mode LFR should be the best thing ever happend to instanced group content where you are supposed to work together in a team to solve the puzzle or overcome something hard.

&gt;...and guess what, if anet can deliver only 1 fractal and 1 raid per year, your shit with snowflake, casual, medium-raw mode would take even more devtime away to develop something. exactly what we do not want.
---
More people means more resources from the devs, means more content. I'm not going to bother to explain to you that washed down braindead afk tourists are people, too, that ship has sailed long ago with you. But right now you're cutting off your own nose to spite your face. If you'd rather have nothing instead of additional difficulties and more content, just so that filthy casuals don't besmirch your hallowed gamemode with their disgusting presence, so be it. Strangle raids to death with your toxicity and exclusivity, go ahead.
---
&gt; &gt; we must nerf every farming spot available that doesn't drain your soul, we'd rather you work than play our game.
---
Gotta drive up those gem prices somehow so poor whales got "incentive" to keep buying them to convert to gold.
---
EVE's battles are PvP, not PvE...
---
And yes, other games *have* big open world PvE events, but they are far fewer in number, variety, and depth. Nowhere even close to GW2.
---
Intuitive Matchmaking.  I've been on and off with GW2 but every time I launch it right now it's only for the story content.  While I have no doubt there there are players welcoming to players that haven't been playing endgame content since day one, I still remember the days when LFG was full of "15k AP or kick".  Hell, the few public raid runs I've attempted I've been instantly kicked for not having had a raid clear before.  Even if it HAS gotten better, it's just so much easier for me to close the game, boot up FFXIV, and queue up with the duty finder, rather than bother worrying if my time is going to be wasted hoping I can find something in LFG.    
---
As far as content goes, GW2 feels like each piece of story content is on it's own island, and we don't see the truly immense world scale within the story.  The majority of content drops we've gotten, regardless of how many or few there are, have basically only been a new open world area along with some tiny tidbit of story that, for the most part, only really exists to tell us why we're in the new area.  Admittedly, the last two LS episodes have done a really good job of being more than just "go here, do this thing" which I think is a step in the right direction, but I'd like to see more of that.
---
If we compare that to FFXIV (I don't have any direct ESO experience so most of my comment will compare the two), the new expansion gives us a new dungeon every roughly 2 levels, and they just FEEL meaty.  The mechanics are (mostly) solid, and they're fun to do.  Add on top of that the trials, and how the expansion ties into the story, and all the other tidbits that go along with it, and right now FFXIV, even if I'm just levelling alt jobs, feels less grindy than anything I've been doing in endgame GW2.
---
Also, side note about the duty finder that I thought of while writing this: Specific stuff in the duty finder is locked behind item level.  Sort of impossible with the way GW2 does gear, so a system that locks high-tier content behind specific stat numbers might work (tanks need a minimum toughness, healers need minimum Healing Power, dps needs a minimum power+precision or condi, etc)
---
Male Sylvari. 100%.
---
I'd kill to be able to turn their effect off. Sigh.
---
not to be tHAT guy but i see that hair and face on every male asura it's so off-putting  😂 the shaders however, do make it look significantly better than vanilla.
---
people might say gem store skins are "low-effort" but that makes 0 sense to me seeing as you have to have an eye to match skins together. besides the face + hair combo your character looks amazing &amp; i personally love asura fashion cause it's some of the hardest to pull off. with them you need an even keener attention to detail and I take extra time to appreciate the dedication.
---
(my personal choice for hair would've been one of the braided locs they have- i think it would look great on your character, but great job nonetheless!)
---
&gt; According to MMOpopulations. (which really is the only source of this kind of information, the caveat being it’s not official information) 
---
It is also completely wrong, for example an ESO devs have occasionally stated in interview the active monthly population of the game which if I remember correctly was about 2.5 million (Though unlike GW2 that is across PC/PS/Xbox)
---
Yeah.  Would be nice if ANet gave us the option to turn them on or off, not only for others but our own as well.  Yes, I get that the effect might be why some make them, but for others it’s the versatility.
---
They will add them later, traits revolving around them too
---
EA isn't top tier anymore, some of their owned companies (like the ones that made titanfall and apex) are good. But pure ea is the same shit over and over again like fifa and star wars. And even then the biggest chunk of money in those games comes from people who literally can't be bothered to waste time playing unfun stuff in the game and just buy lootboxes or direct purchases to speed it up.
---
seriously, profit DOES NOT equal the tier/quality of a game, isn't there some asian mobile game that made more money that LoL in 2016? Must've been a top tier game /s
---
*inhales his tea*
---
Goddamn. Put a warning on actually hilarious posts!
---
I found a really nice build (marauders, mainly) for solo pve.  It was on Metabattle.
---
I’m on phone so not 100% sure but think it was this one:
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Weaver_-_Open_World_Survival
---
Yeah, I remember when people realized vuln was a thing and engi actually got use. 
---
Regardless, I don't think that means dungeons as a whole were a bad concept, they just need to be designed with the new scope of community knowledge in mind.
---
Waaaait there's an easy weaver build? Like, "just" easy, not weaver-easy? Wtf.
---
Frankly, I don't think it's possible for GW2 to outpace the likes of FFXIV - it just doesn't have the sheer resources that a subscription-based game has to throw at new content and features. That said, I also don't think it needs to; Guild Wars as a franchise has built itself on being the MMO that others (specifically WoW) aren't, and I see no reason to stop now. In fact, doing so would probably do the game more harm than good.
---
With that in mind, I do think there's a lot ANet could do to close the gap.
---
1. **Overhaul the engine.** It is simply embarrassing that, in 2019, a *Massively Multiplayer* Online game starts to chug when there are more than 20 players on-screen at once. Things like upgrading from DX9 would be good as well, but clearing that one major bottleneck would be of enormous benefit to the game.
---
2. **Refine what they already have.** There is a lot of content in the early game that could use some polish, particularly in the area of AoE markers. GW2 has several different types of these, which often seem to be used almost randomly, and greater standardisation would make large-scale combat much clearer for players of all skill levels. Related to this is the possibility of adding some sort of casting bar for non-AoE skills - as it stands, there are many cases where the only way to learn the timing for dodging an attack is to get hit (and often killed) by it a few times, which is a major shortcoming in a game that puts so much emphasis on evasion and mobility in combat.
---
3. **Use existing easy content to make new hard content.** GW2 contains an enormous amount of interesting environments and enemies, both instanced and open-world, yet only a tiny proportion of it has an alternative higher-difficulty mode, and that is generally tied to a non-repeatable achievement which makes accessing it difficult. Story bosses, World Bosses, meta-events, dungeons - all this and more could be modified for more challenging 5 or 10-man instances, yet it largely goes unused. In particular, almost every time I fight a World Boss I think, "man, it would be fun if I could do a 10-man instanced version of this, even without too much added difficulty or new mechanics," and the fact that there aren't harder versions of the major story bosses tuned for larger groups (with the exception of Mordremoth, which is again tied to an achievement and, if I'm not mistaken, still all kinds of buggy nearly four years after release) seems like a massive oversight. Give us our version of Extreme Trials and Hard Dungeons from FFXIV, darn it! I want to beat my head in trying to beat Balthazar EX!
---
4. **Invest in the community.** This means, frankly, spending money on things that aren't likely to have much or any financial return, but will result in large amounts of goodwill and good press. Things like LWS1, or the later half of the SAB, or other popular projects that have gathered dust because there just isn't a way to make them profitable. Take that financial hit to earn the trust and respect of the players, and it will very likely pay off in the long run.
---
5. **Rethink the core mechanics of the game.** GW2 is, on a very fundamental level, designed to not require dedicated tanks or healers. While I heartily approve of this in principle, the fact that they go so far in this direction that the game *cannot* have tanks or healers in the conventional sense has probably done more harm than good in the long run, particularly with the introduction of Raids. The very highest levels of the game need things like a proper aggro system, a more coherent way of managing non-Boon buffs and debuffs to avoid the "banner slave" situation, a clear idea of what roles should exist in a high-level party and how a given class or spec falls into them, and reasons for players to actually use defensive stat sets. That said, the devs need to be careful to do all this without disrupting the freedom and flexibility that make the game what it is, and to do it without the changes bleeding in to lower levels of play. I don't think this is an impossible task, but it would certainly be a challenging one.
---
6. **Be honest with themselves, and us.** Ever since the beginning of LWS3 ANet has made it clear that they intend to release a new Living World episode every 2-3 months, however they have also consistently missed that target for almost the entirety of S4, and while they still have the potential to make it work for S5 they've been silent so far and time is running out. If they need to change that target in order to meet their standards of quality and scope for an episode, *that's OK*, but they need to acknowledge that change to themselves and communicate it to the community, openly and clearly. They would also do well to communicate more regularly on what they're working on and how they plan to move forward; I fully appreciate that they don't want to repeat the massive overhype of HoT, but an update on what's going on every few months would go a long way towards making people more confident in the future of the game, and it wouldn't hurt to tease new episodes at least a bit farther in advance.
---
7. **Adjust the ratio of how rewards are distributed.** As it stands, the clear majority of the new cosmetic content added to the game goes straight to the cash shop, and while that's entirely understandable for a game that relies on said cash shop for most of its income and is (with rare exceptions) one of the most pro-consumer in its monetisation on the market, a bit of an adjustment would probably go a long way. In particular, the fact that there are essentially no Mount or Glider skins available via PvE is a sore issue, and even a small concession would make a lot of people very happy. Even something simple like a version of the default skin with one or two extra dye channels, or a mount with a bit of armor to make it look more adventurous, or a different saddle, would likely be enough for a lot of people, and while it would likely cut into cosmetic sales a little bit we again come to investing in the community - making a bit less money to make the game more player-friendly would probably be a good idea in the long run. There's also some room for improvement in the area of reward exclusivity, particularly with Raids. The fact that some of the rarest rewards can be bought with gold (and thus, indirectly, Gems) on the trading post severely undermines their value, and restricting them could very well encourage some players to get into Raiding for them, making said restriction doubly beneficial.
---
That's all I can think of for the moment, but there's probably more. GW2 is, for all its problems, in a very good position right now, and I suspect that before the year is out we're going to get a lot of new features and content that will make people very happy indeed. Still, it's always worthwhile to be self-aware, so hopefully ANet will be able to take some of these ideas to heart (and NCSoft will be willing to tolerate the reduced profit that many of them would likely entail).
---
If you have lots of characters you can park them in the [Tomb of Primeval Kings](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tomb_of_the_Primeval_Kings) to open the 6 chests there. The amount of gold went down pretty hard since the unidentified gear change but it's still around 3-4g for me in about 6 minutes (with 8-10 chars).
---
It's decent money that you can do whenever you want at your own time but can only be done once per day and depends on having several chars.
---
Oh wow, a direct challenge towards all the jaded haters that couldn't enjoy the game even if their life depended on it?
---
Bold. Rest in piece.
---
Hey, that's me!
---
&gt; EVE's battles are PvP, not PvE...
---
And you claimed "Compared to GW2, no other MMO even deserves to be called massively multiplayer."...
---
&gt; Nowhere even close to GW2.
---
Rose tinted spectacles...
---
I honestly thought it was a nice sarcasm while I was reading.
---
I am now using [this build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vFAQFAWhMMouhlNwkB0RMIAYylUKgeCqCRAwBA-jBCBABnpE0QdAFt/AAXAgKeAAlpMBLlWVq+TAAEgP+xAARBEYA-e) with some of the new traits. Everything is as marked in this build, and the three missing traits are:
---
* Fire: Power Overwhelming, +300 Power in Fire Attunement while you have at least 10 Might.
---
* Air: Raging Storm, critical strikes grant Fury, and Fury grants +180 Ferocity.
---
* Water: Flow Like Water, deal 10% more damage while your health is above 75%, and blocking or dodging an attack heals you a little.
---
This is a very old staff elementalist build that's been brought back into the light - for open world, at least. Its damage rotation is simple, you merely stay in Fire Attunement, cast Lava Font and Meteor Shower on cooldown, and autoattack the rest of the time, sprinkled with the occasional activation of Arcane Blast.
---
The outgoing damage is plenty high enough when alone against random trash and Veterans; and Persisting Flames grants a much stronger and longer-lasting Lava Font that guarantees a rally from downed state.
---
Against bosses with large hitboxes, 25 Vulnerability, and permanent Burning uptime (so like every boss at every meta event ever), it does approximately 10.8k DPS while standing at 1200 range, and with only its own buffs. This is on par with, as of this patch: a chronomancer camping greatsword; a soulbeast camping longbow; and a rifle deadeye standing up the whole time.
---
It is higher than the new baseline ranged DPS build, the hammer herald no legend swap (turn on Fury and Swiftness facets, 211112111121111 repeat), which is a 1-button rotation that hits about 8.4k world boss DPS. This is baseline because no other build could possibly be easier while still having so many desirable open world tools available, so anything lower DPS than that isn't worth considering.
---
I tested other combinations of Fire traits. Using Force sigil instead of Strength, combined with Pyromancer's Puissance to maintain at least 10 Might for Power Overwhelming, results in slightly lower DPS. Likewise, keeping Persisting Flames and Force sigil, and using Burning Rage for bonus condition damage to boost your Burning output, is also slightly less DPS. The combination of Persisting Flames and Power Overwhelming is important to this build, so the 10 Might needs to come from somewhere else. Pack runes help a bit with that, especially when first beginning combat, so opening with a Meteor Shower is usually very effective.
---
I wish they were spicing somewhere but the place it's already so spicy as to be barely palatable.
---
Still GW2 has much better underwater combat. So really the released an underwater boss but the combat sucks it ain't worth it.
---
I'd take an underwater raid before having no w8. The first boss should be quite easy but then two and three (and four? :smile:) should scale be a looot harder.
---
Ahh I’d love this. And other things (mounts, gliders, novelties, dyes, finishers, mail carriers... ANYTHING that can be unlocked like that) to be added to the wardrobe. Looking at it in the hero panel just isn’t the same. I want to be able to scroll through all those things and look at my stuff like that, it’s really so satisfying. I’ve unlocked so many skins and minis I don’t care about just to get it all and fill out the wardrobe. I’d spend more money on those other things if they were there
---
[Tomb of primeval kings](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tomb_of_the_Primeval_Kings) is decent. There are 6 chests you can open per character per day. Takes less than a minute per char and is somewhere around 40s or so per character for all chests.
---
It used to be a lot more before the unidentified gear change came out but I haven't found anything that's really better.
---
 [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Open\_World/Soloing](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Open_World/Soloing) 
---
Pretty good builds for Open World on here.
---
But didn’t they remove skills too? So there aren’t more skills on one class than all the others. So we lost as much content as we gained
---
looks.
---
CC used to not be important, it wasn't until around the time that HoT came out that break bars became a thing. It used to be that you can push or pull any enemies including champion or legendary bosses. So the base game UI never got updated.
---
I don't think ANet is delusional enough to think they will be competing with WoW on raids.
---
Yeah, there's a delay while the phantasm activates and then turns into a clone. Even longer if you have Chronophantasma. Phantasmal Warden in particular takes forever. 
---
That said, for the standard power boon chrono, the raid rotation really hasn't changed at all. The primary loss is the inability to use Distortion as an emergency button, and the fact that you have to retrain your f5 muscle memory to f4 (both of which are significantly annoying but not class-destroying).
---
I am so sorry. Hopefully we'll find somewhere better.
---
Sword Weaver is very hard on open world PvE because you're almost one-shot by bosses and die almost instantly to a couple Veterans when hit. It's basically a glass cannon. I've used it for a while and in most cases I either killed vets quickly enough so they barely get an attack out, or I'd be downed and rally by killing them downed.
---
If you're against 1-2 vets and a few common mobs you're almost certainly going to be downed. With luck you can rally and finish the job.
---
I'm using a Fresh Air + Arcane Tempest build to run Open World using Scepter and Warhorn. You basically tag/kill stuff with Overload Air and skills 4 + 5 from Warhorn, spamming 2 whenever you can because it has no cast time. After you finish Overload Air, you leave a Thunderstorm AoE that crits mobs, so your strategy is to swap to whatever attunement you need right after you finish Overload Air, throw 1 or 2 skills out as needed, then you quickly swap back to Air again so in 6 seconds you can Overload Air again. Go to Fire for more damage and to tag other mobs, Water for healing and Earth for projectile reflect.
---
In open world PvE, survivability is your best bet, so always go for survivability traits first and then mobility.
---
I'm running 2-3-1 on Arcane and 1-3-1 on Tempest. Choose Air as you wish, with the only restriction of picking Fresh Air to reset your Air attunement and use Overload Air every 6-8 seconds
---
For utilities, I'm running full mobility: Lightning Flash, Mist form and Arcane Shield
---
Been begging for this for long now but got zero response about it. Consider how many upvotes it gets every time it comes up it is something that many want and need.
---
Quitting the game and not spending money on it are two different things. I will still enjoy the game for what it is but damn it's a shame what they did to their game world's aesthetics.
---
No? Lol
---
My first thought was an option for putting legendary effects and other effects/auras on different weapons/armor. There's plenty of regular weapons that I'd love to combine with legendary effects like astralaria and bifrost.
---
Ballsy move consdering WoW has zero underwater QoL for combat.
---
I enjoy guardian because of aegis. It was a godsend when I was learning the game. I started playing firebrand and enjoyed the aoe heal and aoe damage and boon provide. I prefer dragonhunter now because I can pull and shred mobs quite easily, it's just fun to me.
---
yeah, at least foods..
---
Put the Mirage symbol over the noose and it's more accurate.
---
What is it missing?
---
I'd kill for having full sets of skills for all core professions.
---
or at least just give my warrior an elite shout and i'll stop complaining about this.
---
There's a reason that I've never said that GW2 was "dying".  I don't believe that it's dying.  It has a lot of systems that suffer from extreme neglect and abandonment as ArenaNet moves from one hot monthly flavor to another.  I believe that it's ostracizing its veteran playerbase.  You act like people want to be angry, frustrated or irrationally insensitive.  It's exhausting - no one wants to feel that the game is stale, bland or discouraging player interaction yet until proven otherwise?  
---
/u/Lovefully-Kun brought up in another thread; 
---
[&gt; Even now I'm not fully convinced ANet has abandoned completely these side projects they were working and are focusing on GW2. Pre-layoffs period and post-layoffs till present day seems the very same thing to me.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ceh6s5/what_does_gw2anet_needs_to_take_the_lead_on_the/eu2sue4/)
---
I'm inclined to agree with this, and it genuinely scares me.  
---
MMO's are game's that are based on creating habits in their players.  Breaking those habits -- ignoring my daily and weekly rituals is a big part of moving on from the game.  I haven't been gaming very much lately to tell you all the truth.  **I genuinely miss the "experience" of playing GW2, but I don't find playing GW2 fun because it isn't fresh or exciting anymore.**  
---
I haven't written very much about endgame PvE or raiding.  When I talk about wanting a new experience-- my own personal desires for GW2; I want an exploration-based map that engages players with movement or platforming mechanics/masteries, and has some map-progression similar to VB, Drytop or the Silverwastes --a map where exploration takes priority over meta-events and learning how to get around is part of the fun... learning about the world, lore vs. filling my coffers with more pixels.  
---
I think ArenaNet really wrote off the "joy of movement," when they started heavily investing in mounts.  There's a sense of satisfaction and character progression that the LS3 masteries provided that is abruptly absent in LS4.  Mounts are great, but they allow players to trivialize environmental difficulty and obstacles; why interact with other players to solve problems when you can hop on a mount and ignore that difficulty altogether? I think mounts are great for solo players and terrible for socialization. 
---
I've earned over a thousand legendary insights and I've finished the fractal titles before quitting.  I think what GW2 needs in an open world combat capacity is more intuitive, well-communicated mechanics.  I don't think that it's good for the game to be so heavily obsessed with build optimization, DPS rotations or power-creep -- I think mechanics offer a way for players to socialize, group up, work together and build trust, faith and teamwork in each other such as at AB's Octavine or TD's Gerent... In addition I think that more wide-spread usage of mechanics would make it easier to transition to other forms of content (eg; instanced PvE). 
---
Someone asked not too long ago what the difference between Tequatl and the Shattered was.  **Crowd Control,** and truthfully, CC and Defiance Bars are one of, if not, the *most* poorly communicated mechanic in the entire game.  The reason the Shatterer fails is often because isn't because players are "bad," it's because they don't understand how to break crystals.  They don't understand that their CC's aren't created equally, and that's bad design.  
---
The massive neglect of Guild Missions (Rush, Challenge, Trek, Puzzle) is another critical issue for me.  People may not realize this but guild missions? Yeah? They're basically easy-mode raids. The kicker is really just that they're "free." Players have weak fundamentals because they're not building the communication and teamwork that they need to get more value out of the game.  Modern missions that people actually felt inspired to check out and enjoy doing? Crazy talk.  Why would we want that.
---
I just downloaded ESO digital deluxe which has all of the expansions included for $100 which is half what i spent on GW2 this past month. I needed to walk away until they get their act together, if they get it together but this last patch did me in and after ranting for an hour my wife said, why do you continue to play something that pisses you off, a very wise woman lol!
---
I still plan to complete the e-mail to the support branch of NCSoft's executive western branch to explain why i walked away after 7 years , i think they deserve to know who is messing with their revenue.
---
I do enjoy both, however firebrand I spend so much time looking at my utility bar trying to figure out how to get the most damage and trying to get things off timers.
---
Same with dragonhunter, but not as much, I feel like I'm always trying to stare at the timers and forget that I'm dying in the process. I also dislike that a lot of dragonhunters damage comes from set traps or aoes that if an enemy moves out of, you've wastes all your damage and have to rely on does AA or whatever else you have off cool down.
---
Elementalist. So many options to keep in mind at all times, and amazing animations, and just really fun to play. Weaver rotationss flow really well.
---
Ooo, I like this idea.
---
If you want help with the bags make a screenshot and we can tell you what it is and what you need. Or you can also do /wiki thingyoulookfor direct in to the chat and it will take you to a browser that tells you everything about the item. 
---
Maybe start a new character and level some and see if it comes back to you. And don't hesitate to much, try if you pvp and wvw is fun for you. Maybe you might need some other gear or stats or build to get by but still try it. 
---
We also have two expansions and season 2, 3 and 4 all with new maps for each chapter. And mounts and gliding and masteries and so on. Also maybe try and join a social guild who can help you start out so that you can ask all those questions that comes up.
---
they have to actually put their great combat system to use, more content, a thought out plan for the future, better leadership and for fucks sake, stop just treading water
---
also an engine update, why the fuck is the game running on dx9 still?!?! there's even a community dx12 patch, which isn't perfectly obviously but yeah
---
It's too early. It's not likely to drop before the Festival of the Four Winds ends. If that goes on for 3 weeks, it won't be coming out in two weeks.  However, I do expect to hear something at the end of the festival. It might even drop when the festival goes away.
---
Being honest, in all the years of many classes my fondest memories are of playing staff/hammer Rev, with Shiro when HoT was fresh. 
---
Everyone shouting 'CC NOW' and just being able to hit all of the right skills within that window of opportunity felt so good
---
What's the problem with GW2 underwater combat again? Because i really enjoy it.
---
Or you can remove earth and put in fire for not being a pussy. It reduces prot uptime (but you can still get quite some if you use aftershock, which also blasts might and fury and gives reflect and healing glyph while in earth), but increases damage a lot and gives downed lavafont which is a *very* powerful openworld tool, especially in conjunction with LS3 downed skill.
---
Fire also works better with staff, and you would probably want to use that on world bosses, no amount of protection and 0 healing power regen would save meleeing zerk ele there.
---
I never even have warrior the old college try. I've always just seen it as a generic bland fighter class. It seemed uninteresting to me.
---
Everything you say is an improvement however changes of this magnitude won't happen in GW2 but more likely a GW3 if it happens.
---
Is it up to me to demonstrate on the basis of an assumption made, I have in no way claimed to be an expert, I have simply assumed that the fact that the CPU is of a different architecture is the origin of the fact that I experience a more degraded gaming experience with than without. I don't see what I'll have to learn to just be able to judge my experience? Teach me, great master.
---
I read everywhere and I am praised for this tool to improve the FPS, I am just experimenting in my case and note that I have not done anything general when talking about a bad tool, I have mentioned that with my equipment, I was experiencing a degradation of the game.
---
As proof, I'm not going to take you out of the data log, because I'm not talking about that at all, I'm talking about what I'm living in game, when the tool is there and when there's nothing.
---
To make my "proof" I will make it very simple:
---
\- A video of the game, as soon as it is launched with the tool
---
\- A video of the game, as soon as it is launched without the tool
---
You can make your own opinion with these short example.
---
As I said, I don't question CPU usage or FPS (although in my case it's not obvious) but I'm talking about the fact that I can have 200 Fps the glitch I have with it, the textures that are missing, and the slow loading make it unusable in MY CASE.

Depending on your class/elite a few or all of your skills wont work under water, everyone is limited to one or two weapon choices underwater. Oh and alot of people dont bother upgrading the under water gear so it sucks extra for them. I dont mind most underwater stuff, but im really not a fan of how reduced your options are vs land combat.
---
Focus on PvP/WvW because the combat system is what makes GW2 so fun. A lot of PvE mains won't like hearing this, but PvP/WvW always had the most potential in GW2, and ANet seriously dropped the ball when they abandoned these game modes.
---
I prefer they continue adding new and interesting Elite specs, rather than throwing in random new skills to different classes every few patches.  Elite specs include new traits, skills, and a weapon, and usually new stats, and can be designed to work in concert to enable some new and interesting playstyle for that class.  They take more time to explore and optimize, which increases player investment, shakes up otherwise stale balance, and adds more diversity and strategy to the game.
---
I was about the say druid (ranger) sinde nobody said that before. but honestly as a druid main (yes even in open world) im just gonna silently walk away.
---
The same shit over and over is what’s making them money.  FIFA is thier biggest game and one of the biggest releases (arguably the biggest) in EU.  Top tier in the context of the health of a series/game certainly relies on profit as a factor.
---
I like any class that has a relatively strong 1200+ ranged direct DPS option. Currently, that means core elementalist, chronomancer, soulbeast, deadeye, and herald. I don't really have a favorite among them, I just play whichever I'm in the mood for at any given time.
---
Don't walk away! Tell me about it! Why do you play it? Why do you prefer it over soul beast or core ranger?
---
Perfectly acceptable.
---
I think it would be better to just use the pvp interface for it, normal ascended gear stats but no skins.
---
I think if they piggy-backed on an existing system it would be less prone to bugs.
---
Yeah but you derided it as somehow less than the shitty vigor/regen trait. That trait's borderline required on that kind of build! Particularly since you're not taking gale song. That build's going to spend 100% of its time sucking dirt off the ground.

&gt; According to MMOpopulations
---
Which has  no credibility whatsoever given its based on sub reddit numbers.
---
In any game I ever played ever. I always wanted to just sneak around and snipe people with bow and arrow.
---
I thought it was https://www.godsofpvp.net/ over metabattle. But yeah, the meta might change because of the patch.
---
I'd rather them focus on better gameplay and content than better graphics.  10 or 20 yrs ago graphics were important, but they're good enough now that whatever additional value DX12 contributes over DX9 is pretty marginal compared to gameplay and content (especially when ANet is currently struggling with content due to the mobile game mismanagement and subsequent layoffs).
---
I play both engi and mesmer the most and Chrono changes aren't even remotely close to what they did to Holo tbh

Kralk looking great.
---
It basically seems that Anet is abandoning veterans, maybe because they don't generate enough money compared to effort or something, whereas the open world and more casual base can still enjoy the game and are more effectively monetized.
---
Sometimes godsofpvp ends up being a little out of date, but when they're caught up it is pretty reliable
---
Yes i was very disappointed to discover they were leaching off gw2 to develop fucking mobile games. But I’m still having fun. Still login every day to wvw and do dailies. Still have fun with raids. 
---
Game is still good. Yes. But it needs love. 
---
We need an expansion. And we need the game to deliver on some much needed improvements. Like D X11.  I mean, if some lone programmer can produce a hack to make Gw2 do DX11. Get off your laurels, and get it done. Come on.
---
I honestly love the feeling of spamming them heals in a well stacked group and just generally be providing useful boons and utility. even when in massive zerg fights i will go for my 100% heal uptime rotation even though i totally cant see where my heal and boons go or if they even do anything... still feels nice to help people out i guess. the spirits give situational buffs and the glyphs situational utility, thats what i like most.
---
I'd still love to see a renaissance of chrono druid (especially after chrono got nerfed even further) and a comeback viability of druids in fractals.
---
that was before they started making money off it. once they profiting from it, all talks of improvement are thrown out the window. something very had happened to the art direction of this game
