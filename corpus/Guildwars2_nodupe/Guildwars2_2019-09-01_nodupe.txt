As someone who's been trading stocks for some time now, this is something I try to instill in people around me. Companies aren't your friends. They're just there to provide a product or enrich shareholders. That's it. Stop attaching human attributes to them, people. If they fail to deliver, that is that. There's no need to come out in their defense.
---
---
---
Are you feeling okay? Or replying to wrong person ?
---
Well Fractals are not living story content or cosmetics, so yes assume they are dead or will be dead.
---
Yeah I'm good without following/subscribing someone I don't care for.  
---
Good luck everyone who bothers.
---
Ever since the whole Price incident I've also felt that with this game in particular the devs see themselves as being completely separate from the community. I actually wonder if any of them even activily play their own game or just games in general. I don't know it just all kinda feels off to me.
---
No, you have to use costume brawl skills only, and they do no damage
---
Another day, another random complaint nobody cares of.. keep it up.
---
only problem is that she's been at it since at least last sunday, which is rather convenient, as feedback and reactions regarding ANets own announcement can just be swept under the same umbrella.
---
&gt;400 employees is a lot, no Mmo has a team that size.
---

---
I agree. The problem is their ability to produce content, features and systems for GW2 with however many people they have had on it, has been woeful.
---
&gt; The expansion type comment is simply an excuse to legitimate baseless attacks.
---
Not really, it is simply one of things that created increased expectations.
---
&gt; where is it written that an expansion has to have raids ?
---
It isn't, but then I didn't specifically mention raids and no the lack of a raid by itself wouldn't be a source of criticism in this regard. The fact that in addition to no raids, PvP/WvW basically got nothing, that the living meme that is the 7 year wait for build templates is still not even there yet, no new elites, etc, basically a complete lack of stuff that is "expansion type content".
---
Which is then made worse for PvP/WvW because they have already been waiting a laughable length of time for things like Aliiances, Swiss, even the removal of monthly AT, etc.
---
The time it takes Anet to put out content, new features, new systems is absolutely laughable, which is why their game has fallen behind the likes of ESO which pumps out 3 DLCs, and a mini-expansion a year and partly why their revenue is at the laughable levels it is (20-25%) higher than Aion...
---
It is just another example of Anet marketing ineptitude.
---
we can accept this fate or defy it, but we cannot deny it
---
 "*Shante*, *you stay*"
---
That's gold. I will save it.
---
'Liked' is an understatement.
---
That was friggin awesome.
---
Interesting difference. The left one has that vibe you expect from most ghost-ish creatures...but the one on the right? THAT is something I'd be terrified of running into, it looks far more dangerous and threatening.
---
Content Marketing Manager, you dumbwit
---
Yet another drone that did zero research trying to pin the blame on the players and not on ANet.
---
Ok, hold the fuck up, do you people have family working at ArenaNet or something? So many defend them through their bullshit as if you had a personal stake in the company. Only people that need a necessary reality check is people like yourself.
---
&gt;i gotta say that i find i quite convenient for her to start ranting about toxicity directed at people in the gaming industry shortly before the company
---
What are you on about? She made these comments AFTER the event, in RESPONSE to the reactions.
---
Why does WvW have to be only conquest and only towers you can only enter by breaking the gate/wall?
---
When the game initially launched, there were competitive events in WvW where players compete to win factor over a tribe of NPCs by doing the event objective while sabotaging the opposing team. 
---
I'm not saying whether it was good or not, but it is an example and proof of concept for: Competitive Events.
---
What would an open world map be like if three teams were competing for dominance around the area? It's a neat thought experiment, and something that might bridge the gap between PvE and WvW.
---
Of course, they could also do other game modes than competitive events. Maybe we could have a map based around King of the Hill?  Or maybe they could bring back Fortune's Vale?  What if they revisit the Obsidian Sanctum concept where a server contests the end of a long dungeon, and have to fend off players progressing through it using siege and traps? (I'm actually nostalgic for 2013 when Obsidian Sanctum was that kind of map...)
---
The point is that they can do a LOT with WvW. When you have three servers going at each other, you can do all sorts of objectives! MUCH more than tower conquest!
---
The people who like tower conquest already have borderlands and EBG. I want something NEW!
---
&gt; Undercutting by 1 copper is done to preserve the overall value of the item, not to be a jerk. ""Undercutting."" """"""Preserves the price."""""""
---
T. One-Copper Undercutter. You know matching the price has the same affect all without slowly driving down the price of an item, don't you? Nah, you didn't think of then when you were neurotically undercutting to place yourself in the front of the line like a selfish idiot.
---
Yes. Nearly everything gives you XP and the progression is linear not quadratic. Kills mobs, doing Hearts, Events (orange stuff), discovering new places, seeing Vistas, gatherings, resing players/npcs, and crafting give XP.
---
Though the idea is it's kinda lost due the expansion GW2 was designed to "play right now, how you want, when you want" not "grind till cap then the game starts". Take your time and enjoy Tyria, there are lots of nooks and crannies out to explore.
---
I'm with you on the right one. It feels...more terrifying, more threatening. more dangerous. Left is...I dunno, generic deer skulled creature we've fought in multiple other games?
---
I don't really see it as a problem. AFAIK, she doesn't make content for the game, and the game content she does speak about comes on a script. I dont think she has as much to say about direct game content as we think she does.
---
All the people in denial about classic WoW saying it's nostalgia when it's just good game design.
---
Legit the most excited I have been for a GW villain in a long time.
---
You can't talk this way to customers. When you disappoint people who pay your salary you better expect a reaction. This is the most common problem in business and they can't even handle it.
---
I've spent thousands on the game after 7 years. Apparently my money was spent on side projects while they killed the content I liked. What reaction did they expect?
---
I've seen people just as mad over messed up dinners at restaurants I've worked in. And when I disappoint a customer at work you better believe I'm contrite. BECAUSE THEY PAID US MONEY.
---
Me from headstart with none of these skins: oh man i hope one of these skins is worth it. got a lawless glove skin :D
---
Yes if you already owned HoT you will get 2 letters. 1 will have the "Heart of Thorns Emblem Clothing Outfit". The other letter will have a "Mordrem Glider" and "Heart of Thorns Veteran's Armor Voucher". Mine took about 24 hours to show up.
---
It's funny to see people at a floundering company pretend to play the victim. You set expectations, you didn't  provide anything of substance and now you're being called on it. For adults your company sure is comprised of a lot of cry babies with no semblance of thick skin. 
---
Your streams are below industry standards, your release schedule is below standards, your communication is below standards, how on gods green earth could you honestly think anything good would come of that, your company should be embarrassed over what you did with that theater not defensive of it. 
---
Do better.
---
Combat and massive multiplayer experiences make the game enjoyable. On the other hand story content is not why I play MMOs.
---
its not a giveaway, if you ask for subscriptions or retweets in return
---
Im dissapointed with this reaction. They defend theirselves from the extreme haters but still nothing about what is going on.
---
Stop acting like victims and tell us where is the problem. We love this game and we want to help.
---
The fact that they did it says they thought it was a good idea.
---
I mean... We had 9 month cadence release for raids from W4? maybe, W5 for sure. So we'll se in may.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
RemindMe! 7 months
---
He said he is going to play GW2 how it was intended, 3 hours every 4 months.
---
Go to the Matthew Medina thread plenty of examples there. 
---
Ruby also mentioned people are rampantly engaging in hyperbole and guess what you can look at your own post for an example of that. Every trick in the book to make you spend 200 bucks a month? How on what ? That's not true even if you had to buy everything they release on the cash shop always. I guess the most expensive months would be when they release a new weaponset in blc but because anet most certainly do not use every trick in the book to get you to pay they made that tradable and generally sell for around 30g a piece when they release meaning you can buy them all for less then 600g which if you had to buy exclusively using real money it would cost less then 40 bucks.
---
Very slow and they have always been like that. Expect 2 or more weeks for almost anything.
---
The fact that you have to ask these questions speaks for itself.
---
&gt; Nobody plays this game only for the story content
---
That's a bold and untrue statement. I agree that the fact that they are neglecting the other gamemodes is killing the game, but I also believe that story and lore are very important for a fantasy world. I wish they balanced it better.
---
The problem is that dungeons were flawed from ground up. The only way to fix them was a full rework, and Fractals happened to be that rework. They were very linear, but with a choice of paths. The problem was, that choice meant the dungeons were completely non-canon. Nothing that happens in them actually happens. None of the characters, unless mentioned outside dungeons, exist. Even the locations don't.
---
The only way to fix dungeons was remove what made them dungeons. So instead, they made that fix into fractals. Dungeons remained popular while they were the best gold farm by far and you were basically forced to run them. Once the gold way nerfed, the only people who would run dungeons are those who truly enjoyed them. As it turns out, by that point the number of those people was very small, and dungeons died.
---
I also thought the voice is hot.
---
Maybe I should commission an artist into drawing Jormag anthropomorphized into a cute anime girl.
---
Don't have to, I learned about my country's past in school and also visited the concentration camp in Buchenwald. Sadly the right political party Alternative für Deutschland (Alternative for Germany) is gaining popularity right now, especially in the eastern parts of the country.
---
Well I had hot for about 10 months now so, guess it just didn't arrive yet, thanks for the answer
---
My average ping is 66 with FPS being 60. I think I'm going to try and figure out how to run a Traceroute.
---
&gt;Yes it is, and yes it is.
---
and you're the same guy who said "Three question marks does not a dispute make."
---
also lets have a cucumber gender for all i care. its just you giving a fuck about this
---
GOOD :3
---
Do you have something like Revolut? That might work.
---
I know this will sound cliche and I really don't know what else to say other than I'm not angry, just disappointed. As a casual player I am grateful for the new saga info.......but I was really expecting some completely new or expansion-like as promised. I like the low-key raids.....but do they have story and sort of minimaps? Or just a 10 man boss? Build templates were mentioned for like 2 min. What about a new fractal that is supposed to be coming with this release? (or is episode 1 and not this prologue?) And I know tons of people have asked about PvP and WvW.....what about the forum QnA? Idk.....
---
and what did she do ? huh..
---
The official response have to be carefully crafted yeah, or even more ppl will be disappointed. Oh and don't worry about not getting any dev addressing, they don't like to answer questions even in more calm days.
---
Molten Furnace is so unnecessarily cancer now, holy balls
---
With all the criticism I've exposed in my posts after the event, I agree in the main point that Rubi exposes: menaces are EXCESSIVE and a lame attitude, considered as a crime in so many countries. Those who fell into the insult, into the direct menace against Arenanet's workers or related of them, should feel ASHAMED of their attitude. This ISN'T the way how a community exposes its point. EVER.
---
Said this, I hope Rubi (and others who could be posting in Twitter/Reddit/wherever) isn't falling in putting everybody in the same sack, 'cos this would be a worst fail even. There is people who exposed their criticism with facts, with clear point, and being polite even into their frustration and disappointment. And these are the voices that Arenanet SHOULD be listening right now.
---
Once more, in case someone missed the point, the critics about the event AREN'T related with the content they exposed (that is fine and it looks great), but about the content they didn't mention AT ALL: fractals, raids, instances, WvW, PvP... all this was ignored in an event that, for exposing what was told, felt excessively "show time".
---
If, as some people suggested, this event was a try to say "hey, we're alive (as company), we're not closing GW2, etc etc"... well, they are the only guilty about this feeling, since the company wasted resources and time in projects about we never will know a word, 'cos NCSoft cancelled them, and the game stayed in a standby situation, with two game modes and concrete content that been falling in the hole for years.
---
THIS is the real point of the critics of MANY players, and THIS is what Arenanet should be listening with attention, not the mindless rage of a very small group of people that, probably, not even play GW2 at all.
---
&gt;at least as it pertains to biological reasons outside of classified deformities.
---
calling intersex ppl "deformities" is sth that should get you banned. also do you exclude gingers from arguments too? you know they make up the same amount of people? are gingers deformities?
---
I like the power sword build because it's a fairly short and simple rotation that loops cleanly and feels satisfying. I like that it's only really gated by your speed at pressing buttons. It's cool that if you want to improve the damage further, you can pay attention to counting your autoattacks so that you get full autoattack chains.
---
I wouldn't call them challenging. They are designed to be beaten by 10 random players using an automated group finder. If you ever did Freezy with a dps meter you will know what to expect from the majority of players.
---
Ah shit, no I didn't think of that.  I tried turning it off and on first but no dice.
---
[And I will continue to do so](https://imgur.com/a/Xvtzm5F), anything else would be stupid.
---
About 90% of your listed items will sell regardless of being undercut, the difference is that some may take a bit to clear due to market fluctuations. 
---
I get undercut all the time, it's really no big deal.
---
I believe that was fractal Ben, the guy who brought us 99CM and 100CM, who did unfortunately move on from the company during the layoffs.
---
What makes a "Saga" unique compared to a "Season." ?
---
cant help but feeling the shutdown of this game is near. no support from dev, no support from the players, what's there left to support the game?
---
You can give gw2launcher a try. Basically you store all your information within the launcher and then you can login all your accounts at same time or just launch the one you need with one click until character select screen. There is one more alternative to this launcher and it is Gw2launchbuddy but I am not sure if its still under active development.
---
Here is a readme if you are interested.
---
https://github.com/Healix/Gw2Launcher/blob/master/README.md
---
For me the most important question is how many devs are working in GW2 in the studio.
---
Rytlock. He’s been to the mists and back.
---
Wait, you can play CoH?
---
you clearly missed his point, no one fuckin cares if you enjoy playing minesweeper either
---
Im pretty sure that you are talking more about gw2 than actually play it
---
The fact you got mass down voted proves your point. Sigh.
---
Any way to participate without following/subscribing/retweeting people I don't know? I thought it's a giveaway and no sweepstake...
---
Bangar looks like a troll pencil pusher
---
What’s funny about Rubi is she states on her account saying “I don’t do work here” yet she’s talking about work drama concerning players and the drama with guild wars 2... god I can’t stand her!
---
They kinda already have in a lot of places, but let's keep hoping that this thread will stay neat in tone and on topic - even if no surprise dev comments appear out of nowhere^^
---
no, you are the majority, which is why they do Living Story content continuously. The problem with GW2 is that the majority consist of a lot of players(not entirely) who come for the new content and maybe spend some hours exploring said new content and then leaving till more content gets introduced. 
---
The complaints come from more of the hardcore community, who although are the minority, spend much more time in game on average than the majority.
---
This causes a huge disconnect with who to aim content for, the majority who on average play less, or the minority who play more often. (There are also some of the majority who play a lot as well, e.g crafters, achievement hunters and such, but they are a minority of the majority who gets new content in the form of Living story content). And because ANet primarily focus' on the majority, the number of long hour players are dwindling
---
Specialized mono-gamers that are interested in competitive PvP or WvW or instanced endgame tend to be more frustrated than the "average" GW2 player like yourself that's played like 5-6 different games in the last 6 months to a year.  You're a silent majority playing the game the way that it's being designed to be played; hopping back and forth between games whereas lots of us are bound by certain competitive obligations (eg; automated tournaments, wvw raids, pve raids, fractals).  When people in our sort of crowd hop games we tend to burn bridges and building new social relationships / "giving up our spots" is rough because we run the risk of not having anyone to play the game with at a decent skill level when we return.
---
Really disappointing that they're still blind to the facts. Stop using the vocal minority as an excuse for doing a bad job.
---
Reventing the wheel is Anets thing. Did you not know? Lion's Arch is a representation of Anet within the game which is why it's getting rebuilt over and over again until it looks like a theme park.

I need to visit this place more often. 🙃
---
it cant get any more dark and gritty than shadowbringers, imagine someone saying no one deserves to die a painful death then 1 second later said character screams in agony as she gets something worse than death and she screams for her mother.
---
They prefer to play victim.  Every time there is community backlash the victimhood stuff shows up.  They know very well that those people are the minority but always feel the need to address them rather than the legitimate messages.  This is classic deflection.
---
Honestly it goes beyond Anet.  Anytime there is public outcry to something the response is almost always about receiving death threats.  People have discovered that if you put it out there that you're receiving death threats, even if you aren't, then more people will respond with sympathy rather than criticism.
---
Yeah... It's really sad to see a game I spent so much time on go down a road completely different from the start. Dungeons were awesome, and if they'd added more dungeons as well as other things to make dungeons more repeatable, like daily/weekly/monthly/all-time leaderboards with rewards for being top groups in the categories, like temporary titles that have special colors to distinguish them from other titles, or effects, or other icons in your character's nameplate.
---
For the past year I've pretty much stopped playing gw2 entirely, I don't think I've been logged in for more than an hour combined.
---
On the bright side, a found a new home on black desert, and have completely fallen in love with that game, despite the developers suffering some of the same problems as Anet.
---
you know this is exactly the kinda questions that will we never get answers from the dev
---
I guess this is why Valve does the 4000 iq play of telling their playerbase absolutely nothing. Most people aren't smart enough, or civil enough, to just appreciate transparency. Oh well, looking forward to radio silence in the future. This is why we can't have nice things. Or mediocre things to provide constructive feedback to. Oh well.
---
&gt;Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel.
---
I'll look into this. I don't have a Win7 machine but maybe I can set up a VM or something and test it there; I'd guess it probably has to do with the .NET version differences between Windows 10 (.NET 4.6 installed by default) and Windows 7 (.NET 3.5 installed by default). If you want to try it, it's possible that installing .NET 4.6 could work for you.
---
seems like we all dont get to hear what we want these days. deal with it.
---
please from the trailer we know rytlock could have kept going with that beat down lol
---
If you look at what they talked about, they talked about HoT free with PoF sales. They weren't talking to us. That wasn't their goal. We complain they don't do anything to promote the game. Anet went to a con to promote the game. They have staff on panels at the con as well. That's all they were doing. And their efforts to promote the game, to some degree, are hamstrung by the reactions of the fan base who are so overwhelmingly negative.
---
  
---
I said long before this, on reddit, that this announcement wasn't for us. No one believe me then, but after seeing the announcement, how can you not believe that?
---
FYA, it's not only in your industry sis'. It's when you play with feelings. Look the final of GoT. 
---
Write "You can't satisfy everyone" on a post it and put it on your fridge, it's the number one rule.
---
I think you're completely wrong, anyone who wanted to WvW has done WvW. imo there's essentially nothing they can do at this point to bring people into either WvW or PVP. They could make it more fun for the people who already play it, but that's about it.
---

---
I'm sorry, totally out of loop. What time of berate did Rubi had to take recently? (I don't play the game anymore so)
---
While it's not uncommon for a fellow dev to get stepped on and she's getting angry about it.
---
eso, bdo
---
Agreed. Why would they ever respond when this is the result of transparency.
---
I genuinely wonder how 150+ people all probably working 40 hours a week manage to produce nothing.
---
I just got into WvW after 3500ish hours of PvE, and all of those points are true. I don't even like any sort of pvp, either. 
---
HOWEVER, joining a ts/discord channel and just listening to what the com of the zerk is up to is a gamechanger. That gives me some sense of direction and confidence, and ultimately made me come back,even though I still stuck at it
---
I reread your comment and have to give my thoughts on this one:
---
&gt; With the only remarks about raids being how time consuming they are and how hard it is to find enough friends to do them ?
---
This made me actually angry. The only time they ever mention raids is to say negative things about it. Anet, why??? That's not how you promote your own content.
---
Wouldnt it be nice if they made like a dungeon instance in HoT dragon stand map where they basically fill out missing HoT lore like nightmare court and malyck tree? Its been a wet dream of mine..
---
I'm 11 AP points away from my 37 k chest. I have 24 legendary weapons, my last one completed just a week ago. I have two legendary back pieces. I have two legendary trinkets. All the mounts obviously and max masteries.  I'm level 904 in WvW,. level 93 in PvP and level 97 in Fractals. I've obviously played the game. Pretty much the only thing I don't do is raid.
---
I also have finished the story and every zone on 15 characters. I run a guild with about 350 people. Today we're running guild missions.
---
On what basis do you claim that I don't play the game?
---
Anet as a company NEEDS to regain our confidence and create a roadmap for all the game modes. What is after season 5? Is the franchise over? Any more elite specs? Will there be any expansions again or will it just be Living World? What is the future looking like? Not just what is happening in the next couple months.
---
Do devs believe that people will keep investing if the players don’t have confidence in the game? The revenues will stay stagnant or go down, but I highly doubt it will improve.
---
Yup, They have terrible management and they have an even worse Marketing team. They can barely even adapt the practices of other current successful games like season passes and such. What a waste.
---
If those 3 are the worst that you can find, then there were not abusive threads as the header and the top few comments in each *are not abusive*.
---
Even if they are, someone who’s job is to do PR (which should involve internet communications) needs to be able to handle fairly tame internet language without ranting onto twitter about it.
---
Isn't Ruby just a Community Manager (CM)?
---
This is the new world boss yes?
---
Don't be a dumbass, you just make us look like even bigger idiots when you downplay any abuse they might be getting. Absolutely continue to criticize them, but we need to be turning around and calling out abuse, otherwise our complaints will continue to get lumped in with assholes.
---
You're completely separated from reality if you need ANet to tell you that an announcement at PAX was NOT:
---
* A rally event for team morale
---
* An event only NCSoft planned
---
I've tried to say this as many times over the last few days and maybe I've reached a few people with it, but the answer is far simpler and doesn't require ANet to be your personal adversary:
---
* PAX is a video game conference and the companies that present there are advertising what they're working on. ANet advertised to the gaming community that GW2 is still alive and releasing content in under a month.
---
It didn't answer most of the concerns that diehard veteran players have, but that was never the point and not what ANet stated about the announcement. Go read the announcement. [A Special Live Event](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/join-us-for-a-special-live-event-on-august-30). 
---
They have been in a pattern now for YEARS that updates for WvW, PvP, and Raids, and PvE are all on their own schedules, and each get their own announcements as features/content becomes ready. It's been this way for YEARS and the GW2 community is up in arms that a Living World announcement didn't solve WvW or PvP even when ANet acknowledged changes for both will be announced soon.
---
The outrage is insane. You people need...and I really mean NEED....to take a step back and reflect on how you're behaving. This goes far beyond just being concerned about the games future. We're all concerned about the future of a franchise that some of us have enjoyed for almost 15 years now. That's no excuse for pretending like ANet is doing nothing at all or saying that ANet didn't live up to what they "hyped" for in the Aug 30 announcement.
---
To be fair the GW2 community has been against each other for a while, it's why I kind of laugh whenever people say GW2 has a great community. It's really no better than any other MMO.
---
You can try the Snow Crows website
---
I didn't know that...fuck yes!
---
what is up with these posts.  this is not a comprehensive "take" on everything the community is saying.  this is specifically about people who are being shitbags.  framing it this way gives people the excuse to say "well i havent been sending death threats what a crap generalization".
---
I'm the opposite: the original design for Drakkar wasn't super iconic (imo), I'd love to see something a bit more original?
---
I cut my hand opened just before a Concert "Wintersday in July" with my Guild, so I was a Stage Asset for that night!

Yes. They didnt show that much, right? It was more about talking than actually showing
---
Bold of you to assume we’d even get an ”Unkown” from arena net.
---
If you aren't having fun with the subreddit, just leave :\^)
---
&gt;I played it myself until i started getting kicked from Raids for not meeting the 30k+ DPS quota.
---
Unless you are really low, you are never going to be kicked for 'low' DPS. There is no such a thing as a '30k dps quota', so it's highly likely you were kicked for other reasons. Also Spellbreaker does do 30k-ish on the golem, so, um, there's also that. Of course you must understand that golem DPS isn't often reflective of 'real scenario' dps, and this is true for classes like Reaper or the 'dead' PBM Holo as well, and especially so for Mirage and Firebrand (latter getting tome resets, former with confusion)
---
&gt;and boon ripping is an amazing ability to have. But lacking reliable damage kills it completely.
---
Consider that these two might be related.
---
&gt;I do not mean speedkill level good. I mean being able to quickly kill targets,or being able to provide significant DPS to a Boss encounter of any kind
---
Reaper is able to do both these things. Gravedigger makes it very good for that, even, and shroud has high cleave, and it can pull with GS5 or Spectral Grasp, the latter of which is one of the best pulls in the game that isn't on Mesmer Focus. And a very important question: Do **you** actually play Reaper, or Necro in general, or are you just parroting things and making a fool of yourself in a very poor attempt to seem like your idea of a high end player? That's accusatory, but I'm not going to hide what I actually think.
---
&gt;Scourge does only have those 2 things. Soulbeast also has a fuckton of Burst,Condition cleanse for 5 dudes that pulses for a good duration and also heals,shared stances,a shit-ton of burst damage. It is a complete DPS class,with a decent skill ceiling,a low skill floor,and team utility to boot. Then again,Scourge being good on Dhuum and Dhuum alone is not exactly great.
---
Condi Scourge is way more useful than a Power Soulbeast to most squads. Power Soulbeast has high burst but basically very low sustained DPS and really requires the entire encounter to line up well for it. Scourge also has the condition cleanse and unlike Power Soulbeast isn't utterly screwed over by having to move. Scourge is not 'good' on Dhuum alone, by the way. It's good on VG, Sabetha, Xera, MO, Deimos (especially pugs who have trouble with Prides), Soulless Horror, Qadim 2 (it's one of the *very few* classes that can pylon kite, even). Scourge gets really good for a lot of Raid CMs on top of that - because Scourge's utility, is, god forbid you want to admit it, actually really good for dealing with a lot of CM mechanics in particular and people have noticed this. It's versatile, way more than Power Soulbeast. Ofc there's condi soulbeast for where power soulbeast is, but condi soulbeast is significantly less reliant on numerous things being good than power soulbeast is so I used it as an example. 
---
&gt;It is a complete DPS class,with a decent skill ceiling,a low skill floor,and team utility to boot.
---
So, you realise this is true of Scourge and Reaper too, right? 
---
&gt;As a Honest answer,yes,i have done all raids so far,and i am rank 94 on Fractals,but i have done them up to 100
---
It is clear I will not get through to you, so I will say: It does not sound like you do weekly clears or fractal CMs often with the way you have worded that. If you want to think only in terms of raw DPS, that's your prerogative, but it never comes down to that alone except on the most golem-like of bosses. And even then, maybe debatable. 
---
I am not closing myself off to this discussion, but this habit of instantly shooting down something or calling a class bad does you no favours to anyone and doesn't make you look good to anyone. Something like Power Scrapper, people would agree. Power Reaper though? People would agree with you like two years ago. These days, it's completely unfounded. Power Reaper is in a really strong space considering that it self buffs itself so much, stronger than some would like, even. Guarantee you that if you put a good player on Reaper, and put them in the average pug squad, the Reaper is likely end up near or be the top DPS on most bosses that are good for power dps. This is a personal meme, but my take is that Reaper is just an edgy DH at this point. (albeit you can't share quickness)
---
As much as I feel sorry for the devs taking the brunt of insults, berating and other stuff that should just be kept to whoever is spreading them, Anet went wrong with how they delivered their announcement of the upcoming release by building too much unnecessary hype... Hyping stuff that they have worked on for a long time is fine, but making a “special announcement” just for what people were expecting to come at come point without much anything new, bar some actually “kinda new” features that the vast majority of people have already asked for since pretty much the beginning was pretty much uncalled for. A blog post would have been enough and would have probably wouldn’t have garnered as much hate, disappointment and frustration.
---
Now if Anet would have actually had some seriously new stuff to announce like new elite specializations for example, or a big feature pack with lots of new stuff that most likely will include build templates, making a “special announcement” would have been fine, basically stuff that they can actually show off on a stream. Maybe stuff that people weren’t expecting at all is also fine... maybe.
---
In the end of all that both the players and the devs suffer... in the end I hope that Anet will learn from all this fiasco and maybe for the future releases and what ever else that is yet to come, Anet will “build up the good amount of hype” that whatever they release is worthy of and hopefully make the correct type of announcements for said content (blog posts for small contents and super big announcements with streams to show off for bigger contents)
---
As a side note, the stream was fine for what they’re releasing now, but the hype made everyone thing that there will be MUCH more, which is again about building up too much hype. Please build up hype in moderation in the future...
---
Grats and now u look my uncle still into printed graphic tees and calling it fashion
---
Yeah DE has gotten really good at making sustainable content through nightwave when there is a drought, and this allows them to work things out in their own pace
---
There is no current event going on (AP related and foreshadows future storylines) and Anet is wondering why we feel that there is nothing planned or to do in the game. Anet insists on putting out content on within 3 to 4 month windows - and all at once. Its idiotic.
---
Don't take every comment ever written as gospel.  There are moderates that lie between every opinion.  There's just little point trying to argue with irrationally emotional opinions.
---
I didn't downvote you, and people shouldn't. The downvote button is meant for comments that add nothing to a discussion, and you certainly added something important here.
---
I think the crux of the misunderstanding is that, from my perspective at least, you appear to be a pretty casual player. That doesn't mean uninvested, and it doesn't mean unskilled, and it doesn't mean you don't play a lot, but it does mean that you don't seem to focus on getting everything unlocked as soon as you can and grinding hardcore content like raids to be the best in game. For players like that (of which there are surprisingly many), the direction the game is going and by extension the announcement has been and was a big disappointment, as it appears that we're basically just getting more filler content with no new way to play the game (elite specs), and things like wvw updates, pvp updates, and wing 8 have no set dates at all in any way, so we have no idea when the gamemodes we enjoy are actually going to get updated.
---
Players like you are ANet's target audience along with the ultra-casuals who don't play very often. You will be satisfied content-wise by the Living Story releases, and you're still working through existing content at a pace that means that ANet will always have something "coming up" for you that you can be excited about. This just simply is no longer true for a lot of veterans, whether they've exhausted *all* the content or the majority of content just doesn't appeal to them (rather empty story missions as far as combat is concerned and major shortcomings in all endgame gamemodes). It frustrates a lot of people to see what this game could be vs. what it's becoming, is all.
---
Mic drop.
---
What a dumb fucking point. "Well I can't see any abuse happening, so I guess that means it doesn't exist."
---
This is how you lose support. Enjoy screaming into the void like a bunch of idiots because no one will take us seriously because we can't even control our own side and less and less people taking you seriously as you progressively sound more insane. The death of many movements before us and many more after us.
---
How much is ANet paying you to shill them on the subreddit these days krall?
---
#qualitycontent
---
&gt; and felt slightly insulted
---
Why?
---
&gt; This feels like a money grabbing game
---
Because they announced more free content? I mean I get that the merch sales pitch was ...ewww, but that wasn't really part of the announcement.
---
&gt;The entire community is at rage, and almost no one’s defending Anet anymore
---
No, big parts of reddit are and reddit is an important platform for the community, but it is also a platform that tends to gather up the parts of the community that like to complain most. Do not equate the two.
---
&gt; Last straw. I’ll be starting saying all things possible against the game from now on, and stop any new players from playing the game.
---
So you ended up at the point where you are trying to threaten the devs into givign you what you want? I get the "x stages of grief" thing, but this is just so cringy.
---
Rejoicing for someone who lost a job. That's as trash as it can gets.
---
I kind of assuming this subreddit was starting to burn out.
---
I'm glad Anet decided to relight the fire.
---
This is exactly my thoughts. What they announced was better than what i've come to expect from them but man, the build-up was just self-destructive. It is incredibly hard, if not nigh impossible to recover from let-down hype.
---
:/ get some help.
---
Get it from the promotions tab in the Gem Store if you haven't figured it out yet.
---
The community was already feeling pesemistic about gw2 future, then the annoucement was hyped up for *weeks* to basically announce ”Yeah it’s the exact same thing with one or two different spicies in the mix”.
---
&gt; You're literally bored of gw2. Otherwise you would play it right now
---
What if he has a pc that is so powerfull that he can run gw2 and google chrome with reddit open at the same time? Not many people are that rich but there is a possibility.
---
I wish this Bit&amp;h gets fired. She's gaining too much weight already
---
I'm happy! I have 36 characters and lots to occupy my time with. I've been working on PvP and getting better every season. I've got great outfits for everyone and lots and lots of maps to visit.
---
I'm content with this beautiful and fun game.
---
This was amazing, I'm actually legit hyped for a new part of the story.. Which it's been a long time since I've been this hyped, before I was like ehhhh new story whatever. So glad we are going to the far shiverpeaks!
---
she didn't say that
---
I'm aware, and I'm sympathetic. I don't mean like preventing doxxing or creating a controlled space like forums to facilitate healthy interactions. I mean, they actively avoid any dialogue with the community, healthy or otherwise.
---
What if I have two monitors and I can click out easily?
---
Dubstep.  I hate it.
---
I will accept nothing but Sandstorm.
---
Link it to me when it's up, bby.
---
also try to be funny when you are not trolling.
---
This is what I'm wondering.  By excitement I meant on Anet's end.  I don't get why they hyped this.
---
Her "job" stomped on my freedom of speech, often enough for no valid reason. So good riddance from me. If she's so great, she'll easily find another job, hopefully away from forums i use.
---
That's... not at all what she said, though.
---
In a way, I fear that Anet has been so insulated from criticism a lot of  their staff now thinks any criticism is toxicity.
---
Yes, if Roy wears them.
---
"its a game derp it should not challenge me at all derp stress be bad for muh well being harp"
---
Time to erase chess and pretty much every other fucking board game where failure is even a remote possibility. Everybody's a winner.
---
&gt; PvP: Will we ever get other competitive game modes? Will duos ever be moved to their own queue with trios?
---
And they talked about the idea of mini seasons between the main conquest ones that could be 2v2 or 3v3 so.... they did give us an idea.
---
Anyhow: I don't think any of the questions you listed are super unreasonable, but expecting to get most of them answered in an event that was explicitly presented as a LW announcement was =)
---
Here's my comunication skillz to Anet: Uninstal ..............
---
That's what they all are.
---
Another one of these stupid "am i the only one?" threads.
---
No, you're not and you know it.
---
 https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/
---
You're completely missing the entire point anybody has tried to make if you believe the special announcement event which literally repeated the same exact talking points Mike Z had in Feb was worth having at all. This is literally why people started to make up theories about how the event was for team morale or because NCsoft planned it to push merch because THERE WAS LITERALLY NOTHING NEWLY ANNOUNCED. Everything we already knew was coming, including WvW alliances and build templates/large QOL improvements. Great, Season 5 now has a name. Totally worth the "special announcement event" thank you rhazux for that rationalization. 
---
Besides, your justifications are incredibly stupid. Have you not realized that WvW/PvP/etc communities have been providing feedback FOR YEARS on how anet has been doing nothing? Of course a "special announcement event" in which devs come up on stage and say "wvw alliances are coming soon..." is going to make people angry BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN SAYING IT FOR YEARS. 
---
Seriously, wake the fuck up. You need to stop handwaving literally everything because god forbid someone have any sort of emotion toward this game that isn't vehemently defending everything devs do.
---
Oh I never played it, always wanted to after seeing some old videos though
---
Yaaaay
---
I prefer being serious or sarcastic when not trolling.
---
&gt; if you look at other platforms outside of reddit response has been pretty positive.
---
Like where? The forums with trigger-happy mods that instantly ban anyone who says anything negative?
---
What a god.
---
&gt;Lw5 story has potential to be best one we ever had. Most dark and dirty.
---
You got that from one teaser and one tiny cutscene of Rytlock punching someone?
---
My guess for the VA actress is Jamie Clayton from *Sense8.*

---
hmm  i was thinking Xeb tbh
---
I have thoroughly enjoyed Power weaver, though I've definitely had some survivability issues. Awhile back I considered running condi weaver because it looked a little tougher, but I ended up going power because I could just go staff for unfriendly fights. But now that I'm making a second set of gear, I have to decide if I am making a new stat line or more of the same.
---
As a special note, I currently have three power crit characters right now.
---
He not asking for subscriptions just a follow. Most giveaway I have seen require that a follow/retweets so it seem standard.  Most twitch giveaway are use as a promotional tool used to improve awareness of their twitch/twitter/YouTube. I don't see anything wrong with it but that just my opinion.
---
Are the devs even allowed to answer questions?
---
Its also possible this was called a saga as WP put it, help get people out of the mind frame of what seasons were. Stop rushing the story content and taking the episodes with a new mindset.
---
Why are raids toxic? If anything, there are very helpful discord servers that actually patiently teach you each raid boss. Just because you like casual content (which is fine nothing wrong with that) don’t call hardcore players toxic or the ones that want to learn and actually get better in the game.
---
Yeah i already forgot about the mini season thing lol. Off season is only like 1-2 weeks anyway so I can't imagine that will be a game changer in any way.
---
I lived GW1 to death like 10,000+ hours. I have barely played 300hr in GW2. Every time I want to redownload the game I’m reminded that support is dead.
---
😐
---
&gt; Maybe we could have a map based around King of the Hill?
---
I'm all for different style maps and objectives in WvW, don't get me wrong. But because of the way the game is designed, nothing is going to solve your problem of zergs vs. small squad gameplay. In fact, King of the Hill would be the absolute worst kind of format for a game mode that already involves 50 man zergs ramming into each other. It would be inner Stonemist all day in a KotH style map.
---
I'm beginning to think it's because they don't have answers themselves.
---
And yet Digital Extremes has made fun of players and fought tooth and nail against what the players want, because they "know what the players want better than the players do."
---
I honestly don't know why people enjoy Warframe so much. It's literally a graphical hamster wheel. There's no sense of progression, just hoarding weapons that are either a side-grade, or are inferior to what players have now. Or they're broken as hell and will be nerfed later.
---
It's a prime example of the sunk cost fallacy in action on a massive scale.
---
whatever takes your fancy.
---
How do I know where the fucking fight is happening? Idk how many times I tried to play WvW and there is no obvious indication of where anyone is. The map says its full of people and I walk the border and see like one guy who kills me then refer to #1
---
Again, I'd love to have healthy dialogue with the community, but experience tends to show that it's not as simple as that.
---
This is a good suggestion. I was super let-down by the armor voucher. I don't understand people defending it and saying we could'v got nothing as compensation. To my knowledge, HoT was FULL PRICE until yesterday. It did not decrease in value until they arbitrarily decided to make it free.
---
Same here, friends bailing on GW2 everyday now, its amazing if they ignored PvE for 15-16 months the very people shouting about others to just leave the game, would be saying they are going too.
---
&gt; The vast majority of people giving criticism aren't attacking developers, but Anet's management of this game and their own developers. Anet has amazing devs who do a fantastic job but the management at Anet is absolutely shit. Multiple times I've heard from WvW and raid devs that they want, desperately, to actually do what people in the community want like repeatable CMs in raids or more difficult bosses but are handicapped by the decisions of the higher ups.
---
Can you provide proof? I'm not really buying this. There's usually more to these decisions than just that "good dev, bad management"-cliche. Mike Z strikes me as a good lad with a lot of passion for the game and its community!
---
Even if it's a minority attacking devs personally, there are still devs being verbally abused. A minority of 40.000 is plenty of folks. The devs have every right to speak up against that fraction of their player base publicly. It has nothing to do with "focusing on the worst part of the community". There's nothing "pathetic" in speaking up for oneself. 
---
Turns out their presentation was all about the new LWS and we all went into it expecting much more. That doesn't in any way mean there won't be any more raids. With the recent raid release (considering their 8-9 months release schedule...) they probably just didn't have anything tangible to show us. Although we certainly won't get new elite-specs with LWS5 which sucks... 
---
As for communication: In my opinion the PvP/WvW team does a decent job keeping us updated on their plans. Of course the competitive modes aren't the big focus and I'd love if development went much(!) faster. Waiting gets tedious. But their communication has been quite good for some time now. We just won't ever get a time frame beyond the usual soon^(TM).
---
I have no idea, but as long as you install the .NET framework (4.7 preferably) and set the game path properly, it *should* work. Fingers crossed!
---
i gave away some furniture to the red cross shop this week and didnt ask for a retweet.
---
I lersonally dont give much attention to anet's concept art, for how good it looks and all i dont feel it translares as faithfully in game.
---
Both look good to me for diff reason, one could be a deer thingy the other could be a charr and deer hybrid?
---
Im not e. they showed something which I thought was this and said a new world boss in episode 2?? I may be wrong tho. WIll have to rewatch the highlights.
---
I fancy elite specs.
---
Does the number of employees left match what an mmo needs to be on long term support?  I really don't know.
---
I think the idea they were trying to get across is that Bangar cucked Rytlock at some point.
---
Why not have multiple king of the hills going on at once? So if a zerg captures one point, they have to move?
---
It could be sorta like conquest, but without the towers, and maybe in a smaller arena.
---
They could also lower the player size within each arena. Such as splitting them into three maps instead of one, similar to how borderlands work.
---
&gt;I think the crux of the misunderstanding is that, from my perspective at least, you appear to be a pretty casual player. That doesn't mean uninvested, and it doesn't mean unskilled, and it doesn't mean you don't play a lot, but it does mean that you don't seem to focus on getting everything unlocked as soon as you can and grinding hardcore content like raids to be the best in game.
---
I achieved everything I achieved over the span of 2 and a half months that I’ve been back on GW2 from a fresh character that I didn’t boost to 80 or feed tomes (like I did to my alts after hitting 80) 
---
I’ve been playing through the raids and fractals as well.
---
If you don’t consider that hardcore then that right there is the problem with the so-called “hardcore” crowd of GW2. Anything beyond what I’ve done would actually be irresponsible, as even though I try to balance GW2, full time employ, and a social life, I still spend unhealthy amounts of time playing the game. To ask anything more than that would be to ask me to be a complete neet and do absolutely nothing but play GW2 24/7. 
---
I’ve been working on filling in my wardrobe, I’ve been working on obtaining more legendaries, and like I said, I’ve been working on my skyscale recently. 
---
My entire point is that GW2 has something to offer that MMOs are lacking in these days, a social environment. If you would prefer not to be social and/or to spend 100% of your game time in endgame raids, endlessly grinding for whatever the next best gear is that becomes obsolete in the next patch, you’ll feel right at home in WoW or FFXIV, but from what I’ve noticed, the majority of people who have hopped onto GW2 and are calling it home now, were particularly sick of burning out on tedious and substanceless endgame grinds and were looking for a game that had something more social to offer, where you can work on **long term goals** that feel meaningful. Which is something there’s no shortage of in GW2 and is apparently lacking these days in other MMOs.
---
no it wouldn't
---
Yeah, I understand. It's really hard to make that happen and dealing with gamers, who have a tendency to be fairly entitled, isn't really what you're paid for.
---
I am not a fan of warframe's game progression system and only play it casually. Really casual. Just notice that the game regularly adds new and sometimes bizarre things to keep things fresh. I watch DE streams even if I'm not playing warframe.
---
It’s like my friend told me, as soon as you give into the trolls just once, you’re screwed.  Nobody from any company should try to reason with people who are so toxic they make Hitler references or death threats.  It’s like arguing with a drunk.  You’re wasting your time.  Smile and walk away the best you can.
---
In the case over this event, I don’t know how the community could be anymore clear.  Unless you white knight the hell out of Anet, they don’t want to hear it.  However for some reason though, they feel the need to address the extremes like you mentioned though.  Why can’t they just admit their mistake or how they will be better in the future?  It’s beyond frustrating when you love a game so much that you’re playing it 7 years later and the devs look right over you.  It still doesn’t mean people need to make such shitty comments to the devs though.  Most of it is out of their control anyways.  It’s the higher ups who need to be at fault.
---
Must be difficult to be a Marketing Manager with all the current negative PR going around, i wouldn't want her job to be honest, sadly leadership way above her make her job nearly impossible in this game, and she has to find a spin to put on it, and just take all the flak, the devs as a whole do a great job with GW2, but someone higher on the pay scale is making life really hard for them, 
---
Let the DEVS talk to US, and let us know what is going on in the game we are supporting, clearly after 7 years with mostly silence you'd get that it doesn't work, and people are leaving this game and never coming back.
---
People get ignored for months on end, and eventually it boils up until it bursts, and the Sales pitch on Friday was that point for alot of people, yet instead or recognizing the problem, they try turn it on us, this is just pouring fuel onto an already blazing fire.
---
Couldnt that mean that other cutscenes they have in mind/in the works for this saga are nowhere near done?
---
I'm a bit active on the gw2 forums, but if I get banned for critiquing I'm going to be flabbergasted. This is why I mostly use reddit.
---
If you think I instasell you're probably also illiterate
---
If they pushed WvW in the same way they did PvE and only made WvW updates, people would be forced to try it and find ways to enjoy themselves.  Not everyone obviously but a lot more would.
---
I'm the opposite.  I'm a die hard WvW guy but I play PvE content because its new.  Its something fresh and I want to play GW2.  Nobody would be online to really play WvW with so I'd jump into the new LS and see what it was all about.  I also PvE'd a LOT for the first year or so and then on again/off again because I needed gold to help upgrade keeps (it used to cost gold to upgrade camps, towers, keeps, and SMC) and buy siege.
---
Its fine now though.  I've accepted WvW will never be a priority for them.  The fact that they only have two, maybe three developers on WvW shows how much they care about it.  Anything more by me is just setting myself up for disappointment and frustration.  To be clear too, if anyone thinks the alliance/restructure update will save WvW has no idea of all the other issues at hand.  That's why there's no hope.  The alliance update is only the tip of the iceberg of problems related to WvW.
---
Thanks but I’m not saying like the number you need to get, but what classes should be used in what bosses, unless I somehow have missed a part in the website where that is said
---
Honestly 1 &amp; 2 go hand in hand, people give valid criticism, and constructive feedback and they get ignored, this happens for months on end, sometimes years, then eventually it turns to anger and then into abuse towards the very people who asked for it to be constructive etc, ( Sure personal insults directly towards people who dont actually make the decisions is stupid )
---
Point 3, they have never done this, of when they do its been very little, i feel that after the mass layoffs, they where going to start talking more, but once the dust settled they realized they didn't have too, even now with all the bad PR this last couple of week, they still sit silent, the post on twitter is going to be turned around, because honestly like someone else said it feels like they are playing victim now.
---
Rubi has an impossible job with this one, shes the Content Marketing Manager, yet they arent allowed to talk about content, i think 18 months for the WvW Alliance system is taking abit to long, and to say we will talk in a few months just sent some people over the edge.
---
&gt; If you think GW2 PvP, WvW, and elite specs are getting stale and like  you need more, because that’s the content you like, I have some really  bad news for you, WoW PvP and classes are even worse and FFXIV PvP  barely exists, you’ll be waiting in queues for literal hours and the  action itself is pretty terrible. 
---
This is why we don't leave, because the combat and the action is amazing when it happens, but some of the mechanisms like matchmaking for both pvp and wvw, and the release cadence for raids, are atrocious. No other game has it all, and GW2 almost forces us to choose between awesome combat and gameplay but god awful everything else or meh combat with global cooldowns but at least there's challenging stuff to do that isn't frustrating or unfair.
---
Thank you
---
&gt; What I'm asking for is the TLDR of what the heck happened since I was gone
---
Tl;dr A lot of hardcore players don't feel like there's enough hardcore systems or love for the hardcore community, and a recent live event did nothing to help settle their concerns
---
&gt; and are the sentiments true of this game going the way of CoH and dying?
---
No, it's just not the best game right now for particular groups of players. If you're just returning (or effectively starting out), and if you're more into the casual side of things (doing hardcore content when it pleases you, but not making it your necessarily central focus), then there's still plenty for you to do and content updates are still coming
---
&gt;  Should I not even bother purchasing the expansions and just find another game to play, instead?
---
Since you haven't really touched either of the expansions, you still have a while before you really get caught up to the salty side of the community. And realistically, the only ones who really complain about the game are the ones who 
---
A) have been playing for quite a while and have exhausted their game mode
---
and
---
B) actually have something they want to complain about
---
The majority of us are still here, just quietly enjoying the game. I'm not discrediting their complaints of course, but it's not necessarily an indicator of all of us.
---
Oooh I am in love with this design, looking forward to the far Shiverpeaks themes.
---
Was there a purpose to this?  Were they protesting the fact that there is no dolyak mount on the horizon?  Or is this just one guy and all his alt accounts?
---
Devs are so out of touch they are living on another planet
---
Yeah, the Lunaro thing too. 🤣
---
Oh here we go again. This has become so common lately. Few idiots say something really bad and suddenly company gets to make sob story how people are so harash towards them and deflect or ignore all other valid criticism, feedback and concerns that vast majority of the community has. It's amazing how this became such easy escape route.
---
Questions on reddit about potential expansions? No. 
---
Questions on reddit about their favorite quaggan? Yes.
---
4.From like 4+ years ago, yes.  They want to fix other issues first though.  Tournaments were a huge mess no matter how they tried to address them.  Players joining for rewards not wearing the correct gear and getting killed which would rally the enemies already in a losing battle to further frustrate hardcore WvW players.  Massive queues and guilds stuck with less than half their rosters because of it was also a big issue.  There was also a big burnout after the season/tournament would end.  People would quit for months at a time and some never came back after.
---
Same shit that went on over at Apex Legends about 2 weeks ago... they felt like they didn't have to adress the actual issue that caused all this vile behaviour by 1% in the first place. We're not getting anywhere like this, if that's how they decide to shift the focus of the discussion away from actual issues these days.
---
&gt;I’m more of a casual player
---
Lol good lord
---
Yes you missed it. Click on the link above and you will see icons for every boss. Click those and you will get recommended squad comps.
---
Im sure it's a very interesting story beat in-game but the way you describe it makes it sound like an edgy 12 year old's short story.
---
🐝ing
---
Remember when that was posted and people though it was a great step? Yeah no communication was bad then and it is worse now
---
&gt;People have discovered that if you put it out there that you're receiving death threats, even if you aren't, then more people will respond with sympathy rather than criticism.
---
the people that still continue to criticise in this situation are often chastised for thinking logically while everyone else is having an emotional response. it happened during the layoffs.
---
oh good, it's another one of these. "some people were huge assholes that told us to go die or w/e, therefor we can ignore all the legitimate criticism by just painting everyone as one of those"
---
Stop.
---
Cloud storage isn't free and uncompressed video is big, *very big*.

The newest trailer is 1920x1080 pixels, has 30fps and is 2:23 = 143s long.  
---
`1920 * 1080 * 12bit * 30 * 143 = 12.42GiB` (assuming 4:2:0 chroma subsampling, twice as much for 4:4:4 because you have 24bit/pixel instead of 12bpp)
---
They could make it a torrent though.
---
If they had something to show they would’ve shown it. Either during the presentation yesterday or the convention a dev mentioned in the coming week that I forgot the name of.
---
Bingo.  I was looking for anything that makes me want to reinstall...but nope, just the same ole same ole.  It's pretty depressing...the game has insane long term potential :(
---
&gt;  the story has gotten (or is gonna be) a lot more dark and gritty is actually a pleasant surprise,
---
The thing is, gw2's writing has been going downhill for a long time now. I wouldn't put any eggs in the "story" basket.
---
Revenue is definitely not the issue. If anything they'd make less money with a sub and dlcs. Few games use a sub for this reason. Most players don't even want to deal with a sub. They are, however, seriously milking the gem store and the selling of physical products.
---
It's perceived that way in most mmos tbh
---
There would also be more PvP players if you could play with friends more often than 5 times a day for maybe half an hour. Swiss and on demand tournamens are in the work for ages. It was suicide to limit PvP to duoque without having anything ready for groups. It took over a year to implement a suboptimal game mode for teams. By then all my PvP friends left the game to play something else or switched to raids. None will ever come back and now the class balance is non existent anyway.
---
&gt;Toxic raids
---
*Sigh*
---
There's a few ways you can know what's going on actually.
---
1. Ask in Map Chat or Team Chat. Easy.
---
2. Look for Orange Swords. These babies say that "hey there is at least 25 people in combat in this area".
---
3. Look for White Swords. When things get white swords they are contested. When this happens there's a 95% chance that it was an enemy.
---
4. Look for objectives on RI (Righteous Indignation). Objectives on RI mean that they were "capped" recently and is usually a good indicator of a group.
---
5. Look for groups with similar name tags, they're usually a guild group. Kind of controversial (and hard) to follow an untagged commander but sometimes it's necessary to keep yourself from going crazy out of boredom.
---
6. Wait in Garrison or SMC. Kind of boring, but groups tend to come and go through these areas a lot and use these areas to form up squads.
---
Final Tip: Add Comanders to your friends list. You can see what map they're on and it's sometimes a good indicator they might tag up soon if they're not already.
---
&gt;If you want to show them who's boss
---
they don't. they want to *use* them as an excuse to ignore the legitimate criticism.
---
I guess I’m bummed on there not being a actual of what’s to come. It’s all hyped up. To almost nothing. I have so much unlocked in game. And a guild hall with 20,000 decorations I can’t use. Have to be specific. 
---
So many friends have moved on. There’s nothing I can look forward too. Just random maybe kinda sorta hints or false promises. Promises that are taking years to follow through. Guild wars 2 combat system is still my favorite. I WISH it to be pushing more content. More things that take time and fun too do. 
---
But it seems I’m at a loss. I’ll still keep looking for something. But continue to play other things in the mean time.
---
Gosh, I hope he's around for a while. I just love how he's baiting Rytlock. I love him and I hate him, please keep him like this the entire time. 
---
Here have a drawing I did of him &lt;3 https://imgur.com/eONwwha
---
Ep 1 and 2 are only free for a limited time. Prologue will probably be free forever, as a teaser to get people to buy episodes later down the line.
---
Well NCSoft certainly is :P
---
Instead of addressing the valid concerns they went ahead and focused on the extreme minority. If this is the direction the company is going for, they deserve every bit of downfall that's to come. I kept hoping that they'd come around but no, just as secretive about the game's future as ever. Sadly this is it for me. Was fun while it lasted.
---
Yes if Anet can show the saga concept can do what expansions can. I believe it can but they need to tell us it can and show us.
---
As people negativity affects us and sticks with us more than positive.  Ive seen many youtubers say they would see a sea of positive comments and one nasty comment brings them down.  At the same time you do need to filter out the signal from the noise.  There are definitely constructive and positive feedback in there with the angry and mad.  I feel like Anet felt burned by HoTs so there solution was to do the opposite and release things with no real marketing and hope for the best.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bowl_of_Fruit_Salad_with_Mint_Garnish
---
Any of the ascended recipes that involve mint increase outgoing healing by 10%. This one seems best to me, but I don’t play a healer much.
---
Remember when the Anet mods chased away a large chunk of the WvW community from the forums and then kept it away by mostly ignoring them and banning any thread where a competitive spirit is displayed about a competitive game mode?
---
but than its also toxic for being that one guy who only half ass it, while everyone else is trying their best. If the build is not helping the group, than should you not try to adapt or change the way you play in order for you and everyone else to success? is that not a personal responsibility of a person when they are joining a group?
---
I always say that Season 2 was the golden age.. We got just enough content to occupy that 2 week release schedule without anyone yelling about a content drought. We still got new maps. The world around us actually felt alive, like when we could visibly keep track of Mordremoth's spreading corruption, and how the reddit lit up every few days about new vines being discovered in new places. Overall, the story pacing was better as well. We got just enough story to satisfy that moment, and the small breaks actually made some sense, and weren't too drawn out between.  
---
It felt like there was actually cohesive content at a steady pacing. S1 was a clustered mess, but it did give us a lot to do as well, but S2 is where I felt the game shined the most. With S3 and S4 taking HUGE breaks between releases, the game felt very dry and dull between.. when we got any current events, they were never anything to tie over the time, but more of just a few achievements to finish up and then pass by any of the related events when they pop up again.
---
The sound of punch two and three happen way before the impact.
---
I have but haven't been able to find this fast-paced combat you speak of.
---
It's not awful but, like I say, the introductory experience sucks.
---
For someone who raids regularly in GW2, even the end-game rotations in FF14 look very slow and basic.
---
Well I told you guys. ArenaNet. Left wing, victim mentality, emotional and irrational. 
---
But you can't change people. It is what it is. I am still enjoying the game.
---
Because it's an easy way out. 
---
Say you got mean comments and how it's why you communicate so little.
---
People feel bad.
---
Topic shifted, you don't have to address any other concerns.
---
If by "Leagues" the op means seasons, Anet has answered that one before. They stated there are no plans to do another WvW season, as the player base shrank after the completion of each of the ones they did run. Basically, seasons burn the player base out.
---
Sick... I like confident Rytlock
---
I am not kidding, please link an example of what you consider an abusive post so I can understand what you're talking about. I took the time to look through every comment in this thread just to be sure. There were some stupid posts, absolutely. There was *one* rager with the "she's calling us all Hitler" take (downvoted to -17). There was *one* typical moron calling anet "snowflakes". The absolute WORST thing I saw in the entire thread was someone saying "she annoys me". That's an unhelpful, mean, and directly targeted comment. I'd say that probably fits the definition of "abuse" even though it's some incredibly milquetoast bullshit.
---
haha I am so smart I sniff glue uurr
---
cya idiot
---
When you get into a squad,  ask if there's a teamspeak or discord channel.   It helps a lot knowing what's going to happen and where you're going.  Squad commanders will tell you when to pull back, when to push, etc.  
---
Wvw generally requires a different build than pve.  When new, don't worry about doing a lot of damage,  worry about staying alive.   As you get the hang of it, you can go glass if you're dps, but when you're new, it'll be overwhelming.  Wvw relies heavily on damage mitigation, dodging and not being in the wrong spot at the wrong time. 
---
If you can, join a wvw oriented guild.  Most of them are very nice and many will have training sessions. Again,  the combat is very different than pve,  so there's different skills to learn. 
---
Realize you will die.  Sometimes you're overwhelmed by 2x your numbers, but an even fight after you have experience can be a lot of fun. But, even then, you will die.  You can die in half a second in wvw sometimes.  It happens to everyone.  With experience,  you can reduce the frequency of that, but it will happen, especially if you're dps.
---
How are we still saying raids are unpopular when we had 17k viewers for the erp? If they actually supported the mode it would garner tons of attention.
---
Sadly I've seen many game devs do this when shit hits the fan :/
---
I'm a jackass because I do research instead of making baseless accusations?
---
Yes, they're adding HoT directly to PoF, which includes unredeemed codes from official and officially licensed 3rd party sellers (like DLGamer for example, which usually has permanent discounts compared to buying directly from ANet. Just dont use G2A or Kinguin). If in case you *didnt* get HoT bundled after redeeming a new PoF key, you can just submit a ticket along with proof of purchase (like the CD Key you get to redeem the expac or a screenshot of the digital receipt) and see if they can add it in for you.
---
I kinda like the new design better tbh. Tho tbf I never played GW1. The new design looks really alien and weird, it'd be great if they used it for something other than an already established character.
---
And they probably changed the design of Primordus because the Primo in LW3 is frickin massive. From what I've seen, Primordus in GW1 was a lot smaller.
---
Nope! sorry.. No excuses.
---
yeah, i just realized that Mike Z knew exactly how little he was giving us
---
I'll preface this by saying I'm a developer myself, not gamedev, but software dev nonetheless (R&amp;D Firmware dev). I introduce to you, one of [Destiny 2's roadmaps](https://destinynewshub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/destiny-2-forsaken-dlc-roadmap.jpg). Notice how there are no exact dates? Notice how there's no super in depth info of the features? That's because, as you said, specifics get ironed out in development. A general roadmap, however, is absolutely something ANY SOFTWARE COMPANY should be able to do. These roadmaps are the product of Destiny 2's bad release and the massive community outcry about the state of the game and lack of communication.
---
If a company can't consistently reach the vast majority of milestones in a GENERAL roadmap, the company is having very bad management issues.  If a company is unable to produce a roadmap for their clients, the company is having very bad management issues.
---
I know what you mean man. I've been doing 10-11 hour days. To add to that I commute by bike to work and it takes me around 30 minutes to get home-I'm exhausted from work and from the pedaling but I was never trying to be "relevant" in any game I played. I'm always playing at my own pace. Thats why with my schedule I really look forward to playing a game for the story only. I'm excited for the one with jormag. I was always interested in that part of tyria but I was expecting some hint of going overseas to Cantha. Never played GW but when I heard about the city from some of my guildies I really looked forward and hoped that GW2 will be getting Cantha at some point.
---
Horizontal progression only really works when there is a constant influx of new features and rewards.  
---
This is not what ANet has been doing.
---
It's actually a thing many raiders, casuals and "casual-raider hybrids"(those who want start raiding) asked for since W1. So I think the answer is yes.
---
3 years ago, it was said no more hype because of community backlash from the game director.  The crowd forced them to withdraw and they still demand to be told private company plans.  
---
TLDR: Entitled players ruined the communication.
---
Or maybe were getting 1 map that has 2 or more episodes in it
---
It is our business when we purchased all the upcoming content as part of Path of Fire.  We're their customers and entitled to knowledge about the product we purchased, not just some strangers wanting customer secrets.  What I want is something closer to Paradox Interactive's dev diaries, telling us what's going well, what isn't and might get scrapped, keeping everything down to earth and realistic.  The story beats can be a surprise, but the rest of the game absolutely should not be surprising.
---
Every 2 weeks release is not sustainable and resulted in a 9 month content drought leading up to HoT, at least thats how i remembered it
---
Most accurate response I've seen in months - have a thumbs up.
---
Honestly I still think it's all on management. Rubi in her role and any of the devs do not have the clearance to address the concerns until someone above them gives them the green light.
---
So let's assume the comments directed at her and the devs are as frequent and horrible as they say: the only thing they can do is try and get people to calm down without the ability to say the things that actually would (even just acknowledging the criticism). Meanwhile, they're being attacked. They don't have any option but address the worst of the worst. That's not a problem caused by Rubi, that comes solely by the people above her.
---
&gt;Freedom of speech only applies to the government.
---
Underscoring this. A private company owes one no freedom of speech.
---
&gt; Do you guys think we'll ever see that level of hype again? That level of excitement for the game again?
---
If we get another, similar leak, yes. But I don't think that's the way to go.
---
My experience on NA is that if you're doing fractal CMs at reset you'll basically always get a group straight away. Off hours can be a LONG ass wait, like 1 hour+
---
Non-CM T4 fractal groups are much easier to find, generally low wait time.
---
That sounds so much better honestly. For how great the LS3 and 4 maps have looked, there usually isn't much reason to go back to them. Having six or so episodes with three maps that are great would be better than having six maps that only look great. And the prospect of some older maps getting attention also sounds really nice.
---
If this is what they're doing, its good that they're actually listening to the community, as this is something that has been suggested a lot around here.
---
I agree. I'm not trying to apologize for ANet or defend everything they do.
---
I'm personally of the opinion that PvP and WvW are a waste of time in an MMORPG, and I say that generally about all MMORPGs because I haven't seen one where the PvP community is successful in perpetuity. And now we're 7 years into GW2. I always assumed PvP and WvW would've been ghost towns years ago.
---
But I still agree with you because that's not ANet's stance on PvP and WvW. They've spent a lot of effort (despite what this community currently says) on PvP and WvW. ANet *SHOULD* be giving personalized stages to PvP and WvW, because it was their decision to spend effort on them.
---
But if that's the case then I wouldn't want them spoiling PvP's or WvW's chance to shine by lumping them in with a Living World sneak-peek preview. Which is what they said Aug 30 would be all along.
---
Yeah if your zerg is steamrolling the other server with no resistance, if not then you are better off capping camps/sentrys solo or small group.
---
Because if there's no answer, popping in the thread to say it will only anger people.
---
whoa hold up there now as i black man im down for the thicc, but whats your defintion of "plus size"
---
&gt; why is hardcore raid = toxic raid here?
---
Ever tried to get a raid Dhuum CM raid group via lfg(EU)? Then you know the reason. :)
---
If ANet isn't just going to let new players have a Warclaw, they should at least have a "Rent-a-Warclaw" NPC at every waypoint area of WvW and make it free or incredibly cheap to rent one. Renting a Warclaw can give the player a 15 minute "just-let-this-player-use-Warclaw" buff to at least catch up to the action.
---
Hey you said it not me
---
&gt; MP for Clydesdale north
---
I thought she was from Flydale North.
---
I've played board games and D&amp;D with Anet devs, they're definitely capable of being gaming buds.  Frankly it's Mo and top leadership that feels so awkward to me.  Unfortunately the regular devs/designers/QAs/etc don't get to decide how the company as a whole behaves.
---
I cannot honestly comprehend why anyone plays WvW or what fun it possibly can be. I've done it a fair amount to crank out reward tracks for things I wanted, but it seems to me just to be the exact same thing over and over and over again. Just different teams capturing the same map keeps over and over. I don't understand why it's fun, or how it holds anyone's attention. 
---
Granted, I don't get PvP either, but at least I understand that a bit more on a one-vs-one level, really testing how well your build is against other players. WvW just seems so boring, following a zerg all around a map until you have everything captured or a bigger zerg takes yours.... then rinse and repeat. I see literally no sense of pride of accomplishment with it. Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but I just can't even begin to see how it's fun to do, especially over all the actual unique and interesting content in PvE.
---
The community attached to hardcore raiding is toxic
---
&gt;The gw2 Reddit discord is a bit shit too.
---
could you elaborate?
---
&gt;I just want... another game mode. Something that still contributes to the mist war, but with a different goal than large-scale conquest.
---
Yes something with targets for big groups but also effective small group targets.
---
I honestly don't know why they don't rework some of the old living story season instances into fractals. They did it before with Tower of Nightmares. There are so many unused properties they could be making fractals out of. I mean, even that entire half map of istan is useless outside of the one story instance you do. There is o much effort being put into maps and properties that are only ever used ONCE. They doesn't make sense at all.
---
Yeah. It can definitely risk your career. And a *dialogue* isn't strictly necessary.
---
The issue I have with the way ANet does things is that they seem to shut out thoughtful criticism along with the bullshit. And I got this impression from some comments made by former devs. One of them commented on the negativity towards the communication policy awhile back - the player base doesn't have a degree in communications. Are they really qualified to assess and evaluate that? Writers said similar stuff. Are you a writer?
---
But a person doesn't need to be a professional to have good ideas. Hell, most of the game devs I know don't have formal training in game design. They just played a lot of games, had good ideas, and knew how to communicate their ideas well.
---
I think the criticism of their communication policy is one of the better examples of this.
---
Maybe you know more about it since you're in the industry, but it seems to me like more and more studios are getting a frontman to handle issues transparently. Where big studios used to quietly twiddle their thumbs while game breaking bugs had the community foaming out the mouth, now most of the studios I follow have somebody that will openly discuss the issue, and even get technical, describing what's going on in the code and why tackling the issue is more or less challenging. Xienen of Evil Mojo, the studio that produces Paladins, is a good example of this sort of figure.
---
What I'm trying to say is that I get the sense that, from the limited interactions I've observed of present and former staff, there's the perception that players themselves are unqualified to even critique the game. And in that situation, one can't have the next best thing to a dialogue - listening to the members of the community who are thoughtful and do offer useful insight.
---
I could easily be wrong. I don't know what's going on inside ANet. But it's the feeling that I get from listening in.
---
Thanks /u/Whilyam
---
        
---
       
---
This thread accomplished what it was intended to do. Now like I said, you and your friends at Anet need to do a better job at giving us vague leaks of upcoming content to keep the community hyped up.
---
Episode two will also have drakkar as a worldboss. He doesn't have to be directly near drakkar lake but I would by highly surprised if he is far from it's "home".
---
Call it what you will, but that is *literally* the TL;DR that OP asked for. It's not a matter of opinion; the game modes I listed above are losing players due to lack of attention. Whether or not you give a shit is a separate matter entirely.
---
Then it wouldn't hurt to have an even easier version for people who don't find the current version easy enough.
---
funny how my wording does the exact same thing her tweet does.
---
But Funco Pops and weird leggings!
---
I also suspect the sinking ship is in Janthir Bay. If you assume something in Janthir Bay and the Far Shiverpeaks (like, try to imagine PoF-size maps or even LS4 size maps being there), then the area actually fills in really quickly since Bastion of the Penitent takes up a good chunk of space.
---
&gt;Why should you achieve the same rewards as someone who completes harder content than you?
---
Why not? 
---
&gt;There are 1000s of rewards in the game, you can live without a few skins if you don't think they're worth the effort
---
Sure, but if the ones someone wants are locked behind raids, then what's the benefit of that to the players who don't raid?
---
[my black metal fan sylvari is sad](https://imgur.com/kyLrvun)
---
That ANet is more interested in antagonizing the entire community than actually addressing any of the complaints really shows a lot of their character.
---
Yeah I think people blame poor performance on their PC when it is the game. I can run any modern game maxed (without RTX), but GW2 chugs
---
You don't think ressurecting and superpowering aurene and undoing the climax and lesson of an entire episode in the most predictable way possible that was so predictable people people were actually in disbelief when it happened because they thought anet was above it is bad writing?
---
It literally means (in)voluntary (cel)ibate.
---
Never really had a problem finding a group for fractals. Raids might be hit or miss finding a specific wing/encounter and most of the time you'll get shitty raidsellers instead of honest groups.
---
There very definitely are devs that play. I see them in game occasionally doing trains or meta events.
---
Took you long enough.
---
see, *this* is proof that nobody can even recognize what these exactly are...
---
I'm not even angry about that, I'm just confused.
---
Joko has more personality than 99% of characters anet has been "developing" for 7 years, he has a long history, an intresting personality and players new and old loved him.
---
I mean fuck it, I'd trade taimi for joko as a permenant companion, at least he is more intresting and has a fucking personallity that extends beyond "uwu so cute uwu"
---
Nah I don't think a lot of people will be happy about an ls announcemet. Would people be as vocal if it would have been a blogpost? Certainly not but there would be still cointless disappointed people asking when actual content (elite specs, raids etc.) is comming.
---
You still would have had to buy PoF to play the new content even if they didn't start giving away HoT for free.  Your entire argument is based on emotions and false premises.
---
&gt; The game was outstanding at launch,
---
That's not true. That's a blatant rose-tinted-glasses lie to yourself and everyone around you.
---
It was good, it was fresh and different, but it wasn't outstanding. 
---
* On certain slops/stairs, you could trigger falling damage, repeatedly, and kill yourself for walking down stairs too fast. Who else remembers that bullshit? It was ages before they finally fixed it. :D
---
* Most maps lessened in activity because everyone converged on Queensdale champ train for many months.
---
* For dungeons, whoever started the instance could be super-toxic and threaten to leave the instance to collapse the whole thing for everyone else. Let's not even get started about the Waypoint running and all the bugs...
---
* Dungeon Tokens went in your inventory - And it took so many years for us to get the wallet feature.
---
* The Orrian maps were interesting in concept but even now most people shy away from going there except for specific farms.
---
* Zhaitan was a UNIVERSAL DISAPPOINTMENT
---
* ANet tried so hard to make PvP eSports a thing and that was a massive flop
---
* The friends list is actually a follower system, that doesn't keep blocked-players out of your party or from following you... And over 6 years hasn't been improved once.
---
* There is still no way official way to advertise/search for guilds in-game that doesn't involve puking a fat block of text in map chat.
---
I could go on, but I think I touched on the broad gist of it. 
---
Guild Wars 2 is just "good." It's just "pretty okay," and that's tragic.
---
It's a summoning circle. What they are summoning though is a heavily guarded secret.
---
You'll never find someone who puts women on a higher pedastel than an incel.
---
This is a herd, you idiot
---
Joko in the single instance he appeared in had more personality and "character" than 99% of the actual characters anet has been "developing" for 7 years, ontop of that he has a long history, a fun attitude, a unique flavour and players new and old loved him.
---
Honestly, i have not played this game since early last year after PoF came out and was on its way to the next round of LW content, and after seeing the community outcry and it all just falling on deaf ears with the devs playing the Victims of the toxic minority, time and time again, I'm glad i haven't spent any more money on this game. I've found a much better game in FFXIV and yeah i might have to pay $12/month but at least i feel like I'm getting my money's worth. Regular content updates, proper community communication (look at the FFXIV live letters and tell me ANet couldn't do the same!), and a sense of progression are what i look for in an MMORPG. I started playing GW back in 2006 and i loved the story and continued playing through GW2 ignoring the glaring flaws with the game design because i loved the story. I think i am finally done, ANet either has no idea what direction it wants to take this game, or it simply does not care what happens to it and frankly its not worth it. I hope those of you that enjoy this game continue to enjoy it and ANet does fix the issues, but I'm uninstalling and leaving the subreddits for this game as i can't stand watching the community just get jerked around anymore!
---
I hope Bangar doesn't turn evil so he can be eveyrone's daddy.
---
I prefer by content to be thicc
---
And suddenly, I feel no remorse or pity for someone like her being fired.
---
&gt; The entire community is at rage
---
That's wrong. It's only this reddit sub that rage. And people here raging for almost every reason. 95% of the playerbase don't use reddit or other forums, but especially here some people think this subreddit includes the whole community. 
---
It's definitely *not* the entire community.
---
&gt; The Twitter this morning, a dev yelled at one or two players for ‘insulting the devs’, which, to my eyes, is also a sign to all potential criticism saying that ‘we are working hard already, you have no right to criticize me’.
---
She didn't "yelled" at all, she criticized all the hates and insults against devs and *yes*, there *were* many really bad insults. She didn't say anything against criticism at all, she talked about all the insults and she did in a polite and professional way. I agree, it shouldn't necessary to makes these tweets, because what she criticizes was what everyone should have learned in the age between 3 and 12. Starting with the way how to talk with and about people. It really is a shame that this kind of tweet *was* necessary in the end.
---
If you feel addressed by these tweets, you really should think about what kind of "criticism" you wrote.
---
I honestly am not sure whether I find that hard to believe, because even fucking Neverwinter has a PTR and barely anyone plays that game
---
They explicitly described in the announcement that the map from ep 1 will expand for ep 2, so yeah.
---
First thing first, they need to rebalance the classes.
---
It's very hard for pug newcomer to learn cuz spam fest.
---
Mostly zerg fights only last like 5 sec.
---
Nerf AoE please, make fights interesting again.
---
Increase rewards.
---
Oh, I can answer that: Because there was a pre hot and a post hot era. Pre hot meant: Hot was announced and than ... 10 months nothing till the release. After that hot was released and than ... another nine month where next to nothing was released until s3 started. There were of cause three raids and a huge rework of hot zones, but the raids were technically part of the expansion development and the aprils patch six months after release made hot to what is perceived as "good expansions" today. Before that it was a pleasure for friends of long investment but if you are one of those who only wanted to jump in and have a little fun for 30 minutes you were screwed most of the time. Original hot maps had to be played in two hour cycles (or wierdly afk-ed once you were through one cycle) while dragon stand was technically one of the shortest commitment with a decent group (now it is the longest).
---
Ppl are upset about a three to four month gap between patches Imagine a 15 month period without not knowing what will be next ... because some of us already were there and not everyone got through this time.
---
I don't see many folks directing their ire at individual devs. We're frustrated at a company. Arenanet is not a person. Anet is not capable of emotion. It is a a company. Their employees cannot validly play the victim here. Anet fucked up again, and Anet has to bear the brunt of the criticism levelled at it, as a company.
---
If anybody is levelling abuse at individuals they are in the wrong to so. Presentations, release schedules, promotions... these are all higher level company decisions that entire teams are involved in, and worthy of debate and criticism.
---
Arenanet is not a person. It is not your friend. You do not owe it anything. It is a company. It is perfectly healthy to criticise a company. It is not okay to hurl abuse at a person. I haven't seen any of the latter happening.
---
than there must be a reason why that get call out, either dps doing less and the support or the support not giving the boons that the group needed, or a mechanics in the raid fail. And its as you said, you don't need perfect rotations or play the right class as long as you are on par with everyone else. 
---
that said, i know there are toxic group that would kick you because of your classes or foods you using, that happen in every game - every community.
---
and lastly on your casual/newbies example, in that situation you have a certain expectation from people, therefore the experiences is fairly present for you and everyone else in your group. But now imagine you and your group are looking to get the clear done (its the only time you and your team can play together), so you lfg for experiences raider to do the clear (for less painful experiences) but some newbies join the group instead would you not call them out on that? same thing is apply for lfg, everyone that join will expected a certain amount of experiences base on the lfg, and that can work out if everyone can actually walk the talk, but if not than someone in the group is lying, therefore should get call out (better yet, the person should know if they mess up and lets the team know that they are clearly not ready for the raid yet, and leave the group instead of getting call out).
---
There was a lot of hype built up, but it turned out to be a standard Living World announcement.  Not terrible stuff, but lots of disappointment that there wasn't something more.  The game is years away from dying based on current earnings, and there are plenty of players running around in-game, but you've definitely visited here at a low point.
---
Now that HoT is free when you buy PoF, [$20 is an insanely good value](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43807) for the hundreds of hours worth of content and [features added the last four years](https://i.imgur.com/s71sJc3.png).  If you're looking for a good game, there is plenty of it here.
---
TL:DR: HoT released and was very difficult content. Players complained and ANet made it easier. There was a long spell of no content then Season 3 hit and it was almost all really good (except for Siren's Landing, that was filler crap). Then Path of Fire hit and people loved mounts but complained that the metas weren't rewarding/they didn't know there were metas so ANet  added some better rewards. Season 4 came out and was phenomenal with no episode that sticks out to me as a dud. Unfortunately, during this time ANet had been siphoning talent off Guild Wars to work on unknown projects and those failed to get off the ground so those projects were cancelled and a bunch of ANet devs were laid off. After Season 4 concluded, ANet teased that they wanted to do more with Living World than what they did with seasons and allow themselves to do different things like work on old maps or try new things instead of being bound to a 1 episode = 1 new map release cadence. They teased again that they'd have a big reveal of the next chapter of Living World on Friday and... they majorly dropped the ball. It was mostly confirmations of things we already knew they were working on and/or could assume that they're close to since they have been burning through a list of changes they posted shortly after the layoffs. PvE story players are basically the only players who are happy with what was teased. PvP/WvW players feel they weren't given anything tangible. Raiders/Fractalers got no news. Players interested in extreme high-difficulty content have also gotten nothing of substance. And then there was some creepy-ass motherfucker in hobo rags that came out and shilled crap merchandise.
---
Now, as for you. I think you would be absolutely insane to think the game is dying. The game has had what it's always had: a developer who is crap at communicating. The content is 1000% worth the money, particularly now because you buy Path of fire and you also get HoT. Also, if you log in before the 17th, I believe you'll still get the most recent Season 4 episode "War Eternal" for free, thus letting you not be too far out of the loop of the story as well as getting access to one of the absolute best pieces of content this game has to offer. I think even the most jaded veterans would tell you that the game is worth the money. Even if we go to bizarro land and the game ceases active development without the new "Saga" being published, $30 is still a steal for two expansions worth of content. If you actively engage with all the content, you seriously have literal years of playtime to catch up to veterans who have been playing consistently. As in 24/7/365, don't bathe, don't eat, die of deep vein thrombosis years.
---
Technically I think they are all that way (except maybe kralk?) but it was easier to say he
---
That just mean you don't belong in that group.
---
Glad we could work through that.
---
Yeah, I have an i9 and the game still has issues when there are too many players on screen. The only actual fix is to lower player model count but that's kinda the entire point of zerg fights is to see your enemies not just floating nametags.
---
That's what I got the impression it is, since I think Zhaitan is occasionally referred to as "he", but I really like that we're looking back at that. I want the dragons to have mystery, not have people asking "where do dragon babies come from?" "Well when a mommy dragon and a daddy ddragon love each other very much..." It's just entirely uninteresting to me. That should be beyond our ability to understand.
---
Well sense ANet said living world take the place of expansions. It was sorta like revealing an expansion.
---
Oh wow! Thank you! I’ll be sure to share this with the team next week!
---
Im 100% a pve player, tried wvw once and had no idea what to do and left.
---
The Gem Store doesn't sell the expanions for gems, only the [deluxe edition upgrades](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2:_Path_of_Fire#Purchasing). These are meant for people who bought the expansion's standard edition but want the items that come with the deluxe edition.
---
Nah. 
---
The problem with WvW is that it's like super boring PvE, but with occasional PvP stuff in it. Most PvE players don't want either of those things, so they will continue to stick to PvE.
---
I already have both expansions, so it's weird that it would show up in the store for me, but all I know is that it was a higher gem price and it was currently marked down (as of last night or this morning) for a fraction of that.
---
Ohhh I see. Thanks for the info!
---
 11 Million accounts, 1.5 million players a day
---
I wish Warhammer: Online was still around. Their RvR system was pretty top notch. Sure, like anything, it had its issues, but even smaller scaled teams could contribute to the whole server war by playing in arena matches. 
---
Heck, even GW1 had HoH which gave your country of origin access to the UW and FoW, but Anet seems to be too scared to implement anything to do with skill based play. I haven't felt a sense of contribution since before the megaservers.
---
Especially when they were Kul Tiran druids
---
Hey, I was referenced! :D
---
You can buy the deluxe upgrades in the gem store. That would give you all of the bonus items that came with those versions of the expansion, but you can't purchase the actual expansion with gems. F2P players also can't convert gold to gems.
---
We were so sure they wouldn't do it because it was so obvious that it just had to be be a red herring, and then they did it anyway. SubVErSion oF ExpeCtATiOnS.
---
Agreed. Purple diamond = aggro is a great way to prep people for...well...anything. Combined with recent (over the couple years) of many AoE circles becoming easier to see and mechanics being well-telegraphed is bringing up the quality of new players much better than what we had before.
---
I played fractals with mastery rank ~10s today who were new to fractals and it was sooooooo much easier than doing the same thing years ago. I spent far less time explaining things and far fewer resets than usual. Some groups are better than others but this is really a 'monkey see, monkey do' kind of thing. When I got the purple diamond they saw me disengage a bit and behave a certain way. So when they got the diamond the emulated that behavior.
---
Of course in an experienced group the 'disengage' part would have been a waste. You just stack blind, aegis, dodge at the right time, etc but for teaching new players it worked better than typing out 5 lines of text in chat.
---
[removed]
---
I have the original art book from back when the game released but given the current state of things, I can't be too upset about this. I'm more concerned about the game itself surviving in a reasonable state
---
Exactly, this is why the Warframe devs are so loved, they put all the cards on the table and are honest with the community. If something takes longer they are communicating that, not to mention how they also have the mentality of "interacting with the community in as many ways as possible is positive" the way arenanet is headed it's getting closer and closer to activision blizzards "we have to stay quiet and only communicate with the players after holding huge meetings to discuss what we can say or what might be controversial" meanwhile DE (warframe devs) sit there in a community livestream weekly bursting out jojo memes, interacting, looking at fan art and making kinky jokes.
---
I know I repeated myself but I just feel very strongly about this because I really don't want more devs who I thought positive off to go in the direction of complete radio silence and not addressing the community in any way except "look quaggan cute lol"
---
Why not use the dungeon system that already exists and actually fill out content that has been missing for 7 years but NOPE here's strike missions^tm
---
The hood would just make you bald anyway.
---
He's implied to kill more than one to rise through the ranks after he had been demoted to scrapper status due to dereliction of duty (in regard to leaving his assigned Iron Legion group in Ascalon for a little side tour of slaying dragon champions and taking a shot at Kralkatorrik itself). From the end of *Edge of Destiny* after he returns from the disastrous battle in the Crystal Desert:
---
&gt; When first he returned to the Blood Legion, he was stripped of rank and assigned menial work. An overseer called him a traitor, and Rytlock killed him. That's how he became an overseer. Later, a legionnaire called him a deserter, and Rytlock killed him as well. That's how he became a legionnaire.  
---
&gt; Let a centurion call him a friend to humans, and Rytlock would rise again.  
---
&gt; He was no longer a friend to humans, especially not to Logan Thackeray.  
---
&gt; Rytlock spit from the top of the wall and watched the gobbet fall a hundred feet down before smearing.  
---
&gt; Logan, who was now Queen Jennah's lapdog...  
---
&gt; Logan, who had corrupted a dungeon full of charr...  
---
&gt; Logan, who had made a fool out of Rytlock...  
---
&gt; "He'd better hope the Seraph never fight the Blood Legion."
---
I'm just saying what i think the reasoning is, not that I agree with it.
---
If they make them in parallel with raids I'm fine with it. The issue is that they a) might decide to abandon raids entirely. b) drop the support for strike missions if they aren't as popular as they expected. Adding to the long list of things they have abandoned.
---
I don't think you understand how facts and evidence work. All information is only probabilistically true. You can never be 100% certain about anything. You can be so certain about something that it's so close to 100% that you might as well treat it like it were 100%. And that's basically what we mean by facts. It's a fact that the sun came up this morning because the certainty of that fact is like 99.99(like 30 more 9's)%. 
---
Probable doesn't mean "it most likely happened, we just don't have concrete evidence", it means it has a greater than 50% chance to be true. It mean it's more likely than not to be true. Without any concrete evidence, in order to say that there were paid audience members in this particular instance, you would need to look at base rates of paid audience members across as many and as recent other live game announcements. If of the last 40 announcements, only 10 of them were shown to have paid audience members, then the base rate would be 25%. In which case it would be a good estimate to say that this one has a 25% chance of having paid audience members, and thus it wouldn't be accurate to say "probably", it would be "probably not" since it's less like to be true than false.
---
Now, if there was a single piece of evidence, like, say one person came forward and said they were paid to be there and cheer. That might bring us up to like 90% chance. And then it would be "probably" true. But to bring it up to a fact, we'd need more than just one witness's word. We'd need some physical evidence like contracts, pay stubs, or job listings for it, or some kind of corroboration like more paid audience members coming forward or ANet admitting to doing it. Then we might get to 99% with a few more trailing 9's.
---
It's just like accusations and courts. If you take a random person on a street, it's plausible that they could be a murderer. There are lots of murders that happen. But most people aren't murderers, so it's not "probable" that a random person just happens to be a murderer. But then, if you heard that that random person got arrested for murder, then it becomes probable that they're a murderer since most people arrested for murder turn out to be murderers. But it's not until some one gets convicted of murder that it becomes a fact. But even then, that's not a 100% certainty since there are still the occasional wrongful convictions.
---
Yeah, I did that but I thought I should ask anyway just in case.
---
The last two episodes have been increeeedible for story and cutscenes.
---
Hell, the final cutscene in War Eternal is the best cutscene in the entire game imo.
---
This really makes me look forward to seeing more! :)
---
I definitely got the impression that they wanted it as a stepping stone to help people get into raids. So I don't think their plan is to abandon raids for them.
---
B is a reasonable worry, but if they're not popular then personally I'm fine with them dropping it. I don't want them spending limited resources on failed ideas.
---
We don't know, but definitely they will change it. I would not be surprised if they change the UI as well.
---
Whats a wvw alliance? Like guild alliance or server alliance so its 2 server vs 1?
---
They probably abandoned the idea just like how they abandoned expansions.
---
Can somebody give me the li ks to patch notes
---
if lord krall comes around I will be floored. That's like defeating the last boss
---
This basically explain it. People spend more on keys for the latest black lion skin than they would on an expansion.
---
&gt; but in competitive modes, the community owns the game modes and chooses what we work on
---
kek
---
Dude, it's been waaaaaaaaaaaaaay past the point where people can cope post about how Anet wants to do right by WvW but X Y and Z are standing in their way.  
---
Way past.  
---
They aren't "being malicious" but to say they're actually trying is laughable.
---
this summer (cuz its still technically summer).. get ready for.. the FULL RYTLOCK
---
I'm really excited by what few details we did get, but I wish they had described what the heck a "saga" is supposed to mean for GW2. That, and I think the community really needed to hear at least something regarding the game post-season 5/Icebrood Saga. I kept waiting to hear something to the effect "...and this Saga will set up the plot for the next expansion". I am a little concerned, and I hope they address this soon.
---
:hyperpenisboat:
---
i believe according to the memoirs after episode 5, he had at least 2 since he says cubs IIRC
---
"We have literally nothing new to show you or talk about, so we won't. We'll be in touch"
---
First of all dont forget its only small percentile players who do you speak of. Casual and true hardcore players have still lot of to do. Speedruners and veterans might find game boring but there are very little games  that will u keep you entertained for so long.
---
"The fans thought a PvE oriented living world announcement would be about PvP and WvW so it's Anet's fault"
---
If you want a casual game made by casual devs, go ahead and buy it.
---
If you want anything else, try another game.
---
Give up on GW2 and just go play ESO. The WvW is better there anyways.
---
Wvw has been light lately.   But that's meant more 20v20 fights, which are nice compared to 20v50, no matter which side you're on.
---
Did they actually say Ep 1 and 2 are free? I may have missed it. If they did, that would make me feel better.
---
I know I just sound like a broken record at this point but it really burns to think we had a great system with alternating LW seasons and Expacs and it's just gone with nothing to show for it. We'd be heading into a new expansion right now, with new elite specs and whatever other awesome stuff they'd have cooked up.
---
I really wish, if not while the game is alive, then maybe after GW2's time has passed someone can do a candid post-mortem on how we got here. I'm honestly dying to know what Anet was working on that they felt was so important that it completely upended a good content delivery system that the game had always been striving for. Unfortunately we may just never know.
---
It's supposed to be a re-imagining of the worlds themselves. The idea of "servers = worlds" is dropped, and each "season" a matchmaking system groups WvW players into new "worlds" of roughly equal teams.
---
Players can mark a guild they are a member of as their WvW Guild, and the system will keep them with other members of that guild, and guilds can create "alliances" between themselves and other guilds, so that alliance is on the same team.
---
There's tons more [information on World Restructuring / WvW Alliances](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/26547/world-restructuring) here.
---
I'm sure this will be explored in an interesting manner, for example how a leader and followers with core beliefs that differ still working towards a mutual belief based goal effectively. There's no way they would relegate this to an extremely convenient revelation that the commander stumbles upon to disband the mustache twirling villains of the week as GW2 bravely answers the question of "Is misogyny bad?".
---
The big thing with the expansion part of the question is elite specs. You get maps from living story and other stuff, but elite specs change up the way you play the game. People don't want to use the same builds. they want new ways to play the same characters or new weapon choices for those characters.
---
In my opinion,. if Anet had said new elite specs would be coming with Season 5, you'd have cut out a considerable amount of complaints. Particularly since Anet set Season 5 would be expansion like content.
---
I just quit my static and i think it might disband with the recent announcement. If you want to get into it there's going to be a lot of vacancies.
---
I mean I am on the NA server but I've never (and highly doubt) anyone ever says 80% of SC benchmarks. Also, if that LFG doesn't interest you, then don't join it. If you feel like you need to train more, join a training guild/discord server. I can understand why those who put in the time to train, don't always feel like carrying others who don't necessarily know what to do.
---
I was in a similar situation before. I only raided in the start for a tiny bit then quit. Last year I wanted to finally get back into raids, when I quickly learned that i neither have the proper dps, nor am I confident with all the mechanics. Luckily some players told me about these training guilds where I was able to build up LI and get better at the game. Couple months later, I was able to get full heavy legendary armor.
---
Raids are not meant to be casual content. And yes, just like in ANY game or game mode, you will have elitists and some jerks too. But, stop saying raids are toxic just because you may struggle with them personally. Sometimes, you might need to actually practice or ask for help to get better at something.
---
Ranger's are staring down the barrel of having their only good weapon's damage gutted so it could always be worse.
---
Just start workin on GW3
---
:benis:
---
Most of what you said isn't relevant to potential new players. They're not comparing GW2 as it is right now with any point in the past. They don't have years of grievances against decisions ANet's made.
---
What a new player wants to know is "If I spend $40+ on this game, am I actually going to be playing with other humans or am I going to be all alone in an empty world". If an MMO is regularly producing new content then that tells potential new players that the world isn't empty. Everyone knows that if they start playing an old game that certain parts of it will be empty. That's inevitable. What they want to know is whether there are new experiences to be had that will keep players coming back. Regularly scheduled content releases do that.
---
Whether any piece of content is repeatable is personal preference and people looking to play GW2 know that. What's repeatable to you may not be what they like. All that really matters is convincing them to try GW2. Once they're in, they can figure out what piece of GW2 they like if any at all. Retention is a separate problem.
---
I personally enjoy playing the story, and have done so across all 9 classes - even though it's not something you would like to do there are people who do it.
---
&gt;The problem with new fractal anyway is that nobody would do fractals aside from the daily ones, and maybe some particular ones that are good for farming.
---
This is why dungeons were a superior format to fractals and their universal reward system.  
---
Even if certain gear was more appealing to people than others (half the pop in CoF armor in 2012-2013) you still had people wanting weapon/armor skins from all of them.  
---
The only way they could solve the problem and stop with the forced daily trio's is to create a party finder that dumps you and 4 others into a random fractal and you do this X amount of times to get your dailies
---
WvE isn’t fun for this PVE player.  It’s a tedious grind you have to do for a gift of battle every now and then.  No progress, just eternal fighting over nothing.  Literally nothing.  Oops ganked, respawn and walk back.  
---
Luckily I did a week worth of oops ganked respawn and walk back so now it’s oops ganked respawn and warclae back.  So there’s that.
---
I’m not sure alliances are the magic fix to make me care about pointless zerg ganking for pips.
---
Yes, XIV leveling feels exactly like Vanilla WoW. But I quit that in 2004 after reaching level 20 and deciding I was bored already.
---
Most people *originally* bought GW2 on the promise that it WASN'T WoW. Although I see more and more complaints about how it isn't more like WoW. I really don't understand why people are flocking to WoW Classic but like you say... different strokes.
---
The main issue here is that I don't want to play XIV. Or WoW. I want more skill-testing content to be added to GW2. And not knowing if it is even coming is frustrating.
---
I went back to XIV and did a few more levels and exploring the world is decent but the quests are as bad as the ones in WoW. I'm so tired of everyone copying WoW. If you wanted WoW, wouldn't you play WoW? Shouldn't other MMOs be defined by what makes them different to WoW?
---
I really liked the GW2-style dynamic events, although they sometimes have higher level ones near lower level quests which is a little annoying.
---
If GW2 died tomorrow, would I sub? Probably not. If XIV was more like GW2, it'd have a better shot. But it feels like WoW-lite. Diet WoW. And, despite all the flaws, BFA has really amazing dungeons. I miss them. And I miss how refined tanking is in WoW.
---
Also, ESO has a better shot due to the fact that it has fantastic quests and a sub isn't required. I do wish that a hybrid sub model was adopted by more MMOs, where a sub is required for challenging end-game content but you can play most of the base game without it. At least that way, I can get to max level and see if I would even enjoy end-game content.
---
Are you saying that longer post titles automatically somehow get more attention? Or are you saying that more descriptive (and therefore usually longer) titles are more likely to be upvoted? If it's the former, I don't follow the logic. If it's the latter, it's actually an improvement to the subreddit if people start making longer and more descriptive titles.
---
WVW is dead, it has been dead for quite a while and only the faith of a few people clinging to a bygone era has kept it going this much. It has become The Stomping Ground of the crybaby casuals. There is no way to resurrect it, that ship sailed a long time ago
---
Lifesteal is a minor dps boost (about 150 dps iIrc). 
---
And even without this bonus it's a new and possible cheaper source for Power food (+100 power, +70 ferocity). You can get [Cilantro Lime Sous-Vide Steak](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Cilantro_Lime_Sous-Vide_Steak) for less than 1g currently and I think the pices for ingredients will drop more. 
---
It's a little bit more expensive than [Bowl of Sweet and Spicy Butternut Squash Soup](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bowl_of_Sweet_and_Spicy_Butternut_Squash_Soup) (~20s), but you can share it with your whole squad / with the whole Aerodrome. Let two people eat and it's cheaper. :)
---
Yes they announced it works the same as past LS. If you log in when they are "current" you unlock them for free. You need to own PoF to actually play them.
---
Turns out if you build siege people yell at you.  And don’t dare pull those tactivator levers that aren’t explained at all and are everywhere.
---
But it’s not all bad!  Sometimes you find a tag that doesn’t tell you to fuck off and follow it for a while and then he vanished and you have no idea where the Zerg went.
---
The commander spent the entire Path of Fire expansion chasing after the villian with no plan or concept, suddenly died, undied, then continued chasing *with no plan*!  Meatoberfest couldn't add stakes to a plot that linear.

Anet often greatly misunderstands what it would take to get fresh blood into WvW.  
---
They think they can entice people with a mount that is terrible or highly subjective skins that are less shiny than BLC gear
---
WvW is the one game mode I practically never touch. I’ve had some good times there but it’s just not something I’m interested in making a big part of my gameplay. But because it’s so hard to play casually, I end up just not playing it at all. I want to get the warclaw (more due to completionist tendencies than actually wanting to use it in wvw), but I often end up playing at odd times because of my schedule, and I find there’s no one on and nothing to do, so I can’t make any real progress towards it.
---
Last I checked, there are 2 content patches this year, with a third coming in mid-Sept. Produce nothing? U might want to tone down on that hyperbole.
---
&gt;Or did some manufacturer dupe them into ordering these? 
---
This is exactly what happened, but I think it's more "leggings designer does most of the work, ArenaNet gets a cut of the profit".
---
Anet: "Alright team we need to change it up for this big update, living story is out what do we bring in?"
---
Random Anet Dev: *Rapidly googles Thesaurus and types in 'story'* "Living...SAGA" 
---
Anet boardroom: *Massive cheering*
---
GW1 had Alliance Battles for that, and they were really fun and pretty popular among the casual PvPer crowd.
---
I'd say it "saga" just emphasises that we get a new story arc
---
The objective stuff is not very fun at all, especially for most veteran players.  A lot of people play for the fights instead.
---
Yeah, it's a pity. Gw2 is the MMO that I've played for the longest, ever since HoT was announced. I have zero legendaries but I have all classes maxed, some of them twice because I'm stupid and deleted characters.
---
Dynamic events, the first time I saw Shadow Behemoth and Fire Elemental world bosses, the first time I did Auric Basin and DS metas, seeing my friend react to those things the first time and bringing her through HoT... It's so unique and one of a kind.
---
But I'm 100% sure gw2's glory days are over. 
---
Elder scrolls is another series that I love the combat is just a no from me, dawg.
---
In the beta the mobs did this! I remember using LB #5 on ranger and all the centaurs would just run out of the AOE bubble before the first round of damage would hit them. Made any AOE pointless and killing things difficult. They dumbed down the AI at launch because - I’m not joking - any AOE was useless against mobs so it was a bit unfair.
---
Simple yes/no answers would be really satisfying.
---
"The only people who say it are white knights like you."
---
How about a little bit of practice what you preach. The whole use of the term white knights to discredit what other people are saying is one of the main things wrong with what's going on. People can have a different opinion than you without being white knights. 
---
This whole idea that you have to dislike stuff in order to be right is part of the big problem right now.
---
There are people who like the way the game is and it's what they're looking for. 
---
I'm not saying you don't have a right to complain, but this almost content use of white knight on this forum to discredit people you disagree with is out of hand and doesn't make any of your arguments any stronger.
---
Yes!
---
Hoping to pick up that new title a year early are we?
---
Yes ofc everything is always about the new players, fuck keeping a consistent playerbase if we can get in a few f2p players! WOOP WOOP.
---
It's the happy consistent players that bring the moneys, not the short lived new player influxes. 
---
&gt;Whether any piece of content is repeatable is personal preference and people looking to play GW2 know that. What's repeatable to you may not be what they like.
---
No, this is a defineable thing. Rerunning ls3 maps cause you think is fun is not repeatable content.
---
Raids/dungeons/fracts/spvp/wvw/world bosses/meta events, are what's tailord and sold as gw2s repeat loop.
---
Now due to the "casuality" gw2 has been aiming for lately, this has all been neglected so you can instead just run silverwaste 24/7 and get better rewards, cause why not.
---
Anet has pushed most of it's content in a way that makes it more effective to just farm gold than to play any of the actual content to get what you want. And since most new stuff is gemstore, gold to gems is the best way to get it.... 
---
The new maps has helped a tiny bit on this with their ascended trinkets, but you should be able to aford those pretty easy and fast so you can rush back to SW to get that hot gold.
---
Updating vanilla maps for new players? They never said that.
---
Great questions. These are things I think we all would want answers to
---
Damned if you do, damned if you don't. Can you guys make up your minds?
---
oh, so we CHOSE power creep, a single stale gamemode that does not have emphasis on pvp combat, and combat that has been dumbed down to the point of consistent spamming
---
Thank you very much.
---
I've got one question for you though, would you mind stand besides Rytlock if you find him and take a screenshot? \^\^"
---
I have. You'll notice things popping in weirdly sometimes, but it runs smoother for me.
---
That's not how that works my man. I only made account because people are seriously taking things too far. Not every post is garbage but theres been so much hate for these devs. It isn't all their decisions and calling for peoples jobs is just immature.
---
For gw3 to have a chance to be released in vr it would need to have a chance to get released at all
---
How did I use the term White Knight to be condescending? Please explain. I never said it is because your opinion is different.
---
And if that is the only thing you take away from my points in response to your arguments...
---
Wow..you’re so clever.  
---
People have second accounts and so what? Does my opinion matter less because this account is fresh?
---
The best way to communicate what we want is to remind ArenaNet when, where and in what contexts they were most successful in reaching the community. I think it would be productive to remind them that they do have an effective option they've used before to address severe criticism, state goals, evaluate, iterate and set expectations for future episodes and content releases.  
---
Right now the sub-reddit is a mess of constructive criticism, less-constructive criticism, satire, memes and vitriol.  There's reasonable, constructive and moderate criticism, but there's also a lot of "toxic criticism," and less positive, mean-spirited criticism that seeps in and erodes mental health.  I think it's important to say what's on your mind, but I think it's also savvy to realize that this is a situation for Mike Zadorojny or Mike O'Brien.  I would not in good conscience recommend any dev read the sub-reddit right now, would you? 
---
Many of the comments here right now make you *feel* good, but that's all they achieve.  The sub has legitimate criticism, but there are factions here that downplay that and enjoy kicking people while they're down for the count and hurting.  Should you really be so proud of that?  Is that the best way for you express yourself? Hurting the people who hurt you? Hurting the people who develop the game we care about? I want them to communicate too, but you're not helping -- you're just pushing people away.  
---
I think that players have a right to be angry and frustrated, but that this "explosion" of frustration causing ArenaNet to disconnect, withdrawal and bunker down until an official letter or statement is deemed necessary.  I have no doubt that ArenaNet reads criticism surrounding GW2; in 12,500 hours I've seen it; it isn't always what I want, nor do I always agree with it, but they absolutely do listen.  
---
Anyway, that's what I have to say about that.  Going to bed.
---
Good Zerg fights last much longer than 5 seconds, if they aren't one side just isn't prepared to take on the other.
---
No but your attitude coming in is crystal clear. Frankly I think that the OP's post was a bit condescending, but I never felt like two wrongs made a right.
---
Nice criticism receives no response. Gotta call them trash for them to even speak out.
---
In pve: any fight where you get more than 1500dmg per second, the -10% incoming dmg is pretty good. Else use the lifesteal on crit. Nike explained it on youtube
---
Sorry, I did let the pettiness get the better of me
---
I'm with you regarding the Open World, that is what made GW2 unique, everyone does Raids, everyone does Dungeons, other than Warhammer Online which is dead, and Rift which might as well be dead GW2 is the only game that remotely does that well.  I'm hoping these Strikes might bring that back to Open World.
---
As you said, they most likely have nothing but they should tell us that and what they're planning to do.
---
I'm also curious about the Deluxe Heart of Thorns Upgrade. Will that still be available in the gemstore or will it leave permanently?
---
I wouldn't beat myself up. That is very very easy to do here.
---
Why? I own Anthem and have been very active in the sub. Sure it descended into memes and shit posting but what do you expect when you falsely advertise a game and shit all over the community?
---
I don't see a vocal toxic minority at all.  Link me some of the posts you're talking about as I'm interested in what you consider to be "toxic" posts.  The vast majority of the posts I see are not toxic.  Negative perhaps, but not toxic.  And negativity isn't necessarily a bad thing
---
The difference in DMC is the rewards are relatively equivalent between difficulties; all items (aside from maybe some outfits) are obtainable without touching hell mode. Some items in GW2, aside from outfits, are locked behind the "hell" mode. Imagine having to beat hell mode to get weapon upgrades for Dante.
---
No, but it is a cornerstone of Western Civilisation and one of its' key ideals, which is what 99% of people refer to when talking about free speech.
---
&gt;falsely advertise  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; have been very active in the sub   
---
&gt; I see maybe **1 in 40,000** people who say something TRULY offensive
---
Edited to reflect that as that's a decent point. It was originally meant though as a "games leeching players and developers and lackluster to no new content on the horizon" comment. However naturally there are still players who enjoy the game regardless of everything. 
---
However I'm curious what part of the game you think IS in a good place right now?
---
They didn't explain. As they didn't explain any of the other details, that's the issue.
---
I get why you are defending GW because I also really love that game but fuck ANET, its a trash tier company that thinks merch is more important that game content.
---
I mean, the writing's on the wall that they intended for GW2 to more or less end after War Eternal, and receive only minor content with a heavily stripped-down team while ArenaNet worked on shipping their next project. They even said in the narrative guild chat after it launched that they had written the story such that it could be the end, even though it isn't.
---
Bound by Blood will probably confirm whether this is true or not. From what we know, a season 4 episode was spending three "releases" worth of time in the pipeline before it came out (9-12 months). So if Bound by Blood is comparable to an S4 release (doubtful at this point as it's explicitly called a prologue) it would point to it having been in the pipeline before the restructure, even before episode 5 came out.
---
I really hope so, I'm sick of the desert theme by now and never been a fan of it...
---
Figured you'd coward out...
---
I'm not mad or surprised at it. I figured they'd be too stingy to give out a level 70 one when there's insta-80s in the gemstore nowadays. They are good for leveling key farmers if you ever intend to do that. Getting 3 keys a week is just something chill I do while watching random crap on youtube.
---
&gt; this went on from week 1 onwards.
---
It was a dead game from week 1 onwards. Some just hadn't realized that yet. The game did not launch in a viable state. 
---
&gt;I don't like this one-sided "devs should be open and communicative with us, and we should be able to bash them as hard as we like because we're paying customers" line of thinking. 
---
This is a complicated topic to grasp, because yes, but also very much no. 
---
Of course nobody should be personally offensive towards developers, personally attack them or harass them, or whatever.
---
But of course players should *also* point out flaws in the *product,* make clear when things are in an unacceptable state, and point this out early and often until things get fixed. They should not be overly rude in how they convey this, but they shouldn't be silent either. Valid criticism is not harassment, no matter how loud or constant. 
---
But *some* people will *always* be rude. You can't shame them into stoping, you can't complain them into stopping, they typically do not care about hurt feelings. The community has ZERO control over them, ZERO responsibility for their behavior, and moderators can only do so much to keep them in check. 
---
So the solution to those rude people is NEVER to just abandon the community entirely, and it certainly isn't to "call out" the rude people, because that will NEVER slow their behavior in the least, and only serves to alienate the good fans who feel accused by association. 
---
The solution is to **ignore** the trolls entirely. 
---
Always.
---
But *also* to engage with valid criticism. Make clear that you *hear* valid criticism. Make clear that you *understand* valid criticism, even if you don't necessarily agree with it. 
---
Trolls are **never** a valid excuse for developers pulling out of the community, and they are **never** the fault of the larger community of the game.
---
Rubi, is that you?
---
Yes, they introduced a farmable event, which in my opinion, is great. I mean we freaking have a dragon laying on the Map, doing various things to prevent it from healing and 3 build up camps that lead to a final attack. While also having a champs&amp;chill train after. I love the event for what it is.
---
No, not really. That's fractals and raids.
---
Barbie Dream House is a gold/item sink and shouldn't be a primary feature of anything.
---
Not much going on. Anet managed to pull off the impossible after massive layoffs and the cancellation of all non-GW-based projects, had kind of a small we-made-it party for themselves and invited a bunch of people for an announcement, but didn't tell anyone that it's just a we-made-it party with an announcement, so everyone thought the guys who never say anything have to have a lot to say if they throw a whole fucking party! So now everyone is let down by the fact that next to nothing has been said, and crazy people seized the moment to shit all over the game from start to finish because it's not the game they want it to be. Yeah no shit, hasn't been that kind of game for seven years, what else is new.
---
GW2 is going into its fourth iteratation of Living World / Living Story called 'Sagas' and everyone is curious as to what to expect. (Because Anet didn't tell us! Yesimsalty.)
---
Please explain why everything in this game should be a participation trophy
---
80% of the players don't enjoy them because the players that enjoyed, or would've enjoyed them, left even as soon as 2012
---
It's easy to say that the game is in great place when you are literally THE demographic this game has changed to cater. 
---
That said you can't just turn a blind eye to everything else and pretend it's ok 'cause the thing you are doing is being supported. I would be ok too if I got a raid wing and a fractal every other 3 months. The fact is I don't but I don't give a s*** about open world so a new episode every 3 months is not content for me. It's not to say I mind the LS episodes or dislike them but If those patches don't come with a raid wing or fractal or a balance change but only with a play through once LS episode that patch has nothing in it for me. The last time I was actually hyped for update was december 2017 with W5 and fractal reworks.
---
Next someone will say go play something else or come back when they release something for you. I can't and I don't want to. Fractals and raids are the content I WANT to play just asia you want to explore. They are the social activity for me with either static raid group or static fractal group. The thing is with this support that social circle has tried out. Imagine that happening to your guild. Wouldn't you be sadan/angry/dissapointed?
---
I largely agree with your comment except one bit. 
---
Arenanet is a company. Guild wars 2 is a product that people have bought with the promise of continued support and content and in exchange those customers continue to invest money in the product. 
---
Arenanet completely does owe their customers. Without the customers Arenanet would not exist.
---
&gt;But of course players should alsopoint out flaws in the product, make clear when things are in an unacceptable state, and point this out early and often until things get fixed. They should not be overly rude in how they convey this, but they shouldn't be silent either. Valid criticism is not harassment, no matter how loud or constant.
---
yeah sure, and you think that's what happened in that subreddit?
---
Shut Toby!
---
Rytlock because of plot armour
---
Anet needs to stop trying to defend what has been done, and act on what needs to be done.
---
Starting by giving us a roadmap, or things to look forward to, and ETA.
---
No they were not. People always underestimate how small the portion of people who enjoy challenges are, especially in niche game genres. This isn't a fps/moba/BR which is completely full of casuals. There is a reason you can have games like dark souls which are relatively popular despite their difficulty. Classic wow and it's next 1-2 expansions were tedious and grundy and despite that they had way more players than gw2 ever did.
---
Thank you very much for this post! It speaks of the big problem ArenaNet has been dealing with for a long time! Legitimate criticism is left out, only when the shit burns properly it comes a nebulous answer just to smother the flames, but the embers remain.
---
You're either trolling or retarded, so I'm going to leave it at that. But you confirmed to me the average IQ of players who can't do current raids
---
This subreddit's response is sadly the exact type of thing that the tweets referred to in the first place.
---
You're god damn right.
---
Wait, why is this getting upvoted, but not the [fanart I personally commissioned](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cy5o6m/jormag_has_a_tempting_voice_i_think_im_in_love_3/) which pokes fun at Jormag as a temptress with a hot voice?
---
Guess I need to commission something sexier...  :(
---
So you can't then. So why should I have to explain why players *should* be able to unlock items on their account that would make them happy?
---
When the game was released, it was absolutely not marketed to hard core players. The tag line everywhere Anet went was a living breathing world. The no end game comments at launch were just this side of rabid. Many people left the game early on because there was not enough end game.
---
Anet even said straight up in interviews before launch, they  deliberately talked about PvE a year before they started talking about PvP because they didn't want people to mistake this is a PvP-centric game. This was never Guild Wars 1. Not from day 1.
---
While I don't speak for them, I don't think they're offended by her tweets. It's just exhausting to frequently have the community portrayed in a negative light. I like Matthew, I like Rubi. But two highlighted/in-the-spotlight recent responses from "inside" the company (even though we lost Matthew in the layoffs, unfortunately) are focusing on the negative response from the community. For the most part, I feel that our comments come from a place of concern, passion, and even love -- not vitriol. It feels like there is some weird Us vs Them mentality going on, and posts like this on Twitter only exacerbate the issue. Now we have this very Reddit thread -- and it raises a good point. We don't need this further division.
---
Scepter torch, sword focus
---
I am happy.
---
Got hot free for my 2nd account 
---
Yesterday hot maps were full like they had not being for months
---
It is a huge win for us veteran casual and they are right community is toxic and do not deserve answer till it does not educate  itself. Vocal minority of self proclaimed veteran pro are killing this game
---
tbh for me gw2 is in the best place of its whole time and it countinue to become better and better, only thing thats getting wrose is the gw2 reddit, because its flooded by hateers and shitposters
---
The sound from the character creation is related to what is happening in the instance for character select we will probably get an update.
---
She was conflating the very vocal and toxic minority with the entirety of the upset population.
---
People don't like being called out. They don't know how to deal with the sense of guilt.
---
I would like to point out that word "developer" is used far too liberally here. The real devs (coders, artists) are usually the ones delivering both content and concrete news. And they are awesome. It's always some story writer or a mod (and almost always a woman) that plays the victim card.
---
Where have you ever seen me turn a blind eye to any comment? Ever. I've said I personally enjoy this game, and people who like what I like, my demographic probably enjoy this game.
---
I have often said everyone has the right to voice their opinion and more recently have said that if I were a raider or Pvper, I might well be disappointed as well. I never ever said no one complaining has a point.
---
My issue is three fold right now, and this behavior is quite common on reddit.
---
1. People think their demographic has a certain number of people in it, so much so that they feel they can speak for all veterans. They can not.
---
2. People call other people white knights or fan bois to discredit them, even if what they're saying makes perfect sense, or is even factually true.
---
3. People who are disatisfied use the most hyperbolic terms they can use to try to make the game seem  in worse shape than it is, in threads not talking about their demographic at all. Earlier this week, some guy comes in and asks are there still people in low level zones, all he wanted to know is if it was too  late to start. There are people in low level zones, and he wouldn't be alone. It's the only real answer. Instead of get some guy saying i wouldn't start this game if you're a hard core player because...having nothing at all to do with what the guy asked. Nothing he asked made me think he was a hard core player, and the fact is, most people simply aren't. The vast majority of players in any game aren't hard core. 
---
Tell you what. I'll stop "pretending the game is okay" when you stop pretending that the hard core audience is so vast that no one but them exists in it. 
---
The game is in good shape for people who play the content I play and I promise you, there are more of us than there are hard core raiders.  There are probably more of us than there are hard core raiders and Pvpers combined.
---
I'm not saying that you guys shouldn't have content, but you guys should stop trying to make it look like the game is dying because it doesn't cater to or support your specific demographic.
---
It's poop and or faeces. 💩
---
this is becoming a literal circlejerk
---
Sry I’ve been wondering, what is mod? Are they AI or actual human?
---
If they do that'd be amazing for everyone. All ANet needs to do is ACTUALLY TELL US stuff like that. If it's not confirmed there's no reason to expect there will be.
---
No problem I'm happy to give words to so many devoted fans frustrations.
---
It‘s permanent
---
Yeah. Events are the game's bread and butter. There are little ones and then larger ones that tell a story that end in an epic boss fight - the shadow behemoth in Queensdale, the Fire elemental in Metrica Province and the Great Jungle Wurm in the Caledon Forest are three lowbie-friendly world bosses that are worth seeking out. The [event timer](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers) is useful, and it's not unusual to see them advertised on the LFG. 
---
At level 30, story dungeons will open up, starting with the Ascalonian catacombs. They're worth doing (use the LFG to find a group, or literally stand outside the dungeon) and ask people. That's your first taste of grouped stuff, probably. Each one has a story mode and three exploration paths, which are more difficult. They're usually worth a level each, so are good for when you want to speed things up. 
---
Personal Story unlocks every 10 levels, so you'll get another story chunk at level 20. Crafting is a good way to force yourself up a few levels as it drops huge amounts of exp. Getting a skill up to 400 will get you eight levels, which is quite useful to know when you. 
---
Personal goals are a bigger thing in this game than most MMOs and until that clicks it can feel very aimless. 
---
[I wrote a guide for new players](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Gulbasaur/Things_I_Wish_Someone_Told_Me_-_A_new_player_guide#Before_level_80) that you might find useful, but there is also a joy in discovering things for yourself.
---
They won't admit to any of the communities desires not being on the table, because then those people will definitly leave. Now, they just keep you in the dark for the future with your hopes of raids, WvW, PvP updates or elite specs so that you keep logging in. If you enjoy playing the game for the content it has good for you, but if you're not happy with the current or upcomming content I would put the game aside for a while.
---
Im guessing you didnt watch the live stream. This was how they ended the show, real grand finale
---
It's bad enough having this shit clog my front page, I'm not putting myself through the inane task of gathering links for you.
---
Even the original post that brought our attention to Rubi's tweets was stupidly titled "Rubi's response to the community's reaction" when her tweets had nothing to do with the community's reaction, and had everything to do with harassment and toxic behavior, specifically.
---
I feel you. While I mostly just lurk on this subreddit I've seen a lot of people go and I have next to no friends left playing the game because they just got bored mostly and got tired waiting years for things arenanet promised. And it's sad since GW2 still has so much potential. 
---
Here's hoping arenanet one day wakes up and realizes that they need to be upfront about what they can realistically do with the game. That's all the game needs.
---
This this this.
---
Lol that's funny that's one of the games I was referring to in my post. I was there for the huge and justified backlash to the recent event and they did the exact same thing and it's really got to stop :(
---
It was only an example. I doubt that they even lnow how much episodes the new season will have or how the story plays out. Let alone maps, bosses, mechanics, drops. I think they dont plan more than 2-3 episodes ahead. And thats the problem.
---
Preach brother
---
Yeah, the angry responses followed by a week of silence and then a brief "we'll do better...... anyways moving on".  Are you one of those FrEeLoAdErS?
---
I’d also add that companies often deliberately  build addictive features into their games, which helps their pocketbooks. Addicted fans are more likely to attach inappropriate levels of importance to games and are more likely to include a segment of people who react in poor ways.
---
We can objectively identify whether or not GW2 is in a good place by asking the following questions: How many people are playing the game? How much profit is the game bringing in? Is it sustainable?
---
These questions are not subjective. The answer is the same whether you're a hardcore raider or a roleplaying casual. And the answer is no. The game is not in a good place right now. It's dying.
---
maybe they didn't know ! or maybe the players expectations are too high ! 
---
I'm sure it's not cause wow classic was coming out and they lied to avoid some bleeding by creating a fake "hype" over something during wow classic launch !!! I'm sure it wasn't !!! Don't even try to imply it !
---
I don't agree. There are still casuals left, like me, who can organize that stuff. I organize stuff now that I never would have organized three, four years ago. 
---
It won't be the same guys and it might not be quite as fast, but that hole will be filled. The hard core stuff, the raid builds and metas not so much. I don't think this game will have a massively strong raid community. I just don't think not having that will negative affect the game much.
---
I actually don't care at all about the announcement. I don't play much, partly from being too busy partly because of other games. 
---
I'm not even offended by the tweets, I have no reason to be I'm not a toxic or abusive person. 
---
What I don't LIKE and what I'm tired of is the whole trend of lumping in the 99% with the 1% bad actors and painting a narrative that everyone criticizing the game or company is doing so in bad faith and has no valid reason to do so. It's a terrible and unprofessional excuse for these companies to take. Playing the victim is not respectable at all. 
---
That was handled incredibly poorly and there was simply no need for that. It was throwing gasoline on the small fire.
---
They don’t see it all...in fact the average redditor will see WAY more posts in total than any dev. In no way, shape, or form, are they receiving such horrible messages each day that it’s outweighing the constructive criticism. 
---
Not to mention it’s beyond easy to ignore comments, posts, and private messages on Reddit and other platforms even like Twitter. 
---
If a post looks negative, ignore it. As soon as someone starts acting like a piece of shit and insulting the devs they can easily move on to the next comment. 
---
On top of that, they, like most devs, ignore the feedback then comment on the people sending death threats. Apex devs just did this as well. 
---
I’m sorry, but it’s easy as fuck to deflect negative messages. Especially if you are in an industry like this with very vocal customers. Either grow thicker skin or find a new job, because it is going to happen whether you like it or not. Learn to ignore it and focus on the positive and helpful customers who give real feedback. 
---
If you can’t handle negative feedback in particular when it’s completely constructive then you don’t belong in the industry.
---
This is a great comment and perfectly explains it good job lol 👍🏻
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; We don't know what specifically Rubi was referring to. Their tweets were just broad enough that it is difficult to determine what she means.
---
&gt; Are they calling it "abuse" because fans are disappointed and venting about it on reddit? 
---
It wasn't that broad. She gave a lot of examples of things like comparisons to turning off the power during winter. It's pretty clear she's not talking about simple criticism.
---
i give up 1 hour ago. We will be playing wow classic. Im not fan of pve games but dnt want to wait anymore because of my friends. They was waiting for me.
---
thanks.
---
It wasn't because of the message,  but in how you voiced it.
---
Your post was more "train of thought" where the underlying anger was visible, while OPs post is properly structured, uses correct interpunctuation and calmly voices his opinion.
---
(This is not at all supposed to be an attack on you! Just trying to show why OPs post might have been received better.)
---
You can't use logical reasons for why anet does things. Otherwise please explain to me why they barely market the game? Or you think companies are perfect? Look at games like anthem and fallout 76 and how hard they failed. The companies thought they're were doing smt good.
---
If you want numbers, then you can just look at wow. A far grindier and tedious game had at its peak 12 million players willing to pay a monthly sub to play it. Anet could barely make 25% of that number log in to play their game for free
---
The dedicated WvW community is more than burnt out by trying to keep the game mode afloat while being last in line for updates or attention. 
---
I can't speak to the difficulty of the Alliance System they are trying to implement. I do think you highlight a potential and actual issue. If  Alliances get full then people will still separate when their friends join later on. I think its fair to say that even the veteran MMO community likes to play with more than one server or group of friends. 
---
So I've been suggesting for awhile that Alliance system allow people at least two alliances to select from. I also think this gives new players a taste of the mode and also a taste of the more advanced play of the mode. 
---
The one worry is that vet players will "downshift" into lower modes to farm new players. This should be discouraged. Part of the discouragement is natural. Vet players tend to get bored farming bad players. Some part of the discouragement should be game-made. Loot from players  of $rankdifference &gt; *threshold in ranks* greatly diminishes. The exact numbers are something to test and tweak. The point being that nobody is going to farm bags from those that don't give bags.
---
How? Please provide some examples because so far all I've seen is people rightfully being disappointed and expressing scepticism about the future of the game and company and asking for more communication. Can you please link any post or decent number of comments to back up your comment? Even just a few posts. If what you say is true that should be easy yes?
---
ANet: \*Secretely working on two random ultimately cancelled side projects* &gt; \*great content cycle between LW/Expansions*.
---
I hope that if they do they also change the UI more to have a better character select and maybe show backpacks etc
---
Well, duh. This allowes them to ignore legitimate criticism and push false narrative.  
---
Hypocrytical snowflakes.
---
Mobile formatting is hard! Should be better now. Thanks.
---
Let me call them a bad name so they can respond just to me and act like a victim.
---
Then say that....?

Look, I can’t say for Anthem, but this happened with Valve’s Artifact too. The first few weeks were full feedback and ideas and some positivity, but when something is fundamentally broken and the companies take half-assed measures to try and save face it’s better to just move on and forget, even more if they try to place part of the blame on the costumers (which wasn’t the case in Artifact, Valve is smarter than that.)
---
There are dozens of us
---
For any of the people outside of the open world players the is dying. That is the point! It's not that it will completely die. There will always be casuals for whom a world comp is the pinnacle of the game but for everyone else the game is already kinda dead. I didn't even say that "we" are the vast majority. I didn't even say we were a population. I just said that for me personally the game has died because of lack of support to anything else than open world and mount skins.
---
My comment, though I left out a word, was that entitlement is to expect to never hear a mean message online.
---
You translated that as not being treated with decency and respect. 
---
At some point, your brain failed you. Figure out how its failing you and make yourself a better person.
---
I've spent a fair bit of time in WvW, and have loved it. I loved it enough that I burned out at one point and now it's hard to come back to it. I also remember how useful alliances were in GW1, and I can only imagine some community building around WvW would do heaps for the game mode. I don't know if alliances would fix everything (I doubt it) but it would be the fresh coat of paint and spruce-up that gets more people interested and keeps them coming back for more.
---
Imagine you have a little accident, at a red light you bump into the rear of another car.  
---
You're insured, it was only a little bump (no injuries to be expected), so in the grand scheme of things everything is fine.  
---
So you get out of the car, and the guy you hit get's out and starts spewing abuse at you.  
---
"What the fuck you fucking moron, are you an imbecile? Are you Blind? Your Mother shouldn't have fucked her Brother so you could understand the difference of the top light meaning stop, and the middle(!) pedal meaning stop! What the fuck am I supposed to do? You Broke my Car! I need that car, how am I supposed to get to Work? How can you be so stupid to do that to me? Were you texting or something? Holy shit you can't do that to me!...."   
---
And your answer to that is a snooty "We will not talk in that kind of language."  
---
In that Scenario you have made a mistake, that caused someone else a genuine grievance. Here I made the overreaction intentionally extreme, but the principle stands, behind that abuse is a genuine problem which doesn't get adressed.
---
Yeah and it's something that needs to stop. 
---
The ridiculous thing is these companies would get LESS flak and bad PR if they just were upfront about the situation and the current state of content.  Instead they do something that of course won't be well received and then blame the whole community for not being happy about it. It's unhealthy and toxic itself.
---
The game is getting better, it's getting constant updates. Since 2018 we've gotten:
---
* Living World Season 4 Episodes 2 - 6, each having a new map, new legendary weapons and accessories, new events, new masteries, and gear/gear sets
---
* 3 new mounts (roller beetle, skyscale, and warclaw)
---
* 2 new fractals, one in June 2018 and one in January 2019
---
* 2 new raids 
---
* Rework of Dragon Bash event
---
And more, and we are now getting Living World Season 5 coming in 2 weeks with a whole new slew of content coming. Then there's also all the content in the game already that people can play, I'm pretty happy with the amount of content this game gets. Especially with how the dev team just recently underwent a massive restructuring, now they have more content teams to make even more content.
---
&gt; If you want the game to have a future and continue making money off of it then stop blaming your customers for not being WOWED by your lacklustre announcement and engage in open dialogue and be upfront about where the game is and what the future realistically looks like. 
---
Honestly, this might be harder than you realise.
---
ArenaNet is just the developer, not the publisher or the shareholder. The latter get to decide what happens to the game, and they can do more or less whatever on a whim. ArenaNet gets resources allocated to them, and it's up to them to choose what to do with said resources.
---
There's no pleasing everyone. They could split their resources and deliver incredibly lacklustre updates to a broad range of systems, or they could focus their resources and deliver much better content to a select few systems. It's obvious they chose the latter.
---
Considering the massive layoffs earlier this year, there's no doubt that they've been stretched thin. I'm positive that they'd love to do much more with the game than they currently are, but there's a limit to how much they can do.
---
The games industry is a piss poor industry to work in. Employment is uncertain, the industry in general is abusive, it's stressful, and it's underpaid. To then have individual employees be forced to deal with vitriol targeted at their personal accounts, families, etc. I'm not at all surprised that we frequently see responses like this.
---
Heck, responses like this has been common for decades, as conditions can change at the drop of a hat. What seemed possible to deliver in a month one week, might seem impossible to deliver in a year the next.
---
This all could change of course if game devs stopped allowing themselves to be trampled all over. They need to unionise and get rights as workers. Make it expensive to lay off 150 people, don't allow companies to just hire and lay people off at a whim. Until such a time comes, things won't change.
---
You know, when that one dude strutted in with his poncho/neckerchief/cape thing, I thought they were going to announce capes or perhaps dyable backpacks or something else the community has been crying for.
---
Instead... He was just a dude in a poncho, on a stage, trying to sell us leggings? I didn't know how to react. I was struck by a sense of awkwardness AND disappointment at the same time! xD
---
I was responding to a comment, not thread. Feel free to follow conversation.
---
Might be good if they'd no include it with the deluxe upgrade from the gemstore. I believe the extra slot was for "veterans" that pre-ordered only though?
---
I fear they simply don't have the manpower for 3LW+Expac teams. Maybe the expac team got shifted to their other projects and was part of the layoffs. I honestly think they haven't worked on an expansion at all between PoF and now and only have the LW teams. I hope they prove me otherwise, but I doubt we will see an exp in the next 2 years atleast.
---
That tweet specifically addressed harassment. Why did you equate it to be directed to any fair response? You're agitated but there's clearly a loud portion of the community that harass the devs and throw abuse at them all the time. Don't make the post about yourself.
---
I really liked (well, I continue to like) the Norn cultural armors. I'd really like sets that are focused on the spirits. I think it'd be awesome having an Asura dressed up in Ox armor.
---
I made a [comment elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cxtf9r/the_rytlock_and_bangar_teaser/eyprw5m/) about what I think the Charr will do (tl;dr they're going to unify with plain old Nationalism as the motivation). So it would be neat if there were armor sets related to the legions including Flame Legion that aren't as garish as the dungeon armor.
---
I know these are both pretty 'basic' ideas that are pretty much just pandering to the simplest aspects of Norn and Charr culture but I don't think ANet can do justice to more abstract/esoteric ideas when it comes to armor. I mean...just look at Bladed Armor. 
---
I'd also recommend not getting your hopes up on Charr armor improvements. ANet has fucked up Charr armor so many times even in Charr-centric content. Expect no tail holes, and expect horns to clip every helm that doesn't outright cut your horns off. Same as always.
---
Nah, as long as they get that one toxic comment, they get immunity for any criticism.
---
&gt; expecting to get most of them answered in an event that was explicitly presented as a LW announcement was 
---
Well I don't think it was unreasonable because they said they wanted to introduce expansion level content with the next LW releases. So Elite Specs could have been mentionned.
---
Raid and fractals were always (except for W7 because of circumstances) bundled with LW releases too, so it's not too far fetched to think they could have talked about it too. They talked a little bit about PvP and *cough* WvW, they could have talked about the PvE endgame too.
---
&gt; They're not speaking for the company; they're speaking for themselves.
---
Oh? Why do you think people get sacked from time to time even tho their were ONLY speaking for themselves?
---
You automatically represent your workplace on social media even if you like it or not.
---
I want a reason to WvW more than "I need a gift of battle again"
---
Yes you were responding to a comment about the subject of the post.
---
No, again, most players just *do not want* to WvW. They do not like green eggs and ham. You can *bribe* a PvE player into doing some WvW, hide cool armor or weapons behind it, make it a requirement for crafting legendaries, put a mount in there, and they will play the *bare minimum* it would take to acquire those things, but they will not *enjoy* that experience, and there it no benefit to the game to having players engage in activities that they are not enjoying. Reward players for doing what they enjoy, don't bribe them into doing stuff that they do not.
---
This sounds like a bug. If this is the case newer players will permanently have access to a shared slot less than current players
---
&gt; Are they calling it "abuse" because fans are disappointed and venting about it on reddit? Or is there some creep stalking their social media? We don't know what Rubi's post is in response to.
---
At the same time she would just use the extreme cases to silence all criticism whatsoever with it.
---
&gt;Now, if this was a Pay to Play game, everything would be different and the entitlement would be justified. Just sayin.
---
This has always been and will always be a shallow arguement.
---
Monthly fee or not this is still a game the community supports financially. It's still a game the community enjoys and wants to see do well.
---
I mean, this is fair. Nobody deserves to be abused or be made to feel unsafe because they've worked on or presented a product that evoked emotions in the customer base. 
---
I am, however, increasingly curious as to why these are the only things we're hearing about from the company. It's been several months of radio silence about anything other than feedback on toxicity. It's a bit worrying, in more than one sense, because it makes me wonder if there's actually anything they can talk about. If there's anything in the works. At all. =/
---
Just common logic; ArenaNet claims 11 million people have made accounts in Guild Wars 2. Do you really believe GW2 has 6 million active players? No, odds are extremely high (guaranteed, really) that the number of people who have at one point played the game and are no longer playing vastly outnumber the currently active playerbase.
---
Sorry do nothing isn't really a good or useful solution to anything whatsoever. 
---
Oh and this post already has 300 upvotes, at what point does this stop being me "complaining" and start being a community action? Or is anyone here with a different view than yourself just not part of the community?
---
I don't think so. Iirc everybody who bought the exp got a shared inventory slot with a boost inside.
---
You can't, but you can always delete all your characters.
---
If you do so, you can send your gold to me first : )
---
Anyone else feeling a mild Jessica Price like storm brewing here?
---
Anet claims they’re trying to rebound after the layoffs but it seems they just buried their heads in the sand even deeper. Even Mike Z looked unhappy during the presentation.
---
[I dunno man, a simple search seems to do the trick.](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=delete+account&amp;commit=Search) [By the way, this is a poor attempt at a veiled passive aggressive post.](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001357228-I-Want-to-Delete-My-ArenaNet-Account) [See ya.](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000712327-I-Want-to-Close-My-ArenaNet-Account)
---
Ah, sorry. Extra Character slot is waht I meant, gonna edit it.
---
How can the party be over when the party is just about to start?
---
Of course a customer can be entitled.
---
What's so bad about it? Anthem or what BioWare creates for a while not is absolute dogshit and you would be pretty naive if you'd think the devs didn't know that themselves. They get paid to create that pile of garbage.
---
I got the impression from the live stream that they were indeed planned.
---
The problem is that plan was "add expansion level features", With no specifics ironed out or actual work started.
---
&gt; But they won't openly talk about what they're working on/what the future holds. 
---
That's up to them, but really, generally speaking, devs should. I mean, in Anthem's case, it likely wouldn't help much, because I doubt the developers *own* any answers that would be constructive, but I have every expectation that ANet is not in that boat, that there is a bright future *planned* for the game. 
---
I get that they want to surprise us, so they won't tell us everything. I do think they could probably tell us a bit more though, spoil a little of the mechanics involved in "episode 1" so that we can see what this new "saga" system would offer that "seasons" could not. 
---
But more importantly than that, even if they don't want to give us one *tiny* scrap more information about the game itself, there are *still* things that they could be doing here. They could just address that they spent about a month or so hyping up a "grand reveal" here, and then what they revealed was. . . exactly what player expected from season 5, no more, possibly less. That was not cool. They need to put out a statement of apology to the community for that decision, the decision to *build* expectation above and beyond what they had any reason to believe they were prepared to deliver on. The community reaction to this **cannot** have taken them by surprise. 
---
Period.
---
I'm hoping that their focus on fewer maps that expand over time will lead to something akin to SW, where the meta that we played changed multiple times (first it was just forts, then the mordrem bosses underground, then VW/labyrinth). But hopefully it culminates in something at the same level of quality as a HoT meta, because the one thing HoT got super right was the map metas.
---
&gt;To be fair the GW2 community has been against each other for a while, it's why I kind of laugh whenever people say GW2 has a great community. It's really no better than any other MMO. In some ways it's actually one of the worst.
---
It did have, Especially coming from GW1.
---
Things change over time as people leave, new people join and of course we get fuck up after fucking fostering cynicism and dissapointment. When anet does cater to one aspect they usually fuck it up in some way leading to one side complaining they got something and the other annoyed someone is complaining they got something in the state it shipped.
---
Anet used to have much better community interaction and a cohesive team with set goals in mind. Now it seems like every content team has been given a different over-aching action plan.
---
Training runs are far from hard on requirements. Exotic gear is fine for getting into raids, however ascended trinkets are extremely easy and fast to get nowadays anyway.
---
There's plenty of builds to play on every class and almost all of them have at least one that's easy to understand, even though it may not be the top tier build.
---
I wouldnt give up just because of a few bad experiences. LFG is most of the time a horrible way to get into raids, but joining a guild is a lot more successful and generally a lot more fun because you get to make some friends on the way.
---
When it comes to wvw, a sudden and massive impact of players is never fun to anyone because of queues. Mmost of the warclaw collection could be done in eotm as well (which works the same way like pve map instances) and to be frank most people werent even interested in wvw, they just wanted a new shiny. Only 5 days after the update (basically after 1st weekend), the queues went back to normal which just confirmed that.
---
Wvw players love when people try the game mode because it's what keeps it alive (since there's not many things keeping you in wvw as an old veteran because of extremely slow updates and balance patches), but when you have massive influx of players, it's just not fun to wait in queue for hours and some people get more frustrated than they should be.
---
Not to mention that not everyone who tags up during that period is an actual wvw commander. I've seen a lot of randoms that tagged up for the sake of speeding up completions or just to troll.
---
I'm going to leave that to actual professionals in the field.
---
I suspect the Wikki crewe has an insider from A.R.E.N.A. but I can't tell any more at this moment.
---
There are many bots in PVP right now. I had a game with two of them who took the exact same path throughout the game, standing on top of each other and making the same exact movements the whole time. Its frustrating but there's nothing we can do.
---
Come to Baruch Bay, and see how many people play WvW. 
---
WvW is not dead.
---
Most of them are more irrelevant than you think actually, especially if there's some people around.
---
There won't be anything specific. It's a defelction tactic to avoid handling criticism while allowing someone to feel righteous while doing so.
---
1 First  I Say its kinda  exploit and dont say mehr using Multiboxing and that plants dont vanish when not harvest is not absuing a game mechanik to gain advantage over other, you can the advantage that you dont need to farm for the materials every day and get more per day
---
Completely agree. I see vets with virtual 100% completion of the game complaining a lot on this subreddit. But i'm sure that they are not that much of the general population of the game. But it is not just vets but any kind of group can be dissapointed by announcements because their topic of interest was not in the there.
---
Here is my tip. Go play other games for a while. gw2 is not made to be a full time game after you've completed most of the content.
---
Mod is short for Moderator. They're volunteers who help run a community. This subreddit has its own moderators who are part of the GW2 community, and other subreddits have their own moderators.
---
Not to be confused with reddit "Admins" who are paid employees of reddit. Moderators are not paid or employed by reddit.
---
&gt;	will actually let them make the saga feel more like an expansion.
---
If that was the plan they would’ve showed it. Why develop elite specs and not even say they exist? It’s not going to happen.
---
Thank you passive aggressive answer. ;-)
---
While taking the money the players thought was being used to support the game. Lmao.
---
It is because you use a ingame mechanik (the Mechanik that Plants dont Vanish if you dont harvest them) to get  an Advantage over other (the players which dont have others Accounts) so Player which have only 1 Acount must farm them every day in pve or buy them. But you dont have to do that because you use a Mechanik which not every player can do. Thats for me is a exploit.
---
&gt; took the exact same path throughout the game, standing on top of each other and making the same exact movements the whole time.
---
rofl yes. I've noticed this before. You should use a pull skill and pull them into corners, their pathway gets screwed up and they can't move. Then pray to Dwayna no team member of yours is foolish enough to kill them anyway to take away the free 4v5 advantage u've just created, Which is a loooong shot.
---
I really can't agree, the ppt aspect is boring as hell in the end and fights are everything.
---
&gt; Entitlement is expect to never hear a mean message online.   
---
&gt;You translated that as not being treated with decency and respect.  
---
&gt;At some point, your brain failed you. Figure out how its failing you and make yourself a better person.
---
I guess you really went ahead and shoved your point down his throat huh?
---
&gt;All that “we want” (minus you) is to know what is the plan going forward and what might we expect regarding the future of expansions, elite specializations etc. And maybe a comment about how close they are to completion instead of saying soon.
---
The problem with this is that if devs talk in general terms about things they would like to try, things they might be working on etc etc the community *expects and demands* that every little detail be delivered. If they indicate a timeline for *anything* and that content is then delayed they are flamed and abused constantly for their "failure".
---
It is my experience that some players just lack a good solid dose of common sense in regard to these things. Unfortunately, these people also seem to be the most devoted keyboard warriors, charging forth, spittle spraying as they screech their displeasure. I have only been playing GW2 properly for a couple months and I can tell you now that if you took "GW2" out of many of these posts and substituted "the game I used to play" they are identical.
---
And I have never understood the way player demand a "roadmap of future content/releases". They aren't the damn CEO. I personally am happy enough to know what is coming when it's announced. I don't think I am entitled to know every little detail. And as I said above, players (a small proportion of the playerbase) bring the whole situation down on themselves for being completely unreasonable.
---
No.
---
So what are the gems for? Isn’t that paying? And all the money people were spending on supporting the game was actually being burned on cancelled projects.
---
It would be nice and a good change of pace. I just question if it’s a high enough priority to change it to something new when there really isn’t much complaining about the PoF one.
---
The reality is a lot of people only play for fights, so objectives are only a motivation so as to create fights.
---
Fights. Ppt is irrelevant. You get with a good group in comms and you seek out other groups who want to fight.
---
You think maw is difficult? What? How?
---
Id just love old hot back. Or id love to see the first one. I wasnt here for launch char screen.
---
I'm really looking forward to seeing more Norn and Charr (and hopefully Kodan) stuff. The Far Shiverpeaks was my favourite area of EotN, especially around Drakkar Lake. I've been playing the original game recently and did the "Curse of the Nornbear" missions where you find out what happened to Svanir and have to track and kill him. The Sons of Svanir have always been one of the parts of the story that they did really well (even if they only really appeared in brief segments of the Norn personal story and one of the S3 chapters) in the transition from GW1 to 2.
---
I always assumed that the reason they didn't let females into the gang was because it was his own sister that killed Svanir (with the player's help), and you do see some of that in their attack on the Jora statue event in Wayfarer Foothills. I am hoping they don't go too crazy with the real world social issues in the game, and see this as some kind of "revenge for women" kind of thing, but I'm excited to see where they take the story.
---
Brilliant, will start using now, cheers!
---
So...
---
No 2v2
---
No Swiss
---
No balance (needs to be monthly or at least offseason)
---
No better rewards for wvw roaming
---
No Alliance update
---
Yes wintrading
---
Yes very bad matchmaking
---
Yes bugging monthly
---
Yes cancelling ToL and 2v2 AT
---
Yes killing HoT specs to make people buy PoF
---
They said they'd be taking questions in advance and answering them throughout the show - which they did.  They didn't promise an *interview*, use the word *interview*, or say anything that rhymes with *interview*.  So... we can find something different to complain and whine about now, right?
---
Criticism is great, as long as it's constructive. Most of the posts that are posted as "criticism" are just vitriol. Obviously, not every post, but a lot.
---
And if you notice, I gave criticism with advice, and the first 2 replies wipe it aside without thought. Food for thought. I'll take your advice in consideration.
---
Currently, I'm subbed to this because there are good posts here too, but I have reddit set to best posts so I don't have to read the dredge. But then someone gave this thread an award by accident.
---
All i need is one comment from a dev. *one* comment. "every episode of the Icebrood Saga will bring a fractal or a raid, the same release cadence we had for Living World Story Season 4."
---
While I'd *like* them to increase the raid cadence drastically, I love the game and I love raiding and would happily take another season of eight months between raids as long as I know *they're coming*.
---
I wish i hadnt deleted the cap before the wardrobe update T.T
---
Primarily I would decide based on gameplay comparison and reviews instead of bundles or sales. What’s the point in getting a nice price for guild wars if you would enjoy eso more and other way around?
---
Check out both games and go for the one that suits you more
---
I don't like the hyperbole about all the criticism are toxic and offensive
---
It's even worse when you realise that someone who is playing through S4 now will have maybe a few minutes of story between her dying then getting resurrected. It was tolerable at the time because we had months of waiting and speculating. Now it's just like "oh noes she died!"... deep breath... "never mind, she back"..
---
Fractal groups fill up pretty quickly but it's usually quickest right after the daily reset, and most groups only do the daily fractals. It can appear to be dead because LFG is often empty, but that's because groups aren't sitting around waiting to be filled. Challenge Mote groups are harder to come by, but that's a long way off from where you're at. Dedicated guilds are better for CMs.
---
Raids are also not dead. But they were never widely popular. The kind of people who do raids are also going to be the people who are more active in the community (top guilds/players, on forums, reddit, discord, etc). Gw2 efficiency has consistently shown over the years that &lt;20% of the community plays raids often. So if you ask a random player how raids are going you will most likely get no response. But of the people who do raid there is a concentration on training new people and organizing regular raiding throughout the week. It's not a majority of the gw2 community but it doesn't need to be. There's enough to go around for those with interest.
---
So with a little effort you'll be doing tier 4 fractals and raiding daily.
---
And I hope you enjoy the hole in your wallet :) seriously though, which thousand of dollars were you at before deciding you'd spent way to much on something you clearly did not enjoy?
---
Hope you bow out of Classic before dumping another few thousand, while I find it hard to actually believe, I do admit I find it worrying if true.
---
&gt;Most of GW2 is not in a good place. That's not abusive or toxic to say that it's just the truth
---
What if Rubi and the others don't know the difference just like their forum mods?
---
I don't like it either that many of well-made, skilled gameplay videos are ruined by some awkward or very loud music. Would rather hear normal in-game music and sounds. Can't enjoy complete silence either (by muting).
---
You might be able to get Support to restore it for you.
---
Yeah, they kind of painted that scene not exactly the way it went down lol. It's a very minor character that you meet for like 10-15 minutes of story, and is just there to be a (admittedly quite shocking for what they are allowed to show with the age rating) example of what's going on in the world. Think of it like a graphic example of someone getting branded by Kralkatorik (which is pretty much exactly what was happening). There was nothing more to it than that really.
---
Most of my time in gw2 has definitely been pve focused. 
---
I enjoy WvW sometimes, but it feels like it needs something more concrete holding it together, and id be all over SPvP if there was a team eliminations centric game mode.
---
Maybe in a few years when he wakes up from Classic. A game from a company that actually makes an effort to listen to their customers.
---
Instead of making fun of them, you could also stop being such a toxic nitwit and support the game and devs if you claim to love them so much.
---
That goes for all of you, really.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm totally agreeing with you on the general point of this, but .... there are lots and lots of people being abusive towards game devs. Not only "1 in 40.000" or sth like that. Twitch chat for example was full of almost only abuse during the announcement, and reddit too was a toxic swamp right after, and anyone trying to be a little more positive or rational receives abuse too. And it goes without saying that those people who are screaming the loudest most of the time leave a mark on others. 
---
Also, I hate people who say "just ignore it!". No. 
---
By ignoring bad/toxic/abusive behaviour instead of calling it out, you teach those toxic plebs that there are no consequences to being toxic and abusive, and they just continue.
---
Just my two cents.
---
weird how the people that complain that devs dont respond to constructive criticism are the quickest to resort to insults.
---
And without Anet there wouldn't be a game to enjoy. I'd keep it at that. Point is, they don't owe us explanations, even if you find somewhere in the ToS the promise that buying the box means they'll be required to keep developing the game.
---
They only reply to toxicity to play the victim card, that's all there is to it.
---
Meanwhile they ignore years and years of feedback, and only bothering replying to fluff.
---
I enjoyed it at the time. For me to spend thousands on classic would take 5 and and a half years. Also I enjoyed it with the previous direction of the game.
---
No problem here! Just the most devoted players freaking out. 
---
I budget well, I'm doing well thank you =) You can worry all you want without knowing anything about my personal financial situation.
---
Wasn't JP all about imaginary sexism?
---
I know I dont. I login once per LS release like intended.
---
Being on this sub has nothing to do with playing the game anyway.
---
There's nothing ArenaNet can do to appease a bunch of gaming-addicted teens who have nothing better to do than binge-play new content over summer break.
---
People just need to go get a fucking job and allow ArenaNet to pace out their content in accordance with their resources and abilities.  They've yet to steer us down a totally retarded path.  Have some faith. :)
---
So when did you stop being a member of the KKK?
---
Anet doesn't rent expansions if you buy the dual pack, it's permanent.
---
They only reply to hate to play the victim card, or to fluff to post dumb stuff.

The amount of detail that went into these mounts is mind-blowing...

Look, some assholes! Boo hoo!

Look, another asshole! Such toxicity!

Lol I'm definitely not sure about it. In the end it's work. And I'm not sure how long the saga is gonna take. I have the feeling that it will be just 3 patches and then we'll get a new saga/season (just speculation tho!) I mean they could make one that's still relevant to the overall story to come, but idk, I don't expect it.
---
It's not resources or lack of content that people are actually upset about. It's lack of communication.
---
In the 21st century there is a brand-customer relationship that companies need to maintain. You can't just use propoganda, you need to actually engage with customers to draw them.
---
They used to be really good at this, but now they have gone back to propoganda &amp; spindoctoring and written off the brand-customer relationship they need to survive. That's why people are pissed.
---
You mean move on with your life instead of obsessing over something you have no control over and start becoming abusive and destructive in the vain attempt to change your level of control, knowing full well that if the company didn't listen to your critizism, they won't listen to your abuse?
---
Now you're just speaking crazy.
---
We will continue flinging shit until we get what we want. Thankyouverymuch.
---
Oof hit me with the nice guy after disregarding what I said without actually giving any information to refute it and just spewing "strawman" when what i said wasn't even close to one. Class act.
---
Because we are playing a game that's been getting plenty of *free* updates. Getting all uppity about an announcement just because it wasn't what you expected seems misplaced. If you don't like what you get, go and play something else.
---
Id rather just play a better game than wait around for 2+ years to see if they remember content exists outside of their interactive cutscenes. They rented a theater for pax and annouced to everyone that for the forseeable future pvp gets armor skins and alliances are coming #soon. For PvE we get ez mode raids after waiting 9 months for the easiest raid wing to date. They ended all of that by plugging leggings and funko pops. If you love Anet so much why dont you buy enough leggings to compensate for all of us.
---
Play every PvP tournament, since PvP is a dead gamemode youll get 10g per tournament for sure by placing in the top 8 teams  
---
Other than that:   
---
\- T4 Fractals  
---
\- Dailies  
---
\- SW/DF farm  
---
\- Raids
---
Then this coming update is targeted for YOU.  All of the content coming in this next Living World episode is going to be pure casual/open world content, except for strikes.  For those of us that find wandering around the open world boring, or are uninterested in the deep lore, we are basically left with nothing other than "find out more in the coming months!".
---
&gt; "GW2 is not in a good place.'
---
Could you please quote the entire sentence to not alter the meaning? Here, let me help you.
---
&gt; Most of GW2 is not in a good place.“
---
This refers to every mode that is not story.
---
&gt; The real question is what percent of the playerbase is unhappy. And you can't answer that.
---
My guess is not enough to care about them.
---
Maybe not, but that's a different matter entirely. You asked how he could know, and there it is.
---
Individually, the charr legions are powerful, but one single legion would be incapable of shifting status quo. Flame Legion tried and got demolished by the other legions. But a unified charr empire would be more powerful than everyone else and could expand east to form a continent spanning empire, at which point no one short of elder dragons would be powerful enough to oppose them.
---
In strategy games this can be referred to as critical mass. When you're strong enough that even if all remaining powers declared war on you, you'd still come out victorious.
---
in b4: "just learn english"
---
Sort by controversial. Have fun.
---
The issue with communication is even a passive-aggressive response or a negative critique will be received as abuse because it doesn't make them feel good, Arena net is in wreck and anything even remotely negative will trigger them in order to justify the bad state they're in
---
Is it fair to make a judgement when you know you dont have the knowledge?
---
it would be hella coo, but i doubt it will ever happen.  
---
 Stupid idiots like me keep dreaming for stuff like this, but deep down i know it probably wont ever happen.  
---
The sad part is they didn't even try to push challenging content(and Raids have a too big of a time investment for new players).  
---
Fractals are just fucking sad right now(not even talking about dungeons.
---
They could just rework these things with something more challenging and better rewards but NOOOOO, gimme that funko pop Mini -.-
---
Anet doesn't want to admit that their game is falling apart in almost every aspect. They don't want to take responsibility for the numerous mistakes they've made over the years. They want to sweep it all under a rug and act like nothing is wrong, and this was clearly demonstrated during the LS5 announcement.
---
They use the extremists as a scapegoat to avoid acknowledging the problems within their product, this behavior was apparent by both Rubi and even Barefoot Matthew on Twitter so it is safe to assume that this is also the opinion of the other employees at ArenaNet.
---
By ignoring the people who *actually* care about their product, not only are they losing players but they are also losing the respect of those who still actively play. They've certainly lost my respect, and as a long time player of the game this saddens me more than I can put into words.
---
The same reason you'd develop a semi-random sequence of mini dungeons to add variety to dungeon runners' content, and then subsequently kill the dungeon content in favor of the new thing. Until anet explicitly says this season will have episodic fractals and raids, which would be a REALLY EASY THING TO SAY if it's true, I'm going to assume Key of Ahdashim is the final raid. It's already confirmed as the final "pof raid" in a blog post, and brought the gaeting crystal cap to the same number as the magnetite shard cap (and gave the portable exchange). 
---
*Can* anet just do a third raid currency and set of raids? Absolutely. Have they given us any reason to believe they will? No. The only mention of raids in their lw5 event was during the strike boss announcement, and raids were only mentioned to be disparaged as difficult to get into and hard to form squads for. Not a peep on if raiding is going to be a form of content included in future releases.
---
Where did she say 'the entire community needs to shit up'?
---
Seeing how they don't even have the look of the new World Boss finalized, it might as well be they *simply don't know at all* what they'll be able to deliver in the near future.
---
We still don't know how many people play the game. You're just asking me if I believe 6 million play the game. That may or may not be true, no one knows that unless you have the actual stats on player numbers.
---
I don't think companies are perfect. But we know ANet is metric crazy. They don't keep all those metrics not to run with them. You bring up Anthem. This is a 7 year old MMO in a competitive industry, without regular expansions that still makes 4 million dollars a month. No sub. No optional sub. No pay to win. That's nuts. You don't see it because you don't want to see it. This is a successful game.
---
I'm guessing it's not successful by accident.
---
Why are you implying the content they put out is only low if you have a job?
---
If you bought it from the store support can restore it for you, I know I got mine back by sending in a ticket with all the information I could find from the gemstore.
---
It took a few days but they came through in the end so don't give up hope.
---
Yes. I don't want to go into it too much, but one of the content creators tried to reach out and ask her about her work on her public Twitter immediately after one of the Reddit LS AMAs and because he was male, she lashed out, very nastily, to his politely worded questions.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if we see the same sites that defended her and ArenaNet's culture to come to the defense of the devs again, and wouldn't be surprised if the devs are hoping for them to do it too. What better way to counter a lot of disappointment than by getting some "big" gaming news sites to label all your fans as entitled, toxic and immature? Again.
---
And thread stealth editor extraordinaire, for those who didn't know.
---
&gt; its still broken and mired with the same problems since day 1.
---
And new ones created by the Warclaw.
---
What's your evidence besides you saying so?  The bar has barely moved on income even without regular expansions and optional subs. What company as done that. This game isn't dying. What you have here is a strong case of confirmation bias. Reddit is not the population of the game...nor is the official forum.
---
These look sweet, thanks!
---
&gt;Most of GW2 is not in a good place. That's not abusive or toxic to say that it's just the truth.
---
Oh hey look at you making your opinion 'the truth' just because you and a vocal minority of players believe it.
---
wrong about what? math testing builds and coming up with rotations &amp; executing them ingame? have you ever installed arc and saw yourself what is going on ingame on meta events? if not, give it a show, you will be suprised.
---
It's a bad guess. We'll see in a year what the earning reports are. Right now, they're roughly staying stable from quarter to quarter. It doesn't support your argument.
---
&gt; That and the fact that you can't downvote, or disagree with anyone without it being a "personal attack" (even if it was just an objective observation and rebuke) speaks volumes to how kitten their forum is.
---
I literally called someone out when he said not wearing armor in PvP didn't affect your stats. My comment was removed and I was infracted because "hostile tone".
---
That's the level.
---
You're just being disingenuous now.
---
ANet has traditionally been very lacking when it comes to communicating with their playerbase. I mean c'mon, it's practically a meme at this point. When they conflate a small toxic minority with majority of players who have legitimate criticisms, it really doesn't do much to build bridges with the community. They need to understand that most people let down by the recent announcements are upset because they actually love the game.
---
Nah, nothing surprises me. I've had other guys in the guild tell me my DPS is in the top percent in world bosses. And I don't use a rotation or a meta build.
---
you wont be getting 8th place without a skilled premade. lets not let the circlejerk get to our heads.
---
I'm fine with ascended gear, but infusions should have never happened, specially agony. Build an accountwide system instead, like WvW ranks.
---
&gt; So my question is ... WHY ?
---
Anet doesn't understand Europe.
---
It's honestly quite disheartening that they address the toxic responses more than the actual constructive ones.
---
in what context did he tell you? most people have their arc on standard and think they do big deeps while in fact arc just reads the cleave and put a big number together.  
---
single target stuff is a whole other topic...cleave ain't gonna help you on bosses.
---
&gt; developer talent is frankly wasted.
---
One of my biggest gripes with the game. So much art wasted on cool scenes, instead of actual landscapes and locations we can enjoy properly.
---
See how WoW classic does in 7 years. lol
---
If you think giving workers rights like a liveable wage, and a pension, is somehow going to make them lazy, then you've really drunk the coolaid and honestly, I'm sad for you.
---
It's as if you look for specifically the toxic downvoted comments you'll find toxic comments...
---
But that's from April?
---
Oh...
---
what did you say?
---
I dont know what to say.. i mainly played fractals with my buddies,raids with my static and wvw with my brother and for 2-3 years had a blast...For me lw story was a nice break between challenging content,a time to just chill and play solo. Now everyone left and all i have in this game is story....a single player mmo...might as well go play a true single player.
---
I dont know what to say other than i feel completely allienated with the current game as it is. I hope Anet manage to shape up and find their pace again but for now cya in half a year maybe :(
---
&gt; If I can handle FL4K being a "They" in BL3, I can handle Jormag being a "She"
---
1. Why would an elder dragon being female have anything at all to do with a non-binary robot
---
2. Jormag is also non-binary, and ostensibly also a "they"
---
Remember, YOU have to dig to look for it. Devs instead find those comments in their inboxes and feeds every day. They don't have to go looking for them, they're tagged in it.
---
Right, you aren't wrong, but Anet is comprised of human beings. The human beings that see the vitriol being directed at them are the ones I believe he was trying to evoke compassion with. It's easy to feel like you're "sticking it to the man" when you're being toxic to a business but it's important to remember that oftentimes the person that has to see that isn't the one who made the decisions you're pissed about. 
---
You don't have to think that they're you're friend to not be an asshole.
---
Those PoF leaks really were full of hype. I remember seeing how huge the maps were and being stunned
---
Lol wut, smells like censorship to me. What a time to be alive. Guess that i can't blame them too much since the positive criticism ends up drowning in the huge shitstorm of flaming thrown at them, but still.
---
The thing is...once alliances arrive, you will get those mixed matchups as well. This is preparation for that. It sucks, yes. And especially on EU servers with many languages (french, german, spanish, all others, english). And you know what. Half of europe players *have to* learn other language, they do speak their own language and on top of that they know english, and usually french or german. They never had server for their language.
---
Imagine to go as airport tower operators do - they ALL communicate strategic informations in single language - english - everywhere in the world. So everyone knows what is happening. But then, the rest of radio communication is usually in various languages. You can still joke in french. If someone don't get it, it is his problem. As long as you can do strategic calls so everyone knows what to do, it is okay. It is also okay to finally start forming more smaller groups that cooperate but are independent, instead of one group of 70 people that provides just skill lag.
---
Alliances won't be bound to any language at all, so once they arrive, matchup linking will be even more dynamic. There is no way back and you should prepare for it. 
---
This is said from position of someone who does not speak german and was linked to german server for last 2 months. Language was not the biggest problem, their tendence to run away instead of fighting was.
---
Dojan5, I understand your position. I have never lived in a society where basic social security like health care or a pension are not taken for granted. 
---
I fully understand why many people in the US do lean left. Unfortunately you will have to give up your basic freedoms when the authoritarian left finally takes over.
---
To quote Lubos Motl, a Czech physicist who grew up in communist Europe:
---
Leftists pretty much unavoidably become new totalitarian rulers responsible for tens of millions of destroyed human lives or worse. Left-wing ideologies are unavoidably totalitarian for a simple reason: they want to defend the "natural equality of results", a big lie, and one needs terror and/or Gulags to defend a big lie.
---
A balrogh of morgoth!
---
Ms
---
I mean every community has people that will just say truly offensive shit for very little reason. Why even bother acknowledging them other than as a cop-out to not have to actually respond to legitimate criticism.
---
Can I get your stuff when you leave then. :p
---
On a more serious note, what you are asking for is almost humanly impossible and would decrease the quality so much it is not even funny
---
This was from the introduction of ascended gear years ago, Gaille doesn't even work there anymore.
---
I mean nobody is condoning person abuse. I do wish people would stop giving the toxic posts air time though and instead engage with civil people in a constructive conversation.
---
----
---
[I disagree entirely with this tweet](https://twitter.com/Rubi_/status/1167845793706807296)
---
I don't think it's industry wide at all, It's very common to have road maps and test servers in this day and age - Especially for balancing changes.
---
Lets look at some other MMOs.
---
WoW - Test server and upcoming content known months in advance.
---
FFXIV - Content is known months before.
---
OSRS - Content is known months before, Content is community polled to ensure playerbase is happy with changes.
---
GW2 doesn't have any of this, We don't know when you stop working on something until a year and a half has gone and we've see no addition to it.
---
We unfortunately just get balance changes dumped onto us and have to suck it up.
---
There is no dialogue here and even the recent balance discussion has not posted all the changes so it's hard to grasp the impact the current ones will have on gameplay. We're also restricted to only speaking about those changes which does not help since those changes are just one CoG in a build of many.
---
You don't have free speech on any of the major internet platforms, Reddit, Facebook, Twitter etc.
---
Its a ramp though and fractals payout much more than they require to invest. Also ar can removed and asc gear can be stat swapped so essentially you can play any build on any class with the same gear and infusions. From my experience i didnt need to buy any infusion. Just crafted +9 from all the +1's i got. Well there is nothing we can do about being noob because its on that person to improve but most of the people who shit on others for kicking them never try to.
---
It's not really about dealing with it. It's about trying to reinforce your own opinions and thoughts by bouncing them around the echo chamber of your followers.
---
It's ironic that you're so butthurt by Rubi's comments and calling them inflammatory, yet your response to the devs is "Eh just ignore toxicity! It's basically is a non factor!"
---
The whole "we don't want to be angry and toxic but you keep calling us that!" routine must be getting tiresome.
---
It was one of the steps needed for alliances I think it was mention ed somewhere. This is the same as some changes to equipment which were made for future release of build templates. With alliances you will play WvW maps with your guilds so generally the problem shouldn't be as big as it is right now.
---
Pretty accurate description for a rant though.
---
We can when we do the same with the most cringey and useless posts like "omg this screen makes my toon so pwety :)"
---
Maan you love praise choyas like we do , you should join our guild United Choya’s Guild [UCG]
---
Its still a he in my eyes
---
A lot of French players moved to WSR, but we only speak English there.
---
Spoken a like a true 100% pve player.
---
Dude erp was 17k viewers. Name the one time the living story got close. You're in for a rude awakening if you think this ends well.
---
People complained and ANet didn't fix it...
---
Tbh when english is so accessible, used practically everywhere (especially on the internet) and even mandatory in some parts of the business, it's actually a valid response.
---
Ill buy the ones roy wore.
---
As someone who would NEVER attack any dev (or general person) directly because of "Uhh my feeling got hurt", it becomes harder and harder with every day to keep that mindset.
---
Would someone at Arena Net please (finally) sit down and read through the criticism this community had since YEARS now? It didn't just happen yesterday that all of the sudden everyone feels unheard and misunderstood. Yes, you have the extremes. I don't like them either. But would you PLEASE talk about all the things that are driving genuine fear into this community?
---
I don't mean balance issues or complaints about quality/frequency of new content. I talk about the future of this game. You had an event planned to show us the future of GW2 and it was the same as what we had up until now. Minus Expansions might I add.
---
Arena Net doesn't need to go into great details like "The next elite spec for Mesmer will be X" or "The next raid will be Y and it's release is in &lt;insert month here&gt;". All we ask for (at least most of the cummunity) is a statement on what the status for all of this is. Tell us "Yes, there will be new elite Specs during this Saga" or "No, we won't release any new Raids any time soon, but we want to make sure that Strike missions are engaging for you to play." Yes, If you announce that raids won't be a thing anymore, some might become angry. Same with elite specs, fractals and any other thing you let starve vor content since months. But at least we know. 
---
Most frustration in the community exists because we don't know what we get later down the road. And this event was the BEST time to talk about all of this. I still don't know if I get more fractals now. I still don't know if there will be a new raid. I still don't know when WvW Alliances will release (if ever). I still don't know if I will have the chance to play my Mesmer with new elite spec. All we know is, that there will be some new features and everything else stays the same.
---
So let me ask one simple question. Why should the community care about GW2? There was a lot of cirticism around how YOU (as Arena Net) handles things when it comes to new content. Did any of this change? Are we getting new Fractals and raids frequently now? Will der be new stuff added to our classes? When is the big WvW update finally coming you promised since HoT? If you can't give me answers to these questions after YEARS of me hoping and working my way through this game, why would I still be interested now after this event? Where nothing really changed. 
---
Please... And that goes to all dev's working on GW2. Tell us why we should care about GW2 in 2020 and the years after. This is all we are asking for since years.
---
Hello there, it is me, Mr. E, head of communication. I was summoned here to address your multiple concerns:
---
* We're very proud of our raid community and will continue to support the game mode!
---
* We're very proud of our fractal community and will continue to support the game mode!
---
* We're very proud of our strike community and will continue to support the game mode!
---
* We're very proud of our WvW community and will continue to support the game mode!
---
* We're very proud of our expansion community and will continue to support the game mode!
---
* We're very proud of our balance community and will continue to support the game mode!
---
* We're very proud of our mount skin community and will continue to support the game mode!
---
* We're very proud of our camera hacks community and will continue to support the game mode!
---
Thanks for your attention, and see you at the gem store!
---
Then people would complain they never tell us anything AND OMG WHY DIDN'T THEY ADVERTISE THIS!!@#!@$##@!$!@$
---
Etc, etc.
---
&gt;Point is, they don't owe us explanations, 
---
 I'd argue management is their biggest issue. I'm a firmware developer, working mostly in an R&amp;D sector, and we'd be in some of the deepest shit imaginable if we were unable to even produce a "public" roadmap for features to deliver, even if it was only tentative with weeks/months times ahead and adjusting time precision as needed as milestones were near. 
---
There's no excuse for a software company to not produce a roadmap for their clients.
---
&gt; Rubi's comments are totally different; not about the game itself but rather the community.
---
Hey, you remember these threads where there is a fat red "DEVELOPER RESPONSE" tagged, and you're happy that there is communication and then it's a lame joke or something about the fav quaggan? Rubis tweet feels like that, only a bit more insulting towards anyone who really cares for the game. If you can't understand why people are offended by that, maybe take a step back and consider how you devalue all the time, emotions and thoughts fans put into that game and who only get "you *all* need to stop being toxic" back as only communication.
---
She should at least have known when to stay quiet until someone can give some useful communication.
---
I mean those people should already know and leave GW2 asap when Anet canceled Pro League. It's very obviously which kind of audience Anet was targeting.
---
This, and seriously how can you lack so much self awareness as a community? The knee jerk reaction I’ve been seeing on reddit over the announcement is absolutely insane and if I put myself in the devs shoes, I’d probably not want to announce anything I’m working on ever again and just let people find out as the content is actually patched in. Like holy shit guys, it’s like you’re asking for that.
---
 I wish you are right and they will make hard mode/challenger version for them but the general feeling amongst the community is that they won't do such a thing. And this is 100% anets fault for not being honest and opened with us. " Hey, we will do this strike missions, easy open-world instances where you can join a queue and be put in a party of 10 ppl. THIS NEW MISSIONS WILL/WON'T HAVE CHALLENGE MODES. " 
---
See the last part? They didn't do that, they keep us hanging once more and most of the times this means rather a strong "no we won't" rather than "yes we will".
---
Also like others mentioned they didn't back up their new strike missions with information about their other instance contents raids/fractals, are they giving up on them, are they going to create more CM for fractals and so on. NADA! Silenzio Stampa!
---
pepperidge farm remembers
---
Changed the icon on desktop, thanks :)
---
But the OCD in me is getting frustrated that the icon in my task bar doesnt change :(
---
&gt;I personally prefer for upcoming content to be hidden until it's almost ready to be released.
---
Oh, that's not a problem either, as you can see in the pic I linked, there are several \[REDACTED\] entries to keep that surprise up. Important information and specifics regarding each of those boxes, even the non-redacted ones was also kept in secret up until the week or two leading up to the content drops themselves.
---
it is indeed bullshit that for now only electric supercars get produced and that there is no really good alternative for normal people...at least were i life.  
---
it goes so far, that other company which did not produce any cars but needed them (in this case electronic transporters or mini  trucks), started to produce their own because the car industry turned them down (smt smt rich people still want to sell their oil and have a sying in the industry).  
---
suddenly there are two sides to a argument, huh.  
---
...but lets stop here, since i really do not want to discuss shit like this. either you see it yourself or not. having different opinions is fine.
---
Rytlock's cubs, screaming "NOoooo!" in the distance.
---
Believe it or not, but they do actually read the contructive criticism.
---
I actually don't know why it's company policy to not engage people. I do know that game development is basically a thousand times more complex than armchair experts on reddit think, so I guess that part of not wanting to have to explain Sisyphus's mountain to people again and again is probably part of the reason. Add to that that they may not want to have people and other companies look behind the curtains as their workflow may be secret, it slowly but surely turns into an environment were engaging people too much is simply not feasable.
---
Not that this explains why there is next to 0 communication. And yes, only ever reacting once shitstorm trolls cross every single line of human decency does give the wrong signal. They foster a sense of positivity and cooperation ingame, but only 'reward' human trash at its worst with attention IRL. Makes you facepalm a bit.
---
They are preparing for alliances which wont have language barrier. Linking servers because they speak the same language definitely didnt work in the past (there were even 3 linked national servers which was quite unfun to play against) because they either get overly populated servers or still bottom tier because of both quality and population.
---
There's been plenty of situations where people were transfering away from national servers because of population issues, but that number was never as big as the last relink when kodash got abandoned.
---
Here's the thing, words have consiquences and it seems the community can only see that one way. If devs/ex devs point out the community are taking things too far in the most respectful way than its seen as going too far, that they just shouldn't down play the community's message in anyway etc... But the community is not able to see how they do far far worst. Like when the community starts stating as fact that the game is dead and there will be no more raids and fractals just because they were not mentioned  in an announcement that focused exclusively on living world that never had fractals and raids as part of it. These types of statements are damaging, they drive potential new players away which in turn puts devs livelihoods at risk and put the game itself at risk. Do they come from a place of love or a place vitriol? It's impossible to say could be either one but here is the thing, assuming it comes from a place of love, what's the point of it ? The right way to handle that sentiment wasn't to tell the world there is not going to be any new raids, the right way was to ask anet to clarify if strike missions are an addition to raids or a replacement, if we can expect new raids etc... There is absolutely no justified reason for this distractive behaviour and it's a bit worrying the community isn't able to even realize what it's doing is distractive and in. No shape or form is it constructive criticism which it seems is what most believe they are doing.
---
Can we keep in mind that, afaik, there hasn't been an official response yet, only hit takes from former employees who are trying to support their friends and colleagues. The only real official a net communication I've seen since thr presentation was a PvP and WvW forum post (THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PART OF THE LIVE PRESENTATION) addressing some of those concerns and the path forward for those game modes.
---
But they don't want you to move somewhere else, so they won't say a word. They're entitled to you as a consumer, but you're not entitled to updates to your favorite game modes.
---
I say we start moving along already. Log in once every 3 months seems less of a meme nowadays, maybe they were right all along.
---
It's already a skin, but it's bugged and doesn't get registered in the wardrobe. Same thing happened with the mace and shield skin from LW4-E5, but they fixed those somewhat quickly.
---
How about you guys start taking an educated guess based on the information you have been given and base your decision of staying or leaving the game (completely or temporary) on that.
---
Look at the current status quo of the game, its current content and those features that have been announced with a release date and just make a decision, if its worth to keep on playing or to leave/take a break.
---
The problem isnt Anets lack of information, its your indecision.

As far as I know, they never mentioned any plans to release another expac but go with LW instead to release those features. They announced the new LW season/saga now, so what on earth makes you think that they are planning an expansion release in the near future? You can expect LW to span over roughly 2 years, so I doubt they will make a decision on how to go forward after that before the first episodes are released and they will know how successful that business model is for them.
---
* WvW alliances
---
Personally, the only feature from your list that I am interested in. Sure, it would be nice to know when exactly they plan to release it in 3, 6 or 9 monts but at the end of the day, it wont affect my decision, if I want to play wvw today or not. 
---
If I think match ups are to unbalanced or I dont care for my server mates anymore, I will simply stop playing it and do something else, in game or outside.
---
* Raids
---
Raids were promoted feature content for HoT, thats it. They already havent been mentioned in the content feature list for PoF and since then have only gotten sporadic updates or new releases. What on earth makes you think that they will do a 180 on that and start focussing on a more frequent release schedule for raids in the future? IT simply wont happen, unless they announce it and they havent.
---
I still don't like roadmaps. I think they're boring and ruin the surprise and hype of new game content.
---
Gold/silver/bronze rewards for raids would be nice, along with more gold. Like maybe 5g per boss and then 10g for call of the mist wings, since its once per week
---
well.. there's a third party tool that exactly does that.. and sure, you need to carry the swap-gear with you.. how else would it work? i mean.. as a old dungeon or fotm runner you always carry gear to swap with you around.. same for raids...
---
Got a few polls stealth removed by her too :).
---
Yeah but some gaming news sites gave her a platform to spew her crap and started blaming the toxic community for her attitude.
---
She pulled the victim card real hard.
---
I said this in this sub before, bugs can be a bitch to get rid of and yet people still think programming is just like waving a magic wand at the computer screen and that's it. That put aside, hopefully the "suprises" they mentioned they would include throughout the saga will include stuff such as elite specs (would be a boon to pvp imo). I also think the stream was kinda vague and whatnot, but we still got a glimpse of what's to come, and that is a lot more than what we knew before friday.
---
Punishing players for not logging in doesn't sound like a good way to monetize anything anyway.
---
If I buy Path of Fire from a different site (for example from cdkeys) do I also get Heart of Thorns or is it just a deal available on the main website?
---
&gt; How else would it work? 
---
Swap the viper armor on my character with the berserker armor in my inventory.
---
I can only afford one set of ascended armor and that's a combo of Valk and Zerker.  If I had to go Condi I'd only be able to bring Exotic Vanilla gear with Vipers Trinkets/Rings/Necks plus I've never played Scourge once.
---
Sorry but english has been the international language b4 i was born. It is the easiest language to speak at a basic level and even in some third world countries speaking even broken pseudo-english is most common. You cant blame anet for this, we are in 2019 and not being able to communicate in English is a major setback in game or irl.
---
Again anet isnt at fault here,only the players themselves for not paying attention at school.
---
&gt;It's just exhausting to frequently have the community portrayed in a negative light
---
The in-game community is pretty positive overall and that’s great. But on the forums and on Reddit the community (which are made of of a small fraction, albeit a loud small fraction, of the overall community.) everything is always negative, nothing Anet does is ever good, and the game is “dying” for years now. Given the knee jerk response to this latest announcement, and the way some specific people have been behaving, cqn you really blame Anet for “portraying us in a negative light”? Personally I don’t think they did that at all, I think you guys did it to yourself and now you’re mad that an official is asking you guys to please stop harassing their employees.
---
I really want to see proof that someone, or anyone sent direct insults to the developers. I am pretty sure it is BS and a good way to twist this around and have Anet play the victim of a "toxic" community.
---
Crafting is a good way, if you have some gold. Playing dungeons daily is a good way.
---
Otherwise I would just recommend to explore maps and do hearts etc.
---
Use all your tomes of knowledge on the earlier levels so you can play more dungeons later on.
---
Sometimes you can also kill the Möbs with the yellow names (boar etc). The longer a mob is alive the more exp you will gain.
---
Just combine some ways to get to lvl 80. There's no super fast way (:
---
Make sure that the website is one of the official retailers (list can be found on gw2 website) otherwise you can get banned. As far as I know, cdkeys isnt one of those and you get both expansions regardless of where you buy them.
---
Dlgamer usually has the best deals.
---
Even if you didn't like the show guys, thank the dev for them effort and be good with them
---
None of those theads explain what they spend 200-300 dollars a month on, in fact only one person claims to spend in that range in that thread. Most people in that thread claim to spend less then 10x that with a substantial amount of people claim they spend less than 200 since the game launched.  But any it's not about them, it's about you, what do you spend 200+ a month on exactly.
---
&gt; But they won't openly talk about what they're working on/what the future holds. By staying silent they only fuel the negative attitude the community has.
---
They literally announced WvW server restructure over a year ago and all they get is shit on because of it. Season 5 instead of an expansion was announced a long time ago as well.
---
The only thing they are silent about is whether or not we will see more elite specs or an expansion. That's a big deal, but 100% radio silent is demonstrably false.
---
&gt;swiss tournaments were announced on the 30th
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/42973/pvp-features-in-progress-updated-june-8-2018#latest
---
They posted about PvP swiss at least 1 year 3 months ago, probably more for the initial announcement.
---
&gt;server restructure is still on the way
---
Yeah I don't think a 2021 release date is going to make anyone happy, they might as well have worked on something else more immediate if it would take them the 3+ years to release, about as long as it takes to go through more than one Expansion + Living Story cycle.
---
They're taking the hobbits to Isengard!
---
&gt; This is said from position of someone who does not speak german and was linked to german server for last 2 months. Language was not the biggest problem, their tendence to run away instead of fighting was.
---
Wait, isn't that supposed to be the French?
---
I know we're all disappointed. ANEt gave us enough material, or more precisely not enough material, to be critic with the current situation. As gloomy the future is for gw2, that image doesn't provide anything to the current situation considering that it's related to the introduction of ascended gear and that Gaile isn't working at ANet anymore.
---
want to use those fancy underwater legendaries on Land.
---
this would be enough for me.
---
They have been developing the fcking game for 2 years now, I am pretty sure they could have hoarded a lot of content by now. But that's not the case because I am pretty sure they have zero content to release. They wasted two years unto nothing. You are twisting the subject by not understanding obvious statements.
---
Not being WOWed ;)
---
Anet need to hire a proper community liaison person that can properly communicate with players and transfer information BOTH ways.
---
The devs, the artists and even the managers aren't well enough equipped to do this. They're too involved with the game and since they're human, their emotions might get in the way.
---
They need someone not involved with development and is qualified to handle the more... passionate player base.
---
If you think that the story in GW2 is good, you must be the type of person who unironically thought the last season of Game of Thrones was good.
---
That reminds me of my first days ingame , I had to change my game to English to made it easy to cooperate with my English speaking guild. 
---
Bonne chance ^^
---
Split the game in 3 modes: PvE, PvP and WvW.
---
WvW players got nothing. That's 1/3 of the current game modes.
---
PvP players got nothing. That's another 1/3 of current game modes.
---
PvE players: Fractal players got nothing. Raid players got nothing. Open world players got story.
---
None of them got elite specs..
---
And so on.
---
We all would love this but I truly don’t think we will see most of these :(
---
It's how most MMOs do it, via subfee, timegates, dailies, monthlies, etc. You can also call it rewarding players for logging in, which I'd disagree with myself.
---
Even if you completely disregard the monetization aspect, it's pretty stupid to stop encouraging players to log in for more than once a season when you can just binge all content and be done. A lot will just forget about the game altogether if they're basically encouraged to forget about the game.
---
You do not have to scream murder, but to dismiss someone because "it's just a game" is just nonsense. Games as big as GW2 end up becoming part of one's life. Anything you commit to on a longer term ends up having importance to you. Also while the updates are free we had to buy the expansion first, so i think we still have a say on some stuff. I am not saying we are the ones who decide what the game gets ourselves, but we should at least be allowed to give positive criticism. That is what helps a game grow for the better imo. If we grow content with anything they throw at us no matter the quality, the game will only get worse and end up scaring people away.
---
Close enough.
---
Whatever spot I am standing in.
---
They can animate skeletons, script AI, script skills and attacks. The final design is mostly colours and ruffles. or things that can easily be amended on an animated skeleton, though
---
I have 0 expectations about the story in an mmo.
---
There are something to consider, that might be messing with your download:
---
1) how many devices are connected in the modem? (if it's too much consuming data, then, might download the game when noone is using the internet)
---
2) Check your internet plan. Maybe you need a batter internet speed.
---
3) Maybe the server of the of gw2 is not letting high download of that.(I think it is unlikely)
---
4) Check if your computer is not doing updatedls while downloading the game.
---
I hope might help you! Have a nice day!
---
It should work for any approved retailer, worst case you may have to open a ticket if ti's not been put in place just yet (apparently this is supposed to go live during the coming week).
---
About cdkeys I would point to the [usual response that our beloved Tybalt has on the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cg98jb/which_retailer_in_the_uk_sells_gw2_gems/eufh0zc/). It probably didn't andwser here because it's not a thread but only a comment so I'm passing around Tybalt's good word manually.
---
&gt;  People are not being genuine...
---
The hypocrisy. ;)
---
Orr is an amazing place. The fantastic design of a lost civilization, sunken under the sea and re-emerged recently. Then of course the evergreens Lornar's Pass / Timberline Falls with their rugged beauty. Pre-Tower Kessex Hills for the rolling-green-hills trope. The Sulfurous Wasteland mostly it's so different, which is immersive in its own way. And then there are those icy-branded regions in Thunderhead Peaks that combine the clear white cold of the North with the hazy purple beauty of the Brand.
---
Seriously? Well that sucks.
---
Yeah not thicc enough
---
I have a few guildmates who do the same, but I always found stuff to do in the meantime.
---
I just don't care anymore, my investment for the game died out after this shitty announcement. It's been years and years of negligence, and it's obvious now that this won't get anywhere better.
---
This is a pretty frequent experience for me, especially around large groups. Skills take forever to actually use, sometimes taking longer than a tower boss lives. Kind of inconvenient that there isn't an Oceania server.
---
If you burnt out with the Griffin then you should avoid doing the Skyscale mount quest line at all costs.
---
I'd focus on catching up on the story, even if you need to replay some older episodes as a refresher. Everything else should fall into place once you get into it again.
---
-Will conquest get new maps?
---
-Will we see a ranked queue for another gamemode?
---
-Has the 10v10 mode been cut?
---
Attacks on parts of their community are nothing new for anet, move along. 
---
Rubi is right with one thing, though: This toxic feedback is happening industry wide, all the time. So tell me, why can other companies deal with it and uphold good and productive conversations with their fanbase and customers, but arenanet can't? Is it maybe their policy and the people they hire for that job? Hmmmm....
---
I am a new player so I haven't played WVW yet and I am curious what are the problems with it?
---
Yes it does, my point is people employ hyperbole to paint things much worst then they are. If some says the game is forcing them to spend 10x what they actually spend then yes that proves the point doesn't it ? You have to understand it's not about the figure itself. You spend 200 dollars per month you have my thanks for supporting the game I love, but when you say you're being forced to spend 200-300 dollars other people who know nothing about the game will look at that and go, I can't afford that, I'll look for another game that I can afford to enjoy, that's why I have an issue with it, inflating the number 10x doesn't have the same meaning and most certainly doesn't change the conversation, so why ?
---
Classic response. You don't know what kind of player i was: I raided and was heavily into WvW. When the content wasn't there, I played less.
---
The 'filthy casuals' argument seems to be a catch-all for when someone doesn't know what else to say. That and the idea that if you're a casual player, your opinions don't count.
---
Nice screen shot
---
2h to get the warclaw. Just 2 hours.
---
Wasn't that ugly backpack supposed to be sylvari themed?
---
People still do SW tho.
---
&gt;Who says that? 
---
I do. I say that. Do you disagree? 
---
&gt;Let's say 20% of the playerbase is into fractals, another 20% into WvW, 20% into PvP, and 40% just casually does some open world.
---
That's pretty optimistic. 
---
&gt;But when a new story rolls out, 90%+ of the active accounts complete it. Why? Because it's the lowest common denominator, low effort short solo content everyone can do, and even Pvp players have to complete it if they want the reward track unlocked. Not to mention that most people do it like a chore now because they've been doing it for years so might as well check it out.
---
Ok. . .
---
&gt;So the higherups who never touched GW2 in their lives look at the metrics and go "wow story is fucking great, we don't need anything else!" and then the community evaporates and the game dies.
---
I don't think "higher-ups who've never touched GW2" make those calls. Those calls are made by the "higher-ups who *have* played the game and have more complex metrics to work with than that." 
---
They're made by people who would *not only* know that most players complete the Story chapters, and *also* know the reasons why they might, but *also* know how many players *don't* play WvW, PvP, or Fractals (or raids, which you left out, which was appropriate to the amount of people who play that). 
---
You don't make decisions based on "how many people *do* play a mode," you make them on "how many players *don't.*"
---
Source to buy?
---
No, you'll have to do it manually.
---
You can use arcdps' build templates until gw2 gets its own, but they dont work in pvp and I doubt that even official ones would automatically update your pvp weapons.
---
What do you mean, I don't have the knowledge?
---
I'm a new player when it comes to WvW and I'm saying my opinion on why I, a new player to WvW, doesn't feel like the mode is compelling and attractive.
---
And as I said, it's all about opinons.
---
Just in case, NerdSlayer might want to keep tabs on this whole ordeal for his 2020/2021 "Death of a Game" episode in Guild Wars 2.
---
The 'jUsT lEaVe' argument seems to be a catch-all for when someone doesn't know what else to say. That and the idea that if you're an invested player, your opinions don't count.
---
I hope they'll give us more information on their future plans, even if the truth isn't what we had hoped for. I hope they'll make another blog post that goes into more detail for every game mode to show their commitment. But they won't write that up on a sunday...
---
Rubi's criticism is absolutely legitimate. Even if it is a minority of the player base that got verbally abusive and hyperbolic in their criticism, the devs have every right to call these douche bags out for it. It's the only thing you can do if you are in that kind of situation. Or do you think they need to stay silent while they're being slandered? Of course not! She doesn't act at all like it's all of the community reacting in that way. She's calling out a few abusive degenerates and rightfully so.
---
My post is hardly 'bothering' you. I'm making a rational suggestion.
---
I was also heavily invested in the game and spent a lot of money to support it but rather than get angry, i know when it's time to move on.
---
On the bright side, no dead pixels.
---
&gt; As a rule I stop reading something when someone brings up the word "entitled" because no one ever uses it in the proper context
---
You. I like you. A+ internet sanity hygiene protocol right there.
---
Probably would've been a good idea if I took a screenshot instead of taking a photo with my phone.
---
Imagine being this bad at what is supposed to be your job.
---
It would be interesting to see the percentage of players who purchase regularly with real money versus those who don’t.
---
Just to add, English doesnt even seem mandatory in French schools. In the Netherlands you get thaught 3 additional languages in Middle school, English (mandatory), French and German (both are mandatory for at least a year).
---
We had some French exchange students and unless you speak French yourself they wont understand a thing. I failed every single French test I made (on purpose, was dropping it as soon as I could and I just cant stand that language) and my French was better then their English, and that is saying something considering my current French doesnt go further then baguette and pain au chocolat.
---
No wonder u did not come far in life with this attitude
---
So move on and dont bother people who want to stay with your moralistic lectures.
---
So the story is also not in a good place too?
---
If you think that 'all your friends' will be able to 'play together' in any alliance where I believe WvW will be more fractured than ever, I have a bridge to sell you, really cheaply.
---
Oh wow, I wonder why clients get increasingly frustrated at a development company that is unable to produce a general roadmap for it's clients. I'm a FW developer, and you can't imagine how deep in shit we would be if we couldn't consistently put out roadmaps to clients.
---
She specifically qualifies her criticism pretty clearly. Nothing she said should be controversial.
---
Because PoF is new and HoT is old and that's how business work.
---
&gt; If they feel personally attacked by the response, then something is wrong in there.
---
I can tell you exactly what's wrong, we *all* know it: It's their work culture. They are not scared of the community, they are scared of their own inadequacies and failures. They don't feel good enough. And their culture is to cuddle up, never improve, never deliver and making an enemy out of everyone who points out when they fail.
---
The issue is that French players have their own language in the game, and as such their objective names, skills and other stuff is just called differently. You will always have a lot of confusion because of it.
---
The difference here is that I'm not trying to discredit anyone's opinion. I've made a suggestion that some things aren't worth getting this angry about and also that 'filthy casuals' can't just be discounted by hardcore players because they don't play as much.
---
Fluff Wars 2
---
Well thats their own fault, really. You can blame Anet for a lot of incompetence for sure.
---
But if there is one thing thats on you its the fact that if you give a company money, its not longer yours and they can do with it whatever they want. Expecting a company to use "your" money for something you like is not only incredibly naive, its quite dangerous.
---
Anet isnt your friend, the money you give them isnt yours. If you cannot live with that, do not give them your money.
---
&gt; Ignore them, ALWAYS.
---
easy to say
---
I'm a producer, I need to gauge the community frequently, there is no filter saying "ignore this comment it's garbage" so you read everything, and it takes it toll, it can be super depressing, even when 95% of feedbacks are positive
---
we are human, only robots can ignore the toxicity, even if most of the community is not toxic
---
[And it does look fine from a distance](https://imgur.com/gallery/IY0nFPf)
---
Since you claim you left, you dont understand the issues of invested veterans. Therefore your suggestion is worthless.
---
Pretty sure I wasn't defending anything. I was just correcting a far, *far* too common misconception.
---
I'd like to argue your hypothetical in detail, but you're clearly are trying to put words in my mouth. Makes it hard to participate in good faith.
---
But, simply put; Yes. 
---
They would absolutely be allowed to do so. As I said, their forums are privately run and thus not subject to the restrictions brought on by the First Amendment. And again, it doesn't mean it's justifiable behavior, but no one's rights are being trampled.
---
Luckily, we as human beings have this lovely thing called "free will" that allows us to disassociate from toxic individuals and organizations. As well as choose to not purchase or use their products and services. Granted, this requires a certain amount of personal responsibility and self control, which is in abysmally short supply in this day and age.
---
&gt;  And if you notice, I gave criticism with advice
---
You told people who care about this game and want it to be good to fuck off, dude. You insult in a general direction.
---
Anyone thinking the Devs will interact with the community in any meaningful way after the Price situation is kidding themselves. Absolutely no one likes taking about that whole mess, but there is no denying after her firing the presence of Anet employees dried up nearly completely on Reddit. 
---
Saying: "maybe don't harass and send deaththreats to employees" is about as controversial as anyone is willing to go.
---
To learn their culture mostly. Its just that not speaking English is part of the French culture. Same goes for the Spanish.
---
Doing these exchanges with German, Swiss or Danish students wouldnt be a problem as they tend to speak English much better. Their cultures are also more alike to begin with, so that makes things easier as well.
---
They are low cost merchandising that someone might like and create an alternate revenue stream for the game so they can keep paying for more updates, much better than loot boxes.
---
You are the guy complaining about other people enjoying something. Don't be that guy.
---
They don't balance classes so necros and guardians are broken there, rewards are crap and honestly there's not much to do. 
---
That's my opinion as a pve only player who's only played it for gift of battle. It has a tonne of potential and it's the most fun I've had in this game, just running around with a friend or on discord with a squad.
---
It's very obvious that reddit doesn't represent even a significant proportion of the playerbase, that's the case in every game. And setting the standard for gw2 at having 50% of all the players who ever signed up be actively playing or else they must have left because the game is so bad is ridiculous.
---
&gt; Schools are obligated by law to offer basic education in english. 
---
LOL you obliviously know nothing about the education and legal systems of other countries.
---
&gt; The comment you described as tired and cliched didnt come from nothing. It came from personal experience. Ill stop this discussion now as i feel you are taking this on a personal level, i feel like you are trying to lash at me rather than discuss valid points and anything i say you will just deny or ridicule out of some sense of pride that i dont understand. Good day.
---
ie: you're an ignorant xenophobe that would rather run away when challenged than back up any of the nonsense you've been spouting.
---
In every big city there're icons of all the crafting disciplines. Just walk to the npc for this discipline and say you wanna start it.
---
They would never say this, but it's actual the truth.
---
Are we having a laugh now? Don't get to attached to a game? Why would you put hundreds or thousands of hours into a game you don't want to get attached to. That's how MMOs work.
---
"CoRpoRaTe doEsN't caRe." They do care if you close your wallet shut. Great times when the new player "oh that's shiny!" filter fades and sees that 90% of it is cash grab only. They care if the player and potential costumer base declines. 
---
Even better. You play the "remember kids, game development is haaaard" joker. Jest on you. After nine month of no new five man content and no insights in development you lost the ability to play it. Possibility of one every three to four month was promised. 
---
Its amazing how some people think devs that take nasty amount of money for two hour paint jobs only to diliver more paint jobs every second week deserve to get defended by them. 
---
Go take a look at Warframe, or the devs that bought Lotro and still grow it, or Project Red, or the PoE guys. There is devs that don't just drain their community until it quits instead of investing the bloody money back into the game.
---
US or EU? Last dev I saw had 11 mastery points. Idk man, idk.
---
Lots of people represent themselves. They play the game and buy things in the gem store to support the developers. They're not whinging on reddit like babies about "WhERE IS neW exPansIon?" when they very clearly announced a new living world season which will go for at least a year. This is your content, play it or don't.
---
Mate, the server restructure has been "on the way" for like 4 years now with virtually no updates on its progress or even what it concretely means for the player base. That's not exactly inspiring hopes in everyone that it will ever be completed, much less awesome if it does come out.
---
im more amazed thay the one person who is being this childish and bashing them with threats get their attention and the rest of the community get ignored
---
&gt; Id rather just play a better game than wait around for 2+ years to see if they remember content exists outside of their interactive cutscenes.
---
Are you having trouble finding one? Cause you're still here, trying to make others as miserable as you are.
---
Strikes are also casual / open world level. They said "easier than raids" . So that makes them , what , like Fractal T4 ? CMs ? I dunno , but I doubt it's difficult.
---
No informations = no plans. It's simple as that. They can't tell it openly because it would be even worse than talking anything...
---
It's a shame really when I knew about the game having big pvp battles I was excited but now not anymore, I was waiting to finish leveling and learning the game to get into it but oh well
---
Now you personally get to experience the high IQ of Anet management. They could have keept alliances language-specific by having guilds and solo players select their preferred language. They took the easy way out.
---
The magic number you are looking for is 7%.
---
Apprx 7% of all demographics, old, young, black, white, male, female, white collar, blue collar, non-progressional, processional, you get the idea, are deviants. These people will not see reason or logic. They don't follow the same ethical or moral guidelines set by our societies. These are your rapists, murderers, home burglers, multiple assualt, bribery, extprtionate, kind of people.
---
This includes people on the internet. Though I and a lot of other people would argue that the 7% figure is more than likely greater for the internet demographic due to the anonymity internet offers gives them a certain level of protection.
---
The 7% figure comes from decades of research by law enforcement agencies. Through statistics and the profiling system created by the Behavorial Science Department with the FBI we have found that approximately 7% of any demographic, including law enforcement, are deviants. Now this number can change due outside factors. Such as economic down turn, war, and/or a shift in societal moral and ethical values.
---
For these types of people, no amount of reasoning, logic, education, training, can fix these people to fit better into a role in our societies that have been built on core values and laws derived from Hammurabi Law and the Ten Commandments. Obviously a lot has change in the last several hundreds of years, but treat other's as you want to be treated has not. These types of people just want the world to burn and no amount of asking for respect will ever get it from them. The best thing to do is block, delete, and ban.
---
Didn't know, thanks for clearing things up.
---
That's a pathetic reason to lock a thread.
---
&gt;  addressing them can only make things worse.
---
I totaly agree that the best response is not to answer, that's why my social media presence is non existent, that the only responses I give is through PR
---
the result is good for my peace of mind, but player disapprove a the perceived secrecy
---
a bit of a damn if you do damn if you don't situation.
---
In this particular case, if I read between the line it's "hey tell me exactly what you are working on so I can see if I'm leaving the game forever or not" how do player expect a straight answer when it would probably kill arena net?
---
They already made a forum post, and told those people to send a ticket to support.
---
Boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew.
---
We live in a fucked-up time where as soon as you say something slightly different from "my god you guys are the best, that's really what I wanted and I couldn't be more happier "you'll be called "entitled/delusional kid that cries for everything".
---
This fucking forced politically correct everywhere is ruining everything.
---
&gt; what on earth makes you think that they are planning an expansion release in the near future? 
---
Not in the near future. Did they just scratch the whole concept ou do they still intent to release one at any point ?
---
&gt; What on earth makes you think that they will do a 180 on that and start focussing on a more frequent release schedule for raids in the future? 
---
I think what we want to know is whether they will continue to release any raid at all or is it now replaced by strike missions ?
---
https://youtu.be/kTfzYbQqC4Y 
---
And this is what monsters like you cause.
---
No, that is not actually what they said. They said "expansion-WORTHY content", which has a completely different meaning to what you said.
---
I guess you're not a big sports fan huh?
---
You know, those activities where they only ever run or drive in circles or put balls or pucks over lines or in nets, over and over, without it ever changing for hundreds of years.
---
Let's ignore that the content comes from engaging the opponents with all the strategy, tactics and meta-gaming that comes from that.
---
In fact, it seems that you do not like games in general, because most of them have all of this in common.
---
Psychologically, negative stimuli and memories can stick out for some people more than the positive. If you were say threatened or mugged, you might remember the details about the weapon a bit more because it was what caused you to feel fear. You forget other details like the surroundings or the exact time, what the weather was like.
---
Of course being attacked physically is quite different from a mean or hateful comment on the internet. However those comments may stick with a person for some time as it can cause a strong emotional state in an individual. Also to what extent have the comments gone?
---
I would hope no one was threatened or told to "die" simply because some folks didn't feel all that satisfied by the announcement. Having to deal with that kind of treatment is certainly not part of the job description and it is not what anyone signed up for.
---
I can't say if staff are just looking for pity points or sympathy. I would certainly hope that the staff realize that the people saying those sort of things do not care for them, the game and should not be listened to. Any company worth its salt is going to take the positive feedback and use it to the best of their ability.
---
I have been playing GW2 on and off since beta. Got my 7 years anniversary gifts, have 4 level 80 characters. Yet, whenever I return to game, I don't know what I can engage in other than fractals, WvWvW and PvP and those are because they have lobbies. I don't know how to do raids, world bosses, dungeons. How can I get in a group for these, and how do I know if I am qualified?
---
Yes its called ff14. And if a meme on reddit makes you miserable, you might want to get outside more.
---
Watching and playing are two different kind of shoes. A lot of players might want to try doing raids but arent able to because they might not have the knowledge, gear or group of people to do it
---
Three? More like one slot is free, the other 9 are gemstore.
---
You don't get attached to a game because it's a fucking game, mate. You play it because it's fun. That's your reward. If it stops being fun, move on. That's how having a hobby works. Stop being married to objects. It's a game. It's not going to love you back, no matter how attached you get.
---
And neither will corporate. Corporate does NOT care about you! YOU are NOT your wallet. THAT is what they care about you. Stop being a slave to them. Close your wallet, move on, spend time with shit that makes you feel good.
---
And don't equal the company grunt artist pouring his blood into sea turtles laying eggs on the beach of the Sandsept Isles with some suit telling him that it's corporate regulation to not engage costumers.
---
&gt; why don't they give to 15-20% of those veterans with just HoT, PoF for free.
---
Because you're never going to get the most recent expansion for free. Move on, forget about it, nobody cares what nonsense you dredge up to try to justify it. 
---
Not. Going. To. Happen.
---
Log in once every 3 months. No one's saying to quite the game for good, but yeah, stop having it as your main hobby, because that's just going to lead into disappointment after disappointment.
---
Yeah, but we're a relatively small studio. Paying full time salary for one just isn't efficient. Whenever a need arises, someone will just make the best educated guess they can. Works for us.
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Screenshot
---
Why should I take anything you say seriously if you resort to things like
---
&gt; They're not whinging on reddit like babies about "WhERE IS neW exPansIon?"
---
I like your list, but:  
---
&gt; New dungeons 
---
Do we still have to list that in 2019? We have know for so long that dungeons are discontinued in favor of fractals, that it baffles my mind that people are still bringing this up.  
---
Are fractals for everyone? No. Are they coming out at a good, sustainable pace? No. Would more dungeons be cool? Yes. But we got fractals. That's the whole story, we gotta move on.
---
[One step ahead of you.](http://imgur.com/gallery/UKVef8I)
---
This company is full of fucking morons and I can't believe you guys struggle to work this out. It's been like this for years. They hire people like that psycho that got fired.
---
who the fuck knows, definitely not me. my guess is phasing out gw2 to focus on their other projects, but that fell through.
---
And there isn't enough players because there isn't enough attention. This is a "snake bits its tail" problem.
---
Especially ESO's. There has not been a game made in the last 2 decades that has worse combat than ESO's.
---
I don’t understand y’all. You payed for the expansions and you got the promised expansion content. I think the devs are not obligated to do anything else other than that. But they are releasing more content. So quit your whining and enjoy what they are doing for us. If not stop playing.
---
I m saying this to the abusive cunts who went out there way to bash the devs. 
---
Secondly you do have a point on devs not considering the feedback the community is giving them.
---
They said give it 72 hours for them all to go out.
---
it was supposed to take up to 3-4 days or smth
---
The achievement panel is basically the same thing, but instead of a trophy room the achievement panel gives you immediate rewards - like backpacks, weapon skins, armor skins etc.
---
I saw a few at Gamescom, but I also saw fursuits so..
---
So the new release schedule will be:  
---
Month 1: Fractal
---
Month 5: Strike Mission
---
Month 9: Raid
---
Month 1: Break, cause delays and team restructuring
---
Rinse and repeat
---
&gt; I've read through pretty much every thread on Reddit in the last 24 hours and I don't think I've seen one hurtful post at individual devs
---
I have seen those. They were relatively harmless and downvoted into oblivion. That is not a community problem. It's some individuals.
---
I find it ironic a lot of the people complaining about GW2's raid content just went and played WoW Classic where the hardest raid in the game was just cleared by a group of people who weren't even max level yet.
---
You can’t surely think Arenanet can sustain itself ad Infinitum on purely Guild Wars 2? At some point there has to be a resource pull away to focus on other projects otherwise 5 years down the line you’re looking at a massively diminished player base and revenue stream without the funds to support the development and manpower of new projects. It’s more concerning that those projects were scrapped in terms of the long term longevity of the company and the game.
---
Or even a dedicated routing server. It would drop pings by 50-70ms...
---
Stop blaming the devs - there's almost zero chance that the people talking about trolls had any influence on the top-level decisions that lead to whatever people are annoyed about. They probably aren't ALLOWED to comment on those things, but what they can do is call out those that are being dicks to them and their friends.
---
A dolyak warclaw skin would be an instabuy for me.
---
With an attitude like that, who could have guessed that people respond unkindly or ask you to get out ;).
---
Once every 4 months is the new standard :p
---
Try playing Asian MMOs or anything by Wargaming. You’re severely stunted without buying micro transaction. And no point in my GW2 playtime have I felt the need to buy micro transactions or felt disadvantaged because I haven’t. This is not the case for a lot of similar games.

User: Gives 20.000 words feedback post in own thread on specific topic
---
Mod: Forums are a happy place, deleted
---
User: I'm out.
---
Anet: Surprised Pikachu face
---
Seriously though. With their reactions and based on what they focus when they get feedback, they are responsible for the discussion culture we have. Sure, individuals are responsible for their own post, but blaming a mythical "internet toxicity" while they  could control in what direction their discussion culture develops (as proven by other gaming studios) is just so... I'm lacking the english words, help me out here.
---
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Heh, I think I understand. Hey, I had a bit of a conversation about most raider's need for their content and especially their reward being exclusive, else they can't enjoy it. Mind having [a quick read](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ck5xga/how_whales_in_mmos_really_work/evk6v5g/?context=10000) and telling me your thoughts? I'd be quite interested in them.
---
Non-stop posts like these, when will it stop? Anet has decided to ignore all of you. It has literally been like this for 7 years, why would they change their ways suddenly when recently they've also shown they haven't changed at all despite saying they will?
---
This game is doomed and has been for years all thanks to people stepping up for Anet (every time they chose to ignore the community) rather than putting a halt to it.
---
Mod who locked thread deserves a report tbh. He locked a thread with only 7 posts removed and at best only 3 breaking the rule he cited out of total of 300+. Does not make any sense.
---
God imagine how beautiful it'd be of people were to provide contructive criticism until they get tired of being ignored and then simply fuck off to find a more enjoyable environment for them.

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:  
---
* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.
---
&gt; but a few people have said they aren't good at raiding or fractals.
---
They're insane. Renegade can bring permanent 5 man alacrity, lots of CC, and either good supporty dps or great heals. Along with a firebrand for quickness, the firebrigade is incredibly meta. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0If9rtWUJ5o
---
You could also be great condi dps: https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/condition/
---
Meta is quite balanced and all classes do have actually usage. Stat wise, for PvE it is still to go for berserkers stats so you kill quickly, as stuff is quite easy. HoT and PoF are a bit more difficult, so mixing some other stats can work, or just get better at dodging and such.
---
Tips: from 3rd to 17th September there is event for double mastery experience in HoT and PoF, as new release map will need those masteries. Also, you get HoT for free when buying PoF.
---
Its obviously the lazy option, but it would make sense if build templates simply change the stats on all of your gear that supports changing stats.
---
Personally, I would get a good laugh out of it if this is what will happen. While playing another game of course.
---
I can't think of any MMO that had gone that long without a word to the community and ended up doing okay. It's seriously a bad sign.
---
Are you sure? Because judging from the insane backlash from their transparency they would have been better off staying mute or just saying 'an update is soon' with no details. P.s. don't ever play a Valve game haha.
---
&gt; can stick out for some people 
---
this is why you don't hire those people as community manager and shield them from the playerbase in a positive, constructive way instead of rallying them against their customers.
---
Devs already have to deal with that sort of bullshit from middle managers. I really don’t think they’re in a hurry to treat their customers as middle managers.
---
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
---
Being done with raids doesn't really make sense since they introduced strikes. Why have a content stream that guides people into raids if you are gonna stop releasing raids.
---
Elite specs are unkown. But i would say raids are pretty certain.
---
Seasons are the main delivery type of content in GW2, and in future most likely the *only* delivery system. Seasons have episodes, like TV series. And they're for free, if you log in at least once during them being live. They stay account unlocked forever. But you have to buy them if you weren't there during them being active. It's one of Anet's incomes. But instead of having to pay for every single one, you only pay if you didn't unlock them. Which is kind of crazy really.
---
You also don't have to pay money for them, you CAN convert ingame gold to cash shop gems and buy them that way. But that's a major gold grind, mind you.
---
Hey, at least your FPS is good! x)
---
Did you read the "new" post about future of competitive modes? For me it kinda has everything in it I wanted. So now they just have to finally get their butts going and bring it.
---
Ufff you hit right on the spot of what i was thinking and feeling about the current state ofthe game, story and the whole topic in general. Thanks for this comment ! :)
---
Yes and there's nothing about new elite specs, expansion and raids. So the best way is to focus on coming ls5 and features which was announced
---
I can't complain about that. I just hope strike missions will have a difficulty at least comparable to t4 fractals. Else it's just an auto attack spam fest that will not pass for a raid training
---
Yeah, I'm running the highest settings. Of course, it does go low when a whole bunch is happening (e.g. Tequatl), but otherwise it's usually a smooth 30-60 FPS.
---
i deleted it like 7 years ago, do you think its still possible? :O
---
Thanks. Think I'll get the expansions then :-)
---
How do they do on living world maps?
---
But Personal story is before any right?
---
If you don't like this subreddit, then leave.
---
I had a [thread](https://twitter.com/Rubi_/status/1167881117082324999) (or [two](https://twitter.com/VaelVictus/status/1167873199700201472)) with Rubi where she could not acknowledge/answer what ANet could do to prevent the abuse in the first place. It seemed she, and I'll wager most of ANet, believe the playerbase is **solely** responsible for the feedback we give because we are the ones who spoke out at the end of the day. But there are environmental/policy issues that ANet could improve on: this fact falls on deaf ears. If you don't want mosquitos in your bird bath, take care of the bird bath.
---
If you love the game, you should be concerned just like us.
---
What about you go fucking bitch on somewhere else then?
---
&gt; Why have a content stream that guides people into raids if you are gonna stop releasing raids.
---
Because the people they are targeting haven't done the first 7 wings.
---
Where exactly did i mention anything about "legal standing"?
---
Why would they tell you when radio silence results in less entitled sperg backlash? Maybe if the horde could ask in a civil way without a trove of offended crying and unfunny memes you'd get an actual response.
---
Yeah but that's Anet's modus operandi since launch.
---
They like to fuck over the majority of players because of a few idiots. Remember when they introduced the 500 gold in mail per week cap? It's just been a major inconvenience for the playerbase, in order to punish a few naughty guys.
---
Or the fact that the TP spasms out after placing 3 or 4 orders or offers in a row, in order to prevent "botting" (probably), just to inconvenience the playerbase, in order to punish a few bad apples.
---
Or the whole weekly limit on certain types of content, or diminishing returns for meta farms. They just don't want the few ppl who actually nolife the game to have that much of an influence on anything. They'd rather punish the majority of the playerbase again, telling them how to exactly play the game.
---
This reaction to the backlash falls perfectly into this system. "Punish" the majority of the playerbase by using the overstep-reactions of a tiny minority as a REASON (probably) for why Anet is not communicating with the rest of the playerbase in an appropriate way.
---
yeah its France.. they hate every language which is not french. No need to learn basic english like most people in other countries.
---
You are a special kind of dumb and ignorant of the real world. 
---
It's impressive, really.
---
It was about the Living World:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World
---
Which in season 3/4 included more than just story. As they had hyped it up a month in advance the community had every reason to believe that already known quality of life changes would come in the near future and not "we'll announce more in the coming months".
---
&gt; Well, no I don't think it sends that message at all. 
---
Perhaps not to you, but it certainly has to others. It does not help that this was the *only* significant response to the criticisms of the past couple days. If they had fully addressed the community's concerns AND spoke out against trolls, then I don't think it would have been received negatively, although it still would never have had any *positive* impact. 
---
&gt;I don't think you can reasonably expect an official response before the end of next week.
---
[And yet. . .](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cy1lah/rubis_take_on_the_communitys_reaction/)
---
&gt;"Engaging with the trolls" may not accomplish much, because the internet is a fucked up place, but simply ignoring them to let them have their way at your colleagues isn't a great solution either. 
---
If "engaging with the trolls" *could prevent* "letting them have their way at your colleagues," then sure, definitely, engage away.
---
But it cant.
---
Ever. 
---
Engaging with the trolls will never reduce any trolling. At best is changes nothing, at worst it encourages them, because either consciously or subconciously, they want the reaction, they want the response, they want to know that they've made an impact. Those already involved would redouble their efforts, and new trolls would arrive, having smelled the blood in the water from other parts of the Internet completely unrelated to GW2. "There are people here who are reading troll posts and are bothered by them!"
---
&gt;Personally I think Rubi's response is spot on. It's reasonable, empathetic and professional. 
---
There's nothing particularly negative about *what* she said, but rather that she said anything *at all.* To paraphrase Thumper's mom, "If you have anything to say about trolls, don't say 'nuthin at all." Again, it can't make anything any better, and can *only* make things worse, no matter how well intentioned, no matter how well phrased. 
---
&gt;And obviously Rubi isn't "afraid of the snakes". Otherwise she wouldn't have posted anything.
---
You missed my point. You can't convince a snake not to bite. If a snake bites you, you can't deliver a calmly worded speech that would prevent the snake from biting again. **The snake is going to bite.** If you're a public facing figure, you have to accept that snake bites will occur, and just accept that as part of the job. It's not fair, it would be lovely if we could prevent that from being the reality of the situation, but wishing it were different does not make it so. 
---
&gt;Sure snakes are gonna bite. People are gonna abuse you and your colleagues and friends. So let's just accept the fact.
---
Exactly. There is *literally* nothing else one can do about it.
---
WvW is great. Thousands of players play it every week and have a great time doing it. There are lots of exclusive rewards to WvW and plenty of people choose to play it as a specific way to farm rewards they can obtain in another part of the game. As others in this thread have said, it's one of the best versions of large scale combat in any MMO.
---
Honestly don't pay attention the pessimism on the sub atm. Plenty of people are happily playing WvW right now. It's a fantastic game mode and I strongly recommend you try it out.
---
have to say the entire event was hyped up for no reason - when the Anet team spends days hyping it up to only release the next living world and 1-3 other small things i can see why they are annoyed!
---
&gt; How is that any different from a vast amount of other industries though?
---
There's no unions within game development. It's common for companies to hire workers for a project, and then do mass layoffs when the project is either done or is beginning to slow down.
---
Couple that with crunch time where you have people working upwards of 100 hours per week, then yeah, it's a shitty fucking industry to work in.
---
I'm a business application developer, I develop applications that aid various automobile related companies in sales, data management, and marketing. It's not the most exciting line of work, but I chose to enter business application development over games development purely because of how piss-poor the game dev working conditions are.
---
&gt; ArenaNet attempting to play a victim card to ignore the criticism of their customers. 
---
That's not the case at all. Step back, cool your head, and look at what they're actually saying. If you need assistance with that, they're saying "please don't harass our developers, they're people too."
---
People are acting like entitled Karens screeching at retail employees.
---
&gt; I personally spent may, june and july with a notice hanging over my head. It was luckily rescinded and panned out well for me. However, six coworkers in my team got laid off.
---
And you've learned nothing in the process. Well done.
---
Its a competitive mode, so there will be less hand-holding and more expectations. Guild exist to teach you, and so do endless youtube videos. Playing as a clueless solo player is not what was intended for wvw
---
Yes, because of the "no downstate" mode, they had to go safer
---
&gt;starting right now you buy PoF  and get core game, HoT and PoF for one price.
---
Starting right now implies that is going to stay that way even later? not sure If I should try the Free-Game first, or rush and buy the expansions because of this maybe-temporary sale?
---
&gt;Season 2,3,4 can be bought in gemstore for 200 gems per episode(roughly 2£).
---
Is just currently like so because of in-game sale? or that's a fixed price? Is there any thing that currently in sale due to the "Anniversary" sale that I should get now instead of two months into the future when there's no sale? (less interested in cosmetics).
---
The annoying thing about JP fiasco is that there is an issue of sexism for female devs in the industry, its just JP cried wolf and never backed down, making women legitimately speaking out about actual problems get lumped in with her nonsense.
---
If you don't like the subreddit, then leave.
---
Yes, that is opening story from core game launch. Season 1 was happening right after end of Personal Story timeline wise
---
Why? It's a saga, part of the LW, not an expansion.
---
Only when an expansion was released, character select screen and so changed.
---
Anet loves to play the victim. They brought the hate to themselves. I'd personally love to see Mike Z replaced, not because I dont like him as a person, but because I think he's doing a shit-tastic job.
---
The games direction is all over the place, not focused on jack dittly squat. 
---
They are just stringing us along, collecting those gem store sales. THAT'S what makes people upset.
---
When I said before hand this announcement wasn't for us, I got shouted down here. No one believed me, so I stopped talking about it, but I believed then, as I do now, that this was about getting new players, not talking to us. They didn't need to rent a theater at a con to talk to people already playing. That was my belief then and I said so.  I agree it was handled badly but I knew prior that this is what would happen and I said so.  I sort of did expect them to announce elite specs, though, but I wasn't holding my breath for them either.
---
They dont have to talk to you or anyone else. Entitled much?
---
Well, I don't enjoy PvP - and being a fresh father - I can't see myself going into raids because I can't guarantee 100% up time (baby crying for example). So for the Solo experience, it seems just about right :-)
---
It's dolyaks arch now.
---
Order of Whispers if FC Liverpool.
---
Wtf world do you live in?  We absolutely should be insulting the people doing this garbage.  At very least they have no integrity or spine.  
---
People SHOULD be judged for your actions.  Dont wanna be called a pos?  Dont act like a piece of fucking shit cause Im not going to pretend you smell like roses and feed your delusions.  
---
Wanna be treated with respect and kindness?  Dont fuck me over first.
---
The twohundredfiftenth thread with a variation of "things that would have made me happy: especs... " or "we demand better communication, we are the customers after all!" on the other hand is a tressure trove of never before seen insights and productive discourse.
---
Yes, personal story from base game is the start. Also, there are story dungeons that are in parallel with personal story, those are best played once you get level for them (if you do story in a same way, aka play lvl 30 dungeon when you do lvl 30 story)
---
Sadly this is the issue, a lot of people who speak out to the criticism and backlash and taking Anet's side are people who are like you and play casually and mostly open world, so in their eyes it's all gold and perfection and woop more content! But I have played this game since one of the first beta's in April 2012 or maybe it was even earlier than that, so for us veterans that played all this time to have this sort of stuff come out at a big reveal event it's just flat out disgusting.
---
I don't agree with attacking individuals at Anet or players cause I know it's not their or the developers fault, they are just told what to do and they do it, but the higher ups needs to hear that this shit isnt ok, even EA and Activision/Blizzard, Ubisoft and Bethesda on top of many other game developers / publishers that have done the same shit for years have figured this out and are doing something about it, and they are massive money greedy corporations. 
---
I've want to keep playing so bad, I log on in hopes of thinking "Hey lets do some WvW, oh wait it's completely dead..." and same goes for PvP, I get matched with the same 5-10 players every game no matter if I'm decayed to bronze or pushed to platinum, always see the same people. And the PvE content is getting stale, you can only run an idea so many times before people start losing interest, and this being "expansion worthy content" ain't even close to being true from what was shown, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that it'll be grand. But waiting 3-4 months for every episode only to complete it in less than 1 hour is just awful. At least when HoT and PoF came out I played for a month plus both times before even getting close to deathly boredom, but at least WvW was alive enough to take my mind off PvE for a while when waiting for new content, but that doesn't happen anymore.
---
And the whole "BUY OUR MERCH, LOOK WE HAVE NEW MINI FUNKY POPS AND MORE CLOTHES WOOP WOOP" was just a fat spit in our faces. And this is all being brushed off by the casual community cause "Well I AT LEAST HAVE STUFF TO DO!" So clearly nothing is wrong right, and we are just toxic crybabies? This is why people are upset, cause they paid for this game years ago and want it to thrive cause they really love/like this game, and they are being told by the community to piss off cause they are annoyed with this lackluster reveal.
---
This isn't an attack on casuals, without them the game wouldn't be, but if they now have so much stuff to do why would it bother them so horribly much if the veterans finally got shown some love, we after all are a part of the community too.
---
PLEASE LOVE OUR GAME
---
Anyone who disagrees is WRONG and TOXIC
---
Well I agree dynamic events take more effort than typical quests, but that  is just an excuse, because it is (or rather should be) only a very small part of the content, features and systems they are producing in an MMORPG.
---
&gt;That is not to say anet definitely needs to give some love to PvP and wvw asap, they most certainly do but it didn't fall within the scope of a ls reveal.
---
It does not fall in the scope of a normal LS story reveal, but when you state you are having "expansion type content" with Living Story and put on a special event, then peoples expectations change, now if people's expectations were way out (which it seems they were), then your company is not doing a very good job on the promotion front, because you will end up with a shitstorm.
---
As for definitely need to give PvP / WvW some love, they are way past it that is the problem, they started alliances about 2 years ago, games add entire new modes in less time than that. So basically Anet are being dishonest by saying virtually nothing other than "we are working on it" every 9 or so months, they either have barely anyone on it or are simply stringing people along will come out with BS like they had to cancel is for technical reasons.
---
&gt; With all the flak anet get they're actually more open then others.
---
LOL, no they aren't, take ESO as we mentioned that, their stated schedule is 3 DLC and a chapter (basically a mini expansion) per year, meanwhile Anet kept HoT quiet for so long they lost huge numbers of players because they were diverting resources to producing HoT and the rest of the game was being neglected. And guess what they didn't learn from that.
---
Another difference in the way many other games (including ESO) are more open is that they have a PTS, Anet on the other hand stick to their secretive ways.
---
It is also telling how different companies handle big issues that the playerbase have, so in GW2 players in most of the game (i.e - outside of LS) have had issues with how long features / content takes to be produced and that they are basically given nothing bit platitudes of "we are working on it", which obviously has culminated in the car crash this thread is about. Anet basically say "talk to the hand".
---
Where as to take ESO as an example, they too have issues, one of which was performance, but after a while they actually responded with details, so gave this 'roadmap' for performance - https://i.redd.it/44g55xqmgwc31.png .
---
I get more information on products from companies that I am not even a customer of, than I get from Anet a company I've given my money to, they are a disgrace and a fine example of why the gaming industry has the bad reputation it does.
---
Nah man the story is kinda trash
---
Nothing to do with what I said, but okay.
---
Desert highlands love the mix of desert to mountains really nice place.

So then tell us that

The lore **was** established that they were genderless. It was established back in 2011. Its why the wiki articles have used "it" instead of he or she for all ED but Kralk (not sure about Mordremoth but that should be "it" too). And Kralk is only given him because he's called Glint's father as of PoF.
---
Rather than a political move, it seems more like using modern social terminology. I see no special motive behind his word choice.
---
And it really wouldn't be too far off from that political movement of gender fluidity. If "high dragons" are of single gender (thus are a "non-binary gender"), then being called male, female, or neither is their choice.
---
The only ones making a relation to political and social issues are the community. Tom was asked a question, and he answered.

They did in the presentation it just doesn't feel that way because they had so little to show but they put all their cards on the table.

My Charr unfortunately have finished the Chapter 1-3 so unfortunately the OG Rylock is not in his office but I do have a Screenshot of his "new model" (since apparently he got a reworked face after he lost his Blindfold"

The eyebrows are the only thing I found didn't matched exactly. Also the hair is a bit more reddish, but it is a light effect variation, just go with what you think fits the most.
---
Right. I think it's fine to have ways to get new players to *try* a little WvW, and if they make big changes to the mode it's fine if the have incentive for veteran players to give it a fresh try, but these things should be fairly quick and easy to accomplish, so if you aren't having any fun, you can leave and still get your doorbuster gift. Anything that would take weeks or more to accomplish, they need to have alternate ways to earn them.

I've been playing this game since pre-release and only recently started frequenting this subreddit, but OH MY GOD this is an actual bot command?? Fuck that's amazing.

Have an upvote just because I genuinely don't think anyone else on this sub would have a clue the fuck you're talking about. Or they'd downvote you if they did.

Yes, It is.

It's to guide people who **don't currently do raid** into raids.

Why do you think that anyone would stick around a subreddit of a game they don't like??

Just to be clear: this discussion is about you pretending to have a quaggan blue mug?

IF you are looking for a new mmo, gw2 is a great game to start atm, because many others will so too.

If you are looking for a newsubreddit to hang out in, there are probably better ones around atm.

Yes and no. We got megaservers, so the roleplaying servers got mixed up with all the other servers. That naturally kind of nuked the communities. They re-organized in guilds. You can still join a role-playing server. Servers get grouped together a bit, so when megaservers have to decide on which instance of a map to put you, you might land on one with many others of your server, adding to the chance to ending up with other roleplayers.
---
alright i didn't know that guess I'm off to WoW classic sad day but the writing is on the wall from seems as though the content I'm here for is no longer being supported so ill go elsewhere for it.
---
No, thats not the case at all.  She's asking for the people being disrespectful to stop.  Nowhere is she saying that the community has not raised valid concerns.  You don't have to be "actively looking for the behaviour" to see it, not from her position, because many of the insults are directly aimed towards members of ANet team.  WE have to actively look for them, sure, but if you are DIRECTLY tweeted at you see that shit pretty easily.
---
The job of the person being complained about here is a Marketing Manager.  I doubt they have much cause to look at feedback threads, since they are neither in Community or Development positions.  However not matter WHAT position you are at within a company I would hope that if you see someone actively attacking your colleagues you would stand up and say something about it.
---
Well said. I'm sorry but I don't want to be expected to coddle a game developer. I've been harassed, and death threats and other stupid bs has been directed towards me, sometimes on daily basis when you play games online. Yesterday I was told to "kill myself" in a match of Overwatch. You need to grow a thicker skin and simply DISMISS those trolls, and not let it get to you. Don't play it off as "industry-wide" problem, because guess what, we as players get this sort of treatment a lot, sometimes even on daily basis if you're in the competitive gaming scene. Rise above it, don't pay attention to it, and address actual criticisms.

&gt;	judging from the insane backlash from their transparency
---
No, their ***lack*** of transparency is the primary reason for the backlash. That, and the absolutely disastrous “announcement” event.
---
People are upset because they *massively* overhyped the announcement. Without so much as a clue (lack of transparency) as to what the announcement was for, players were left to speculate and get their hopes up.
---
The “announcement” itself didn’t tell the playerbase anything new. We’ve known for a while now that Season 5 would be coming out next. They’ve already confirmed that build templates would be coming to the game. We already know that the LS episodes are free, and that GW2 doesn’t require a sub. None of that was news.
---
Here are some things players actually wanted to know: What is the long-term plan for the future of GW2? When will the next expansion come out? When are we getting new content (elite specs, weapons, armour, expansion feature such as gliding/mounts, etc)? What are the plans for PvP? WvW? Fractals? Raids? How often can we expect content updates?
---
All of those questions require transparency on ANet’s part. None of the questions were addressed during the event. Instead we got a sneak preview of the next seasons’s lore, a Charr rock band, and some shitty, tacky merch advertisements.
---
It’s their lack of transparency and their being completely out of touch with the playerbase that is now causing people to quit en masse.
---
They could even introduce things that incentivize PvE players to get involved, I know we have exclusive skins but even something like bonuses that flow on into the PvE realm, things like farming bonuses if your world is in front or making the jumping puzzle rewards actually good again and bring in a competitive mode there as well. Little wins like this will freshen existing content and as long as they do it on a consistent basis until alliances are rolled out they will keep people semi-interested.  
---
I know a lot of the hardcore WvW'ers don't want PvE players in "their" area but honestly if you want Arenanet to prioritise it we have to have full queues all the time to show them that gamemode isn't dead.  
---
One of the biggest things is monetization for them I guess, if it's not making money then it's not viable, which from a business standpoint I can understand regardless of the communities desires, especially since they have had to lay off a heap of people recently. I'm not sure how they can even fix this, maybe exclusive BL chests just for WvW? Basically can be opened with normal keys and unlock things like different catapult skins and static fort decorations when you own it that don't affect gameplay?
---
I dont see that on reddit... reddit is pretty wholesome in that regard.

good luck with that they virtually never apologied and hates admitting their mistakes like the pest and rather lose thousand of players, then changing an obvious bad decision...

The claim is that as a percentage of overall comments they make up a minuscule amount.

Its called the vocal minority. Highlighting those comments only adds to the vocal aspect, and is unhelpful.

One of my most favourite places is right in front of a Stronghold North of  Ossencrest Climb, because of the many Cherry Tree's it has combined with the snow falling in the background. A nice location to take some good looking screenshots.

---
You get the living world for free if you are online when the episode is active. If you're not online during this time you can purchase the missing episodes with gems (you can buy gems with money or gold) 
---
Depending on how long you've been gone you might not have Season 2, 3 &amp; 4. 
---
Storywise it's: Personal Story -&gt; Season 1 (not replayable) -&gt; Season 2 -&gt; Heart of Thorns expansion -&gt; Season 3 -&gt; Path of Fire expansion -&gt; Season 4 -&gt; Upcoming "Saga 5" (starting September 17th)
---
So if you care much about story that's the chronological order you'd have to play through it. 
---
If you don't care a lot about the story then Season 3 &amp; 4 add 1 new map (12 total from top of my head) per episode there are also new masteries and eh achievements and skins, legendary stuff etc.
---
Season 4 adds 3 new mounts (Rollerbeetle, Warclaw &amp; Skyscale, for the Skyscale you need all of Season 4)  
---
I do think they're worth it but you could also decide to grind gold ingame and purchase episodes that way, it's way more time efficient to buy them with real money though ;) (I think S2 only adds 2 maps)
---
Said who
---
Don’t be afraid. the game offers new players content and fun for thousands of hours. We veterans are only concernt and vocal about it because we want that this continues for us who already played so long and Anet is not very open about their future plans. I wouldn’t be concerned as new player as the game is far from dead and there are a lot of people playing.
---
And naturally the management is seemingly immune from layoffs and the devs hired to work on those cancelled products have to take the fall for their managers' incompetence.
---
I can't believe you had to edit the post.
---
No they dont but talking and communicating is how business in good faith is done. If people give constructing feedback with no answer back then people get curious or suspicious and soon enough distrustful and it just snowballs from there. Its not that they have to talk or anything,its that they aint allowed to as per management policies.
---
You're delusional if you think GW2 doesn't make as much if not more than, for example, FFXIV.
---
Honestly that doesn't sound like a bad system to me.
---
Freezie?

sorry for the little clickbait but its not wrong ;)

Hermits roost in fields of ruin.

---
They made a stupid mistake that they really should have seen coming. Bethesda literally did the same thing with fallout 76's announcement. 
---
You can't make a hype stream and expect the hype train to not leave the station. Once it does you can't give it nothing and expect everyone to be okay with it.
---
Layoffs and Anet's preservation through them have nothing to do with them not reading the room, and them promising "expansion like features" then hyping it to be this new level of content drop: having a live stream countdown, renting a venue, and then giving us the standard slightly rebranded season 5 while simultaneously missing the mark on what the community wants.
---
Hell, I'm primarily an open world player and even I wanted anything else so there was more endgame content rather than grinding out some more masteries and map currencies.
---
The criticism is warranted and it is childish to deflect it all as all toxic.
---
It is not sure that we all get mixed together. When alliances got initially revealed there was this post:  
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/376988/#Comment_376988  
---
Yes they might drop that like they did now, but that is the reason why players with concerns about this issue should voice them now before the alliance system gets implemented.
---
If you play all episodes and get 100% map completion of every map with a class you unlock the new specialization for this class.

you can find unused skillicons, spec- / traiticons en masse on wiki if you just search for it.  
---
there is simply a lot of unused stuff in the client, maybe added so you do not have to do it later and its easier to put up different colors from the go or whatever the reason was.  
---
simply put: nobody knows. may get used at some point, may get deleted at some point because the color doesn't fit.
---
I think the problem is nobody is making them money. Yeah casuals don't use many of the other services, but they're scooting by with just enough money to make LS releases. I guarantee that despite the awkward merch plug at the end, the big reason for the announcement was to sell the PoF+HoT bundle and get that message out, hopefully hyped, for a cash infusion.
---
I don't know... I guess to give some more ways to gain hero points or something
---
as bad as some people have been, it does not excuse ignoring people who arent being toxic. they are using the toxic minority to justify putting informational carrots on sticks and telling us to shut up and have blind faith for a product that not once in 7 years have they been able to satisfyingly discuss or develop in regards to their own vision, ever changing as it seems to be. if not a single higher up comes out to do something about this situation by the 17th, then i have no faith that they care about anything beyond making us think there is something worth spending more money on to support. this game has been treated like its on its last legs since HoT, no matter how they try to approach it, they just keep failing with the community engagement on nearly every level except when to prevent negative spiraling, which could be prevented in the first place by just being more transparent. they have been lying for 7 years now about their desire to be more transparent. it just goes back to the same every time. they dont care. they are not our friend. i thought they were more passionate than just wanting to make believe that The Table is bigger than it actually is, or will ever be. i have spent countless hours in this game and gotten thousands of hours of enjoyment out of it. but the community engagement, and the way they treat the non-toxic portion of the playerbase, has not once in 7 years been anything short of the ultimate insult
---
Well they could take queues from their fractal system, which is vertical progression as you need to augment your gear for higher levels of agony. They could do something like that, specifically for raids, where your gear is the same but you're upgrading a socket or something. 
---
However, that system is still boring. Players want that physical piece of gear to drop, that not only improves stats, but augments their character's appearance.
---
I mean it would be in line with the "pay for convenience" idea of GW2's monetization. But I would appareciate if less well-off (IRL) people would have at least 1 free slot.
---
Well they kinda said they will support languages with the alliance system:  
---
Yes that might change like it did now with the removal of the language-restriction, but thats exactly why people should voice their concerns now. I also understand the problem OP has. It's pretty muuch the same problem(maybe not that extreme) for german servers. It does not affect me but I know people who it does.
---
They ARE doing their job but YOU don't like what they're working so hard on.
---
This is entirely on YOU, not ArenaNet.
---
In the hypothetical event that LWS5 launched with new specs, I don't know if I would be more or less upset at this awful announcement
---
I'd be surprised if we actually went through the Saga without bloody elite spezialisations. Considering that Anet announced next to nothing, I'd think that it's safe to say that they did not announce what they're planning on releasing during their Saga.
---
Of course there *is* the off chance that they have nothing announced because they have nothing released, but we got seven years of content delivery behaviour that point in another direction. So yeah, it's almost a given that we're going to get stuff. Including elite specs.
---
I'd really want to know where exact are you seeing all this toxicity. I've on the sub since the announcement and nothing toxic makes it past 1 upvote.

Yeah, I saw the “free” expansion in their site, nice time that I chose to return eheh 
---
Btw, do you know if the Deluxe edition is worth over the standard one? It doesn’t look like since the only really useful thing is the character slot
---
That has nothing to do with the fact that I've gotten literally thousands of hours of entertainment from a high quality product and I haven't even spent $1000.
---
I'm just not poor so throwing $50 at something that I enjoy for years every now and than doesn't bother me, and I'm financially literate enough to know I get more than the value of what I'm paying and I don't even have to pay anything if I didn't want to.

Hello, active roleplayer here and guild officer here.  
---
Best place to start is here, for certain.  [https://www.guildwars2roleplayers.com/forum](https://www.guildwars2roleplayers.com/forum)   
---
The answers to your questions also largely depend on if you're EU or NA. I'm personally on EU, in which player counts are less, and open-world RP is a little sparse. Guilds still chug along as usual, however, and that's where you'll probably find the best stuff - in guilds.   
---
On EU, open world RP is mostly in Divinity's Reach and Amnoon - you'll want to be on Piken Square server, or know someone to taxi you. The meta-RP guild is Wandering Roleplayers.  
---
On NA, open world RP is also Divinity's Reach, specifically Salma and Rurikton. You'll want to be on Tarnished Coast.   
---
The meta-RP guild is Tarnished Coast Roleplayers.  
---
Good luck!
---
&gt; and reddit too was a toxic swamp right after
---
Can you link me a couple of the "toxic swamp" posts you're speaking of? Because I've been here since the announcement, everyone keeps claiming that reddit was toxic, yet everytime I ask them to link some of that toxicity they misteriously go silent.
---
Given the recent layoffs it should have been obvious to everyone that an expansion was not on the table. It's a minor miracle that they recovered enough to do anything much really, so soon after the last season. So the disapointment for me is that it is difficult to see a way forward for GW long term without some expansion or a Guild Wars 3. And if the former is not possible, then the latter most certainly is not feasible, without a massive injection of funds, which NCSoft have strongly indicated will not be forthcoming.  I would hope that whatever happens they build on the existing game and content this season rather than feel they have to add lots of new small maps as in previous seasons. But, overall the presentation did not leave a positive impression for a game I have a strong attachment to. But, all other studios seem to be capable of is switching the clock back a decade and a half to better times for MMOs. Maybe these games and their players are all dinosaurs... but it would be nice to have at least one last roar.
---
I've been assuming ArenaNet just don't know what they're doing anymore. No ones actually in charge, and everything can change at a moments notice. Yes it's miraculous any content get's developed to the quality levels they produce, but their competition has grown and evolved with the times. At this point the level of trust between player and dev is probably at an all time low, and rather than try to fix that from their end, they're attacking players. And worse still these "toxic insults" get's brought up multiple times like OP points out, it feel like those that didn't act maliciously are just being grouped with them even though the majority are being VERY civil, all things considered. 
---
Let's talk about criticism, or how Anet see it, kicking a dev while they're down. It's like Tim Schafer's Double Fine, Tim decided to set up shop in one of the most expensive living areas in the USA. That's fine, he pays his staff decent wages, but the cost of development is now x2 what it would of been if he set up somewhere cheaper. Should Double Fine be applauded for being able to produce content even though their development costs are over inflated thanks to Tim liking west coach beaches? Fuck no. They are held to the same standards and comparisons of other developers producing games all over the planet, it's up to Tim to make sure that while he's over spending on wages, that the quality of staff will increase because the living area is more attractive. 
---
That's business management 101, and honestly I feel like Anet are just a bunch of Liberal Art Majors that want to just have the game speak for itself, that's fine but your not going to build a strong community that way. Honest advice to Anet, grow up. Stop acting like you're a company of young hippies making a game for the love of it. Stop acting like you've never read a message board before, we've all seen deplorable shit on the internet before. Ignore it like an adult and move on. Because your a game development company, your not a person, you don't have feelings to hurt as much as you like to think you do, that's just you.
---
I wouldn't mind new faces, this one included, in the makeover kits. Both for norn and charr
---
No. If they had something to say, they would have said it it. Because they needed it desperately. Even if new elite specs were just confirmed somewhere in the future, with job not being done even on the paper (like wvw alliances). So right now you can safely assume that nothing, literally nothing exists on the new elite specs.
---
Why do they introduce the new ones? Well, with the focus on getting new players it would be logical to give them a way to unlock old elite specs while playing new content.
---
by popular demand, like hearts.
---
Don’t you think Anet would have mentioned it by now if that was the case?
---
No, I think they would have at least hinted at it this point. 
---
With that being said, I do think that we will get an expansion after this LS season. The narrative team hinted towards something big after the Saga when they were speaking at the announcement event.
---
The hero challenges in Maguuma and the Crystal Desert were [green](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hero_challenge#Map_icons). The ones in PoF could have been red/purple (PoF’s color) but for UX/UI consistency sake they remained green.
---
I continue to think that if Elite Specs were a feature planed for soon, they would have said so in the saga’s official announcement conference. It’s not really a feature you ignore considering its importance.
---
These also appeared quite early in the game’s file, way too soon for something that wasn’t even announced.
---
I could see these being extra hero points you can work for as an alternative to PoF and HoT maps. I have tons of characters that only have one specs because I didn’t want to go through the hassle of doing HoT’s challenges for example, so these could be an alternative.
---
This is Human Behaviour 101.  Human nature is to notice criticism far more easily than praise.  
---
And she's not "highlighting" the negative comments, afaik she hasn't directly called out any specific comment.  She's just asking that all criticism be raised in the correct manner, and doing so with insults is not the way to do it.
---
This conversation between community and ArenaNet has nothing to do with outside people. Hyperbole statements are statements you're not meant to take seriously to begin with. They just outline what exactly the issue is by overexaggerating it. 
---
Sure, in some cases you really should not use hyperbole, but in this context it matters next to nothing. If the statement actually affects the dialogue then sure, however, I don't think it's a far stretch to say that companies (including ArenaNet) do encourage people to spend a high amount of money on the game due to predatory business models that aim to do exactly this. In that sense, what the guy is saying about 200-300 bucks a month isn't actually very far away from the truth.
---
I didn't say it was *realistic,* just that it would definitely *help.* ;)
---
Designing hot topic tshirts.
---
It does have a language sorting though:  
---
Yes, they might remove that like they did now. But guess why peopple should be upset now and voice their concerns: So that A-Net might consider their opinion while developing alliances.
---
&gt; But i would say raids are pretty certain.
---
If they are so certain, Anet should simply state that they are indeed planning to make another raid.  But they just had a big hype event where they rented a theater to tell us the future of the game, and they specifically did not tell us that raids were in development (also fractals not mentioned either).  
---
To me I would say it is quite certain, wing 7 was the last raid.
---
Fast and brutal!
---
That guy really makes me think of that creepy beast in the movie Annihilation. Quite litterally a mind-blowing film by the way.
---
Vertical progression requires both casuals and hard core players to reach the new max gear cap. So it artificially increases the playtime. It can lock this gear behind gates as well (faction reputation, story or raid completion) all of which slow down the trek to the new end tier.
---
Gw2 doesn't have any of that. The moment new repeatable content (be it fractals or Raids, or a pvp map) comes out you're ready to go for it.
---
Thought you meant that tweet from 2 days ago or so, but you mean the one from Rubi?
---
Yeah, I agree. The way she writes the tweet is somewhat offensive to the community as it broadcasts to the world that we're all full of insults, hitler metaphors and threats.
---
you assume they are paid based on % of generated revenue, while it can be fixed amount set up every year depending on KPIs.
---
No unions within game development you say? I guess the one I was apart of when I worked the industry for a decade was a unicorn then. I think you are conflicting the industry with the norms of your "shithole country".
---
Now, that is not to say it isn't an industry that can be shitty to work in. **However, no one said it isn't. I simply said that** ***it is a better industry to work in than many of the industries in which the players they are adressing work*****.** They are after all trying to solicit sympathy from those players and I'm pointing out how that is out of touch.
---
I also made the argument that talking about the games industry is impertinent to this thread, though you keep bringing it up with some fascination about it (if you develop phone apps, maybe try Blizzard? heh). This thread, in which the OP is calling ArenaNet out for trying to divert the wave of criticism by playing to our emotions - all while being so emotionally dettached that they can not see that they are complaining about potentially losing their jobs or how their friends lost their jobs, to *people who have already lost jobs*. Then they complain about a lack of sympathy even though they themselves are lacking the sympathy needed in order to understand the players behaviour. If you're the VP of marketing, it is your god damned job to have your fingers on the pulse of these things.
---
No one here is arguing for that abuse is okay, either privately or in an official capacity, from some sort of moral standpoint. We're simply pointing out that most people face abuse in their place of work if they do public work and dealing with it professionally is part of being a professional. The way they are acting now is not professional.
---
Also, I don't think people are upset with Ruby or Brian for riding out to their colleagues defense or calling them brave (however nonsensical that is). I think people are upset because Ruby and Brian riding out to their colleagues defense is garnering more attention than the expected "We know we fucked up, we know we're reprising our problems even though we promised a change and this is how we intend to make up for it going forward" communication that is expected. You see, they know they did fuck up, Stephane's attempted damage control with the PvP communities suggests as much, it is just that it is lacking the necessary force and proactive reassurance that is required. "We know that you are angry and we may potentially speak on the matter sometime in the future" just doesn't hold the same ring to it, does it? 
---
For further notice: my head is completely cool. I wouldn't be here, trying to communicate in earnest, writing full paragraphs in where I am constructing solid arguments and exposing you for running out of arguments where you are turning to insecure and petulant projections if I wasn't cool :).
---
Anyway Karen, best of luck getting into the gaming industry in the future. It is not as bleak as painted, everywhere. Perhaps consider a career abroad?
---
Got em from the Blizzard store, they're on sale now too! https://gear.blizzard.com/us/overwatch-d-va-bunny-leggings-by-wild-bangarang
---
&gt; while a good point, i dont think it would go over too well. even best case scenario that episodes are every 3 months, it will take a year and a half or more for all. if someone mains a class or two and it takes a year for them to get their elite specs, theyd be spazzing out like crazy knowing gw2's playerbase.
---
Why not change it then to releasing a single traitline for all elites per release?
---
That way anet has to do 1/3rd of the work, and all players are happy since no one is left out.
---
Are elite specs not "Expansion worthy content"?
---
Np, to get into end game the only time efficient and fun option is by joining a guild that does either training runs or has a static that is willing to teach. Joining a pug is rather hard since you probably don't have killproofs. But once you get into a static raid clears on one or two days are very reasonable.
---
I dunno. I've seen a lot of unmoderated criticism on the forums lately.
---
Dunno, norn with Scar face would look weird.
---
First of all
---
&gt;No, that is not actually what they said. They said "expansion-WORTHY content", which has a completely different meaning to what you said.
---
No it doesn't, quit your bullshit.
---
And second of all, are elite specs not "Expansion worthy content"?
---
Are you taking about the boss that's being introduced in the Prologue or in Episode 2? Because they clearly showed off the boss for the Prologue during the event- it's the giant ice elemental that'll change during Episode 1 to match the change in tone. If you're talking about Drakkar, then you won't see it until episode 2, which is anywhere between 4 to 6 months away depending on if they can get back to their 2 to 3 month release cadence.
---
You'd be surprised, that's a lot of people on this sub who just stay here to make fun of it despite already quitting
---
For new player, this game is best offer on the market. You need to understand that complaints are mostly written by 7 year old veterans and they don't apply to your situation. Come and play, the game is magnificent and I wish I could erase it from my memory only to start over again with fresh mind.
---
The Wintersday Raid
---
&gt; They're made by people who would not only know that most players complete the Story chapters, and also know the reasons why they might, but also know how many players don't play WvW, PvP, or Fractals (or raids, which you left out, which was appropriate to the amount of people who play that).
---
Have you ever checked glassdoor reviews? You basically climb the ranks at Anet by marrying into the management and it's full of people who don't know what they're doing.
---
i mean you would just amplify the amount of effort required. how do you approach it? what if an elite spec has an useless first third?
---
not to mention, the problem *isnt* the flavour and the balance. its the skills, animations, new ascendant weapons, collections, etc.
---
Your home instance is kind of the same thing... But there's a lot of current event stuff which is 1x per character that I'm not sure you can ever unlock with another character.
---
A trophy room thing could be cool, but at the same time I really wouldn't care about it all that much if I'm being really honest :V
---
oops I forgot to edit that. thanks for noticing.
---
Crystal Oasis down by the beach, especially at night!
---
Say, how often do they have to tell you before you get the message though.
---
I mean we're now after 2 seasons of simplistic story segments in underdeveloped zones. Sure, there's always blips of greatness, in the odd feature like the Skyscale, the map visuals of Draconis Mons, in the story of Daybreak.  
---
But every one of them there's a full hand of other mediocre things which are also just rote as hell in their design
---
Last time wvw gave good rewards things didn't end well.
---
Basically what it boils down to is that both sides are getting tired of each other's shit. The only difference is one side has to do a thing for a living, and the other is just consuming said thing.
---
Why are you people allways saying "taking our money"? 
---
There isn't a subsciption and every $ you spend is on your own free will. :p
---
A company allways spends money on more then just the game where it came from, that's normal. O.o
---
We live in Tyrian society.
---
Honk Honk
---
Its not in fact uncommon for one programmer to take two years on some big feature. The native mac client also took forever. Diablo II's infamous 1.10 patch also took years for a similar reason.
---
Its true we don't know what is going on or if or when to expect anything, but if you allocate a tiny team its not unreasonable for it to be worked on for ages before seeing the light of day.
---
Thats why I got fired by NCSoft.
---
She worked there until the layoffs earlier this year though. And considering the state of the forums her views and approach hadn't changed much.
---
While we're at it, please add hair to it too!
---
&gt;I don't think it's unrealistic to expect them to at least tell us what makes sagas special and different fron Living World. 
---
Yeah, that'd be nice. My working assumption is just "we changed the word." It's marketing spin and nothing more. Maybe there is more to it than that, and if so, then they probably should have done some more explanation of that. At this point, I'm not expecting anything bigger than what we got out of LWs4, and realistically, probably a bit less in terms of actual gameplay changes. 
---
Actually, one workflow change I'd really LOVE to see them make is to split off "Plot" and "story" a bit. Have "Plot" episodes equivalent to what we're used to, the big story chapters with combat content, new maps, rewards, etc., but then also, in between those (not spreading them thinner, just in the periods that would normally contain nothing at all), they could have purely "story" chapters, where you can visit NPCs and trigger cutscenes that expand the story, but without having to add new maps or combat encounters. Just maybe a half hour or so of content that doesn't specifically relate to the plotline in progress at the moment. 
---
Like one thing that's disappointed me about the story of this game is that since HoT started there have been some massive world-changing events, but we haven't often enough checked in with characters like Jory and Kas, with the various world leaders, etc., because they haven't been directly relevant to the core plotline of the moment. I'd like to have those scenes happen, where we find out what they've been up to, and how they are reacting to major world changes that have been happening.
---
I'm kind of hopeful that things like the "prologue" might fit into that category.
---
Also she just stopped working there earlier this year, how is that "quite some time"
---
I'm not hardcore but I've maxed all classes, and then some. Do note that there are casual players who have played for years, so maxing all classes is not something only hardcore players are able to do. The gist is that this announcement is overhyped+nothing new is announced, where else other MMOs are constantly coming up with new and interesting stuff, even wow is listening to player feedback. Granted, my opinion is that the no sub model is doing gw2 no favours...
---
I remeber shaman have once datamined it as a skin.
---
Imagine getting stealth removed by payroll.
---
You cant run a business like that, being spiteful like 9 year old and trying to sell a product dont go together.
---
The purple storm place in dredgehaunt ^^
---
Toxic people: "I act like people talk about legit concerns brought forth in a respectful and constructive manner when they talk about toxic destructive shitstains acting like rabid baboons on the forums."
---
You know arcdps?  
---
It allready has an addon that gives you build templates + gear templates and automatically swiches out your gear with the one in your bag.
---
So what you discribe as undooable is basically what most people that play instanced content are allready dooing if they play classes that can have multiple roles.
---
There's a ton of RP in rata sum. I used to afk there on the crafting floor, and there's some wild shit in chat there.  
---
Also ran into furry RP in sparkly fen, but that was a one time thing(hopefully......)
---
You will never change anyone's mind here. Toxic bastards hide behind legit concerns when called out for toxic bastards. Of course they do. Sadly, that immensely weakns people with *actual* legit concerns who are a decent enough human being to name their issues in a constructive and at least somewhat polite manner. Because they don't actually care about being constructive, they just wanna be destructive.
---
Is it a museum or science facility? I'd like to visit it xD
---
Working hard in one area of the game is not an excuse to ignore telling people why you won;t work hard on another area. I want to know WHY they won't do anything about dungeons, fractals, pvp, wvw, at this moment in time. Their actions over the years speak to these questions, but every year, they say that they are going to speak to these actions instead of just making us wait to see the actions themselves, and that STILL hasn't happened to the degree they have repeatedly promised. I love this game, thats why I support it. If I only cared enough to log in to snag something I don't have to pay for, so I can something to do later, then where is all the money for their game coming from? From people who care more than that, from people are more concerned than that.
---
Didn't earning drop 33-25% from last year Q1/Q2 compared to this one? 
---
You can take a look at those numbers now instead of pushing the conversation off away to next year.
---
as long as there is no official confirmation its 0 just like with raids and fractals
---
If arcDPS can do it, I should fucking hope official template  can.
---
I didn’t describe it as undoable, I described it as only something important to a small part of the community. I think a lot of people will expect it to be more than it actually is.
---
I've never believed that build templates were as important a feature as certain vocal elements of the community make them out to be.
---
I'm too poor ingame for build templates to mean really anything to me.
---
&gt; i mean you would just amplify the amount of effort required. 
---
It would literally cut it by 2/3rds.
---
&gt; how do you approach it? 
---
By only releasing one traitline per release.
---
&gt;what if an elite spec has an useless first third?
---
What if an elite spec is completely useless? *cough scrapper cough* Never stopped them before.
---
&gt;not to mention, the problem isnt the flavour and the balance. its the skills, animations, new ascendant weapons, collections, etc.
---
Yes making games is hard. That's why we pay them money to do it.
---
I'm the only one that doesnt care about housing at all?
---
Or their choice of 10 of the lowest selling gem store skins.
---
Can you give me an example of something that is expansion worthy content but not an expansion's worth of content?
---
GW2 is more like a permanent cocoon. GW1 has been on life support for a very long time, but GW2 is still getting updates.
---
It's possible that they would want to get us out of the desert theme and more into the icy atmosphere.
---
I believe adding content and events such as jormag themed meta to existing maps and world bosses as an event at the end of that meta lets say as an expansion to an existing map could be a really nice tie in. E.G let the claws of jormag or other dragon champions start appearing in other areas, even if its a 3 week event pre-release, it could be like a standard mode strike preview that has been toned down until you actually defeat them during the release, it could be more like a, fend.these things off for now. Throw two new weapon skins and an armor skin in as a rare drop with amalgamated gemstone for daily completion just for those 2 to 3 weeks leading up. I dunno.
---
I remember when HoT was announced. I barely just started in gw2 I was soooo hyped that my classes would changed dramatically. I watched the videos on elite specs at least twice each, and when HoT came I had some much unlocking the classes with HP trains and traversing the jungles. Not to mention the metas... Auric basin, TD and DS metas were so fun and unique to play. Doing multimap AB metas for dat phat loot... 
---
And then came PoF with it's mounts! The mount animations were and still are the best in the entire game industry. I have quit gwW and am loving ffxiv now, but gw2 mounts are the greatest. So lifelike and amazing. The maps weren't as great as HoT but it was still great fun unlocking the mounts and once again getting new elites. The elite specs in this game are so UNIQUE. Ffxiv classes are fantastic but they are built on decades of final fantasy games. 
---
Chronomancer, mirage, dragon Hunter, holosmith, tempest, Weaver... No other game in any genre can come close in terms of class aesthetic and uniqueness.
---
I'm sorry but the staff layoffs was a sure sign of gw2 going into maintenance mode. The game is still great for people who have never played it but for gw2 vets... 
---
Everything has become stale and new LWs is not gonna save it because gw2 does not a very endearing story, nor are it's characters as loveable as other games. Elite specs, map design, raids, fashion wars and mounts were what made gw2 so unique and fun. Maybe WvW/PvP for some folks but it's obvious anet does not have the resources or even the intent to focus on gw2's strengths. The b2p model does not help anet's pockets at all, when comparing against WoW and Ffxiv.
---
It's a pity, but gw2's glory days are over.
---
I had already quit for ffxiv months ago, after the news of the layoffs.
---
Given the clarification tweets (assuming you're talking about Rubi's tweets) - It's not Rubi responding as Anet.  It's Rubi responding as Rubi.  Whether you believe her or not about saying she was speaking to more than just the Aug 30th backlash - that's up to you.
---
Well if a third party tool that some guy does in his free time can swich out traits, skills, equip and change stats on legendary stuff automatically... i think we can at least except a-net to go even on this, can´t we?
---
Just wait for the flood of 'see? fractals and raids were always coming you toxic people!!11!' when episode 3 or 4 gets a single rushed fractal or raid.
---
The game is not lik e WoW and try not comparing those two. I am enjoying both titles equally, each for different things.
---
its more effort cause you need to put thought into each release rather than the entire trait line and be done with it...you cant just release an elite spec that isnt actually a functional spec.
---
&gt;
---
well yeah, we're talking elite specs in free content patches here.
---
Yeah, but the butterfly in this image is representing expansions and by the recent events, it feels like they are going to give us more seasons instead of expansions.
---
I mean 2nd gen legendaries were an actual feature that was supposed to release with HoT. As in, they were literally announced as part of the expansion. It was only after the launch of HoT that they backtracked on that statement. Then they took 3 years to actually implement them. If they had done it before releasing the expansion, that would be fine. But doing it after people already purchased it is just shitty. 
---
And people want Anet to be transparent, not say they're working on something they can't actually do. Very big difference. 
---
My tinfoil hat theory is that Anet has been slowly supporting certain game modes less and less over the years, which is both factual in quality as well as frequency of updates to those game modes, as well as teams for them losing more and more skilled people, fractal and raid team being merged into one, etc. 
---
I'm not making stuff up here, sorry.
---
Always nice to see community events like this!
---
You may also want to consider posting about your event on the forums under the In-Game events section to reach even more people.
---
 [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/categories/in-game-events](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/categories/in-game-events)
---
Maybe if she managed the community better her tirade wouldnt be needed in the first place.
---
That boils down to a difference in the definition of community. In my opinion, not everyone who plays PvP is really a PvPer. A PvPer is someone who plays the game mode activiely who enjoys the mode not just for the rewards but also because they enjoy the challenge and game type. The same can be said for WvW and even raiding, a true Raider doesn’t just enjoy the rewards for raiding, they enjoy the challenge and progression for raiding.
---
Youve hit at a very important topic though, that being that no one who would meet these criteria are left in the game. PvP, like you said, is just full of achievement hunters. The people that still raid only do it for the weekly rewards. Unfortunately, acheivement hunting is not sustainable, eventually everyone has all the achievements completed, and raids get boring. That’s why these communities want more content.
---
We’ve all had fond memories doing something in this game, that’s why we still sit here on Reddit. It just gets really frustrating when people invalidate the gamemodes we enjoy just because not enough other people play them.
---
I’ve watched the event twice and still have no fucking clue what the are doing lol.
---
It sounds like it’s still living story, but less of it, just with the name changed and not calling it living story.
---
I'll say it as someone extremely angry about the announcement; download it, play it, and have fun. You have tons of content to get through and you can go at whatever pace. I doubt the game will be completely abandoned unless they take the servers offline. And I think theres something important to playing through the game once without the expansions. It gives you time to try and learn what your skills do, since the game really doesnt help with that.  
---
But, heres hoping you pick it up and enjoy it! Youve got a long way before you get to the point of angry vets if you start now, dont worry.
---
We seem to have a lot of chinese too.
---
The server merge was REALLY good for the community. Fleet routinely has 5 full instances (imp side). Plenty of active guilds (galactic imperial syndicate is mine and is awesome)
---
It's not as if this was in any way misleading, which you are trying to imply. Everyone knows that ascended armor was a change years back. The OP had no reason to bring it up.
---
Producing content on the current path and generating stagnant revenue and content is not really pushing the game's potential. Games like ESO/FFXIV/PoE/Warframe go strength to strength with big exciting content releases and spikes in interest that draw in new and returning players.
---
i guess theres some degree of dissonance here for me. as an avid player of all those games except warframe, i cant say they go "strength to strength". ff14 is unbelievably stagnant and their content patches arent too interesting if you arent a hardcore raider, eso feels like a watered down version of gw2 in terms of content patches (which arent free btw) and poe is the epitome of quantity&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;quality. they all have their strengths, but so does gw2. i enjoyed dragonfall and the content drops over the summer far more than that miserable excuse of an expansion from eso, or most leagues in poe except the last one. shadowbringer had a very good story that you completed in 10 hours and thats kinda it, not much else other than the good old gear grind.
---
I was linked with german server for god knows how long. Made some friends and joined a german speaking guild. Now i can WvW in a german speaking group. And learning the core stuff takes just few hours. So, maybe the solution  for french players is to join an english speaking guild and ask them to help you learn the basics of WvW terminology? Or maybe just teach them the couple basic words when you encounter a situation like you mentioned. There are propably like 10 words which you need to get the hang of what is going on in WvW, when you omit things that can be ctrl+clicked (game always shows those in your native/client’s language in chat).
---
Most of the europians speak english among their native language. In my country the minimum is native, english + two other languages to make it through the primary school. I know in France you have to learn few other languages too and the same goes with UK, so some form of pidgin language should not be too much to ask for. How about suggesting someone to make english to french cheat sheet for WvW?
---
The Mursaat do not eat bloodstone. As far as we can tell, they do not seem to eat at all.
---
I suspect they are kind of like chak, and they get all their sustenance by consuming magic with the branchiae in their backs.
---
Well there is plenty to do in the story and in the world in general, all at your own pace and time.
---
When your child should require less frequent attention, there is plenty of more challenging content for 5 ppl groups.
---
Fractals they are called, basically classic dungeons with extra steps. They can be done in 15-60 minutes, depending which one and how good your team is.
---
So hope to see you around...
---
I've had similar problems in the past and tried the same solutions as you and also had people say it must be the time, or connection or whatever.
---
I never found a solution, even with trying a VPN it still followed the same pattern. The only thing I found which I think may have helped was closing and restarting the launcher so my speed would often go to 7-12mbps as it starts up instead of 100kbps. Part of that may just be catching up and verifying files where you left off when you closed the launcher ,but I did notice the speed persist for anywhere from 1-20s and I noticed the file count would be dropping fast before the speed just tanks again to a crawl. If you find a solution I'd be interested in hearing it just incase I ever have to suffer this myself again.
---
I'm not sure about other people but I love the overwatch leggings. This is just more things to wear. They look great.
---
Do you have a quote for where that was hinted at? I didn’t catch them mention anything beyond some work in progress stuff for episode two.
---
There used to be more banks and BL merchants around, but they removed them as part of the the "New Player Experience". 
---
As for outposts that still have a BL merchant or bank, the reasoning behind it is obvious for some, but for others it's a mystery.. 
---
* Ebonhawke has them all because it's a city. 
---
* Skrittsburgh has crafting stations because it's a city too, but not having bank may mean there's nobody taking them seriously enough to give them those services.
---
* The Pact settlement by  mount maesltrom may have them because it's far from many cities.
---
* Bitterfrost may have a bank because it's far for civilization, but not a trading post because nothing out there is worth trading where so many animals are now corrupted.
---
Dade looking really safe. I'm in North Broward so we're pretty damn close if it follows the euro model and now it's a 180+ mph cat 5. Getting bit nervous again. Irma wasn't a direct hit but we still lost power for a week and had a tornado hit our house and our neighbors and this sob is stronger.
---
I don't dispute that (btw berserker (HoT espec) is designed with the same approach, so it's not just something that's exclusive to PoF), but they still require skills and core mechanics of the espec to be in place. I'd imagine making traits requires less than half of the development time of the entire specialization. You're still asking for the majority of the work to be done upfront and ready for release, which goes contrary to the argument I was presenting.
---
What if after releasing 1/3rds of the traits the devs would then be unable to come up with the remaining 2/3rds to fit in with the designed mechanics? And they would need to be tweaked or reworked entirely? It's going to be much harder to do that when the spec is already released, when visuals/sounds/animations/UI are done for them, when balancing has already been done on the released one third (possible multiple times even, given the amount of time between LS releases), when players already have emotional attachment to their new fancy toy? And you're expecting them to do that twice to every espec after the tremendous initial effort in getting them all out of the door. That's a disaster waiting to happen.
---
because it's an mmo
---
I understand a large portion of the community is against sub fees.  I know gw2 will never go sub. But people need to understand the consequences.  I love sub games,  even tho I'm broke, for the reasons I've stated.
---
Naive people: "I'm too retarded to see that this is a manipulation tactic to avoid having to respond to criticism so I play right into their hands."
---
Yes! Just like gw2 did when it first released! That's the feeling the devs should chase lol
---
Why wouldn't we know? There's lots of Europeans here and I'm pretty sure many of us know what he means.
---
"Loving this new fractal :) Ignore all the haters, it's nice to have non-challenging content every once in a while"
---
Personally, I would rather Anet balance new raids to the community meta, and actually make them difficult, than continue with the path they’ve been on. We’re going to be playing these builds anyway, why not balance the mode to them?
---
Well you can't have snow without snow banks.
---
&gt; I assume it isn’t a priority because they cannot monetize it.
---
They don't think it's worth putting in the effort to monetize WvW.  Anet, for all their faults, aren't complete fools.  They know as well as us that routes for monetization of WvW exist.  Guild/Server loyalty is something that could be easily turned into $$ --- same with other dumb stuff like skins for Dolyaks, sentries, siege, and whatever the hell else.
---
If you could buy something that turns dolyaks into adorable creatures, but only for yourself, wouldn't you buy it if it were like $3-$5?  I would.  Anet knows that.  
---
The only reasonable assumption is that Anet believes (correctly) that the effort required to create monetized WvW assets is outweighed by the opportunity cost.  Why spend time on a cutey dolyak skin that sells to 3k players when you could create a weapon that sells to 15k?  $$ talks.
---
This seems to be the most reasonable theory.
---
Well, we tried I guess.
---
&gt;  It's definitely more than that and to the point of excess.
---
Can you link me a couple of "toxic abusing" threads then? Surely, if its to the point excess it should be easy to find several of them in the frontpage.
---
I've been harping this the entire time. Everything is still on the table. They just don't have the resources for it. No developer wants to actively remove support for endgame content. Right now however, they're focusing on the casual market. Which is fine.
---
The damage they've done by not stating this simple reality, imo, is much bigger then simply stating that they need to get sagas rolling and out the door consistently before they can allocate more resources to more hardcore aspects of the game. 
---
And I don't mean, bigger as in this past announcement. I mean, bigger as the toll it took on the hardcore community over the past half decade. These players are hemorrhaging, and with it goes (in ANet's terms) the marketing team (lawl). And obviously, other drawbacks that comes with a large vocal minority in a videogame being openly angry, hostile, and critical over the course of years. That damage, imo, is way worse then the fallout they would have had it have now if they just tell us what's going on.
---
that is happening since years on reddit already.  
---
...and on the forums to basically everyone.
---
Just to make sure: it is ironic to you that the worst offenders get deleted by mods doing their jobs. Let's keep that in mind while we talk about how you bring up toxic threads with hundreds of upvotes that no-one but you is talking about when telling people to stop being abusive toxic cunts.
---
On the nose.  If they were working on an expansion, or raids, or other big content releases, the incentives are so strong to talk about it that the silence is compelling evidence that they are not doing those things.  If the living story update every 3-4 months isn't enough for you, move on.
---
Why what is going on in gw2 land?
---
You are aware that Rubi is tweet from her personal account, right? And not in any sort of ArenaNet sanctioned account? 
---
Lets also keep in mind that she has been tweeting about these kinds of things even before the shitstorm a couple of days ago, rather than starting after all of that.
---
Funny thing, I am german and I was in Spain like 15 times? And most (educated) ppl know and understand at least basic english. Not the older generation tho... And it's the same in Spain or Italian. Older generations have problems because at their time it wasn't important (and I understand this) but most young do. But France is just another level. They praise they own language, everything else is meh. Like radio stations aren't allowed playing to much english music (30%ish only afaik)
---
Thing is, there is no 'They' here, this is Rubi's personal Twitter, which is why she's addressing the broader issue of toxicity &amp; abuse directed at devs as an industry-wide issue. This isn't an Anet employee speaking on behalf of Anet, this is one individual expressing her opinion on the broader issue.
---
They are not allowed to respond without approval so don’t expect anything.
---
[Not my experience.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cyayal/people_saying_they_no_longer_feel_respected_by_7/eyqpjbp/)
---
That they don't respond to feedback in a sufficient visible manner or communicate too much *at all* is an entirely different beast and what would go as "legit concern".
---
Uh.. 7 years of same transparency? I mean come on, i remember back in the day they'd engage in reddit conversations, give us some feedback, hype stuff (i miss Colin Sohandsome :( ) and what not but that slowed down after colin left so if I'm not wrong its more like 4years? Not that it makes it much better, but lets be fair to each other :)
---
I assume you mean they *were* important - never played GW1 myself.
---
&gt; Are we having a laugh now? Don't get to attached to a game? Why would you put hundreds or thousands of hours into a game you don't want to get attached to. That's how MMOs work.
---
Thats true, but also not positive.
---
If you didnt enjoy those hundreds and thousands of hours for what they were, rather than as a means to an end, you have a problem.
---
You arent investing your time into anything but your own entertainment.
---
You have no right to receive new content in a game just because you played it a lot or paid a lot.
---
If you think you do, the problem is your attitude and you should probably stop playing multiplayer games for a while, you clearly cant handle them.
---
Everyone is justified in speaking their mind.  And it's my justification to not give a shit and think she is annoying as hell.  Good stuff.
---
It was free in the gem store, not sure if it's still there.
---
so.. when is anet talking about the constructive feedbacks then?

I just read through the front page. There's an abundance of comments calling Anet incompetent, greedy, or saying that they have no plans and are just stringing people along. If you hate capitalism I can see an argument for greedy, but clearly most of the harsh criticisms being lobbed at them are false. The developers and worker bees of ANet are not trying to screw the players over, yet that seems to be what a lot of people are accuaing them of. And yeah, irrational comments like that are pretty hostile and toxic.
---
Because people fear what they don't understand, or like to look down on the other to make up for their own lack in their lives.
---
They should have learned that after 'let's not make an expansion and just do living story season 1 instead!' was a resounding failure.
---
They didn't and tried 'let's not make a 3rd expansion and just do living story season 5 instead!', which was also a resounding failure and led to massive layoffs.
---
Do we dare try this course of action again?  Tune in to find out!
---
I see them every night in Busted Flagon but they talk in French mostly.
---
The community literally voted for the WvW restructure - there were several polls and it was clearly explained at the time that a WvW restructure would take a very long time, the community voted for it anyway.
---
Got'cha. I agree.
---
You can tag the profile as personal as you want, but what's happening is precisely the reason most companies just say to stop using social media publicly if people may think your statements are tied with your company.
---
Remember Peter Fries? He was a good guy overall, but he couldn't stop himself to get into JP's storm back then, and he got hit incidentally.
---
Is it so hard to understand that people do not see your account as personal when you're one of the most known faces of your company?
---
&gt; Just to make sure:
---
Its ironic that you can't actually find any example of abuse. You linked 2 deleted threads, and twitch chat calling a dev fat (OH THE HORROR) as the example of the unspeakable horror that prevents the devs from adressing the community.
---
&gt; Let's keep that in mind while we talk about how you bring up toxic threads with hundreds of upvotes that no-one but you is talking about when telling people to stop being abusive toxic cunts.
---
Because nobody is being an "abusive toxic cunt." I dare you to find even a SINGLE thread that made the frontpage that was "abusive toxic cunt" grade.
---
Fuck it, not even "made the front page", a single thread that wasn't immediately downvoted and deleted. DIck slurpers like acting like "le abuse" is so overwhelming it prevents anet from addressing critisms, but the instant you're callout on it you're having trouble finding an actual example of it.
---
Me too. As much as I think it must be for roleplayers, I think those aren't necessary or add much at all.
---
took me a minute. GG 10/10
---
General public will never see a Twitter profile as entirely personal. There is no advantage to be brought on making those statements knowing they could be misinterpreted. Just think about timing for a second and then convey your thoughts if you care that much.
---
This still makes me smirk every time.
---
I've played WvW since 2012 and I love the mount, I very much wanted one in WvW after playing PvE with mounts. New features in PvE (like gliding and mounts) which are not brought into WvW when they fit (and in my experience mounts do) make WvW feel incredibly bad.
---
Maybe you didn't want mounts in WvW but a lot of people did and are very happy to have them.
---
stop being so abusive. lmao
---
When the community focuses on constructive feedback.
---
LOL
---
In the context of the controversy it's to be expected. Communication is not one way, and there's a lot of noise polluting the message on both ends. So if she reads a single comment in a sea of negativety, it's only going to make that comment seem more negative as well.
---
So she's addressing the timing as a non issue?
---
I am baffled that people still don't understand that much about internet communities and reactions.
---
To be fair we don't know much time will pass until episode 2. Mordremoth from DS was designed in a few months.
---
The difference between optimal comp and a suboptimal comp is only 20%. Maybe a bit more with the chrono stack or mirage confusion exploits but most bosses seem to be balanced around squads that dont even have access to perma offensive boons and decent meta builds.
---
You can 5man gorsevals dps check. Nobody even does the 2 hands spawning on adina and you can even ignore spawning adds on sabir if dps is high enough. It would already help if bosses would be balanced for a standard double chrono double healer comp dps wise.
---
&gt; Is it so hard to understand 
---
Appearently, it is. Sadly, it appears hard to understand for Rubi, too. If she read what I just said she'd probably take it as an attack on topics that are important to her and not realize she sabotages herself the most with what she's currently doing.
---
They wanna change the world, but they'd just have to change their policies.
---
It doesn't paint that picture at all, to me. Nowhere was it said the entire community is engaging in that behavior -- behavior which, by the way, is a lot more common than this thread is claiming. Yes, there are many people simply voicing legitimate concerns, but a *lot* of people are also doing it in an absolutely toxic way that's also inappropriate, IMO.
---
When I read the post, all I thought was "Yes, people who are taking it too far need to chill out", not "OMG ME AND ENTIRE COMMUNITY ARE BEING CALLED OUT!". Anyone who *is* taking it personally probably needs to examine why they're getting defensive about it.
---
Perhaps never. The fact that someone gave constructive feedback does not obligate the receiver to discuss that feedback. Feedback may be constructive while still being pointlessly obvious, outside the scope of discussion, or even completely wrong.
---
You'd think after the last anet people got canned for this they would have a social media policy.
---
"Well this is awkward someone has to change"
---
[Here is the context of trash tier that you coincidentally totally forgot to link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cxx0ki/the_announcement_was_actually_good_news/eyq1r9v/) No worry, it happens!
---
Be prepared!
---
9 months 1 raid wing, every 2 living world episodes new fractal - oopsie, i think they forgot about fractal this time. ZERO communication about future raids, ZERO, did you hear me? ABSOLUTELY ZERO INFORMATION.
---
Exactly what I take away from this. If I wanted to be cynical I'd say her recent tweet storm with focus on the toxicity is a giant deflection from their own inadequacies. And sometimes I'm cynical.
---

Sorry, in the country where Klopp comes from we say it this way. I will correct it.
---
I once walked in on a very intimate roleplay in the big area with all the animals near fort trinity. At least I think that's the location? I randomly walk I in on some raunchy stuff in the most random of places.
---
Yup. The face of the company posting anywhere on social media is still the face of a company. That's the perception. Perception is everything. Again, I fear now her job is at risk.
---
install a dedicated pvp game where they actually have to give a shit about it to make money.
---
there are dozens.
---
&gt; Believe it or not, but they do actually read the contructive criticism.
---
If they can find it. How long do you think a dev is going use their free time reading through name calling, calls to have them fired, calling them incompetent, cheers about GW2 as a dead game etc before that dev decides it's not worth reading the comment threads here.
---
The worst part is we have the power to curate the community. We could be down voting the people who post non-constructively, hiding the posts which express a shared sentiment in the worst ways, while promoting the posts which are measured, constructive, polite and respectful while remaining logically consistent without cherry picking arguments to make their argument.
---
From having seen what a vocal part of the subreddit is capable of I am afraid that no kind of timing or wording would have been "good enough" to not create any drama. If it had been in 1 month/week it would have been a "delayed commentary", if it had been 1 month/week ago it would have been showed as a "look they knew and they just say that whatever we say they won't care" after being digged up by somebody.
---
There is a huge underlying issue that no amount of caution or "but she should have" will never solve. Some of those people will find ways to twist events to get angry, create drama and feel justiied in those kinds of action no matter what. No amount of callout will do the trick in this sub also tbh, I have tried it, some people have tried it and the only real final result is getting splashed by some of the harassement so I've kinda given up on this part :p
---
That's exactly what they do. The only times our feedback has been listened to has been after huge controversies, the rest of the time it's completely ignored.
---
What kind of lesson are we supposed to take out of that? They never, ever give a damn about civil discussion, they only care about fluff or drama.
---
[Here is the context of that trash tier that you coincidentally forgot to quote.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cxx0ki/the_announcement_was_actually_good_news/eyq1r9v/) Don't worry, it happens.
---
The stream was cool but they could have done it in the Guild Chat studio if they wanted a stream that badly. I feel sorry for the people who took time out of their days to be in that theater.
---
I dropped into the Spanish stream for a bit to see what the reaction over there was (more or less the same) and I'll echo something that was said which perfectly sums it up: *What* they announced was good. *How* they announced it was terrible.
---
the only one being toxic here is you, going by: "we need to" when more or less any dedicated moderator is doing a lot of work, in terms of reddit in their free time, already and check all the reports and if something should be deleted or banned.  
---
maybe, just maybe, think a bit before you write something and shit on all the work these people do with bullshit arguments. this is what makes people furious in the first place.  
---
...and btw. the community does that. even the automod works like that. i had a meme removed because people reported it and the automod listed it as something that has to do with a stream from teapot...but as it stands it was fine, so after asking one of our mods he got it back up.  
---
so...i do really not know what you are on about. but you are free to check websites like removed reddit or several other reddit archieves where you can see what exactly got removed. you will be suprised.
---
I started typing a comment that said "I don't think they're taking it personally as in 'omg Rubi said I was being abusive and harassing employees'....I mean, *I'm* not taking it personally..." but actually, upon further thought, I think some people *are* taking it personally, *because that is the only kind of responses the devs are making*, so either
---
(a) the devs are addressing the absolutely awful truly abusive people *and completely ignoring the thousands of other things people are saying*, and not engaging with the community at all, only engaging with the evil outliers, 
---
or
---
(b) the devs are lumping negative but fair comments (eg [this was a waste of our time and you should feel bad for your bad marketing skills](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cy6mjb/game_developers_in_2019_lets_only_publicly/eyqnoo1/)) in with truly toxic and heinous attitudes (eg "the devs are worthless [expletive] who should kill themselves and spare us the trouble").
---
I think the people who are taking it personally and getting defensive is assuming option B is what's happening, particularly if they haven't seen any examples of heinous behavior. I will say, I haven't been scouring the internet about it, I've been in this and two other reddit posts, so I personally have not seen a SINGLE instance of that behavior, although I know the internet well enough to be confident that it IS happening... but there are assuredly people who have not encountered that toxicity at all. In that case, it is completely reasonable to read the dev responses about "toxic, evil, mean responses", and go "wait, the only things I've seen have been factual, functional complaints about lack of communication and/or content, including MY rational, adult comment. Why are the devs saying THAT is toxic and abusive?!! They cannot take any criticism at all!"
---
I miss two weeks ago before this sub turned into a spiraling shithole of negativity.
---
since they didn't purchase the expansion, i'd say that's absolutely fair.
---
dark crystal VR RPG, where you play as a muppet gelfling. Everything looks exactly as it does in the movie and it has the attention to detail and world building of witcher 3.
---
No butis you have a problem with semetry the glass is broken in one eye. I cant deal with it. lol Why a broken glass. I hoped for a long time they would have a pristine version of the helmet too.
---
&gt;and Alliances were announced like 19 months ago ? ).
---
3 years ago... I wasn't keeping track but I pulled up an old AMA for something yesterday and it was mentioned in the comments.
---
They're pretty much just concern trolling at this point, cherrypicking the insults of some assholes to ignore all the legit discussion.
---
And an ugly ass armor set that looks like it came straight out of WoW. Lol here, have some retextured masterwork quality level 20 gear. Be happy you’re even getting it and stfu.
---
Have you gotten yours yet? Still waiting for mine.
---
Please. Are you telling me the general tone and content of the tweet isn't the way that Anet has been portraying themselves for years?
---
"Please community voice your critic as nice as possible" just to ignore us when we do?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cy6mjb/game_developers_in_2019_lets_only_publicly/eyqxsjy/ rather than typing it all twice.
---
&gt; So yeah, don't expect a real reaction to the reception until the weekend ends.
---
or ever... this is still Anet who don't like to communicate. Only tell them it's there, when the patch hits.
---
&gt; The majority of the feedback is valid (the tone may be dissapointed and sad but its still valid feedback). But this kind of feedback gets ignored over and over and over again.
---
Maybe let's wait until Monday/Tuesday (when patches and news usually hit) for their proper, official response? This announcement was on Friday and we still have weekend and as far as I know Anet doesn't work during weekends. They might have some meeting tommorow regarding this overblowing feeback and release a statement next day.
---
Smells like a Jessica Price situation brewing
---
I mean, even though I primarily use build templates for raids/fractals, I also use them in open world and WvW and there are plenty of casual players who also do that. For instance, if you were simply swapping between elite specs like Dragonhunter and Firebrand, that would still necessitate swapping your gear, traits, and utility skills. It would be a hassle to click everything + remember what to take. I think the number of people who benefit from build templates isn’t constrained to endgame PVE and is much bigger than you think.
---
Those things don't equal out though. You don't deserve death threats because of a game. A fucking video game. No matter what a dev does. Thousand of hours and dollars and all of a sudden your outraged. Sure.
---
No, there will still be plenty of attention. Removing irrelevant demographics from the population isn't going to have any impact precisely because they're irrelevant in the first place.
---
You may have sold yourself the fantasy that "anet needs us!!!!!1", but the reality is they don't, again leading to this entire situation in the first place.
---
It hasn't arrived for me as well, yet.
---
I get what you're saying ( for example people attacking Hello Games even after giving their roadmap, and more egregious after they actually delivered ).
---
Still, I can't stop thinking that a CM should know that the first statement even remotely tangent to the current situation should come from the company itself.
---
The show's done, there's no way to change that, that's right. But the current discussion is still about the communication being so distant between players and devs. This statement done now by the CM ( speaking for herself or not people will not generally care ) before any company one is just bad timing.
---
I can't keep thinking that this could've gone much better. Maybe you're right, I don't know but I want to underline what I think is an ingenuous move that hurts first and foremost a very valid message.
---
&gt;I don't know if you are ignoring us because you actually have nothing to show.
---
This is almost certainly the case. The best thing to do is just go play other games. Wait and see if they release content that you're interested in.
---
Teapot realized this and he is expressing a lot more PMA lately which is a highlight of how much happier players would be if they stop waiting for new content and just go enjoy yourself elsewhere.
---
The game won't die without you but constant complaining would do more damage to the game than your absence.
---
technically, one is a worm is a worm, and another is a caterpillar therefore capable of butterflying in time
---
sdgoökjhnswhbnvsönv 
---
lmao what the fuck do you think is being ignored in favor of posts about the toxic community, you potato. There *is* constructive feedback all over the fucking place, eternally long posts about balance, raids, wishes etc. 
---
How do you want THE COMMUNITY^^TM to focus on constructive feedback as one entity? Anet picks and choses what they want to focus on, and it's the fucking drama and some toxic letters from some mentally insane people. What is important to Rubi as a private person is this, in that order:
---
1. Happy go lucky people who never criticize her work and pat her on the back.
---
2. Batshit insane people who verbally abuse others.
---
3. Probably quaggans
---
Notice how 
---
- Taking the more demanding fanbase of the game seriously.
---
Is missing from that list?
---
I wouldn't mind a new x-pack for GW1, either.
---
Yeah every fractal release after SO had been like that.
---
Afraid she is going to lose her job? What the hell over what? Stating a perfectly reasonable opinion? She didn't call anyone rando asshats or go on a vicious twitter rampage, she basically said to not villify/abuse developers. 
---
Albeit it was a poorly time statement after the announcement, but she later went onto clarify it was mostly about the Apex drama. Jesus christ you guys are picking apart and putting way too much effort on the wrong things here.
---
How does that solve the problem?
---
We're all glad to read your opinion here in english. Now what? Anet gave French servers so people who only speak French came. Whether it's wrong not to know English doesn't change the problem. People speaking French but not English teamed with people speaking English but not French. Nobody will learn the other language for the time of the match-up. French people who can't speak English when it's obligatory to learn in school, whether they are proud of it or regret it, won't read your comment and start going back to English lessons. 
---
This isn't a thread discussing education of a country. This is a thread about two servers who can't understand each other being linked together. Even if from your moral point, French people are bastards who should be punished for slacking in school and playing PPT, there's another server who didn't ask for anything and who, according to your value, should be praised and not punished (people from all countries speaking in English and going for PPK).
---
Even if you were right, you'd be right for nothing. That's why your comment is useless. It's a just real life politics karma magnet.
---
Actions speak louder than words.
---
except they listened to the community about the introductory raid bosses, so just basically they want to bring more players to try out how the raid feels like, and hope that the community of more advanced in raids players will help those new players out. 
---
MightyTeapot even admitted that it's a very awesome announcement, that may help build a better raid community, and bring new people to try this amazing element of the game without much stress. 
---
( [https://twitter.com/mightyteapot/status/1167560497333440514](https://twitter.com/mightyteapot/status/1167560497333440514) ) - yes, maybe those missions doesn't answer all the questions, but hopefully that's just the start.
---
They never said 24 hours, they said later this week/early next week since they're all at PAX right now.
---
Yea none of that is toxic.
---
 
---
Also you not agreeing does not mean it is irrational.
---
You already played what you paid for though and you left before all of this even happened.
---
You can't lose players that dont exist.
---
Terrible exec team, terrible management, terrible marketing team. Thats what all of these things really come down too.
---
Thanks! :D
---
You're right, my bad. She manages Social Media ( still a spokeperson for most people, tho ).
---
&gt; Tyria is neoliberal? U wot mate? We have a dictatorship, a technocracy, a military junta, a theocracy and whatever crazy ancap shit the Norn are up to. None of those look very liberal let alone neoliberal to me.
---
And are any of those aspects ever actually explored in the game though?
---
There is no class conflict, no actual strugle inbetween anyone. All the factions seem to be getting alone fine both internally and externally with no real mass upheaval, and no one appears to distrust anyone. The only villains ever just so happen to be random traitors here and there, as if the current structures are just perfect and only the bad guys would want them gone.
---
All the factions get along just fine. There's some charr-human rebels but that's the full extent of it any nuanced conflict and its never explored beyond "rebels bad, state good".
---
In season 2 we saw that the asura used to capture and experiment on sylvari, that was intresting as fuck, whatever happened to that? Oh, I guess they kinda stopped and are good buddies now?
---
Like no asura remain that still view sylvari as golems? No sylvari remain that distrust asura? No old wounds or old scars? 
---
That intresting aspect is never seen and never explored in the main story and is forgotten immediately after its introduced.
---
HoT (Even its trailer) was supposed to be all about how now everyone distrusts the sylvari, mordrem or not, resulting in innocent sylvari getting the short end of the stick by their friends. But that aspect is also never actually explored in HoT or its aftermaths.
---
Everytime the story comes close to getting intresting or having some grey area or nuance, it seems that just immediately forget about it, or try to get it over with as soon as possible so we can move to more dragons.
---
&gt;Hell, one of the very first events in the entire Guild Wars story is a literal genocide: the Searing.
---
Yes and that was actually one of the best parts of the guild wars. It was actual proper conflict, between factions both of which believed they were in the right. Why can't get we get more that?
---
From what I gathered she's the community marketing manager.
---
Not to be an asshole, and not to attack her any personal level, but you have to be doing pretty bad at marketing to end up selling yoga pants for a video game studio.
---
HoT (Even its trailer) was supposed to be all about how now everyone distrusts the sylvari, mordrem or not, resulting in innocent sylvari getting the short end of the stick by their friends. But that aspect is also never actually explored in HoT or its aftermaths and never brought up again once.
---
Everytime the story comes close to getting intresting or having some grey area or nuance, it seems that just immediately forget about it, or try to get it over with as soon as possible so we can move to fighting more dragons while holding hands.
---
Does she work at Anet?
---
You do live in 2019 with the rest of us?
---
Mmmm I love me some casual sexism.
---
"  And if the announcement has made you angry, maybe it's time you found something else to do."   
---
Ok then let's more than 80 % of the active playerbase leave the game, it's ok it's not Anet fault. It's because of the bad player who always want more, who can't post a constructiv criticism, who can't stop harass the dev ...   
---
CMON !! We're playing this game, we're the reason this game is still here, doing nothing and leave it's even worth than posting negative but constructiv feedback !!   
---
Doing nothing and leave is letting the game dying slowly and silently.
---
https://i.imgur.com/ge2pjNW.jpg adjusted to represent their official stance as a company.
---
I was thinking the very same thing!
---
All the factions get along just fine. There's some charr-human rebels but that's the full extent of any nuanced conflict and its never explored beyond "rebels bad, state good".
---
That intresting aspect is never seen and never explored in the main story and is forgotten immediately after its introduced, despite the fact that it basically happened about 30 years ago, and most of the people who suffered under it are still alive.
---
So what do you think will make that better? Verbal abuse will lead to the opposite. It will lead to a broken community and game devs who don’t want for work for them anymore.
---
My cynical side also wonders if it’s kept it its current state on purpose because people spend so much $$$ on server transfers.
---
I can’t speak to EU, but I know on NA that every time they relink servers, lots of people all transfer to whoever Blackgate’s new link is so they can be with the mega server.
---
Having alliances and small scale maps to play on would completely obliterate however much income this brings in for them.
---
But they will never be able to. There is no choice
---
This is a much better meme lol. People are focusing too much on random twitter BS when our attention should be on the lack of any *official* communication.
---
To whom do you address this message in English on an English speaking website?
---
"just learn english 4head"
---
Waw thank you, problem solved.
---
They are a great introduction, but if this means that there will not be a new raid for even longer to give people time to get “into 10 man content” then don’t even born making new wings because the community will be gone.
---
I think he's referring to this quote on the linked blogpost:
---
" If you already own *Guild Wars 2: Path of Fire* but didn’t purchase *Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns*, both expansions **will be available on your account within twenty-four hours of the announcement.** "
---
What happens when wing 8 comes out?
---
They kind of are/were. Problem is which segment of the raider base do you balance around? Joe Average, or Snow Crows? There's a significant gap between those two groups, and balancing for one is going to be hell for the other. Additionally, GW2 doesn't have the luxury of self nerfing raids through loot drops etc. A boss is always going to more or less maintain the same difficulty level. Sure, people will improve, get better, and learn the nuances of a boss so that those players have an easier time, but not to the point where an e.g. 300 pull boss becomes a 1 pull boss.
---
And yes, that could be solved by difficulty tiers, but they're not doing that (for whatever reason).
---
Plus balancing around the current meta is pretty scary, cause that permanently locks in /that meta/ for that wing and would allow for very little variation (VG for instance will always require cDPS). Or what if balance changes significantly alter a class mechanic? If, for instance, they had built a boss that absolutely required two Chronos to share Distortion to the entire raid to deal with some mechanic things have would have gone to absolute shit.
---
Keeping things vague and broad in terms of requirements makes the raiding quality of life much better than hard defining requirements imo (e.g. you must Distort this attack vs you must block this attack)
---
Well, her actual role is "Content Marketing Manager".
---
Yeah this hurricane is so unpredictable. Really really hoping we don't get hit too badly, especially now that it's cat 5
---
I'm not really sure what can of reaction is expected here tbh. All those points have honestly been re-hashed tens of time in the past months and even days.
---
What kind of discussion/reply would be expected here? Either people in a similar situation repeating the same exact point a 100th time, people saying they are wrong or people saying "bye" because they don't really see the point of such threads.
---
The deluxe is mainly if you want to support devs a bit more. You can even purchase it later in the gemstore for gems (so you can possibly do gold-&gt;gems if you are rich already), Gives some cosmetics, and PoF one gives access to premium crafting hub, basically all stuff needed very closely to each other compared to regular cities. There is way more zones in store like that. Character slot is nice but you get 5 out of the box and you can again buy more later with either money or gold.
---
Ultimate version is basically(for the cost of standard+gems) standard + 50€ worth of gems, plus all the deluxe stuff on top of that for free, basically, I would get that if you really want to go deep into it. But as gemstore sales did happened just like 1-2 weeks ago, probably easier to just get gems later when there will be sale again, for some added efficiency.
---
So it really depends on you, for regular play the standard one is pretty much enough. If you plan to spend more anyways, then I would look at the higher ones. With gems, you will eventually want to expand your bank, character slots, and potentially get some convenience items, however those can potentially wait until you either make some gold for them, or such, as for getting started you have enough of those.
---
&gt;No they dont but talking and communicating is how business in good faith is done
---
No, talking and transparency gets them punished by the pitchfork wielding reddit brainlets. In a climate where every announcement has backlash, **the only winning move is to not make the announcement**. 
---
You want change? Drop the pitchfork, babyrage and us-versus-them mentality. Express what you want updated, but don't rage if it takes a backseat to more pressing issues.
---
I didn't say it was right, I didn't say I agree. A quick google search will bring you back hundreds if not thousands of responses. For people who have lost their jobs posting on social media.
---
I'll second this.   
---
[u/fmmmlee](https://www.reddit.com/user/fmmmlee/) if you added launcher ability and the option to swap accounts this would be an amazing package instead of just a really awesome one.  Either way, thanks for this.
---
&gt; STOP USING TWITTER TO CONVEY COMPLEX MESSAGES.
---
How dare an individual use social media to make this statement. She should have used her diary or put a flier up on a wall on the street.
---
And a toxic minority's abusive comments ARE representative of the upset community as a whole?
---
That would be cool, most of the backpacks are gliders that are dyable anyway, so it makes sense to just turn on that bit of code.
---
As usual, focusing on the 1% that's toxic and ignoring the rest of the valid feedback and criticism.
---
No way, they handle criticism gracefully in comparison.
---
Bingo. It's bad PR to come out and admit it, but it's the reality of running a live game. They're not going to deprioritise the people that make up the majority of the playerbase. And if servicing the majority requires a large investment of developer resources to the exclusion of everything else, then that is really the only choice they have.
---
The mistake was having so many tangential modes in the first place.
---
&gt;So what do you think will make that better? 
---
Oh idk, bother to listen to the damn feedback that they keep asking for?
---
It's probably just a bug but I'd really like them to allow it.
---
So many cool back skins just don't match the colours of my chosen skins.
---
The only possible issue is that they've sold skins that are just a colour variant, the angel wings for example. They could give refunds for people that bought "duplicates" I guess.
---
i'm really looking forward to it, but we are at the near end of 2019 and i do not think that any of this will make it before 2020
---
The implication was that Mursaat's servants are the humans in Spirit Vale (and the other raid instances) ya goober
---
false. they released the information about competitive BEFORE the event. and didnt even mention it.
---
I think its more of a reference to that one and only dual ATM post on Antarctica
---
I have friends who told me the same thing yesterday. Done with GW2 and Done with Anet. Sad really.
---
How's a platform as limited as twitter capable of handling complex discussions? You can't compress complex issues in few words. That's arrogant toward the issues themselves.
---
It's a good time to be a troll when they reward toxic comments with more attention than criticism from their players.
---
Let's be honest, this sub has always been a festering pit of garbage covered with a thin veneer of "I painted my character" and "After 5 years I finally did it" posts.
---
&gt; Before release nothing is set in stone yet. Everything is malleable. If they encounter an insurmountable problem, or come up with a better design, or just run out of ideas - they can change the design any way they see fit, they can scrap it and start over entirely if something doesn't make sense. But when it's already released, changing anything will require more resources and cross-team collaboration. Rebalancing, retesting, recreating art assets if those are concerned, relocalization. Comparing that to when it's still in development: balancing is not needed until the last phases of design; testing is not needed until everything is coded and scripted; there is no art until everything is finalized, as it's probably the most expensive part of the development, and during design and development everything is done with "developer art" - boxes, spheres, repurposed existing effects; localization is only performed at the very last stages before release.
---
&gt;Designing the remaining two thirds of the traits. Best they can do is to have some thoughts and ideas, but putting effort into actually flashing out those ideas means they're going beyond the scope of what they should be doing. They're designing the entire spec, and not a third of it, as was planned. Now imagine how many things can go wrong over the course of 1-2 years of LS season development. The designer of the first third of the spec might leave the company, taking all their ideas with them, and whoever comes to replace them must resume work essentially from scratch, without the knowledge of the big picture the initial designed envisioned. Or the meta might shift radically, making the existing ideas for the spec no longer relevant, forcing them to either continue working on an obsolete-at-release spec or scrap it and restart. Or, the other side of the coin, they might want to design the rest of the spec specifically to pull the meta in another direction. Such design would rarely end up being cohesive.
---
Well yes, make a general outline/roadmap for what you want, plan it out and release it slowly. That's not difficult, it just requires organization.
---
I mean, hell warframe does it all the time. 
---
When they got too big an update, they release bits and pieces over time. They did it with lunaro, specters of the rail and war within, splitting them in 3, they're doing it now with grendel and gauss, splitting in 2, and they're gonna also do it with empyrean, releasing bits and pieces and completing them as time goes on, first the drydocks, and then other aspects as they are finalized so they can focus better.
---
It's not impossible/hard, it just requires some planning and a roadmap. I don't see why gw2 can't do a similar approach.
---
&gt;They have to deal with potential player backlash. They have to constantly go back and reevaluate recent changes in every balance patch, because major reworks never end up being perfect from the get-go.
---
Don't they already have to do that though? That's what I don't get, how is this backlash any different from that backlash?
---
Toxic. Reported.
---
&gt; Oh well, what can you do.
---
Actively advocate for the industry and community to change and use more respectful and constructive ways to interact with other humans instead of blaming the victims of abuse for speaking out about abuse at the wrong time or in the wrong way. We could try doing that.

I play a lot of WvW but always in a zerg with my guild, and I wanna try roaming. What class and build would you recommend ? I'm really bad at PvP and what I'd like to do is scout and cap camps.
---
Go tell them. Here we all speak English.
---
&gt;  Again, I fear now her job is at risk.
---
It's not.
---
The wiki still says Social Media manager. I honestly dunno if the CMM role doesn't include handling social medias, since they're a marketing conveyor.
---
You already have 5 man raids. Aka most bosses of w1-6.
---
It's equivalent of checking their personal facebook page, who they add, what photos they're in, what posts they make, etc...
---
Again, using their real name on Twitter is stupid. But the comparison I've presented still stands.  When she posts on Twitter, she's not doing it as a work-related subject. It may be topical. But it's not an outlet for PR.
---
Now, again and again, I'd say if someone were smart, they wouldn't use their real name and photo on social media. But it still stands.
---
You know, try to be someone who does something for hundred of thousands or even millions of people and then do something because you have to and probably know it isn't enough especially so after having to let people go you worked a long time with and after all of that you have to go through the shitshow that is this subreddit right now.
---
Don't you all think that will not affect them? Everything ArenaNet does will get criticized, every little bit. Even when they do something great there are some that screaming that this is still not enough. Try to walk in their shoes for a change and try to understand how so much negativity affects them.
---
And no, this is not to defend them or anything but damn, those posts I have seen over the last few days beating the same horse over and over again just to continue the circlejerk is really bad news. I know that ArenaNet has done little to address the points the community wanted to know but you need to tone it down one or two notches just to get your head clear again.
---
I'm really not surprised with them staying silent with how much stuff they are bombarded every single time they release something. It is never enough.
---
Nothing. It's simply that we can't delete posts and the mods delete comments that we want to have deleted by reporting it.
---
To be fair, when POF came out, I played for like 2 months and spent a lot in the shop because I was actively playing. I don't spend shit on the shop when I play a loving story episode for 6 hours every 3 months
---
What she's saying is 100% fine.  The other incident was cuz of personal attacks on player(s).
---
Huh, I thought the forum update came after the announcement. Ok, then I think that probably further implies that everyone is taking the holiday weekend and they'll have meetings on Tuesday to address the backlash and determine a responss. So again, our "when" is wednesday at the earliest or maybe late tusday.
---
Honestly at this point, it's pretty fucking disgusting. Developers use unjustified and ***extremely rare*** personal attacks, and they use them to justify brushing off ***every criticism*** by claiming that all criticism has been just like that. I'm sick and tired of it; this is 2019 and everybody on the internet
---
1. knows how internet backlash works at this point 
---
2. also knows that it's only a rare 1% of cases that are extreme enough to be called abusive
---
We don't live in an age where you can generalise the entire internet and also have everybody believe you. Most people that play games these days have been on the internet long enough to understand shitty extremists exist but *also understand* that valid criticism is very frequent. The idea management seems to have, that they can say "Oh no, people are being abuwsive, pwease feel sorry for us! We're humans too!" and have a community... what, believe that *everybody's* abused them? *Stop* criticising them? It's fucking childish, and downright disrespectful to both our intelligence, and to the genuine good discussions.
---
A lot of people keep claiming it's management too, but it isn't. It isn't just management. Rubi's recent language for example proves that it isn't management. Rubi closed down her own thread, and did so trying to pretend that *anybody who disagreed with her was basically saying "abuse is good"*. Who the fuck said that to her? Oh. Oh right, *fucking nobody*.
---
Maybe if developers and companies didn't want to be seen and treated like children, where we have to explicitly tell them really fucking *slowly* the basic expectations we have for them as companies or developers in the hopes that if we say it slowly and loud enough they might understand, they wouldn't *act* like children to begin with. Maybe if they wanted us to seriously respect them as fellow adults capable of holding a conversation, they'd *have a goddamn conversation* in the first place. But no, no. It's all fine as long as people love them, but as soon as you criticise them in a rational way, you're being "abusive" towards them, you're treating them like they're sub-human and *they* throw the temper-tantrum.
---
They said it might take a while.
---
Don't forget that they're at PAX right now.
---
Rubi has been talking about these kinds of things before the event as well. She does have a pinned tweet from 2016 that talks about this kind of behavior for example. And she did specifically talk about this kind of behavior about a week or so before the event as well.
---
Took me three watches to realise it
---
I thought we were talking about twitter replies.
---
That'd be no fun, I hope they go all out with the customisation.
---
Don't forget the Living Story chapters... They were free on release but you need to buy them with gems to catch up (and technically still can be got for free as you can convert gold to gems). 
---
That said, there's a hell of a lot of good game experience ahead of you! Be warned: expansion content is harder. If you can make it solo in the Silverwastes, you should be okay, but if you're just hopping about Orr it'll seem like a bit of a punch in the gut.
---
Yea the problem is that they’re not making it. I wouldn’t mind waiting for that content as long as 1: they’re making it and 2: they actually tell us what’s going on. Right now raids and fractals aren’t being released nowhere near the rage the new living world episodes are, and that’s like the easiest most replayable content in the game. The problem isn’t that there’s no challenging content at all, the problem is that it gets sidelined for content that’s not that replayable.
---
I think those people are mostly those who already adhere to such thoughts.
---
I won't argue about most of your points but they could sort the build diversity a bit if they made all weapons equally viable. 
---
Example: you won't see a warrior using a rifle because the weapon is terrible, or a guardian with a staff outside tagging mobs or a mace... the list goes on. 
---
They can sort of fix that if they reworked the weapon skills. 
---
New specializations kept the game fresh and added more diversity to the table, hence why some people are disappointed now. Elite specs IMO were one of the main reasons I bought the expansions.
---
im stating what ive observed, your just spewing vitriolic biased hate toward me for making observations. literally the kind of language and behavior YOU are using is the kind that makes them go radio silent when they try to talk to people. rubi was right, people like you have a problem with how you use your anonymity to be so rude and cruel. i dont know what kinds of things they could do to make this not the case, but any time they try to talk to the non-toxic players, its people with language like yours that muddle the discussions because opening the lane of discussion without an inherent bias to who is allowed to participate is why they can get so flooded with garbage language and garbage assumptions like yours. evaluate your self please
---
The specs not even being mentioned was the worse part. If there is any content that fits the "expansion-level content" quote that we were given, it was specs \[everything else technically has been added in the LW seasons\].
---
This was all they needed to mention and do and they failed at it. But at least we got Funkos and leggings.
---
Also throw in a smiley face at the end just to fucking piss you off
---
Since yesterday yes.
---
But thanks.
---
I mean, why do people comment on the internet at all? I think OP views themself as a member of this community and they wanted to share their feelings and say "Goodbye". Nothing wrong with that.
---
Fair enough, the timing is poor though.
---
As others have said there's thousands of hours of good content for a player just starting now. There was a recent announcement about future content that disappointed the veterans. 
---
Also, Guild Wars 1 is still online and running and playable, so Guild Wars 2 isn't going anywhere anytime soon. It's relatively cheap to run the servers, most of the expense comes from paying developers to make new content. There were recent layoffs (at many companies - ANet, Blizzard, etc) - but that won't affect previous content, just future.
---
What? Devs speaking out against toxicity is directed at said toxicity? How dare you say that! /s
---
The comments on this sub are proof enough that theres been a harsh shift in tone, and not a "were disappointed but civil" one.
---
Same here, I just uninstalled the game, i didn't lost so much since most ppl I know already stopped anyway.
---
The game is such in a bad state if you don't play only for the story.
---
Honestly, you don't need to learn very much in terms of language in WvW to be fruitful. If you're there for comradely or social engagement, then yes you'd need more than a basic grasp of the language being used. 
---
That being said, a commander really only needs to learn a few basic commands to lead an entire squad. Cloudfly in NA is a perfect example. Dude knows like 15 English words and can still very highhandedly command a 50 man zerg to great efficiency. 
---
The experience is what you make of it, sometimes there is a language barrier. Sometimes you put in a little effort, sometimes you don't.
---
Guild War 1 is also just an amazing game for both PvE and PvP
---
they need to have an entire thing where they sit down and talk about whats coming for wvw and pvp. not just a small blog post. give some sort of time table or tell us why its taking so long
---
Who is Apex, AoC and Sigma? What is she talking about there? I apologize for literally living under a rock.
---
No people will bitch it's the wrong information (S5) or it takes too long (WvW Restructure) or it's not real content (Swiss tournaments).
---
I don't get what your point here is. A lot more people didn't. Having a hard time believing this? Then clearly one doesn't play much or sits around with ppt clowns that actively avoid the pvp part of the pvp game mode.
---
If HoT was somewhere on sale for less then 10euro, it was because they wanted to get rid of codes or someone hacked them or simply gave for free.  
---
Similar thing didn't happen with Core GW2. Core is essence of GW2 F2P. HoT is not made F2P. If it was made F2P we woudn't have this conversation. 
---
Some people would play original price if game is good. You cannot say i got what i want when i'm disrespected as customer. I'm someone who wants to spend more money on game but not that way. Also no one asked for glider. If something is free doesn't mean it is good move. I didn't talk about refunding as well nor do i want to do that. You need to take a good look on that description on picture where mount tab is (one in bauble not cloud). If you don't see anything wrong with it you are commenting to wrong person and your are not getting the point.
---
Good marketing is when you know what you are doing and not disrespecting veteran players with that. Good marketing is when you fix that stupid description which you can see in picture. Good marketing is when you treat all your customers equally and so on.
---
If wing 8 comes out
---
/r/TrahearneJokes
---
I honestly believe that ANet is as in the dark as we are. Ever since the launch of GW2 they’ve just kind of chucked stuff at the wall to see what sticks, with no real long term plan. I’m yet to see a release by them that feels coherent and focused instead of just “lets see if this works!”
---
My perspective is that there is no plan past season 5, which they’re not referring to as a season likely to raise our hopes that it will be more than just another season. They’re going to do what they’ve always done, which is to try some stuff and see what does, and doesn’t, work. And then ignore it all and move onto something else anyway.
---
It’s so hard to get excited about anything Guild Wars-related anymore. All of the content we’ve seen introduced to the game since launch like Fractals, Meta Events, Dungeons, and now Raids just seem to be introduced and then dropped and I expect the same thing to happen with these baby raids. That’s without even mentioning the state that SPVP and WVW is in.
---
I expect to login and check out the new season every few months, beat the hour long story, and then go and play something else like ESO in the meantime. 
---
It’s depressing as fudge. I absolutely love GW2’s mechanics, world, and many of its content but this is starting to feel like an abusive relationship now. You keep expecting them to change and they say they will but then nothing really happens.
---
And make GW1 free already!!!
---
The Marketing team has never done well ever on anything. Over hype is just as critical as under hype. Going to far is still falling to short of success. This event was not a success. Announcing 30 days ahead, blog posts and lets plays and a count down with an image that alters over time is not for what amounts to a small dlc. 
---
If its not a small DLC then they did an even worse job making sure that the correct information was conveyed. If the Saga is in some way different that what the LS was then they did a terrible job explaining how a Saga is something to get excited for. 
---
They took what should have been a trailer along with a blog post, maybe one lets play or something for the devs to tease it. Thats all. 
---
This fanfare was that which companies use to launch games, new titles or even expansions. 
---
The marketing team did no better then the management who decided to go this route and who decided to approve what to talk about. Its like stooges made these decisions. 
---
Now I am thinking back to Ruby twitter and wondering. Did upper management allow the devs to decide and put this on without the marketing team? Was this all the Devs?
---
Anet was transparent the first two years.
---

This is the home instance system we already have.  What would we get out of a separate system that we can't get from upgrading home instances?
---
&gt; fishing
---
No thanks.  This isn't some revolutionary feature, it's just another minigame.  There's one of two routes to go with it - you either make it a non-interactive way to farm via skinner box or you integrate it into everything and piss people like me off who don't want another hoop to jump through.
---
Wait how do we know they aren't making it? Wing 7 came out not too long ago and it's been well established that raids have large gaps between them. Likewise I haven't seen any commentary from devs about scrapping fractal development. So how do we know?
---
Frankly I think this is the point where certain portions if the community look in a mirror and say they know the desires of the playerbase. Open world and living world is easily the most accessible and appealing content to the largest audience. GW2 sold itself as an RPG with detailed story progression in an open world. They have stuck to that for 7 years. If you think that raids and fractals are the most desirable comtent then I don't think you've taken a good look at what the masses are doing.
---
&gt; There's an abundance of comments calling Anet incompetent, greedy, or saying that they have no plans and are just stringing people along.
---
Imagine being crazy enough to think saying these truths is toxic now.
---
EA would like a word with you since you're good at defending these practices.
---
It's really funny how hard people are pushing the "saying bye to people leaving the game is toxic".
---
People are allowed to enjoy games you don't and disagreeing with you while you are trashing it isn't toxic.
---
Some of you are just using toxic as a buzzword to feel like your opinions are more valid than others.
---
Got mine but I preordered both HOT and POF when they came out.
---
&gt;But given none of us have intimate knowledge of ANet's goals or plans no one can actually say that they have none
---
We have years of knowledge that they have no idea where they want the game to go.
---
Don’t have time for raiding anymore, honestly. But I’ve helped with training raids plenty when I did have the time. But the point is, some people need help adjusting and it’s hard to adapt to raids when you have no real in between that’s easily accessible. Fractals take a while to grind out and training raids/runs aren’t exactly common or commonly done well. 1 person leading 7-9 new people won’t get past a single boss in hours. It also takes multiple times of killing the boss to really get them used to mechanics. I’d usually run a gadgeteer power engi on guardian because I could single handedly hold back the red orbs of death from the group between flamethrower, throw mines, and big ol bomb. I could also handle greens in a pinch with jump shot incase something went wrong, and could use Moa elixir if CC was too slow. Letting the new players focus on learning the blue circles first. Once they’ve got that they can start worrying about other mechanics like greens or reds. Once they know the fight they can worry about stuff like tanking or healing. But that is a lot of time investment, and many just don’t have that time.
---
Strike Missions should help get those people used to the mechanics needed (look out for circles, when to dodge vs when to walk out, getting better at managing your position, learning tells, etc.) to help make the introduction to raids easier, as with the public mode or whatever, more accessible to those who don’t have hours to get a group together and smash their heads against a wall. 
---
Sure they could do dungeons or fractals, but fractals they won’t stick around for up to t3 or t4 when mechanics matter, and dungeons mechanics don’t really matter. Open world is all Zerg so mechanics don’t matter. We still have to wait and see how they turn out, how rewards will be, and how many Strike Missions they’ll add (like will we see bosses from previous seasons turned into strike missions? Or only going forward?) but I am hopeful.
---
Your logic is flawed.
---
This is a result of anets incompetence. Nobody is responsible for their lack of communication but them. The results of their lack of communication might not be pleasant, but it takes two, baby.
---
they could be hints at Kodan becoming a part of Central Tyrian society. We've helped them fight off icebrood (Honor of the Waves) They've taught us about their magic (Koda's Flame); and we'll be delving into their lore some more in Season 5.
---
The layer is not thin
---
Backpacks are technically weapons from an game engine point of view, and dying weapons has been sacrificed so we could have the trading post. Maybe they finally worked around the limitation?
---
inb4 the internet launches a mob crusade to get her fired like they did last time an Anet employee thought they could speak their mind on social media.
---
&gt; It actually is, pubic perception is key.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
If you don't care then you shouldn't reply xD
---
Nonsense to those that don't understand, meme to those who do.
---
I mean, depending on the business.........
---
Why thank you. I try hard. 
---
But if it's a truth that ANet is incompetent and has no plans, why are you even still playing their game? If that is true then GW2 literally has no future to speak of.
---
This is NOT about Anet not answering criticism dating back to 2015, this is ONLY about toxic and abusive behaviour.
---
That's fine to address directly, but when that becomes your only statement, the implication is as u/ixiduffixi said.
---
Are you saying “they” in reference to 2 distinct sets of people in the same sentence?  I’m not trying to be the grammar police, but I’m trying to figure out what you are asking.
---
Not chronological, my husband got his before I did and he only got all the expacs last year. They are just rolling it out in waves.
---
&gt; you're just spewing vitriolic biased hate toward me for making observations
---
No, I'm mocking your clueless duality in complaining that you don't get the information you ask for, while berating the devs for giving out information.
---
&gt; people like you have a problem with how you use your anonymity to be so rude and cruel. 
---
Typical brainlet can spew it out in the form of demands for the devs, but can't take it when it's directed at them.
---
&gt;  its people with language like yours that muddle the discussions 
---
Hey brainlet, you can't spew vitriol and complaints then take the moral high ground when someone calls you out on your bullshit
---
There have also been several versions of a roadmap (a rose by any other name or some shit) but the angry mob is angry.
---
Honestly I'm used to Anet being on both ends of the bad armor spectrum so this was honestly the least disappointing thing.
---
That's par for the course these days. Devs on older games used to happily say what they were working on, but too many people raged when some of it got cut. Nowadays the industry standard is don't talk about a thing until you're ready. Even Aonuma of Zelda said he regretted how early they teased Breath of the Wild.
---
&gt; Most of GW2 is not in a good place 
---
Also I'm not being toxic, you guys.  All the things you people like actually aren't good because I said so but that's not me being toxic that's just me being REEEALLLLLL yo.
---
Whatever dude.  Game's doing fine.  Devs are doing fine.  I'm having fun every day.
---
what's the exact name of the tonic please ?
---
When i said on the forum they prioritised third party information selling for non-game goodies (the watch) over transparency or involvement with the raid event (or organizing really any kind of event at all) my topic was removed with the warning that i shouldn't insult the devs so. 
---
When criticism, combined with by feedback and suggestions, is called an insult by the devs, i lost all hope we could have a healthy communication
---
Simply adding a mode to previous raids won't do anything.
---
[Here is a really good guide for playing the story in order, along with supplemental material.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8wq6aj/play_gw2_in_story_order_guide/)

&gt; gets called out on their bullshit, shuts down instead of explaining their thought process. Goes radio silent.
---
...
---
&gt; Arenanet get's flooded by entitled babies screaming at them with no substance or reasoning. Shuts down. 
---
&gt; The duality and irony of the pitchfork redditor maintaining radio silence toward me while calling out the radio silence of the arenanet is completely lost upon their feeble, babyrage mind.
---
Not a very smart person are you?
---
The devs over at anet should really be old enough to know and follow this simple rule:
---
&lt;°)))))&gt;&lt;
---
You're implying that they are blind and deaf to the complaints and have not discussed them. I don't know how or why you would assume that.
---
Why would wing 8 not come out?
---
I see, thanks for letting me know!
---
My revenant is wearing Blossoming Mist Shard and it's the best armour set I've seen in ages.
---
My thief though... it's clippy buttcapes almost all the way down, except for a few PoF armours and the birthday Luminous. Urk
---
Yes, Im implying that and they proved that recently.
---
Up to 72 hours they said, expect it tomorrow at the latest.
---
Asking the real questions!
---
It’s be nice to see proof of people leaving actually by doing something like that.  I kind of respect them more that way.  Otherwise it kind of feels like all the people who claimed they were moving to Canada if Trump got elected.
---
Ah i see ty, i ill make a ticket then
---
Isn't hard mode of Strike Missions pretty much Raids?
---
Then you might actually be in the right!
---
Damn it Tybalt.
---
I still think ascended gear was a mistake for this game. 
---
I wouldn't have minded it as much if it was just some account bound gear that provided infusions.  
---
They completely betrayed their game's philosophy.
---
People do rage at beginners though. And some beginners don’t have those hours to spend on making no visible progress for them. The issue is more the “Ive killed it once or twice so I don’t want a training raid but I get raged at in a normal raid” group who need more time getting their shit together because they’re honestly not skilled enough for raids because outside of raids they don’t use their skills for shit. 
---
Anyways point is ideally strike missions fix this problem with people just being told to “get gud” as they’ll have an actual skill transition. So hopefully, this won’t really be an issue.
---
"You haven't broken any official rules but we'll still ban you. What are you going to do about that? :)"
---
What I realized last night is that all I want from ArenaNet is a letter from Mike Z or Mike O within the next 1-2 weeks or with the LS5E01 Saga "Prologue."  I don't expect it to satisfy every concern, but I expected their presentation to at least say, "We're working on ___."  Many players are scared and feel abandoned by Friday's LS5E01 announcement.  I can't blame them for feeling that way.
---
You clearly have not been paying attention to what's been happening on this sub the last few weeks or in the social media feeds of game developers. Have a look through the responses to the different ArenaNet staff members (current and former) every time they get linked to this sub during a controversy. There is a clear problem and acting like there isn't is creating an environment where the abuse thrives.
---
How about additional difficulties so hardcores stop being bored and casuals start playing them?
---
Isn’t that the problem though? That they have a tiny team working on it? Meanwhile no meaningful updates besides the Warclaw and Elite Specs from PoF (which isn’t even directly a WvW update) in years to WvW because “oh we’re working on alliances”
---
"Mounts, a feature that has existed for just under 2 years, has contributed to us receiving only 2 expansions in 7 years."

What? This is a fucking joke.

I'm thinking Tuesday or Thursday given Labor Day Weekend.
---
yeah, I mean we all feel this way, but it's obvious that ArenaNet is too limited in what they can do. The announcement told me that they are struggling to even make what they already are.
---
This is not about getting upset about mean words, its about treating your customers with respect. Its about engaging with your community. It’s about NOT cherrypicking the mean comments to get upset about. 
---
The forum example only MAGNIFIES the real issue. Which is, in fact, that anet is completely out of touch. 
---
It’s the INTERNET. It’s like we forgot about xbox live. People with shitty morals will ALWAYS exist. People will ALWAYS be vile. But you don’t give those people power. You give respect to the people who are actually trying to engage. Now, you tell me what anet did. And tell me who is out of touch.
---
Noticed the same. While he doesn't look bad, per say, the difference between him and Rytlock is a bit like between a charicature of a Charr and realistic portrayal. Think it's mostly in the elongated snout and less defined, cleaner texture job. Probably also more varied and readable expressions giving the feel of anthropomorphization. Traditionally, Charr have been mostly stuck in a permanent look of being neutral/annoyed, with a few rare smug grins thrown in.
---
Too bad her atrocious, unprofessional attitude when it comes to moderating official forums has been adopted by remaining mods. She's like a phantom shit - you can get rid of the turd in plain sight, but the stench will still remain.
---
&gt;But given none of us have intimate knowledge of ANet's goals or plans no one can actually say that they have none. 
---
That is once again, on anet. They refuse to communicate, they refuse to tell us what's going on, they refuse to give us a roadmap. 
---
People were holding out hope that they reason they refused to commnicate was because they had something massive that would blow everyone's mind in the works, and when the time came to announce that something all they gave us was hot topic tshirts and funkopops.
---
The time for them to prove that they goals and plans was the announcement and they blew it.
---
&gt;We know that as of right now they are working on the prologue, episode 1, and episode 2 of Icebrood.
---
We already KNEW they were working on season 5 months ago, when they said that season 5 would immediately follow season 5. This is not news. We already KNEW this.
---
&gt;We know that something is making Alliances a more complicated process tban expected. 
---
"We're announcing that in a month from now we'll be announcing, that in a few months from now, we'll be making an announcement regarding WvW."
---
&gt; The PvP team announces their plans going forward.
---
Swiss system tournaments were promised an entire year ago. This is not "new".
---
&gt; So yeah, it seems to me like Anet is trying to move forward and do something, and I get the feeling they felt uncomfortable speaking about half baked ideas and content. That's par for the course in gaming today since gamers get so fucking angry when devs cut features that they'd originally announced but then decoded weren't working.
---
That is 100% on anet and their incompetence and they have literally no one else to blame for it, saying "omg de gamers" is a cheap copout.
---
Warframe community is happy with everything announced for empyrean, Destiny community is happy with everything announced for shadowkeep, monster hunter community is happy with everything announced for iceborne, same for final fantasy and shadowbringers, same for path of exile and blight, same for WoW and classic.
---
When nintendo announced they were going to delay metroid to make it better everyone approved.
---
Blaming everything on "le angry gamers" is a shitty excuse for incompmetent devs to cover up their own lazyness.
---
I know what you mean. I love Tyria to much to abandon it now. That said, my hopes for the future are grim. It's not midnight, but the candles are fickle. 
---
Even if the game is on life support, I'd keep playing.. for a while.
---
With all the talk about how we should treat the devs like humans, some who say so sure treat them like gods.
---
It's pretty close to the one face that already is there. The one that looks like the Grand Lion Griffin skin.
---
ill counter that with one of the only companies that has disappointed me more than ANet; 343i. they've been more transparent about every step of bringing Reach and MCC to PC than anything else theyve worked on. monthly updates on where the insider program is up to and what exactly theyre working on atm, exactly what the major hold ups are, what their possible time tables are, and when they want to push stuff out. if ANet was close to the amount of transparency that is presented by the "almost killer of Halo", then i really dont think there would be any where near as much anger.
---
I either don't get your comment, or you don't get mine.
---
you must mean "transparency".
---
"I do not think it means what you think it means."
---
To be fair , if Anet would stop policing their forums when people give FAIR opinions on the game they wouldnt be attacked by the 1% . Communicate, dont pick n choose questions to answer, You want us to play the game, You want our Money. YOU DONT DELIVER, We try to tell ANET time and time again. They do not care. They are not capable of pulling their heads out of each others bums and its shameful that even after lay offs they dont see they are the issue. 
---
Personally i think its time some1 cleaned that entire office out and replaced them with people who care for the game and players, because at the end of the day, the player base is shrinking and we all know what happens when an MMO fails. Its shut down .
---
&gt; The damage they've done by not stating this simple reality, imo, is much bigger then simply stating that they need to get sagas rolling and out the door consistently before they can allocate more resources to more hardcore aspects of the game.
---
Stop talking out of your ass people..This isn't a new issue. It's been going on for years. This is not an indie company. They completely ignored WvW and PvP for literal years.
---
Ah yes fair, I'm not from the US so my knowledge of "special" days off (or whatever they are called there) is rather limited there :p
---
Probably easier to animate more expressive speech.
---
Most of the people dont harass devs, don't send death threats or bully individuals. People that don't do this cannot do anything about it either. If you're getting death threats you should go call police instead of posting it on twitter. Stop whitewashing she should explain this embarassment which took place few days ago.
---
Because it's a niche game mode for a very small playerbase and we have strike missions now.
---
I'm sorry? I'm being toxic? And how am I "shitting" on the work already being done? All I'm saying is that we should report things as soon as we see abusive behaviour. Nowhere am I saying the moderators aren't doing a good enough job, but if anything in my post suggest anything near it I apologize deeply. I don't doubt that the moderators put in a lot of effort, and I'm thankful for that.
---
But yes, *we need* to fix abuse issues as we are part of the problem - us players and the community. The way we fix it is by calling the abuse out, not just downvoting it to the bottom of the comments section. I'm not only taking about Reddit. But I have zero idea how the forum situation looks like, as I never go there - my idea of forums in general are more support-related like hardware issues and I personally haven't had the need.
---
By doing so we take a harder stance against this intolerable behaviour. And we do need to do so, as this is a very common problem is the game dev industry. Just look at Jennifer Scheurle's Twitter page. I'm using her again as an example of a (prominent) game dev industry personality whom have taken a lot of abuse over the years, and have taken action now because of the rising abusive behaviour on the backside of the announcement last Friday. Unfortunately for her she can't make her profile private, because she's Twitter validated.
---
How am I the bad one in this, again?
---
the backlash is because they didn't announce anything we didn't already know. where's the "expansion type features without an expansion"? wheres the wvw update? whens the pvp update? they literally told us nothing and hyped it up so much and for what? a 5 minute announcement they could have written in a blog post? and how do you go from shitting on valve for no transparency to saying anet should just keep quiet? lol the whole announcement was just an attempt to "stay relevant" with WoW Classic release.
---
I like to remain hopeful for hardcore players, but I'm not surprised they wouldn't stick around. Raids are likely coming, but at what pace? If there would be a new one soon, they would have announced it by now, because they should know that side of the community is dropping off.
---
Instead, they announce a dumbed-down version of raids. I mean, the raiding community has been praising the harder raid sections, such as Dhuum CM (which many believe is more difficult than design originally intended). And they come out with that! Maybe they're hoping to bridge some kind of gap between casual and hardcore?
---
unless by casuals you mean braindead eles making 3k dps, maybe. but if you can play your class half decently and have the mechanics explained to you for 5 minutes, the raids are very doable. i dont know how you could make them easier for casuals.
---
except fractals blow and metas are boring. Dungeons are fun and was the best content this game has ever provided, with raids being a close second
---
It's absolutely none of your business.
---
Im gunna say no because theyre not going to put effort after 7 years of not putting effort
---
Could've just stay silent like they always do
---
[Personally I don't think anyone wants to work in an unhealthy environment just because someone says "it's your job"](https://www-forbes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2018/11/16/new-research-shows-just-how-bad-social-media-can-be-for-mental-health/amp/)
---
I used to be a social media coordinator. It sucks. A lot. After a while you just throw up your hands and say "this is not worth it". It's like answering phone calls from customers multiple times a minute all day except now the words are staring you in the face.
---
&gt; Because it paints the picture that the entire community is behaving this way,
---
It doesn't.
---
What are they being payed for if you don't mind me asking then?   
---
Those 10 are there PAYED to look at all that cancer and filter the important shit to the devs. And right now what your saying is it has grown SO INCREDIBLY toxic they don't even wanna do their jobs? That to me only says one single thing and it isn't that magically 99% of the community became hostile shitters, no that tells me they actually fucked up so hard and are playing the victim card and are indeed labeling every criticism as "toxic and non-constructive" because that's what people like you and them like to do.   
---
And if SHE REALLY IS talking about the shitty 1% then WHY is she talking about them instead of the shit that is ACTUALLY important?  
---
I'm done, they did this a million times and ass-kissers like you always support them, instead of talking about the actual game and adressing the concerns and criticism they play their victiom-card and make it all about harrasment or sexism or whatever fucking else as long as it isn't about the actual game and their development.   
---
I just want you to understand, you are literally making excuses for people NOT doing their job because it's "toxic" when they were literally hired to deal with shit like this, you are defending people who historically have been doing a fucking terrible job at community-anything. That only tells me these guys don't have the skills or thick-skin to even do this job, I mean, obviously...
---
I wish they kept the monetization model guild wars 1 had.
---
I don't get this either. I mean I'm sorry but I'm nowhere near great/perfect at the game and still do raids/fracs
---
because you have to unlock them?
---
&gt; That doesn't prevent you from addressing legitimate complaints or even positive players ("You liked this patch? Wait till you see the next one!")
---
addressing positive feedbacks without addressing the negative only feeds the ire of the playerbase
---
addressing the negative feedbacks takes a lot of time because you don't want to take the risk of miscommunication, do people really expect a well thought out feedback over a disappointing announcement over the weekend?
---
&gt;Firstly, it's completely reasonable for players to ask when we are getting content like new fractals, new elite specs, etc. Those are the majority of the reason I personally play, so that is information I need.
---
&gt;Secondly, call me a radical, but "Businesses can't operate with integrity and transparency, because it could reduce profits somehow!" falls on very deaf ears for me. It's usually false, and to the extent that it is true that open and clear communication would harm a business, well, that's how free markets work. To get into the weeds a bit, the theoretical model which states that market forces help everyone is a mathematical fact, but relies on several assumptions, one of which is perfect information. Lying, to include by omission, outright attacks the foundation of our economy.
---
that's not how stackeholder driven business work, you have a naive vision of your economy, the system is rigged, not fair and open
---
&gt;Also, many, many businesses across a wide variety of industries are straight with their customers.
---
A game as a service will never tell you straight "yeah we can't tell you when the thing you like will come back" because there whole strategy is retention... the comparison to a bbq joint is ludicrous
---
you don't have to like it, I'm not arguing that the model is fair for the consumer
---
The only new thing from that list is the pvp armor set. Everything else was announced year/over a year ago. And we still have no idea when any of that is coming btw.
---
I'm glad this sub is finally waking up to realize the poor state this game is in instead of plugging their ears and being like carebears.
---
I can actually relate to people on the sub now instead of feeling like I'm crazy for being the only one complaining about the game
---
Same. This is the best MMO I’ve ever played but right now I’m not sure if I still feel that anymore.
---
Don’t like it don’t play it!!
---
*People leave*
---
Idk why people say this game is dying!!
---
The thing is...   
---
Raids are more or less dead.   
---
Most of the people who were raiding went to ff, bdo, or are grinding classic. Some, just like me and my guild decided we don't give a damn anymore and will just come for ls releases and play just the way Anet wants us to play the game. There's simply not enough people to keep the community alive, because I'm damn sure casuals won't command teams because they themselves don't know how to play.   
---
Also, you may say that strikes, or however they called those bosses, might be an introduction.   
---
They won't. Raids have failstates, dps checks, and so on. If strikes are to be entry level, and thus achievable for a casual who just joins an instance that's not full, they can't be a stepping stone for raids, because they'll keep the difficulty level a world boss possesses, just scaled down to 10 people.
---
This kind of comment is the reason I stopped working as a social media coordinator. No one could pay me enough to suffer verbal abuse all day again. Not happening.
---
Since it has almost no servers I can imagine that it probably pays for itself in purchases and active players buying stuff from rhe store.
---
&gt;After the conference thing it’s painfully clear the message that ANet is sending: There won’t be any challenging content
---
We actually don't know that yet.
---
It's a shitty conference. Like, probably their worst in their entire history as a company. 
---
But we still don't know yet. 
---
Personally, I'm actually optimistic because of Strike Squads. They are finally bridging the gap for normal players to get into raids, which means they are keeping that mode of content in mind as they design them.
---
lol 7 years doomed. Some might call that successful.
---
Older wings have already been repeated way too often to feel fresh again to the vast majority of groups who actually do them, even with additional difficulties.
---
Systems like instabilities should be kept out though. They're a reason people don't do Fractals, and forcing them into raids would not make them better.
---
and then, everyone who made a thread here and said he/she is okay with the announcement and is excited about TIS, gets downvoted into oblivion.
---
Word, I don't see the point. Go play sims
---
Yep I quit a while ago for the same reason and poked my head in to see if this new announcement hooked me back but NOPE lol back to OSRS it is
---
She is payed to be a community manager, did a shit job for years and is now crying about "abuse and toxicity" at a time where there's major backlash with the game.  
---
She is literally QQ-ing on her personal twitter how her job is shit. Indeed a shit job choice for her
---
&gt; the backlash is because they didn't announce anything we didn't already know. where's the "expansion type features without an expansion"? wheres the wvw update? whens the pvp update?
---
They aren't telling you because the announcement would result in troves of entitled babyrage. If they were honest and just said 'the numbers and player activity don't add up compared to other content so it's taking a backseat" then entitled babies would throw a tantrum for days. Maintaining silence is a strategic choice in an era of entitlement and pitchfork mentalities.
---
Both SquareEnix and Blizzard have and own the rights to several other successful games.
---
I mean, gw2 Asura I can see, gw1 Asura maybe. But Asura used to look much more creepy and less cutesy (in a good way imo) in gw1.
---
What is your setup? For tripple monitor you should use your videocards driver to create a "surround" setup
---
it was a general assessment of the video game communities, but yes readdit tends to be less aweful 
---
unfortunately I also have to look at facebook, youtube, discords...
---
&gt;The whole "omg toxis is uberwhealmin" seems to reak of bullshit, and getting exploited as an excuse to not adress proper well deservec critism.
---
I'm telling you that it's something I leave through my work, that it's rough, and your answer is "reak of bullshit"...
---
I'd argue that this lack of empathy fosters toxicity
---
I understand Rubi but it was the right to say at the wrong time. These tweets were posted immediately after the annoucement recieved backlash so ofcourse the community are going to connect them with constructive feedback. If she means other incidents then she needs to specify.
---
500 deleted posts is a drop in the bucket. THERE ARE 215,000 PEOPLE WITH 215,000 OPINIONS SUBBED TO THIS THREAD. DO THE MATH
---
They really aren't easy. They just feel easy for people doing them a lot. Noobs are overwhelmed by having to do watch like four different mechanics that will kill you and maybe even wipe the entire squad, pull decent numbers, position yourself, learn the animations, and a ton of other shit.
---
It's kind of like PvP. You die and have no idea why. You can't learn that way and it's not fun. By tuning the numbers and creating an easy mode you create a positive learning experience that allows people to tackle higher and higher difficulties without slamming face-first into a wall of fuck you that's why.
---
Getting belittled as braindead doesn't help the cause of raiders as well and just cements their image of toxic elitists.
---
The kind of casual he’s replying to is the “I shouldn’t have to invest in good gear to do the hardest raids” type of casual
---
That's the concern, I'm sure that even the hardcore of the raiders would not want to do 10+ wings. There will be groups that do, but I would assume that it would be a low percentage.
---
From the announcement, it seems they’re adding strike missions to try and bridge the gap between content difficulty to hopefully grow the community that completes challenging content so they can actually justify spending dev time on said challenging content. This may be NCSoft forcing them to focus on things that people do instead of wasting dev time. Not exactly something they can come out as say “hey no one cares about raids so NCSoft said fuck y’all.” 
---
I understand it will be a while. I hope the challenging content does happen. 
---
But then again for me it doesn’t matter, I don’t have time for the challenging content anymore. Haven’t raided since W4.
---
What you're saying is like:
---
1. I bought your 1st game.
---
2. I bought your 2nd game. 
---
3. Your 3rd game is out, I didn't buy it, and it's been on the market for 2 years now.
---
4. You suddenly release a collection with the whole trilogy for the same price as the 3rd game. I already paid more than the 3rd game, why don't you give it to me for free then?
---
It makes no sense to me. They rewarded veteran with a (shitty) package, because you bought HoT. You're a veteran HoT. But to them, you stopped supporting the game since you didn't buy PoF. They don't owe you the expansion you decided you didn't want to buy.
---
people leaving would only be a problem, if there werent new people coming, which isnt the case.
---
Read my full comment, I think you'll find we're on the same page.
---
Earlier this week i was asking the discord what gw2 branded things anet will come up with next after the leggings and wristwatch. Memed into reality is an understatement
---
Only ANet knows for sure, but I strongly doubt the game is selling that well. If it were still lucrative, ANet would probably promote it more. Now it's just bugfixes and occasional minor updates from one or 2 devs in total.
---
Pretty convinced ArenaNet hates this idea. Don't ask me why but I'm pretty sure. They don't like re-visiting old content. The only exception are fractal instabilities but they were designed that way from the start.
---
*sigh*
---
"Do you tghink I'm going to create a compilation of 500.000 deleted posts?"
---
There. Now you can address the point instead the flaw in my example.
---
We do not have an official answer, but lets be real: All of the questions can be answered pretty accurate.  
---
*1.) Are there raids beeing developed a this moment, or is w7 the last for now?*  
---
New Raid is being worked on, BUT it will take a lot of time! (9 months probably)
---
*2.) Are there any Fractals (reworks / Cms/ new ones) beeing developped at the moment?*  
---
Yes to fractals, no to CMs. They have stated that they are not doing fractal CMs at all anymore.
---
*3.) Are there any plans on providing cm's for the strike missions?*  
---
Most certainly not since they said that fractals CMs were a big mistake so they wont do them anywhere except raids.
---
*4.) Will WvW get a competititve Structure in anyway (Leagues/World Bonuses from winning/Access to special Terretory for winning ect.)?*  
---
No. The WvW Team is small and there are way deeper problems than a new feature. You would have to fix the balance and server structuring first. 
---
*5.) Are there any plans for an expansion?*  
---
No. They said that LS5 has xpac content so they wouldn't have to do that. And before they produce another expansion and commit to another 2-3 year of service they most likely will move on to another project. GW3 or whatever that would be called.
---
*6.) Are there any plans for new elite Specs?*  
---
No. They most likely were plans for this but have been dumped when they decided to not make another xpac.
---
*7.) Are new mounts beeing worked on?*  
---
Yes. Absolutly. They will bring a new mount in LS5. First and formost to tell the players, see we provided xpac content like a mount, and secondly to make more skins for it. And the skin topic is not a flame. It's financially very smart thing to do and people want it.
---
*8.) Are there any plans in having long term progression for more hardcore / veteran players to keep them playing (besides goldsinks) like the dragon bash arena till level 99?*  
---
No. They will not cater towards those types of players.   
---
**Like they always say: "judge us by what we ship".** And since they are not talking, you have to draw conclusion by yourself.
---
&gt; I agree Guild Wars 2 isn't a good place for raiders and that may well be true for PvPers and WvWers as well.
---
&gt; But this kind of statement is one of the biggest problems I see on reddit pretty much constantly. People assuming their demographic is THE demographic. Hint, it's not. There are people playing this game every single day and enjoying it, including vets. Saying it's not in a good place is part of the problem. It's not in a good place to you, and people who play like you.
---
Even that is making the mistake you are pointing out. Lots of people who PvP, WvW and raid are happy right now. Lots of people who PvE are unhappy. No one group has a monopoly on dissatisfaction, in fact I don't think think it's even accurate to talk about types of content as having single groups that play them - most players play a variety of content.
---
One of the biggest fallacies going around now is that certain types of content are somehow winning the victim Olympics - they are getting mistreated or marginalized, while everything is a candy land of rainbows, puppies and kittens for other players. It's a false narrative.l
---
I got mine. It looks like some bacon fat strapped to your back though.
---
&gt;unfortunately I also have to look at facebook, youtube, discords..
---
Sure, lets play with your game. Can you give me a couple of popular youtube videos that are toxic and abusive toward anet about the announcement?
---
&gt;I'd argue that this lack of empathy fosters toxicity
---
I'd argue that dickriding companies fosters lazyness.
---
No your just legitimately dumb, from the beginning you have no idea what your talking about and I'm pretty sure you aren't even informed about this shituation in general.   
---
If I tell you you have cancer, you ask me how much you have left to live and I tell you "eh a good amount tbh" and that's it, that's not fucking sufficient information is there?   
---
And let's not even talk about the ever popular "you have cancer" "how much do I have left?" "right then, I'd like to talk about that bad back of yours... never mind the cancer now" which is a staple of these devs.   
---
Consider alternatives
---
Because its literally their job to do so. As the consumer we pay their salaries and they should do their best to deliver something that is worth our money. I don't believe harassment and death threats are EVER legitimated, but the vast majority kept their feedback on an acceptable level, even if it was very negative. 
---
In most other businesses like restaurants or shops etc. if the majority of customers tells them that their service is bad and we bring up x or y things, that could improve it, they would try their best to improve it. 
---
I understand that a company like Anet can't please everyone, but a large part of the clients being unhappy should raise at least enough red flags to take immediate actions to reduce some of the pressure. It's not like we demand all our wishes to be fulfilled immediately but just give us some information we actually care about. Their announcement could have been a great success if there was something like " this sage will also contain a new elite spec" or " WvW updates coming this year". Something solid, not the announcement of an announcement. Bethesda did something similar to this, when they announced Elder Scrolls Blades. They anticipated backlash so they put a little teaser for TESO 6 at the end of their presentation and it worked, because the audience knew that, while their next product wouldn't be made for them, they weren't left in the dust with nothing to look forward too.
---
I hope they do release an expansion at some point because that's the only way I'm able to financially support this game.  I don't buy cosmetics at all in games.
---
i play this game for 2 years, have complete raid legendary armor set, all fractals including cms almost everyday and near 10k AP.. I dont know, it's feel boring to play same thing, and have to wait very long time for new release content. I really miss this game if im leaving . But seems like the more im waiting, the more im hurt. Recent annoucement is my peak of waiting. i will move on to that square enix mmo games for now since most of you guys recommend that.
---
I've seen a lot of people acting like they would be satisfied with any news.  
---
But I ask everyone this, what if ANet said things would continue as usual?    
---
Have you been satisfied with:  
---
9-12 months between raid releases?  
---
6-9 months between fractal releases?  
---
How PvP and WvW have been treated?  
---
Prior to this debacle, the answer has been a resounding no.  
---
The reason ANet hasn't communicated, is because they have nothing to say. They have never properly supported these areas of the game, and they still don't plan to.
---
They would would have basically redo backs into a new thing because the data structure of backs didn't have data allotted for dye channels. Same for weapons.  
---
Maybe they'll replace them with a new restructured item with dye data aloted, like when they replaced town clothes with outfits, so they may have figured out a way to do it one each character as they get loaded, like when gear with selectable stats gets their stat reset on load after an update that affects the lists of stats in those items.  
---
Load a chararacter, los  your item, get one exactly the same, but with dye data.
---
i mean they are getting that anyway?
---
I'm curious, how deep in the lore must you be invested to really enjoy RP ? (It's a purely naïve question, no sarcasm/troll/etc. I used to do tabletop RPG and just curious on how it works in GW2)
---
I'm not sure the raid community is large enough to support that any more - if the harder modes had better rewards it would split the community, and if they didn't... well it's not like people are doing CMs regularly.
---
&gt;Your complaint isn't actually valid.
---
A: It's not a complaint, I'm pointing out the tremendous work ANet has forced themselves to do, due to the precedent the game was built on.
---
B: How is it not valid?  Big, detailed areas, with smatterings of 2-3 mobs, is not content. It's a giant sink of development resources. 
---
&gt;Mounts provides the ability to skip past these things, yes, but it's not really a waste if you had no intention of stopping to participate in the first place.
---
That is literally my point.  Mounts enhance the ability to skip these meaningless areas that players don't even use.  You say "participate", implying im talking about event areas, which I'm not.
---
Wing 8 is guaranteed not to come with the introduction of Strike Missions. Fractal/Raid team consists of 3 people.
---
&gt;The majority of gamers are actually pretty understanding
---
The state of this subreddit this weekend disagrees.  The event was overhyped, yeah, and people are _way_ overreacting to it.
---
Yeah but they are open world, and probably more like bounties.
---
....those comments are tame and unexceptional 
---
If you think that is what constitutes being toxic then you live in a alternate reality that the majority of us don't want to visit.
---
Final Fantasy XIV is waiting for all of you.
---
Do you have any sources regarding the “abandonment of GW2” resources are bound to be consumed more on new projects vs existing projects as all the systems, tools, assets and expertise are there compared to starting from scratch. Losing 100+ people is bound to cause a lot of internal issues as staff are reorganised etc. They lost a lot of good talent in the layoffs and probably irreplaceable expertise (some of them had been working at anet since GW Prophecies release). I’m not defending arenanet entirely and I think they need to be a lot clearer communication wise (this has been an on-going issue for about 6 years now) but this hyperbolic end times echo chamber is nuts.
---
Clearly the majority of players dont agree, given that Fractals during dungeons prime were a lot more popular than dungeons are now, despite having been *far* less rewarding. And frankly, I also personally disagree. Dungeons sucked. It was just stack and burst, with no interesting gameplay. Hell, you even skipped most of the dungeon just because it was that boring and you wanted to maximize efficiency. And while it was a pretty set-piece, the fact that it had to be non-canon meant the stories werent interesting *or* relevant. As far as the games plot is concerned, they didnt exist.
---
&gt; Can you give me a couple of popular youtube videos that are toxic and abusive toward anet about the announcement?
---
again, I was talking about my situation working as a producer NOT FOR ARENANET
---
and youtube toxicity is mostly comments
---
&gt;I'd argue that dickriding companies fosters lazyness.
---
no toxicity to be seen anywhere yeah... maybe you don't know what being toxit is
---
This is really baffling to me, so far I've heard raider asking for an easy mode on raids to help people get in, some other don't like this idea. But never have I ever heard people asking for an easy raid, they want normal raids with an easy mode (and hopefully a CM). They either missed the point or failed to communicate again.
---
Normally restaurants would discipline or fire someone over bad service. I don't think Anet has that option, or even finds it necessary. Terminating anyone involved in certain projects at this point is only going to delay those projects further. 
---
I think we'll probably get a reply back from the team next week when everyone is back from vacation, but I wouldn't expect it to be too indepth. "Yes this is planned." "Yes this is coming." "No we are not currently working on that right now" etc.
---
Take elite specs for example. I expected them to be mentioned, but they weren't. My guess is that they are not currently planned for the first couple episodes of the saga, but they may be added later when there are more new hero points in the new maps (if there are any at all). Maybe they are still holding off on them for even longer. But I do not expect Anet to say "no we are not releasing any new elite specs going forward". So I'm just going to wait.
---
Remember, if someone is talking in generalities, and you have not done the thing being claimed. Then it is safe to assume that the someone is not talking about you.
---
The internet is weird, but remember, for the most part, in an open post without much context. It probably isn't about you. You are a but 1 of millions that interact on the internet.
---
Also, I highly highly doubt, that the reasons the lack of game's evolution, and lack of content changes, has been due to them ignoring feedback.
---
-
---
... So lets go down on a tangent...
---
Taking feedback is easy, and a lack of taking feedback is an easy problem to fix. Implementing feedback however, is a wholly different story and involves how their team and technology is situated.
---
Sure, the optimist would say, oh, they just have to fix simple problems. The realist, says, engine looks rough. There are server bugs that never change, such as events getting stuck with a multitude of permutations or reasons (the other day a temple of melandru escort even was stuck and I simply assumed a enemy fell through the floor, shrugged it off and moved on, not even caring to report it).
---
As an outsider who can't get an in depth look at how well their systems work, I can't say that their engine and systems have stymied their ability to evolve and improve their game. But, I have tidbits, like GW2 is actually an expanded GW1 project that was re-rolled into a new game because of how far they pushed and updated the old game. We know they aren't updating the graphics API because, something something core engine... code etc etc... (to which I, deep down ponder, ohhhh the code is a mess). These aren't factual, but theses are the fears. Fears that this game simply won't support major revisions to how things work, at least without an inordinate amount of effort by developers.
---
I don't believe that the developers are intentionally ignoring are feedback. I certainly don't think they are dismissing feedback due to some issues with how the community interacts. I think the problems are much worse. I think they can't even get their own visions on the game implemented, let alone start to incorporate player feedback.
---
It's an easy fix though, with weekly rotations of extra rewards and the most recent one always being extra rewarding too (like the current system). It's definitely not a reason not to release more raids.
---
They seem to be making up the harassment they supposedly receive anyway. Unless they consider "shit decision" or "dying game" harassment.
---
Because the most difficult thing for raids is not the mechanics but the ability to find 9 more people.
---
&gt; Is there an expansion in the works or is one being planned for?
---
LS5 will last 1,5-2 years. Even if there is an expansion in work or planned, it's still *way* too early to talk about it. You should ask in about a year.
---
&gt; WvW alliances
---
Well, they said "we didn't forget you". It's not the answer we wanted, but it's an answer. 
---
&gt; Expansion-level features(?) like elite specializations
---
It looks like people can't think of anything else than elite specs, when they talk about expansion level features. I mean we got new mounts, we will get new raid-like 10 player content, we still get raids (to think it's abandoned is just baseles speculation). 
---
Also talking about especs would either spoiler future stuff (a planned expansion for example) or cause even more questions and speculations and people would do the same with the new questions.
---
&gt; Raids - talk openly about a raid being worked on
---
To think that they stopped working on raids (same with fractals) is just baseless and stupid, sorry. 
---
There is absolutely no reason to stop. Because "PoF aera ended"? THat's no reason, also since the announcement we know that LS5 will require PoF. 
---
Brining new raids always took several months and the last release is ("only") 3 month ago. They never used to confirm that they work on a raid at any time in the past, there is no reason for it to be necessary now. 
---
Also the new strike missions are a very big hint that raids definitely are not abandoned. They introduced strike missions literally as easy mode raids -&gt; something raiders *and* casuals wanted for a long time to get more people into raids / get into raids. It just makes no sense to bring more players into raids, if they abandon them.
---
I don't know when this extreme anxiety of loosing raids began, but it's totally exaggerated and the only arguments are either baseless or very weak.
---
Well, that's what we kno so far. Of course not the answers you wanted, but we are not as uninformated as you may think. Even without a direct "yes" or "no" from Anet.
---
They haven't released an official statement yet because its the holiday weekend.  I imagine we'll get something from them on Tuesday.
---
Also worth noting this WASN'T an official statement, this was someone saying something on Twitter.
---
It's called reflects, drop the hammer has a 2 second wind-up with a humongous telegraph, and CoR only does meaningful damage from a distance. I'm far more concerned by the damage I'm taking in the frontline from scourge shade bombs and warriors+guardians.
---
8k rev hammer auto is with full 25 might stacks, on full berzerker gear, against targets with 25 vulnerability, on targets with barely any toughness. Stop the shitty hyperbole.
---
I'm sorry but how can you not learn from raids ? If I run into Sabetha's flame wall I die. Are you telling me people aren't able to make that logical connection after they die to it, especially when they do so over and over again ? Because at that point it really is on them and they might have some sort of learning disability. Not shitting on people who do btw, it's just anyone else should be able to draw conclusions as simple as that one.
---
GvG was a blast in GW1
---
I like most of your other points, especially fractals
---
Fair enough i was on the whole Thing that started this debate since thats where they could/should have talked more about all aspects and the Future.
---
Twitter surley would be the wrong place but they are silent everywhere :(
---
Ruby Bayer further dodges the actual issue and continues clarifying a problem only addressed to a small percentage of the community. Rubi, no one cares.
---
These huge areas that players apparently skip over don't actually exist. Mounts allow people to move past content that they don't need to do but there are still some people in those areas completing the content.
---
Raids ded? Lul I just did 4 wongs with pugs trainings this week
---
yah cuz some games have potential and we somewhat enjoy it, i mean might as well just not leave amazon reviews when some people might enjoy it
---
Seeing housing in other MMOs and what they could do with it would be great for Gw2. Wildstar for example had awesome housing system. Etc.
---
Well everyone doesn’t agree because the bullshit abuse still continues. And if you think what she was saying was somehow saying they don’t need to pay attention to fair criticism your reading comprehension needs work. Her statement was purely in regards to people behaving badly and not being fair. 
---
The reason they respond more quickly to that is because for one thing it doesn’t require any complex response. “People behaving terribly stop being shitty” is pretty simple to put out there and doesn’t require action on Anet’s part. 
---
However, responding to fair criticism often requires either revealing things or a promise of what they can do to fix it. Both of those things take time to be decided because there’s legal things which are involved, NDAs are a thing, and the PR team doesn’t decide what the company does. Even the people who do make the choices have to talk to various people before a choice is made so yea... that takes time.
---
That's a really sad comment from a really sad person...
---
why is it removed -.-
---
Believe it or not, but people are so overwhelmed that they don't even see the bloody flamewall and just drop dead and go wut? Next time they forget about the bloody jump. Then they forget about X. Then Y. Four hours later your group of ten noobs just cycles through whoever fucks shit up NEXT.
---
Imagine people *not* enjoying that. It's like bitching at Pokemon players for not enjoying Dark Souls.
---
Dumbing that down will allow them to get their foot into the door.
---
what are you even referencing you low-effort sperg
---
No Mursaat made her to do so.
---
That was her own thing.
---
What?  No she didn't.  All she said was "please do not personally attack the game devs or other members of the community".
---
Show me in her tweets where she blamed the community for overhyping their announcement, I'll wait.
---
If they add something that shitty, lazy and random as instabilities to raids, they are in a worse spot than they are right now. Instead: just make new Raids that have the base difficulty and quality of W1 or W2, and make CMs that are comparable to W5 CM.. Make Strike missions as easy-mode raid encounters, but add CMs to them that make them at least comparable to W4 or W6 CM encounters..
---
I don't want to sound cynical or anything, but I do want to share my negative side of that, despite how good the idea sounds. So Raids are unique and singular content, designed to be challenging next to the rest 95% of the content. It is supposed to represent the peak of combat mechanics and teamwork. Giving the time and effort to learn and adapt to beat the raid wing feels some much more rewarding than just asking ANET to tune them down. It makes you feel like you surpassed the average player, and makes you feel special because you just beat the content most players didn't, and you got the rewards. 
---
Regarding how those changes might affect the community: The splitting into difficulties will imo result in Raid community splitting as well, and the mechanics. 
---
Lets take Vale Guardian for example. Lets imagine Raids have 3 difficulties: Easy, Normal and CM. Now you have to split every boss' mechanics into 3 different levels to satisfy the scaling of the Raiding community. New players start will Easy, learn the basics and most will probably just stay on that level probably because higher levels are just "too challenging". Majority of the Raid community will most likely be on Normal, and the minority will play CM and you just created a 3 way split in the Raid community, each one looking down at the ones below. 
---
So, from our current position where major problems are:
---
 - vets who are bored
---
 - casuals who never have time or don't want to give the effort to prepare for Raids
---
we got to:
---
 - having the devs do 3x more work on single boss for 3 difficulty levels
---
 - segmented the already busted Raid community into 3 groups
---
This just doesn't seem to be worth it rly, and it might do more harm than fixing the issues.
---
I will just close this with the following: Raids aren't *that* hard to get into. Casuals who probably do a few metas and WB's per day get sufficient mats to make some basic exotic and ascended gear with the right stats. There is plenty of training guilds running several training sessions per week that will literally just walk you through the bosses step by step, and trust me when I say that the reward will be worth it.
---
Peace o7
---
The technology is not there yet.
---
I assumed they all went to FFXIV actually, I know the raiding scene in FFXIV got a sudden injection of new blood.
---
Raids are dead either way. Hardcores are bored out of their minds, casuals won't touch them. If you have casuals flood the gamemode, at least you have a base to regrow the population. Exclusivity will not fix the gamemode. Look at what it did to WvW. The most important rule for every competetive gamemode is to keep fresh blood coming in.
---
Of course it's not dead, it's just that a lot of players/groups, static or not, have move on to other games. There will alway be some group that still do it.
---
There is a difference between criticizm and demands, insults and threats.
---
I think you vastly underestimate how long those things take if you think that it means players have played to much, maxing out crafting only takes a day or two. Masteries a week or two at best even if playing a few hours a day, living story just like crafting only takes a day, theirs only so much pvp you can do before the grind for high ranks becomes boring as hell and is completely pointless to do (this goes for spvp and wvw as wvw as so few things to put your points into that after a while your maxed out), most achievements they add nowadays are just gold/time sinks that only take longer because of their drive to add things that you can only get once per day. I agree that taking a break can be healthy if your burnt out, but if they don’t add any meaningful content you’ll have no reason to come back and “face the ravages of tyran”. The only reason I even play still is because of my guild, and we’ve gotten to the point where we are all willing to play other games together so who knows how much longer that will last
---
Fractals are great and all but new instanced content with unique rewards is totally different.
---
Also fractals are bound to be short while dungeons could be made longer and bigger with more unique encounters etc.
---
The bots invading ranked is such a fucking embarrassment.
---
I had a game once with 3 bots in it. The fact that Anet allows this to happen is infuriating.
---
I mean I'm not saying it's lucrative, I'm saying it probably makes them money.
---
I am simply laughing that you think there has been any transparency with them at all. Of that you imply that there was transparency in this event at all, and they you are too thick to even grasp that.
---
I used to work in a kinda-smallish company as both a support and a forum moderator/official representative. I also worked as a social media monitoring specialist/analyst for several companies. 
---
It sucks sometimes, but you just need to grow a thick skin. I agree that this is not a job for everyone. But I can't in clear conscience call it TERRIBLE looking in the eyes of my friend who is a doctor, for example.
---
I think you overestimate how many would try WvW. Most players' problem with WvW is the gameplay, not the matchmaking.  It's mindless, shallow, repetitive zerging and nothing about alliances would change that.
---
First positive comment!
---
Cool, I always appreciate more slots for my most-played alts.
---
The thing that's unfair is using the problems within the gaming industry as an excuse to evade being called out for shitty behavior :/
---
That's becuse it's not happening to them so there is no problem.
---
I mean, even WP wasn't keen on that annoucement, and he usually keeps his more critical opinions to streams, so I cannot imagine how he feels towards the game off air.
---
Oh I would probably agree with easy modes (with less rewards) in order to get more people in, I just worry about splitting the current playerbase.
---
gemstore refunds?? yea right... if anything it's more likely for future gemstore backpacks.
---
Sorry, you're right. I even forgot the negation. "If Arena hadn't say anything, your guild would have waited more."
---
This line of thought it also used when a casual wants it to explain why xpacs aren’t needed. Once you call them out for it, you get “it’s a free update, what else did you expect?”
---
I'm not even gonna click that
---
Lolllllllllll... sure they were.
---
You don't pay their salaries, Anet does. just as you don't pay a grocery store employee's salaries.
---
The fact that you say that kinda proves my point of it being a waste.  Because if you would have ever stopped and actually looked at the extra detail they've put into the map you wouldn't say that. 
---
A large portion of the human leveling area is detailed and ultimately empty.  
---
Over half of Lion's Arch is unnecessary.  
---
The vast majority of underwater areas are unused and meaningless. 
---
The amount of little areas to jump to which actually lead nowhere in HoT is enormous. 
---
The sweeping sand dunes in PoF, empty.
---
The list goes on and on.
---
To be hones it's hard to blame the devs. They are used to zealots defending anything a company does. to them this is quite a radical change.
---
tl;dr caterpillars are not worms
---
i care about entomology it's not rly relevant to the joke
---
The no notice layoffs made that clear.
---
Its always better to use existing stuff and tune it instead of always making new stuff and forget about old stuff, but thats just my opinion.
---
I mean everything is there allrdy you only have to fix it.
---
she was talking in general about the industry as a whole. Did you miss the Fortnite, Apex, and League drama in the past few weeks? Toxicity (warranted or otherwise) to devs has been endemic in the last period and its been kinda crazy lmao
---
its the world restructuring that would come with it that would make the difference. it was always understood that they needed to come at the same time. i cant play with any of my friends who bought the game because of path of fire because they had to join different servers, each of them. the servers need to go entirely, the megaserver system hurt the in game communities to the point where the communities are only really sustained by as much effort outside the game. there are a handful of guild ive seen from launch that are still here today, from wvw and such. wvw is the next endgame to me, a non-hardcore pve player. raids are their own flavor of endgame that i am not ready to spend the money on gearing myself for, but i cant tell you how many times ive invited people standing right next to me in game that i couldnt play wvw with even though we both wanted to, it just hurts
---
I wanted to show you own example, but it was just deleted, because the mods are doing their job. 
---
There is a lot of that, not jut one in one thousand. Plus all the the stuff the dev receive directly.  
---
And can’t you understand it’s not about excuses?People are receiving death threats. This has to stop.
---
I called it day one. Why would they release elite specs for free, or without an expansion? Reddit would say: "New elite specs, for what content? Content is boring!". I knew this community would hype itself up.
---
They're not putting *women* on a pedestal. They do nothing but curse, belittle, and defame women. The thing that incels worship is the *idea* *of a relationship* (albeit a heavily one-sided one): the idea of a woman being sexually attracted to them, respecting them, fulfilling them physically and emotionally, propping up their fragile little egos, etc. 
---
That is a *far* cry from putting the women themselves on a pedestal -- in fact, it's the very opposite.
---
I'd say wish in one hand and piss in the other but you're way ahead on the former.
---
I am sure you have WvW experience, and have played the mode often. At that point it definitely makes sense to roam and get the mount pretty fast. Look at it from the perspective of someone entirely new to the gamemode (maybe even to gw2 in general) though: 
---
\- They won't have the best build/gear so they stand little chance going around solo roaming, they'll just get killed whenever they meet an enemy roamer. Roaming is not really something a new, inexperienced(!) player can do effectively. You need at least map knowledge, knowledge of WvW and some means of fending off or escaping from enemies. Escape is impossible when the enemy has a mount.
---
\- Joining the zerg, the other alternative, might be great for a new player, except their experience will be: Command + 90% of the Zerg mounts up on warclaws and run off, the rest gets left behind. They might persist and run after the zerg anyway but they will feel alone and will always be late to the party. 
---
Both of these situations do not sound like the best new player experience into WvW to me. 
---
Now consider that \*many\* MMO players only have a few hours each day to spend on a game. They have jobs, families, and obligations, leaving them little time to sit down and really learn the gamemode's ins and outs. They have to get excited first, and \*then\* they'll try to learn. It doesn't work if they have to constantly fail and learn and stick to something they are not excited about, until they finally "get it" and then do get excited. Right now,  WvW is just not made for 95% or more of the **casual** playerbase, which is a pity since that's most of the GW2 players.
---
At the end of the day I'm just guessing here, but I've given it a fair bit of thought. I don't know why Elite Specs haven't been discussed and it would not surprise me if they got mentioned in the coming weeks if/when ANet addresses the current outcry. As a reminder, it's Labor Day weekend and approximately everyone is on vacation so don't expect anything until Tuesday at the very earliest.
---
mate, dont do this to yourself. elite specs are so much work that there's no way they wouldnt at least be mentioned in that announcement. while there have been things like mounts introduced as a surprise in lws 4 (which btw noone expected, everyone thought theyd only come with an expac), the chance for elite specs is low.
---
anet is bad at hyping their own shit up (the past summer for example, theyve consistently been dropping content but with very little hype), but theres no way they wouldnt have mentioned elite specs. raids, fractals, maybe, but elite specs no.
---
A lot of people likes to get on the moral highground and look down at others and tell them to "Stop complaining lol", "its a free game". It's just an epidemic at this point. Sure if GW2 is like your #7 game and you play different stuff 90% of the time, it's easier not to care. But when GW2 is your favorite game, your inability to continue on while having no fun means a lot more to me than the guy who just logs in to unlock story chapters every 3 1/2 months.
---
&gt;o, the best way to communicate with ANet is to buy more/less on the gemstore or engage more/less in new content. ANet isn't a person, they don't care about what people are saying here on Reddit. They care exclusively about what NCSoft tells them and their share holder's interests. If the Sept 17th prologue episode comes and there's a big jump in engagement and gemstore sales, then it's mission accomplished for ANet, regardless of what we've said to ANet. They'll keep doing what brings in big numbers to appease NCSoft and their shareholders. Unfortunately, WvW, PvP, and Fractal/Raid players leaving is only going to expand the gap between engagement in content and how much players of each gamemode are buying. 
---
man, all they did is add a countdown timer to twitch, it's the playerbase that hyped everything to hell. we knew it was LS time.  they just took advatage of PAX to advertise so to speak.
---
No I wouldn’t exchange it. For me it sounds like should I buy a house to live in or should I buy a Ferrari. That’s not even compareable in my opinion that’s why I thnk it’s odd.
---
anet didnt clarify much about the future in an announcement that was supposed to clarify the future.
---
otherwise, have fun. game's in the best state its ever been currently.
---
So, you're just another out of loop person who barely plays. For people like you, nothing is relevant of the current shitstorm, enjoy the story and avoid the sub, unless you want to get invested.
---
Ahh yes of course "I don't need to prove anything to you, I'm just right and thats it."
---
Good argument.  Here I'll help you out, heres the thread everyone is complaining about, tell me where in here she blamed the community for overhyping? 
---
https://imgur.com/a/250SHmV
---
The power of the bloodstone, not the bloodstone itself.
---
It'll be like chomping of lithium batters when what you want electricity.
---
I was quite hyped, and I honestly think the PoF expansion lived up to the hype, even though the replayability had issues. The Elonian Desert is simply beautiful, and I've never had more fun exploring in a game, except maybe some Elder Scrolls moments. The Elite specs are great, too. And I don't think anyone would ever want to lose their mounts again. 
---
Devs, thank you for PoF. 
---
However, I don't want to compare this to the Icebrood Saga announcement trailer just so that the latter looks "bad". Why even? The studio has changed massively between now and then, and the Icebrood Trailer doesn't reveal much content-wise - isn't meant to - but it is a lovely trailer also.
---
Why would you expect the developers to be transparent when the community goes apeshit over even the smallest amount of information?
---
Look let's cut the bullshit. Nobody believes new elite specs were not introduced because they couldn't find a way to add more hero points LIKE WTF LMAOOO
---
Are you really going to dispute my supposed bullshit with more bullshit that you can't back up? Damn son these are some next level plays.
---
Lets not forget about the other classic tactic companies use after a backlash:  
---
"We understand people are disappointed but our developers received death threats which is unacceptable"   
---
I bet 99% no one threaten them but its just a clever way to make people feel bad about the developers and defuse the situation. Also there are shitty people everywhere. Most of us deal with them at our jobs and our daily lives. It was always like that and it will always will be. I dont get why game developers feel that they will avoid them or get special treatment.
---
What if, just what if, the reason they didn't announce elite specs is because we'll be getting a new profession.
---
It would be incredibly stupid to add the elite specs randomly later just because "it gives people time to get hero points".
---
People seem to have forgotten that the point of this game is exploration, this includes finding and doing the hero points.
---
I don't see how that would be a reason not to talk about especs at all. This is major feature, and I mean MAJOR. It would affect all game modes immediately. There is no explanation for hiding the fact of especs coming, unless they are not coming at all.
---
I think the marketing person was quite brilliant with their self-victimizing tweets. 
---
They're trying to reframe the narrative as *poor company attacked by toxic, entitled misogynists* instead of *company underdelivers* if and when it hits the gaming media.
---
Another peep who plays once per year and comes with an opinion.
---
Yeah, but they can buy those things in the store.
---
People feel that Arenanet overhyped the new content too much by.. renting a theatre? Which apparently made people feel there would be more coming than what was actually delivered. And also that Anet didn't reveal enough stuff and what's coming in the future.
---
They felt that NCsoft advertising merch was a slap in the face.
---
And they feel angry that Anet coworkers on Twitter not liking to get sent threats are supposedly deflecting the issue by calling people toxic.
---
&gt;The comment about pvp and WvW being dictated on what player want, seems like a lie
---
yet they are working on an alliance system that the player base wants.
---
While I disagree with the same point you're disagreeing with, I have to point out that providing the definition of incel does nothing for your argument. Just because these people claim to be involuntarily celibate doesn't preclude them from worshipping women. (Or, more accurately, lusting after the *idea* of women or a particular woman, based on what they think she should be/do.) A lot of incels obsess over particular women. That's part of their massive disgusting creepiness.
---
It is still a lot more active than I would have expected, and I'm really pleased about that, but as far as I understand the couple of devs working on the game are doing so on a voluntary basis in their own time. Given that, I'd guess that a new campaign or expansion a la EotN is basically out of the question. I'd love it if they finally did a Nightfall release to finish the Guild Wars Beyond stuff, but honestly I'm not holding my breath for new playable content in any significant capacity.
---
ELI5 self-quote:
---
&gt;Anet managed to pull off the impossible after massive layoffs and the cancellation of all non-GW-based projects, had kind of a small we-made-it party for themselves and invited a bunch of people for an announcement, but didn't tell anyone that it's just a we-made-it party with an announcement, so everyone thought the guys who never say anything have to have a lot to say if they throw a whole fucking party! So now everyone is let down by the fact that next to nothing has been said, and crazy people seized the moment to shit all over the game from start to finish because it's not the game they want it to be. Yeah no shit, hasn't been that kind of game for seven years, what else is new.
---
&gt;GW2 is going into its fourth iteratation of Living World / Living Story called 'Sagas' and everyone is curious as to what to expect. (Because Anet didn't tell us! Yesimsalty.)
---
Read properly pls. I said they've been like this as a company for 7 years, not that the game has been going downhill since release.
---
Good portion of veterans of the game expected major announcements on the livestreamed event at the theather.
---
Basically the presentation was about LS5 rebreanded as "Saga" and only hints of stuff already announced in development months if not years prior.
---
ANet is being accused of having hyped such event as something answering veterans' major concerns about the game, like WvW, PvP, Raids and Fractals. We got open world Pve announcements that are usually given via blogposts.
---
Shitstorm ensued when ex-Anet employee Matthew Medina and actual employee Ruby Bayer addressed on twitter only those being toxic against devs. People who gave constructive criticism denounce lack of communication and being ignored.
---
We shouldn't need to ask clarifying questions. One of their posts on the official forums actually suggests they deliberately refused to answer questions ("we picked consumer questions aligned with our announcement goals" or something along those lines). That's unacceptable.
---
Really, this is just a lot of excuses how people should have a neutral reaction to ANet doing a terrible job. If people were busy with new content, there would be much less complaining. If ANet answered the super obvious questions that a mildly dumb child could anticipate ("when are we getting new elite specs?"), people would not be speculating. These are paid professionals, not volunteers.
---
I do work for companies with 100-400k employees worldwide. It is highly standardized and you can say "so much". But still customers being handled like people even if they are complete bags of shit.
---
Well, i've been looking at other games for years now and there's just nothing promising there. Even non released ones.
---
Mods, obliterate
---
Which kind of makes me think that this is another case of "We'll wait to tell them". You're right, lately they haven't been that great at hyping things up. I can totally see them misreading the room and thinking this would be fine.
---
I mean, they seemed to think the announcement on Friday was going to be well received and... yeah
---
"my example was deleted, so it means you're wrong".
---
:/ really dude? Where are these death threats that developers keep swearing they get by the truckload? Where's the actual harassment and all the insults and all that? Mods here are decently good, but they're not so fast or incredible at their job to delete all of them so fast if there's as many as they say.
---
The gist of the guild leaving and not returning: This update shouldn't take 2 yrs. Anet obviously could care less about WvW since it barely gets any dev resources.
---
She has her ANET job in her Twitter DESC. She is talking as a dev. Just like Jessica Price. Except Rubi is not calling fans names like a child.
---
Agreed.  I don't think Rubi's tweets were intended to represent the entire community, but have been read that way since we are getting no other communication over the weekend.
---
I made it up?
---
Ahhh troll I see now
---
Well, you see i have another explanation.
---
ANet fucked with stability in march of 2015, which made quite some guilds leave, than came pre HoT specializations update and again a lot of guilds just said, fck it. Than the ultimate knocker HoT. 
---
WvW was a wasteland for a lot of time after that and what is worse even when guilds wanted to play, they would have to wait for half an hour for event to end, because it lagged the whole map.
---
With less guilds and guild players in wvw, quality dropped so much that commanders that were left kinda needed to enforce some rules to be competitive with opposing group to fight. 
---
This is also about the time that people that played for 3 years stopped caring for the score (care for which was dropping even before HoT introduction, since megaservers were added for pve, which stopped influx of people from LA, where there was propaganda to fight for your world). 
---
Well anyway, desert maps and whole story in the year of HoT release dropped population soo much that they had to introduce linking and this is where people really didn't care anymore, it was just whatever, where's my next fight or for other players, where is my ktrain...
---
&gt; Then those of us who are waiting for them can just move on to something else.
---
If you apply some common sense, you'll realize that they are indeed done with those types of content and the silence on the matter is a business decision. They still want your potential money, even if they no longer want to invest their money into catering to your interests.
---
If people like you stick around in this uncertainty, and a fraction of them buys something, they get what they wanted. So tell me, does that mean it is time to move on?
---
I would submit a ticket, as it should've been added by now.
---
You *do* understand that it's possible to have multiple issues of varying levels of importance at the same time, with *all* of them being valid, right?
---
The fact that Issue A is more important or urgent in the short term than Issue B doesn't mean that Issue B is invalid, unimportant, or unworthy of attention. The Sons of Svanir not letting women into their club probably *is* a big deal to a woman who also worships Jormag (and it stands to reason that there are plenty of them, because if worshipping Dragon appeals to a sub-section of male norns, why wouldn't it also appeal to female norns)? Maybe there's an entire group of female norns who also worship Jormag, and they'll be part of the plot.
---
The point is, declaring something "cringe" just because you personally can't handle intelligent discourse within media on issues like gender and sexism -- which are very real and very important issues to a *lot* of people who have to deal with it every day -- is pretty lame, IMO.
---
I think the heart of it all is still good. But making some tweaks to it all to shake it up just enough to be a breath of fresh air.
---
That's cool. Maybe I'll check it out. I heard the end-game gear got screwed up a few updates ago, something about random boxes  ?I'll read up on it haha
---
Just need people that know what's up , same as raids. It helps to have players that actually KNOW, not just Snowcrows zombies.
---
You know, after LS4 I don't really mind no expansion. I'm no hardcore so I still have a lot of stuff from PoF and LS4 to do, heck even from before that. But hat's not the only reason. There is no buildup in LS4, it was the finale itself. Fight with Kralk is over. There is no immediate conflict on the same scale. It needs a build up. LS5 is for that I believe. Whether it will be self contained and with expansion-like features or serves as a buildup for a new expansion, we will see.
---
Exactly, op doesn’t realize a week of casual wvw earns enough heroics to unlock elite specs. 
---
That ain’t it chief,
---
if only they were even slightly similar or had the same strengths...
---
This cracked me up, thanks for bring a smile to my face today!
---
Meh, worst thing that can happen is they say no. Go ahead! GL.
---
?
---
They were one of the most communicative companies at the time. Did you forget Colin's massively detailed roadmaps? Or the frequent streams that pvp developers would do with hosters to talk about the state of the game, balance, future goals, etc.
---
Here's a reminder:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0togRMEc\_o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0togRMEc_o)
---
I mean , yeas and no. For example , raids are not a huge player draw , % wise. But having them enriches the game, which is a benefit . It's similar to having to satisfy free-loader players , to keep people around so that your whales have people to play with.
---
I simply hate this kind of argument, The exactly same shit pro-gov/China dudes use to against we the youth in HONG KONG, if you don't like HK gov, just leave HK.
---
But somehow you still managed to write a whole essay out of this lame as hell argument.
---
I dont know . My friend bought it for me but i think its not retailer
---
If they don't intend to add new elite specs there are still a lot of things Anet could do to keep things relatively interesting that shouldn't cause them that much work or balance issues.
---
They could add new weapon sets per base class (3 - 5 new skills per class)
---
New offhand weapons (2 skills per class)
---
They could add new utility sets (usually 4 per class set) though im not sure how they would handle revenant doing this
---
New Runes and sigils
---
New Gear Sets
---
If they don't plan more elite specs then i hope this would be something they would consider
---
In 2019 if people can't read and translate few basic eng words they should learn eng instead of playing a MMO. (from italian player)
---
If i bought it from another site not officials ones. Will they ban me ?
---
Yep. GW1 alongside FFXI’s will be my top 2 MMOs for all time. So much fun. So many few experiences in the genre. 
---
Trying Classic WoW right now. It’s pretty good. Strong community. Feels like an actually MMO. I’ve missed this.
---
and also never provide examples of this so-called "toxic" feedback.
---
Hmmm. I would nitpick here and there, but in general I think there's enough truth in there. Maybe we're both right. The dismissive toxicity towards casual PvE queen rallybots started to spike definitely pre-HoT, but I see no reason why WvW wouldn't have to take several hits from multiple fronts, leading to its collapse. Losing Anet, for example, I can imagine was a pretty big deal. I know my server, a pretty big one, didn't have to do that anymore after a certain point, and COULDN'T (and wouldn't have wanted to anyway) do it anymore afterwards, doubling down on strangling the blood supply.
---
Add to that veterans not giving a shit about anything but fights anymore and the odd casual stumbling into the game mode not getting presented with anything interesting (huge fucking sieges are quite the spectacle for them, less so for people who've done them a billion times), and everything goes down the shitter.
---
&gt;addressing the negative feedbacks takes a lot of time because you don't want to take the risk of miscommunication, do people really expect a well thought out feedback over a disappointing announcement over the weekend?
---
I do expect one of the three following:
---
a. Don't make disappointing presentations in the first place. This is vastly more realistic than it sounds, we just tend to hold people to really low bars.
---
b. Time presentations more intentionally. They were not forced into that time slot by government regulation nor emergency, so they bare all praise or blame related to the timing of it. As a very tech related example, one does not simply push a live update at 4:59 pm on a Friday and then leave.
---
c. Yes, fix it. I do weekend work when needed, and while I do think we need to be careful about work/life balance, if something gets fucked up, asking people to come in and then giving them some comp time to balance out isn't unreasonable.
---
&gt;A game as a service will never tell  you straight "yeah we can't tell you when the thing you like will come  back" because there whole strategy is retention... the comparison to a  bbq joint is ludicrous  
---
&gt;you don't have to like it, I'm not arguing that the model is fair for the consumer
---
Your last point is precisely why no one should ever give them the least bit of defense. Consumer backlash is precisely the balancing part that helps incentives to be unethical be less extreme.
---
This whole thing is ANet and some fans trying to build a culture of lack of accountability. They designed the announcement, they timed the announcement, and they choose not to respond to the feedback quickly. They have earned the reaction they are getting.
---
Same here ... except the newer account didn't get it yet
---
Those are you thoughts, but you are not seeing point. You are not looking into facts or truth.
---
Fact is they are not treating all customers equally. Users who only own PoF before promotion will receive HoT for free, while those who only own HoT receive just skin. If you don't see that is wrong there you are getting robed in shop regularly.
---
Please take a look on bigger picture and look into that screenshot. Also you can check 20s of stream video from 1:11:20. I posted it bellow as comment.
---
You cannot say i stopped supporting game when you do not know that, that is just your speculation. But on side note i supported game much more over 6years then those who buy it today will ever do (unless they spend ridiculous money on it for gambling).
---
What I'm saying is they should fix what they are saying or simply give everyone same treatment.
---
My main facts are that screenshot, video from promotion, and my own experience.
---
If anyone is looking for a clear example of someone that isn't willing to let go; look no further than this comment.  
---
The game is doing amazingly well right now for a reason, that's why I said to make the decision for yourself on a trial, not just take my word (or this fanboy's) word for it. Be your own person and make an informed decision.
---
Lotsof hours played!  What do you enjoy most about the game? Wardrobe/skin Collections?
---
You know the future of gw2 looks dark, when even WP feels disappointment
---
Yakitty yak, don't talk back.
---
You moved, failure to complete the goal.
---
Go and try it again, this time actually understand what you're trying to accomplish.
---
i played ff14 myself since last year lad...great game but way too few meaningful things to do and the patches are very thin (if you arent a hardcore raider). similar to gw2 mind you, which is why they complement each other well.
---
They decided to make the living world announcement in a theater because it was the anniversary and PAX was happening, people got overhyped because how they lead to it with a timer, then after a few story announcements and mentions of some PvP and WvW content, they spent the rest of the time time shilling merchandise, and players who didn't like any of the things announced started complaining about all the things they wanted and are never getting to vent their frustration.
---
I'm glad that GW2 is still active, GW1 was dead 4 years after release.
---
Weird flex
---
I'm waiting on 2 out of 3 accounts.
---
Anything they say will be taken as a promise, no matter how many caveats they throw in front of the news if it turns out different to what they say, the fanbase will be even angrier than they are now.
---
Players in Queensdale have full ascended and synergistic traits? Try again with greens.
---
Also, you chose to waste your time, I didn't force anything.
---
Might wanna be careful about vote brigading as well.
---
Again, what is your character name? And what world did you play on?
---
I'm not a lad, either.
---
&gt; Their announcement could have been a great success if there was something like " this sage will also contain a new elite spec"
---
That really only works when something their players want is actually planned.
---
Anything not announced a few days ago simply isn't coming. They got the rug pulled out from under them a while ago (a failure of their management, but still).  They took stock of what they can do and what needs to be cut, and worked towards this announcement weekend. What we were told now is what they believe they can deliver.
---
Obviously they know we wanted more. So they weighted their options and decided that while radio silence on important topics will cause a reddit outrage, it will ultimately drive away fewer players than a full disclosure of all the things that are not going to happen.
---
Do I like how this went down? No. But that's how it is. The only thing left is to decide for yourself whether you are one of those staying despite this bleak outlook, or not.
---
You're linking to 18 months old comment. It was already said when mixed links were introduced that alliances will not provide language-specific links and matchups due to e.g. coverage and population number differences.
---
Ultimate damage control, keep digging your grave anet.
---
Well said. Anet needs to start acknowleging the reasonable members of the GW2 community
---
Well, tell me more. I would actually enjoy such a boss. Maybe with phases underwater and on land or even without mechanics just for the reaction of mapchat when the fight takes place underwater :D
---
&gt; This is what happened with Fractals before the current RNG system was implemented.
---
Well you answered your own question here, and the solution has been suggested many times: daily raid bosses with extra rewards. 
---
Kill Sabetha today and get extra gold, stabilizing matrices, magnetite shards and a chance for some uncommon and rare drops.
---
Exactly this. I just cant get hooked on it for some reason. And now the Elder Scrolls Online has been my MMO. There's nothing that scratches the GW1 itch though unfortunately. This makes me somewhat sad now that I think about it to be honest.
---
I lost interest when Scourge, Firebrand &amp; Mirage debuted w/ PoF.  I played a ton of sPVP in vanilla &amp; HoT.  I don't think sPVP in GW2 will ever move beyond Conquest because Stronghold was such a colossal failure.  ArenaNet forced a moba-map that no one really wanted and then neglected to make any meaningful changes to it; furthermore putting it in the ranked rotation was a disaster.   It's a dead map.
---
I've actually played about ~ 3,000 games which is still in the 95th percentile on GW2Efficiency.  I played a lot of Chrono, Berserker &amp; Reaper and had a lot of fun vanilla GW2 before HoT as well -- one of my goals was to grind to r80 for the phoenix and dragon finishers.  Later on I crafted the Ascension within about 2-3 seasons if I remember right? That was fun too.
---
sPVP won't get a new game-mode without at least 3-4 maps to mirror the original conquest queue.  I don't think the game can support such a massive split in population when it's already struggling.  I hear stories all the time of match-making being all over the place.  RIP.
---
I agree, particularly as it's something I would've expected ArenaNet to consider given having a transcript helps less-abled fans understand the announcement.
---
Of course, like most people in the community who do things for the game, they won't see any sort of reward from ArenaNet.
---
Can confirm this on raids as well. Me and my group just got into raiding back in may and have completed almost 6/7 wings barring cms. Cant tell you how many "vetrans" shit down our throats at the first mistake or run twitch streams and make fun of us for fucking up for their 30 people watching. Hell we even see them telling people not to touch raids until you have 2 full sets of ascended and trinkets. The ironic part is we find folks in all exotics that can beat them in dps and complete mechs faster and cleaner than some of the folks bitching.
---
The truth is that if it wasn't for fresh blood coming into raids and trying to learn the mechs, then they would 100% never get another god damn raid wing in their life. Hell half the reason wvw and raids are avoided is because of the players alone. I dont blame anet for cutting support between the metrics of the players and the reviews. If you ran a business would you support a game mode in your game that was 1% of pop participation and had abound toxicity and elitism? I say maybe good riddance to some of this toxic veteran mentality. 
---
Were no where near pro and we learned to raid. Honestly it may behoove the game to lose some older members and let new mighty tea pots, wooden potatoes, elite running guilds, world v worlders to come into the fray. People may not like it but a changing of the guard is sometimes necessary to avoid this gate keeping bullshit. 
---
As a final note for those who downvote this, if you wana help and show anet your voice do it by being constructive. If your fucking bored of the content get off your asses and recruit. Teach new minds the way it works and let them experience the great game you all have come to deep down care about. You dont know something fully until you can teach it and even then it can be improved. Let others experience the gratification you did playing gw2.
---
Basically, yeah.
---
And to be very clear: it sucks. I don't want to be holed up in some kind of wizard's tower, I don't want to have that distance. But all in all, it's probably for the best (at least for me, which, y'know, kinda matters to me).
---
It is fake, it should be upside down if it from Australia
---
Generally almost everything living story related is open world content which is in turn made mostly for the casual audience (Which isn't a bad thing) but they can't just focus on one player base, I even consider the skyscale collection extremely easy and casual content, but it is however heavily timegated and drawn out which in turn obviously pissed off a lot of casual players due to the fact that they can't spend that much time just farming a mount that is "ok". 
---
The problem isn't necessarily that loads of content is made for casuals (Open world PvE content) I love that content too. The problem is that everything else is completely neglected, people who cry for raids and fractals need to get over themselves though tbh, I raid and do daily CM's etc and there is plenty of that for now and the raiding scene has grown quite a bit compared to after HoT, that took forever to build up I remember farming the first wing for months until it was so overdone that I quit the game due to no new raids, now we have 7 wings. 
---
But when they make blog posts about how they have grand updates and new awesome mechanics and changes coming for WvW and PvP for example and nothing gets released, and years later they just say well it's coming soon! When is this soon? Cause soon there won't be any players left... I'm not a mega amazing sPvP player but even I could make it into top 200 with no effort, cause there are no players left. 
---
At this point I just log in for the daily chest and log off, I want to play so bad but I just know I'll be bored in 10 minutes and will log off again, and even during peak times WvW I don't see commander tags anymore on Desolation which has been a top server since pretty much the beginning of GW2. 
---
So I guess my point is just that I can't defend Anet or Gw2 anymore when someone talks shit about the game cause honestly, even I feel let down and disappointed. But I'll always keep my hopes up I suppose that one day NCsoft goes to shit and Anet survives and do their own thing and make some huge saving the game update or something cause I love this game.
---
thats the glamour big brain, since i prefer the garlean look. now stop.
---
Or you know, you could just stop lying.
---
There could be new uses for hero points.
---
For example, we could be able to unlock stats and upgrades for the account, and then each character would have to 'learn' them individually with hero points, and switch between them with templates in our current gear if we don't have legendary gear by spending a curency like spirit shards and materials like lucent motes. 
---
The core hero points would be enough to learn the upgrades and stats available in core, then HoT already has plenty left after they reduced the cost to train the spec to half, PoF could get a few new points, and living world maps that offer new stats and upgrades could get these blue points, giving 5 points instead 1 or 10.
---
gw2 isnt dying either, and doesnt have a complaining playerbase? was blu a fever dream? are there male vierras and i missed it?
---
This is Exactly why I'm so confused at all the salt around here. Where did they Ever say Explicitly that it was going to be anything more than info about LW5??
---
"See you later fuckers". Goddess Kormir.
---
Where are the posts complaining about lack of content, the game dying, the devs not caring, or any of the other things r/Guildwars2 is running rampant with?
---
The game being in trouble has nothing to do with certain game modes being neglected...  It has to do with the rate at which anet manages to accomplish anything—for any game mode.
---
They’ve went an entire quarter without any new playable content for *any* game mode (with the exception of dragon bash) and what makes it even worse is that they say nothing about it.  Almost every other major MMO (and even non major ones) have some sort of *weekly* community wrap up that touches base with players, lets them know what the company’s up to and/or shines some sort of community spotlight on what other players are doing.  This is basically free content, since it’s showing people what other players in the game are doing and might give them ideas of things to do.  It’s crazy that anet doesn’t hire an intern to do this for them.  
---
The worst part is that the little communication we do get makes everything feel worse.  Like they wait 6 months to say something, then unveil a list of a bunch of cool features that we still haven’t gotten by the time they make their next announcement 6 months later and say all those things are still being worked on. 
---
If their business model is just to try and hook new players, who will have lots to do, while neglecting the endgame for anyone who bothers to stick around, I guess that’s fine—but at least be upfront about it.
---
That cute little river in Queensdale just outside of DR.
---
Just leave 4Head
---
Ypu know if everyone who has complained leave, there will be nobody left, right?
---
For now, i use gw2 as walking simulator :p and am quiet enjoying it!!! but that is sad in itself
---
its a well known thing that ff14 devs dont listen to any community other than the one in japan. and i havent been around for it, but ive heard heavensward was a pretty bad time for content releases.
---
It really hasn't. There have been times the sub dipped into negativity (usually during content droughts or when brigaded controversies pop up, which is sort of how this began) but generally this sub was pretty positive and constructive. People have always criticised the game but in the past it usuaully had a purpose, it skewed heavily on the side of constructive and in good faith, but just recently it's been a chaotic mess of people complaining about communication, demanding communication, people scapegoating players of different content in the game, people misrepresenting ArenaNet's announcement or content that has been added to the game in the last six months and a whole lot of abuse and condescension targeted at the developers.
---
It's not new, but it's never been this widespread or dominant. People are being chased away and don't want to post or participate anymore because it has become such a miserable place to be, which is just making the problem worse.
---
And I hear 2019 is a bad time for Gw2 players...
---
Yeah but here’s the thing: quitting the game does not in **any** way preclude you from still talking about it here on this subreddit, or on Twitter, in your guild/server’s discord, or wherever. I’d suspect that a lot of the people airing their grievances here on this subreddit and elsewhere are doing so *precisely because* they aren’t doing it in game. 
---
I’d rather have a place like here for people to spend their time complaining—regardless of how valid you or I may think their complaints are—so that I don’t have to deal with it in game, so I can have my fun in game and these people have a place to vent.
---
Now there are certain people here who spend just an inordinate amount of time seemingly dedicating their life purpose to concern trolling and also shitting on the game and even its players. I suppose we could do without those people spewing constant poison here, because it’s not really doing anything good for anyone. If anything, it just gives so-called “white knights” and “shills” ammo to deflect actual valid criticism by associating **any** negative feedback with the kind of vitriol these people inject into the conversation.
---
I was like wow, that's a lot of gems.
---
Then I checked my account, and thought, oh it's not actually - and I know I have "bought" very few gems with real money.
---
Which is incredible.  Because first of all, it's going to work.  And second, it's delegitimizing *actual problems*.  Which is a real long-term issue that people doing this don't seem to care about.
---
&gt;This isn't the players fault for reacting the way they did, the fault squarely lies on Anets shoulders for over-hyping something that should have been in a blog post.  If they gave us this information in a blog post, both the reddit and official forms wouldn't be flooded with all these negative threads.  Sure there would be threads here and there from the competitive community, but nothing like we see now.  How they marketed this was piss-poor, a solid 1-2 out of 10.
---
I want to expand upon this. "Hype" is not accidental. Marketing efforts deliberately try to engineer feelings in target populations, drawing on decades of research and experience, as well as consultations with PhDs in relevant fields (marketing, psychology, neurobehavioral, etc).
---
People are moral actors and need to take responsibility for their actions, but companies need to take responsibility for the predictable results of their deliberate, engineered marketing campaigns. You don't get to dose someone with a love potion and then complain they are too clingy.
---
&gt;Because its literally their job to do so.
---
Not over the weekend/holiday. We're unlikely to get much officially until after the long weekend, if they choose to do any direct response, which I doubt.
---
You can be descriptive without making your entire post, the title of the post. I think that's simple enough to understand.
---
Whenever I’m playing, it’s really not populated.
---
It's been 7 years. Most of the time when we got silence, the truth behind it was bad news.
---
They don't deserve the benefit of the doubt. This last month was the last straw for me, and many other players.
---
Initially it didn't work for me, but changing the path to C:\\\\Guild Wars 2 in config.ini fixed it.
---
lady, [get a life](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/ckbu20/have_you_thought_about_making_the_switch_to_ffxiv/). or go back to erp-ing and petting lalas.
---
So why was Kralk called a grandfather then? Modern terminology sure. I can believe that but why did they go out of their way to include a very masculine word for him and feminine for Aurene? Did Aurene choose her gender? Did Kralk? I see what you're saying but there's a massive hole in the logic. I'm hoping some of this can be answered in the story because if an elder dragon is a force beyond fearing death then why does it have feelings about it's gender so much so that it will choose one or another identity or a non-binary identity? Something's just not adding up for me and maybe we haven't been given enough information.
---
there was absolutely nothing wrong with the next destination. i personally dont care that we're not getting an xpac because we have been told that we will get xpac sized additions to the game with the chapters and now sagas
---
the main problem is the over hype. we expected to hear about the xpac sized additions to the game, but heard very little
---
Definitely. The open beta was what sold PoF. The raptor mount's amazing movements and animations, the elite specialisations, the Crystal Oasis map being huge and packed with things to do between forged, branded and other enemies all hyped the game much more than any trailer could. It was enough for me and all my irl friends who had abandoned GW2 to come back and buy both expansions.
---
It was the regular reminders, using wording like "special announcement event" in their news post, cool timer on Twitch and the fact that they hired a theatre and hosted a live event for it that led people to assume there was going to be something more.
---
They put a lot of effort into something that usually only gets a blog post and a Twitch guild chat.
---
Yes I would, you don't know me.  There is a huge difference between the wvw alliances update which was announced years ago, and simply telling the players that they intend to make more raids when the last raid was released 2 months ago.  Are you really unable to see the difference there?
---
Yeah, that's dumb. Frankly I think downvotes were a mistake in the first place. While it can feel good to downvote someone who is being an asshole, overall I think downvotes continually strengthen subreddit echochambers through negative reinforcement.
---
&gt;I’d be unsalted if you hadn’t.
---
LOL I did your fucking dopey challenge and I knew you'd try to come back and add more conditions on. I'm sorry, you look like a moron now. Have the courage to accept you were wrong and move on.
---
I still don't follow you. Where did I say that caterpillars are worms?
---
Interesting response in the new twitter thread.
---
    I don't claim to know how the ArenaNet devs roll, but I know there's approximately a lot of reasons a developer might A) Read players' feedback and then B) Not implement it, or even respond to it. Ratio of players to devs, for example.
---
This is the most active person who is calling the community toxic, and they *don't actually know the situation* and are generalizing based on the tweets.
---
So irregardless of truth the method's working working.
---
only thing left is the legendary feast :)
---
Oh! You’re actually not wrong... been such a long time, forgot when they were added! Turns out, they were added with nightfall, roughly October 2006 (gw1 released in 2005). Still, a year since it came out, and they still had premade templates before for pvp characters.
---
Thing to note: GW1 was pumping out campaigns (not expansions) roughly every 6 months. Nightfall was the third campaign (so, you can assume like the second expac).
---
This is still something they had early on, compared to the 7 years we have had now with GW2.
---
And the supposed mobile game is the butterfly!
---
Yeah, exactly. This merch isn't subtle, nor is it something that people will instantly grasp if they don't play the game. Personally I like subtle, nicely-designed merch (something that's fine to wear when out which is just a little wink to other players), but get that some others like the opposite (to *really* make clear what game it relates to). This appeals to neither audience.
---
They see everyone who criticises them as someone who is hateful and bashing them for the fun of it.
---
Wow she is incredibly stupid, this is embarrassing
---
Maybe ... because many of them have different meshes between the glider and back item version so the textures are probably different as well. Which means the amount of work doesn't change for those.
---
Why does it matter what Jormag's VA is or how the elder dragon identifies?
---
"Are you a man or a woman?" - "I am Ice."
---
"Yeah yeah, but what gender are you?" - "Frozen."
---
"But what's in your pants?" - "Doom."
---
It's like asking what gender a blizzard is as you freeze to death.
---
pff, not even top 100
---
well, nevermind me, id make sure your kid doesnt find your reddit account.
---
I’d deflect the conversation too if I were you. Yes, I post nudes, we all know, what a shock this is.
---
We don't, but there wouldn't be one anyway after LS4. Anet said it multiple times, after LS4 comes LS5.
---
Yeah I agree with the PvE side of things. More content is fine but I really want something that has a big impact on how you play content. Gliding, mounts, elite specs - these have a big impact on your regular gameplay and make even old content feel fresh.
---
I assume tp baron but could also be whale. Still get to top 10 or it's not good enough for a good Flex.^^
---
How else are you supposed to get electricity? They're not suppositories smh
---
wow
---
okay
---
you said "now they are both worms"
---
in the picture they are not both worms
---
hope that clears it up
---
how did you put the infusion in green gear?
---
I dunno, the toxicness comes in waves. It will be fine Ina. Week or so, but what about the next drought? I think more needs to be done around here. Unsure what though.
---
they arent going to give anything more than a vague couple of statements, lets be real.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dolyak_Tincture
---
I think it is misleading to say Anet is doing anything they don't explicitly tell us.  Maybe they will make another raid, but if they won't say, then I assume they won't say for a reason.
---
I appreciate the effort but this list is pretty vague.
---
"New rewards"  "new features "
---
I think it would help coming up with more concrete ideas.
---
Also I dont think a new map would solve the WvW problem.
---
Wait, why is monday a day off?
---
I don't know why you were downvoted for this, lol. It's not like you said anything hateful about trans people. One of my best friends is a transwoman and even though the pitch of her voice has gone up since publicly transitioning (whether that's from HRT or vocal training or both idk) she still definitely has a lower voice than the average ciswoman.
---
mmoga is not an approved seller by the Lionguard and can lead to trouble if bought from. Just stick with the approved merchants so I don't have to come bail you out, recruit.

Did not know if you knew, but you can salvage the “trash” ascended feasts for the ascended vials to make more compost.
---
They're definitely trying to shift blame. It's something Sean Murray of No Man's Sky has done as well. While many are now happy with the game many years later after the updates, he never actually owned up to his mistakes but of course was all about finger pointing at how toxic the internet had been.
---
Labor Day in America. Its like May 1st in the UK.
---
Labor day in the US.
---
Trump gives more relevant info over tweeter :).
---
That money isn't yours after you spend it. Anet has no obligation to spend that money in any particular way, and the expectation that they not spend profits from gw2 on other projects is absurd (how the fuck would any company grow if it did that?). If it stings, it's your fault for not understanding how a business works.
---
&gt; I respectfully disagree. Honesty and transparency are exactly what the players want; there have been many posts conveying this. Why would people go “apeshit” if they got what they want?
---
Imagine a perfect world where the devs straight up say "we don't want to update raids because not enough people are into them" and everyone responds "oh, that's fair." 
---
Sounds like fking science fiction right? Realistically speaking, all the raiders would babyrage for months and quit the game.
---
You think you want honesty, but you don't.
---
&gt; To add variety and content to the game...?
---
Yes, make the system even more complicated and shovel labor costs and resources into unbalancing the old elite specs and/or releasing new mediocre specs. What a good idea, you should be president of Anet.
---
&gt; It’s not their job to take the easy way out in hopes of avoiding criticism
---
You're right. It's their job to make games, not feed a reddit black hole of entitled crybabies.
---
I know. It's still a very long wait for an expansion.
---
It's perfect!
---
There's plenty of content coming in Icebrood Saga aimed at casual pve players. A new evolving map, new meta event, strike bosses, plenty of lore and story (and definitely achievements to hunt)... WvW got the same announcement they've had for over a year, PvP got *actually mocked* ("yeah, woo! The guy in the back, the one PvP fan!") and a cosmetic item set, fractals got nothing, and raids were only mentioned to hype up this new thing that isn't raids. In fact, the strike announcement only mentioned raids to disparage them as "hard to get into" or "take too much time" or the real kick: "it's hard to even get a group of friends together for a raid".
---
All of those raid complaints come down to raids requiring team composition. So the only way these strikes won't have the *exact same issues* would be these strikes being balanced around a bunch of random players with no dedicated support roles. Meaning that a raid squad that *does* have DPS players in full DPS gear, access to Quickness/Alacrity/Fury/Might, and a source or two of healing will absolutely destroy the strike bosses.
---
If the strikes *are* balanced around boons and support and DPS players that use the right stats and stack, they'll be just as "hard to form up for" as raids.
---
Doesn't make the wait for the expansion tier features people are excited for any shorter.
---
No matter the game, raiding is niche content. No matter the game only a small percentage raid at all. Raiders are locusts that consume faster than can be created, and then bitch about not getting enough or good enough. Raids do not enrich. Raiding poisoned this game.
---
Whales keep your raids around at all. No matter how much you might hate the idea of it, Whales are the only thing keeping the MMO genre afloat.
---
wish had invested more into that game when it was around. only got to level 27, never experienced any of the dungeons or raids :(
---
so does a push up bra, both known as lies
---
Garden plots haven't been around for ages though, the PSA is very much appreciated!
---
Means aerial
---
They rented a theatre and out of the promised 45 minutes we only got 36 minutes. Out of those 36 minutes 6 minutes were HoT is free and merchandise.
---
Of course they promoted the announcement. The fact they don't have to show much doesn't change their need of showing that little to as many people as possible. Thats' called marketing. If you dislike what they have to offer then you should be smart enough to no longer support their product instead of complaining about something that can not be changed. If they could show us more they would do that. The studio sadly seems to be in a very fucked state and complaining on reddit won't fix that.
---
Since they have those blue HP icons now, maybe they’ll add HPs in the new maps. After the saga is done with enough HPs in the new maps, they might release new specs. Honestly I don’t even like the idea of elite specs i wish they would just add new utility or weapon skills sporadically like how they did with thief preparations (but not replace any existing skill)
---
We already have a weapon swap button.
---
too bad everything up to around the first Titan fight is a pure slog and is boring as fuck.  stuff only starts to pick up til a few levels before you reach the old level cap and that's A LOT of sub par game to expect people to suffer through.  and this is coming from someone who thinks FF14 is amazing.
---
I still hop on there and run some dungeons and what not with a couple friends. The heroes in that game make it still completely playable today.
---
&gt; But they did eventually fix that, and the universe is so big that those occurrences were incredibly rare to begin with.
---
Two people went to the same place within, like, a day or two of launch IIRC.
---
I don't think anybody's real problem was the lack of the feature. The problem was Sean *repeatedly* lying about it.
---
https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/startrek-picard-facepalm-768x374.jpg
---
I agree with you. Luckily the ARR slog is being reworked as of patch 5.3!
---
um not at all, its like you painted entirely different charr over it
---
the shame is FF14 combat is actually kind of fast paced but you have to level up quite a bit before you unlock enough off-gcd attacks to weave into your rotation and until then you're basically just having to deal with a 2.5 second gcd
---
I feel like this gets posted every few weeks...
---
I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye.
---
Imo they should not talk about the drama at all because the drama is nothing but just that, drama blown out of proportion and all those that took it too far are not worthy a answer. 
---
That is not how life works. If you cause havok then you should not be rewarded for that by getting attention.
---
Should they talk about the game and what to come and give us more info and a future to hope for. Yes this they should talk because this is fair to ask for and many have which indicate that it is important for the players to get a answer to and to get us out of the position we are in now.
---
So i hope we get some more info, more comunication, and not so much wait until release surprise, but more talk about the game and if there is a future for the game and what we can expect. 
---
Real talk, roadmap talk and something that also continues. A dev letter maybe every third month or so telling us what we can see in the future, ballance, elitespecs, and so on. Give us a future to hope for!
---
Yeah just comparable what they did during the announcement of PoF but keep on shilling /shrug
---
just for the record: they already are in full damage control mode.
---
6 months ago i got over 500 down votes for saying almost this exact sentence. Community is finally waking up, anet is fucked now.
---
Thanks, Ive been disconnected from this.
---
Stronghold failed because Anet never addressed feedback. They just read it and moved on instead of dealing with it. And splitting the community argument is what they have been saying since launch. Using that argument just mirrors what I said. PvP wants new modes, but Anet doesn’t want to do it based off an archaic notion. 
---
Gratz in the PvP success though. I withdrawal that part. I have a similar past on that realm.
---
You know, if they actually do what you're talking about, I think they might have a chance to make this work.
---
For instance, if we get into the new map and there's a really obvious ice-wall over a cave entrance, we'll make a mental note of it. Then one day, the ice recedes. No fanfare necessary. People notice slowly, then all at once. People flood in to explore the new area and there's another walkway that's closed off by a big avalanche.
---
Then one day, the storm gets really bad and wind sweeps through, clearing away the new path and opening up the last part of the map.
---
Like goddamn, that sounds like a *living world* to me.
---
And like you said, if they use this to fill in waiting times between updates, that would actually be really effective.
---
Wow I'm sure glad they still have *nothing to show* for it.
---
Knowing english in games is just too important, not knowing it in 2019 can not be used as an excuse for anything.Even the older generation who got into games and such in their older ages, they learned english almost in full passive mode, meaning that they didnt even wanted to learn it but in the end they did.There are two things about this, one being, you understand and speak english but you will still keep acting as if you dont know and there are the people who barely can speak english but they still speak it so everyone who wants to understand them can do so. Using not knowing english as an excuse for toxicity and such isnt acceptable. I think everyone who played this or other games can understand basic commands given by commander.
---
for emphasis: i've been subscribed to their newsletter pretty much since launch or whenever it existed. actually go one about ever 3-4 LW releases since then. somehow though this event was worth *two* distinct mails.
---
and that's just their newsletter.
---
i actually agree with this all of the competent players should leave and go to ff14. Its their game now
---
&gt;Whales are the only thing keeping the MMO genre afloat.
---
A truth I feel that many are aware of, but don't truly appreciate. Particularly in GW2's case with no sub fee.
---
League ([Eternals](https://www.dexerto.com/league-of-legends/league-of-legends-devs-backlash-premium-stat-tracking-eternals-909189)): Essentially Riot released a premium stat tracking system that cost paid currency to buy. People got reallllllly upset.

---
Who's talking about blame now. *rolls eyes*
---
&gt; Cite all the anecdotes you want   
---
&gt; but it doesn't change the facts of the situation 
---
when someone else's points are immediately "anecdotal evidence", but "x demographic was never big enough" is a "fact" because you said so
---
ok
---
&gt; If these modes represented the majority of the company's revenue stream 
---
I never said they were the majority revenue stream. I said they most certainly have been populous enough to be relevant. You're moving the goalposts. The modes are dwindling precisely because of Anet's inaction and mismanagement. When you're passionate about WvW or raids and you keep giving feedback which falls on deaf ears, then of course people get frustrated or bored and peace out. There's a reason why this subreddit has been majorly up in arms recently, and it's precisely because these game modes are very much relevant.
---
I can kind of understand why you'd think that WvW/PvP are 'irrelevant', despite the fact that they're still game modes loved by many players and propped up by them. They've been slowly bleeding out for literally years because of Anet's decisions (or indecision, at times). What I'm really curious about is how on earth you managed to come to this strange idea that *raids* are too 'irrelevant' for GW2.
---
Bingo.
---
Come on, that was kind of funny.
---
Dragonfall, northern route. Just pretty much everything there.
---
It happened with JPrice (regardless your opinion on her tweets), and it happened again now. Maybe with less gamergaters this time.
---
Honestly, at this point this subreddit is just a big circlejerk
---
Why do you hurt me?
---
Possibly related to new raven spirit mastery. It might have skills that we unlock with those special hero points.
---
Thanks and yeah I fully agree although sadly this problems extends to other game developers as well with the number increasing :(
---
g2a is not an approved seller by the Lionguard and can lead to trouble if bought from. Just stick with the approved merchants so I don't have to come bail you out, recruit.
---
I believe the mods are doing great in this situation: there were indeed two problems one with temporally closing the ruby thread and the other with sorting by new the main (thread)[https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cy6mjb/game_developers_in_2019_lets_only_publicly/] but other than that anything that's been low quality, "WTF IS THIS SHIT", low value posts have been obliterated.
---
&gt; shes not the one whose making decisions be reasonable too
---
No, she's not making the decisions; however, she chose to post that *directly after* the flop of the announcement and now seems to be backpedaling pretty hard and pointing at some other drama being the reason she posted it.
---
Its not like the community hasn't been asking ANet to hype stuff more and do more marketing… for like..years?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cybkxj/rubi_about_toxicity_and_feedback_part_2_the_saga/
---
It was a thread going up, then boom locked.
---
It's not about not reading it. It's about not replying to it, lest what happens is that you **validate** toxic behavior.
---
Because:
---
* All the level-headed criticism got 0 reaction out of ANet.
---
* 1 toxic asshole threatens the devs and immediately gets reactions.
---
So, if you wanted to get ANet's attention, what do you think would work, given the prior evidence?
---
Honestly I'm sure some people do send death threats, but when no examples are given all everyone has to go on is a developers word and in 2019 for most developers that doesn't mean much unfortunately.
---
I mean this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cybkxj/rubi_about_toxicity_and_feedback_part_2_the_saga/
---
And there was another one yesterday that went the same direction but then it was unlocked by another mod.
---
Glowing eye masks are just color variants for each other, and yet they are still sold separately.
---
Lol great analogy I enjoyed reading that 👍🏻
---
I used to be anal about giving feedback. Yeah, people can get emotional and out of hand with their expression.
---
Yeah people need to remember that ANet got hit with massive fucking layoffs just months ago. For all we know, ANet WANTS to bring back that kind of content, they just don't have anything of substance to tell us right now.
---
But nah. Let's act like whiny, entitled children.
---
&gt; Aren't the devs still coping with massive layoffs from earlier this year?
---
On this point from what was stated at the time the lost jobs were mainly from other projects and the GW2 team was only marginally reduced overall. This was used as an excuse by fanboys and possibly Anet as to why future content wouldn't be overly affected. Now we're being told it did affect future content. So which is it?
---
Thanks for the heads up, I haven't kept up with most games these days.
---
Seen your responses over the last days in this subreddit? Nicest community straight at work.
---
Ah sorry. You said new offhand weapons as its own thing so I thought you meant new to the game
---
&gt;aren't we probably just wasting oxygen?
---
Not really, no
---
Thanks for the help!
---
&gt; They announced they would show us the next chapter of living world and they did exactly that. Nothing to be fed up about here really.
---
Since last year ArenaNet focused their marketing about how Living World is equal or even better than expansion. They made interviews, after lay offs they confirmed the game is moving forward, with expansion like content and features to be expected. Then they advertised this announcement with big ass 40 hour timer.
---
At the end, Anet did an expanded version of their regular guild chat and played a trailer. No gameplay shown, even though the saga begins in 2 weeks. This is beyond pathetic.
---
Do you seriously believe it's all on community? Are you in peace with yourself to claim such things, while facts are against them?
---
Normally I would agree with you that people hype themselve too much. But not this time. This is not self created entitlement. For 12 months Anet was saying, that season 5 will be more than what we saw previously with Living World.
---
The only thing it can unlock is a ban. 
---
Dlgamer has cheap codes as well and it's official seller.
---
Yeah I meant the one from Rubi. Wanted to avoid naming her so the post wasn't reported for witch hunting or anything.
---
You should be thanking them, it took them long enough.
---
Now that's a name I haven't heard in a while.
---
Why tho?
---
I know you're joking but the funny part is GW1 was never actually dying, when they shipped off the work on GW2 the original GW was the most popular it had ever been. The game consistently grew with launch and reached peak players after Nightfall. 
---
For better or worse (I know the current sentiment) Anet is a company that's always trying to do something new. The closest approximation to GW1 that GW2 players have is knowing they started working on something else when the game was ostensibly going so well.
---
Mod did the same with original thread. The thread is locked, but not removed. Probably for the better.
---
I don't understand the need for easy mode raid. It's not like the current wings are hard? Also they have been out for years, just read or watch a guide..
---
Yikes... If "ded gaem" and "nO ConTenT" is regarded as toxic then that explains a lot. I was wondering where all this abuse that they talk about was, but apparently we just didn't know what to look for.
---
Still not sure how that's a personal attack at specific developers, though. Sounds more like a joke about a game.
---
That looks more like an eagle or a raven than an owl, but gods know what corruption could make to an owl. 
---
The only owls I've seen being corrupted had corrupting spikes on them, and we freed them before they could get corrupted, or died if we didn't save them.
---
Elon Riverlands, the sand dunes in Prophet's Path are wonderful to travel through when the sandstorm is happening.
---
The secret Abaddon shrine in The Desolation.
---
The hidden Sylvari home in the North of Bloodtide Coast.
---
Bitterfrost Frontier forest.
---
Dry Top, The Cavern of Shining Lights.
---
That's just a few off the top of my head.
---
Change the word "weekend" to "ever" and this would be accurate haha... It's a business, it will continue to behave like one.
---
Take off your rose tinted glasses. Content release was much slower back then. We got 3 maps, 1 dungeon path and maybe 3 fractals in the first 3 years. Then came HoT followed by almost another year of no releases. 
---
There are some legit reasons for frustration, but mismanagment? We get more, larger and higher quality releases than in most of the games lifetime.
---
Her own opinions aren't the company official stance. They can be close or even exactly the same, but these are still her opinions.
---
lol
---
On one hand I totally agree with that sentiment, but on the other hand, isn't solving this problem the job of public relations employees? I personally wouldn't want to be in their shoes right now, and I think they are really being treated much worse than they deserve right now, but it's still someone's job to make sure the company saves face here because the community response right now is benefitting noone
---
I really don't see a lot of rule breaking borderline or not in [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cybkxj/rubi_about_toxicity_and_feedback_part_2_the_saga/) tho...
---
Okay let's not go that far, Trump is too much of a dumb ass to drool on himself while whining about the media not liking him.
---
Don't make me cry!
---
Every single person playing an MMO knows a new class/job/profession/elite spec is *the* thing that will get them interested. If they had plans for new elite specs, they would have been the huge reveal at that event. They didn't book a theatre, invite people from around the world, gaming journalists, stream it live on twitch with a two day countdown to not include new elite specs.
---
No, but, as I said, they represent the opinions of someone higher up on the ArenaNet's marketing team and should be seen as such.
---
&gt; Anet is good, as every other spoiled millenial, at igoring anything
---
oh wow we're even at this point now?
---
Im goin to pretend you didnt just blame the player base for the state of the game, the company’s practices or the entire show that this is, You clown. 
---
This game has one of the most supportive communities behind it. They were right . There is a major content drought in GW2 its a cycle that Anet uses,  i actually thought they got their content formula right with Istan. Anet killed that one but i guess its the player fault they played the content. 
---
The problem is that LS content, Most times the maps go dead within the first month, any GW2 player can tell you the wait time for a new map. Its not fun, they are doing a LS vs an expansion this go around, People literally just want information from a Q&amp;A that didnt even happen. Is that the players fault too? No i dont think so , Anet REFUSES to communicate unless a Dev or social media worker feels attacked, then we have this situation , we all get listed as people who harass, toxic people, but most importantly Anet puts the victim complex on and trys to be the saint. 
---
This is turning into a regular event by Anet, more then the Q&amp;A event. And its a shameful practice to even turn the playerbase on itself while they Review the Questions and come up with a good excuse
---
Yeah I am thinking it should be like the Box of Fun where you can drop it down then the owner can interact to adjust stats
---
&gt; The primary reason people are mad is litterally because they only said what they were working on without giving specific dates.
---
it really, really isn't. people are mad because they announced virtually nothing.
---
if that *had* given dates for alliances / build templates, we could at least count those as additional pieces of news, but since we know exactly as much now as we did before the announcement (they will exist at some point) they don't count. the lack of date isn't the problem here; it's the parading of old information as if it's new hype. a date would just switch it over to actual new information.
---
had they announced additional new content like raids without dates people would be less upset, not more.
---
&gt; SPEAK WITH YOUR WALLET!
---
​Sesaon 5 is free.
---
Because the mods are doing an incredible job to keep this community free of abusive behaviour of which doesn't belong here.
---
Comments were removed but there were multiple harrasment comments against Rubi as well as other members.
---
Releasing the specs gradually would just lead to massive imbalance during the interim, leading to the whiny gamers on here bitching and harassing the devs even more.
---
And given the content thats been released in LW, paid episodes wouldn't make much money. Even if ANet wants LS5/Saga to have expansion level content, players are likely going to expect the same LW quality and not want to pay for it.
---
Raiding is repeatable content. It has kept me in the game for years. Story you play once is not what keeps people in mmos.
---
But tell that to all the successful mmos with raiding. FF14 is killing right now as the raid alternative to BFA, which had an exodus with the state of the game. That could have been gw2.
---
We don't need multiple threads calling out individual ANet employees. It starts becoming less of a discussion and more targeted harassment. Rubi is not a sacrificial lamb to be tossed to the wolves.
---
[deleted]
---
&gt; the people doing this garbage
---
thx I couldnt find this one in the wiki food part! ^^
---
they will dodge any questions about it like they always do
---
PvE is also repetitive.  I don't really understand your comment.
---
&gt;a new campaign. 
---
Simply not going to happen for gw1. I would abandon all hope for such an occurance. They didnt even bother finishing the Beyond content.  
---
&gt;I swear if they did that, it would explode in popularity again. 
---
If that were to happen the player base would increase but it never reach a major peak again.  
---
&gt;It still has a very large player base even today. (Bots not included)
---
How are you defining "very large"?
---
In that case she should've not tried to attack the criticism of the players and do the same as all the other 250 employees at ArenaNet and kept her mouth shut.
---
Yeah all that belongs here is amateur fanart, fanfic and "After x years" post right next to the "Best community" shit.
---
Point the finger at myself? Sorry but you don't seem to understand me :P What i was trying to say with my first post was calm the hell down everyone. I'm not pointing at anyone. I just find it hilarious how people are litterally demanding an excuse from Anet because they didn't like what Anet has presented. If you didn't catch it before i am disappointed as well and i hate what they had to show in that presentation so i'm not defending Anet here either. The amount of drama however is not justified. It's a game.
---
I'll check it out
---
To be blunt my main concern is that the Charr behave like Charr and the Norn behave like Norn, I like some of the writing but I do feel that there’s a bit too much human that could end up being written into races that really are not human. I am very much expecting Charr to end up looking too cute like pwetty little cats or something that aimed more towards Disney style of “lion” (You know who I’m talking about) and not the rough around the edges, cruel, battle scarred race that they are (and a bit more canine than some would expect too sometimes I feel). 
---
I have similar fears for the Norn, time will tell us though I suppose its just a matter of Anet actually realising they have lore that they have to follow and while its nice to put some human traits in one or two characters that are not human it should be something unique amongst those characters and not something that every member of the race will show.
---
&gt; The problem with WvW is that it's like super boring PvE, but with occasional PvP stuff in it. 
---
It really wasn't until they added the warclaw so now every dude who sees you hops on it and runs away so they can hit the next door safely.
---
The bird in the trailer is a hawk or eagle. I'm not sure why folks keep thinking it's a raven [it's not black?] or an owl [not even close.]
---
I'd be surprised if we didn't learn that at least one of the the Spirits left behind got corrupted, though. Would make for an interesting fight and be a challenge for the Norn as a people, much like the whole Balthazar incident was for humans.
---
This. GW is a game you can pause and resume later without the problems you may have on a vertical progression game. Go back to your game backlog, or try FFXIV, ESO, whatever, or even learn another language/an instrument with this free time !
---
Thanks for you input, we don't really have like a thousand posts identical to this one
---
/r/KarmaCourt ?
---
In the website store the deluxe store says that it does includes extra character slot and the other extras, not sure in the gem store
---
Not much to be done there, there are some legit reasons for people to be upset and they are the kind that anet really doesn't plan to fix. It just feels like a massive wave of toxic due to the combined nature of this drama with the ERP drama, as the worst parts of both sort of merged since they had similar mindsets.
---
They pretty much always respond when people are this pissed off. Same thing happened with the whole JP ordeal. Reddit raged over the weekend, then everyone showed up the next week and corporate came up with a strategy.
---
No, on their private accounts they represent only themselves.
---
I agree, at the end is obviously is the hawk from the start just corrupted by Jormag. Still, would be  interesting to see If they do something with the Owl spirit that Jormag consumed.
---
People even complain about free stuff these days.
---
even telling us "we were hit hard, we need 2 more months to recover/be able to do ... /etc, here is what we're planning, remember that it may change" would be better than "..."
---
I'm gonna be honest, I didn't expect the "YOU DAMN MILLENIALS!!!!" to be used against Anet instead of defending Anet.
---

---
This thing is everything but an owl.
---
You calling someone abusive is toxic. lmao
---
Prologue is free. I dont think that they stated anything about s5, but I could be wrong.
---
Dayun bunch of whisper agents cutting up apples in here
---
How can they read any form of critique they receive when they police forums and delete posts.THATS READING YUP
---
Why would they address it? And why is the only alternative utter silence?
---
The community being upset about the uncertain future apparently isn't a factor for the people making the decisions, from their point of view they had a great announcement of the upcoming ~~season~~ saga. Or maybe they simply can't disclose the information we want because of orders from higher up, who knows?
---
Further communication leading up to the prologue will likely just be more information about the prologue and episode 1&amp;2 of the saga. Maybe they'll announce a GW2 themed tea warmer or something, too.
---
If anything I expect more of the same "some people are rude to us, please stop. Oh, also, if you want to get a reaction out of us you'll have to be toxic." as a reaction to the "drama".
---
So, in short, why would they not just do business as usual?
---
I'd love for them to address our concerns and tell us what to expect for the future but with the way communication has been in the past I'm not expecting them to tell us anything that didn't get the go ahead from above. That they didn't use their big announcement to throw us a bone suggests that no information in that regard is forthcoming.
---
They have Path of fire on sale now,  and with the upcoming change just buying PoF will also unlock Heart of Thorns for free.
---
Probably not since its gonna be with the purchase of PoF
---
Boomer alert xD
---
Um.  Um....Season 1 released new episodes every 2 weeks.  How can you say that content release was much slower for the first 3 years.  Are you high, or something?
---
Duh, why do you think i'm here on Reddit instead. I uninstalled the re-used copy pasta gemstore game right after dragonfall (btw folks like me that have been playing the game since launch and are unhappy...try uninstalling...it's the greatest feeling ever).
---
Im not expecting for anything else from arenanet, like it or leave it, and from any competitive perspective, i think is the second.
---
Time for France to finally learn English.
---
Shameful to characterize it as generational.
---
she specifically said that she responded to the harassment, not the criticism...
---
Hey just a quick question. Step 9 on the installation instructions says there should be a text file in your Exe directory after you start the game. I don't see this file anywhere. I think d912pxy is working because I'm getting better fps, but just wanted to know if maybe I installed it wrong or something because I don't see the file that is mentioned.
---
It could do wonders for the game economy. Even if you won't personally play with housing, the materials you earn from other gamemodes would sell for a better price. Not to forget that they could add sellable decorations as rewards anywhere and either you get gold by selling it on the tp, or you use it to decorate.
---
I'm torn between responses. Do I go with "I didn't know Boomers had the time to play Guild Wars considering all the Real Work they were doing" or "new chef recipe: Avocado Toast"?
---
People went on the internet. 
---
The end.
---
The sad truth is: catering to national communities by creating separate specific servers based on language seemed like a good marketing idea, but has been a thorn in the side of WvW and balancing things ever since day 1. 
---
On one hand, we hand 'national' servers back in GW1, but it never had as much impact on the gameplay side of things, or any truly large-scale communication in a whole game mode. Creating a bubble like that always leads to a disaster.
---
If alliances come, in the form we expect them to, most of that will become irrelevant, but as long as the core backbone of WvW are servers, the nationals should just be converted into international, as all the others.
---
The Boomer Saga
---
She said it after the community turned on her, you call it whatever you want it's nothing else besides damage control.
---
She actively attacked and insulted a customer and company partner. When Rubi does the same, only then you can compare those situations.
---
Btw I expected you playing JP cars two posts ago.
---
Yes, I can, because they're not our parents, they're a company that's trying to get us to buy their product. 
---
This whole thing is a massive, massive fuckup-- perhaps not on the level of wondering if people had phones or not, but pretty damn close to it. I think it's pretty telling that even people like WoodenPotatoes is disappointed in this. Not to mention all those people who suddenly find themselves worrying about the future of the game because of this.
---
along with the whole "it's not an owl" stuff everyone is posting, I believe it's been stated by the havrouns that owl is completely gone. I know that may not mean much but I'd be willing to bet that it's the missing spirits who got corrupted, and indeed owl is consumed and dead
---
JP isn't the only example in the industry, but just because what JP said was much worse it doesn't cancel what I'm saying here. How you behave in your personal social media account represents you as a part of a company.

or maybe she addressed the harassment she was sent? why is this even relevant? why do you care so much about her tweets?

man i dont care about any of that, just answering your question ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
maybe if youre karen and frequently ask for the manager. a normal person is capable of comprehending that she didnt speak for arenanet nor did she mean to adress the criticism.
---
If you look at the patches for POE the design ethos is completely different, instead of tacking a little more to the end of the current list of content, they add a new mechanic to every bit of content in the game.
---
In Gw2 this could be things like the bloodstone craze, or jokos minions. Have the show up everywhere for 3 months, have unique collections and rewards for that time, then when the next launch hits do new ones.
---
Almost all areas of the game could be effected and it could even grant some reason to revisit old maps.
---
Imagine the bloodstone crazed beast event on steroids, 30% of the mobs on a map become bloodstone crazed and have a couple of extra abilities and are tougher, but have a unique material drop that you can grind for, the bloodstone crazed beasts also exist and are surrounded by a pack of crazed mobs.
---
Yeah I don't see it
---
Yes, I can also see it any other day. As for the sub right now...well 3 of the front page posts are exactly within the set of what I just mentioned...even now.
---
I dont think they expect an answer from anet on a weekend, but i think the lack of communication has hit the boiling point, Rubi and Medina have only worsened things by calling us toxic, saying we harass them and how they deserve kudos, its quite shameful
---
I think people are freaking out a bit too much. I've been playing the game since release, I get being disappointed but it's clear the restructuring and firing of employees really affected the game. Yea, they lied about it bot having an impact on the game but what were they supposed to say? There are hundreds of companies that say the same thing every year. It's just how business works.
---
Oh please. Take your tampon out and let it breath. Don’t like it?  Don’t play it!
---
I mean....they certainly fucked the environment like dragons do.
---
Do I really need to go over this again or could you just read my comments to the other guy? She said something as a higher-up at ArenaNet's marketing team, while she did not speak for ArenaNet she did speak as a person of importance at ArenaNet.
---
&gt; nor did she mean to adress the criticism
---
No, she did, you're all just believing what you want to believe.
---
You want to know why players are frustrated, bored, unsatisfied? Uncertainty. 
---
When I bought GW2 at launch I knew I was up for a ride for at least 5 to 7 years, play or no play I could pick it up anytime in that time and it will be there. I  crammed for half a year,  got bored and returned bit after PoF launch. It was all within the expected, I was very happy with the game, avoided all the drama that was going on in the past years and had a good half a year to a year of content to play at my convenience. I dropped probably 300-500$ on the game on top of basics, like any reasonable adult with no kids would have on something that eats a substantial chunk of week. 
---
But then ANet downsized 160 people. Which was proceeded by creeping influx of cash items. Now, everyone knows that online game dies when it overreaches with pay mechanics and drops key creatives. Which kind of happened? Now I don't know what to think, whether I should invest any more time or money in something that is on its last legs or maybe just drop it entirely, cut my time now and do something else. 
---
I don't subscribe to cancel culture, I, at 28, am to old for outrage culture, but now I honestly don't know what to think. Players are in a loose loose situation when if they invest time and money in a game that shows signs of decomposition they are robbed of it. And if they boycott ANet GW dies anyway.  Without the roadmap and effort to convince players that game has a future, without a clear plan to release features that are second coming of christ at this point there is no incentive to play the game. Because of the very real risk of all of it going to shit. 
---
Oh and if you are working in any capacity with social media in 2019 and don't understand how radicalization works maybe, just maybe, it's time to change careers.
---
Of course Anet is greedy, it's a company of humans and humans are greedy.
---
Amount of assets, voiced lines, covered size (maps), unique features (such as mount), number of archivements, number of in game rewareded armor skins, number of in game rewarded weapon skins, number of events per map in regards to other ls releases, number of non-ls-non-festival events, number of VA lines per release… All of these have gone up. Now pure quantity is not the same as quality, but the production value of the maps has also gone up significantly. Do you mean to tell me that any LS S4 release has added less content and value than say… Season 3 Episode 1?
---
(Sorry for my English, is my second language)
---
There's NO way, NO way, that anet was thinking on doing a live presentation for the announcement of lws5,  they just love the radio silent treatment and 0 interaction with the comunity, maybe they just wanted to do a post + the trailer, either this was ncsoft forcing them to do this or they are not generating the money that ncsoft was expecting, because the only thing that I saw on the presentation was desperation, they showed some amazing things and maybe there is more for the season well "saga" as they called, but they were so vague with it, it's obvious that is too early to show them, for me this was, show something for people to keep supporting us.
---
Every time they interact with the comunity this happens, because they can't stand ANY criticism, they antagonize the entire comunity for a little bit of cynicism and some trolls, so sad to see this happen, but they let the snowball get so big that they can't stop it now, shame that the potential of this game is being wasted by a company that never learned how to deal with his community and the solution is so simple, just communicate more often, be honest, talk to us!!, hilarious.
---
Yes it was great, why?
---
Well I'm glad someone spoke out about toxicity, now I'm sure all the trolls will just stop trying to deliberately piss people off. . .
---
oh, wait. . .
---
that's not how any of this works, is it. 
---
:(
---
You realize VB t4 is done daily? And when was the last time AB, Gerent or DS failed? Those were great pre-nerf and they are still fun, but they are also pretty much unfailable.
---
From the look of this reddit, the game is dying. From playing the game, I can assure you,. at least in the areas I'm playing, the game is not dying. It's not close to dying. Quarterly reports don't show the game dying. Stuff getting done in game doesn't show the game dying. So I'm not sure what you mean by in trouble.
---
If you mean less people play many modes than they used to, that's undeniably true and probably true of a lot of MMOs. If you're going to say that a certain percentage of the playerbase is dissatisfied, that's undeniably true. But there are people who are variously sorta but not totally satisfied. Do you know how many games I've played for years I was 100% satisfied with? Exactly none.
---
Saying that there is dissatisfaction in an MMO is not very different from saying people complain about anything. You do something for long enough, you start seeing the flaws. That's true for anything. I put over 20,000 hours in this game, of course I see flaws. Who wouldn't. But I'd see flaws in ANY game I put the same amount of time into. 
---
It's a seven year old game. The code is old. The devs make mistakes (which also happens with every game I've ever played), but this community has a much louder portion of dissatisfied people, the hard core community right now. The biggest complaints I see most often are raiders, WvWers and PvPers. Sure there there are other people dissatisfied. But I know WvWers and PvPers that are satisfied as well, some who play almost exclusively those modes. But they're not likely what you would call hard core.
---
I'd like not to paint any community with one brush but reddit is not a good place to see if the game is doing well or not.  People kepe repeating stuff like the game is in trouble. The game is probably in a better place than most 7 year old MMOs. It's not a superstar like WoW was at 7 years, but it has more competition, and didn't start off with the same advantages.  For years we ran neck and neck with Final Fantasy XIV, but they were able to release on console and that gave them a pretty big advantage, not to mention it was Final Fantasy XIV. That's means there were 13 games before it. It had a following,  not just in the US but in Asia. That's a huge boon for a game's numbers.  But we're still not that far from where ESO is and that game did launch on console as well. We're better off as far as I can tell than SWToR which has a major studio and a major franchise behind it. We're better off than Archeage unless their new strat leads somwhere. I won't even talk about Rift.
---
In the Pantheon of MMOs this one is a successful one, not a dying one. If you guys don't want to acknowledge that, that's fine. But let's complain about the features we're lacking, without all the doom and gloom, because reasonable people are going to look past that hyperbole anyway. This game is in a good place for a company with pretty much 2 products set in the same universe, that's not available on consoles, that's not a famous IP. There aren't many MMOs that have done better in the West.  I think that says something.
---
I've been going around to various zones, including LS 3 and LS 4 zones and there's still plenty of activity. I've gone around in HoT and POF and there's still plenty of activity. I've been going around in Core zones and there's still plenty of activity.
---
We dont' have the same multimaps of AB like we used to that's true. Because AB is older and there are far more zones now, and you can't multimap it. People have certainly spread out more.
---
Think about it. Was HoT busier when we had 4 zones of HoT and the core world. Sure. But when you add six zones of LS 3, 5 zones of POF, 6 zones of LS 4, of course people will spread out.  Zergs will be smaller. I don't know about you but my event timer is busier than it's been, and that doesn't count the other events Anet keeps throwing at us, in addition to all that.
---
How would anyone even know how well the game is doing, I guess that's my question. I'll tell you one thing. I don't think reddit is the best indicator and it never has been.
---
You really can't say that content came slower during the first 3 years of gw2.  That's simply disingenuous.  We got a ton of content.  The signs in wayfarers was the first release of LS 1, and to claim that it was indicative of the content of that season is ridiculous.

Living world season 2 started in july of 2014. and ended jan 13th 2015 (and as I recall, there was an extra long gap between episode 7 and 8, of about a month, when other episodes were ~ 2 weeks apart.)
---
So, for the first 2 and a half years of gw2, we got 23 content releases.  Since HoT released almost 4 years ago, we got 2 expansons, and 12 living story episodes.
---
We got way more content in the first 3 years then we did in the past 4.
---
It's always been that way. It might be a *different* variety of super boring PvE, but with occasional PvP stuff in it these days, but it's never once *not* been super boring PvE, but with occasional PvP stuff in it.
---
"why even" indeed. would be quite unfair to compare the entirety of the PoF *announcement* to just the IBS *trailer,* which btw is a beauty to look at.
---
Going by that definition every game is dying. Sure, WoW is dying because it has less players than it did years ago. That's the answer we're all looking for.
---
There's such a thing as a stable population. People come and go but this game as a relatively loyal casual population. Why that population exists we can speculate, but it's there. And sure some people leave, but some new people start too, and some of them because part of the stable population but probably many don't, depending on their experiences in game. Saying a game doesn't have more players than it did in the first three years after 7 doesn't mean the game is dying. I don't know about you, but I'm still finding groups for everything I do.  Maybe raids are different or PvP, I can't say, but all the stuff I do I find people for, everywhere, in every zone.  So yeah, I wouldn't call that dying.
---
but to say that new players stand no chance at all is blowing things out of proportion.  
---
the warclaw mount is not a power creep. its a useful tool but not a be all end all that can kill everybody.  
---
my point is that having a mount and not having a mount is a very minor difference and imo the mount is just there for convenience.  
---
any deadeye can just cloak off and escape easily btw.  
---
also open squad commanders do not use warclaw when running zergs for the obvious reason that not everybody has it and you cant take objectives when mounted. i do not make this up. obviously non open squad comms run in mount but open ones just walk like the old days.
---
also, the reward track with all +% wvw reward track boost only takes about 2-3 hrs to complete the warclaw track even with tier 3 participation.  
---
ultimately, casual players should not be deterred to just go in wvw and have fun.
---
Player housing has to be the most unimportant feature Anet could develop right now.
---
In game rewards instead of gemstore bullshit

Us? Are you part of the section of community that is personally attacking devs? Then they werent talking about you. Way to play the victim card.
---
And the truth is, Living World is the easy/lazy move. Yes, it takes a lot of man hours to produce, but on the other hand the infrastructure of their company has been built the last few years to churn out Map + story instance content.
---
So the easiest thing to do is continue that formula. the hard thing to do is a pivot to some new formula.
---
People already complain about raids. 
---
If you think they will make them harder,  I have a bridge in Uganda to sell you.
---
It's so hard to resist rewatching it, when I do, I play it on the loop for quite some time..
---
But how many of those people were laid off of Guild Wars 2. You guys don't seem to get it. SWToR and TSW had bigger layoffs, and that was much closer to launch. Blizzard had layoffs. NcSoft asked or those layoffs. They were losing money on many games. Games get older, people make more, and pretty soon the budget for a company not just a game, the entire company  has to be adjusted. I've been in business myself and Iv'e seen it. I've lost track of how many times lay offs have nothing to do with how well a specific venue is doing. Sometimes it's done to please investors who need to see action taken and it sucks but that's the reality of business. 
---
You need to look at the business plan and stock calls. When you hear the words Guild Wars 2 is not meeting expectations, you know that that's an issue. And we've only heard that once and it wasn't recently. Which means it hadn't been meeting expectations and now it's probably within the expectation range.
---
Oh, another "Anet, listen to us" thread...
---
I thought it's something interesting.
---
Charr rainbow.
---
I think you are dreaming.
---
Its much, much more likely that they didnt have elite specs or an expnasion or even this season planned a year ago.
---
Now post layoffs and with the other projects on ice until further notice they try to find what they can do in 6 months, we are most likely not getting new elite specs.
---
Tho just to entertain the idea that its because of hp, i think its perfectly fair for players to have to do world exploration to get the needed hps, imo elite specs shouldn't be a 30sec deal when u log in day on of a new expansion. It would be much healthier for the game if elite specs took a bit of time to actually unlock fully.
---
&gt; but they put all their cards on the table.
---
Nope. They told us they had some cards in their desk drawer. And they were going to show us the cards later on down the road. Not surprising that pitch flopped.
---
Up until now other glyphs were better value, but now with the prices of ascended herbs bounty is far above the others, so the psa is quite reasonable
---
To be fair for me and my guildies it's the required number that's the problem. 
---
If there was let's say 5man version with half the rewards gained per boss kill but you still unlock all the stuff you can buy with currencies when you get your first kill.
---
While it would take twice the time do get a certain piece with currencies, this creates an opportunity  to get smaller groups of people into raids.
---
Hope so!
---
&gt;  Fractal players got nothing. Raid players got nothing.
---
Raid players won't get anything before Fractal players since they already got W7. Now it is turn for Fractals (if there is anything). Remember that Fractal and Raid team was merged into one.
---
&gt; This has always been and will always be a shallow arguement.
---
&gt; Monthly fee or not this is still a game the community supports financially. It's still a game the community enjoys and wants to see do well.
---
Correct. Especially considering anet makes more money from mtx than they would from the WoW business model.
---
Good of you to asked, I wonder why no one else thought of that.
---
No. That's not what the topic is about. But that explains why you replied beside the point.
---
Tarir in the Auric Basin is one of my absolute favorite places! I've gotten some really nice screenshots there myself. The hidden strawberry farm in Diessa Plateau and the hidden area of the Grove also have nice lighting and aesthetics if you haven't explored them yet.
---
Too bad, I'm gonna say that this sub has been 100% despicable over the past few days. The way all of you have been treating Anet because they didn't reach the hype that you personally had in your heads makes normal players sick to their stomach.

it is but wow has a giant ass pop , gw2 does not, that's why neither of them release sub mode. except they dont come, everyone thinks the game is dead and ppl who tried it early said its garbage. You find 1 filled map for every event on ET , not 3-4 like before, 1
---
Hello there, my friend. 
---
Anet here, and yes and expansion is coming very soon. Thank you for playing the game, also buy more gems.
---
But there are MORE events. So the event that's not filling 3 servers now in AB is not an indication of anything because we have so many more maps AND events. Sure less people are running each meta, when there are more metas.  PoF metas are getting done now. So you have more things to split the player base. You can't tell from that how large the player base is.  Not unless you have a snapshot from the top down seeing every player in every area. We know populations are down in WvW, that much we do know. But again, you have to look at all players across all servers. With WvW you can do that. You can't with PvE.

English stands as the most necessary language to learn nowadays. I'm not a native speaker and I still can't feel bad for anyone that is too lazy to learn what is essentially the language of *the world*
---
I'm fairly certain the S5 episodes will still be unlocked by logging in during the window, but you'll ALWAYS get the prologue episode if you own the PoF expansion.
---
even if they didn't give us any of this information, I'd settle for them just telling us if the money NCSoft gave them for the now-cancelled projects was money NCSoft would have given them to increase GW2 development. a simple answer to that question would go a long way towards determining how I should feel about GW2's progress and decision-making. 
---
if that funding was just earmarked by NCSoft for the other project, then I don't feel so bad about Anet's progress on GW2, since it could just a problem of lack of funding. however, if Anet would have received that portion of funds regardless, then I'd be upset they chose to skimp on GW2 to waste money on the other project.

"toxic" is a buzzword used to play victim
---
They may have hinted at it using the term saga instead of the living world season.
---
The way they treated it is pretty ambiguous. All we can do is wait and see.  That's the most logical step instead of raging or calling the game dead.
---
Oh we do have years before the game goes down. And while I'm a PvP/fractal player I do enjoy living world a lot. My biggest worry is that this revenue thing might lead to more aggressive monetization. Only time will tell that though. 
---
To be fair however, I do a lot of open world and the living world content has started to feel repetitious as well. I'm not speaking just a PvP player.
---
Most devs cherry pick who they want to listen to and which issues they want to address publicly (which doesn't necessarily mean your concern hasn't been heard though).
---
Unless there's a truly massive outrage where such a large percentage of the playerbase comes together as to make it a "game over" type of deal should it get ignored (like the Jita Protests in EVE Online) the devs own the conversation in large part and even devs with the a very community friendly reputation will use that to their advantage to wipe things under the rug on occasion.
---
The difference, of course, being that good devs will get away with it due to community goodwill, while devs that have already used up their goodwill will just create a sourer and sourer environment.
---
As to other players reacting poorly to polite critique, calling someone "toxic" (or any other ad-hominem, really) is just a cop-out because they don't want to hear the actual argument, they don't want to hear there is a problem with the game (or the devs). In my experience this is most often done by players in the "honeymoon" stage, where they're still in love with the game and everything is perfect to them, anything that threatens to shatter this bubble is considered a threat and they respond in kind.
---
You made my day with this reply :)
---
I just received mine now. Don't be in too much of a hurry, it's pretty underwhelming. There is the glider skin which I don't mind. But the "Armour Pack" is not a full set. It is a choice of a collection of masks and such. These are not even a permanent wardrobe unlock, they are all single use items.
---
When I bought HoT I paid $35 for content I hated. I still hate it all to this day with the exception of AB. Sigh....
---
I agree with you, about the money situation. We might see more aggressive monetization and that is absolutely a worry.  And yes, anything I do for 10,000 hours feels repetitive.  I don't see how that's a judge of anything. I felt the same about Guild Wars 1 six years in.
---
Yea, I'm not sure how this ends well for Rubi.  I like the lady so I'd hate to see her get in trouble but you're right.  The twitter bio ties her to Anet, just like Price, and that was part of why Price got canned.
---
Orders of magnitude difference in what was said, tho.  I really hope Rubi is fine when this is all said and done.
