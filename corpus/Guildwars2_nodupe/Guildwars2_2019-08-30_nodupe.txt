Guild Wars 2

Living W"orld"

ಠ_ಠ

---
Link? :P
---
It does well enough for my needs in PvE. I don't really follow the min/max of classes. I generally run Staff/Staff Mirage. But when running trains, I run Axe/Focus for the 4 Skill Speed Boost as I'm always on foot so I don't leave people without mounts behind.
---
I made an account just to talk about this. Arenanet and the Guild Wars series will always hold a special place within me.   
---
I discovered Guild Wars Prophecies back when I was in middle school, through a friend who played it at the time. I don't remember exactly, but I think he found the game a bit boring at the time (he later returned to it a few years later). The late nights I had through leveling, capturing skills, exploring sorrow's furnace over and over again...man, that's my childhood and I'll never regret those years. I met some really cool people in game, and had a relationship with someone special for a little over two years. I met some strong IRL friends through this series, and Arenanet will always have my thanks for that.   
---
I've been around this series since a year after the beginning. I remember stealing Factions from Wal-Mart (couldn't afford it), and for Nightfall..I walked myself to the store and bought it around midnight. I've been playing Guild Wars 2 since head start and I haven't really taken much of a break from it. I'm currently in my last semester of graduate school and I still play...albeit not nearly as much. Thanks for everything, Anet! You may not get everything right, and that's okay...love you all the same and will probably be playing years ahead from now!
---
then shouldn't you be asking why the game comes with 5 character slots as well?
---
Yeah seriously. I've played MTG before I even got into Guild Wars and his artwork he's done for WoTC is crazy. Here's probably my favorite one that he's done  [https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/f/f/ff204024-20a5-4bb9-82b6-f6b4337efd60.jpg?1552226335](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/large/front/f/f/ff204024-20a5-4bb9-82b6-f6b4337efd60.jpg?1552226335)
---
[YES!](https://media.giphy.com/media/Lr3UeH9tYu3qJtsSUg/giphy.gif)
---
Rough screenshot, I panicked. Kinda looks like Eir in the shiver peaks, there is a Charr with a flaming sword standing behind them. I assume Rytlock
---
There are 6 total weapons that an ele can potentially use: staff, dagger, scepter, focus, warhorn (HoT), sword (PoF)
---
You can also make other characters from different professions and use for them.
---
I dont see the livestream on on IG. Maybe they took it down?
---
Oh man, imagine the potential. The player character charging into the Shiverpeaks alongside the full might of the charr war machine. A group of warbands manipulated in the same way as the Sons of Svanir into fighting for the dragon. A mixture of the Blood Legion Homelands and the Shiverpeaks environs as the ice dragon steadily expands its domain east.
---
The only way the got to be such a massive MMO was marketing to casuals tired of a subscription fee. If they did this, I personally would leave as well as many others.
---
&gt; It was created for large groups (at least three) 
---
Is this a joke. No offense, but this is a ripe moment to say "Git Gud"
---
The interview is over :( it was suuuper quick. I just saw a notification on my phone and rushed to see it before it ended. It was super echoey as I think they were just standing in a hallway? Couldn't understand much.
---
It was only up for like 5 minutes, the livestreams on IG aren't saved after they end, I believe.
---
"I panicked" this is a mood. I'm so excited I can't sleep
---
Shame! they were quick in taking it down, probably a mistake. And yes they arent saved indeed.
---
And oddly enough they don't cater to the minority who restricts themselves to one thing. Shocking, I know!
---
I should mention btw: i was a huge gw1 fan, tried gw2 for a few months, then quit pretty much entirely for about 2 years, only ever logging on for a bit during the end of lion's arch story.
---
As a fan of GW1 it wasn't at all what I wanted.  And even now, I'd like a potential GW3 to bring back some of the stuff I'm missing about the mechanics and theming of GW2, though I've warmed to it now.
---
This is just to say GW1-2 wasn't a smooth transition for everybody, and there are always going to be people who drop off during series transitions.
---
I'm currently playing Destiny, and I straight left the match I was in to watch the livestream.
---
Read the comment again, im not saying that Anet is going to fail
---
I'm saying that unrealistic hype can lead to disappointment because the hype train doesn't care about what is practical - a hype train is more like a wish list that everyone has an opinion about, and at the end of the day, people can only get upset
---
I don't mind playing on the Desert Borderlands, but it suffers a bit from having a bunch of narrow passages and choke points that discourage engaging the enemy unless you're suicidal or they're AFK. Add to that a lot of winding roads and verticality and you get a lot of extra travelling to get around those choke points.
---
I think most organised groups play for the fights, so anything that stands in the way of that is seen in a negative light. I think people playing other game modes would react the same way if arenanet implemented changes that arbitrarily slowed down what they were doing.
---
I just want Seimur to sell me the typical materials I might need, without having to go to another cook.
---
they can drop 3 varietal seeds (maybe more?) per node. no other node i've found has acted that way i'm guessing it's unintended
---
you downvote because I ask a question. Great "Community"
---
I see, thanks. Do you have a build for fighting in PvE at hand?
---
3-4 times a year is too slow of a content flow though. Either the content gets blazed through in a couple days, or it's artificially extended by external time gating. *Especially* when raids and fractals are taking turns and a new raid wing represents much more one-time and repeated content than a fractal does. Once "solved", a new fractal adds *variety* to the fractal community's daily routine, but a new raid adds *another thing to do per week* forever to the raider's weekly routine.
---
Nobody's out there competing for world first on new fractal releases, and the "lab work" on fractals isn't as in depth as the stuff for raids is. Raids give the "release day blind run" one time content which brings very memorable moments, as well as first time CM content, and then leaves a whole wing behind to do every week and optimize and experiment with.
---
I can't tell if this is a joke
---
its like saying Condi warrior was viable using base warrior
---
There is a reason why new specs have new weapons and traits. The importance of the two aforementioned things are so vital to how well something can function
---
This conversation is ridiculous- no one needs to explain this to you wtf...
---
You are wrong in judging me
---
Oh I know, still makes no sense lol. Salvage gear and you break it down to the metal, leather, cloth, runes, etc. Salvage an omelette, you're somehow completely reverse cooking it back into an egg lol
---
The return of the Stone Summit Dwarves would be a truly WTF announcement. Didn't only the Deldrimor turn to stone?
---
If they did they they'd be better off switching to a sub fee, and neither would make the playerbase happy. GW2's *biggest* selling point is the low barrier to entry compared to other MMOs.
---
You delete you post because of some downvotes? How "self-loyal"
---
Living World episode will be free but they will charge for the elite specs if there are any.
---
&gt; Tin foil hat on- new elite specs coming as part of LWS 5!!!!!
---
More like... reasonable assumption.
---
that's actually really epic
---
They better give me icebrood customization for Norn and Charr!
---
Imo WoW was better when it was newer, gold was harder to get, and it wasn't free to play.  I think MMO cycle from new and novel to old and tired and end up as a trainwreck of conflicting foci...
---
Multi-classing pleaaaaaase. I would LOVE me some WaMo again.
---
It was very echoey and hard to make out what the dev was saying.
---
I could make out that it’s obviously going to be about the next living story, but they will also be talking about ingame events (similar to what we’ve had lately with the champion and meta bash) and other gamemodes.
---
"I bought it at circuit city" makes you old enough to also say "rented a movie at blockbuster" and "I can't wait for my Netflix to arrive in the mail".
---
Dude we're getting old
---
That's one high impact booty
---
Thats a thicc dev
---
What does he mean by core swap icons?
---
yeah, i know the logic behind it
---
/facepalm
---
Another idiot trying to wag his "epeen" around.  Sorry, but you fail.
---
I should hope that GW3 is unlikely, that would seal the end of my engagement with the franchise
---
I think it was a gw1 joke
---
Curious too. Only thing to come to mind is the profession skills steal wrekend thing.
---
Yes! Specially for Charr.
---
icons used in a recent (and very buggy/exploitable) wvw event.
---
this would be cool, actually.  this is more of what i want from the story now that we've finished setting up an interesting status quo. (took a long time to fix the kind of stale situation gw2 began in)
---
Amazing art! What are the places to see your art?
---
Treat it like 0% and then get pleasantly surprised if you get something. Ghostly infusions are more common than the other unique things but not by enough to make it a statistically probable thing short term.
---
*-Laughs at your downvotes and* **STILL** *think you're right-*
---
Your comment screams new player and its very telling that you would rather breeze through content instead of working for it
---
You wont make it far in this game, just saying
---
I know this is satire, but how amazing would it actually be to have something like that? Oh boy.
---
The "new mount" one isn't unlikely, it feels like any big updates lately have added a mount, between the pvp mount and the dragon which weren't too far apart.
---
when does priory historian elissa change the bounty hunter recipe she sells?? GW2 Wiki says she changes the recipe daily but she has been selling bounty hunter gloves for what seems like the past three days lmao.
---
Winter is coming I guess?
---
I feel so yesterday saying that :(
---
technically necromancers have pets, that do your bidding. but if you are talking about taming world pets and using them then Ranger is the only class.
---
"Other survival games" 
---
GW2 isn't a survival game.
---
Also, it really sounds like you think someone at Anet possobly read a fake leak on reddit and then went to pitch it at a dev team meeting
---
d00d if anyone could put a word in with the powers that be...
---
I think they do it once a while every few months they ban a bunch of accounts after investigation and reports are made.
---
If they even hint it I am going to jizz my pants.
---
Depending on sales:
---
* $25-$50 for both expansions
---
* $10-$16 for Season 2
---
* $9-$12 for Season 3
---
* ~$12 for Season 4
---
$56-90 for everything.  Not bad for hundreds of hours worth of entertainment.
---
Based on [this deleted tweet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cw7c47/deleted_tweet_maybe_incoming_sale/), there is a decent chance the past Living World Seasons will go on sale again soon.
---
see i *hated* that bit, because there were always 2 veteran harpy spellbreakers up there which are such a pain to fight
---
...and exactly what makes me a "douchebag"? Pointing out the idiocy of people in GW2 subreddit?
---
I bet on new dungeons or rework, build template and new elite specs. New trinket legen and new history ofc.
---
I feel you, its the issue with the most game when they have a lot of player base and different types of gameplay, PvP, PvE, WvW and raids. i'm very optimistic about the future , so lets hope for the best
---
Im also waiting for Horizons Mount showcase video, im very curious about leaping effects, trails, glowings, sounds, etc.
---
yeah, POI shows up when you have the area uncovered too.
---
Well devs have to get their ideads from somewhere. Look at a game like warframe taking inspiration from games like rocket league(lunaro), Assassin's Creed &amp; Shadow of Middel Earth(new boss system comming up) and using them to creat own ideas. So why shouldn't a MMO like GW2 take ideas from other genres and adapt them?
---
I am *always* excited about new Charr customizations. Maybe we'll get new markings after all these years.
---
Came here to say this
---
They probably don't need to do that, and they very likely shouldn't either. It would be possible for them to monetize the hell out of LS5 with gem store content to generate revenue. Then they can keep their business model intact and avoid all the unpleasantness associated with any kind of change in gaming....
---
New non-dragon bad guy? Someone completely new?
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if instead of full-blown elite specs for LS5 they introduced dual professions from GW1. I always suspected the WvW event we got to be some sort of stress test/prototype.
---
I’m not sure if I would like this or if I’d rather have actual elite specs. Two professions could mean access to more weapons, nice combos and stuff, but I’d rather have an entire elite spec, it feels more refreshing.
---
Dang...im checking twitch like every 2-3 hours, now i can sleep.
---
Well, it'd be a lot better than a LS5. I haven't even done LS3 and I doubt old players are coming back for a LS5 lol.
---
Sounds a little like Bitterfrost Frontier's meta?
---
The first thing I did was zoom in on the teleprompter trying to find something spicy haha.
---
Aw man, why do they spoil the picture :(
---
exactly my point, you can't use the many varied options without screwing the previous ones cause ones gonna be better at certain jobs because they power creep it
---
if they keep the powerlevels same =&gt; people complain that the previous builds are established and have no reason to buy the expo =&gt; they buff the new specs =&gt; new specs completely wreck old specs in pve, pvp , open world, u name it =&gt; game gets power creeped and nobody enjoys it.
---
I mean the PvPers are leaaving and complaining that Anet doesnt listen, WvWers are leaving and complaining that Anet doesnt do anything for them, Raiders and Hardcore PvE players are leaving and complaining that Anet doesn't give them enough content. Only people who aren't complaining are people doing the story, and everyone does the story cause there is nothing else to do.
---
I'd love to smash my shields like Cabrakan from smite
---
Mount skins are a hell of a drug.
---
Wait when was that? I missed it?
---
I hope they don't go this way. They would create so many balance issues, and while elite specs are super great for class identity dual professions destroys it.
---
&gt;Other than something like "hey guise we are bringing back GvG's from GW1 as our new premier organized pvp mode with automated tournaments"
---
Just imagine that. In a game called *Guild Wars*. Mind blown.
---
Every Scourge I've ever seen has used Scepter/Staff
---
28 and old now :(
---
Wish he'd come back and do armor designs again
---
New raid boss confirmed: Frogasor
---
Those are other games and genres, not some random posting online. Of course GW2 took ideas from other places. Hell, it seems designed to be as Not-WoW as possible. But no developer goes to reddit and says “yep, I’m going to steal that idea.” That’s not how good development works.
---
&gt;3-4 times a year is too slow of a content flow though.
---
Once every two years for the same amount of stuff makes you less impatient how?
---
Would they be able to do it without a complete new engine? Is it too early to ask for a GW3?
---
That'd actually be kinda neat. Braham having a weapon capable of killing Jormag suddenly becomes relevant, not because we're hunting down and slaying the beast, but because we're mercy-killing the tortured creature to break the Frost Legion's source of power. Braham gets his hunt, but not in the way he expected, putting down a sick animal instead of heroically slaying a monster.
---
We'd also get to discuss how slaying Jormag would affect the sleeping Primordius, given how they're apparently linked. Tying Jormag's capture to Balthazar's fiddling with the machine would also be neat - we saw first-hand that Primordius lay down in a pretty inaccessible ocean of lava, but we didn't see where Jormag collapsed, and him being captured while slumbering on the surface would be entirely plausible.
---
Of course, if the story fits _this_ well, we're probably getting something far less complex. Jormag woke up, corrupted some nearby Charr, and now we have to go kill him. But hey, I can dream!
---
I think "here's why I'm feeling X" is in a whole different category of potential discussion value from posts like "OMG X" or "OH NO Y".
---
If the poster genuinely explains why they reacted the way they did, I feel it would be unfair to remove the post.
---
My prediction would be both types of posts are going to be overshadowed by a flood of question posts that can be completely answered in a single reply - maybe a dedicated "Announcement Questions" thread could be pinned with 'sort by new' suggested to help give those posts an outlet and give mods deleting the question threads a place to direct the poster so they can get their question answered without cluttering the subreddit.
---
On the flip side, announcing another expansion would do the same for me.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/WvW_Core_Swap
---
Who gave him the name Nigel?
---
Appreciate the feedback! Will pass it on to the others. :)
---
I feel like if they say it's season 5 but at least promise a new expansion, I'll be satisfied knowing at least it's happening. You aren't wrong though, i'd want it sooner.
---
imagine the power creep when dps can bring banners and whatnot
---
You are right, not matter the spec, you got always the same core class skills from the orb.
---
But there is also the possibility of that skill steal mechanic being expanded beyond that initial WvW event.
---
Great art. Wish we had more armor like that in game.
---
They've got to give everyone at least 1-2 free spots on the voard, so i guess that was one of them.
---
We get so little official information about new stuff and yet people manage to ignore it. Go and watch the 6th anniversary video.
---
Why not just link the image directly, instead of advertising some random thread on some random board?
---
While this is true, it also means more people can actually get involved in the boss battle and get achievements/credits.
---
I remember playing in living story season 1 on Sorrow's Furnance, and while we had a consistent, solid group of people leading the effort in the boss fights, after the first few days (maybe a week, if lucky) we couldn't get enough people to really do the big, temporary but fun and rewarding boss events.
---
You had a few days of repeat wins and clears throughout the entire day, then only a few wins during the most active period, and then next to no wins. Meanwhile we would constantly read and hear about people on say, Tarnished Coast or other full/high pop servers getting wins throughout the entire period with very few losses and those players being able to net the rewards and achievements easily.
---
They are definitely not mutually exclusive.  In other words, gem sales did not stop when PoF and HoT were new.  I would guess that gem sales even spiked at that time.  
---
The OP makes a valid point, but it would be a departure from the highly touted free to play model they pushed hard years ago.   I would not mind paying a small fee for episodes in lieu of an expansion purchase.
---
I just kinda assumed it was going to be this way. :)
---
Expansion quality features and content released with each Living World story chapter. Each Living World story chapter is a DLC. All chapters combined would ultimately be the price of an expansion.
---
Would like to be able to purchase the whole Living World 5 in one go though, that'd be nice. :D
---
If nazis started drinking water in livestreams would you disavow water?
---
I hope we finally get build templates. I came back after a 3 year break and couldn't believe they still hadn't been added.
---
How would a small, one time fee for an episode be different than paying for HoT or PoF?
---
Claw of Jormag meet Jormag's Claws
---
No. No one is disavowing milk, or OK, or water. They simply report the accurate fact that people who are open white nationalists and neo-nazis are doing it. This isn't used as a sole identifier of their racist beliefs, it's simply noted as something they are doing. Like I said, prior to these dumb memes, they'd often use Nordic language, or 88, or 14 or other signalers with deniability. People don't assume every Norwegian 31 year old is a Nazi. 
---
I feel like I've been very clear, and don't know how to clarify further. If you do still have further questions, please feel free to reread what I wrote, or even the articles you linked. Suffice to say, saying anti-semitic and racist things, and then telling people who agree with you to use a silly signifier to try and undermine media reporting on common neo-nazi and white nationalist symbols, accomplishes nothing. People are fully able to distinguish context.
---
build templates are not unlikely. hell, they're almost guaranteed
---
&gt;I would not mind paying a small fee for episodes in lieu of an expansion purchase
---
Personally, I think that charging for LS episodes would have a blow back, and would be a worse business decision than releasing an expansion
---
 Nike was saying new core specializations.  Not elite specs but more gameplay variation.
---
Another expansion focusing mainly on open world again would be great for me
---
you dont have to, its fine boo. but if you want to thats also nice. if you play EU and need a buddy im there.
---
I agree
---
My father played GW1 a bit and I was allowed to watch on the side. Ever since GW2 came out I was interested in giving it a go. MMO's rarely interested me, but I liked what saw with GW2. So I bought it in 2014 after building a new PC and sticked with it since. :)
---
They should continue with what they are doing
---
[removed]
---
Except that wouldn't work for thieves, they only have main hand sword so it would be shield/dagger or shield/pistol thief.
---
How exactly would you test the balance of such things?
---
In a meta event?
---
Well if they are getting rid of expansions clearly gem store is making a lot of money. Also adding elite specs into the gem store goes against the gem store the gem store is about cosmetics only elite spec would give some players unfair advantages over other players because they spent money in the gem store.
---
"Using a series of new material drops from this fractal rework on a scribe will allow players to craft build template slots. These items will be account bound, and will unlock one template slot for the character when used.
---
"Furthermore, at 500 scribe can craft elite specialization guides, which will unlock a new non-expansion specialization for the account, either a locked spec for the character class, or a random locked specialization for another class if all specs for the character's class are unlocked."
---
"Disappointment."
---
Bingo?
---
R/downvotesreally
---
Disappointment (free) - i laughed too hard at this and then I cried.
---
Hungry cats for home instance? Yes. There is 1.
---
There are 9 hungry cats you feed to have added to your home instance that each require you feed it with a specific profession. So you do have to have a ranger to feed 1 of them.
---
I would be surprised. Arenanet listed the impossible to balance dual specs as one of the reaaons GW2 even exists.
---
White walkers
---
like u can buy egg sac or confetti...
---
we need to see the smile again
---
EQ was my first MMO, played an iksar SK on Zebuxoruk. So much nostalgia for EQ, but even with the WoW classic hype I can't go back, GW2 respects my time way more and is just all around more fun.
---
Why is this note important?
---
He's not my dad!
---
&gt; All psychological.
---
And everyone else should be beholden to your psychology why?
---
getting really cool LOTR vibes from this. Love to see GW2 take a darker more adult turn.
---
&gt; Well if they are getting rid of expansions clearly gem store is making a lot of money. Also adding elite specs into the gem store goes against the gem store the gem store is about cosmetics only elite spec would give some players unfair advantages over other players because they spent money in the gem store.
---
Same could be said about expansions already though...
---
wait wait. there was a time, when memes were blocked, because they are memes? what a great time, I wish I could be there .\_.
---
Yep, clove nodes give like 4 clove and 4 varietal cloves each. One reason cloves are so cheap on TP
---
Krampus?
---
If you care about the story, do NOT unlock the raptor first like people tell you to. HoT was designed specifically for the movement options available in the base game and first expansion so while adding mounts do lend a new light to the content, you’re gonna just blast through everything without experiencing it. Just do the game in order of story release.
---
wut
---
Thank you for the picture! That's fucking awesome
---
I think there is too much Asuran stuff in the game. This living season felt more Sci-fi than it did fantasy.
---
[Here is a really good guide for playing the story in order, along with supplemental material.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8wq6aj/play_gw2_in_story_order_guide/)  Wait until tomorrow night to buy them, in case they announce a sale.
---
Great guide. Very succinct and to the point, with the information presented very clearly and cleanly. Excellent production too, with the tooltips and icons.
---
Holy shit it is Krampus isnt it?
---
Random name from folks on the Twitch countdown stream when he first showed up there.
---
WvW now a battle royale, EBG is the only map, and its only playable on mobile.
---
A lot of good work, unfortunately drop tables have changed and a lot of those don't drop peppercorn anymore.  It seems like peppercorns only drop in the Shiverpeaks regions now, which severely limits our options.
---
I had broken my back and was stuck in bed with very little to do, and my roomate at the time suggested an MMO. Her favorite was Guild Wars and it had no monthly sub, so we played that. I ended up stuck in bed for over six years, so I got a lot of MMOing done! We eventually played WoW and AION as well, especially once they stopped updating the game, and moved over to GW2 when that came out after years of waiting.  
---
MMOs probably saved my life, and at the very least my sanity. When I was stuck inside and feeling pretty miserable because my lower half wouldn't work right, I could still run around in cool environments and get virtual goals done whilst looking like a badass. If I couldn't heal myself, I could at least heal my group.   
---
When I got cancer in the last few years, it once again was a good distraction and I got a lot of support in-game and here.  
---
It's part of why I've stuck with ANet despite all of their shenanigans. I'm disappointed in them as of the last couple years, but I really hope they'll turn things around. They've made a huge difference in my life.
---
Nika was always my favorite. I think they just put the most attractive girls on the covers.
---
I made a Q&amp;D cheat sheet but will need to Bitterfrost to the list. (It wasn't listed as an option for Verdant Herbs in the wiki when I originally put it together.)   
---

---
The blogpost was saying expansion worth of features, not content.
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah the healing can be really rough when people spread, rev is unique that it heals from a source that’s tethered to it, as opposed to the player itself, which I think most people aren’t used to. Most people seem to play healbrand as well, at least that’s what i see when I’m online.
---
I appreciate that, those Icons and tool tips took me the longest if I’m being honest haha! Super tedious, but I’m really happy with how it came out. Thank you!
---
 We go ~~North~~ South!

---
What is your must do world events for each days? I only know Sunless and Triple Wurm for chances of getting ascended gear.
---
Well if you buy them together, you save 10 bucks, so if you're going to keep playing, buy them both. But they might well go on sale tomorrow, so keep an eye out.
---
toxic af
---
no, the hype train will build speed til it derails under it's unreasonable expectations
---
Ummmm, really? People are going to do what they do, no matter what you post. I don't think people should be rude as a rule of them, whether they're happy or unhappy. But you know, this is the interenet and there will be rude people. Did you think asking rude people to be polite will somehow magically make that happen.
---
By the same token, some people have expectations about the game not being met and those people have a right to express themselves negatively. I'm not one of those people but their right to say so is important. It's like Voltaire said..."I may not agree with the words you say but I'll defend with my life your right to say them."
---
Well he said that in another language and there it is translated. The point is, no one gets to tell anyone what to say or even how to say it.
---
Whether they're complaining or not, I hope most people aren't rude, but you know, not to expect that to happen is a bit too optimistic for my taste.
---
lol
---
I had no idea about the livestream, thank you so much for the info!
---
OP are you drunk?
---
Would sure be nice, but it has a bit too much vertical progression and gear treadmill in it for my taste, to be actually GW2 material. Then, on the other hand, Anet has been moving away from the core philosophy for years and years now, so why not make the plunge.

Where's "LW Season 1 reintroduced"?
---
I do and what?  Not even ranger for that matter
---
Icy what you did there.
---
*All dies*.... MOTHERFUCKER
---
elite specs with off-hands as their weapon are kind of a bummer  (scourge, tempest, herald, chrono) because most 4 or 5s are on 30ish seconds long CDs.
---
Assent will always be trash.
---
put this on wiki or something
---
Yeah I saw but it did not for some reason
---
why is an interview being done on instagram :S
---
GW2 ends end so does my life peepoHang
---
You using "effected" incorrectly when you should have used "affected" did not align with my interests.
---
Quit comment development. I am uninstalling this sub and moving to /r/wowclassic . You suck.
---
unless you use frogs or bees you safe mate
---
Super sorry about that! Try it again if you have a chance. I had it listed as a private repo? changed it to public.
---
Oof, if that’s true ye I’ll laugh frantically while beating my head against a wall.
---
"Please capes!" Lol 7 years of it... 7 fucking years...
---
It works now.
---
" Will be called something like “Guild Wars 2: Flame and Frost"
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Lemme tell you about 2013 and the bullshit that was Flame &amp; Frost.
---
I would actually be very happy if they announce gw3 or a new IP, got really bored off of gw2 over the last year. A new game with a new engine and story.
---
Yay quaggan &lt;3
---
The first thing will not happen, the icons we saw were simply the remaining elite spec weapon icons. That doesn’t mean they’ll be used for that though. Especially because harpoongun is an underwater rifle and trident is an underwater staff. People speculate, and I think this is most likely, that they’ll be used for Build Templates.  
---
Second also won’t happen because they know we’re bored of dragon as main antagonist. What seems more likely to me is that someone is trying and partially succeeding in taking Jormags powers and using it to build their own army.  
---
3rd thing I wish would happen but I’m as pessimistic about that as I was about mounts in GW2.... until I saw the leaks about mounts.
---
Id recommend thief, stealth and blinds are pretty op. The use of slaying sigils and slaying utility is going to help you. And there are also some consumable items(stealth items, items to help with cc, even minions) that you should maybe look into, they are sold by various npcs across tyria.
---
Why has jormag powers of kralk? Bc it has powers of all the other dead dragons too...?
---
_Ascended_ **Stannumsheet Helm** of Understanding
---
nope. be happy if the people are at least vocal, even if you might think its rude. the worst part is, when people just leave silently
---
Pretty sure the devs have said over and over again that DX won’t change a thing. There’s something inherently wrong with how their engine deals with spreading the load on the CPU, it basically barely spreads the load and thus the CPU becomes the bottleneck.
---
It was during the cooking 500 stream
---
Get ready for blue balls then!
---
How are you so sure?
---
It was repeated time and again... this will be Living Story stuff. Expansion might be mentioned being in the works at best. More likely they will go with "Living Story can deliver expansion style content" again.
---
I command you to **[RISE](https://youtu.be/JCOSvLu8ZLY).**
---
Aren't the borderlands still the best in terms of XP, even if they suck in essentially everything else?
---
Because the model looks like that of a female Charr. It’s slimmer than the male version.
---
Missing new race
---
hey can someone tell me what the new combo and aura effect that was added in LWS4 is? my googling seems not to be good enough :(
---
Other dead dragons spread their power everywhere because no one was there to gather it.
---
Kralkatorik was a bit different. Just like Balthazar, his magic didn't spread everywhere in the world, it was absorbed by the two able powerful beings present.
---
Oooof, contact support!!!
---
I thought Aurene would have absorbed all that magic but I wouldn't be surprised if some has gone to revive both Jormag and Primordius. Moreover they probably were already half awaken due to us killing Balthazar, which should have released all their magic he previously absorbed.
---
Even in WvW I have to bring my own heal food when I FB lol.
---
Australia is across the sea. Jade Sea. Cantha confirmed!
---
Seems you were dating a psycho my dude

---
I sea what you did there.
---
Why not just LFG for more players?
---
There is definitively a change in the maps, not as much in the specific graphics (ie. quality and general art style remains coherent) but the design of the maps has evolved mostly because of the places we brought to. Then the general polish/quality of the maps has certainly improved in my opinion but not that much in the "this asset now has more polygons/details that a similar asset from launch" kind of way.
---
Is it possible you only looked at 1 of the starting zone when you created your character? With a new character you do not get access to only 1 starter map but to all the starter map (there is 1 per race). So maybe let's say you created a Norn but you were not phased by the general look and feel of the Norn starting zone, then maybe you might have liked the Sylvari or Charr zone better.
---
In term of general design I really like all/most of the new maps they have introduced after the core game as they feel a bit more built to tell some specific story or carry some additional context while the original maps felt like they were more here because they needed to cover some land.
---
I hope this helps you give the game another try! You could also take a look at some videos about expansion maps to get a general feel of how they evolved, maybe that could help you get a better idea.
---
Some have gotten a few Ghostlies .... some have only SEEN a few Ghostlies drop ... :'(

PvP announcement of 30.Aug 2019: You can now queue from the new mobile app and when you're home from school / work, you may found a group! :'D
---
It would be a great UI as an addon that "hardcore" players could use for more compact information,
---
But it's inferior to the vanilla UI for immersion and casual players.
---
Fuck no I'm not happy, because the game I care about has been on life support for 5 years, and everyone on this reddit thread is too afraid to hurt Anet's feelings to fucking tell them the hard truth they need to hear if they don't want gw2 to go under.
---
What exactly is a WvW core swap icon?
---
How can you guys get seriously hyped about 2 hours worth of content? Legit question..don't you think it's time for a 3rd expansion?
---
Do you play in bursts? I feel that I get far better drops after a long time of not playing. At one point I got a precursor. An ascended chest from waterlogged chests and 2 boxes from fractals after not having touched the game. I know anecdotal evidence but I always have the feeling that longer times of not playing trigger some reverse diminishing returns mechanics.
---
i like it. everything i need centered in one point
---
Firstly I don't think it's as wide spread as you think. It does happen, but to a relatively small percentage of the population. Saying it's widespread doesn't make it so.
---
I  know this sounds like a stupid suggestion but if you just spammed 1 during cut scenes, because some people have said that solved their problems. 
---
I've done more story than most people, and I've almost never had a drop out. For example I finished season 3 on more than 30 characters and I've finished the personal story on 18 characters.  The game just doesn't drop out for me.
---
I'm not saying the bug shouldn't be fixed, but I absolutely don't think this is as wide spread as you seem to think it is.
---
Haha, how much time did it take?
---
Sadly people here don't understand sarcasm or joke.
---
I play mesmer and I'd love a mesmer rework.  Let us press 1 button to give either quickness or alacrity.  Let us do a basic rotation and be top dps like DH.  Hell, unfuck what you did to chrono anet.  Needing clones to shatter is retarded.
---
Ice Effigy?
---
Looks good, some people would prefer customization over nice looks and immersion.
---
Financial situation made it so I couldn't afford a WoW sub, GW2 is free. Now I'm addicted and plan on getting the expansions ASAP.
---
1.4k LI 4 ghostlies and guildhall upgrade coins so far. Have seen dhuum chair drop multiple times as well. So its big random.
---
You say it's widespread, but I haven't be hearing anything from ~3k people via guilds. This might be an issue between you and ANet- something on the net.
---
First month of release i got abyssal black and 2 celestial whites, they were at least 50 gold, i think one even went for 200
---
WHAT DID I MISS?
---
perhaps but alot of ppl seem to be expecting anet to completely revitalize wvw/pvp/raids/etc. and make it the new focus of gw2, which is unreasonable as far as i'm concerned.
---
I'm hoping Steve will be involved with cantha if we ever get it.
---
Well hasn't it been thunderstorming in Frostgorge Sound at the Claw of Jormag since release?
---
After looking at who is in that picture, im not sure we are going to get a surprise announcement :(
---
In PvP, it's taken down from godliness but is still decent. 
---
In PvE, yeah, it's still pretty decent. Staff is very fun and axe is a liability (I've spun myself off cliffs and teleported myself under scenery) but does a lot of damage. You basically whirl around, telespam a lot then wait it out until everyone drops dead pretty much at the same time as the torment takes hold.
---
Minionmancer, it is not meta, but you asked for it.
---
Oh and this does attract other roamers when they see you! Fun is guaranteed :D
---
The Flame Legion hate the destroyers so I think it would be more likely they would align themselves with Jormag than Primordus, esp considering the charr of the Molten Alliance worked very closely with the dredge in the Wayfarer Foothills. 
---
I could see the Molten Alliance turning to the Sons of Svanir as a last ditch effort, or the major goal of a new splinter group. The Flame Legion IS conniving, they probably think they could trick Jormag.
---
Hey look it's the endurance bar from beta
---
&gt; (cough, build templates?)
---
arcdps buildtemplates, swap to full deepz power chrono or staff mirage in open world. Domi/Duel/Chrono with GS+MoP tags things like no tomorrow and can burst even most lvl80 elite mobs into dust but has fairly little sustain against unavoidable damage. Staff mirage (or staff+axe/sceptre tryhard builds) takes twice as long to put down a stray krait but can solo most bounties with fairly little effort.
---
If you still want to play boonbot as well get cheap LS3 trinkets (Bloodstone is best!), legendary gear (make sure to reskin the armour!) and just don't bother trying to keep up with the newest perfectly optimised meta build. It's enough to know the difference between the minstrel healtank and the diviner dps hybrid unless you're signing up for ERP.
---
Hey, more fluffy angry waifus for me then.
---
I was wondering if it was Anja, too. But it looks like her hair and armor is different.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Anja
---
Nice job. Not my cup of tea personally, I prefer things a bit more spread out, but I can see where some people would prefer this.
---
Wish this game has some UI customization options. We lost that with Guild Wars 1 and I was never sure why.
---
I kind of like the look of it, but you‘d definitely need to loose the arrows. 
---
They add no information and are just really confusing, because users are accustomed to having an arrow like this switch things.
---
If you need space between the skill icons, just use, you know, space ;)

**Living World Season 4 Epilogue:**
---
Braham Eirsson: Been one hell of a day, Commander. Been one hell of a life.
---
&lt;Character name&gt;: You must be proud of how Rox fought today.

Braham Eirsson: Yeah. I am.
---
Braham Eirsson: Taimi's gonna be okay, right Commander? There's no way she's gonna... I mean she can't...
---
&lt;Character name&gt;: No one knows the future, Braham. For today - just today - let's not worry about tomorrow.
---
Braham Eirsson: Love you, too.
---
Braham Eirsson: I think I'll grow my hair back.

i would go ranger and have pets take aggro/meatshield

I main a Medic Thief, full nomads with mercy runes and shadow arts traits. Annoying to enemies (tank), and my main wxp  comes from power ressing  downed allies.
---
They nerfed Shadow arts (imo) in the latest balance patch, however still fun 100%
---
She's become a prismatic dragon, not just a crystal dragon. She's been picking off all the remnant excess magic, not just Kralkatorrik's. It also brings about what the nature of magic is, and while we know it can be a limited resource, I don't think it's really ends there. I don't think she, a newly become elder dragon, would have been able to pick up all the excess magic from a specialized elder dragon with centuries of experience containing it before most of it would be able to spread through the leylines. It's possible Aurene may just act as a medium until she has offspring destined to become an elder dragon who can.

DANCE YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!!
---
* Transparent space between UI elements is the bane of my existence, F- for that! Too hard to tell where you interact with the UI and where you might be able to access in-world content beneath, plus having colourful flashes pierce through the gaps is incredibly distracting.
---
* Correct me if I'm mistaken but the white arrows added to the skill buttons do not actually serve any purpose, right? No drag/resize, no detailed stats or extra tooltips, no range or cooldown indicator.
---
* Health "bar" looks even less convenient than GW2's original circle because I can't tell whether it measures by height or surface area. Fancy orb/graphic or rectangular bar for me please
---
* The heal "button" extended below the health bar wastes space and will look absolutely atrocious with the cooldown clock overlay
---
* The profession-specific UI looks like it would be even harder to fit in all other professions, your CA bar already sticks out and good luck keeping engineer or mesmer readable.
---
* Your coloured frames will likely clash with the cooldown overlay, range indicator and possibly the "in combat" border. Plus the concept itself might have been viable at release but nowadays many skills fulfil three or more purposes and sometimes the common application does not even line up with the original intent.
---
* I do not see any provisions for the buff bar nor do you mention any improvements
---
* The bounding box looks incredibly messy. Draw any one simple geometric shape around your UI and see how little of it actually touches that border.
---
I know I tend to dislike UI changes in general but at least without playtesting I genuinely cannot find a single improvement in your design other than maybe showing the keybind for dodge rolling.
---
I believe sigil of air is actually give higher dps than force, because rene's dps is so low that 5% won't increase as much as air.
---
That is one hell of a big nut then.
---
Maybe it'll be like WoW Iron Horde... just a fodder for the launch and then the real thing appears.
---
Hopefuly not, because WoD was the worst WoW expansion.
---
Everybody: fashionable mini's (do nothing in combat, except showing where you are, if you're stealthed)
---
Ranger: permanent follower, which will fight besides you. Can be controlled a little bit.
---
Necromancer: somewhat permanent followers (minions), but if they die, you have to resummon them after a short CD on the skill. -&gt; You also have to have the skills equipped, in order have them summoned.
---
Elementalist: Elemental minions = non permanent, skill based, summoned followers.
---
Engineer: Can summon turrets, which will attack nearby enemies autonomously. They are stationary, but can be picked up and set elsewhere again.
---
Mesmer: Can constantly summon clones and phantasms of himself.
---
Thief: Has an elite skill which can summon some helping hands for a short time on a long CD
---
Renegade: Can summon some static ghosts of "legendary Charr", they will perform one abillity and then vanish again.
---
(Warrior and guardian have to crycry, because they got no skill to summon any help)
---
\-----------------
---
Asuras: In PvE they have elite skills to summon a golem (long CD; short duration)  
---
Humans: In PvE they can summon balthasars hounds as elite skill (long CD, short duration)  
---
Norn: In PvE they can summon a little worm as basic skill (medium CD, short duration)  
---
Charr: In PvE they can summon some helping hands as elite skill (long CD, short duration)  
---
Sylvari: Can either summon a sylvan hound or a druid spirit as elite skill (long CD, medium duration)
---
\------------------
---
There are also some runes, which can summon companions. A good example is "**superior rune of the ogre**". It summons a rock dog for 60s and has 60s CD. Thus basically permanent companion.
---
Thank you.  
---
Last week I started playing with my Alacrigade so this will definitely boost my learning curve
---
Twitch gameplay. So much fun.
---
I came back to the game after like a year absence and got tequatl'a hoard and 3 ascended weapon chests, 2 ascended armor boxes from WvW(all within 3-4 days). It was literally ridiculous luck. After that my drops started drying up again. I chalked it up to RNG but there definitely might be something there.
---
Well they did mostly use minstrel chrono in the erp. Diviner/zerker mix is for records or showing off to pugs that you can out dps your average low li pug 😈

---
I still hit F4 when things go wrong... 😭
---
Chrono is a shadow of its former self. Firebrand is Chaos chrono with dps.
---
Yesterday I thought it would be that engine thing that was datamined.
---
That is incorrect, air competes with impact mainly depending on 7% bonus uptime/adds. It's nowhere close to Force.
---
Looks good, but not for everyone. I wish that GW2 had UI customization, or had the ability to mod your UI, so that more compact UIs like this could be possible.
---
Have no idea why people in this subreddit are downvoting you and everyone who says they like it.
---
i hope you're using the dx12 mod
---
I meant in the ERP you might need to know when to use concentration vs. healing food, exactly which pieces to swap for zerk/commander/magi/nomad to maintain maximum EHP and Epower and it might even be worthwhile to buy a few infusions.
---
In PuGs just go full minstrel or however much diviner you can get without overcapping boon duration, even if *you* play perfectly many players have become quite skilled at dodging wells and ToT.
---
You can or could see Lightning in the Snowstorm on the Countdown Stream from Arenanet.

Some people complained about that being unrealistic.

I think sometimes people forget they are customers of a business. I find this thread a bit bizarre, it is like you are talking about a family member not a business.

If we are talking about personal attacks, then yes, don't be rude. If we are talking about being upset at any of the content announced then feel free to be as upset as you want. As a customer you should voice this.

---
I switch between heal and quickbrand. Renegade heal / qb is my preferred Combo cause qb has higher DPS and still spams aegis and i've Bad renegades that could heal through a lot of stuff. Maybe i'll give renegade a shot myself with your guide
---
Soulcleave in general is also way overrated, it is a minor dps increase.

I'll definitely do an update at end of each major release - between them, depends.

Yeah, I was hanging out regularly in the subreddit couple years back and remember him being one of the more "notorious" users around. He's just making himself look dumb tbh haha.

And LS4 couldn't push the fact that this is bad and Aurene needs to absorb the magic of Kralk if we want the world to live any more clearly.
---
As we all know, political topics had obviously never had a place in Gw2.

Well I hope not, they are quite handy for just calling events and linking waypoints together. If a Dev or Mod does see a violation I'll take down the repo of course.
---
If things change too much into different directions it can be a relief to part from each other. Always keep a place in your heart for the joyfull time you both had and let her go, for the sake of her and for the sake of you. This is a much better solution, rather than begging the gods to change things back and becoming more and more disappointed, because your prayers aren't listened at.
---
You have to allow yourslef to change, too, to stay in ballance. I wish you good luck in your futur life, hopefully you'll find your happiness again and hopefully I was able to help you find the right path.
---
Different people, different taste. Imagine we would have all the same ?
---
I agree, current UI is great and I have no desire to change it, but I also think that it would be nice to create your own UI.
---
You're the one who didn't read my answer. Playing with a ranged build is insanely easier than playing a melee one.
---
You do know the males get a skinny version too right?
---
We definitely need replacements for the other dragons.
---
There's no way Aurene can handle it all alone for too long.
---
But just having her offspring do it would be a wasted opportunity. It would be more fun to go explore the world, into previously unexplored lands, and find new friendly magical entities to replace them.
---
Remember that 3-day lockout from the guild bank and similar features for new invitees?
---
Plenty of other things went wrong too, I just thought I'd focus on just how atrocious *guild* systems have always been in a game called *Guild* Wars 2.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
I'm pushing myself so hard to believe that it was intentional but not taken and posted "accidently". I wanna believe that they are actually not THAT dumb or doesn't care about something big like this announcement THAT much.
---
Yeah I feel the same. In an ideal world, if one had to be healer and one DPS, then Quickbrand DPS / Renegade Heal is better. Quickbrand has much better DPS, and Heal Renegade's healing is oppressively over the top.
---
However, what I usually find is that if the group starts taking damage unnecessarily, and the Renegade has to outheal mechanics, then they start running out of Energy fast and alacrity uptime drops.
---
When the roles are reversed, it's so much easier for the Healbrand to do their job (maintain Quickness) and heal, and to be frank I'm starting to come around to the idea that in practice a Healbrand is a better healer than a heal renegade, simply because the aegis mitigates so many mechanics, and their ability to bring utilities like SYG!, Wall of Reflect, etc (not to mention the Tomes having massive healing, a feedback bubble, stability and resistance, etc etc)
---
Glad it's not just me.
---
&gt; actually works
---
*sometimes* works
---
FTFY
---
I dont understand why you're censoring your abilities?

Soulcleave is an extremely significant DPS increase if used correctly and depending on the fight/fight duration.

It's like giving a computer a hardware update that makes it compatible with a specific software.
---
If a normal mortal were to they the same, they would be fried by it and the magical energy would just be released again.
---
Oh I COMPLETELY forgot that was a thing. I think my mind blocked that out on purpose.
---
I dunno man, just because it's similar doesnt mean they cant have the harpoon gun have very different abilities and playstyle from the rifle. Heck I've been saying it could be cool to re-visit already existing weapons and give them a new set of five skills with an elite spec equiped; make a warrior with the fencer spec have five skills on a one-handed sword and not be.able to use an offhand - give them more evasion type attacks with high single target or something.
---
They already teased jormag being vulnerable in S4 with Braham shooting the tooth with the arrow; I doubt they'll let that sit for two LS seasons and an expansjon.
---
Well, half of what you wrote is flat-out wrong and the other half i can't be bothered to decypher. I am also not sure if you want to *give* us tips and tricks or if you're *asking* for them. Basic formatting would go a long way, man.

I'm all against paid lootboxes and most RNG in general, but what exactly is the issue as long as BLKs and buying knife tail tokens for gems **remain** completely locked out and banned? Getting one for free without the option of buying more does not "establish a precedent" or anything.
---
Then again with how wonky GW2's code is I wouldn't be surprised if implementing a vendor option on Evon including a reliable timed lock and single purchase per account limit actually turned out to be easier than showing the free gemstore offer while keeping the paid follow-up hidden.

That said, dunno if actual message macros would be different.

To be honest I think some of the mounts could work in a 10v10 format. As long as they’re done right and provide nothing beneficial except for their movement capabilities- I could see that being alright

In modern terms I'd rather call him a "literal xenophobe" than a "racist". Working-class English folk and air conditioning aren't exactly "races" and his body of work in general represents a primal fear of anything unfamiliar.

&gt; or Mod
---
Sub's mods are fine with things that are not outright malicious exploits, they just can't endorse them. "Use at your own risk."
---
Devs usually leave most things like these in perpetual gray zone because they're beneficial for everyone when used in good faith, but if they ever get misused regularly, they have freedom to act upon them.
---
An API key only gives you access to things that you give permissions to like stats for PvP, progression, wallet, builds, inventory etc AND, more importantly, ONLY to look. You will not be able to do anything really with that stuff. You can't delete or get any compromising information like passwords etc.

However, I don't know what your guild leader would want with that information because it gives only a snapshot of what your account or your inventory has right now but not the progression of things (like which items you have).
---
Which means you could be held responsible for "stealing" something from the guild just because you already have the item in your inventory or bank. So, in comparison, it is like some guy coming into your home claiming a loaf of bread was stolen and you have the same loaf of bread in your kitchen. Doesn't really say anything.
---
So, Will you be able to get hacked? You do get some information from the account which could be used for social engineering but I think it is highly unlikely because you can just delete the API key after the purpose it was used for. On the other hand, it won't really tell your guild leader who stole it unless it is such a rare item that nobody in your guild has.

who the hell are you and why does the moderator actions suddenly worry you?

I thought he was adorable. Seeing him tumble from the sky like a tired puppy, I actually felt bad about shooting his wing off.

 [Ackchyually](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ackchyually), Jormag never absorbed any of Kralk's magic. Kralk did get some of Jormag's filtered via Balth though.

It's still a showcase/preview for the people who didn't buy the pack.

I don't get it.

If she had your password, why breaking into your house ;-) ? Or it was a new level of personal, that can be a reason.
---
&gt; As long as they’re done right and provide nothing beneficial except for their movement capabilities
---
Well, for PvE where you can summon any in infinite amounts, yes. But the mount system is just too good - they're essentially vehicles, so why not make a mode around using them, just with some PvP restrictions?
---
You... you do realise im just talking about a game character in the end, right?
---
To be honest lately i have been having more fun playing white mage on ff14, but whenever a story patch is released I want to play it on my chrono, and everytime she hs grown weaket and or weirder...
---
My dad and older sister played guild wars 1, i remember watching my dad playing it and wanting to play it when it first came out but my dad said i was too young but when i was a bit older my sister let me use her acount. My best friend had it aswell and we would play it almost everyday as late has we could get away with.
---
Hm, I'll think about it. Does need some cleanup first. For Ipos ppl asked if they could buy the STL. I made it pay what you want on gumroad, but no one exceeded 0,00. Maybe will have a small price tag this time.
---
It sure worked great for wvw. 2 days of 100+ queues, a couple of months of exploiting inside objectives, 5-6 months (and counting) of skill lags, no positive impact on population.
---
Ah i see. I guess that is a third way to use it. I'm pretty sure that this comment didn't exist though when i made my first comment.
---
Could be a larger-than-usual map, and controlling certain capture points gives you access to use a "stable" nearby. You interact with the mount there and it automatically mounts you (even if in combat), but with the caveat that mount health is reduced compared to PvE (so that if you're actually in combat properly you will likely just be dismounted instantly), and mount masteries aren't a thing. Then you can use the mount to move around the map quicker - there's a crevice the mount lets you overcome, there's a few sand portals for the jackal, and a high point the bunny lets you reach in one jump. But you don't have the ability to use the mounts yourself.
---
Then we could have cool playstyles like people actually putting traps in clever spots and temporarily keeping out of sight, knowing that someone with a low-health mount might be coming through and this is your chance to get a free knockdown.
---
...LS5 might legit take 1.5 years at a 3-4 month cadence so
---
I see what you're saying. Could definitely be a mix of charr and norn.
---
Though, historically, ANet has a habit of depicting charr with wonky, fairly-humanoid proportions when simplifying them, as seen in a few loading screens. It wouldn't surprise me if it's just simplified in that way, and therefore all charr.
---
Now that's a quality meme!

=) if you play wvw, and at 12 pm onwards server time, check us out in nsp.  we're a small guild, but we do have a lot of fun.

&gt; He didn't ask us to enjoy whatever is announced,

Yes, he literally did.

"Enjoy what they will announce tomorrow. Whatever it is."

Stranger Things crossover expansion confirmed.
---
Great idea, but with Holosmith as it is already missed opportunity with holo pets. They would be easy to make, no new models just textures. That’s a shame, but we just can’t get another hologram based spec. Golems that are mimicking animals would also be cool but that might need a whole library of new models for existing pets.

You made my day :D

Found Charrs while searching for fictional fantasy races&gt; angry joe show &gt; bought

How pls share that info i cant be the only one ....
---
Most criticism is valid and delivered respectfully, you can't take one asshole's quote and paint us all the same...
---
But that doesn't have anything to do with what I'm saying. Big part of the playerbase live in their open world bubble and have zero compassion or interest for those who aren't like that, or the problems that other game modes suffer. And when people are negative about those problems and lack of Arenanet's attention, no matter how respectfully, you are met with indifference or simply told that's it's not ok to be negative.
---
I had this happen once as well. I thought it was a really low plane. Checked later and nope it was thunder in the middle of snow.
---
Did you bash your hear off your desk and then attempt to sound clever... as it really didn’t work.
---
I actually returned to playing GW2 a week or two ago as well, partly because of the upcoming announcement and really enjoying the game after a looooong time. The clear giveaway that this is LS stuff is LS logo in the original announcement, it was then brought up multiple times in the comments when people got hyped up about an expansion reveal.
---
Damn it, now I will never be able to unhear this while playing... Not that this is a particular bad thing...
---
Indeed, just wanted to show off didnt u ;) thats ok
---
Cause winter is coming?
---
&gt;but then the core crowd cried, and the mount got nerfed
---
I mean what do you do when people were jumping into objectives, immune during engages, able to stealth from from SMC to outer towers by utilising the insane speed of mounts...
---
Rather than "nerfed becuz people cried", a better description might be "nerfed because the game mode was not designed for it and was introduced with the impact on the game mostly an afterthought". Now the hype is dead and new players are finding it difficult and frustrating to have to grind a mount out while disadvantaged (or forced into dead EotM matches) in order to play the game mode, greatly increasing the barrier to entry of the game mode, while many older players left. As always, some ideas were cool, but execution was not great and half-assed, and from a medium-to-long term perspective the mount was not a very beneficial development, and many would argue it has been detrimental to the game mode.
---
If they dont announce anything good with today's announcement then no dont even try because the game will suck you in(because it is very good) and then you will have no content to do, leaving you craving for more things becoming angry and the devs. This game is like drug addiction :P
---
Such as?
---
In the last five years I tried a lot of old and new mmorpg and except for some prealpha early access ones every single game ran a million times better.
---
The last item I sold that was worth over 100g was the Fused Sword Skin which came from a Black Lion Chest, which I sold for 202g. I've had one precursor drop for me so far which was from a veteran mob in Auric Basin - The Lover. The highest amount I sold something for was probably around 500g or more for a couple of Permafrost dyes. If I was smarter with how I spent my gold I'd probably still have some. 6534 hours logged but I don't really farm and many of them are from AFK I'm sure.
---
I'm not gonna say all the lines are equal, but I will say I love that they're doing community events that are small and easy to implement and rerun. It gets people playing together. That's enough, and it's big.
---
I think they are account bound so you cant send them to other players.
---
There may be better way but I would suggest just join HP trains or bounty trains in crystal desert. You get  the experience, gold and trade contacts at the same time.
---
Are there any locations where I can find a bunch of chests close to each other? I only need 19
---
Your guild might want to reassess role abilities, and limit access to consumables to a role created specifically for a small group of trusted WvW commanders. That guild siege is really expensive, and represents a lot of donations and/or scribing. I don’t blame your leader for wanting answers ASAP.
---
Okay! Thanks!
---
Ok thx!
---
Thanks!
---
&gt; Gonna give no info on how I know this
---
**No trustable sources**: first symptoms of fake news.
---
Also, I started reading with a "joke ahead" warning on mind, confirmed it at the very first paragraphs :D
---
Go raid the Tomb of the Primeval Kings on a few characters, there are a few chests in there that drop trade contracts. IIRC this was (and maybe still is?) one of the top contract farming spots.
---
when you have alts, go to the tomb of primeval kings in the north west corner of the desert higlands. there like 8 chests that you can open daily with every char that give trade contracts. also when you have the jackal, park one of your alts at the end of the jackal JP in the crystal oasis. there are 3 big chests you can open daily, but only once per account!
---
French fries, motherfucker
---
Indeed. Though, I won't fault people for that. It's appreciated that people try not to use the portal if they don't have to, as it has  twenty person limit before closing.
---
Well, I mean, the prevailing theory is that taking the eagles was Gandalf's actual plan (based on the route they were taking among other things) but since he didn't want anyone to get wind of it he played it close to his chest, thus when he told them to "fly, you fools" (don't remember if that wording is exact) he was trying to clue them in to his plan not just telling them to run away, they just didn't understand.

The executables really shouldn't be in the repo. You can use the [release feature](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) for them.

LOOK, LOOK WITH YOUR SPECIAL EYES!

You are not prepared.
---
Individual icebrood charr aren't really unlikely. It's the "Flame Legion turn to worshipping Jormag" that's unlikely as the core lore for the Flamr Legion is that after failing to turn destroyers into idols of worship they focused on making a god instead of finding one (hence Gaheron and the Eternal Flame that got tucked away in a corner).
---
Though I don't expect to see icebrood charr for the same reason we never saw branded asura or branded norn in S4 unless it becomes a plot focus like the branded dredge and branded awakened.
---
This kind of stuff is really cool and is a great way to build hype. 
---
Kind of reminds me of the holiday streams OW has with Jeff just sitting there for hours. Not much actually happening on screen but people still watch to see what comes next.
---
If nothing else, the one thing anet always does right is their fucking beautiful artwork.
---
Imagine if like 5 minutes before the live stream, I giant tidal wave sweeps in washing all them away and all that's left on screen is a Largos holding out an aquabreather for you to take.
---
Cool, looks pretty blocky tho, could use some smoothing, did you get this from the game or modeled it yourself?
---
At least one of his champions.
---
I don't know but it seems to be pretty low.
---
Since August 2012 I never dropped a single precursor and inside raids I probably dropped a couple named weapons but that's it. One of my old guildmates used to drop the ghostly infusion every week.
---
Interesting! The way they are hyping this...I like it. Just adding more ice legion charrs there and the eyes of jormy :)
---
Queue the GoT theme....hopefully ANet enlists the same production house that did the opening GoT sequences?
---
Top center of the image you can see some blue glowie blobs... assuming these can be eyes I guess 👀
---
Kalla brings a lot of extra sustain and helps substantially with scholar uptime, it's impact on actual gameplay can be substantial.
---
I've seen thundersnow once -- I was outside at the time and there was pretty heavy snow cover everywhere. Damn near had a heart attack when lightning struck and I was suddenly blinded by the light reflecting off of the clouds and snow. (I was especially caught off guard since there hadn't been any thunder until then -- and no thunder after, either.)
---
Thankfully I was only about ten feet from my house's door, so I just stumbled back inside. &lt;_&lt;
---
And music.
---
&gt; Soulcleave is an extremely significant DPS increase

I want to go over the Shiverpeaks into Cantha, Himalayas style. Cannot WAIT for the announcement!!
---
We are in the endgame now.
---
That power creep is felt the most in WvW, they should give everyone a 5% health buff in the mists. Dodging and having proper support classes to back you up helps but it's really not fun.
---
looks like an angler fish
---
Either way, I'm holding on to my [shadowstone](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reforged_Shadowstone). It's got enough power in it to fulfil the energy needs a small city by now. By the time I'm ready to retire from destroying eldrich gods, I can sell it to whatever is left of Rata Sum for a small fortune.
---
I live in a hot desert climate (Phoenix), so I'm happy to visit chilly places.  But yeah, particle effects needed to properly render snowfall have, historically, brought even the beefiest gaming rigs to 5fps.

Unlimited powaaaaah
---
They appear every 10 seconds or so
---
Has anyone tested the "gain health every second" food? How much healing per second?
---
It makes sense. Destinys edge started with Jormag...
---
Fallout did it too with a Vault Boy figure and little easter eggs, tucking him underablanket overnight, etc. ofc this lead to fo76, but the 24hr hype stream was neat.
---
I expect 45 minutes of LS5 marketing and literally nothing more.
---
I hate you.  Unless all new raids are exclusively underwater as well!!  /s
---
rifle deadeye it is, then

You forgot an arm. You need to add one that is talking about us?

Oooonslaught, im old.
---
I've seen it once in my life myself. Was on a highway at night and it definitely surprised me.
---
Read the last bit. Check out snowcrows for raids. Discretize for fotm.
---
how silly, you twisted the reddit symbol with the arenanet logo!
---
3rd expansion
---
Some players feeling left out really isn't the biggest problem with this. Imo, the issue is that some elite specs being available while others aren't could have massive implications for game balance. Important counters might be unavailable at the wrong times, and the whole meta could shift drastically each time they released a new one.
---
I'm actually optimistic that new elite specs could be coming, but I think they have to be all or nothing.
---
i just wish raiders and fractal goers gonna get have some fun as well in season 5, we are kinda starving for attention from anet...
---
Lets not talk about WvW or sPvP.
---
Are you clicking auto attack with your mouse?
---
That's why we bought the game; can't have cooler enemies than dragons
---
I expect them to talk for 45 minutes about the first episode of season 5. Everything beyond that is a bonus.
---
It's cheap heat to make them more despicable. Which reminds me, I got actioned on the main forums for calling Svanir incels. XD
---
Hi old 'trying to return' player here. 
---
So i have the base game(but i cant remember the password and now waitin for a response.)
---
anyways here is my question, is hearth of the thrones included to my old accaount (you know like how wow adds all the expansions to the base game and asks you to buy just the last expension)
---
im thinkin to buy path of fire and with the spead of their customer support, i might wait for like 2 weeks. and i can get a free new accaount and buy the path of fire and skip the waiting part.
---
Wtf is that picture.
---
Literally everyone wants anet attention... Except the fashion community, they are good with the constant fliow of gem store stuff.
---
-Expansion  
---
-Guild Wars 3

---
They already said that w7 is the last PoF raid and there's still at least 7-8 more months for 1 year release rate :\^)
---
Please no. LW episodes already take a long time to release. If we do that, we'll never season the end of Season 5.
---
Been away the last couple months on summer vacation. Will get back on track next week :D
---
Kralkatorrik fought a rather huge amount of norn and asura in the Pact army. And caused devastating losses to them before Dragonfall. No reasob plotwise for them not to show.
---
Lack of models was no doubt cost. Though could have been because they forgot too, since they could have cheaper out and used the crystal infusion + 9 stacks of thr branded impairment thing that adds crystals across the body. Or did like they did with branded thralls in S4E1 that never appeared again: use risen models with a purple hue color change and purple mist.
---
The lack of returning branded thralls is no doubt forgetfulness.
---
Anyone else hoping this leads to a massive assault on Hoelbrak in episode 1.
---
It's supposed to be blocky :/  I go the model file on thingiverse.
---
It's nice is what that is.
---
They would still want more attention from anet. So you were right the first time, everyone wants anet's attention this next season/expansion/whatevermabob.
---
Big Announcement:
---
Wintersday 10.12-21.1.
---
my HOPES for pve since I don't play pvp, new (elite) spec(s), new skill(s), new raid(s)/fractal(s) every episode either one of these would be great
---
Firebrand can do all of what you mentioned there on it's DPS builds aswell.
---
Well, we solved it boys. Case closed.
---
I'm actually sorry if that hurt you, I didn't mean to bash you for creating this. As I stated: It's absolutely valid if this is your ideal UI layout and if there was a way to customize the UI and yours this way that would be great. 
---
For me personally however it would feel horrendous to play with it, that was what the other part of my comment was about. I might have wrongly inferred that a mockup like this paired with your expressed enthusiasm for it would imply a suggestions of sorts that getting this as a layout(option) would be a good idea.
---
Inb4 shadowstone morphing into dragonball.
---
And empty hype
---
Ease is irrelevant to my point.
---
Would be easy enough to make a large one for that purpose. This little guy is fairly small though :).
---
Can I just point out Anet may be the first company I've seen who has over 4,000 people watching a bloody countdown. Also looks like Jormags awake.
---
Drakkar could be a good shout. They know the hardcore community need stuff to do.
---
4,5k people watching a countdown stream on guildwars 2's twitch page, 3k~ people not counting bots watching the raid tournament, totally a dead game :^)

Ahh welcome to The Eye of the North. That’s likely Jormag’s champion, Drakkar.
---
I think most people don't expect more. But the question is: what will they market LS5 with, no? And even thought I'm kind of at a loss what a Legendary Meta Event is supposed to be (one with a Legendary boss? Just a great one in vein of the HoT metas? Somethign akin to TT?) this could be a thing to market LS5 with. (E.g.: &gt;&gt;Season 5 bringing grander and more elaborate metaevents…&lt;&lt;)
---
Some people or one guy? Cause I haven't seen anyone complaining about that but sure.
---
4,5k people watching a countdown stream on guildwars 2's twitch page, 3k~ people not counting bots watching the raid tournament, totally a dead game :)
---
Does lifesteal food trigger on vampiric aura?
---
Well new elite specs and new skills go hand in hand. New raids I agree and I think will be more frequent I think they'll want to show they can go raid, fractal, raid, fractal. We know a fractal is highly likely as they have been coming out every second release with the last one with All or Nothing. I wonder what it will be. I would love a fractal based on the the Thunderhead Keep mission from GW1.
---
legendary meta event? the fuq?
---
Your expectations is they won't talk about the thing they said they are going to talk about.
---
Jormag always had lightning in snowstorm powers. Just go to Drakkar Spurs and watch lightning pop around the ice along the northern end.
---
@ Edit: Well, I just could say "don't judge an entire world based on small groups or single individuals". There are still a lot of nice and helpful people in this community.
---
Facts
---
i dun wahnit. literally. i don't want another dragon story :(
---
That's just a foolish fan theory from people who've never read the books. There's a whole host of reasons why they don't fly the ring. While they're not quite maiar like Gandalf, they're still high-level beings that can be corrupted. The mission to Mordor was also intended to be one of stealth, which is why Glorfindel also didn't go with the fellowship, despite being probably the greatest elf warrior alive and one of the greatest elf warriors in general, singlehandedly killing a balrog (he died too and then came back, but yea he still killed one by himself).
---
You most likely would be antispam suspended before you get in the land of bot-like behavior. In the last year commanding squads became literally impossible through chat without several people pinging, because commander becomes suspended hard from pinging objectives and waypoints.
---
Christ, you people... These types of images should NEVER be shared...
---
..without sauce?  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Yeah that's still just circumventing the lack of some basic game feature.
---
[](https://m.twitch.tv/guildwars2)
---
Their argument for sexism is that *Sons* of Svanir are all male (oh shit, who would have guessed). So to bring a woman into play just for equality and not for quality I just made Jormag female.
---
Does anyone know of a good source that will be posting the meat and potatoes from the stream live? In text preferably, stuck at work!
---
Well aren't Gods just poverfull, magic-infused beings? Is there something specific that makes them divine?
---
Its fine with me as long as we can drink VB LONG necks ingame
---
It is, but doing so does not rely on ANet doing anything other than not deleting guilds.
---
Just host GW2.
---
I live in Idaho.  I've been on a mountain skiing at night and had it thundersnow.  A lot more intense than when you're down in the valley and you have a thundersnow.
---
I think we will see specifics yet, but so far we were lead to believe that Aurene is the key to contain it.
---
Also it got a lot of press on different sites because of that reason. I don't think this live stream in particular got much press outside of those already regularly playing.
---
Holo forge uses a sword to blast light at his enemies, why shoudnt that same forge be used to blast light from a shield at enemies?
---
Girls are icky! G.R.O.S.S.
---
Yeah, it was nice.
---
There probably will be a post on here a few hours after.
---
Back in GW1, before anyone even knew about Primordus, the Flame Legion briefly tried to use the Destroyers and The Great Destroyer as replacement gods for the Titans. I don't remember how it ended, but I think it was mostly due to the Destroyers disinterest in keeping worshipers and wanting to kill the Charr too.
---
Meanwhile, despite being of the opposite element, Jormag is an eldritch, godlike entity that has been shown to be VERY keen on gathering worshipers and empowering them. So it kind of makes sense for the Flame Legion to turn to Jormag in their desperation.
---
On a somewhat unrelated note, do the hits from Vampiric aura count as hits for Virtue of Justice passive?
---
I think it'll beat out the ERP easily the viewers are slowly climbing but over 100k is highly unlikely. Maybe if they do something crazy and unlikely like New Race with living world season 5 it may get people in.
---
Nice :)
---
The only situation I can think of where hps food is stronger than lifesteal food is for Druids. The extra bit of astral force is still good.
---
I was sleeping and it woke me up, so yeah, yours was a lot more intense.
---
What you mean? I just want to know if i can Live React to this on my own channel (im hosting atm anyways)
---
not saying it is impossible but don't you think that you have two elite specs pretty much behave the same?! Why would a new elite spec which gives you access to the shield in the main-hand offer the same mechanic as an already existing elite spec?!
---
Imagine if there's a big twist in that Jormag turns out to be female
---
You can, people did that with HoT and PoF announcements.
---
[Indeed](https://i.imgur.com/rrdib5g.png)
---
This won't end well.
---
All I can guess is that the game is trying to run of the integrated graphics and not the radeon GPU, maybe you can open resource monitor and and the game and check what GPU it's trying to run of. 
---
Not used OSX for years so not sure if you can monitor it resource monitor.
---
Expectation: Half of reddit to be filled with excitement and the other half to be filled with disappointment, resulting in a ever deepening state of resentment and resulting in utter chaos.
---
While it could be Jormag, I have a different thought. The eyes belong to Drakkar. Three reasons for this thought:
---
1. They're too short. Jormag is an Elder Dragon and would make those at the bottom be like ants.
---
2. Jormag should still be recovering from the events of S3. It is also an ideal chance for Anet to show of Jormag "rising again" and not just have that happen off screen.
---
3. Drakkar is the #1 champion who would rally an army to raise Jormag (see #2), and is the technical founder of the Sons of Svanir.
---
I'm not figuring elites would come in the first episode actually, I'm expecting them to be announced as coming in the 2nd/3rd episode after we get into the storyline. They would be in a teaser video during the event, with "more details to follow after the first episode is released".
---
I agree, I think the point is that you set high expectations because the alternative is not committing more time into the franchise. As in, yes it is very unlikely they will talk about PvE/Raid schedule or WvW balance changes, new set of Elite Specs/etc. But the default position is that: if they announce what they said they'd announce, I wouldn't be disappointed but I wouldn't be excited either. If they do sprinkle in something extra then I would be especially engaged and my interest in the game would continue.
---
Otherwise, it is a good point in the expansion lifecycle to move on, hoping that the game community (particularly in marginal areas like Competitive modes) sticks around long enough that those areas will see attention and bring new exciting things to draw players who enjoy those modes of play back.
---
Because GW2 uses one big server cluster per region (instead of multiple servers / clusters per region like other MMOs such as FFXIV), almost every map is fairly populated with people at any one time. The server names you see when you create a character really only matter for World vs World tribalism.
---
As for content to be dropped this week, that’s doubtful - Anet will be announcing stuff today, but the release of Episode 1 of Living Story 5 is probably at least a month or so away. And honestly, from Anet’s perspective, I would let WoW Classic suck some of the oxygen out of the room for a month before dropping anything major the week it comes out anyway.
---
I did pointed that out tho .. I said veterans can do just as well with melee classes in open world, hence for them it doesn't really matter, but for newbies ranged is gonna be much more forgiving.
---
Interesting. Thanks. I haven't got the skill points for any of those but I'll look in to them.
---
The lightning thing gets me every time. AND LET US KNOW FORGET "Is this new music"
---
You sure? I know GW2 Partners can, but im just a random little streamer
---
RemindMe! 3.5 hours

Dsd?
---
**Living World**
---
I suspect that they will try to change the way they design LS maps. No more collections/meta events, but territorial battles between us and the Ice Legion (kinda like Kurzick vs. Luxon). The story will be a crazy setup like Jessica Price talked about but no idea how that is going to turn out.
---
**PvP/WvW**
---
Swiss Tournaments and maybe better 2vs2 support? Alliance system for WvW. I don't expect surprises here.
---
**Fractal/Raid**
---
Mostly the same as LS4. No Fractal CMs and raids every 9-12 months. To my surprise W8 was actually confirmed by a game dev. Quality will be lower than previous content since key people that was working for this area have left the company.
---
**Etc.**
---
Build templates. I hope they will announce new Elite specs but I really doubt it.

Just don't listen to trolls.
---
You have years of content ahead, expansions are amazing and currently we are riding hype train because in about 2h we are getting huge live streamed announcement of new features. 
---
Game is in its best starte since ever. Every month we are getting some kind of bigger updates. Recently we got new pvp maps, legendary runes, enhanced cooking with small side quest and community events.
---
Also, game feels full, there is always a lot of people online, I see lots of groups on LFG, new maps, endgame pve. PvP queues are like 1 minute recently, so very good.
---
Ugh I have to wait until I get off of work to watch it :/

If there's any bingo on here that even has a chance of happening, it's the top row. That said, each bingo is more or less equally unlikely.

I would wait a few hours as the expansions might go on sale after the announcement.
---
People are predicting the next release to be September 17th, but we'll probably know for sure in about 2 hours.
---
Pretty much this.
---
also i really hope something WvW related, i mean the new cooking makes abolutely no sense at all outside of WvW, its like its meant to be for WvW only.
---
You know, tbh, that's not so bad of a story for why they hate women. Utterly shallow etc, but it does take a weak mind to so easily have their will bended. Makes sense.
---
Though you'd probably play the outgoing heal food on Druid
---
they are called kitten.
---
 -10% incoming dmg
---
Most lifesteal does not count for things such as that.
---
looks like a good boi
---
Maybe on WvW roaming then
---
Deep Sea Dragon.
---
Room temperature legion just wasn’t catchy
---
First, I didn't belive you with that dev claim, my bad.
---
Second, hard to say if it wasn't meant as what is guild wars about "now"?
---
Then the dragons answer would mean nothing.
---
I would really love to see some kind of charr warband that from the day one seems like a fighters of good. But in the middle of season we would realize how we were taking part in genocide.
---
Yeah, I don't like dragons so I hoped you are wrong.. And still hoping..
---
The meta events in PoF give [chests](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hero%27s_Choice_Chest) in which you can choose 100 trade contracts as a reward.
---
&gt;Water is my weaknes and i would love feedback and tips since i hate using water i find it weak and annoying to be honest, the heals are weak and the dps is non existant. 
---
Yes, the dps is bad. The heals are only bad if you're built for damage. If you're built for heals, they're great. But building for heals significantly reduces your damage output, so unless you're in group content that specifically wants a healer(not all group content does), then it's a waste.

&gt;I need advice for fractals and raids aswell since i have yet to be successful in either with my ele

https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/tempest/power/
---
I dunno, the ones I've seen explaining the theory go pretty deep into stuff you don't know without the books and appendices, so "That's just a foolish fan theory from people who've never read the books." is a pretty arseholish statement tbh.
---
WvW.
---
I find that the population is pretty good as far as getting most necessary events done. While GW2 probably isn't thriving as much as it once did, it's pretty healthy for a 7 yr old game :)
---
Yeah tested. Was gearing condi guard for zerg, and a combo with Hammer of Wisdom, Glacial Heart and Sigil of Draining seemed interesting
---
Dont play on macOS. TRUST ME. 
---
The only way is doing a bootcamp to get a fair performance, else buy a laptop/computer for games. 
---
What I did when i had not money, was to get an external SSD with typeC, install a Windows To Go and the bootcamp drivers, so I could play. 
---
Btw, i just could get 40fps on lowest 1024 resolution, fyi. WvW made the computer go for 85ºC, raids more or less.
---
School supplies, motherfucker
---
Scarlett is not what I'd consider a minion.
---
when did the dev confirmed w8?
---
I seem to remember there being even more arguing and more downvoting. Anything with 200 points was like the biggest post of the quarter.
---
I'm not saying this was the result of memes/no-memes. I'm saying that "nice" is not how I would describe that period of time.
---
Except for the entire legal system, lel. Innocent until proven guilty, "dude".

I will always upvote this bird meme

More the sons of svanir but the whole thing felt like a tumblr power fantasy.
---
There must always be a Jormag.
---
10/10 would pat.
---
Oh right
---
Steal like is not only healing, the health you steal has to be considered as damage too.
---
I said the posts are frequent, unlike you I didn't claim anything about the actual amount of occurences. that's my whole point, we can't possibly now, and I fully admit that. you however start throwing out numbers and make assumptions when realistically, you have no idea either, you just don't question your assumptions at all and want to be right for some reason.
---
and since you've now start another claim, let's just look at reddit:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search/?q=disconnect&amp;restrict_sr=1
---
you can easily tell from the title which ones are talking about this problem. now say again how very few of these posts there even are. 
---
seriously, what IS your motivation for trying (with exaggerations and simply wrong information) to downplay this problem?
---
It's healthy. Has plenty to do. A lot of people.
---
I guess it's mildly arbitrary as to what constitutes as a 'significant dps increase'. It's definitely more than the 1k that is claimed, depending on your comp it's closer to 2x-3x that outside like uber short instant burst bosses. I consider a 3k buff to be fairly significant when it also basically makes doing no healer completely braindead even for the worst of squads. Though I guess compared to something like OWP in fractals it isn't nearly as crazy.
---
I'd love to see WvW attention too, I just can't see it as being a focus after the layoffs. New elites might change some of the meta, but all I can imagine will happen are a few more warclaw skins and a few more cosmetics. I'd really like to see the warclaw get some adjustments (like make it easier to be dismounted / add more of a tradeoff for it) at the very least. Making Edge of the Mists more than a ghost town would be great as well. Making Obsidian Sanctum more than just an easy port to LA would be nice too.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/guildwars2 In less then two hours you will have the answers to your questions :)

Celestial staff staff mirage. With some heal. The skill that changes boons in conditions, the player-clone place swap thingy and cleans mantra I think.

well, that is not much considering that a Certain WoW streamer has currently 57K people watching.

what I wanna know is what is the best seed to plant for 1-DPS, 2-Healing and 3-condi
---
What's your motivation for upplaying this problem. You're throwing around this idea that it's frequent. And for you it might be. But that doesn't mean it's widespread. If it was, we'd have heard a lot more about it.  
---
This community is many things, but one thing it's not is shy about complaining about stuff. There have been some complaints, sure. But if it was widespread, there's have been mob and pitchforks. 
---
  
---
I'm not saying it shouldn't be fixed. I'm saying that it's probably not as frequent as some people seem to think it is. And that's ALL I'm saying.
---
Why not?
---
WOOT
---
Yeah I'm expecting the same, good numbers but not breaking HoT records. Even if they announce something huge like a new race, I think the stream would still not break the record (takes a while for people to hear the news on stream and then start spreading it on other sites) but post-stream would be absolute chaos.
---
Trash devs.
---
That's awesome!
---
now there are eyes visible over the marching army
---
Where in WvW does it actually matter though? Last I heard Epidemic still kills you more or less instantly and most other condi sources are handled via group cleanse. Why would they even care about WvW in this fringe context instead of offering e.g. endurance regen, incoming or outgoing CC duration, movement speed or other non-dps-centric mechanics?
---
there are glittering blue eyes over the marching army now
---
Because you can't be a holo and the spec that equips mainhand shield at the same time?
---
And it would be super lame if a new engi spec was just Holosmith with shields, that's not original at all .\_.
---
1-Cilantro 2-Mint 3-Cilantro (for high crit chance builds) or Peppercorn
---
No actually not you.  Because **Rise!** is a Reaper-only shout that summons 1+x minions, depending on how many targets you hit.  I think 5 or 6 is the cap.
---
You're essentially advertising the game. So I dont think Anet has anything against you streaming and reacting to the announcement
---
Reporting in an hour and a half before the stream goes life to tell you that there are *definitely* Charr in this image. The central character is a Charr, immediately to the right as you look is a Charr that's hunched down, *above* that one also looks like either a Charr or some kind of icebrood Minotaur, there are other figures on the left that have horns fairly distinctive to Charr instead of typical heavy-armour Norn helmets...
---
It might not be Frost Legion, but you're flat out wrong - there are *definitely* Charr in this image.
---
I just finished gearing my Alacrigade and have been very cautiously trying it out in fractals, so this guide comes at just the right time for me! This is quite different from the Metabattle/Snowcrow Build I've used so far, mainly because I didn't even know you were supposed to use F2 for Might. Oopsie. So far I've been struggling a little with energy management and personal DPS but at least was able to keep up Alacrity at all times. I've only ever played power Soulbeast, so actually learning a new class is harder than I expected lol. Thanks for the guide, it was very helpful!
---
I'm not upplaying it. I'm saying it's an existing problem which people have been reporting for a long time. I don't make claims about how often it occurs, except for the amount of posts, and I already linked the reason for that statement. I'm trying factually arguing against your unfair and biased opinions stated as fact. but obviously you're not interested in honest arguments, or you wouldn't keep making claims without any backing.
---
They certainly have never been the strongest aspect of their storytelling. I have to wonder what the writers at Anet even I nini a politically driven story should be, because it seems like every time they attempt one it gets 100% totally resolved within the same episode. Political thrillers are supposed to be one step forward, two steps back dynamics, where you make slight progress but your underhanded opponent’s are always ahead of you.
---
If you _do_ buy the expansions, wait an hour and a half for them to go on sale.     
---
As far as content, we will find out later again in about an hour and half.
---
Thank you for the guide! Now I have no excuse to not play my fully ascended alacrigade
---
I'm usually going through about 2 to 3 liters myself.
---
nike is a saint
---
so glad hes still around after all these years despite all the low info people who complain about him on this reddit
---
Depends what you want, fractals, raids, etc. I'm not a huge fractal player since the rework so I'm not going to be producing any meaningful CM logs. But in Raids on something like MO https://dps.report/Kc6y-20190820-215616_mo you can see it pulling ~2.1k with a low attack rate group. (just a random log I had laying around)
---
Would have been curious to see, but looks like I am too late
---
Sort of a "look we gave it to you now leave us alone" type deal?
---
Thanks, but my original remark was primarily aimed at the regen effect. Why does *that* exist when the damage reduction seems to be far better in virtually every scenario?
---
Thundersnow, Lightning Strike, Holy Smooookes - totally lit up the sky...
---
Yep, now I'm hyped! Here's to hoping it's good and we get some good content in the future!
---
Expansions are alright, but since there's a good possibility they go on sale very soon, I'd wait for that. If you get into end-game content, (fractals, raids, even competitive pvp) you will be severely limiting yourself by not owning an expansion. I actually can't think of a meta build right now (at least for fractals/raids) where you can get away with using a core profession (excluding Revenant) and core gear stats. (Core BS Warrior, maybe?) I'm sure someone will be able to correct me if I've forgotten something, though.
---
As far as the health/future of the game is concerned, check here again in around 1.5 hours.
---
Which would go completely against the whole point of the skills.
---
They don't WANT to have a situation where you "need" to be a specific race to be optimal, and even a small buff will be enough to "force" people into using that race.
---
I don't think that's true that theorycrafters don't partake in it... theorycrafting has always been the domain of hardcore and semi-hc players, not the casual fractal cm/raid players who generally get worse results playing without healers than when they do.
---
It is to be noted that assuming perfect fractal gameplay from most people is a fallacy, I even doubt your own fractal runs are that perfect all the time, because that doesn't happen that everything is always 100% perfect, and it ignores that in many fractal fights it's not actually the boss itself that's dangerous. Stunning them won't remove their adds, the only bosses it rings true for are Skorvald, Arkk, and Enso.
---
&gt;it's all just generic reddit chit-chat, so i just lol it. same like "healbrand is meta healer"
---
But this is true for pugs, pretty much. You can malign it all you want, that doesn't make it not true for them. The very fact that they're pugs you often don't know is reason enough: why waste your time on potential failure with players you don't know the skill level of when it can be done far faster with a safe and reliable set up? Pugs aren't the audience of this theorycrafting and *never have been*, so I don't know where this delusion that pugs should always run the exact meta setup comes from, it isn't true for raids, it isn't true here, and even hc groups have disagreements on what the meta setup should be for raids. Even then there are micro-differences in what to run for fractals and the 'optimal' DPS for each boss changes, furthermore with instabilities, but most people can't be bothered to change just for a single boss within a fractal. 
---
Theoretically, these heal-groups might be capable of it, but who can be bothered to find out? And furthermore their players might not be comfortable with it and there's no better way to guarantee failure than to force players to do a strategy they do not want to do. In their own time, when their confidence is enough, then they get comfortable and express the desire to try it. Every player that I do know that does the standard actual meta comp for fracs without a healer did not start that they, they got comfortable with heals until they were confident enough to try it without. It's not an "ugh pugs" thing but in my experience an important stepping stone towards the ideal comp for most. You can't make a high-end player in an instant, you need to let them get to that level on their own.
---
Yesterday I helped out a low Li W1 run (maybe 50 Li) and then soon after me 4 guys from LN joined too. Was fun to play with them. But that’s in EU.
---
they will do living story season 5 but its "like and expansion" so we will get elite specs and stuff, maybe with a "battle pass" like purchase system. new masteries, etc. its basically like an expansion but its in the typical living world format where every 2-3 months we get another bit of the expansion
---
Ugh, what was the one where you had to connect power nodes to the enemy core and take it out? Was that Onsalught? It's been so long, but that mode was so fun...
---
Still waiting until the ideal fractal comp inevitably becomes 4 DHs prestacking FMW with one alacrigade
---
Is seems like the theory that these are charr (most likely from the Blood Legion territories) is the most probable.
---
Hey, I think this is a recurrent question but I left 1y ago, were there important changes since ?
---
*checks map*

Holup
---
Only the other twelve million post we get daily. But it's okay
---
This thread is interesting. Op doesn't necessarily convey their own feelings. It's interesting to read people's take on this. I for one don't think it's bad that they hate women. It makes them more cultish and easily puts them on or enemy list. 
---
Politics and religion will ALWAYS have a place in media and art. It's how the world has always been. The audience's reaction is what makes things interesting. I'm hoping for the best during the announcement today.
---
Thanks nagennif, correct I’ve played MMOs where when you get to certain spots in the game trying to level or kill bosses higher levels dominate the area making it a true chore. Or Kill you.
---
I don't get it
---
What weapons do you use?
---
You just proofed one of my previous statements
---
&gt; **It is good to use when you have extra energy to spare** and dont have to upkeep it for too long, **but not that amazing when you're already short on energ**y.
---
In raids you dont have to spam your f2 all the time for might and cc.
---
In raids you can keep it up as an extra without sacrificing anything else.
---
Also i thought this was a fractal discussion mostly, but whatever.
---
It's only been, lessee... *a full year* since they said they wouldn't be doing an expansion. I can understand why you'd be surprised. Talk about suddenly dropping a bombshell about a new living world like this!
---
Just hug the wall to the right (by the spider cave entrance).  You can even get there with raptor long jump from that little mound.
---
We've known they were going into season 5 next for a long time.
---
Currently 10.6k though :)
---
it won’t let me buy them they are all locked
---
i still disagree with your statement, it's a rather low dps increase, not "extremely significant" surely it's higher on a dps golem raid boss where you don't cc or use burst skills but even then rather insignificant. imagine 2 players just being a bit better and doing 1k dps more, you wouldn't even notice.
---
OK thanks, ill try
---
&gt;  Game's logo is a dragon
---
It's also literally Jormag from the original trailer.
---
WWW Alliances is there!  Just look again, the center square...
---
I want, no I NEED this as a background. ANET PLS
---
Only in the most general of concepts. The icebrood and destroyers act very differently and I doubt we'd be doing the "gather the many races as allies" plot again.
---
One can argue the personal story is a redux of the EotN plot with how we focus on gathering together the races. Or S4 with how we gather the Elonian forces.
---
But ANet basifally did a redux of Nightfall through Path of Fire so I wouldn't put it past them.
---
How can an entire month pass without you knowing its a living world stream when literally the first post about it said LIVING WORLD. Like, you people must be half blind or doing it on purpose.
---
Just turn off the chat while you watch, it's pretty bad.
---
Thanks !

I don't think any 'karma farmers' use this subreddit for 'farming'. Basically everything in new gets downvoted once or twice within seconds of posting regardless of what it is.
---
Why anyone would farm karma in the first place is beyond me.
---
I get why you might think that's what I'm trying to do here, but it's more like '/r/therewasanattempt to give useful info.' I was a bit too slow for it to be anything more than an attempt, though. Probably let the excitement get the better of me a little bit.
---
I'm so glad I don't have your brain.
---
They never announced an expansion that far ahead...HoT was announced at the end of Season 2, PoF at the end of Season 3. ANET has never teased any long term plans in the past.
---
They've never said that they wouldn't be doing another expansion, they just said that Living story 5 was next.
---
You can beta it on Android presently, so not sure about that one.
---
WE GOIN ~~west~~ NORTH
---
That and the Fort Concordia instance prior to Fort Trinity. At this point I have seen the cutscenes so many times from having to restart that I skip all cutscenes in that instance.
---
There is no assurance one way or the other.
---
But we've known for a while that following Season 4 will be another LW season. If an expansion is in the works it'll be post S5.
---
&gt;	Yup payable quaggan inc
---
Quaggans, just like accounts...are now *payable!*
---
Tyria is a dragon
---
BDO and it looks way better
---
Inquest and Nightmare Court are more interesting, but I think the point is that the good version of each villain faction is the main player ones. Iron, Blood and Ash are sorta representing that more peaceful and innovative aspect, while the other Norn lodges are somewhat equel to the Svanir. Though Svanir is probably the weakest of the bunch, with their relationship to the main Norn populace being kinda vague and contradicting.
---
&gt;  i dont think they wont do it for this one
---
They don't have to do anything. Twitch just does that, unless the channel specifically turns it off.
---
Fun fact: based on the silhouette from the norn intro, the dragon totem, and the Sons of Svanir emblem, Jormag's head closely resembles the GW2 logo dragon's head.
---
Jormag *is* the Guild Wars 2.
---
Why are ''veterans''(lol at that term btw) so whiny?
---
Honestly I think it would be cool if Living World season 5 was about finding a replacement for Jormag. Maybe a hunt for Drakar so we can purify him like Glint
---
Is "season 5" its last name then?
---
Is that what you think? The pale tree is a minion of Glint? Did I miss some lore somewhere?
---
Then they'd be worse at naming things than Nintendo, and I don't think that's possible.
---
Only way I'd stick around for a GW3 is if they said they were bringing GW1 style skills back. But there's not a chance in hell they'll announce GW3.
---
Made me (an almost seven year vet) stop playing WvW altogether I hated it so much along with causing me to essentially take a break from the game as a whole too
---
More like dead world haha am i right fellas xDDD thanks for the gold
---
You face is funny, it's like a little raisin, motherfucker.
---
Toothless b/c Jormag lost its tooth to the Norn lol
---
At the time of posting, there was no dragon in the image.
---
But girls are smelly! Ugh!
---
*-Strongbro Strongefist, champion of Jormag.*
---
That's cause they're better at stealing your heart &lt;/3.
---
Everything we k or about you guys.. is wrong! *reaches out hand*
---
*dies in ice storm immediately*
---
Gotta agree. Politics in gaming are toxic, and will bring no good in any way whatsoever. We already trod on thin ice with PoF's refugees and ~~Trump's~~ Joko's wall, right when those topics were a huge mountain of fuel for drama and controversies.
---
And still, the sexist ideologies of those two factions never made any sense whatsoever. Serious villains shouldn't behave like immature children, it ruins them as a whole.
---
That's just begging for confusion down the line, not happening.
---
Also that would be lame ass expansion name.
---
Interesting.  So it might just have been pulled off of higher tier nodes.
---
Well back then I imagine they still had the team working on other projects as well. Now when GW2 is all they have one might think things have changed (priorities to keep company going).
---
What’s this!?
---
Yo! Mind spoiling what’s in the goody bag?
---
That's good to know! I was always a little saddened by the thought when I had thought they were nerfed. I guess people just got good or ragequit.
---
I once told my wife that a ski area was going to open despite having only 6 inches at the base and that it was ridiculous. She, a SoCal girl, said "that's a lot isn't it?" She blue screened when I told her we'd rather have 6 feet. 
---
Some people never experience snow.
---
Well soulcleave is just a minor dps increase it all depends on phase length. It will be super bad in a good group on ensyl since he usually starts just every burst phase on kalla to heal people up and then swaps to shiro for breakbar. Uptime will be super short on that fight.
---
Just look at it like it's a heal instead of an uber dps tool. You can heal through some mechanics but most pug renegades just upkeep it and autoattack. Hell even the dT guide suggests this and I had to explain to a pug once why it's bad. But it can be decent dps if lined up perfectly with a trillion multi hit abilities. "Slow" (8s but still no rush) phase skorvald after port for example. SS added like 60k group damage per phase, that's on par with impossible odds and will be better if there is "we bleed fire". Don't forget that slb elite also triggers it and doubles the damage. But most of the time you want to precast dps spirits and swap to impossible odds for breakbars.
---
Soulcleave uptime can be a signifikant dps increase if you face stuff like we bleed fire where nobody will have scholar if you dont use kalla regularly. But yes, bursting breakbars with impossible odds and pre casted spirits is the way to go almost all the time. All the time if you play with a healfb. Most people don't even know that ren can have decent burst because they only ever see autoattacking ones.
---
Anecdotal evidence is what was given, I responded with the same.
---
With lack of marketing in return, unfortunately. But you are probably right, even though it would be healthy for the future of the game (and ANet) to announce that there actually is a longer future planned for the game except added stories.
---
I hate to say that you’re right
---
No, this has been known for a while now.
---
In countries with backward societies, maybe. If someone pulls that garbage where I live, they better like being out on the streets. I’ve yet to see a successful misogynist/misandrist here.
---
Nobody. Everyone recycles
---
Sweet baby Joko, that Choya
---
They gave out tickets to the first 500 in line, and we can redeem them for the swag after the announcement. I'll try to report back with pics once I get mine.
---
&gt;or a while that following Season 4 will be another LW season. If an expansion is in the works it'll be post S5.
---
Blame the draught on the mmo market, all new mmos several years left in development and not much added in the current mmos that makes them fresh and interesting :(
---
Then GW2 wouldn't be what it is today. The ability to go into WvW or world bosses and see hundreds of players fighting by your side is one of the game's trademarks.
---
Lot of people don't appreciate what GW2 has managed performance wise.
---
A baby chungus!
---
Sweet, thank you!
---
There is a Choya hanging around...
---

---
By Ogden's Hammer, what memes!
---
Then you've been lucky, it happens in the States *especially* in certain regions.
---
&gt;u never know what they'll announced when they are finished talking about living world. They could say Expansion 3 Winter 2020.
---
I will watch, and hope you are right, but I feel like I probably will be disappointed :(
---
Can confirm, am the choya.
---
Haha here too!
---
Which MMO games with equal or higher levels of on-screen activity run better than GW2?
---
[I got it!](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/229/977/6db.jpg)
---
The new cooking level? 500! Seasons? Five of them! Playable races? Five! Five new seasonings?!
---
WE'RE DOING AN IRON CHEF COMPETITION FOR THE FATE OF THE WORLD!
---
Diss my mothers meatball recipe and we’ll see a rare dragon
---
i just want an image of the outfit
---
I mean at its most basic plot we've already done the "prevent a dragon's champion from awakening the dragon" story. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing since it will obviously be a different story, it would just seem uninspired.
---
Anyone got the outfit code?
---
Probably because of spoilers ooh boy
---
Magnus did nothing wrong.
---
80+% of damage dealt in zerg fights is done via physical damage. Epidemic is not a thing in WvW for past year+. -10% incoming damage on any stat food is insanely strong.
---
Ok i did not expect that, i laughed so hard :D
---
Inb4 LS5 is LS1 remaster.
---
Who's the norn/human female?
---
Which living world pack? Because the living world episodes are free
---
We've done it twice really. Second time being Scarlet.
---
I don't think people really care about plots being similar at their most basic. Especially since the *vast* majority of plots are the Hero's Journey.
---
Choya are everywhere man. I wonder if that big one has an infusion in it
---
Might not be anymore
---
Honestly excited, got up early for this.
---
Its good to see Guild Wars 2 on the topside of the twitch channels
---
Pretty sure it's an automated system on twitch.
---
but Im not that content hungry, I like pvp, I will check it out. I mean if it is as good as u say, I cant do anythign wrong.
---
I'm talking about the one they will announce. As the only name we know is "living world" for it now (though according to merch, it is Fire and Frost)
---
That wouldn't make sense.
---
Oooh that would make a lot of people unhappy. Just in case, I'm going to prepare my bunker.
---
Lucky bastard
---
Which would be a massive misstep. I could see them putting in a bunch of stuff though relating to living world, like a supply drop and a bunch of other stuff.
---
Oh HOLY SHIT! That's so cool! :D
---
Me too. Let's hope for the best!
---
Did we find out what's in the swag bags?
---
Responding aggressively and with hyperbole isn't the answer. Take a deep breath.
---
Guild Wars Mobile incoming
---
Show me build templates!
---
I liked that girl who was just giving the camera the stare of fucking death.
---
What is the answer then? Either way doesn't matter how you answer people, they have their "very strong" opinions so they won't bother listening to facts and arguments even if they are literally glued to their faces.
---
If I can vent my frustrations on people like that by calling them out on their idiocy then at least some good came out of it.
---
it's purple from the wiki.
---
Am I expected to know who Greg Miller is? Should I take this to r/outoftheloop?
---
Apparently they hyped up for months now. Supposed to be some big news but I don't expect much tbh
---
its 2am where i am weekend already :D
---
Still plenty of salt in WvW, and rightly so the way the game mode gets neglected.
---
Lol posting a Resident Sleeper emoji gets you auto timed out, great moderation
---
It's going to be ONLY LW; all of the fears from the reddit have been confirmed - this is bad...
---
Tepid legion
---
IGN hype man. Basically he gets asked to host a bunch of these things for a living. He's not like a specific-to-gw person.
---
Really glad for everyone who wanted swiss-style tournaments
---
The PVP news is welcome.
---
BUILD TEMPLATEEEESSSS
---
I mean, duh, we already knew that. We want to know if new mechs or anything (specs, etc) will be added
---
Templates?!
---
Build templates, yessss.
---
TEMPLATES!! I COULD CRY
---
Templates are coming, the meme is dead
---
there's a big but coming
---
HERE IT COMES BOIS
---
ICEBROOD SAGA, what a name
---
Icebrood Saga does sound pretty fucking badass
---
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS at everything I just witnessed.
---
Such gorgeous illustration.
---
Bring on the Ice Borne!!!!
---
ICEBROOD SAGA
---
Jormag, disappointing.
---
Dragon!! Do not speak it's name!!
---
\*cough\* ERP last Week? \*cough\*
---
NORTH! TO The Icebrood Saga
---
Ehat stream?
---
I appreciate the effort that goes into a video like this but the assumptions...the assumptions aren't at all realistic and the conclusions are misleading.
---
The health per second from flat health regen or lifesteal only achieves it's full potential if your health is never full - I.E.  0% scholar uptime.  You should at the very least scale down your healing by the scholar uptime.  If you achieve 70% scholar uptime, for instance, you should expect 140 * (1 - 0.7) = ~ 42 health per second.
---
But this also overstates its effectiveness in raids, since you have healers that also substantially overheal.  So that healing isn't actually giving you more health on net during the fight, it just accelerates a small amount of healing by a couple seconds until the big heals land.
---
The only way to realistically realize the defensive value of the lifesteal proc is to drop all healers from your composition.
---
The real value of that healing proc in a raid is really close to zero.  All of its performance boost, realistically, is in the damage portion of the proc, which is worth about 0.5% DPS.
---
The 10% damage reduction doesn't have such constraints.  It also does most of its work against big hits, allowing you to survive 11% more damage in a burst before being downed.
---
Cilantro vs peppercorn in raids is a pretty easy trade-off between 0.5% more damage or 11% more effective health.  Reasonable people would still take the cilantro food with that trade-off, but don't pretend the defensive properties are remotely comparable.
---
Yep. Another reminder that this game is a pve focus.... People like us(pvp and wvw) suffer.
---
I knew what to expect but to have Mike z blow his entire load in less than a minute was mind boggling!
---
Now it is, it seems.
---
Yeah sure but PoF is cheap and not many people are interested in that.
---
Its seems like the saga will go on for quite some time and will take a lot of manpower, but with no expansion in sight I am not sure how they want to get money from that content.
---
Jormag is a lass? Svanir boys been had!
---
They need to balance the game more then they need an alliance system.
---
Another example of gamers over hyping themselves?! No!
---
Drakkar world boss, nice.
---
Thanks for replying, you showed the care and effort to even type that. Enjoy your 45 minute story every 3 months.
---
yeah something tells me were gonna see another dip in population in wvw after this one.
---
I don't even wanna play anymore either after this shit.
---
Entry Level Open World Raid Bosses? I am down.
---
Players hate seasons! What do we do?
---
Just change the name. Let's call them, ugh, saga!
---
Genius.
---
*Sound of money exploding*
---
Oh that's right, they did say that! Cheers!
---
sub-par content?   
---
You're like me, with 7k hour into the game. The difference is, i'll understand and acknowledge that at some point you're gonna run out of content and get bored of the game. You on the other hand are bitching about it. Protip for your future gaming experience; EVERY GAME EVER WILL GET BORING AT SOME POINT.
---
new world boss looks like a potential skin for raptor mount ;)
---
Yeah, I say we got what was expected, but that isn't enough these days.
---
Didn't he say the exact same thing years ago?
---
IBS
---
Oh my stomach is cramping.
---
I've honestly gotten bored of every single fantasy world to come out in the past decade being a neoliberal multicultural multiracial society of love, tolerance and equality.
---
I thought the whole point of fantasy was to explore different unique worlds and different cultures, but most writers just project their ideal vision of a perfect society instead of trying to create intresting worlds with nuanced conflicts.
---
Conversly this also affected sons of snvanir and flame legion, by making their respective ideologies flatter than oil on a pan because nobody wants to make an actually nuanced conflicting ideology and at the same time writing them out of the story for the past 7 years.
---
No
---
They said it was rolling out next week.
---
They are announcing a new LS season in a theater and made a countdown on twitch with a small preshow and all. If that is not over-hyping something that could have been done only via twitch from their location or on a big blog post then I don't know what would be.
---
🦀🦀🦀 Only 2 Developers BTW 🦀🦀🦀
---
Only ANet can make people come into a conference with zero expectations, yet still make them leave disappointed. Absolute shambles if a company that lacks direction, leadership and talent. Completely pathetic.
---
I'll give it a shot! Also omg that PvP armour is so ugly on the Charr lol
---
Oh
---
that PVP set was disappointing.
---
&gt; imply we'll need to pay for content
---
That's been the case since season 2. Chapters are free when they come out and move to being paid after the next one releases.
---
The writers forgot that Jormag and Primordus are supposed to be heavily weakened after Balthazar drained them, didn't they?
---
S H I T
---
Here come the tantrums
---
Yikes
---
Ah Thanks.
---
Yeah, 4h a week and like 30 mins a day.
---
DEDGEM
---
I logged into reddit to ask for a TE;CW (too euphoric; couldn't watch), so ty for this summary.
---
From an EU PoV, this hyper-euphoric buzzword bull... bingo is quite disconcerting. Feels like hosts, guests &amp;  attendant crowd collectively od'd on prozac + caffeine.
---
WvW update in the coming MONTHS. AWESOME anet fucking THANKS
---
I actually expected something really good for this outfit, but uh... this isn't that.
---
It's the new season of LW. The stuff that will keep the game alive and the stuff people are looking forward too - yet nothing of the shown material besides that one boss isn't even new or created especially for the next LW. They basically reuse assets they've created years ago instead of putting any effort into it to create those new environments. Even for just an update, this is underwhelming at best IMO.
---
So WvW discussions in a couple of months, its been like 2 years WTF anet.
---
Drakaar!!
---
\*saying\* they are, anyway.
---
They are just here provoking and insulting and then they pout because someone calls them out.
---
New PVP set LUL
---
Just curious, how is PoE still interesting to you?   
---
You farm maps over and over and over with the max DPS/clearspeed u can possibly play and hope for lulz lootz. Great game, but it gets dull so quick.
---
I don't think anyone has the guts to defend these clowns at this point. Over two years without meaningful content, huge hype buildup and then what we get is... Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Build templates are definitely good but.. It's not content. I won't keep gw2 on my pc just for 2 hours of stupid story every 4 months
---
They have a VP of Marketing?
---
that's batman
---
Probably the build templates, that feature the community self implemented years ago.
---
It's not done yet.
---
It's just copy-pasted from the old t-shirt outfit with the GW2 logo on it - complete with weird leather diaper shorts.
---
Am I wrong to think that with them actually going on stage that it might be slightly bigger than that? Or something a little extra.
---
Owned all starting from core /shrug
---
Marketing guy is out — this is the area I hope they do not close out with third party stuff 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
---
Im a lore whore, but an art
---
Book didn’t need stage time...
---
Is that game's combat as active and real-timey as guild wars 2 with the dodges, action cam, and such at all?
---
Oooh, that book looks nice
---
HAHAHAHAHA that was it?
---
The fuck is this mike silbowitz ncsoft rep wearing? Lmao. This whole this is a jokeeeee
---
Hello there, i'm from the future, he was right.
---
Wait so am I missing something or there isn't any new dlc? So they made a new announcement show for new title and world story?
---
Oh.........marketing....yay?
---
"Can talk about it in the coming months?"
---
Any variations of the word "excitement" should not be used in another stream
---
Wtf is that marketing guy wearing
---
And he looks and sounds exactly like the guy in charge of GW2's marketing would...
---
Teapot’s idea!!
---
Did you miss the part of the lore where are the dragons have gathered in Tyria since it's the magical centerpoint of the world?
---
So far the only dragon we don't know the whereabouts of is Steve/Bubbles. But we do know it has pushed the underwater races into Tyria, meaning it's probably not too far away either.
---
If there wasn't an explanation for it, I'd agree with you on those odds. But it's canonically explained.
---
yep
---
I'm getting that concept art book for sure!
---
Warclaw killed wvw and now they're just rubbing it in.
---
yeah great, T-Shirts.
---
That VP of marketing is a fucking joke. A Hot Topic shirt?
---
That choya shirt!!!!!
---
theyve said that in the announcement for this announcement
---
All these words that aren't expansions aren't expansions. That's all I need.
---
Holy shit that phone case is ugly.
---
No, it's like a slower version of WoW.
---
So basically they prepared a whole announcement show for a new title and living story..
---
New fashion wars for pvp and something for WvW in.. months, k bye
---
Nobody cares
---
new seasons with some new stuff and trying out new builds. i mean.. if you play standard well.. even the PoE community laughts about STD
---
Too bad he couldn't find a pair of the leggings in his size. LMFAO
---
Shittiest event ever.
---
That weird ass dude with the fucking shill at the end, my sides xD
---
Except they haven’t talked about a single expansion like feature.
---
Yup the new PvP armor looks very bland :S
---
I assume there's a big demand for the LS stuff but it really doesn't do much for me
---
So sad. :(
---
How many paid shills do they have in the audience? Cheering for hoodies on a supposed hype stream?
---
"In the coming months."
---
Hmm.. if I buy PoF from official retailer like dlgamer, will I get hot too?
---
The hunt for buried treasure
---
&gt; Did you miss the part of the lore where are the dragons have gathered in Tyria
---
Did you miss the part where that was completely retconned from the original lore? Sheesh.
---
It all starts to make sense.
---
WHO LISTENS TO MUSIC ON TIDAL!!!!??
---
WE'VE GOT T-SHIRTS BOYS! that's all I ever wanted
---
I'm pretty sure those people live in there were paid to applause. There is no other explanation.
---
already got a tendence what you gonna play in Blight-league?
---
JESUS CHRIST AURENE LOOKS LIKE A NIGHTMARE CHILD KILL IT WITH FIRE.
---
https://i.imgur.com/26k9Td7.gif

Oof. There’s some nice little things that we could’ve and should’ve had by now, like build templates and... build templates. They’re renaming that Wintersday mini intro raid into “strike missions” and expanding it, which is nice for the more serious casual (which is the category I probably fall into). And, honestly, I like having some more story and lore. 
---
But, in the end, these feel like tiny tweaks rather than something that deserved a special event. There’s no features or content that felt “wow, I can’t wait to...” 
---
It’s a steady continuation of what we had with mild ease of use improvements.
---
Achievements have always been content. You can pretend they're not, but you would be wrong.
---
I expect a 6/10 but got a 1/10 show. What a let down.
---
we can accept this fate or defy it. but we cannot deny it
---
Oh, happy to hear that then. I mainly explore stuff nowadays, I would probably farm stuff though since this is an mmo after all.
---
The saga is going to be tied to Path of Fire.
---
Honestly, Jason is hot, the trailer has an interesting art style but that's all the positive things I can say
---
F
---
They're collaborations with third parties. It's unlikely anyone in-studio worked on these aside from someone on the visual design team giving the "ok" to pass visual assets over to the other company for use.
---
Um i understand if WvW players are disapointed about the info of WvW but a Pve player who just told told that they get a evolving saga, with easy acceess to training raidbosses to build your raiding comunity up a boss that will change with time. New worldboss, new events who also will evolve, maps that will evolve and a word of that each chapter in the new saga will have more content. All that is certainly a lot more then we ever got so far for each story. And you call that nothing.
---
WvW got nothing. But this we already knew about and to be fair most of us wvw veterans have reached a point were we feel it is to late anyway with alliances and it will only break wvw more so at this point it is fine i guess.
---
me a WvW player: at least they acknowledged you
---
I've been FFXIV for about a month now. It has a healthy free trial that lets you get to level 35 with basically no substantial restrictions. 
---
The combat is much different and you may find certain classes a drag. Casters for instance have to stand still while casting most spells. But if you stick with a Black Mage you get to scream [explosion!](https://gfycat.com/chubbylightheartedgoldfish) constantly. 
---
But having actual job roles for group content is really fun imo and classes that attack physically are pretty satisfying even early on.
---
No new elite specs, no new weapon types, no new anything, do you even want this game to survive? 
---
You Do NOT make a fuss and rent a big venue for bullshit like this, there was no big feature announcement at all. This could've been done from your live stream booth or even YouTube, there was no need to hint at big announcements with venue for us to hear all that crap.
---
Standard overhype aside... this was literally a 45 minute episode reveal... like total nothing burger.
---
but it said work in progress. which means it feels no closer to actually happening that it was a year ago. There was nothing definite said about it so know no more than did b4 the stream
---
&gt; I figured they would try to sell this new Living Story Season as an "Expansion without an expansion", but, to do that, you need to have expansion level content. You need new features, new classes, new skills, maybe new weapons.
---
What I find weird is they said this season would have expansion like features. What about this is expansion-like? The only point of difference I can see is the mini-raid boss feature.
---
Yea, because rather than trying to exceed expectations, ArenaNet decided to set the bar absurdly high by making this a live event when all they did was do the usual new Living World season announcements. Of course people are going to be disappointed.
---
they should be in "damage control" mode after this shitshow tbh.
---
How fitting.
---
Over the past year or so i've been only really playing each new living world story when they come out then leaving, so i was really hoping this reveal would give me another reason to go back to the game... this showed none of that. I was hoping for some new way to play, but the only thing they showed was new masteries which i assume will be as lackluster as most of the living world masteries. Only real new thing which seemed kind of interesting was the ez mode raids. Besides that its probably gonna be log in every few months for the story from me :(
---
Same, I'm surprisingly invested in the story. I do feel like we're in the minority here though.
---
I'm good.
---
Fixed it. And well, that isn't the problem. The problem is that it hints towards the same garbage "1 episode every 3 months" schedule.
---
Wait so we literally got a TEASER for a new LWS, templates that are met with "fucking finally" because of how long weve asked for them (and they already said months ago are in the works) AND they imply we will have to buy these episodes???? No fucking thanks, what a shitshow
---
Vague is fine. Vague is what I wanted for the LS. But this announcement needed way more revealed in other departments.
---
we can accept this fate or defy it, but we cannot deny it.
---
where was the announcement (like real announcement which requires an 'event')? RIP
---
They think far, far too highly of their ability to create a compelling narrative.
---
Happy to get Norn and Charr. The trailer is also great. Like the art style, like they remembered they did that in the beginning and also that the voice slowly changed. But I really hoped for some meaningful announcements.
---
Also stream showed where the marketing preferences are. Spot on on leggings I would say. They should really get some good marketing people. Community is complaining about that for years.
---
Mike Z. said that they'll continue to pump out content for us for free. So I guess it'll stay the way it is now.
---
I foresee that there will be no Developers comment in any thread on this sub for at least 3 days.
---
you should, next week.
---
I didnt even get a letter.
---
I some how was left expecting less than what they previously promised.  No mention of new fractals, new raids, expansion level features this season was supposed to bring, or alliances they been working on for almost two years now.
---
I just died reading this. RN is my sould who is posting this. LMAO
---
Anyone have a link to the dark horse gw2 page?
---
Uh oh, the incels downvoted. :3
---
And people think this game isn't dead lmao
---
I really wonder about that negative feedback that is quite normal these days about every single tease and preview in the internet. Has Blizzard hired some trolls for this?
---
We received some info about what the next season will be about, we got some neat new quality of life features, we got a tease about a lot of stuff to come. The lore desigers basically confirmed they will try a new release/update pattern. All in all it almost seems that ANet tries to switch from a expac-release-cycle into more dynamic seasonpass style. Which may fix the long breaks between new updates. Quite a lot of cool new infos and a good sign that we will have more content soon
---
Those images are a great example of how cancerous these ''veterans'' are
---
Yes. I'm the "casual" veteran fan who's kind of their main audience, but even I see that **they've done more harm with this than good**.
---
But then again, ^almost everything that's been done by the new marketing team has been incredibly amateurish and really out of touch with reality from the very beginning. From the random quotes to not knowing basic video editing to, finally, astroturfing their own ads on reddit and mind-boggling partnerships like Kung Fu and whatever watches.
---
I'm actually really looking forward for more charr and norn culture stuff :) I love lore, and new places and ambient dialogues &lt;3
---
Give me something for the pain and let me die.
---
you knew it was gonna be a season before anything else. let's bring up expansion in 1.5 years
---
Bwhahhahahah fml
---
But you're getting NEW ARMORS.
---
You forgot something...
---
Public audience at the event: "A new glider?" - cheer as you just won 1 million
---
Ah nice! Hope you enjoyed the show.
---
Probably for one of the giveaways.
---
So you know that big announcement that we had? Well, we're proud to announce that in a few months we'll have an annoucement. Oh, new WvW _content_? Nah, we good.
---
Alliances won't be necessary. We'll be able to put everyone who's left into a single matchup and it _still won't be full_.
---
....but we got Jason 🤤
---
More than Strike Missions themselves, I'm interested in seeing what new system will obsolete them when Anet discard them and decide they want to reinvent the wheel again like they did for dungeons and raids.
---
&gt; Capcom finally confirmed Thunder SWOLE Doggo.
---
Guess I missed this one. Care explain plz?
---
Vortex/Cold Snap starter, playing in the HC trade leagues, what are you playing?
---
Feels like more of the same..    and we didn't get that level of hype before..so why bother now?....  
---
Oh yeah.. that's right...     to push merch
---
I know, it was meant sarcastically.
---
&gt;What do YOU want exactly?
---
Non broken AP system (temporary achieves, removed achieves, unattainable achieves)  
---
No bots in PvP  
---
Some Love for WvW  
---
Some long term goals (like GWAMM in gw1)  
---
Instruments working like they did pre 2018 november update.  
---
That would satisfy me.
---
You're not alone. This was the only MMO i've ever played more than a year for. It was great while it lasted. Goodbye GW2.
---
I think word "Stupid" suits you better.
---
Black Mage is definitely satisfying because of all the Fire IVs
---
my condolences, you probably spent more time waiting than there was of the announcement
---
Clear tounge in cheek joke, but it's still insanely disappointing nonetheless.
---
it has a free trial up to lv35
---
Basically they saw that the community was getting sour so they decided a live event would be the best way to hype people back up over a big announcement, but they had no big announcement to make. So they cobbled together all the normal and or little updates they have planned that would typically just be put in a roadmap post, mixed in some promises to add in a couple long requested features and topped it off with a bunch of lore discussion for filler.
---
The staff on stage looked uncomfortable in the way you look uncomfortable when you're trying to talk but you don't actually have much to say, and the audience often cheered more out of formality and the need to feel hyped then out of actual excitement.
---
It was saddening more then anything, as it was that exact situation where things aren't looking good and you know they aren't looking good yet for some reason everyone around you is still acting like it's fine.
---
The future of Guild Wars 2 is pretty much what you could have generally guessed on your own. So so.
---
It hurts so god damn much to see the game I love in this state and continuing to go down this path.
---
Well, a lot of commanders then.
---
I think the strike missions are very much going to be an expansion worthy feature (people are probably a bit too bitter when they just jump to believing they are bounties), but other than that, no, nothing. I look forward to the new season, but this announcement was too barebone.
---
I half expected a #DIRECTED BY ROBERT B.WEIDE
---
Same for WvW comment, my such a disappointed
---
The fact that they advertised a 45 minute livestream in a theater implies to me that there is more information than a simple blogpost. This is one time I can’t blame the community for overhyping. There is literally nothing of note here.
---
Wait, how is that a bad thing? Ep. 2 is months away. They have so much time to polish up design and mechanics so it's ready to go. Did you want them to say "we finished it up and are just going to sit on it until then"
---
Good bye Guild Wars 2. It has been fun.
---
Lol, that's a false equivalency if I ever saw one. I didn't say that was anywhere near "50x the content".
---
They're going to roll it out next week, if you don't get it, contact support. The only content Belgians don't get is lootbox related, I don't see why this should be blocked.
---
Blame Anet for that issue. Anet has some of the worst management of any MMO developer I've ever seen, and I have no qualms if NCSOFT blows their face off in a few years. They deserve it.
---
You mean it will make them fun for everyone else. This will be a great method to teach new raiders mechanics.
---
Millennials LUL
---
GW1 in my heart, GW2 in my toilet.
---
They WERE weakened, i remember the whole point was that they could've even died if it kept up and that their readings were back to hibernation levels.
---
So how and why did Jormag awaken? What stupid excuse will they make for this when the story itself was literally perfect to go face the Deep Sea Dragon instead?
---
Hard to say really.  But maybe the wording was just to make sure any new people in the audience understood that it was free entry content at least.  
---
But they definitely danced around the wording there.  Guess we have to wait and see.  You'd think they would say something though because existing players would obviously like to know if it differs from normal.
---
Remember all those people that memed about alliances 2020 back in the first blog post?
---
Yeah right
---
Given that the countdown stream had a snowstorm setting, the actual trailer didn't reveal anything that we already didn't reasonably expect.
---
..did.. did you read the title..?
---
#DIRECTED BY ROBERT B.WEIDE
---
I've been completely happy to give Anet the benefit of the doubt, support them and wait for this announcement.
---
But they've totally just shat the bed.
---
We needed a hint of elite specs at least. The easy mode raids might be fun for a bit but that was so chronically insubstantial.
---
Will still be fun to play the new episode but I can see my attention and time going elsewhere.
---
I missed the glider part a bit, do all heart of thorns owners get it free or what?
---
its over
---
It's nice that they're coming. Though I'm a bit worried that UX is going to be total crap, just like customize screen :( and arcdps templates will immediately get turned off.
---
You did that yourself you dumbass sheeple!
---
"Prologue is free" means all future episodes will NOT be free anymore. I imagine that episodes will be more than just 2 or 3 hours of content. I expect something more like a "mini-expansion" per episode.
---
What the hell is a funko pop?
---
Then why are you here? You look desperate and sad instead
---
Jason was worth me staying up til 1am to watch this stream.  Thanks, Japan Standard Time.
---
Cant wait to not use them.
---
For the curious, this is what is in the armor package: https://i.imgur.com/BIGIyhH.jpg
---
Nah it was just really shitty phrasing.
---
Sadly true. I was enjoying the discussion on the countdown stream and way more than this announcement of nothing. They hyped it like an expansion with the theatre while this should have better stayed in their studio
---
So it's 30 minutes now? Please record a video of one episode ran in 30 minutes.
---
worse, september 17 is proloque, episode 1 is in January , episode 2 will be in April/may
---
&gt; That's all it should have been. 
---
That's all it has been, spread in 45 minutes with the addittion of advertising and that's a shame.
---
This wasn't for me but i'm hoping Anet comes back later with better stuff. I'll keep waiting, not buying gems, but waiting for sure.
---
Been wanting Norn focus for years. I have a Norn Druid and Norn Dragonhunter that I really want to see run through their ancestral homelands. I also have a Norn necro I am levelling and a brand new Norn Warrior. So yeah, I'm pretty excited.
---
Pvp players literally get 3 skins that prolly took 5 minutes to make and they dare to call that content.
---
They didnt even talk about WvW.
---
Who cares about that free ugly ass glider.
---
Hopefully irl winter is this short and disappointing
---
my point is exactly what you read. the whole story of gw2 is about the elder dragons. since the personal story weve been dealing with elder dragons, the story has them as the center point. why would it change? the said this game is about their story, so how come you are dissapointed now? im sure all these reddit crybabies would shut up if they just anounced new specializations, but no one said there would be any
---
The nail in the coffin for many people today.  I think a lot of WvW players are relieved in a way that we no longer have to worry or have any hope things will get better.
---
But hey, if you love lore and care about who Rytlock's children are, you're gonna have a great time in the coming months!
---
Two years from the last expansion, they rented a theatre to tell us its the status quo... They had over 30,000 people watching on twitch and barely said anything.
---
I mean. My first comment never said that achievements werent content. You put those words in my mouth and kept throwing a tantrum.
---
That was said when we were killing dragons and just leaving the magic to flood out everywhere, though.
---
We don't know how different it is when the lions share of the magic is immediately absorbed by something else - if Balthazar's death is anything to go by, it's nowhere near as bad.
---
*"Oh yeah that one PvP guy in the back! Woo"* 
---
- Proceeds to re-hash SWISS as a new feature when it was supposed to be implemented in June 2018. 
---
**New feature btw, coming soon Living Story SAGA 5 btw**
---
I had hoped that ArenaNet would step up and prove themselves to be better, to be redeemable. I just feel mocked. I haven't been this disappointed in a long, long time.
---
Guess I am in a minority and am cautiously hyped for the new story. People are making such a big deal out of everything. Yea I get it you don't feel like playing the same raids and fractals everyday anymore. That's me too, I fill my time with other games. But the difference is that it doesn't have to be all or nothing. I will never abandon GW2 completely, I will log in for whatever new stuff they bring to game. But guess most people are only interested in fraction of the content and thus quit.
---
&gt; I am getting worried, are we really not getting elite specs for another 1-2 years??
---
We are likely not getting them at all.
---
u/FlufferNightmare missing the point / r/Guildwars after 48hours and and blogposts of hype after getting into a big theatre with a live audience for a live announcement and talking about being super excited for it minutes before only to say they are going to do exactly what they told us they were going to do months ago and absolutely nothing else.
---
If this told us anything, it is that ArenaNet tries their hardest not to make a MMO.
---
"If you hate America, leave our country".
---
There was nothing there.
---
New season \[which we knew\] that involves Jormag \[who should be asleep and near dead thanks to Balthazar\] with not even a peep of Specs \[which is the main expansion-level content people love\] and a big middle finger to WvW \[which people have been begging Anet to fix\].
---
Oh, and lets not forget they've said multiple times that they were going to do some things for this Season that they only did for expansions, which so far has been.......absolutely nothing, unless by some mental gymnastics you manage to think TEMPLATES are expansion-level content.
---
This is, sadly, the right answer.
---
You a new player, or a player who's dabbled with casual/F2P content? You just heard that you can buy _the complete game_, both expansions, for a mere $30. You just heard that there's an awesome new story coming up where you get to fight a terrifying ice dragon. You just heard that there's an easier path to get into raiding and other end-game content. You just got build templates without needing a third-party add-on. You heard about updates to other game modes, and those updates will maybe even be live by the time you're experienced enough to try them.
---
You a veteran? You heard that we get yet another LS episode and a gilder.
---
It's more that they really hyped this announcement and it pretty much boiled down to "business as usual, also buy our new merch".
---
The issue is that many people hoped for something big, and ANet happily fed that expectation. If I recall correctly they didn't even hype PoF's announcement like this. Do you think this announcement was more exciting than the PoF announcement? Because it sure seems like ANet thought so
---
It's been coming very soon for over a year lmao
---
Just a game  that people care about, put time and money into. So yeah they care.
---
At least they said that they would be in game, instead "we would talk about it in next months"
---
I
---
Well, don't you think that is the kind of stuff you'd announce at a big announcement in a theatre? I will say the quality of the story from that cutscene did look pretty good (i.e. "expansion worthy") and hearing about the new masteries was nice. But if they were going to do something big like Elite Specs from Living World or anything else Expansiony not done previously in Living World, then I'd have expected them to at least have mentioned it today.
---
Personally, I am fine with another season of Living World, but with how unsure some of the community has been in the game's future, it seemed strange to make such a big deal for such an ordinary announcement. Like they live-streamed a 48-hour countdown for what ended up being little more than a Living World trailer... You can blame player expectations, but they definitely could have built it up better. And if they are holding back on big features, they really dropped the ball on not announcing them when 30K players were watching.
---
What irks me is the venue choice. Why set this up to be new and exciting when all we got was same old tired announcement? Why not make a blog post or a simple twitch stream from AnetHQ? Same results but less hype and therefore less backlash and disappointment. 
---
Everything said today was 100% expected. Except for the new strike bosses, something nobody asked for and now pretty much guaranteed that dungeons are never coming back, we got nothing to be excited for. Nothing worthy of an “expansion’s worth of stuff” that they promised, at least for the things shown today.
---
Most likely reason I can think of is this; they hyped the announcement and hired a big venue to cause a lot of fuss so that HOPEFULLY new players would notice and find out about the “Buy PoF get Hot deal”. That and to overcompensate and try to convince us that the game isn’t headed for the chopping block anytime soon.
---
Im sorry what about new Fracs? New WvW stuff? New Raids? Hell where is the new expansion. NONE of what they announced today was worth what they did today. What they showed is not content worth justifying what they did today.
---
"NEAR FUTURE"  not really
---
Now this is picky, but I don't like the playstyle of all classes, so in some ways it's like saying 30 flavours of ice cream, but only 5 being actually tasty (to my pallate) so it's more of an illusion of choice in some ways
---
Yep. Still. Not gonna put it randomly on any character. Gotta have a consistent look. Fashion Wars yo
---
Seriously, it's astonishing how many entitled manchildren with no life beyond the game come out of the woodwork whenever they aren't immediately catered to. Someone should do a masters thesis based on this subreddit, or something.
---
(x) Doubt
---
waited for years for this outfit
---
100000000000 x thank you :D
---
Reddit thought police, deleting your post in 3,2,1.... Fucking nazis
---
It's vaguely a roadmap. It's trip planning.
---
She’s also in the shirt alongisde Rytlock and Braham, I assume she’s a new central character
---
I asked for Pops
---
&gt; if they were gonna say sth, they would.
---
Dunno... Mike seemed exhausted. I'll go on a wild guess here: the cuts from way back really did hit so much that the company just can't recover, and the management is in complete disarray, not even able to plan properly and communicate about their plans because everything's falling apart. I don't want this to be true, but it does explain this outcome.
---
WE ARE GETTING NORTH,no swimsuits :(
---
You're an idiot.
---
this community is shit
---
Wish they had taken some of that merch time and put it towards talking about what the other Saga content teams are working on. I get it's 'not ready', but if they're going to do a big announcement reveal, announce some plans.
---
Now Now, what about Clayton
---
Btw you have to wait another half a month to play the PROLOGUE ahhahahahahah wtf anet. Then we wait another 2 months for episode 1?
---
&gt;Classic is definitely not all hype.
---
You'll see.  
---
&gt; People have been playing this game on private servers for years 
---
Because it's free.  
---
&gt;  launch had something like 1.2mil viewers on twitch. 
---
all hype/nostalgia.  
---
&gt; I sat in a 6 houe queue last night. 
---
early stages, get back to me in a couple of weeks.  
---
&gt; When has GW2 ever seen hype or excitement at this level? 
---
irrelevant to the discussion, different type of game.  
---
&gt; Obviously it won't be this insane forever but I doubt the dropoff will be as big as many think. 
---
You'll see  
---
&gt; You're just another uninformed person circlejerking about nostalgia. 
---
&gt; Hey crazy thought, maybe it's the fucking game design. 
---
It's the lore that has WoW going. The game design is a ripoff of all that were before, which were many hamster wheel games. Fun tho! not when u gotta pay for it.
---
It depends on how strike missions are received. They better be more than 10 man bounties
---
I'm happy that the story is going to have a focus on the Charr. That being said, I am incredibly disappointed that we got no real announcements. The announcement for Path of Fire was like 20 minutes yet somehow managed to have *more* content in it than this 40 minute presentation.
---
As someone who has a background of many years being an instanced PvE player, I think the introduction of Strike Missions will be an interesting concept that will eventually fall flat on its face, or end up being more challenging than the raids Anet releases once a year. Seeing WvW get completely brushed off was honestly crushing, and PvP being mentioned for all of like 2 seconds was pretty shitty.
---
The first thing I noticed about this presentation was how Mike Z looked like he was either about to burst into tears or pass out from anxiety. Now I understand why.
---
as a casual player this is trash
---
Yup. Story is good, location is good, using all masteries is good, new mastery sounds fine, one map being a multi-episode thing is ultimately good. 
---
If we go back to 3 month or 3 month+ for every release and this is all we're getting, and we're not even getting more elite specs, an xpac, legendary gear, etc... oh man. Man oh man.
---
Massive let down for me sadly. LW seasons just don't do it for me. I know tons of content gets added with them but I can't get into episodic content.
---
Such a let down... :(
---
You mean the Veteran pack thing? IIRC they said next week.
---
Rented the front crowd from Bethesda.
---
Anet doing what the community couldn't. They've made a ~~climate change denier~~ anet whiteknight reevaluate their opinion.
---
Only like 10 people play raids. It really doesn't matter
---
I wouldn’t say that having a whole event and live stream is nothing. They could have just released a blog post but they led into this it is fully arena nets fault.
---
People are not going to remain excited about 2-3 hours of story content every few months for years expansions are what tends to keep players.
---
A large portion of this event was just trying to sell merchandise!
---
I stopped playing over a year ago now and when the stream started I was kinda hopeful "oh trailer kinda neat ok" and started re-downloading the game and then the WvW comment of "in the coming months" and then the wierd guy shilling stupid figurines on stage and then its over I just stopped the download midway and got rid of the files. 
---
Honestly Anet is pretty lucky the MMO genre isn't at a great spot right now cause if they've had any decent competition they'd be out of the game by now.
---
Nearby isn’t good enough. Build templates are fundamental to the game that both myself and many others literally stopped playing the game when Arc build templates stopped working. WvW has been in such a bad spot for so long that “it’ll come eventually” just isn’t satisfactory anymore.
---
An announcement that announces that things are coming *eventually* instead of being released definitively in the near future isn’t actually announcing anything at all.
---
No? They have only ever said that they are working on it. Never given any sort of indication of a time line for it.
---
think i have 2.5k total with most of it being in WvW and raids and I'm done with almost all of the content.
---
its 7 years already, with how classes work with different type of gear and they make build templates sth a.s a big announcement WTF... instead of w8 another "couple of months" just download arcdps templates and play with it now... damn this is worse than if they didn't do this at all
---
It's basically the bubble tea thing but with the HoT logo instead of the dragon 2.
---
Gee, I spent $150 on Guild Wars 1 and now it's $40. For all of it. Oh the pain. 
---
Tell you what. You give up all the time you've spent playing and all your progress to get HOT free. Because that's what this is. They're removing barriers to entry for new people starting the game. Best thing they could actually do. Makes it so that people can just buy one product and get it all. This doesn't hurt veterans it helps them. Because it encourages new players to come into the game.
---
LS1? LS3? PoF? None of those were focused on a dragon.
---
Plus the fact they seem to constantly cut their audio for seemingly no reason made it feel like it was all faked.
---
I'm a bit excited too.
---
The problem is that there are massive and long-standing problems with various game modes, all of which need to be addressed.
---
The old presentation style of LW has gotten stale, and we wanted to know how this season will be different. That really wasn't addressed.
---
ANet teased that this season will have expansion-level content, which most people hoped/prayed/assumed was elite specs, but there was absolutely no mention of it.
---
It's not all bad, but given the state of the game, this was severely less than it needed to be to encourage hope for the future in a lot of players.
---
Same
---
They shot themselves in the face*
---
ftfy
---
My problem with the anouncement is, that it's such little content. Anet was silent for so long and then hyped up a date to show us what?
---
Eyyyyyy we got a new LWS and we didn't forget PvP... We have a new armoe for you guys. I know it's ugly, but it's yours! And WvW? No we didn't forget you! But we have nothing to deliver for you for the next several months and we will stay silent and mayve give you the PvP armor later on, so sorry PvPers, the armor is not just yours anymore. But you sure not so angry, because it's ugly anyways, right?
---
When you claim the living story will have expansion level content, you're expected to provide evidence of that.
---
It is in fact not a roadmap. There are no deadlines. As it is right now we get new content like every 3 months for pve players. Every 2.5years for pvp players. And every 6 Years for WvW. Roadmap is needed. They gotta stop feeding the casuals or their whole hardcore community is gonna quit.
---
Imagine a game running on gw1s engine that takes 7 years to release a feature that the base game had
---
How dare you, that update should have been a blog post
---
Slowly?  Haha.  This sub is like twitch chat in reddit form right now.
---
Yes you are
---
No but actually, what's the point?
---
I honestly don't agree with that we need to already have an expansion. It was three years between core and HoT and for as long as content was being dropped that was fine. Having a season to warm up the expansion and one to cool it down is imo a good thing and we are now in the warm up
---
I quit like 10 months ago, welcome to the club brother. ;)
---
and ppl actualy went there...... F.
---
We was like - Oh, capes!
---
Not. No capes.
---
They won't give you the roadmap because most of content for Season 5 is not even designed yet.
---
Clearly you don't play Mechwarrior Online.
---
F.
---
2-day timer btw
---
I think it's meant to be keep on going across multiple LW seasons, perhaps? That's even worse... We'll never get to Cantha again.
---
Sad but true
---
no u
---
no, any opinion being circlejerked is a circlejerk
---
honestly i don't care about build templates and care a bout fighting a dragon..
---
Damn it we already killed you Kralk.
---
They were referring to WvW match-making, which is basically currently automated.  In theory, that would be much better with alliances.
---
decent merchandisehttp://puu.sh/EbqO4/e57521e74b.png ???
---
False. I never hyped myself.
---
I'm strictly referring to the hyping they did, announcing it in multiple platforms, multiple times...the 48 hr countdowns, etc.
---
Don't assume...because when you do...well, I'm sure you know how the saying goes...or maybe you don't considering you just assumed.
---
Who the hell likes those soulless eyes and faces stung by bees. Who likes this garbage?
---
Strike Missions are basically like Trials from FFXIV.
---
So, instanced single boss raids.
---
God, you're dense. I'm done "talking" to you.
---
When nobody wants do do your content, the solution is to stop making that kind of content, not to quadruple down into finding ways to force players into that kind of content.
---
I've been upset about this announcement, but let me step up here to defend it.
---
Dragons are getting boring in a lot of ways, yes. However, take a look at what we have here. First, we have the political intrigue involving the charr legions and Bangar Ruinbringer possibly acting as a minor villain. Then, we have Jormag, carrying an unearthly horror theme unlike any of the previous dragons. It also seems like Jormag is more subdued and may have a different approach or even a different motivation than we're used to.
---
I'm open-minded about it. At least we have more going on than another blind charge toward another dragon. There's plenty of room for this to be good.
---
Maybe you're just bad?
---
Yeah I'm playing Destiny 2, ESO, GW2, Anthem and getting ready for Borderlands 3. Sure I end up progressing slower, but I'm still having fun with all of them.
---
The difference between us is that you’re naive and I’m not.
---
Classic is super fun right now if you're into that whole sorta thing. I don't know how it will do long term, but I think it's worth checking out imo
---
Oh yeah. Hopefully these missions will seep into the core game and expansions/living world zones.
---
How does someone work as a commercial
---
dead
---
The blog post says episodes are free if you log in during it's release (just like before).
---
Am I the only one who enjoyed both of the men equally? The guy next to Jason was a fucking hunk too. :D
---
It really does boil down to ''the feature i wanted was not announced''
---
Majority of the playerbase is going to enjoy the new content but the very vocal minority will always be screeching in the background
---
I like that they seem to have found a gorgeous middle ground between the older painterly trailers and the more recent in-engine ones. The style kind of reminds me of the more recent MTG set trailers!
---
[New meta-face incoming: ](https://i.imgur.com/jO88D7c.png)
---
windows key + R, type in appwiz.cpl and uninstall gw2.
---
They showed strike missions and even explained that they are content specifically made to help people get into raids. What makes you think that they won't release new raids after this?
---
Exactly what I got from it too.
---
Instanced with two different ways of going in, random up to 10 players, or premade. Just like the Dragon Bash arena.
---
I'm very excited about this, I've always wanted some kind of new pve content that isnt too hard and not too easy, or takes too much time, and this is the nice middle ground.
---
It did reveal a new charr face and horns. The face wasn't bad either, so not EVERY male charr will be a sad lion.
---
Then people would bitch about them not sharing stuff with the community. It's like they can never win. Stay quiet and they get shit on. Start talking and they get shit on.

---
I’m not arguing that the gem store is a bad idea. I think it’s fine. But why would I buy something on the gem store if I barely play the game to begin with? 
---
It really doesn’t have to do with mentality, or people’s low standards. Their current model really does not keep players online for long at all. It’s just the fact that the more I play the game, the more I see gem store stuff, and the more likely I am to buy stuff from it.
---
It went as expected, the pvp comment killed me LOL
---
Yes maybe you are right. But then NcSoft told them, hey don't even hope for releasing another expac or big feature. Just try to cowmilk the community with skins, plushes and figures or otherwise you are gone.
---
Because of the hype and expectations. Don't get me wrong, I agree with you- I'm absolutely stoked with what we're getting- but understandably, it's not exactly worth the whole timer shtick. Making it sound like such a huge deal had people expect too much, especially veterans. It would've been much, MUCH better well received if it were released as a blog post or a smaller guildchat stream.
---
Looks like Jhavi Jorasdottir. I hope it's her.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
It was presented the same way that PoF was, countdown and all. I think it was reasonable to have high expectations.
---
If that means more frequent story id be down for it. Plus keeps the maps actually alive after.
---
I have played every single drop of content this game has offered to me. But since my friends got bored of this game before me, I went from full hardcore (15k hours soon) to casual that logs in mostly for new content or do some stuff alone. I still love this game and will follow it till the end. But I understand vast majority of players are not like me.
---
I think the best way to sum it up is players are hating on the announcement because past living world trailers have never gotten an announcement. We already knew S5 was coming and you're right that free Living World update are nice. But when there already was some uncertainty about having another season of Living World instead of an expansion, making a big event just to announce the same old doesn't help those concerns. If there were things there worthy of an announcement instead of a normal trailer and blog post, they didn't do a good job emphasizing them.
---
well, this definitely aint it then, they said they want to deliver expansion like content not that they will
---
Soon™
---
they didnt even say the word "alliances"
---
Can I have your stuffs?
---
I don’t mean the dragons themselves but rather how we fight them. One person or a couple of people take on a giant dragon and we win of course. I just miss humanoid foes. Makes more sense to me
---
Julia &lt;3 Choya cosplay &lt;3
---
Content that requires you to cooperate and interact with other human beings to tackle a challenge, while putting time to to practice and think about strategies, then coming out victorious is one of the best feelings of gaming, in an online game.
---
Or you could play a single player campaign with quick time events that you have no reason to replay.
---
I do enjoy the the story in gw2 but fuck off with the "replayable content is trash and only story matters" attitude.
---
If you're leaving can I have your stuff?
---
Are you serious? Maybe your feature didn't get announced?
---
No wvw, pvp, raids or fractals???? ARE YOU SERIOUS?
---
It's better than nothing, and the revenue is always good.
---
I also prefer when they spend more time on the trailer than putting content in the game
---
Dude, leave the cosplayer alone. 
---
All that effort of getting dressed up for... that presentation.
---
Some of us were playing ONLY guild wars since it was time consuming and other games didn't feel right.
---
So 7 years of relationship and then you find another great lie.. Will you continue?
---
If you were playing more games, you won't understand.
---
Nice, now they milk even more via ingame shop.
---
No, this is expansion like content.
---
Tough luck?
---
I was hoping for next week.
---
I don't know what point you're trying to make (well, actually I do), but the only point you're making here is that you're not even capable of uninstalling a game.
---
I liked the stream very much, can't wait for Sep 17! New content finally!
---
No it wasn’t.
---
The last time they made an announcement, they didnt say it was about living story.
---
They also said that we should join them for a 45 min exciting announcement on the 30th...
---
Sure they can "months" as in 1 month or infinity.
---
They hyped this up by renting a venue and counting it down... Of course people were expecting them to say something. The announcement of a new season of the living world... Sorry "Saga" could have been a blog post. They had more people watching on twitch than they have in years and they said nothing.
---
I'm a very casual player since launch but was still hyped for this announcement.
---
Very disappointed to be honest. Living story is a given at this point, and I'm sure what they'll do will be very good. But the game isn't *just* living story.
---
Thoughts :
---
- Does this mean they will always do theatre style announcements for Living Story now?
---
- Build templates are coming - but no date? Sounds like they mentioned it just because people would be upset otherwise.
---
- No roadmap, which means no way of knowing if they are scrapping expansions. I still think they are, but don't want to announce it because of the negative feedback. This is also why they are starting a transition of making the expansions free.
---
- Some new skins... okay
---
All in all, okay all good but nothing to be excited about. All my time will continue to be on No Man's Sky!
---
i can't get over that people were actually clapping and cheering at stuff... like how can anyone be excited for literally any of that
---
Shut the fuck up holy shit.
---
post in the mega thread instead of creating more circlejerk
---
Nobody was expecting expansion level content, everyone was expecting something even worthwhile of such a big announcement, everyone got led on for an entire month and they bombed so bad it's disgusting.
---
There was no content announced, it's just another living world season and build templates being re-announced for the third time.
---
How do you get 30k people to join and yet drop the ball on something so simple?  
---
Nothing was announced that we didn't already know.
---
GW2 is an mmo. It's not going to last under continued updates of bite-sized single player content updates and new outfits in the gem store. And it needs to be bringing in revenue for those continued updates, so, even if you think that's all the game needs, you ought to be hoping that ArenaNet does more to attract players, not less.
---
Sure, getting free content is great, but free content comes second to *interesting* content. It's easy to play cheaply in today's game market. The greater factor, for most people, is whether the content is worth playing. And if the content is good enough, most people are willing to shell out a little bit more money to have that more worthwhile experience.
---
I've been playing GW since the days of the original Prophecies campaign. I've been to various ArenaNet events. I'm a big fan, and I want the game to succeed. But ArenaNet needs to commit themselves to making a game that will succeed, and, right now, I don't think they're doing that.
---
IBS - Irritable Bowel Syndrome
---
The trailer is pretty cool yeah.
---
IBS, sorry.
---
I'm a cynical asshole. They already promised us expansions worth of content with season 1; which compared to S3 or S4 was nothing. I didn't really expect anything more than what they showed us.
---
You really shouldn’t get so upset about internet comments. It’s really unhealthy.
---
Dammit Urianger not here as well
---
I never played WoW before and I'm having a lot of fun in Classic.
---
But, yeah, the new Star Wars stuff is shit.
---
On the flip side, playing the intented 2 days every 3 months makes the lack of new and exciting playstyles much much more tolerable.
---
It's ... a joke ... not an insult.  Relax
---
You should quit playing the game then. I hear Vanilla WoW is superhype and non stop action.
---
GW2 is a game that succeeds despite anet's best efforts to sabotage it.
---
Cool story bro
---
Then delete the game modes from the game. Individually they might be smaller groups, but together they form a good size portion of the player base and they're leaving in droves.
---
what does swiss tournaments even mean? im ootl
---
Commentor's Note: the people that make the trailer are not a content design team.
---
If you're leaving, can I have your gold?
---
If they mention it as "10 player content", it'll be instanced somehow.  Otherwise, there'd be nothing stopping more than 10 players from participating.
---
I imagine the comparisons to the Dragon Bash Arena are apt.  You can bring your own pre-made group, or join a 'public' instance with random matchmaking.
---
Can't relate, Funko dory and Funko donkey haunt me in my dreams. They're all overpriced plastic pieces of garbage that people harrass retail workers to reserve.
---
C O N T E N T
---
So am I the only one who actually thinks that is a female voice actor whose voice has just been drastically pitched down? To me it sounds similar to how female kodan sound in the game - I mean the post processing, I do believe it's Jormag speaking.
---
You being bored with a game =/= game being dead
---
WvW? Raids? Are you serious?
---
Either:
---
 
---
A) it's easier for two dragons to absorb magic from a weakened god than it is for a weakened god to absorb magic from two dragons (AKA it was the less bad of two bad options) 
---
B) Balthazar leaving with the magic would have Caused Problems (tm)
---
C) Bad writing.
---
it's the exact same skin. The only thing that has changed is the texture, and it's still dogshit.
---
Underrated comment.
---
I don't think there will be much drama now. Most people will just leave in silence. You have drama when there's still a chance, when your football team is struggling to move forward.
---
Once it's in the mud no one gives a shit. I fear we'll start noticing that trend soon enough, and that's how a game really starts to die.
---
Cool reply - works for almost every situation. You've really added value here
---
ゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴ
---
how many days have i waited for this moment, for the one who stood alone against the storm, for the one they called the Living World Announcement.
---
Truer words have never been spoken.
---
how is it an "achievement" when you can't fail, it's more like a participation trophy
---
Hoes mad
---
Good riddance
---
Deep Sea Dragon
---
Then why are you posting here? ??  
---
Get gone already...
---
7 years of that pattern, but hey... positive outlook, you could be right...
---
&gt; Armor Voucher
---
The hell, that's *one skin* and not "Armor"!
---
Are you serious? You don't miss a deadline by years on a thing that was supposed to take a year...
---
A year and a half on alliances and still NOTHING.
---
You didn’t answer my question.
---
Let's face this: all this event was just to announce they are partnered with some companies releasing overpriced stuff.
---
All the things about LWS...excuse me, ***S A G A***...were nowhere exciting. This is the kind of content we were bashed with for the past 4 years: a new story, new drama, a group that the story and drama is focused on, a new boss with new mechanics. 
---
That's it. That's really it.
---
The emptiness I felt after the stream wasn't filled with long asked build templates, and a new armor set. So what I can make build templates soon? I want new elite specs, a content expansion worthy...something to keep me playing this game. Something that will drag me into GW2 for weeks, like Epstein dragging children in his dungeon, and release me only after I'm satisfied, leaving me in awe. 
---
But no.
---
[Based on their past posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=world+restructuring&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on) "World Restructuring" **is** their official name for alliances.  Same thing.  But yes, they should've talked more about lots of things.
---
That’ll be a very valuable item in the future. 
---
Keep it
---
&gt; A lot of people have been demanding Cantha, but I think they have catered to GW1 nostalgia enough with Path of Fire.
---
Which is weird because hardly anyone was asking or Elona.
---
" Why does Ruinbringer look like a sad excuse for a Balto villain? This guy is supposed to be one of the most intimidating charr in Tyria, and he looks like a cartoon. "
---
Probably to pander the crowd who makes Charr characters and draws them in bikinis to flood the subreddit.
---
I mean, they made it clear today they're the target audience.
---
For anets sake hope it stays the way it has been
---
Nice meme.
---
If you think the disappoint is about season 5 or lack of expansion it shows you didn't read anything people have actually said, you just turned off your brain/eyes/ears and dismiss any criticism as whining/bitching/moaning/toxicity/negativity.
---
That's disrespectful but hey you do you.
---
Still gives you about 160 hours of new content to try out.
---
What armour gives you that purple "eternity" effect?
---
I didn't know about the whole 3rd Expansion being cancelled, but yeah from what I can tell anet is in a shitshow and I'm not sure how they can escape.
---
I hope they will upload it on YouTube just so I can put a fucking dislike on it.
---
They want to go full Blizzard, i'll just answer them.
---
Abaddon was definitely a God and we killed him too
---
If you Google "tire fire" you can see pictures of the road map
---
It certainly was/is a disappointment yeah
---
I got a notification on my watch for cyberpunk 2077 live stream as the gw2 stream train wreck was about to start, should've gone to see that instead.
---
The pops didn't make me mad.... the phone case and t-shirt did....   
---
It's hard to make people want to rep your game IRL when they barely have reason to play it.
---
That bit was mildly interesting, at least. No more asking someone "hey, what's your SH pusher build" followed by a ton of typing if I can just _send them the build_.
---
Also gives it a tiny leg up over the ArcDPS build templates, which have been available and fully-functional for a long time now.
---
IMPLYING they will be a total of 60 and not twice or even trice that much LMAO
---
Get real homeboi
---
It does help, if more people leave the game ANet can either stir things up and deliver properly, or NCSoft shut them down because they fail to deliver. Most likely ANet would try to stir things up and deliver properly first
---
Me too plz :)
---
Sounds like my old workplace and the city it was in. My last day walking through my old building and seeing rows of empty cubicles was eerie, I was glad to have gotten out of it
---
Sadly, this game doesn't seem to be going anywhere either...
---
Nooo no no no you do NOT want a roadmap. Game development is not something that can and will not follow a strict schedule, so a roadmap will only set the devs up for more angry comments by the fans when they weren't able to meet a deadline from the roadmap by the second.
---
Trust me, you don't want a road map, anet doesn't want a roadmap, absolutely no one wants a fucking roadmap. It helps no one and guarantees nothing.
---
good that you have a reason to play then
---
Saga and they made a point of saying it's different than the season 5.
---
So yes, he was right.
---
I hate WoW gameplay, so even if I respect it and think it's a quite decent MMO experience, I just can't deal with the gameplay.
---
Also, I'm still salty about many lore changes coming from W3 as a lore nerd, so yeah. Still hoping WoW Classic does great, the MMO genre needs some new blood, even if it's from grumpy old assholes.
---
I mean true, but it is the idea they're going for.
---
There are other games besides MMO's dude. I don't play those other MMO's cuz I only really have time for one right now so I can't comment on those communities. Just I play a lot of other games that get frequent updates and its always "the final betrayal" whenever ANYTHING happens.
---
They said specifically "prologue will be free" directly implying everything else won't be
---
*FUCK YOU BUY OUR HOT TOPIC TSHIRT*
---
oh. i thought it was like... support for switzerland players
---
This is not the time to speak truth, people are very sensitive right now
---
Esports was part of the original concept, was you not playing when this game launched?
---
and which people consider the worst part of the game and a huge controversial subject within the community lol.
---
Knew about Roy but only saw him for a moment. That actually kinda eats me more that Jebro was there. Dude had to travel from europe for just this.  Legit I want to x-files level of believe  he roy and a few other creators are getting side knowledge. We've known about the 10v10 map for awhile Ben has been working on. With swiss out of the way maps would be the next go ahead i'd figure.
---
I mean, if lw5 isn't free i guarantee there will be an immediate 25% drop off of vets.
---
. Narrative maintenance mode is exactly on point. Anet is done.
---
I'm happy for you. That's about the most positive thing I can say about this whole announcement, though.
---
I forget the name it's like star something but it's a black lion chest exclusive
---
I love Malcolm in the Middle so much. What a fantastic show.
---
It was bad, time to wake up buddy!
---
I can't imagine the dissapointment of people that flied to Seattle to hear stuff that could be wrote down in a blog post.
---
I dunno what that question means.
---
Yup yup yup. More of the same is what I expected, more of the same is what we're getting.
---
I don't understand why would it be such a burning problem to begin with.
---
I literally just watched the last dregs of my static disband in discord. Great.
---
While you are correct, this event was purely for the season 5. Tying the elite specs to the season or, by the eternal alchemy, to a specific episode would be pretty idiotic.
---
No I don't think so
---
It's clear from what they said that their intention with the missions is to get more people into raiding, which should be better for raids as a whole. It's fair to be disappointed that they didn't announce any new raid content directly, yes, and it's certainly debateable that strike missions will achieve that goal.
---
But of course the raid community can't be happy about the prospect of new raiders coming in... because they hate new raiders. And then wonder why their community is so small and gets so little content.
---
And yes, I'm saying that as a person who raids pretty avidly these days. I have a static and a guild that I love... but I also believe it's true that the raid community in general is its own biggest enemy. Sometimes the negativity and toxicity that I see make me just want to turn the game off and walk away.
---
He's in the comments here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cmgjxt/greg\_miller\_will\_host\_the\_august\_30th\_living/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cmgjxt/greg_miller_will_host_the_august_30th_living/)
---
The only thing announced for September was the release for the PROLOGUE episode (not even episode 1) on the 17th. So that might be where they are confused. 
---
WvW is still "in the coming months" and even that they said they will be ready to "talk" about it in the coming months, so actually getting stuff in the game is probably even further out.
---

---
ngl i think we are going to have to boycott the game until they release some actual hard content
---
I liked the announcement.. the only problem is  i think the stream with the timer and revealing imagen is creating hype for nothing... they shouldnt have put that.. hyped it too much.
---
There was almost a year between the last few raid releases, should be clear to anyone that they don't have any interest in making them. 
---
Guild wars 2 is a single player story experience, not an mmo. I am willing to bet you my left nut that at least 3 of those teams are all working on LW :)
---
And you're not making any point. They said LW and the mastery was coming, but did you even hear them mention raids or fractals. Pls don't waste my time with such stupid arguments.
---
I mean, they said they weren't working on an expansion when the firings happened. If you expected them to announce one when they would only be in the planning phase at this point if they were indeed working on one. I don't know what to tell you. Thats just unrealistic. Time to go play something else... That's what I did.
---
That is this low rez shit? This looks so bad. 
---
Must be a tier set that gets upgraded.
---
&gt;if they cater to their customers, then probability is that they'll make money from them.
---
Is that why they've ignored feedback for years?
---
No wonder they got fucked with layoffs.
---
Username checks out.
---
tl;dr: op hasn't played gw2 long enough to realise this was worst ever anet move in 7 years.
---
What sad life do you live that when you see someone happy to enjoy something you decide to shit on their excitement?
---
This subreddit represents a small fraction of the community, and you represent an even smaller fraction of the subreddit.  You don't speak for the entire population of the game.
---
Uwah... It sucks =S
---
When they announced it I thought it would be any gemstore armor, not that you get to pick one among a very small set.
---
&gt;absolutely nothing for PvP/WvW
---
I watched it and they said they want to focus on balance which is very PVP oriented.
---
Fully agreed.
---
I can even speak from personal experience, not with GW2 but a bunch of other games years ago. At some point I noticed "Jesus christ I'm getting angry over something that's supposed to be a fun part time thing" and stopped.
---
And this case is even worse. The game is 7 years old. It's probably hard to make people who play the same game for 7 years be really excited about anything. This is supposed to be a hobby, not your whole life. If the content for GW2 leaves you unfulfilled, maybe switch the game, or the whole hobby for a while?
---
So people who don't play PvP, WvW or don't raid are not dedicated players? I liked the announcement. I felt the hype even during the event. I agree that they could have shared more, but maybe they plan to do that in the next couple of weeks.
---
I expected LS5 announcement and got LS5 announcement, so I must agree. People are mad because somehow they expected more, probably using imagination too much.
---
The self aware "one pvp player in the back" joke really really put a nail in the coffin.
---
I'm a collector but not even Nendoroids, so hard pass.
---
Good job on creating a strawman.
---
why dont they just make hardcore content around the map, like e.g put some cool rewards or drops onto some of verdant brinks nightbosses, so people grind to get them, and hope they arent just a fucking skin
---
Not only that, but the prologue takes place in Grothmar (https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Grothmar_Wardowns) which is an iconic location in GW1 adjacent to the Shiverpeaks. This is actually more nostalgic for GW1 players than S3 was in many ways.
---
The trailer also shows Jora's descendant beside Rytlock and Braham, so again another GW1 nostalgia trip.
---
i'm such a casual player and really only play when new story content comes out, so I am pretty excited to have a norn/charr focus!! they've been the most neglected in the story for sure. sylvari will always be my favorite, so i loved all the heart of thorns content being a sylvari, but this new focus is excited to me and I hope they do a good job with it all.
---
Yes. They were announced. That counts. This was an announcement stream. Were you expecting all these things to be released today?
---
One of the reasons 1.0 had such bad performance was because the models were so horribly unoptimized. A flower pot had the same number of polygons as a fully featured human player.
---
The people who are like “why is everyone hating”are the people that play just for the story and nothing more.
---
bought gw1 on release, bought faction ce in release, bought nightfall ce, bought eotn, bought gw2 on release, bought hot on release, bought pof on release
---
So even less content.
---
Guilds isn't why it's called Guild Wars. It's a name from the old guild wars way back in history.
---
Why waste time say lot word when number do trick
---
Because you're using what you and your friends like as proof that people shouldn't be upset.
---
Again, no one cares that you and your friends are happy with what they showed.
---
What? That’s the ideal. It’s typically not possible, but the best possible situation for an mmo game dev would be constant new players that join and drop money and quit. Veterans are just annoying with their constant demands for content. Fortunately a constant influx of new players isn’t typically possible
---
We're content starved.
---
All that's happened is new gemstore items that the casual community KEEPS ON BUYING.
---
I won't buy new cosmetics when there's barely content for me to look at my character doing said content
---
Ye i heard the crowd boo like on diablo immortal -.-
---
So it's basically Drytop 2. I'm honestly fine with this so long as they make the map a little less artificially sectioned off. It'll also fix the abandonment issues of older Living Story maps.
---
shouldnt have made the timer in the first place... inflated hype too much now the dislike is what they get back.
---
By 2027 GW2 won't be a game you'll just log in and have the gem store and that's it.
---
Well... I don't think it's really the release schedule that's the problem. We've had this release schedule since season 3. I think the real problem is the lack of an announced expansion and the uncertainty of the game's future. I haven't spent a dime on GW2 ever since they announced there won't be an expansion between season 4 &amp; 5 and the layoffs earlier this year made me fear the game won't be around much longer after season 5.
---
I know... Babies everywhere now.
---
I'm a bit sleep deprived and really underwhelmed with the announcement. Perhaps once I get some sleep, I'll go into full detail as to why this was an extremely bad move on Anet's part.
---
I'm hearing only good things about them. 
---
Purchased too there without problems, have Pof and hot now. For now I am happy.
---
I don't have a problem with the gem store . It's a pretty decent example of a free game done right. I have a problem with the lazy approach they take to the other parts of the game. Having an announcement to basically show nothing we didn't know, just a fucking trailer , is an example.
---
Exotic gear is fine for raiding. Farm the ascended trinkets in LS maps (Bitterfrost frontier being the best one) and you'll be mostly set for any raid. Enjoy.
---
no u 😉
---
&gt; No one's paying any money for this
---
You're kidding, right?
---
&gt; Source linked below, from press release
---
While the info is most likely true, your claim that there's a source linked somewhere "below" is bullshit.
---
&gt;"Hurrr durrr My expectations were ZERO and i'm still let down.. Booohooo"
---
That in itself is belittling. If this doesn't some like ridicule to you then I don't know what is.
---
I think these new "mini raids" (was "strikes" the name?) is a good start. 
---
Also we got new mounts before (in LS4), that's expansion worth too.
---
🤔 How much money did they spend on those two costumes to have them stand there for 5 minutes and not do anything?
---
Ok
---
They should have just let Ruby host the event. She's great and she at least knows about the game. That guy was awful.
---
i'm just flying over this and thought this was a list from the "blogspot" until i read 2 regular raids...
---
 I didnt know Funko pops  were considered content
---
It’s pretty disappointing for me. I’ve been playing since launch and living world stories/chapters always felt like a chore to me. I don’t enjoy doing them and once I completed a chapter, I never went back. To be honest, I’m not sure if I’ve even completed a full living world season. I’m one of last players in our (one successful) guild that hasn’t moved on but I think that time is fast approaching.
---
Nah theyll just unistall so the money never circulates into the economy
---
The point of having a legendary is to show it off (as well as swap stats and sigils on the fly), not collect dust in the bank. If you'd get more use out of the sword, then go with Bolt.
---
They said that was the purpose of challenge mode Fractals. Then they discontinued those.
---
I actually think strikes could be really good and this games version of Trials or single boss raidwings, but they need a couple of things.
---
They need a difficulty or challenge mode that's fun for the hardcore community as well, seeing that the same team is now most likely going to be responsible for maintaining fractals AND raids AND strikes. If we're getting fewer raids as a consequence of strikes, strikes better offer something to hardcore players as well. 
---
They need their selection of unique rewards. No rewards means no incentive to do them, and since casual players mostly care about rewards you need to actually pull them in.
---
They need to actually replicate raids in that they require healing, aggro management in some way, and have punishing mechanics. If the mechanics don't punish you severely for failing them, Strikes are in no way going to be useful to learn raids. In dungeons and non CM fractals you can already cheese most bosses. Having another mode where that's possible won't help.
---
And most importantly, THERE NEEDS TO BE AN ACTUAL RENEWED FOCUS ON RAIDS. If there's even less raids coming in the future, what's the point of raid easy mode? Casuals won't play it more than a couple of times, and hardcore players won't play it more than a couple of times either if there's no more difficult mode, while so many groups consistently farm raids week after week.
---
Eh, 30+k viewers and 5 codes ... you dind't miss much
---
&gt;"GAME IS DEAD" moment
---
Not so much GAME IS DEAD as GAME IS DYING. They've lost staff, but they haven't made a ton of progress on a lot of the features they started. Despite lessons learned from HoT/PoF, there seems to be no actual worthwhile footage of a next expansion yet, 2 years in. That does not foster confidence. It's a downward spiral, and eventually the people who make the decisions and put in the money are gonna forcefully put the game on life support.
---
They did say Armor Piece, but I expected a much better selection.
---
Saw it
---
Thank you though!
---
yeah important things like selling leggings and peddling boring content
---
also wow is a trash game
---
#Sunk Cost Fallacy
---
Build Templates were announced before the stage thing, training raids are basically instanced bounties, regular story update.
---
Nothing worth hyping up on stage. Literally regular content drop.
---
At least y'all got free pixel shirts
---
I was expecting at least something about new elite specs and some real content regarding pvp and wvw.  
---
For a big announcement, it was pretty lacking.
---
Shield
---
It's not free if you need to have bought PoF to get it.
---
ppl on reddit overhype everything all the time, it's nothing new
---
&gt; Create a roadmap like in StarCitizen
---
I'm so excited for more Norn content but Rytlock punching that other Charr was the hypest shit I've seen in a while.
---
It terms of what I expected, it was almost exactly what I thought it would be. I was hoping there would be a little more about the WvW Alliance than 'few more months' but other than that. I figured it would just be a Living Story reveal. They just hyped it up because it landed near the games birthday.
---
The Chart homelands are north of Ascalon, not east.
---
Who are "people" anyway. People could mean those who enjoy a progressing lore. So then the statement "people shouldn't be upset" is just... absolutely stupid.
---
I know is not the point, but for the casual reader here, the guild wars is named that because of war between guilds that happened before the story of GW 1.
---
When your sarcastic pessimistic futures are still fond dreams, let a man dream.
---
I believe that they're changing arr to not be a grind though?
---
Way to avoid addressing my rebuttal of your extremist nonsense.  But that's pretty typical of this subreddit, can't argue so you'll just shout out the same phrases over and over.
---
soon(tm)
---
Resort to attempts at insults &gt; get's excused &gt; double's down because she didn't get the attention she wanted.   
---
Class act. Pleasure was all mine. Have a lovely day!
---
One more positive I found- the interesting design for that other Charr Rytlock fought with. He's unlike any Charr we've seen ingame! Sleek design, the posture, the voice... it's all very Scar-like. I love it
---
&gt; The game isn't going to thrive if they only focus on story 
---
I wouldn't bet on it.
---
anet do not want to fight other mmo they found their place and they are happy this way.
---
this is a game for a particular type of player and i love it. if u don'tthen just move
---
Arena net : "YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO ANY JOKES ABOUT MINORITIES, 
---
 Unless you are a pvp player then just fuck you, you are a piece of shit"
---
What really make me angry is that pvp population decrease DUE TO ARENANET NOT SUPPORTING IT AT ALL for 3 years.
---
he is just doing what they do best; making strawman arguments :)
---
Yeah, ESO has been pumping out pretty decent content. Rare, good looking mount skins for doing daily quests during an event. Constant free story additions, and still doing expacs. It'd honestly be my main game if the animations/feel wasn't so clunky and that I didn't get 100+ ping to a Texas server while living in Texas.
---
&gt; Am I the only one...
---
Nope, not at all. There were lots of people with stupidly unrealistic expectations.
---
This is more a breaking point for a lot of us.
---
Just 2.1 to 2.5, but thats not coming for 6 to 12 months.
---
"SEATTLE – Aug. 30, 2019 – An ancient power stirring from beneath the ice of the Far Shiverpeaks is the latest threat Guild Wars 2 players will face in The Icebrood Saga, the game’s newest collection of episodic content. Players can get an early taste of the new locations, conflicts, and thrilling story coming to the award-winning MMO on September 17 with the release of the prologue episode, Bound by Blood. The entire Icebrood Saga, including Bound by Blood, will be free for players who own Guild Wars 2: Path of Fire, with Episode One releasing this autumn."
---
They're not charging for Icebrood Saga. Check the official blog post.
---
Thats an extremely large time frame, not really a strong argument
---
You can't be serious right
---
But they showed nothing of how it works.
---
If they haven't learnt by now that Living Seasons cannot work as a replacement of expansions, they will never learn it. Living Season is decent to keep people playing for a short time and to span the time between expansions and form new story arcs but players want and need new content on the level of a new expansion to keep playing the game for longer.
---
Just so much emotional hype for so little to say. I was ready to throw money at Anet. Not buying from poncho hype man from NCsoft. So many other game companies doing the hype right. Backing it up with clear new content. Not things already known. Thank you for 7 years of game play.
---
I think something people need to be reminded of is that Guild Wars 2 is a **MMO.** If story content that's maybe worth 10 hours of gametime is the most important part of the game, than this isn't a MMO, it's a single player RPG.
---
I feel like there are plenty of parallels you can draw though, the timeframe to address community concerns, the distribution of new content to new cosmetic content, the overall amount of communication in general, the frequency of balance patches (which are mostly number tweaks, so the different style of game isn't going to make as much of a difference here).
---
The addition of new, and most importantly, interesting loot, in GW2 every single map is just same old equipment, and a new stat set that gets more and more niche the more they add. Another big thing is that the changes Path of exile make change everything, the league mechanic can be felt throughout the game, the new content is wherever you look. In GW2 they've been adding a new map, so when that runs out of content, that's it.
---
The design and communication ethos of these two companies is night and day, and Anet need to get better at those.
---
Average player with like 4000AP here.
---
It's my opinion.
---
LS5 is expansion level content. Delivered in small pieces.
---
this guy was a fucking waste of air time. people PAID MONEY TO TRAVEL AND LODGE just to watch this asshat suck up 15 fucking minutes of announcement time, or however long he was up there for. it felt like eternity. this felt more like a fucking press conference than an announcement worth going on stage for.
---
Would try but nerfed too hard.
---
from the sounds of it, seems like they're going the way Season 1 went, but with replayablity this time around.  
---
Season 1 had 4 teams, where each team was leading 1 month of content(update every 2 weeks), so each team basically had 4 months to work on their content. And they reused a lot of maps to add stuff, and make smaller content releases more often.
---
I'm playing this game for the story, so if this means more story more often, I'm onboard.
---
Man how are you getting 20-30 hours O_O
---
I had a half day off from the office and felt like I was ‘finished’ with the last episode besides getting a sky scale which is hardly engaging content
---
Its all good, I could have worded my original post better too after re-reading it. Just had a LOT of people say that I'm telling people they aren't allowed to be disappointed or frustrated when that's not what I said...
---
Didn't mean to imply you were, you gave me a respectful well thought out response.
---
Yeah, screw every other game mode just give me my Living World with that good 30 minutes of story missions and collection/daily capped achivement that will take close to a month. I love getting that and only that every 3-6 months. 
---
/thread.
---
mimimimimimimi
---
Ah, the denial stage.
---
because living story has never been fun, so knowing we are getting more and nothing innovative is a death wish for large chunk of the players
---
Arenanet just can't get out of their own way.  
---
There was a brief moment in season 3 when I felt like the story was going in a direction that would actually become interesting and engaging, and then they quickly went back to their regular formula. New story isn't going to be engaging until they start taking larger risks with their story telling.   
---
A few people have already posted speculation that each episode this season may come with a cost, or you'll need a season pass. This will become a nightmare for them if they continue to release content with their infamous quality. Somehow, I've been unlucky enough to be hit by every bug in every episode that has been release. I've learned to not even try to play the episodes until a week after they're released... granted bugs happen, I can handle a few here and there, but every episode!  
---
I've been playing since launch. I keep playing because I like the Guild Wars world and the potential of the story, but Arenanet has a history of abandoning content, and slighting their players. They don't really seem to understand what players want, or how to deliver it when we suggest it. 
---
They're so distracted by being competitive in the market, they've lost perspective on the relationship between the current and potential player base.
---
Or maybe, just maybe, people weren't getting as disappointed as the 20 people here on reddit spamming?
---
Here's what's available with the armor skin voucher [https://i.imgur.com/KJ3Bjzg.png](https://i.imgur.com/KJ3Bjzg.png)
---
^(In case you want to get even more disappointed)
---
Why do you want a legendary? 
---
If it's for the sake of stat-swapping, the skin shouldn't matter since you can apply any skin to it.
---
If it's for the sake of looks, don't buy any if you don't actually like the looks (or never have any use for them).
---
If it's just for the sake of having a legendary....well, there's still [the shining blade](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Shining_Blade), which you can't buy directly, but since you seem to have the funds for buying one directly, you should still get it pretty fast if you used that gold for crafting instead.
---
&gt;Same, I've been highlighting the irony of a studio with such a strong culture of social justice treating certain races in their world, narrative-wise, like a typical Jim Crow proponent.
---
social justice is mostly about virtue signalling, not sure why people don't realise this.
---
Easy mode for Raids after all.. still yikes..
---
Because you hype people up for absolutely nothing, what do you expect? People to be happy about leggings and stuffed toys? lmao
---
O definitely would be amazing.
---
How does that help me, as a customer, directly?
---
Build templates is not an announcement. That announcement was months ago. This is an announcement of an announcement we already heard, with no dates or actual preview.
---
WvW alliance is also not an announcement. That announcement was almost 2 years ago. Also no dates or preview.
---
PvP swiss tournament is not an announcement. That was mentioned in 2018. No dates or preview.
---
Any kind of social content is not mentioned. Last fractal was in January. Raids take 9 months to release with uncertain future. Guild mjssions have been the exact same since 2013. Guild halls have had zero development since HoT. Strike missions sound cool until you realise that getting 1 boss every 3 to 4 months results in exactly the same problem with raids and fractals.
---
"Expansion-level features" in living world are their words, not the community's, but I'm not seeing what those features are. There are no new features, it's just more of the same.
---
I'm sure if you actually tried you can get some logic and empathy, but I'm not convinced you will be.
---
The trailer is cool so that's something, and I enjoy the story for what it's worth.
---
&gt; Misused
---
No not really, its used exactly on point with the way most people who identify with the term think and act. When you say "neoliberal" people have a certain image and ideology that go hand in hand associated with it.
---
Saying "ackchyually its an economic ideology" is like saying "ackchyually hitler was a socialist he even named his movement after it".
---
I see. I started with Gw2 so I was not aware of that
---
Some people enjoy getting clothes for Christmas, you know?
---
Not me, tho. I only ever liked getting Lego as a kid.
---
Keep your bar low bois, never be disappointed.
---
So don't make bolt, make shining blade.
---
There's 2 legendary swords.
---
wow has done this for ages and you also pay a sub fee, so who would even care? I don't and you also don't but just want to farm to some sweet sweet internet points, bitch.
---
Ah, so may have been me mis-reading the room. I can definitely understand people being concerned, I just may have jumped to conclusions a bit.
---
Because GW2 has had a history of overhyping and overpromising content, and then failing to deliver. And even when they do, it's incredibly late, or incomplete.
---
What if I had unsubscribed a year ago.
---
That doesn't mean anything. It's a lot easier to add new content for players that doesn't involve having to balance/optimize against other players. With WvW they are touching a huge chunk of existing code/infrastructure and have to ensure it works within the confines of players playing against other players. miles more difficult than adding a bunch of PvE content.
---
I mean, we don't even know what kinds of requirements were given to devs, what effect the layoffs had on that team, what vacations/holidays/sicknesses effected them, etc. I take this as "We're still working on it, but no new information to report".
---
There is a lot more that goes into development than you're implying. Code isn't magic and sure as hell doesn't do what I expect it to do all the time, *especially when I'm working with legacy code.*
---
"But none of all these absolutely unrealistic expections were announced! Game has to be dead now!"
---
&gt; Screw these raiders and pvp/wvw players crying that they got nothing again!
---
Funny thing is *the got*! Raiders will get a new kind of (easier) raids, literally the easy mode they asked for. PvP player will get the swiss tournament and WvW... to be fair I didn't listen there, because I don't play WvW, but they talked about WvW. xD
---
I'd rather get a shitty trailer for a good chunk of content than the other way round..
---
Thanks for playing :(
---
&gt;What did you people expect,
---
"We will be working on new raids, new dungeons, and new challenge motes that will put your skills to the test that you hone in squad strike. Guild Wars 2 is a game about playing together, and we look forward to seeing players work together in teams to overcome these big challenges."
---
"To overcome these new challenges, we will be introducing new powers, new tools, and new specs. Living World Season 5 will see the premiere of NEW elite specializations! Please have a look at this trailer."
---
"... but that's not all. You may have noticed an Engineer using Spirit Weapons.  I am proud to announce our most groundbreaking feature yet: SECONDARY PROFESSIONS!!!!!!!"
---
"With all these new tools at the player's disposal, we are also introducing a new feature that will put their skills to the test. We have dungeons, we have raids, we have squad strikes. And now.. ELITE open world zones! Where you can find the hardest world bosses in the game!"
---
"With all these new challenges awaiting, we have created a new place for guilds to hall home. Please have a look at our new Norn and Charr-themed guild halls!
---
"Speaking of guilds, we have one last feature coming to show you today..  \*trailer\*   WE ARE PROUD TO ANNOUNCE GUILD CAPES COMING TO GUILD WARS 2!!!!! THANK YOU, EVERYONE!!! I'LL BE SEEING YOU AGAIN SOON!!!!!"
---
&gt; training raids are basically instanced bounties
---
Oh, you've played them already? Fantastic, I'm sure you can tell us all of the details about how they work.  
---
Or are you vomiting back the shit you pulled out of your ass and treating it like the truth?
---
&gt; Armor Piece
---
Missed that part. I was just expecting the core old as hell gemstore armour (which, discounted, cost around the same anyway).
---
This... I already have the single skin that's neat so I use it, a couple that I bought on large discount but don't use and shouldn't have bought anyway, and the rest I won't be using anyway.
---
HOT TAKE ALERT!!! I don't think he did.
---
If I wanted to play episodic story releases I would play Life is Strange (the newest episode is weird).
---
* Build Templates coming soon  
---
Since 2015, yeah.
---
A+ 11/10 for premonition
---
Just leave man.  
---
They don't owe any of that to you or other people.   If you have a list of demands for something you used to enjoy to complete the mental gymnastics into thinking you can restore the novelty of the game with a few changes, you're not going to have a good time on the game, even if they do meet your demands.  You're done with the game, it's time to move on.
---
Well I'm excited for a lot of stuff mentioned, but yea this really didn't need the MASSIVE HYPE behind it. A blog post or something like that would have suited this much better. I get wanted to hype up your game Arenanet but... jeez. This was a misstep.
---
It's been YEARS mate, nobody has the "understanding" anymore because it never fucking ends. All this hype to annouce a LW TEASER, not even a trailer, TEASER.   
---
Absolutely shameful even if it was fucking 10 people working there
---
That OP had to dig up a YouTube comment shows that the toxic casuals has nothing left to use against us.
---
I don't know how you can say they don't care when Strike Missions seem to be pretty transparently an attempt at FFXIV trial-like content
---
This, dear kids, it's bargaining phase. A person tries to convince themselve they're not going to die.
---
Then you should do a bit of research because DE's bullshit is driving even the content creators away \[and these people, the Partners, are officially endorsed by DE and they're STILL leaving because DE simply doesn't listen to feedback and take way too long to deliver anything\].
---
The guys in my guild were making fun of him so hard, felt so bad and disgusted over it. He's free to wear whatever he wants.
---
Yeah, the game is about dragons, so of course it's a big part. I think it is fine since each dragon is so unique. Like, come on - Heart of Thorns did not feel like a normal dragon. If it wasn't called a dragon in game people would not even have known, they'd think it was some weird mind-controlling jungle snake.
---
And then you also seem to ignore that the latest xpac was about a god, not a dragon. Sure it eventually got to dragons, but it wasn't the initial plot - they took a detour from the whole dragon story. Oh, and a big plot about mummies. It really isn't only about dragons, the bigger picture is because that is what the game is about.
---
It's like complaining that Harry Potter is all about Potter vs Voldemort. It really is not, there is so much else in that story, but of course the overall goal is to defeat voldemort, like GW2 in the end is about dragons.
---
They literally said Drakkar is a world boss, not a raid. Pay attention, youtube
---
That's definitely an unfortunately large subculture but Social Justice as a whole isn't just virtue signalling
---
It's not something great, yeah. Something new to farm for but that's about it.theres the swiss tourney thing, but the mATs work yet? Mostly pvp myself and that stream was overall meh
---
Announced it 2 months ago, told us the content in it has been planned for more than a year, promised expansion-like features with LS5 back when it was announced, added ingame teasers for it, sends consistent reminders for it, hires a theatre for it, creates a 48 hour timer for it slowly counting down, etc.
---
Inb4 'AnEt DIdnT hYpE aNYthInG pLayERS arE Dumb'
---
That's a weird way to say "lordkrall", but hey, not that I would expect twitch to know people who type and not run mouth.
---
&gt; "Season 5 will have expansion-like features"
---
They never said that, but okay. ;)
---
Also expansion worth stuff already started with LS4 mounts.
---
Does everyone get that? Or just people who currently have HoT?
---
Your first time watching gaming convention stream? They dont do roadmaps in e3 stages either.
---
It's riding a wave of public opinion. I'm pretty invested in the community. The hardcore veterans are hemorrhaging just as GW2 players were several years ago. They can course correct, however it really is a snapshot into GW2 past.
---
They're also better at putting up stopgaps (roadmap, community interaction) and marketing.
---
In a better game, joko would have had a challenge mote that brought him to raid boss levels of difficulty.
---
I hope it was 10 hours and not barely a third of that per chapter.
---
I really hope that part of "going back to old content" includes reworking more story bosses into incursions.
---
All that time spent in models and skills wasted on fights most people only experience once.
---
So in other words, what they didn't announce. 
---
Who's upset by Build Templates, the Blood Legion Homelands nor the Far Shiverpeaks? What's upsetting is that they made no mention of anything we were looking forward to that wasn't already expected from a new living world chapter. Barely any mention of PvP or WvW. No mention of Raids nor Fractals (that "raidlike" thing? Nobody's upset by it but it's not raids, it's open world it looks like).
---
This update is dildos.
---
That's what I'm talking about. :P
---
I play plenty of story based games really, GW2 is just the only mmo outside of runescape's great quests that have piqued my interest :D
---
&gt;Or are you vomiting back the shit you ate out of your ass and treating it like the truth?
---
No, that's what you are doing whenever idiots like you decide to lick Anet's balls.
---
You're always welcome to play Rift or Wild Star, NCSoft's other published titles... Oh wait...
---
Point being, again, that I'm not defending ANet in terms of the content that was presented. It was bad... But it's also a company's best interest to diversify if they want to grow. A camera company that makes cameras really well will always just be a camera company if they never try something new. ArenaNet will always be the Guild Wars company if they don't try something else. For devs, that's their job yes, but it gets tiring after awhile and a quality drop is guaranteed. 
---
NCSoft was in the wrong to close off the other projects. If ANet really was bleeding money, then it was likely a sink or swim scenario in which they'd either prove that they're a game development company instead of just a Guild Wars company, or they'd have failed.
---
With Guild Wars being one of the last MMOs on NCSoft's roster making money, they probably had a knee-jerk reaction and over-reached.
---
This is all just speculation on my part, but knowing how business and the gaming industry work leaves me scratching my head at how anyone can think NCSoft is ever the good guy in this situation.
---
Hey, Birdo was a gem!
---
I actually praise the pvp in this game as beeing really well done, and encourage ppl play this game just for the pvp
---
Looks cool! Will have a reason to jump in game soon.
---
yeah sure, the only thing I want to do after seeing the announcement is giving them more money
---
You changed your desktop just so you could show reddit that you uninstalled GW2.
---
Man.
---
&gt;Because it sthe ffing subreddit of Guild Wars 2. If you want to talk about how in other ways life can be great add me on Facebook and we can do it, but that does not change the fact that if I'm invested in something I will be disappointed if it's mediocre at best. I won't say, oh fine, life is good anyway.
---
At least make it a proper torso skin so we can mix and match it...
---
They could also section off content itself. Silverwastes originally launched with just a tug-of-war system between us and the Mordrem. The episodes unlocked some minor new sections that were tied to a jumping puzzle or the storyline, but the main map content added major events like the Breach and the Vinewrath. I could imagine them doing the same here. Give us 90% of the map and events to start Episode 1, and Episode 2 introduces a few important locations, big events, and especially the Drakkar world boss fight.
---
Did you also read through the old AMAs on Reddit and on the forums? And watched the WvW streams where they also made promises? Etc. However many excuses you may give for it, it doesn't make things any better.
---
We're in the middle of nowhere with no GPS and dwindling food supplies and Anet just shone a light 10ft into the fog and said "hey it's all cool, we're committed to keeping the lights on!"
---
Okay. Great. Where are we going?
---
Complaining is a valid form of criticism and does far more to help the game than those who defend Anet regardless of their fuckups.
---
Sad thing is I’m a vet and own all:/
---
Everyone CONSTANTLY asks for more communication, but when they actually do it, everyone whines about it. I admit... the timer was a bit too long for the content they were announcing. But I think the people that feel "betrayed" were expecting WAY too much to begin with. It was a Living World announcement... not a 3 hr AMA on how to improve every aspect of the game.
---
I guess time will tell, huh?
---
Basically. This was possibly Anet's largest effort at creating hype since, what, HoT?
---
All I wanted was to hear if the release schedule was staying the same. I don't really find interest in the 2-3, sometimes 5 month gaps between bits of content that stays relevant for a few weeks to a month.  I need something quicker to keep my attention on this game. I don't need a new map each release, just story and content that comes with the release.   
---
On a side note, Jormag's Voice was sweet nectar to my ears. Can he DM all my future DnD sessions?
---
Make it "months".
---
Because it's more important for him to post his opinion, and less important to participate in a discussion. It's a ego thing.
---
because wvw has been coming soon for like a year no new news to cheer for there.
---
I think... no game company would actually come out and say that. PR is there to minimize damage, not maximize it. As a parent, you wouldnt say "jeremy, I like your sis elizabeth more", but anyone could tell that your rugged jeans are nothing to the 3rd princess dress this month of her. Soooooo I think thats the case with Jeremy WvW, PvP and raids, while Casual Elizabeths go about their day. 
---
The only reason they bring up stuff like that is because this community keeps asking for it, endlessly. Maintenance mode is never fun for the players. 
---
Ok, I see that stance, but isnt that more or less a... problem of the hardcore players? Heightened expections of something that will never come out? And then being dissapointed? Creating challenging hardcore content takes way too much effort without making it extremely grindy, hence theres only either abandoning/slowing it down or making it very grindy (at what point you can hear the reddit posts writing itself). And Gw2 has been showing in what directions its spinning itself, and that announcement was that. 
---
So yeah, technically I share your point. Hardcore player dont get anything, they complain (a lot). But what has that to do with a freaking roadmap? It wont share anything but "yeah jeremys on hold, Elizabeth gets the good stuff" over and over.
---
They are amazing, you can buy them and then pretend you are playing the game. So much thought was put into their reveal. Now you can be Aurene!
---
This armor is so...whelming.
---
Nice so it will be around 4h in game content, or am i too generous?
---
I was stuck on gen one legendaries myself as the gen twos seemed daunting. I decided the bite the bullet last week and made The Shining Blade. Totally worth it and to me it looks so much better than Bolt. It took about a week, but it was fun completing Masteries and doing events.
---
When the merch guy came out, I thought he was wearing a cape, and was going to announce capes in game. By that point I guess I was just grasping for straws, only to let myself down further, and I don't even care about capes!
---
At this point, I feel like I would have been happy if they announced new tattoos for Norns.
---
Their big reveal for the forseeable feature ended with spvp getting cosmetic skins. The same info we knew for WvW since last year. EZ mode Raids when people waited 9 months for wing 7 which was the easiest wing they had ever done. So content thats even easier than that. Dumb story content and wrapping everything up by plugging merc so people can buy leggings and funko pops. Yeah can really see how the leggings fit into the living story model.
---
"you know a new raid is coming in the future"
---
No, we don't. And besides that the latest wing is a fucking joke. If that's where raids are headed they'll lose most of their current raiders.
---
&gt; I really think that in the next few months we will continue to get more  information on things like Elite Specs, WvW Alliances, pvp updates, etc 
---
Just don't do this to yourself. Don't become one of these people that got their hopes and then got their hearts broken.
---
2 more hours of content every 4 months here we GOOOOOOOO!
---
The host who was fired by Anet? Or I missed someone?
---
&gt;can't argue so you'll just shout out the same phrases over and over.
---
Indeed, that IS what you white knights do. Can't argue against the truth, so you demonize everyone that tells it and praises Anet like they're Gods of the gaming industry when they were so filled with garbage that NCSoft had to step in and put them in place.
---
Expansion level content is literally what anet said they were going to deliver with season 5
---
Never said you weren't but 6 months ago or so people were bitching that GW2 was silent about future content. Now that they are trying to reverse that people are bitching about how they do it. Can't they get some points fir trying to do better at least.
---
Joko was a fun and creative villain. I wish they did more with him.
---
#**FUCK YOU BUY OUR HOT TOPIC TSHIRT DAMNIT**
---
Well said. The story is pure trash, 30 minutes of unstoppable cutscenes and pressing f here and there. I'm sorry but to me, this is not "good gameplay" or even why I play the game. If I wanted a good storyline I'd go read a book.
---
Aren't you? This much content will last for years. So many new things even though unitiated eye might not see it but it is all there I promise.
---
Recording guild chat episode live on stage is hardly an improvement
---
The main problem with FFXIV being so terrible was that if it remained terrible it would be a lot harder for Squaresoft to ever push out another MMO for their world-renown IP. They doubled down and brought the quality way up and as a result they've not only restored the faith of those disappointed but they proved with action that they were willing to invest into improving their games.
---
What even are you?  
---
Always hype for clothes.  
---
Socks especially!
---
Can i have your stuff?
---
PvP'ers quitting are absolutely justified but that doesn't make it come across any less pathetic when you say a tongue in cheek joke made by a non Anet employee is what caused you to gave up on a game you've likely played for years lol.
---
How to lose your fan base in a nutshell. Lost touch with player base... This is sad. Rip gw2.
---
Silver linings do not stop storms.
---
And there we are, the classic 'It's not ANet's fault, they didn't hype anything, the players did it!!1!'
---
Having rewarding, diverse activities is important to the game's health.  Even if you don't raid or pvp, the decline of those game modes adversely affects the game as a whole.
---
Im not sure how that's relevant? Thats not even sunk cost fallacy since he would be making the logical *choice* of playing another MMO due to investment. Sunk cost fallacy would only be valid if the game he is playing was obviously detrimental to him or objectively bad, but thats impossible since taste is subjective in the first place.
---
That feels awfully limiting given that it is an expandimg medium that can allow for different methods of storytelling. There's a lot of worldbuilding that cannot be organically written into a book but can be done so easily in an interactive setting.
---
what a fucking joke. taking over the Moore for THIS?
---
Listen to our friendliest community. Everyone who does group content is toxic and they don't need us. They are the majority, they are those who buy the gems.
---
If they're trying to attract views and new players they literally fucked themselfs over. Unless they don't care about the game that much that sth like this would bother them, they gonna still look into forums/reddit for guides/help or anything in that direction and i see all this hate and disappointment.
---
He's complaining that it's not the right kind of complaining going on. We gotta diversify, just like anet by selling Tshirts with a tiny choya on em.
---
Imagine playing a game with a badly written and poorly executed story as the main motivator.
---
It was pretty much everything I was expecting it to be but most people didn't keep their expectations realistic. It was always going to be just a Living Story reveal and nothing more, it didn't need a big reveal but I think they wanted to do something big to tie with the fact that the game just had their bday. I can understand why people are upset even though I don't share the feeling. They put all their hopes and expectations into this, there was a lot of 'Anet has to put this thing in there or the game is dead' discussion. They really needed this to be the reveal that proves to themselves and everyone that the game could still be what they wanted it to be and they didn't want the realistic outcome. It sucks but it is what is, I'll keep playing but I hope the people who do leave have fun elsewhere.
---
In a better game, Joko being an incredibly powerful undead Lich would have been used as more then a crutch to bring Aurene back from the dead in the most uninspirational, most obvious "plot twist" in the history of video games.
---
In a better game, Joko might have been brought back as a theme for a raid wing with him standing as a final boss for one or even two, not entirely unlike Qadim.
---
In a better game, Joko could have done lots of things and been used in lots of better ways. But sadly, this is not a better game, and here we are. Praise Joko.
---
I think they showed us less than they should (could?) have. It’s obvious from what we did get to see that there’s high production value - that trailer was awesome, and it’s clear they are putting in a lot of work. It’s just highly unfortunate they held back on most of the juicy stuff until PAX or the announcement of the actual first episode of the prologue, because that’s were the meat of the content will likely be. Remember the emphasis they put on the prologue being free? If the actual episodes end up costing gems/money, chances are that’s where we’ll be getting stuff like new elite specs. They’ll **have** to give us something in addition to what they have been giving us with living world so far, otherwise noone will buy it.
---
That's par for the course for the Anet marketing team, honestly. Occasionally they have good ideas like the HoT animated trailer, but most of the time they make things like the live action launch trailer and the taxi cab...*thing.*
---
No, it needs content.
---
We missed you!
---
I remember someone mentioning how hilarious it would be if the misogynistic Sons of Svanir were worshipping a female dragon this whole time without realizing it a few days ago.
---
How about watching a movie? Is that also useless for you?
---
What? You wanted actual new features like elite specializations, mounts and races? That's entitlement. You should play and pay for cosmetics and be happy. Be happy!
---
Well, not the first time they do something like that.
---
But they won't look as good as [Mini Gwen Doll](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gwen_Doll) did in GW2. Just look at that thing.
---
If you think it's too slow you haven't reached endgame in the last four years.
---
You're kind of right
---
Strike missions will be the same thing for raids that fractals was dungeons. Death.
---
Yeah and LS is barely marketed when a newb buys expacs, so feels kinda misleading when they don't get all story content.
---
Game is not dying. It's just focused on casuals. 
---
Get over it or move on, it's simple as that. People expecting hard instanced content and pvp are NOT the focus of anet.
---
This game needs a new direction to stop its death
---
No, you're also forgetting to kill each lane's mobs a billion times.
---
No they are fucking not. Soon is not a reality.
---
That was underwhelming...I mean if they had to announce only that then they could have done on stream. The wvw part specially with "in the coming months "..jesus awkward.
---
I was gutted to see that the joko final instance wasn't scaled up to dungeon level or mini raid content.
---
Everything was there, numbers needed tweaking and some forced timing mechanics introduced. -sighs- 
---
Tie joko's staff and a bunch of reskinned awakened stuff to that r_r
---
Oh wow, well its not like its a great outfit I guess.
---
They talked about bringing expansion worth content, yes. I never denied that. But they never said this sentence "*Season 5 will have expansion-like features*".
---
Even though you might think "it's the same", it's not.
---
Unless of course you’ve played since the beginning. 
---
I’ve spent thousands of hours in game over the past 7 years, even with months taken away from the game. And I can honestly say that I now just sit my ass in WvW because it actually changes. 
---
Yeah, I play new content when it releases but you can’t honestly tell me there’s more than maybe 28 hours of gameplay with each LS release at max? That’s 2 hours a day for a week and then content runs dry. 
---
I’m glad there’s enough content for you. But there’s no reason to start into the “you have no lives so you don’t count” bullshit arguments. It’s hand waving a problem with the game away as if it’s no big deal.
---
This.
---
I rather press F to repair fences. That's top quality gameplay!
---
WvW has the issue that people can move to the winning side, as they please, whenever. It makes communities unstable and impossible to keep; and action increasingly more rare. 
---
Also pretty much all the elitist quit. If there's nobody making groups for fractals or raids; it's because people can't be bothered making them. Nobody is stopping anyone. Instead we notice that when these "elitists" eventually quit the content gets done even less; and training groups / low barrier raids get more difficult to find also as the scene dies out. WvW is no different.
---
Well, I missed the announcement stream because I was getting lost (and having fun) in classic WoW's Wailing Caverns dungeon for 3 hours.
---
That's fine. I have no problem with that. There's plenty of cosmetic focused games out there. However, they're not very clear about it.
---
Also it IS A BLOG POST: https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/the-icebrood-saga-begins-september-17/
---
I'm genuinely very critical of ANet and their goings on but like... this was a net gain for them. Reddit circlejerk cannot for the life of itself parse it is *not the majority*- most of the people in my 200+ Guild are super hyped for the new announcements. *I'm hyped for the new announcements* and I have been on the "tf is ANet doing train" for longer than most people have been playing GW2.
---
A lot of them set *good* precedent for the game's health/growth as well. We already knew QoL stuff was coming but that's because *we play the game*- talkinging build templates on stage etc on stage is for the benefit of audience members who may have played in the past but quit, or people who don't keep up with blogposts and wait for big announcements like this one.
---
And I *know* everyone is fucking memeing the figures, the clothing etc but for real: if larger brands like Funko and even smaller/more specialized merchandising groups like Insert Coin are partnering with GW2, it means those companies believe in the financial viability of partnering with ArenaNet on merchandise. That speaks a *lot* about the health/popularity of the game itself that they've been able to secure multiple partnerships with merchandising groups the last few months. *(It doesn't hurt that Aurene's figure is pretty cute!)* Arenanet is modernizing their out of game monetization/merchandising to match with other MMOs in the industry which means a.) they are financially in a place to do so and b.) they're reluctantly leaving their island of how they do things.
---
Also... strikes being basically Babby Raids is going to be *so good* for the fucking raiding scene. I absolutely understand hardcore players wanting more content now, but I hiiiiighly doubt whatever raid content they're working on is ready yet. And that's *fine*. One of the biggest struggles with getting into GW2 raiding has traditionally been the curve in difficulty as well as gearing. Creating almost FFXIV trial-like content to help hook players into 10-man PVE will invariably improve the health/population of the overall raiding scene, which in turn will make creating raid content more viable.
---
I know hearing vague "WvW/PvP stuff is coming!" is exhausting. Fuck me I wanna know when my world is gonna be doodad dead etc. But they mention it because they don't want the alternative to happen where people go "no mention LUL DEDGAME". It's a wip, they're still working on it and want to make that clear.
---
Folks are underestimating how important HoT and PoF being together is, too. It's good for new players sure, but a HUGE part of that is that they can now include mastery content from those expansions in all/any things they do going forward. That's actually excellent.
---
I know folks went in expecting like, an expansion's worth of content from a 30min panel but... honestly, this was a good use of their time to pique people's interest and get folks excited for the game. I love PvE and WvW (and miss dungeons like a motherfucker) but ultimately that is such a smallllll piece of their playerbase. I fully anticipated this announcement to be systems, new player stuff and story-related because *fashionwars, story players and more casual players are their primary playerbase*. That said: I do hope they examine how they do content announcements going forward in general and make PvE/WvW/PvP announces more grandiose as well.
---
They should have added one of those new skritt bonds as option
---
I mean it's Greg Miller, he doesn't play GW2, probably hasn't since he reviewed it. He's a Podcaster and I doubt has stuck a pinky toe into any GW2 content in the last forever.
---
Sorry you got upset, but I wouldn't care about someone's opinion if they weren't actually a part of the community.
---
"buh buh buh muh raids and WvW uwu"
---
Raids and WvW are PvE, get over it
---
And PvP is hitting 2 buttons and killing someone. Wow, good job. Go play a different game if you're gonna complain lol
---
Ok cool thanks, I'll try to make a few groups and advertise more.
---
Hire a Community Manager to keep in touch with us and build a bridge of communication between the playerbase and the company, this should be a top priority or else the game is doomed. A CM can let anet know what we think about every aspect of the game in order to improve it. You CAN'T make this game pleasant without hearing what pleases people! And in order to sell stuff and make money, the game needs to be pleasant and worth spending your time into.
---
I sometimes ran dungeons on EU, I put on LFG and 3 mins after the group is filled and we run it.  
---
Never had problems. People who complain are eihter NA or casuals.

We talked about wanting to release expansion level stories and features over the next couple years. Our goal is to create powerful moments like the final instance of this episode that are a culmination of multiple departments and raise the bar for what it means to be a Guild Wars 2 experience."
---
Gah, what a shame. I stopped playing a few months ago and was looking forward to something cool that would bring me back.
---
Oh well
---
&gt; Strike Missions are a good idea
---
Yeah, but whether or not they get immediately abandoned once there’s no more content to recycle is the real question.
---
Like new dungeons/fractals.
---
Was there any news about deep sea dragon? No? Welp, let me know when there is!   
---
Also, I miss malcolm in the middle lol
---
To be fair, that is what misogyny is like IRL. It is usually over petty shit like "girls reject me".
---
The enemies have been the same since pretty much release. Open world is a joke with no difficulty whatsoever.
---
Greg Miller probably hasn't touched GW2 since he reviewed it at launch.
---
Greg Miller is entirely unnecessary
---
Unless your team demands it, you really only need to worry about ascended accessories and weapons.  
---
Armor offers the lowest stat increase over exotic gear and costs the most to level and craft
---
A weak elder dragon is still an elder dragon... Those things aren't exactly easy to deal with, especially when we lost their known weakness. He went back to pre-awakening levels, but we don't know how far into that he was (e.g. 90% to awakening vs 50% to awakening) and with 4 dragons instead of 6, he could be getting more magic than before. So either way, Jormag is going to wake back up, putting him at "awakening" levels of power, which is still enough to be a threat.
---
Also, it is unclear how much Balthazar drained them. I think it might have been that he just used their energies against each other, meaning he didn't get any. He was waiting to kill the dragons to absorb their energy when they died, which didn't happen so he went after Kralk. He might have gotten some energy from that, but he didn't seem any stronger in PoF than he was post-Bloodstone. And if most of Primordius's energy was sent to Jormag, we don't really know what would happen long-term. Even if it is their weakness, they might be able to use that energy like Kralk used Zhaitan. Or perhaps they'd expel it and it would just work its way back to the other dragon...
---
Either way, no reason Jormag can't be an antagonist or a threat. I mean, did you really think S3 resolved them completely? It just put em on ice for a bit =P
---
They've had 7 years to do them
---
To be fair, some cultures actually use a shaking head to mean agreement... It's very confusing learning to work with that.
---
does anyone have a link to the supposed statement from anet that this new living story would feature "expansion-worthy content"? i can't seem to find it, but i do vaguely recall something along those lines being said
---
My problem too.  Quit stringing us along like you're going to care or eventually care about things like WvW.  Just drop it like you did with dungeons so people can move on.
---
If they want to just purely make this game about casual open world PvE with lore and story tied to it, then fine.  Just don't keep telling me something is coming or that you "hear" me when you really don't.
---
What is EvE Online.
---
LOL
---
To the top with this.
---
I actually enjoyed the count down screen of stream more!
---
Unfortunately the story is fucking garbage ever since PoF.
---
You got the kung Fu tea promo to work? Huh. I never did. 
---
Found my new favorite overprived bubble tea place though.
---
Event planner plant people in the crowd to be enthusiastic and cheer to get other people pumped up. It was pretty obvious with this even when the same 5 voices screamed every time and the rest of the crowd had luke warm applause.
---
I thought there'd be actually armors to select from, as they say on their show. 
---
Now it's only 1/6th of an armor. I'm disappointed.
---
When did they say September? They said "coming months", only thing for September is the Prologue.
---
Most cash shop stuff in FFXIV is just event items from previous years.
---
If a single individual can keep someone against a corner it would not be done right. It would have to be something like 3 people against a corner, so you can see them coming, and so they have to expose their backs when facing the cornered player, and 2 people only if it's on the sides of a narrow corridor. But no maps have corridors narrow enough anyways.
---
Dude! didn't you see that PvP is getting a new armor set! How does that not bring you back to full play time?
---
Yeah, Op is literally fishing for reasons to be upset on this one.
---
And I don't get why, there's tons to be upset about, but this joke isn't one.
---
Didn't she brainwash them with toxins or something? I wasn't aware she literally did it through the power of friendship lol
---
Yeah, strange that "people" talked about it *while raiding*. 
---
These strange casuals that stealth into 500li+ groups and doing full clears, right? :P
---
&gt; that IS what you white knights do
---
Classic dude, you really got me with that one! "I know you are but what am I?" You're so clever.
---
&gt; the truth, so you demonize everyone that tells it
---
Dead games don't get new content.  You're lying if you call GW2 a dead game.  Pretty simple to me.
---
&gt; praises Anet like they're Gods of the gaming industry
---
I don't, but when people are saying that a new content release is "being fucked in the ass" I'm going to call them on that bullshit.
---
Yeah exactly. I'm pretty sure the people who do fractals and raids and daily's every day are keeping the population up as much as or more than the casuals.
---
Don't get me wrong, this game needs both. But forgetting about and eventually losing the hardcore players isn't going to be good for the game.
---
Maybe when they hyped it up they forgot about their strict NDA, which kicked in and caused them to not be able to announce anything new past the prologue.
---
The ascalonian buildings and the charr structures on top are new assets though ? They're more polished, new takes on the old stuff. Yes, a lot of the plants and shrubbery are reused but that didn't seem to bother you with Melandru's Area reusing a ton of HoT assets ?   
---
Other than that, the area is supposed to be plains / savannah based on GW1, and I think they're pretty good on that.   
---
The desert has more contrast bc it's a desert, that's how it is IRL too. Melandru's Island is brimming with life to an absurd amount bc it's a god realm.
---
When are we supposed to get these?
---
&gt; You are destroying the viability of MMOs by being entitled impatient kids who can't make fun for yourself
---
If I could design my raids I would.
---
Movies are fine but don’t give the same immersion into a story as a game (or I assume as a book would.)
---
Yeah promoting the game makes sense, but it's clear their game direction is out of sync with *a lot* of their community and it has been for a long time. People were hoping the hyped announcement was a reveal that showed a course correction but here we are with them repeating the same unsatisfying strategy of content we've seen the last couple of years. It's just not enough.
---
Market the game good or bad, it doesn't matter when the game is a shallow puddle of content that is evaporating in the sun for a large number of players.
---
We found this in our folder for comics based on the new elite specs.
---
~~first there have to be any hot female devs~~
---
Opps, you are right.  I had forgotten about The Legions of the Charr story that added that.
---
\+ also want to say special thanks to Novera for offering probably the most insight in this entire announcement put together. She actually sounded like she loves this game as much as we do.
---
I wish we would get new content that we could rush or grind...
---
Story mode is no fun.
---
GW2 is no fun.
---
Anet has sacrificed an expansion to offer us a new living season with "expansion-level" features, massively hyped the event for this "expansion-level" lw5, and then announces a generic episode, with no "expansion-level" features, no expansion in sight, and possibly no hope for new elite specs to ever come out.
---
Meanwhile, FFXIV, which has been releasing new expansions at about the same rythm as GW2 in the past, just released its third - and possibly best - expansion, it's getting better, it's growing, and all Anet has to offer to compete with it is... whatever little they have shown.
---
Hmm, maybe I was too hasty and hot-headed (it doesn't help that I did buy HoT in May when I began playing, so I only enjoyed it for 3 months instead of 4 years).
---
I heard them say Armor Piece at the show, but was hoping for a better selection.
---
Is the English VA actually male or is it supposed to be a "tough granny" voice in contrast to Glint's very soft and sometimes frail-sounding tone, with a load of reverb effects piled on?
---
"Living saga"
---
While i can kinda get where you are coming from with this,   
---
I do not thing this is a right course of action. Something like this devalues the core game by a pretty large margin. Would probably cause a divide in players as well. Well, more of one. 
---
With the things you are suggesting, I can certainly see people seeing this as a "Oh I Have to do this to keep up," type of thing. You're probably right, there are folks who would pay it. Though the opposite is also true.
---
So what if I got the mail about this and it was empty? No bonuses for me.
---
Are you kidding me? For years we've been waiting for content. Anet doesn't listen and will never listen. I am OUTRAGED that this doesn't come with updates for the most sustaining, most profitable gamemodes (that being WvW, PvP, Raids). We DESERVE and DEMAND more out a f2p model without a monthly subscription. This is unacceptable. Getting this item isn't even tied to a fun meta event with stupid profitable rewards that blow other activities out of the water. We've been asking for outfits obtainable   /s
---
Smoke selling extraordinaire, ladies and gentlemen.
---
Can't disagree, logically. Realistically, though, the monologue *could* have impact if commander *had* a character to begin with. All mine did was glaring with a kinda disgrunted facial animation during that and that's about it. But I see what you mean now - exactly *implications* were important, potentially, but *in effect* the monologue wasn't impactful. Neither of us is wrong, actually, because it did just fell flat in the end due to mistreatment on different fronts.   
---
And yes, that does go back into my point of "you write stories around characters". We could have Braham overcoming loss rather than annoying hissy bitching he got us, we could have Rytlock reflecting on the fact that in order to reignite his favorite sword he kind of unchained Balthazar, whoops (fact that nobody mentions, but entire Elonian tragedy is actually his fault because kitty wanted glowy sword owo), we could have Taimi actually showing that her condition does anything to her ("show, don't tell" - major thing too), with an interesting character arc about how she processes that. There are a couple of things I "liked" - I liked Rox bonding with the furry state of Oklahoma, and I wish we got to hear more on her perspective and how she sees it being better over her old "legion" life, Blish wasn't entirely terrible and did a proper heroic sacrifice thing - except he got too sidelined, so we never got a chance to get properly invested into him. But rest of the cast? Oof, SO many opportunities dropped.   
---
And yeah, ngl, I kinda hate the fact that it turns out that dragons are actually fully sentient. It made sense for Mordremoth, because, like, "Mind" dragon and all, but I actually preferred them being mostly forces of nature, which imo would've worked better for the narrative of "they're a part of the cycle". Now I'm getting a thematic whiplash, because apparently Jormag utilizes manipulation better than "mind" dragon ever did.   
---
This is why I'm saying that I wish we actually got Commander characterization rather than general worldbuilding. We're seven years in, yet all I can tell about my player character is that: Where entire armies and specialized hero squad failed, my character organized hippies into singing ominously through dredge-speakers, went to dragon's face and poked his eye out with a rapier, saying that he'd "tear him piece by piece if he has to". Nice power fantasy, not great storytelling.
---
Greg Miller's presence at most events is completely unnecessary. One of the reasons I stopped following him and Kinda Funny a couple years ago was because they started getting real corporate-y and feigning excitement for literally anything just to get a tiny bit of exposure. In all the years I followed Greg he barely even recognized PC as a viable gaming platform, let alone ever played a minute of GW2.
---
It was my way of saying, Birdo was the only great thing about that game.
---
Rest was passable, I beat it, but yeah, 3 was so much better.
---
Jesus fucking Christ that's more than 1000 days of your life. Anet should give you a medal, and some therapy lol.
---
&gt; because I want to pay for content not cash shop stuff. 
---
That's the kicker.  I'm tired of the "FarmGoldWinGame," argument (converting gold =&gt; gems).  I wanted in-game rewards; like some middle-tier exotic stuff like Volcanus, Azureflame, Infinite Light, Firebringer, Jormag's Breath (etc) -- yet we keep getting all these set items like the Astral/Stellar, Dragonsblood that have a *few* interesting looking skins but cost tens of hours of play.  
---
They don't feel worth the effort and my energy evaporates each time they put an entire set of (Quantity &gt; Quality) skins in.
---
I went afk with autoattack in Dragon Bash Arena, hopefully these bosses are more interesting, lol
---
That is probably my favorite commercial ever.
---
Well done countering.....exactly none of my points :)
---
Well done white knight, keep up the good work and i'm sure your free gems will be added to your account soon.
---
&gt; Casuals wanted easy modes for raids.
---
Yeah, no. This suggestion actually came from raiders to get more people into raiding. Sure, many casuals also thought it would be nice, but it's not like only casuals wanted this. Not at all.
---
Not op, but if you explore through the map as you go instead of rushing to each story objective you can generally extend the story "mission" for an extra 5-6 hours. Idk how they re getting 20 unless they're talking about full clearing achievements.
---
I can guarantee you that with the announcement of strike mode they won't have the capacity to introduce new raids. There is no way. 100% no.
---
yeah it was done well sadly after this they went to **only** ramble about narrative design and some tie bits here and there like 10 man boss fights, then 10 minutes showcase of crappy merchandise to close it out ...
---
Care to explain to me how I'm being toxic? No name calling here, just calling out what Im seeing
---
If we can get episodes or some type of content drop every month or 6 weeks that will alleviate some of my irritation. I fully expect to be waiting 3 months for each episode til I see otherwise though.
---
They moved the most experienced and long running ArenaNet devs *from* GW2 to work on those side projects. Then fired them. To say they didn't come from GW2 and it wasn't a loss to the game is a bit disingenuous.
---
Sure, my point is currently because of mismanaged expectations, Warframe is having the same issues GW2 had a while ago. That said, as you said, they have much better bandaid community management techniques to deal with it. A roadmap would be 100% better then nothing, I just think it's missing the underlying problem, aka monetization sources and develop resource allocation. But yeah, Warframe manages these issue better.

This may be the most disappointing moment in the story of the game for me.

People have forgotten the layoffs and expect the same amount of effort from a smaller team.
---
All I want is them to tell us things at this point, no more hiding in the dark and keeping secrets.
---
That's all good for the actual game and all, but why invest such effort and hype-building into the crappy announcement then? Silence has always been golden to ANet in the past when it came to concerns or criticism, there was no massive "game is actually literally dying this very moment!" scare they needed to counter.
---
What happened to cause this? I havent really played since they had the flying mount but you had to do a huge collection to unlock. That kinda makes me lose interest.
---
&gt; Strike missions, basically 10 people bounties, mini raids, public mode. intro to raids for noobs.
---
Hopefully more thought put into them than the bounties ...
---
The difference is WvW has actual gameplay
---
Can't you at least read what was being written before you comment? Because that is quite clearly not at all what he is saying.
---
Acceptance gang here too friend. My buddies and I have been going hard on classic WoW since it dropped. I was honestly shocked by how much more social the game feels.
---
He says you should be critical but also consider all the events that happened within arenanet and that they want to bounce back upwards
---
That's like, your opinion man.
---
Ah, yes. The Whose'it who gives a fuck. Well spotted.
---
At the time didn't they say only devs from *other* projets were slacked and the rest was assigned to Guild Wars 2, which was supposed to *help* the game?
---
Oh fuck off. You bitch about the game, don't play. Some of us love it as is and appreciate Anet. Fucking cunt.
---
If they're "not hard", then why can't these casual players just find people to them?
---
My guess is that they have a secret project that they're hoping it'll replace GW2 in one year or so (maybe GW3?), so they're giving GW2 *just* enough development to support the company until then. Pvp and WvW are effectively abandoned (they have, what, 1 dev working part-time for two years on swiss tournaments and world restructuring?). Raids are, apparently, abandoned. Guild Halls and dungeons were already abandoned in the past. They don't even seem to have a skills team responsible for designing new elite specs anymore, or if they do, they're going to take, what, 2 more years to release them?
---
GW2, in 2019, is pretty much just the living world and gemstore teams.
---
shoving a junko figure up there is probably more engaging content than anything we'll ever see in GW2 from here on out, so shove away!
---
they dont expect the same amount of effort, they demand more, and that is the problem imo
---
Travelled by train to Seattle for this and PAX.
---
It already has.
---
It's called Supply Drops. 
---
No subscription bullshit. 
---
You pay 30 bucks if you like what it comes with it, and if you don't you don't pay.
---
[Are you sure Jormag's voice is male in the trailer?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cxkyc5/something_about_jormags_voice_in_the_icebrood/)
---
&gt;Yeah, no. 
---
No, yes.
---
ok its like 2 hours realistically
---
Mike Z should clear up stuff that people are confused about. Make it clear that (if?) they will continue raid and fractal releases. Explain why alliances got delayed so much to try and convince people their current target is realistic. Say what we should expect from the release cadence for the new episodes. Tell us what the difference between seasons and sagas are.
---
This event was kind of set up to disappoint people. Everyone came in with their own thing they wanted, and a lot of people didn't even know what they wanted.
---
I like that they're teasing content ahead of time, but this isn't what the panicked portion of the fanbase needs right now.
---
You're taking this way too personally.
---
It is, get THAT through your dumbass head.
---
Why is it a problem exactly?
---
A new map doesn't fix problems with the game, it just allows people to spend a day on a new map.
---
Really? REALLY? Are you actually serious now? Have you not paid any attention to the community the last few months? The SECOND that people finished following green starbursts for War Eternal, people were complaining about the game being dead.
---
That's what reddit made of it at least, I don't think ANet themselves ever said anything to that extent
---
Mostly it's done within guilds, not on LFG
---
So as a customer,  am I supposed to just be impressed with the next line of &lt;insert car manufacturer here&gt; when there are layoffs?
---
Great,  you rallied together.  You delivered content.  That doesn't make me any less disappointed that there's no confirmation of new raids, fractals, or group content.
---
Poor management is not the customer's problem when the product that was delivered is not to their liking.
---
It's a fair point. 
---
People definitely want the world and ANet is still nursing a large wound. I think the Living World content will probably be excellent, I'd like more communication on what's down the line, but I look forward to seeing what ANet does with the story.
---
And why do they just expect us to forget that ANet decided that GW2 deserves nothing more than a skeleton crew after Path of Fire and before February 25th? If anything, we should be seeing more effort now that ANet's focus should be 100% on GW2, not 1% on GW2.
---
I love gw2 so much. And hate it so much.
---
The VP of Marketing decided that.
---
They did miss a beat though. It's true they are coming from a restructuring process and it's also true it takes time to adapt but the incredibly underwhelming content on a highly anticipated event is still a very solid fact people can argue about.
---
I'm not gonna say the game is dead but I'm pretty sure this will have a very negative impact overall
---
Uhh, you didn't. You being stupid enough to think you did doesn't mean you did.
---
Do YOU have anything to add other than sucking up Anet's balls and praising all they do?
---
You ever thought to yourself, "damn I wish she had kept her clothes on"?
---
It was still a huge restructure with plenty of gw2 developers who were laid off.. People on other projects were reassigned to gw2.. And a team can't work together within a month, team building also takes time
---
True LWS5 theory: Commander and Taimi comes up with ingenious plan - create a war between flame legion and ice legion, thus making Primordus and Jormag kill each other.
---
a nice selection of the games ugliest mtx skins
---
But that's the story. Like on day one they could have literally put in an uncompletable achievement that said "Defeat all 6 elder dragons" and you'd currently have 3/6 with little green check marks now.
---
If you mean that yelling for Mount for 5 years and Build Templates for 7 is Anet listening, then ok. 
---
How many years do you think we have to cry out our eyes before they implement a new dungeon?
---
GW2 fans: The layoffs weren't a bad thing! Now they can give us even more and better content!
---
ANet: Here's more of the same but we're calling them Strikes instead of Raids.
---
Former employee: Dude, the layoffs hit us hard what did you expect.
---
What content ?
---
We did, it just wasn't as big of a Living World announcement as it was set up to be.
---
No question. Y'all are just whiny bitches. You don't like the game? Fuck off and don't play.
---
so like a raid, but way worse. Gotcha.
---
Yeah what an exciting new feature
---
Maybe this could even be the plot twist we are headed to. The English voice is quite androgynous, so maybe they want to build up the feeling that the sexists Sons of Svanir have to worship a strong male dragon, only to drop at the end of an episode that Jormag is actually female.
---
"You only paid once for this game, so you are not allowed to complain!" is a pretty bullshit thing to say.
---
Actually they should be more productive.  Josh Foreman said (and the community knew it) that GW2 had no real direction for two years.  That's because they were basically putting the game on auto-pilot while working on the other projects.  Now that 100% of the company is on GW2, one should expect content to be coming back in full force after a few months of development time.  That would be enough time for them to settle down and get back on some kind of path.
---
The main problem with all these maps is that they are getting forgettable.  There are only a few that people even go to now and that's just because its newer or has good gold income.  You won't see anyone on maps like Ember Bay anymore.  People are over it.  Its not content you can login to every day and enjoy.
---
I think they really need to have their executives at the company sit down and find ways to monetize the game in ways that can allow them to continue to support the entire game.  If they only want to focus on this open world PvE content that people can play alone, then fine.  Just don't tell me you're gonna do something and never do it.  Don't string me along or try to hype me up.
---
Living story season was already announced as happening. There was no new announcement today. It was a complete waste of time.
---
What's mandatory in GW 2 lol? What feels like it? I mean FFXIV has a story skip and lvl skip.
---
Did we watch the same stream? The starting date for Season 5, PVP Updates, an intro to Raid mechanics styled content, did everyone just gloss over the fact they Build Saving is coming? The one thing this entire subreddit has been clamoring head over heels for years now?
---
They either dont have the resources or the ability to compete with them. They are happy to be casual play for a while every three months MMO. If anyone thinks something is gonna change they are delusional.
---
THIS IS NOT WHAT HE SAID. my god how dense are you ppl. I am disappointed by the announcement too, but for ffs I can at least put it in context.
---
First of all nobody at anet even remembers that Steve was ever a thing. We'll never get the underwater content.
---
But your comment made me think about why I'm fed up with dragons (they are cool, after all) and I realized my issue is not with the dragons. It's the dragon minions that I find boring and repetitive. We've been fighting a lot of the same enemies: people corrupted by whatever dragon is trendy this season. And with the exception of mordrem, all of these have been here since release. In HoT, various beasts living in the jungle were a breath of fresh air. Bristlebacks, arrowheads, smokescales, even the pocket raptors were completely new and I loved that. PoF introduced us to hydras and choya nad sand sharks. But now we've spent a significant time fighting people covered in crystal, and we're switching to people covered in ice. The big twist of this release is that ice-norns got some reinforcements from ice-charr. I'm not looking forward to fighting either of them.
---
Holy shit you're right!
---
was crazy.
---
I honestly hated every second he was talking because of that.
---
What?
---
He's saying that he was impressed that a company took a blow to almost a third of their workforce and rallied in a fairly impressive way. He also very clearly says it's fine to be upset if you wanted more.
---
Where are you getting hurt feelings from?
---
&gt; And besides that the latest wing is a fucking joke.
---
Qadim the Peerless and especially Adina are actually really awesome.
---
The main issue is simply that the CMs were just way too easy.
---
I really enjoyed it and look forward to some fun things. Everything expects way too much out of things. I enjoy playing and this stuff looks fun.
---
&gt; it looks more like a npc-only pirate armor set 
---
That is mostly because of the hat
---
The layoffs wouldn't have happened if Arena Net hasn't taken time, money and resources AWAY from the main game to focus on other projects in the first place.
---
Let's not forget that before trying to paint them as them just trying oh-so-hard to get back up.
---
🎉
---
For hardcore players it is a bit of a let down but for more casual/new/interested in story players this might have been a lot more exciting.. I expected more, not gonna lie but the trailer was really well made and the new strike mechanic seems neat too
---
I didn't say that. You assumed that.
---
Ive never heard anyone who wanted new dungeons when we have fractals and raids. 
---
And yes, they really didnt want them, but in the end had to relent because they knew the playerbase really wanted them. So yeah, its exactly that.
---
&gt; alliances wont happen
---
Except every tier is plagued with their own version of BG. The top server literally ruins WvW for everyone else. I think Anet is hoping the alliance update will fix those problems and why they aren't trying anything else to balance WvW.
---
&gt; it was supposed be a "we are writing them off the story for a long time" kind of thing.
---
Well, how do you know what "a long time" is? They could have died if Balthazar finished; we interrupted him and I don't recall them saying how close he was. They went back to sleep in 1330 AE and S4 ended in 1332 AE; Season 5 should pick it a bit later than that, even if not 1333 AE. So going back to sleep for 3 years could easily be enough time depending on how much power was lost; especially given the nature of magic.
---
As for Bubbles, we'll have to wait and sea. Just because it isn't the focus of the season doesn't mean nothing is happening. I mean Kralk an obvious target after Zhaitan, but Modremoth was the focus instead; even the Pact was planning for Kralk. And after HoT, we went after other dragons than Kralk, but he was still active. S3 was a bit of misdirection with focusing on Primordius and Jormag then going to the Desert for the next dragon; same could happen here.
---
Anyway, Jormag has been set up more than Bubbles. Bubbles is an unknown that hasn't been doing much that we've seen while Jormag already has the whole cracked tooth and seems to be awake again and causing problems. So of course, we'd deal with Jormag first rather than go sailing around trying to find a mystery dragon. And the less we focus on Bubbles, the more surprising the reveal can be when they finally get the spotlight.
---
do you mean lack of plans? I still don’t know what a ‘saga’ is.
---
Is Anet’s dick tasty?
---
for me gw2 is a single player game with some additional bot to use when u do group content. till they keep server online it'll be ok to me.
---
Quality reply and generally, with the new framing, I agree with all of it. 
---
ArenaNet has historically been "boom or bust" with the writing - it's either *genuinely* really good, or it's *fucking awful* and they never manage an in-between. Core Tyria story I felt was mostly pretty decent with aspects of bad writing. Trahearne was poorly written and, through no fault of his own character but through the fault of ANet's framing of him and his dialogue, became a scapegoat for a lot hatred. Heart of Thorns I *really* enjoyed, in part as a Sylvari main, and in part because ArenaNet at least tried to genuinely create some manner of character-driven conflict in the cast due to the whole "Sylvari are minions" story, but it had awful parts too. See: Trahearne, having been a scapegoat of poor writing in Core story, just being *fucking murdered* because ArenaNet thought that was what people wanted, instead of them trying to do anything that grew his character appropriately. Trahearne was too good for us. Then along came PoF and we hit the real "bust" bit of boom or bust, because just... nothing. Nothing was good. Nothing was well written. Any hint of good story in core Tyria or HoT was just abandoned for the sake of pandering to the crowd that kept demanding human focus, kept demanding the gods from GW1, etc. etc. And it was awful.
---
And now there's... there's just this. What do you even *call* this? It's not *good*. It's not even *average*. It's genuinely bad fucking writing, with characters that no longer make any sense so their development doesn't even matter because they stopped making sense *expansions* ago. On an unrelated note entirely:
---
&gt;  I liked Rox bonding with the furry state of Oklahoma
---
I nearly spit my fucking drink out all over my new keyboard, I hope you're proud of yourself. That's the funniest goddamn thing I've seen in a long time regarding this game.
---
All they had to do was release new Elite Specs. Boom, now PvE raiders have new things to experiment with, new potential PvP meta, new potential WvW meta, new experiences to be had for everyone on top of your LWS stuff. Crazy sales from everyone buying your LWS Episode 1 for the new specs. Much waw.
---
Ah, I didn't see this post. That's quite interesting, I wonder if that was done on purpose
---
&gt;  there has to be a Deus ex gimmick 
---
???????
---
To be honest, that Aurene Funko is the best looking funko they've ever come out with
---
I'll consider the fact the layoffs happened because of what the higher ups were doing.
---
I sadly cannot do it myself as the game is so CPU bound and  I'm on a laptop, but this video explains the basics of it:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MLr1nijHIo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MLr1nijHIo) 
---
The sharpening is done on the gpu itself and doesn't seem to require processing power from the processor, and in a game that is as heavily bound to a single core as GW2 that does have some good benefits. Even if you don't actually lower the resolution, the payoff with sharpening is actually quite nice at around 20% filter setting if you just look at ground and brick textures for instance.
---
You need to have some words with your mail pigeon.
---
thatsthejoke.jpg
---
You had fan boys in this subreddit running around clamoring that the layoffs were actually a positive change and would lead to better content.
---
I could see why some think Dragons are a boring enemy especially if you think about it with such simplicity. Same could be said about any potential "Final Boss" in any game with that mindset.
---
Shiro Tagachi was a normal human and had no motivation to kill Angsiyan then slash slash slash i got corrupted and am now evil slash slash slash....
---
Qadim was a nobody until recently, now he's suddenly a bad guy cuz he had a word with Zommoros. So he went and made a bunch of trials for us. big woop.
---
They're not just building a story leading up to the battle, they're building and expanding a fantasy world. We learned of the Olmakhan, met some new allies (Mist Wardens and Crystal Bloom), revisited old history in Elona. I think a lot of people call the Dragons boring because they have nothing better to say, no real critique.
---
My guess is that Anet is changed to an 8-episode format. 
---
They said there are 4 teams now, so it adds up if we assume that every team gets a big map and 2 chapters to fill in.
---
Because of all the other content and most veterand having all the skins already, it's rarer to fill a party in less than 5 minute unless the dungeon is part of the current daily achievements.
---
But if you keep an eye on daily achievements, you will always get parties on those days rather quick. 
---
For relatively 'quick' exotic gearing I'd recommend WvW, you can get exotic gear with berserker stats in the badge of honor weapon and armor vendors, and also get some extra from dungeon reward tracks.
---
Bro it's slow lol, I won't say I am at max level but at level 77? I am pretty much there. I am missing one skill. The combat is slow as shit. I love the story and music though.
---
Tbh the only thing they can say at this point it "we are done with  raids and any semblance of non-braindead pve in this game". And obviously no one will allow them to do so. 
---
I did actually expect them to at least mention raids/fractals in the future (like they did with wvw stuff, no actual release date) to keep people hanging on their own hopes (they really did need to bring everything they had to make this announcement less of a failure), but they didn't even do that. What is uncertain here?
---
&gt; **at the same level as the other MMOs** 
---
Other MMOs suck. That's why we're here in the first place.
---
This was my perspective while watching. Especially Seeing how Mike Z was talking. He was clearly nervous and also emotional.... Like has no 
---
one seen how he used to present stuff? This was a bigger deal for them than the players. 
---
But yeah.. I get people still gonna be upset. They have their rights to. 
---
For me, personally, I am happy and excited to see them landing on their feet after everything that happened.
---
AMEN. AND MAKE THAT SHIT GRINDABLE FOR DECENT REWARDS THAT ARENT LOCKED BEHIND DAILY CHESTS.
---
It's already been two years since the last expansion and the last elite specs and big features. Three or four years is a hell of a long time to go for a MMO to not receive any major releases and carry on strong. I don't think any have gone that long and lived to tell the tale.
---
Everyone (even the big "influencers") were banking on there being more substance to this than just the next LS season. Just look at Woodenpotatoes last video and his predictions of what might be coming. I'm sure some people will like just logging in for a few days every 4 months or so for the next couple of years every episode release, but a lot of players were hoping for something more.
---
ahahah
---
As am I.  I have been with the franchise since guild wars 1.  I love the game.  I really want to continue supporting it and keep it as my main game.
---
However,  I dont seem to be the demographic that anet is targeting anymore.  They're of course allowed to take the game in whatever direction they want,  but the result of switching demographics is what you see in this reddit shitstorm.
---
I was in attendance and IDK, I'm pretty excited. I travelled all the way from Austin and I'm excited that I'll be able to get some nice birthday gifts for my wife's son if her boyfriend lets me exceed my allowance (used most of it on Endgame/Captain Marvel merch).
---
I'm not excited
---
What stuff looks fun?
---
What this demonstrated to me was that Anet's overall feature outlook for the next year is going to be dismal.  WvW restructuring was first announced literally when Colin was still at Anet the first time and that was **years** ago.  If this is all we have to look forward to in the next year this game is 100% dead to me.
---
A raid every year ain't gonna keep raiders in this game, so if thats their plan, its a shitty one.
---
Good one!
---
You're not living if you aren't wearing the same 5 pairs of socks for 15 years. .____.
---
We may very well still get them, too. For me this was mostly an announcement going out to the public saying "Hey we're still here and it's going to be even easier to jump in and try us out!" Type speech. The first 10 minutes was entirely a marketing pitch to new blood, and it's needed. 
---
I don't really know where I sit on everything else since I largely play this game for it's story and if they never did anything else again I would be satisfied. But I also understand that I am in the minority of that in this sub especially. So I can see why people are disappointed. They have their rights to be and I am not shunning them for it. 
---
But Matt's perspective was definitely how I personally saw this. I was happy, not hype or let down.
---
Good armor. Its nice to have something without that overdesigned look with wings and spikes  and shit everywhere.
---
Interesting idea. I don't know if I agree though. Are there any examples of games that implement this philosophy?
---
Raid release/wvw &amp; pvp updates were fucked long before layoffs
---
They didn’t even given a timeline. They said soon not even during the icebrood saga. That is what kills me about this, their announcements where we are working on stuff with no time tables (templates, even restructuring, Swiss tournaments). All stuff we knew about before, and we got nothing new...
---
Lul, the copy paste content in every map? That dies in a couple weeks because it's "group" content? Right.
---
We expect the same from a smaller team because the people who were fired weren’t working on GW2, just side projects
---
Does anything of that give new gameplay for the gamemode? Warclaw is just messy bandage on bad existing systems (no movement Guardian trait). WvW Legendary armor is PvE content since even in 22 weeks needed for tickets you would need to do a lot of PvE to craft it (done that). And lets be real new weapon set is clearly intern work that just to bad to be BL set on the gemstore.
---
Meanwhile I have been using the same 2 build for Scourge and Firebrand since PoF release with minor alterations. Legendary WvW armor is most useless thing I've done for "upcoming WvW restructure" year+ ago.
---
&gt;Well, how do you know what "a long time" is?
---
That right there? That's called strawman. No actual argument, but since "i don't know what a long time is, that means i'm wrong!".
---
&gt; Anyway, Jormag has been set up more than Bubbles. 
---
Yes he has. He was also written off the story entirely along with Primordus, leaving only Bubbles as the only Dragon still awake, but whatever, listening to people excuse bad writing is honestly getting annoying.
---
Hmm CU is still not out yet?
---
No they got laid off for having over 1/4 to 1/3 of their entire company working on NON guild wars 2 related projects.   I'm pretty sure they have the metrics in place to figure out what type of player (pvp, wvw, pve) makes them the most money from their cash shop and what activities they do.  It doesn't surprise me at all that pve is at the top for making them money.  Most of the people complaining on the sub reddit today are like "I only Wvw or pvp I hate living story!"... does that surprise you?
---
Simply out, it doesn't matter that this was about living story. It needed to be more for us to continue to play the game. And looking around, more people were disappointed than excited. They needed to deliver expansion level stuff this season because we're two years on for pof and likely due for 18 months to two years of anothe living story season, and 4 years of only living story content = I fully quit the game instead of logging in once in a while.
---
Me who didn’t watch the live stream: this Jason guy can’t possibly be this cute..
---
Me after clicking OP’s link: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ba9_jaN7EA
---
Is he trying to guilt trip us? If you are not ready to release anything then don't hype something up with a month announcement and 2 days countdown and not expecting there will be melt down left and right when there's nothing to offer.
---
Anyone who's ever done any software development understands that it's far easier to say WHAT you intend to do, than to say WHEN it will be done.
---
Can't wait for Anetletics to so rai- oh wait they stopped making those. 
---
Well, more living world then.
---
We don't know about the underdelivering, last few episodes of season 4 had a big production value it seemed and that was a rising trend.. The announcement was disappointing doesn't mean the content will be. He is just saying to think about how to bring the criticism during this for them hard year..
---
You want some greyhaired businessman to come on stage talking about shareholders, Monthly user engagements, gemstore wins, ncsoft games etc?
---
But we're not complaining about the quality of the content, we just don't know it yet.
---
We just want content, such as Dungeon revamped, new Elite spec, new fractals, new raids, new end game content... It's so simple.
---
Oh, the event was free? I wasn't aware of that, so my point lost most of it's power.
---
Try years. It was a feature in GW1.
---
Is this guy serious? We aren't even shitting on devs per say but at the company, which is mostly represented by higher ups, which are also the people that fucked up and got that many people fired.
---
Not to mention that season 5 was announced a year ago. Expansion grade features my ass.
---
I don’t know what to say other than I expected... something, you know like I expected content lol not a 48 hour countdown to say who likes living world lol
---
Even my more realistic worst case scenario was just more of the same but with build templates and they didn’t even give that omfg
---
Well, it's the same people that make critically bashed dung of movies like the Disney remakes and Suicide Squad have sequels.
---
Right, the Bethesda presentation would make it happening again here "possible" and perhaps "plausible". But without any direct evidence here, I wouldn't say your hypothesis has reached "probable".
---
&gt; Was it overhyped or is the GW2 community desperate for more than more of the same?
---
whynotboth.gif
---
It kind of ended up as a perfect storm of expectations on both sides.
---
During the intro I could swear I heard the host say "for the next hour" and then it was all over in half hour.
---
Only shows how mamy issues there are with the engine. They're working with what is basically legacy code. Been there, done that. Not fun. Really hope once they plan GW3 they switch engine to something modern, like UE4 or Unity, rather than in house engine
---
It sounds like you want more layoffs to happen.
---
I'm part of the player base and I'm excited for more maps and story, and the strike missions sound fun.
---
Of course they don't owe anybody anything. Pointing this out is really just missing the point at best and on the other side of things could be a strawman.
---
Arenanet is a company trying to sell a product to Consumers. The players on this sub are consumers trying to evaluate whether or not they want to patronize the company. Saying that they're disappointed in the product it has been revealed does it mean if these people think they're owed anything: it means that they're feeling as consumers is that they're disinterested in the product.
---
Yep. I don't expect them to say everything 100% clearly in a live presentation. That's why it's important for the game director to read everyone's feedback and make a clarification post to address what people are saying.
---
who*
---
Mike Z and Mike O are 100% of the reason why WvW is in the state it is in.  They are by far and large the least effect game directors I've ever seen in any game.  ArenaNet should get rid of Mike Z and get someone with **actual balls and vision** to provide the direction of the game.
---
Its broken in 1v1 but for team play it sucks as it gives up much of its mobility for the condi pressure.
---
hey, at least I will gain some entertainment value from watching this game crash and burn. That's something to be excited for
---
The LS4  story was hot trash. Of course that is my opinion but please, tell me why I am wrong.
---
Go ahead!

FFXIV doesn't revolutionize on any system. Sure you can level all the classes on one character, but you still have to level them and you pretty much spam duties until your brain falls out. Not to mention how long and boring the MSQ is.  Anything FFXIV has done (besides be Japanese), WoW has done, if not better.
---
I'm sorry, but if they don't retool their reward systems it's all pointless labor. 
---
People aren't going to commit to pared down content if all it gives is the same rewards you get elsewhere.
---
"Guaranteed rare and raw materials" is not a reward anymore. These things need to a unique reward system. They need to stop looking at rewards as simply cosmetic or monetary items. We need something we can work for.
---
It may also be Drakkar in the whispering since we know that they are going to be in it
---
You're misundersranding or misconstruing.
---
We could kill Kralkatorrik because we had a ready replacement. Aurene.
---
And this was established in PoF, but hinted at in S2, just like "killing Elder Dragons is bad" was hinted at back in S2, both very much so in Hidden Arcana.
---
Things did change. We had a ready replacement in S4. We didn't in S3 or PoF (due to Vlast's death) and we no longer have one anymore. We had 4 Elder Dragons, and despite Kralkatorrik's death we have 4 Elder Dragons.
---
Hello? NCsoft? 
---
And no one asked them to give us expansion right now. Just more stuff from this announcement.
---
In their defence, Elegy/Requiem medium does not look like a trenchcoat.
---
tbh it was more like damage control and keeping their heads above the water. by no means anyone believes that laying off more than one third of the company had no impact on the game.
---
This is truly hype vs reality.
---
THey haven't said much about expansion worthy features since the layoffs though. And most of what they have pushed (Leggy Runes, 500 cooking, etc) have actually been what would otherwise come with a GW2 Expansion.
---
Why do I get labeled as an empathyless asshole if I am disappointed the game stopped catering to what I wanted from it?
---
I can only tell them what I want and don't want. It's their literal job to figure out if they want to do that and if so, how it is possible.
---
This is just such a rude tweet.
---
It's so nice to see that people write positively about the announcement. Well spotted!
---
Don't be let down by those that are disappointed because the main part of the announcement didn't touch that part of the game they like most.
---
Of course it exists. Was this ever a doubt?
---
So that's a maybe for Cantha?
---
Of course they don't, and we don't owe them. People were just hoping for a reason to get back into the game they loved and they didn't get that. End of story.
---
We also don't owe ANet anything... What's your point than?
---
This. My issue - and I think the issue for many - is not what was shown, but the manner in which Anet chose to show it. I genuinely feel bad for them because the response has been so negative, but I can't help but question their decision making. 
---
Maybe, coming off the back of the lay offs earlier this year and all the disruption that would have brought, they felt they had to go big, make a real statement, but sad to say I think it was the wrong play. 
---
What they did announce has been overshadowed by everything they didn't mention, in large part because they themselves created the illusion of a much bigger announcement than it actually was.
---
It's an mmo, the age is irrelevant.
---
Pretty sure they have a better idea of what people are spending money on than you
---
Preach preach
---
You want someone to lose their job over 30 minutes because they wanted to try something new.
---
 ^(I was gonna add questionmark to that but thats basically what you want so)
---
Low effort drama bait, goodbye 👋
---
&gt; "burned out" (which isnt the right word, since its not from overworking  but from repeating the same thing over and over and over again in small  daily doses) 
---
[bored out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boreout) ;)
---
**Boreout**
---
Boredom burnout syndrome is a psychological disorder that causes physical illness.
---
This theory was first expounded in 2007 in Diagnose Boreout, a book by Peter Werder and Philippe Rothlin, two Swiss business consultants.

---
Technically there is in AB or even in Guild Hall?  Even sPVP custom games as well. 
---
Dueling is not even a top 10 issue IMO when it comes to competitive gameplay.
---
They teased so much about the new content coming out. I'm not sure what exactly people were expecting other than them to magically have a full expansion in their pocket.
---
This was much better than the crappy teases they had for living story episodes in the past. People always used to complain so much about those, but I guess it's easy to forget.
---
It's the way you bring the criticism not about the content what you say
---
Imagine thinking the terrifying and generic funko pops look cute. Can't relate.
---
I respect what they can pull off, I am not being toxic, but really: what do you expect?
---
I still have nothing to play in the game except 3 hours of story every 3 months. A little more if I care about some festival/episode achievements.
---
I can't play the game because this same content drought has been worsening sine the end of LS1, and I do have the right to be disappointed in the game not getting better with so much potential.
---
I wouldn't be disappointed if I didn't care about the game, so I'm sorry about what you've been through recently, but don't tell me it's just now that this happened.
---
I can’t help but wonder what he’s up to. He has to be awake by now with all the magical surges that have happened the past few years. What are you plotting, Steve..?
---
If this guys quit GW2, they will come back when the Cantha expansion be released... lol
---
Melee 3.0 is out in certain aspects and not in some,since it is a massive overhaul. Railjack is dropping in 2019 Fall,and the month was also specified,yet my memory sucks atm. Also,the Cinematic frame quests being canned comes very probably from the fact literally everyone was annoyed by them. Thematically cool sure,but no one liked Titania s flower collecting boogaloo.
---
Also,at least Warframe HAS a roadmap. GW2 is a guessing game.
---
What's scary is that he's the most handsome Charr seen...which obviously means he's the biggest jerk of them all. Never trust a pretty face!
---
&gt; Autoattacking
---
You can argue against casuals without strawmanning them.
---
And Anet should have considered the impact of such a lackluster presentation.
---
No, the trailer blows chunks lmao it shows off nothing and doesn't get me excited for anything except for maybe all the hard drive space I'll free up when I uninstall
---
Aurene in particular looks very well-sculpted. A quick repaint of her eyes and she’d be a very cute figure I think, Pop or not.
---
LOL the first carrot is just an announcement and then it has a smaller carrot that is alliances. love it!
---
Ooh yes, exactly that!
---
It is a hard time for the studio indeed, but how do they expect the players who care about more things in game than just LW feel when their gamemodes have been ignored for so long? Should we applause the wrong direction they are taking the game that is causing so many people to feel disappointed? It's not the players' fault, it's Anet's.
---
Either you are legitimately stupid and you missed the point or this is a big, long, boring strawman.
---
its' amazing what people expect the devs to be able to pump out. sheesh
---
Part of marketing is delivering.
---
&gt; They purposely overhyped this announcement
---
They really didn't. The hype was mostly self-generated by players, on reddit and elsewhere.
---
The wallpaper was the whole joke of this shit post.
---
I love the shirt thank you for the content Arenanet much love from Paraguay
---
Yes the devs are great and all. Our disappointment isn't directed at them but at Anet, a multi-million dollar company. And I have a really hard time to feel pity for a company.
---
I'm tired of the layoffs excuse.  
---
How long is it going to be broad up everytime Arenanet disappoints ? It's been half a year already, and while this isn't much time on the scale of videogames developpement, it's enough time for me to not care anymore, sorry. 
---
You guys fucked around and didn't get anything done, your boss came and did what he had to do. Too bad, happens to everyone.
---
That's actually a great way of putting it
---
i doubt that,fanboys gona cheer to literaly anything,when you look at fallout 76,borderlands 3 presentations fans cheerring to every shit they see,it can be even "*hello,NAME OF THE GAME,bye*.
---
Content needs money to fund it
---
......yes, of course they mentioned it's still there, what is your point?
---
We already had Aurene back when we kept saying we couldn't kill Kralk though. Sure, Balthazar kidnapped her at one point, but that was after we firmly established that our goal was saving Kralk.
---
Other than the story, nothing else.
---
Yeah, I think he didn't know what he was getting into. He seemed genuinely passioned about his presence there .. for naught. I almost feel sorry for him.
---
I guess his presence made the stream have more views cause of his influence? I guess? Does that even matter?
---
Honestly, I was actually thinking they were going to announce an Expansion and then tease GW3 coming in like 2021 or something. What was given was not enough to rent out space and have a live audience for.
---
Everything about Kourna indicated that teams weren't talking to each other and there was no oversight. So many pet projects with no integration (turrets, beetle), literally incomplete map, etc. Maybe the stealth mission was just the one guy who did his job.
---
He was the best part
---
The problem with that logic is that even if the "casuals" drive the game's finances, the veterans drive the casuals. If the veterans leave, suddenly there's no one to lead, and the casuals will follow suit.
---
Me too....
---
500 codes at the live event, only 5 on stream, lul
---
It might go away, because there are more and more red flags signaling "maintenance mode", or even cancelation.
---
That's what we fear. That's why we hoped to get something. They hyped us up for nothing.
---
This whole thing was half-assed. Thrown together in a few weeks trying to calm the masses. Apart from cinematics, we were not shown anything. 
---
Based on this presentation, we don't even know if the game has any future after episode 2
---
They're not for you. They're for the whales. GW2 runs on whale semen.
---
You're right, they don't owe us anything. So I can just uninstall the game since i've got nothing to expect from it.  
---
This kind of mindset would literally kill the game. Of course they owe something to the playerbase. They have to give content. Stuff to do. Or players will just simply stop playing the game.
---
And a competent team.
---
what a joke lol
---
Surprise, surprise. The former devs are just as out of touch as the current devs!
---
Let's fix our joke game by making it similar to this even more joke game.
---
ya the up coming months turned into 2 years already ppl already lost hope
---
Yep, this was a worse case scenario. At least I can commit to wow classic now
---
I gladly took it, as i didnt have the first in the box.
---
...but I have all of those already
---
Spam this net to kill a net
---
No wonder how you see it, announcing and delaying for a few months is never as worse as never anouncing anything and letting everyone in uncertainty.
---
The only way to get more backslash is to purely delete what you're working on. And if you do that for years of development, you have other issues than PR.
---
ppl who dont play gw2 aint gonna care about GW2 after that show
---
I'd still love to see a Flame Legion splinter group in the LS that feels that women need to be protected. It'd make for some cute/funny moments, where one or more of them ends up being really overprotective of Rox.
---
I never said that made you wrong; just that you claimed "it was supposed be a "we are writing them off the story for a long time" kind of thing." We don't know that; that is just an assumption on your part. Perhaps the story will give a lame reason for why Jormag is back on the scene or perhaps it will make sense. Those parts of the story were left vague; it wrote them off for S3, but it never gave a timeframe of how long they'd be inactive and it in no way wrote them out of the story entirely. So just because you think it should be a long time, that doesn't mean it is a plot hole in the writing that Jormag awakes in S5 like you are claiming.
---
Only* part
---
Primordus-Jormag 1v1 presented by Taimi is the most obvious solution into dealing with them fast.
---
about what exactly?
---
Eh, FFXIV has a shitload of content, honestly. I don't do most of it, but it's there if I want it. Shadowbringers was an amazing expansion, story-wise, and the new fights just keep getting better and better. GW2 needed to bring something big here and they just didn't, though I will agree that the game already has an insane amount of content.
---
So why have a subreddit to talk about the game at all?
---
&gt; You like something about the game and want to talk about it?
---
&gt;"LUL. Get a life."
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt;You don't like something about the game and want to talk about it?
---
So, why are you here? Need to get a life much?
---
He is basically just the real life version of Lord Krall
---
He's probably decent human being, but why should I care about the lay offs? I'm a customer, their company wants to sell me more stuff. Should I make purchases based on sympathy? Or to make them feel better?
---
Me Reading Reddit r/Guilwars2 : 
---
"Here We Go Again... "
---
GW2 is still a boring dumpster fire.
---
Back to classic wow
---
No matter what the previous history for Anet is, they could have prepared this announcement better. They shouldn’t have dressed it up the same way that they do for their expansion announcements, if they were just going to continue to leave us in the dark. 
---
I think they should have been honest at the beginning of August, made it a long feature video where Mike Z and the team explain their plans for restructuring. But instead they rented a theatre and then created a lot of hype surrounding this.... only to give us vague teasers, a very unclear content schedule, and pop figures.
---
Did I understand it the right way
---
The prologe to the Saga is free
---
Does that mean we have to pay for the rest .. like .. for an expansion
---
(I mean, I am totally fine paying for it, if it has the content worth for it if we have to, but after the last LS ...)
---
I KNOW   
---
And that Trailer ? *Way too Blue, I am Positively Outraged at this! Unplayable. How dare they use* ***That*** *Shade of blue!!!(one)1!*  ..   
---
# /s
---
Originally they were going to, but I think they pushed the release or announced it far too soon. There's even a few paths in Dragon Stand unused, a few characters that only appear there like the Countess, and a few scenes from the trailer that were unused.
---
Ok sorry that i'm sorry that you're easily hurt?
---
I rather pay subscription fee than get sub par content after 3 months
---
Are we calling random reddit posts articles now?
---
I mean, what they said was fine and what they are offering is fine, imo.
---
It's the build up. They give us an email inviting us to a special event a month in advance. Last time I got an email inviting me to a special announcement event it was for the Path of Fire announcement. Naturally, I expected something of the same delivery.
---
I knew they said they were not doing an expansion and going straight to S5, which is fine. But I thought that this LS announcement would show us the 'expansion like' stuff that they said would be included with LS updates going forward. Things like elite specs, for example.
---
This gave us no more information than just a simple trailer + blog post for an average patch drop.
---
The event, coupled with previous events and interviews, raised the expectation bar higher.
---
All of this crying just proves how obnoxious this subreddit gets when people don't get their way.
---
Positively negative
---
Like Star Citizen? Wasn't it a game that was first announced like 10 years ago? And it isnt the game stucked in perma "early access of early access"? If its THAT game then no, thanks, i dont want another "pay us now and maybe childrens of your childrens will get playable game".
---
From me - NO.
---
ooh yeaa...joyyyy a feature that should have been in the game for 7 years, gosh darn it I'm so happy! pvp updates that they announced 5 months ago, "an intro to raid mechanics but nothing new for raiding" OH NICE. Yea that's some quality content ya got there /s.
---
To all you apologists.
---
Stop acting like a cult, people are allowed to criticise the game.
---
OSRS
---
I am pretty sure another kind of fantasy was meant here.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm also excited for everything that WAS announced. The problem was they announced a few cool things, but didn't include the necessary explanations that needed to accompany the new structure, so all we can do is guess at the rest. To your last question, that's precisely the point now - we knew what to expect with Living Story Seasons, and we had a cadence we could expect it in. Now, we have heard the start of what a Saga is, but have no idea what the details are or how it follows through. That's the real blunder here.  
---
My hope is they can come back with a "Sorry, here's more information on what The Icebrood Saga is and what is coming down the line" and try to rally out of this downed state. Then I'll be right back on the hype train.
---
You're dumb.
---
This was honestly as bad as Blizz hyping up Diablo fans only to give them a Chinese-cloned phone game.
---
In the real world, there is no reward for trying. At the end of the day you are fighting against the competition in a very competitive environment, and how rough you have had it dosen't really matter to the average consumer...
---
You are fighting for the attention of the consumer in a world were it's not just a handful of mmo's but every game want's to be a live serivce that keeps people engaged, and no one has enough free time to keep up with it all.
---
If your product is mediocre at best, then people are gonna go elsewhere, no matter what internal studio issues there may be.
---
Those are gonna look awesome. As you're sitting in queue, waiting desperately for the other 9 people who still play sPvP to log in so you can find a match, you'll have plenty of time to show off your new PvP armour set to the excited onlooker.
---
"If you purchased and activated Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns before 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time (UTC-7) on August 30, 2019, we’ll send you a Heart of Thorns Veteran’s Package"  Looks like it is too late.
---
I would give the official retailers the weekend to adjust their offerings before purchasing.
---
I'm not gonna speak for all those who like this or might like it. I don't care. You guys do you and keep having fun.
---
They wanna rake in new players and new money, and people returning for a couple of weeks with their money. They want open world. But they don't want players like me who are active, stream, take part in discussions and, worst of all, have expectations.
---
It's okay though. I didn't expect a big announcement, I expected a message of some sort whether or not they'll make a game that is for me. And they delivered on that part.
---
This. I'm so tired of devs blaming circumstance/fans/reviews as if we're expected to keep buying/playing their games no matter what.
---
There is alot of competition out there, it wont matter if you tried and failed, a good product sells itself.
---
It always comes down to the bottom line. I was hoping to see something that would make me go "Yep, buying 4K gems right now because I'm happy with that I saw from the announcement". Which is what I've done in the past - people often use "vote with your wallet" when it comes to negative things, but I apply it for positive things as well.
---
Didn't buy gems today.
---
I mean that's certainly an opinion.
---
I played GW1 since the E3 beta and I played it up until the GW2 beta.
---
And I have played GW2 ever since and I like GW2 more than GW1.
---
Another apologist, yawn.
---
Agree with everything. but specially:
---
&gt; Why did they waste developer resources on the Kralkatorrik Flying instance if they are in such an impoverished state? It's a genuine question. I realize that instance was probably well into development even before the layoffs happened, and maybe Episode 6 was just the remnants they had left. But it still highlights the problem with development.
---
Ding ding ding.
---
ArenaNet never had a resource problem. I mean, look at LW1 and the cadence and amount of content. The problem with ArenaNet is on the way they spend those resources, wasting them constantly on either pretty visuals, experiments, or temporary bullshit.
---
They need to get their priorities right, and stop neglecting the game.
---
This is the best argument I've seen. Thank you - thinking of the announcement as a way to grab new players makes a bit more sense
---
I could, if you stop acting like an asshole.
---
Getting personal because of a comment, seriously, your kind of comment is so much overdriven. It's not just "bad" or "misplaced", it's absolutely the worst. Those personal insults can turn into cyber mobbing very easily. And this can turn into self harm or even suicide way faster than you think.
---
Playing "fanboy and hater" is one thing, but if you need to bully people in a personal way because of this, you should quit online forums and get psychological help. Not because of you, but because of those people you will hurt.
---
Yeah, trailer and story are looking dope as fuck. 
---
They certainly have that going for them. I'm also excited that the maps are gonna be moer dynamic, like in LS2. They will expand over the story which hopefully will give them more leeway to have a lengthier and meatier story. 
---
Tho if this announcement taught me anything, is that I should take off the hype wheels ..
---
From my perspective, it would not have been hard for them to make the announcement less of a failure. Its what it is, and to be frank, his statements are ridiculous.
---
Then maybe they shouldn't have spent the money to rent a theater at PAX.
---
Agreed
---
Dont forget that WvW hasn't been updated for several years now, PvP swiss was in developement over 1.5 years and raid release schedule is a joke since wing3 -&gt; wing4
---
I mean its clear they wanted to do mobile. Their masters told them now. They could just tank the game until their masters say it makes sense to just do mobile.
---
Watered down expansion-like features... Instead of elite specs we just get a new traitline (but maybe it will involve new skills/weapon too? Might have missed some details). New raids/end-game content... Training mode as a bulletpoint release instead of a supplement to real end-game content.
---
TL;DR
---
ANet overhyped. Community massively overhyped. ANet gave an announcement full of good features people wanted, story direction a lot of folks wanted (but not Cantha), but not great and awesome features as community overhyped themselves for. Then ended with cringy merchandise that feels horribly out of place.
---
Overall felt like a series of live blog posts and not a PAX level announcement.
---
And everyone who claims to have expected little are bullshitting liars.
---
So you're mad that they're actually trying to advertise now ?   
---
I'm sorry, Did you want the game to actually die so you can feel justified in your anger?
---
I'd say it could go either way. Jormag might be the weakest Elder Dragon we've fought so far since it would have only recently awakened and unlike Modremoth, it wouldn't have had a bunch of leyline energy. It would also be a bit awkward to add a bunch of Shiverpeak maps in S5 but then have an expansion where you fight Jormag and be unable to use those maps if they required PoF. But they could do a Fire and Ice expansion after building Jormag up for a season.
---
If I had to take a guess, S5 will build up Jormag, maybe kill, and then we'll switch focus to Bubbles for the next season/expansion. But S4 showed up they have no issue with killing a dragon outside of expansions and with no mention of new expansion and a focus on Living World, I don't see why they would avoid killing Jormag in S5 if we build up to it enough. Unlike S2 and S3 which were both picking up where we left off and building towards the new antagonists, S5 much like S4 does state pretty clearly right off the bat that Jormag is our focus.
---
You baboons keep buying their crap and playing their game. Vote with you wallet and /played
---
They don't give a shit about your opinion if you keep taking their bait.
---
Now this is interesting they used key V to dodge the question. I am quite disappointed and mad
---
Yeah.  Though I bought it from Amazon and not ArenaNet.  I imagine they are mailing in batches though, I usually get stuff pretty late in the cycle.
---
Sorry - Not full pve but a big part of it. New maps, enemies, question, function for PVE. Sorry that raid was not include so I correct my statement on that but still a big part of it. Wvw/pvp was forgotten and cast aside. Same promises from years before but actually no set in date but "soon".
---
We really don't have enough information to guess one way or the other.
---
But a company is a compilation of people and is limited by what its people can do. The company does not turn on its own. The people in the cubes doing the work are trying to figure out what to do and how to do it. 
---
You're paying a company, but it's a team of individuals that make the thing you are buying, and it's that team that got thrown around 6 months ago.
---
&gt; the open world and story is the most important part of the game
---
of a SINGLEPLAYER GAME. This is a MMO, give us MMO content
---
props for them for that but i'm putting money to the product based on how enjoyable I find it. And what the promise is, it aint all that appealing
---
You are sure? Out now they only said at the show that the prolouge is free and said this twice instead of: " we give you whole saga aka living world for free".
---
Im still afraid that saga episodes now costs gem to milk the part of comunity which is still here
---
But i really hope im wrong
---
It may have been public speaking nerves. Hard to tell.
---
This just emphasizes how BAD is the communication between us and anet. It's actually pathetic to be honest.
---
he clearly thinks our reaction is to what was said lol
---
Anyone know where I can buy that mousepad??
---
to be fair, certain maps int hot were annoying as shit to navigate...
---
I refer to the WiiU for an example what not to name your product and how it thwarts expectations.
---
I said the same thing, congratulations on being more civil about it, I'm more or less on the same page except I was expecting this.
---
&gt; Plus less currencies to grind. Probably more needed on each map, but not so many of them.
---
The downside of this is these players who farmed currency in first episode won't bother with newly released parts of map (more than once) since they already have currency.
---
I prefer if there was one global currency for all LS5 maps (like it was with Unbound/Volatile Magic), general currency which is used only this map (so like Airship parts/Ley Line Crystals/Geoides/Bandit Crest/etc) and additional one (smaller amounts) like Chak Eggs/Exquisite Serpentite Jewels/Reclaimed Metal Plates which will be tied to specific, released part of map.
---
I just log in to unlock the new zone. The quest line added doesn't mean anything to me.
---
You're right.
---
We also don't owe Anet anything.
---
What's your point?
---
Also, something I really hate about these tweets: In one way or another, they seem to imply the developers are in charge, and thus responsible.
---
Absolutely not. The only ones to blame here are the managers and project leaders who tell the developers what to do. The ArenaNet problem is called management, so either call them out, or shut up, but don't defend your coworkers when they did nothing wrong and are not responsible for the stupid directions they were told to follow.
---
They owe you nothing. You pay no subscription to play.
---
And all the whiteknights will defend them
---
Literally the hottest MMO right now is WoW Classic. A game frozen in time from 15 years ago.
---
Anet did so many things right with GW2, but they got so many things wrong at the same time.
---
I'm a little more disappointed than you are, but I largely agree with you. I was hoping for a little more info, but I'm not going to pitchfork over it. I'm certainly sympathetic towards people who were looking for more info; I just don't see myself joining in on the outrage.
---
I think that a lot of people can end up having a hard(er) time making the difference between the people on lower levels of the development chain and the people who can actually influence and/or impose a course for a game. And by conflating both it usually ends with a weird mixed bag of anger directed at everybody at the same time while the top of the chain is probably the area that could be the most responsible for what happened. And for this I am not only talking about a chian stopping at Mike Z because maybe he's doing whatever he can with the ressources he's being allocated and the more or less specific frame he can move inside (also maybe not but from here we kinda cannot know what the exact situation is).
---
It’s not a matter of overhype. This was tempered as much as it could have been. It’s the fact Anet just underdelivered. They fail to provide the basic needs of a Game’s as a Service play model and so people are upset they have sunk so much time and effort into a product that is clearly being mismanaged.
---
I got LW2 and 3 a day before they went on sale in the gem store. I asked if I could get the difference refunded in gems, and they did it for me.
---
It was really nice of them :)
---
Things being delayed and canned is a natural part of game development though. Every game has a ton of features, modes, changes, just to name a few examples thats constantly getting canned or delayed. The problem with the approach of showing things to the community is that a lot of people see showcasing something as a promise that its going to be hitting the game very soon. Its much better to delay something and fixing it until its ready then to release an unpolished turd just to satisfy some loud people that want/need it NOW.
---
But what happens when/if a new expansion drops? People will start complaining immediately that there wasn’t enough, and they’ll get bored and leave. Constantly looking ahead rather than enjoying the moment means you can never be satisfied. Empyrean drops for Warframe, or Blight drops for Path of Exile, and even if (in the case of Warframe) they’re massive game changers, the same people will quickly and inevitably complain and get bored and disillusioned.
---
I literally feel the worst for the live audience, what an absolute waste of time.
---
The only complaints that WvW did is the Alpine map change to "Desert map", adding gliding, mounts into the WvW which no one from top Tier servers ever asked for. Yea might be some "low tier wvw matches been asking for that, but that's lower players than the Top Tier WvW servers".
---
No one appreciated when ArenaNet asked the community, the entire community to vote for a Desert map, you could correct me here or there.
---
If they scale down WvW to Alliances battle from GW1 can be a good solution to be frankly honest. The rubber band is quite often when Zerg vs Zerg vs Zerg in one spot.. like 50+vs50+vs50+.
---
I just hope things gets actually better in future.
---
It’s embarrassing.
---
like the longer it goes since the announcement, the more irritated i get
---
They left it ambiguous though. He said "The prologue will be free if you own Path of Fire". If they gave paid episodes after that, that sentence would not be a lie.
---
We've been waiting 2 years already for Swiss, we'll get it in a couple months though :)
---
&gt; Expansion-level features?
---
Honestly, I'm not even sure where this quote comes from 
---
It comes from Mike Z himself. 
---
&gt; Shacknews: What can players expect from the Living World in the near future?
---
&gt; Mike Z: We are starting to ratchet things up, bigger threats, bigger villains, if you can imagine that on top of what we've done just recently. The promise that we're making players right now is that this season, we are planning to release a new mount that players weren't expecting. And the thing we're saying right now is, Living World is working. It's an amazing strategy that allows players to come in every two to three months, get a really cool piece of content, get a new map, play the expansion with their friends. **But now we're raising the stakes and we're actually starting to release what we'd consider expansion-level features**, alongside these things, when they come online, when they're ready.
---
https://www.shacknews.com/article/107195/guild-wars-2-sixth-birthday-interview-mike-zadorojny-talks-the-living-world
---
&gt; Because they are taking feedback from twitter and facebook which is full of brainless whales that are filling their pockets.
---
&gt; It's us who are not getting that Anet doesnt care about veterans,
---
So, in one sentences you've put most of twitter/facebook followers into some not-so-nice category and in the next sentence you deny someone actually interested in the story 'veteranhood'. What does this say about you?
---
We're going to make Aurene fat if we keep killing dragons
---
if you wanna play this game as a RPG YES, if you wanna play the game as a MMORPG then NO
---
stunning and brave
---
At the same time, we don’t know what else is planned for the future. I agree that today’s presentation didn’t give us a whole lot of information to look forward to, but it also doesn’t mean that we won’t get a bunch of further info before the end of the year. Who knows, we might get a fuller picture of ANet’s plans in the coming months that DOES give people hope. I agree that he way this was presented was pretty much a disaster, but I don’t think this necessarily means that all is lost. 
---
Also, I get what you’re saying, and yes, the community is going to have a visceral reaction, but I’m advocating appreciation and gratitude over demands and anger. Why not enjoy what we have and accept what we’re given?
---
Yep I recently sold everything I had in my collection tabs cause I wasn't using it, will give the gold to my guildies
---
Not sure why they didn't give that or the knife tail bond. That is a lot more foolproof. Even if someone has everything unlocked now they can still use it in the future unlike this one.
---
How do you feel about a company making an announcement of an trailer about more of the same without any concrete date and announcing more announcements also soon™ from stuff we’ve been waiting for years already?
---
Yeah... it was pretty bad.
---
ModBot couldn't handle the truth. ^^
---
glad for you. im gonna play the new PoE league and BL2
---
Can you count? I listed three issues, playing exclusively with other casuals addresses one.  And my list is far from exhaustive.
---
Looks more like bargaining which flows over to depression ("please get your shit together Anet" remark).
---
Ok, playing 3000 hours doesn't make anybody special. It was 3000 hours of being entertained but the person put it into the comment like it helped their argument or like it was some kind of wasted investment, instead of 3000 hours of being entertained for a rather cheap prize for that much time. The person can still complain but adding on that they got that much time out of it already makes them just sound like an ungrateful child instead of lending weight tho their complaint.
---
Feelings don't pay the rent. That's a hard lesson there many still have to learn.
---
I'm so at odds with this. I love good worldbuilding, and in fact I place it above all else in stories I enjoy, but... I can't help but agree with a lot of what you've said. Good worldbuilding doesn't mean much if the things supporting it are meaningless.
---
I'm a casual (used to do T4s, now do open world only more or less), and easymode raids sound fun for me to do now and then.
---
But I know that without hardcore players we won't see sites like metabattle stay updated and the knowledge base of the community will diminish.
---
And honestly, even as a casual I'm disappointed. It'll be more of the same and the last few living story releases have had gold sinks, cool story, and very little else. No replayability. I'm more like to run dragons stand or octovine then go to any of the LS4 maps.
---
No they have no clue, Final Fantasy 11, Rift, and Secret World are in maintenance mode.
---
It's rather overly dramatic.
---
I am
---
They did mention mini pvp seasons, I'm hoping it will be 2v2.
---
I think that is actually a lot better to partially uncover a map over several episodes than to push a completely new map for each episode, and not just from the point of the amount of work.
---
Swiss tournaments that might be too late at this point, a currently mythical WvW revamp that we've seen nothing about, and a ugly PVP set.
---
Yay?
---
The only thing I was hoping for was the announcement of new specs. And they did not deliver. Everything else is about as much as I expected. Nothing special, nothing to be excited about for me personally. I guess the next 2 years will be playing in a 3 month interval and waiting for the next release.
---
People can have different opinions about Warclaw. I play a lot of WvW and like it. You didn't really give me any reasons why it's bad. The only one I've really hard is that it makes ganking harder, which I kind of think as a positive instead of a negative.
---
The poster above asked for new rewards which is why I brought up the new stuff. I understand that rewards don't motivate everyone and the game mode needs to be intrinsically fun to succeed. As for balance, I understand WvW has been pretty stagnant. PvP on the other hand has had great balance recently, with ANet being attentive to problem builds and applying buffs to create new builds. Anyone who still thinks PvP balance is bad either has not been paying attention to the game mode, or will never find any balance state in PvP satisfactory (other than maybe their own builds OP with nobody really complaining about them lul).
---
Balance is tricky, and the scale of play in WvW makes it even more so. They could throw a 10 person team of people highly engaged in WvW to do sweeping balance changes and it would probably just result in people getting upset.
---
to be fair game isn't dead. but the relationship of many people of community and the game isn't healthy. probably means that the game isn't for us anymore.
---
Shield looks likes it’s tier 1 cultural weapon for norn.
---
Stop lying to yourself dude.
---
Speak for yourself. 
---
I've been playing since headstart,  and i have zero interest in raids.  New season with new maps and stuff is cool with me.  I'd have liked some word about new elite specs, or at least some major class updates. But otherwise i have no issue with what they're doing.
---
Exactly what happened for me. Played GW1 a lot, GW2 til fractals. I’m into Kinda Funny so I watched the stream because Greg was hosting and figured “maybe I’ll get back into it.” The stream seemed underwhelming and confusing so I came here and found a lot of confirmation that I should probably continue to stay away :(
---
Can't say anything until I see them in action.
---
A curious choice of words given that Bangarang is selling *womens'* apparel...
---
Agreed lad
---
Well i hope it does, because ANet doesn't deserve to keep this game afloat. Also as it is no longer fun for me, i suffer no damage and reading through negativity of something that you at this point hate is quite fun actually.
---
So i'm going to keep doing this and enjoy doing it.
---
SFR &amp; Vizu.. That brings back memories! Never thought those two would be matched together haha.
---
The only thing these tweets seem to show is how full of themselves game devs are.
---
Your comment proves literally nothing save that you are not a casual player, because to any player limited to a casual amount of play time, ascended gear is a grind.
---
Go play ff14 ur missing out on better raiding, or try wow classic.
---
&gt; I think the only mistake was the amount of hype they tried to generate for it. 
---
I think the mistake was not working on expansion 3 immediately after PoF launched. They should have done what they did with HoT - put out S4 while working on EXP3. If they had done that, by the time of the layoffs EXP3 would have been well underway and they wouldn't be scrambling trying to put out some new content now.
---
I’ve been playing since GW1 Prophecies. Today’s event was the first time in 10+ years of playing this game that I felt legit disappointment in an announcement for a new season or new content.
---
They just really seem to not care anymore.
---
Silence only makes things worse. How many times have they made this mistake already?
---
I want actual villains, I want villains with character, with motives, with reasons for doing what they are doing, not be want to get big and eat u
---
They honestly just sound like trial fights from FFXIV, which I'm all for. GW2 needs content like that.
---
Therre was absolutely no reason for Anet to waste the time or money for the stage.  This has done more harm for the game than good given it was just a glorified blogpost.  Which is exactly what people will expect if they ever do a live event again.  Nothing really to look forward to outside of the status quo.
---
Mexican Batman?
---
What I do not understand at all is that 3 years ago, they were presenting S3E2 (episode + pvp Djinn map) in a very casual way, it was positive. 2 years ago, they were preparing POF and we were getting regular infos and they had a nice meet and greet at PAX. Last year they made a video to present Sun's refuge and next episode, everybody liked it. They even on that occasion said that we were getting a season 5 with "expansion worthy features". 
---
This year they do not have more than usual: an episode that is not called episode (but no one really explains why because of short time), plans for the next months in shape of Ep1 and 2 (roughly 6 months plan), projects that are announced literally for years that still do not get more precise release time frame (template, Swiss and alliances) and then nothing about Fractals or Raid (oh yes easy mode open world raid which may induce delays in regular ones) or an "expac worthy feature" which most people translated as Espec (the only things we got only at Expac release). 
---
On the other end I really liked how the devs were talking, especially the narrative team which really felt involved and passionate for the story. I know they needed that after the layoffs but they, once again, over hyped this. And with years, the more they overhype things the more the community gets over disappointed. 2016-2017 were the best years for this game in term of content release and communication: they really should look back at this period !
---
No, I'm one of those strange people that genuinely love collections, and consider it to be some of the best content.  I realize I'm in the minority, and I wouldn't, necessarily say that everything should be a collection, but I have a ton of fun doing them.
---
While I share the same feelings as you, do you think this announcement warranted a 45 minute event? I understand why people are disappointed
---
&gt; I'm actually a little excited after the announcement. Surely I'm not the only one?
---
No, i'm pretty excited too. I knew they would announce stuff about the living story; they did. That's what i care about, so i'm fine with it. And since i stopped paying actual attention to the constant doom, gloom, whine and cry in this subreddit, my blood pressure is way better too.
---
I think he bought those shoes on the gem store.
---
It is the movement system in WvW now. Moving around the map is something you spend a lot of time doing in WvW, which is why I consider it a large and important system to the game mode.
---
hobo necromancer
---
If they are appropriately challenging, have appropriate rewards, and have a hardmode they'd be very welcomed by everyone.
---
If it's just another Secret Lair of Snowmen though, that'll be content that everyone is done with in a heartbeat.
---
In raids if the teams wipes 2 or 3 times they disband... And they talk about commitment.
---
PoF also free?
---
Breaking news: Dragon we've known about for *over four years* still exists.
---
More at 11.
---
Around 2 years ago :)
---
TLDR, I started 2005 like u did, played gw1 until 2011, then gw2 from the betas. No I'm not happy with the lack of content in the game. And the lack of content announced today. I will keep myself busy with other games because I just cant anymore.
---
Meh it was pushed as a living world update. They have yet to release PvP or WvW updates as living world content so not sure why you are surprised.
---
Seriously I feel like the exciting hyped things they showed could have easily been tacked on to the end of the last episode similar to S2 &amp; 3. Holding a media event to basically say 'we're continuing to do the same similar stuff still' felt super weird. I wish they would have taken WP's suggestion of giving any sort of hint of a new expansion, no matter how meaningless it would at least give people a little more hype than 'heres more of the same'.
---
The doors right there. You're only hurting yourself if you stay here. I can guarantee if you dont like the game now, you'll never enjoy it again
---
People didn't overhyped. If anything, people weren't expecting much.
---
All they did was talk about things we already knew were coming. Build templates, Swiss tournament, wvw alliances, all of that we knew was coming. The only new feature is the strike missions, which also isn't what people wanted since it's a dumbed down "raid encounter". There was no mension of raids or fractals or any kind of challenging instanced content.
---
CD keys is not a legit seller.  You'll be lucky if you don't lose your account.
---
\*cries in bee\*
---
Now you know why gw2 marketing is so weird
---
This is the thing that playeres too often forget when it comes to games. ANet, the studio, the company, is not responsible for GW2, the people EMPLOYED at ANet are. Anet is a BRAND. Brands do not make thing, the people behind the brand do. 
---
There's a similar situation happening with Telltale Games, where two rich dudes bought the rights to Telltale's brand, and now all of games media is going around saying "Telltale is being brought back from the dead." No. This is not Telltale. This is the brand Telltale. Sure, SOME of the former employees (who by the way are STILL fighting a legal battle to get the money the original Telltale owes them) will be brought back, but it's going to be as freelancers, with the opportunity of full time employment dangled in their faces like a carrot of a stick. And that is not the same thing as Telltale being brought back from the dead. 
---
Point is, studios more often than not benefit from the perception that the brand makes the game, not the people, but this is clearly a case where it has actually hurt them. People expected the same level of content from the brand, but because of the layoffs and all the chaos they caused, the people behind the brand just weren't able to get everything out there. The people that have made content throughout the years have changed. People have left. People have joined. Teams have been shuffled around. Business decisions were made, some of which were bad, and those decisions that fall on the heads of ANet and NCSoft, and are what led to the layoffs. And I understand the disappointment, I feel it myself, but Matthew Medina is absolutely right in his point. To say this game is dead because the content we expected wasn't announced is to willfully ignore the work that this current team has done for season 5, which I'll point out is still likely only a fraction of what we'll actually see when it's released.
---
Did they fire all their good artists in Feb as well? This trailer looks like some high school art project Shit. Holy fuck!
---
Now that you mention it, is the dude to Rhytlock's right Braham with his mask on?
---
The problem was creating the hype before it. If they had been humble with a blog post, whatever, I feel people would of taken it more lightly. But inflating the hype like that when you have so little to show was a mistake.
---
No, thats not true. Outfits slowly killed the real Fashionwars long ago
---
The merchandising was fine. It was a promotional event for the game. They should be pushing their merchandise.
---
And that's why I don't like when companies try to play 'we are buddies' card. I don't really want to know Anet faces, their stories and feelings. They offer me a product and I will either buy it or not depending on its quality. Emotional blackmail is shitty. Just as was today's reveal.
---
None of his superiors liked his rapid rise in ranks because they don't like his no-nonsense maverick attitude.
---
The Charr legions are all about discipline and order, and Rytlock was always his own catcowman. They don't want someone like that in the higher ranks.
---
They never learn... Even after the layoffs, they double down on the same mistakes...
---
Don't buy HoT, they announced that if you purchase PoF as of now you will get access to HoT as well. If you purchase HoT you just get a glider and a stupid costume voucher.
---
I wonder if they'll consider the Freezie mission in Wintersday a strike mission, since it's seems to be basically what they describe strike missions to be.
---
&gt; high rewards 
---
AP amount since then begs to differ.
---
I hope it's something not trivial since 10 random players with proper combat experience are supposed to deal with them.
---
After HoT was released, Anet was very quick at announcing that they were already working on a second expansion.
---
After PoF, they have never said anything about it. Instead, we were told that season 5 would follow season 4 immediately, but with "expansion level features", and now we know that LW seasons were renamed as sagas, which kind of imply (IMO) that no expansion is going to be released.
---
WvW is that guy's "passion project" like the guy who designed the action camera mode.
---
I'll be honest, that short clip did just look like a dungeon boss from FFXIV to me mechanic wise and I am worried that's about as hard as they'll be.
---
But hey at least it's something.
---
So would I but the content will always be sub par at anet
---
I won't refute the validity of there being problems; but the alarmist doomsday-saying of this subreddit every time something drops is absurd. 
---
There are of course outlying well-articulated points, but in general it's the bandwagon whining.
---
Same, I really like these
---
Imagine YOU trying to represent something to the client looking like THAT. What could possibly happen?
---
I might be looking at it too positively, it just spurred a renewed interest in raids and a desire to to them again, but "we'll see" is a healthy outlook. They said they had four content creation groups instead of two previously, are they going to be having less focus on raids from the groups?
---
and bots, thousands of bot blocking dungeon servers
---
Let's see how they actually turn out. Could be "instanced open world" pseudo-raids combining lvl80 booster tech with Freezie mechanics design reusing minidungeons or pretty areas and decent rewards like a fully earnable weapon+armour set. Could just as easily be the same cookie-cutter bounties we've slogged through a thousand times, limited to 3-4 specific corners of the new LS maps and yielding nothing except a daily cap of 5 extra champ bags.
---
No hope was given so we good
---
Medina should understand that if anet cannot provide more than this then the game won't survive. The timeline calls for expansion features at this point. The game is simply stale and they never developed their evergreen parts of the game. (Wvw)
---
&gt;But hey at least it's something.
---
If it's not good, it will most likely sap even more resources away from Fractals and Raids.
---
It'll be the PoF character screen but blue
---
CAPE HYPE!
---
...
---
Wait, let's not jump on another hype train :(
---
Yeah a Roadmap would be nice.
---
As a new player you have tons of content to play and it's free so I would say try it out.
---
Anyone who has been with the game for a while should have grown immune to that by now. If not then they have only themselves to blame for failing to learn from the past.
---
Assnet will always be trash.
---
Ah righto. That makes it ok.
---
The only way to know is trying it.
---
You can play for free using the same account you use to play GW1.
---
What about the tiny adorable golem with the hat? Did he land a better job somewhere else?
---
&gt; Did you do PvP, WvW, fractals, achievements, raids, or any other part of the game? 
---
Not the OC but yes. I've done it all.
---
I just hope for some new challenging content. This season does look awesome though.
---
It just highlights the lack of care for PvP and wvw in this game - if there is only one pvp player in the crowd, what does that tell you about the game mode?
---
It’s stale, repetitive, and has been given little to no attention since the release of the game. Guild Wars 1, if it was still active, would be a better pvp game than guild wars 2...
---
That only comes out in episode 2. So 6 months from now?
---
There's about 1.5-2 years of content starting from square one playing at a casual pace. That's all the story content, a legendary or two, some achievements, etc
---
Literally! That was the only announcement I was hoping for. A roadmap, just a roadmap.
---
LITERALLY!
---
Classic WoW will have population and competition for PvP and FFXIV has the PVE content and raids. A true WvW replacement does not exist but I've played WvW since launch, I'm tired of the same game.
---
New armour set. yay!
---
As usual, Anet is light on details and has no timeline. 
---
I fully expect the game to be in maintenance mode within 12 months.
---
Fellow time travelers! Should we tell them?
---
[*Some people are too angry, seems.*](https://i.imgur.com/t8dtCw1.jpg)
---
I'm curious about the use of "saga".
---
To me, Season 1 to HoT was a saga. Season 3 to Season 4 was a saga.
---
The Mordremoth Saga. The Aurene Saga. The Icebrood Saga.
---
I think we'll see Jormag not just for S5, but expac3 and S6 or whatever form the next one or two storyline releases.
---
&gt;ANet: ~~Here's more of the same but we're calling them Strikes instead of Raids.~~ EASY MODE RAIDS GO GO GO
---
German here, the german version of Jormags voice doesn't sound female at all for me. Pretty sure it's a male VA but the voice sound got slightly altered. So my bet is both the english and german VA's are either males with a light voice or grannies that smoke 20 packs of cigarettes daily..
---
But just you wait til you see the other side (GW1 can rotate the camera in character select) [](https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/en/uploads/forum_attachment/file/119671/eye_of_the_north.jpg)
---
They are still going to have transfers with the alliance system IIRC.  I'm starting to think it won't happen (at least not before everyone quits) just because they obviously do not care about WvW in any capacity and allocate little to no resources there.
---
Its almost as if we’re customers purchasing goods.
---
PvP has been "getting Swiss" for 2 fucking years.
---
Two YEARS to get SWISS, and they're STILL making the same excuse of "a couple months."
---
Exactly. Just being able to duel someone wherever you are, no need to go to another map with enabled PvP spaces.
---
This doesn't appear to show up for vanilla accounts ( i've got a deluxe upgraded account from a ftp one) but my main account with both xp's it does...
---
Nope.
---
Look at games like Warframe, PoE, Wow classic X then look at GW2.
---
Try to apply some critical thinking, there is a scale of content delivery, engagement, difficulty and GW2 is as close to 1 as is possible for a lot of it.
---
Yeah, probably.
---
Surely I'll be back in a week &gt;:/
---
Classic seems nice, I just don't have the time investment to hit level cap nor the desire.
---
Doesn't make it okay, but that is where the industry is going. So you can either be a fucking pussy who bitches about this type of shit or just deal with it. Actual gambling is way worse and no one gives a fuck about that apparently.
---
I would say it is really likely that we will not see the end of season 5 if they continue to slap us in the face with every opportunity they get.
---
Honestly funko pops and leggings, how out of touch can anet get...
---
Well, if they emulate what FFXIV does which they really should considering this is just a trial fight, there should be two difficulties.
---
Normal, this is the one that pugs can easily do and requires no real set up but it does introduce some idea of the mechanics that will be seen in the next difficulty, Extreme.
---
Extreme: This builds upon normal while introducing some new mechanics while also using some previous mechanics from other fights (for example, markers that mean stacking on someone to share damage). Extreme is the difficulty below Savage raids (or just raids in GW2's case) and do usually require some degree of set up and player skill.
---
Slowpoke.  I'm already not using them!
---
I did not receive the email about Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns either.
---
Yeah, like, what the *fuck* was that?
---
That had to have been a non-trivial amount of time and effort put into that thing. 
---
For what?
---
They did, just to add some salt to the wound,  "We'll be happy to talk about world restructuring in the coming months" After we got no real update on it for a year and a half! (other than a blog post or 2 since that basically repeated what was first said)
---
This has been said so many times by countless GW2 fans, but it's still worth saying it; Fuck ArenaNet.
---
I only come back when expansions are released. Guess I have to wait again.
---
He calculated the likelihood of this event living up to the hype and decided not to come.
---
Yes, this would be perfect for me.
---
&gt;	It just is
---
Yep that summarizes GW2 for me. There's no new-ness. Its more of the same thing, refashioned from some existing thing and no matter how much lipstick you put on that pig, it's still a pig.
---
I was and kinda still am thinking it's drakkar.
---
taxi ad
---
A ray of light in these dark times ;_;
---
what is guild wars 1.
---
Yeah, that little attempt at humour was clearly the important part of my post. But I stand by what I said, we won't get to fight Bubbles.
---
Episodes currently cost money though. I think people are a bit confused, it's probably going to stay the same way as it is now, log in during the time period or pay later.
---
It would be a waste of time since it will get thrown out in a month or two anyway.
---
And there is a good example about why Arenanet is acting so blind when ignoring part of the community and their complains.
---
Mr. Molina, you've buried the foot in the wrong hole.
---
Making memes is all we can do to cope with the pain at this point.
---
There's a misreading in there. They didn't literally mean that release dates wouldn't be changed or anything else.  
---
The key parts of the phrase are:
---
* "Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 game **services** will not be affected" (emphasis mine) - Means that the Services themselves would not be affected. I.E. the games would still be up and running.
---
* "nor is any upcoming game content **cancelled**" (emphasis mine) - Be mindful about how they specifically say content is not *cancelled*, they never said content wasn't delayed, pushed back, etc just that it wasn't cancelled.
---
Why do I bring this up, because PR departments (AND internal technical teams) try carefully word things to prevent overly positive or negative assumptions from happening.
---
(un?)popular opinion: 'established' players would not be happy with anything that is simple and fast enough to implement to be remotely profitable and would help game grow or at least not stagnate.
---
New player. No verification email (tried a dozen timeas), no response from support, can't play without the verification link.
---
Is this normal? If I buy the game will they answer?
---
All of this dissapointment would be avoided, if Anet simply admitted: "*Hey, we had rought times. We're still recovering, took longer than expected, but know this - we will bounce right back to the top. Just give us more time*." and the community would be probably like "*It's okay, we love you*".
---
And it would be even better, if Anet communicated with the playerbase. 
---
Also - either lay offs had an impact on the company, or not. Pick your choice, Anet. 
---
We all know, that Anet is made of people. Stuff happens. Sometimes it's bad, sometimes it's worse. We all know that. People would be more sympathetic, if Anet didn't pretend like they are not bunch of humans creating the game. 
---
As for the customer part; we payed for the game, bought expansions, some of us even bought cosmetics for their characters.   
---
How can we invest our money in the game, that gives strong vibes, that it's gonna die soon? Like they are not making it as good as they claim?  
---
I would rather to take this money, and give it to Digital Extremes, who has much better communication with the playerbase, doesnt create hype for nothing, and reassures Warframe is stable.
---
Hyping the event, like something LARGE, FRESH and NEW is gonna happen, and then delivering Dissapointment Festival was a mistake. They wanted more marketing, and they overdid it.   
---
They baked a cake with of gloriously looking frosting, but the cake was in fact a sad layer. 
---
Anet wants to bounce back? Okay, but I'm not gonna spend more cash on gems, unitll I see it happening. Not after today's stream.
---
Why  not do the same with our current raid bosses?
---
"friendliest community" my arse.
---
:)
---
Same as before nothing has changed
---
They said they'd be discussing the alignment changes in the coming months.  That's all.
---
They already announced that the first strike mission is in the prologue and it will evolve after that in episode 1 and also providing another strike mission that is the horror type thing they were talking about. People just aren't listening
---
I mean, masteries at HoT were good until they were gutted. The fact raids get repetitive and boring after a while is the reason they can't take 9+ months to get released .. and you don't like them, but I do, me and apparently 17 thousand other people who came to watch the ERP. 
---
I also don't enjoy too much pvp in a MMO, but other people do, and I fight their fight like they fight my fight (pve endgame content). Just because I don't enjoy something doesn't mean it is right not to do anything about it.
---
I'm not interested in playing mmos primarily for story. I play single player games for that. I want group content, stuff that takes advantage of the mmo nature.
---
Don't blame Anet, blame the presenter.
---
I know there are people who prefer the Guild Wars 2 character screen, but this is the perfect opportunity to recover this old character screen. Also #nostalgia.
---
Thank you. I got blasted for saying this exact thing a couple days ago. Angry rabid white Knights were out in full force covering for Anet.
---
Stronghold: abandoned.
---
2v2 arenas added: but not in queues. Useless.
---
NEW HEART OF THE MISTS?!?! That literally no one asked for... the old one was better.
---
New maps?!?! Djinn’s special mechanic is literally better to ignore than attempt to get. Since it’s release, I have completely tuned out the voice line that says the mechanic is ready
---
Balance patches? Happens MID SEASON. EVERY SEASON. Why the hell would they shakeup the leaderboard HALFWAY THROUGH THE SEASON?!
---
PvP is completely unsupported. The devs have literally dropped support of anything but Conquest, which again, we have received little to no content for since the release of the game. I think we have like... 2-3 new maps? Since release? And no new game modes. No reason for any new players, or returning players, to come play pvp.
---
December 31st at 23:59
---
Nope. The game is trash.
---
The vocal minority is always so entitled..
---
Oh I agree they should.
---
Fun fact FFXIV has that also, except those are just raids. It goes raids -&gt; extreme trials -&gt; Savage.
---
Did they say it will have only two episodes? I remember them saying they have 2 planned for now which will be related to norn and charr cultural background but I assumed they would add more, no matter how I look at it I don't think they can finish it in 2 episodes.
---
well shit then ok. let's just hope with automated they mean an automated relinking system for alliances. right now they relink manually, don't they? And that's not really an option with the planned alliance system.
---
It might be a way to gauge interest for easy modes in an actual raid setting but who knows with anet
---
Sure, but the story never last more than a few hours at best. The maps have been pretty meh, needs better metas imo. Strike missions sounds good but for a vet since launch who does raids and t4 fractals, I'm afraid there will be no cm and the boss will not be a challenge.
---
Last I checked raids offered 3 full armour sets per weight plus over another sets' worth of individual skins, one full weapon set (White Mantle) and several sets' worth of individual weapon skins.
---
And let's not forget fractals still drop liquid gold like candy and most of the aforementioned skins, plus some extra boxes, come as ascended items. 
---
Plus if it's 1 per boss, 1 boss per existing map and 4 of those added per episode we should basically get that full set without exceeding the FX volume of S4.
---
Support is probably backed up with HoT refunds and speedy verification is probably not in the cards--buying it probably won't change that timeline. Identity verification is one of the slower tasks, they've said before. So I'd give it a day or two, or even a week.
---
I don't think new 10man bounties are a way to get new ppl into raids
---
That is what made me think it might be an expansion, but then they didn't mention it being an expansion. So yeah, if its paid episodes, no thanks.
---
Bye!
---
They overhyped it themselves. I stayed away from the general GW2 community hype, but seeing the size and the countdown definitely indicated a larger than "Saga" level of announcement. And almost nothing tangible in terms of new QoL apart from templates (still lacking a date).
---
A statement about the difference of season 4 and 5 would have been nice.
---
Well being in your late 40s doesn't mean that you cannot file a patent every now and then. Still even though big thing happened quite recently and will still happen (build templates for example), dreaming big like showing the gaming world what a true game is, is in the past.
---
The analogy was not directed at the game's health but at its attractiveness to the Great Outside.
---
Of course, they can reboot the game anytime and get a fresh start I guess. If they can and are willing to pull it: FFXIV was not going well when they relaunched it, whereas GW2 is going quite well so why bother?
---
Note: this isn't a season. It's a Saga. So quotes about the season don't apply.
---
I don't get why they can't even bring up a timeline. Like I'm not expecting "March 12, 2020 at 3PM PST". More like a "Hey aiming for spring-summer release hopefully". Just ANYTHING to actually look forward to and be like ok I should play more before X date to get all my sets in order or whatever the case may be.
---
Finally. Missed the last sale by a few days and have been waiting since.
---
Me too and I agree, problem is as always Anet can't manage expectations.
---
3PM PDT happens when this comment is 1 hour and 31 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/yvPnT9Aj_
---
I'm a bot, if you want to send feedback, please comment below or send a PM.
---
Maybe the new bosses will drop milling stones.  I know that would be spoiling the playerbase, but we gotta dream big!
---
You right.
---
Though this was what I was looking for, I'm pretty stoked.
---
“Feeeeeeel the hype of these things that we’ve already promised you 6+ months agooooooo...!”  -aNet, 2019
---
I don't know, maybe you like the game?
---
*fistbump*
---
Thanks friend.
---
I would be sitting here writing paragraphs upon paragraphs about the "main problems" of WvW.  Alliances will not fix most problems.  It will hopefully address population imbalances and will bring an end to the era where 1 server is just completely dominant.  I think there will still be population issues, but at least it's *something* changing for once, so a breath of fresh air.
---
Exactly this. It's so exhausting seeing people parrot the same incorrect 'AnEt SaId It WoUlDn'T aFfEcT gW2' takes.
---
Totally I am a marketing dude, sure obviously i am not lol :D
---
Excuse me, where did I say I was leaving?
---
You PVE players are so toxic
---
Looks like they changed it with the rework, I farmed over 2k *regular* peppercorn there over the past months but the wiki now only lists Cilantro and Sesame for the new stuff.
---
Last live event was on HoT announcement... Also expansion grade content during living world that was said like a year ago.
---
Not even GW1 was about guilds in wars.
---
To me it sounds like kind of a rebranding.... Nobody actually called it "Living World Season 5".  It's a saga now, from my opinion, because they don't seem to have a plan.  It's starting to look like they don't even know how long this is going to go for or what is after.
---
Well looks like we're getting that brother
---
&gt; Anet didn't hype shit up, you did.
---
- setting up a live announcement in a fashion of HoT
---
- 30 day heads up blogpost
---
- 40 hour live timer to get the attention and hype
---
- talking over the year how their new LW formula will bring expansion level features and showing nothing new during the announcement
---
Sure, Anet did nothing to pump the hype.
---
Also buy the merch.
---
DO NOT RESIST! BOOB BEEP!
---
To be frank I feel like they have exhausted my sympathy because they once again failed to deliver what the playbase wants-a simple road map of what concrete features are to come in all game modes. What was announced was nothing innovative, new skins, open world raid. They are more or less the same as what is already in game. They know VERY well the playbase is in desperate need of something exciting to look forward to because the road map has been asked soooo many times over reddit and official forum. It'd be very naive of them to expect most players would be satisfied with a simple season 5 announcement. A lot of players saw this as the last straw to decide if they'd stay, and Anet was aware of it. Yet this announcement just made it clear that they will continue dishing out low effort stuff and not put resources into WvW/Raid/PvP. You can keep saying that people are tripping but you will see the ripple effect of one person leaving leading to another, and in a few months how many people have already quit the game for good. I have spent thousands of dollars on this game for skins and whatnot, and have involved myself in both the casual and competitive scene; I reeaaally wished they'd come around and bring something huge to the table. There wasn't. I am not blaming the company or the devs or anyone at this point. I just accept that this is how it is and will no longer play this game anymore.
---
I'm not sure we watched the same thing
---
If you consider 10h every 3 months content so be it
---
Yeah true buy merch :O ! awesome stuff.
---
Which servers are stacked with guilds at the moment?  The only stacked server is BG and that's because everyone and their mom transferred there a few weeks ago.  They don't even really have many guilds that transferred, it's just hordes of pugs.
---
Yeah, it's certainly feeling like that
---
Some of you are really dumb for expecting anything. Why hype yourselves up like that? I KNEW it couldn't be anything big. It was impossible for it to be a new expansion. Fuck... Some of you are real dumb.
---
Exactly, so in reality the people that should have suffered for this blunder was the management group who allowed this crap to happen in the first place! Anet's leadership made this situation and they are still there, that my friends is the crux of the problem!
---
They allowed focus to move from their title franchise causing the drought suffered than they tried to play a three card shuffle with LW at a major venue and got caught red-handed.
---
Everyone is stressed and tired. 
---
But there are tons of studies that show that work quality goes down when employees experience things like layoffs (even those not laid off), are generally stressed, exhausted, etc.   
---
It's a simple fact. Development (game and software) takes a ton a brain power to accomplish and if I'm depressed, worried, exhausted, or otherwise negatively affected by things like layoffs, uncertainty, toxic customers, toxic managers, etc then my work will suffer as well.
---
That doesn't just "go away" because someone has a "job to do". This isn't the military or a hospital where lives are counting on me. If my manager or customer treats me like crap AND it becomes an on-going thing AND I'm not the only one experiencing it, then I'm going to either not care about my work or not be able to put my all into the work and make it good.
---
I'm not saying people can't criticize the devs, but be damn sure it constructive criticism and be mindful that they are people with their own stresses and issues as well.
---
I don't think people are pissed at the Devs, i think they are pissed at the PR muppet's who created Hypergeddon with a theatre booking, slot longer than either expansion announcement and even a 24+ countdown.
---
Im normally immune to hype and even I started to suspect it was going to be something big ( whilst still expecting a season 5 info light presentation)
---
Wait, the ritualist outfit? What's wrong with it! And, uhm, what about that other guy? Er, that one! Yeah! There's still more to talk about!
---
Any hub/node for the other comics? Saw a few of them but I just forgot they existed :I.
---
I don't know that they ever scrapped any actual work on a 3rd expansion but they pretty much said they abandoned the format for more LW with the only logical conclusion that is was life support for GW2 while they shifted over to Project X
---
Too bad. Peppercorn seems to be very rare.
---
Then don't leave? You answered the question yourself.
---
*hug*
---
Hang in there.
---
They called it a "special announcement event" multiple times, people jumping to conclusions was to be expected.
---
Anet should have seen this coming and clarified sooner.
---
No, people shouldn't have expected too much but it's completely understandable why they did.
---
Also, literally every thing they've announced since then is all they've talked about. 
---
From [Mike Z](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/69872/update-from-the-guild-wars-2-team);
---
&gt; The Guild Wars 2 team is still committed to bringing content and feature updates to the game. The next episodes of Living World are already in development, Swiss tournament support is coming to PvP, we’re looking at more WvW events coming soon, and the return of the Super Adventure Festival is imminent. Our long-term plans for the game like World Restructuring and large-scale improvements to quality of life are still in the works. 
---
It's alright to be a fan of the game and still be disappointed that \~6 months later they're regurgitating the same exact talking points. Oh except now, the large scale improvements to QOL is build templates coming soon™.
---
A wvw update that was requested?
---
A pvp update that was requested?
---
A fractal/raid update that was requested?
---
But they were at PAX anyway, which is always an opportunity.
---
And can you imagine what would have happened when you would have done like you suggested? People would call out ANets marketing for not using that opportunity. Whatever they do, somebody will always complain.
---
I get where you're coming from, but I feel pretty suspicious of that really being the case. At the end of the day, they are still a professional games studio and they would have been working on this for a long time now at this point, given their typical development cycle. I don't think they could afford to go in directionless.
---
It is, by definition, content. Whether you like the content or not.
---
Wow they made an update with a living world logo its almost if....most of their big game update have the living world logo in it. Woooooooooow how dare people get hype bc they think Anet would give content to other gane modes. Honestly you should be happy all these players are talking about leaving. More simgle player content for you.
---
More of the same in form of LW maps and story that you complete in 2-3 hours after release? Where are raids? Fractals?
---
Someone a casual noob.
---
Is it me or this thread is hidden from gw2 reddit?
---
Raids basically, or actual concrete information about more content than 'This is the new map for prologue. Episode 1 and 2 will have one map together and a Drakkar world boss plus two Strikes. This is a new type of PvE content called Strikes. The end.'
---
It's nothing concrete. It was so much fluff for so little actual information.
---
&gt; No, I'm one of those strange people that genuinely love collections, and consider it to be some of the best content.
---
Literally running around the open world pressing F or auto attacking your way to participation is such horrible content. I hope you don't take offense to this, but its a shame to see the incredible GW2 combat system gathering dust in a game where most of the players appear to simply want to press F and auto attack their way through the game. But I guess thats why we're in the place we're in talking about what we're talking about, right?
---
The feature is actually very well thought of.
---
It means that they won't have to create new raid wings and can save resources and focus more on actual maps.
---
The problem part is in the fact that they have admitted that they see these strikes as an entry point for the raid wings.
---
So it is safe to assume that these bosses will probably be easy and won't offer anything to the current raiding community.
---
If the bosses scaled up to a certain point just like in the Dragon Bash festival it could be pretty hype but I don't think this will be the case.
---
I know your pain, man.  
---
I very recently bought HoT for a friend from a retailer.  
---
I think the funny part is that I would have bought directly from the GW2 site, if their design was a little bit better. You are required to log in to buy it, which you'd think means it's going to auto-apply to the account you buy it on. And since I'm not going to play a speculation game about "will this auto-apply to my account when that's not what I'm trying to do?" or "what happens if I buy it again on an account that already has it?" and since I don't want to ask my friend for their login information when I'm trying to surprise them with a gift, I bought my copy from a retailer.
---
Now I realise after doing it this way, that when you buy it from their site, it just emails you a code.
---
But that information isn't apparent. And why is have me log in to do this, when the assumption from that is that it will auto-apply, especially when you're offering other addons below it that are typically something you'd buy for your own account, like character slots (which can't be gifted) and dye kits, etc? (I don't even know what happens here if you add those to your cart while buying the expansion. Are *those* going directly to *your* account? Or do you get some kind of code? Who knows!)
---
The expansion purchase area lacks clarity imo. Just add a gift option.
---
I can understand them not offering cold hard cash refunds for something we didn't buy directly from them. But it was a little disheartening to see that they went out of their way to explicitly exclude anyone who bought from retailers from *any* compensation whatsoever. Especially when their buy site is as unclear and buggy as it is.
---
Ah well, at least we got that veteran armor voucher...
---
Game's called Guild Wars 2 and it has nothing to do with guild, wars, or being a sequel. They could ditch the dragon plot in a heartbeat especially after what happened in S4, but here we go again..
---
Maybe you couldn't try not setting your expectations so stupidly high and blasting Anet for not meeting the demands you have in your head.
---
But you got MOUNTS!!
---
With SKINS!!
---
Aren't you happy?
---
Isn't the map thing just a way for them to put out less content?
---
"if you love the game at all" 
---
shut up lol
---
Look at it another way, it's something on the mind of the narrative lead who is pretty new to the company. I wouldn't be surprised if they were in the stages of story-boarding out what they wanted to do with Bubbles. 
---
In Cantha, obviously!
---
I've been pretty impressed with Julia. It seems like she knows her stuff about the franchise. It looks like they're handling Charr in the right way in the next episode. If they also treat Norn like actual Norns (not just big humans), then I'd feel like we're in pretty good hands.
---
the same reason why it took them three years to finally add guild halls, that also shouldve been in the game on launch and a ton of other features that you'd expect to be in the game in a triple A title, yet wasnt there.
---
the launch was rushed for gw 2.
---
I never even heard about Tidal before.
---
&gt; People flew out there for this and this is what they got?
---
Sorry - that is just ... not ANets fault. If this would have been a stand-alone thing, maybe. But heck, this is a game conference. Of course you go big there. You have to. It doesn't mean anything by itself.
---
You're justifying them holding a "special announcement event" to talk about literally the same exact things that [Mike Z talked about in Feb](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/69872/update-from-the-guild-wars-2-team)? Like at some point you have to maybe at least feel a little bit disappointed that the game isn't fulfilling its potential? Or will you just continue to get mad at people online to displace that disappointment?
---
Anet, we need to talk
---
I don't like art trailers. Yeah, it's nice, but I'd rather get a proper gameplay trailer, or at least something done with the game engine.
---
The HoT announcement trailer was great: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOUk2y0K2m8 (and far better than the artsy cinematic they did for release)
---
I’m not excusing it. I’m simply saying that some people are very understandably upset, but should consider that if the game is making them unhappy they may want to back away for a bit to let things settle. It’s easy to get swept up in all of the negative emotion swirling around right now, and I think we all need to be objective and determine whether it would be healthy to continue playing if we’re too strongly affected. I am encouraging patience and introspection, not necessarily unwarranted optimism.
---
Fucking hell...
---
OK I'll bite. 
---
Warclaw stomp. Imagine you are 5 guildies vs 20 and your mate goes down. The enemy group has multiple downs and it's a rally war. You as the FB starts casting signet of mercy to reset the momentum; out of nowhere a mounted player from the enemy server, who more times than not has been mounted since the beginning of the fight I.e. contributing nothing, swoops in and mount stomps your guy. Boom. You are down to 4 players, enemies ress themselves and you lose the fight. There is no counter to warclaw stomp other than ressing faster than getting stomped, not even stealth, which counters player stomps. Add insult to injury it's an aoe stomp. 
---
Warclaw health and three dodges, in a PvP environment. No explanation necessary, I hope? 
---
Warclaw being locked behind pof. Now the same can be said of gliding, but then again gliding should also have never made it into WvW either. 
---
Being able to mount up anywhere, whether your server owns the territory or not. At least you could only glide if your server owned the territory. 
---
Difficult to dismount, only possible on a few builds. I don't think avoiding getting ganked is a positive thing, in a PvP environment. Why are you in WvW if you want to avoid fighting other players? Fighting other players is a fundamental aspect of WvW, and should not be discouraged by the addition of mechanics that can be used to actively avoid a big aspect of the game mode. Many players use the mount as a means of avoiding combat, the same can be said of gliding. 
---
PvP balance is good? I have to disagree. The same two builds have been played since the inception of pof (fb scourge) since they are so oppressively op. The winner of the EU 2v2 tournament was fb + scourge. The core of the WvW meta is fb + scourge since the beginning of pof. Monthly AT winning comps include fb + scourge. There's a underlying pattern here of stale, boring two class meta.  Chaotic interruption being disabled in PvP does not make up for years of poor and questionable balance decisions. Since HoT the game is just on a never ending trend of powercreep, with not much being done to address it. 
---
As for WvW balance...I would take those 10 devs who really spend time in all aspects of WvW (roaming, GvG, blob fighting) any day, the problem is such team never has and will never exist. When met with a problem do you give up before even attempting the fix it? Because that's what you're saying here. WvW balance is a complete clown fiesta in its present state, the worst that it's ever been in for certain; but all we get are 15% sic'em nerfs (which does nothing to one shot ranger specs), deleting an entire spec (chrono), and what is Anet working on? Oh yea, a new mount skill, which is "content" that will surely improve WvW. s/
---
This brings me to the core issue of balance. Instead of fixing the core issues surrounding balance, Anet's policy is that of overbuffing something else that counters the originally op spec/skill/mechanic; failing this, they just straight up delete the offending spec/spec/mechanic. Not only is the original issue never fixed, they've compounded the problem by making new ones.
---
So far people trying to defend a company like if it's their friend or something...  
---
THEY ARE NOT OUR FRIEND! We are their cash cow!
---
As in deus ex machina (I hope i used that phrase right) something that comes in last minute to make the stort all ok basically
---
I mean, if they wanna presentsomething, they gotta give time for people to plan to go see the presentation.
---
Believe it or not, this presentation wasnt nothing to other people, this whole thing has been worth the hype, it's exactly what I and lots of other people wanted. Hes not wrong to treat the creators with some empathy.
---
I get the disappointment, but I dont share the sentiment
---
And the final instance took place in a dragon corrupted area featuring Kralky.
---
That isn't even remotely equivalent.
---
I think you misspelled wordpress acounts omegalul.
---
I just bought it through dlgamer and once I redeemed the code both PoF and HoT became active in my account.
---
1. There is a reason Devs are generally shielded from the customer. We use Product Owners, Managers, and Directors to shield us from the customer and focus on our work. It's intentional.
---
2. You may not be shitting on the devs, but there are a LOT of people who are.
---
3. It doesn't matter if *you* or *I* think we're shitting on the devs. It matters if the *devs* think they're being shitted on. It *will* affect their quality of work if they perceive the community doesn't appreciate them..... much in the same way the community will think the devs don't care right now.
---
Of course isn't, I am being sarcastic tho
---
At least you've got the letter.
---
They just focus on the most casual and shallow of PvE in a game that has amazing combat.  Such a shame.  It really has to go back to the game director, right?  Mike O'Brien never seemed to like the more competitive modes.
---
At this point, any living world stuff is mostly to push some sort of new monetization; outfits, mount skins - always something. 
---
The game is dying, bleeding players to FF14 and WoW classic. Why? Because those games offer what some would call content. more than 45 minutes every 3 months. 
---
At this point i wouldn't be surprised if internally, gem store trash was considered content. 
---
"But muh story" Killing Zhaitan sucked, Mordremoth was a push over and Kralkatorik rolled over like a baby. None of the so called villains feel strong, or dangerous. By all means appeal to the casual audience who don't want to have to think to kill a god, but don't expect people looking for substance to stick around. 
---
I've stopped playing. I come back every 3 months for a few days, then stop playing again. I am playing other MMO's with worse combat and riddled with rep grinds simply because, like many I am sure, I want to have a game that I can sink years into.
---
The only thing you can sink into GW2 as it stands is your credit card number. Unfortunate.
---
Problem with Cantha is that it would be another human focused story. They wanted to do a story with the Norn and Charr
---
Literally the only new information they gave was:
---
Prologue on 17th with new map.
---
Episode 1 and 2 will have 1 map together, Drakkar world boss (thats by far not done yet) and a Strike each.
---
Strikes are a new PvE gamemode for 10 players.
---
That's all the new info they gave in 40 minutes.
---
They ended their big live stream wirh leggings and funko pops and you people to give more money? Sit your clown ass down
---
Neither the other 500 crafting update or other rune updates had been part of an expansion.
---
In fact the bloody cooking even was tailored for overpriced monetarization via cash shop
---
They wasted our time and they keep wasting our time thats why
---
The main thing that I want which I am not confident is even in the works is elite specs.
---
That and some sort of improved wardrobe system to save cosmetic configurations.
---
Yo Dawg i herd you like alliances
---
That's a fair point, I think it's all an exciting direction for the game but to each his own
---
The table is also on another table.
---
You just have to be decent for most of the solo stuff. Same a bit for story dungeons, but they tend to use old raid boss mechanics for dungeon boss mechanics. The second you enter trials or the current dungeon content, it takes a step in difficulty, with mechanics stepping up in difficulty as well since you can't outgear it too much. Current normal trials (done for story) tend to be a bit more difficult than dungeon bosses and can actually cause wipes quite easily if people screw up or you don't have the DPS.
---
The second you enter into a current endgame raid or EX trial, the gloves are off, and there will be numerous mechanics you need to adjust to and memorize or else you will die or debuff the party causing everybody to take more damage. There are no enrages for normal. When you enter into a Savage raid, the boss practically screams "THIS ISN'T EVEN MY FINAL FORM!" as it throws upgraded versions of mechanics that WILL cause party wipes and guaranteed death at you, and even combines a few for you to do. All while you quickly try to kill the boss before its enrage destroys the party.
---
Anyone know if they showed any images of the new armor set? I thought I was watching but maybe not carefully enough?
---
Buy one you’ll actually use. I made Xiuquatl and I play scourge. I always use it and seldom reskin it. My boyfriend made Nevermore because it was his favourite/he loved how it looked. But he has no characters to use it on so it sits in his bank looking pretty for no one. Legendaries are to be shown off, otherwise you might as well buy TP weapon skins for ascended gear.
---
The marketting was and remains terrible.
---
The Ritualist outfit on Asura is very sexy-clothes-esque, which the FBI guy is highly opposed to.
---
There is a directory to all our new comic installments on the pinned post in our own sub Reddit at https://www.reddit.com/r/PortraitProphecies/comments/brzb62/welcome_to_the_gallery/

Bold of you to assume I'm a PVE'er.
---
What Anet needs is better communication, a roadmap would be a simple way to achieve this, they could also just give us dates for updates for example say wvw alliances coming November 2019 on the roadmap and then if it gets delayed tell us and give us a new estimated release date. This would be a much better option than the current "alliances are coming we'll talk about it more in the coming months" and then a couple months pass and all we get is "alliances are coming we'll talk about it more in the coming months". Obviously this wouldn't solve all the issues but better and more open communication about wvw/pvp/fractals/raids/general balance would go a long way to address a lot of the current frustration.
---
The point is that even if the game shuts down tomorrow he still got 3k hours of fun for what he paid for. Also the idea that spending time playing a game is an "investment" when it was just time spent having fun. People need to get over this idea that putting hours into a game means something more. All games eventually reach a point where they start to decline as better game engines emerge. Enjoy them while they last and move on to the next one.
---
What would be the point of GW1 Classic when they still support GW1 and it’s basically the same game.  Just to reset the economy and amount of ectos/ambraces people have hoarded? 
---
It’s different for wow cuz it’s literally a different game then when it first came out.  Gw1 is still and will always be gw1.
---
Like, if you want to play without heroes or do everything in order, and only play with other people who do that, you can cuz it’s 100% instanced content and you play at your own pace and rules.
---
Exactly, how do we even know those features even started production? It's just sad.
---
This inventory is making me really anxious...
---
I agree with this. Part of the problem too was the constant "Oh, and one more exciting thing!" that kept getting people's hopes up throughout the stream, even though they had actually already led with the best stuff.
---
&gt; LIVING WORLD announcement
---
why did they announce other things than living world then? build templates and MERCH OMG DONT FORGET THE FUCKING MERCH
---
That's..... That's not how you do it. I understand they need moral support, but that was a giant waste of money that may backfire. Had them being more open to us in blogs or posts, we could give more support than this dead end of a overhyped event.
---
I don't know if you watched the stream or not, but there was no silence.
---
Probably they already started preparing the expansion that will follow LS5.   
---
This content may have been "almost" ready before the layoffs so now they just need to deploy it carefully to get enough time to prepare what will come afterwards
---
I thought this was mesmer.
---
Of course, After 2014 wvw league community split due to "free transfer" that happened, So basically I did quit WvW after the league since some of drama that actually happened. (:
---
So I'm supposed to buy and play their game content because I take pity on them? What even is the strategy here? They themselves hyped this thing up, and while it doesn't look like bad content, we're all just wondering why the fuck it was hyped like an expansion.
---
Also, Anet shed it's employees because it wasn't releasing profitable content. What were they doing with such a massive workforce for two years?
---
I'm sorry, but "be grateful they did their best" is a pretty bad sales pitch.
---
I came for large-scale group content true. When I wanted instanced content GW1 was much better (well it still would if there still were groups).
---
Wow why are you being so toxic?
---
PLEASE BE HE HERO WE NEED YOU TO BE
---
 I WANT HALF NORN
---
No, people are not dumb. Nobody expected an expansion announcement. ArenaNet put themselves into this position again when they announced the even a month ago. Besides, you don't really rent a whole theater for showing nothing extraordinary. They didn't have to announce anything just drop a little hint, Z could have said: Look, we promise, the new Season will be expansion-level content but in the future we would not like to give up shipping out new expansions so be tuned for that too! That's all. Now people are disappointed because they righly feel that the game will from now on only ship episodic contents just like during the 2 previous years. If that's the case the viability of the game can be questioned. That's why people expected SOMETHING. Not necessarily an instant announcement but something to shake things up. I think it's not so difficult to understand so maybe you shouldn't call people dumb without adding some context to it.
---
I think the "public mode" is the answer. They can just jump in and see.
---
I just hope the organized mode is actually somewhat difficult or has multiple difficulty tiers.
---
They don't respect our time and dedication, not inside the game, and not outside the game.
---
I'm a little bit more satisfied on the WvW aspect just from reading this. It tells us some details about where Alliances is at, and what they're actually thinking about in terms of gameplay design for WvW systems. Why couldn't they have dropped the merchandise section and covered this? It would have gone a long way.
---
This is where I am. Just home from work, watched the announcement with hope that it would stoke me enough to log back in again. It didnt so I will continue adulting I guess.
---
Well, seasons were free if we had the last expansion. What about "sagas" ?. Maybe it's that the expansion-like feature, the pricing.
---
Thank you for putting my current feelings into words. In addition to what you said, i'm not mad at the devs. I work with some devs right now at a SaaS company. I know how hard they work, i know the struggles they face. I blame the leadership team at ANet for making the decision to make this an event instead of a blog post. I blame them for the way the game is heading and the layoffs that happened. 
---
I get where Matthew is coming from but to try to frame it like we're mad at the devs is missing the point. We're mad at ANet as a company and their leadership not at the individuals busting their asses following orders.
---
I am in a guild that does training and raiding I just have not been able to gear myself for raid. I don't have the time to grind for the gear so I am looking forward to this. I guess that means I am a casual. I have been playing on and off since release and find myself playing other games with my spare time instead of grinding gear.
---
I just want to look like that Charr at 2:32 already! 
---
I am so HYPED!!!
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
Of course, but employees taking responsibility and never saying a word about their problems doesn't help our cause at all.
---
&gt;     More than 4 episodes and 4 new maps!
---
If LS5 is only 4 eps, I will be very happy. Expansion in 2021 I wish.
---
I mean hey guild wars 2 isn't a charity or having a leash on your neck tied to a fence to keep you here or anyone. If you don't like the direction it's going some will leave and some will stick by. That's a true fact and I am sad to see that happen.
---
it's not medium armor without a buttcape
---
 Don't be so toxic :s
---
Mobile apps pay better.
---
Wild guess: they intended to release an expansion after Season 4, but decided to break it down in small smarts and rebranding it as Living world.
---
This also happened to me. I submitted a bug report.
---
Open world content would be fun if you actually could fail, and had to do something else than spam 1.
---
Sounds fun to me. But not something you should be announcing at a live event. They goofed up.
---
If they had made this announcement just a blog post with a trailer and then hinted towards some sort of huge important release at some point in the future for us to hype about, instead of hyping us up for pretty much just build templates and story episodes, that would have been much better.
---
Someone else on the sub said that the countdown timer was more exciting than the stream, and I kind of agree with that :/
---
When does this actually start?
---
Any idea when this starts?
---
yea my history is nice against some toxic dude =) he's gone finally
---
The problem here is that they hyped people with the event just to show some teaser trailer.
---
I'm thinking that each episode will have an individual price, but it will regularly show up as a discounted bundle in the Gem Store, like they've started doing with the other seasons. They did reassure us that there is not going to be a subscription model, so that's a reassurance.
---
"that sounds like the easier version of something we have"
---
Well, in their favor quite a lot of people asked for easy mode raids so... XD
---
Before someone points it out, ye I know that strike missions aren't easy mode raids, but honestly. If you don't care about the fights, but just the instance itself, search a video of the encounters to see the dialogues etc and go into any of the free "finished instances" that you can find almost daily in the LFG for the extra scattered lore.
---
I think they mentioned it'd roll out in a few weeks.
---
I've long ago accepted that the game will never be at its full potential, or used to its full potential. I'm trying to help people come to my conclusion.
---
&gt; This is not a call for general profession feedback. 
---
&gt; What are your concerns with this set of changes?
---
I am rather confused.
---
Thief is the best stealth class. Nerf thief stealth please. It's too strong.
---
It's so strong that it manages to stealth past balance changes, no matter how badly it may need it.
---
Yes, at least for me, since it basically means another few months of nothing to do in the game.
---
Maybe special tokens to buy a new set, or an option to buy unidentified gear with those tokens.
---
Roadmaps are only bad if you're dumb and not leave months of margin for safety, letting you handle both delays and cancellation announcements with enough time.
---
All businesses have roadmaps, which the clients follow to see how their money is being spent. Not having one is bullshit.
---
That's how I ride my warclaw, you're the one making it weird
---
&gt; With the living world and ONLY the living world logo attached to it, nothing more, nothing less
---
&gt; Like if i talked about WvW map design here. Which part of the title would make you think I'm gonna talk about that?
---
All types of content updates are for a long time tied to LW patches - raids, fractals, wvw, pvp. LW is not just story, it's everything currently, since there are no expantions coming.
---
&gt; Like every live thing thus far?
---
&gt; Like every LW teaser thus far?
---
LW trailers are released a week before the patch.
---
&gt; Like probably 50% of all the streams on twitch?
---
for big stuff only, this wasn't big stuff, this was a trailer and merchandise promo
---
&gt; This is the only thing i maybe agree with, though they did say the maps will be "dynamic", there will be a prologue and idk what else you want in your DLC besides more content? I think more armors and bigger maps is a given. If it's not a quality product well bash it, but jumping to conclusions doesnt do shit
---
They didn't really show any content either, just a trailer, mostly concept arts and badly rendered cutscene. That clearly shows
---
they have not much of upcoming content even ready for testing, everything will be rushed between releases.
---
Not to mention, compared to previous LW season, the only expansion feature we didn't get through LW patches yet were elite specs. Considering this season is supposed to be equivalent of expansion I share the sentiment new specs were valid expectation from the community.
---
Somewhere next week
---
Exactly. I am perfectly fine and and excited for what was announced.
---
It's just, when you hype up something the way it was hyped up, announcement for an announcement a month in advance, a live countdown days before the announcement, then the community expects something monumental, earth shattering.
---
ANet blew the hype WAY out of proportion for what they had to show for us.
---
I wonder if they wrote a query to check how many accounts had all these skins unlocked as well as HoT to see how many accounts would not benefit one bit from this gift.
---
Someone wrote "they're not required to give us anything".
---
True.
---
But if you are going to give us something, at least make it have some purpose. The glider was awesome, for example.
---
They did hype this up more than your average Living World update, so yeah they hyped it up.
---
How are the graphics? Are they still worse than vanilla Skyrim when played on a laptop?
---
I really fucking love it, people think this will be any amount of content. What this will be is just the fight arena from Dragon Bash but with a new skin. Its aimed at casual players so the rewards (if any) will be none existent. And sure I'm going to guess a ton of people will yell 'idk about rewards" but you fucking do, nobody uses their time for no gain, its useless.
---
Good. At least there's a part that still values their money. Every customer should act entitled, because they are. Game dev and hardware are the only industries where the majority of zealot sheep identifies with the company and defends them for underdelivering.
---
Theres an occasion for everything, but not everything is for every occasion
---
Ummm, I wasn't the one to reserve a hall and announce a stream a month in advance in a fashion eerily similar to when they announced a freaking expansion, was I? It's not my job to manage expectations, it's theirs.
---
And giving No content or at least an Outlook of what to come to a huge chunk of your Playerbase is helping Generating that income in what way ?
---
I went for the free swag and had the last ls spoiled for me. Oops
---
&gt; They never said that, but okay. ;)   
---
 Reading comprehension. Compare both quotes. 
---
You didn't bother to fact check and talked down on others.  
---
But he is the asshole?
---
What does it does/did?
---
Then they should have confirmed there is an expansion coming sooner than later. I'm not playing for two years without new expansion level stuff.
---
Hey now, you can _pick up boxes_ in SC now!
---
gw2 has all the tools and systems for making their raids/fractals scene shine above all other mmos, but anet wastes this potential throughout years
---
&gt; Hey since youre so smart what does leggings and funko pops have to do with living world. 
---
Anet is getting pretty close to actually doing some marketing, same thing you people were bitching about months ago. What does it have to do with LW? Nothing, it was thrown in, it was an add, does people wearing merch bother you that much? But no, its all about:
---
&gt; Why mention armor skins for pvp, alliances are coming #soon 
---
Because they just wanna get you off their backs. The best thing i can compare you to are AAtrox elitists in league of legends. The champ got reworked and the company now ignores anything aatrox related because of how toxic they are. Same with WvW, if you made the COMPANY money and werent toxic, you think they would still? 
---
&gt;Asking for content is toxic?
---
No, being toxic about it is toxic instead of just leaving and finding a better game. That's not sarcasm, why haven't you found a better game? Legit better.
---
&gt; Why rent out a theater at pax just to annoce a living world patch that could have been summed in a 1 page dev post or a 10 min youtube vid 
---
Why not, its LW hype, if you find the LW stuff boring, fine, but it doesn't sound like you care too much ab lw, but about the rest that was/wasnt in the announcement.
---
I must say im on this boat too. Its possible ez mod raids are good thing but how they talked about it its just sad.
---
Have an upvote for making us think instead of making us angry.
---
If there was an announcement for elite specs at the end of the stream, none of this would have been a problem, oh one can only hope.
---
receipts plz
---
I am patient person unlike part of this community. If there won't be expansion-like features at the end of S5 then I will admit that I was wrong. For now I will wait.
---
Maintenance mode..  confirmed (?)
---
If you're a furry yeah.
---
This perfectly summarizes how I felt during the stream.
---
Oh no im glad people are leaving. I hope more people wake up and realize that Anet only cares about living world and gem stores item. Hopefully this live stream is helps people realize that and they move to a better game.
---
&gt;They also recognize that they need to make it so winning in WvW actually means something, but without requiring 24/7 coverage.
---
Sad thing is that they already said this at least 5 years ago.
---
Alliances also were announced 2 years ago. That's outrageously slow.
---
*claps*
---
They mean, don't go to the thread to say "necromancer bad!!" or "ranger op!!", they want feedback on those specific changes.
---
I thought that was Thief.
---
You go fuck yourself, too.
---
They spent 2 years and millions on PvP when they tried to make it a pro e-sport. They have added 3 maps, Stronghold mode, as well as changes to some of the old maps. I think PvPers (me included) really have no ground to stand on when talking about not getting enough content.
---
Feels like the community trying to stay alive and anet trying to drown it. In Merch and other crap we dont care about when the game is the way it is.
---
Stupid, sexy Jason
---
Yeah dude cuz that was definitely what I was talking about and not the Living World stuff which is absolutely content.
---
Are you kidding? Announcing the announcement 30 days beforehand and booking out a theatre? This could have just been a post on their website.
---
What exactly did having an announcement event achieve over just posting it online?
---
I don't really get what are you trying to say. You can have friends at ArenaNet but ArenaNet is not your friend. You can feel compassion or sympathy towards anet employees but you shouldn't towards the company - because ArenaNet is not a person. In the video, the author says don't go after the employees because they're just trying to do their job - instead punish company for shitty maneuvers by voting with your wallet.
---
Living world in its current form isn't even a unique selling point any more. Both WoW and FFXIV do exactly the same, continuing the story with patches every 3 or months between expansions, and they have been doing it for the same amount of time or longer than GW2. The original premise of the living world was that it would change the game world over time. But what we got since HoT is completely walled off, independent, time frozen maps that have no interaction with the rest of the world at all (apart from occasional limited time current events). The living world selling point died with season one, and without that the game doesn't have much to go on except it's fun combat, and that's going to feel stale with no new elite specs.
---
TBH i do not give a crap about living world stuff.  
---
I'd rather have their team polish the game's current content or add more raids and fix wvw,pvp and fractals first before releasing the next chapter at least.  
---
There are several areas in competitive modes like PvP and WvW and raids that left much to be desired and promised long time agp.  
---
Build template is one of them but even that was just merely mentioned.  
---
So basically everything that is not living world is what most people like to get updated,balanced,polished and added.  
---
Instead Anet focused 100% on living world. SO no wonder people are not happy.
---
I have over 5000hrs in GW2, mostly in open world. I already appreciate what we have. I occasionally just tour maps on mounts I already full completed. I even try to find way to mix up the gameplay, like only playing in first person camera action mode. Play as a gun character and treat it like a first person shooter (some first person hand/weapon models would be nice).
---
&gt; I don't think most games should have enough content for 4k+ hours
---
Tell that to the people still playing TF2, WoW, and Minecraft
---
I JUST WANTED THE DEEP SEA DRAGON MATTHEW.   
---
lol, no, I don't get the big deal, but I am also not very invested in the game compared to some people. Like, I love the story, and I log in to play it, so more story always excites me. Sometimes, with those stories, I get a weapon set or armor set that I HAVE to have (like s5ep4-5). I play enough time to get what I want on the toons I want it on before I bounce. I also love the engineer class, and I will log in for balance changes to test them out and theory craft.  
---
I think the hype train is the problem. Never board the hype train and you will never be disappointed.
---
I didn't and yes he is.
---
I would be more excited if I thought we were going to talk more about Jora; that would be really exciting. The reason I linger on Eir is because I think she has more room for potential than was ever used.
---
&gt; But is that going to be another excuse to ignore the norn? This has been the norn’s story this entire time!
---
Didn't you see a mix of charr and norn in the trailer? They will be part of the story, they talked mostly about charr due to the prologue being about them. Also charr becoming icebrood is a novelty worth mentioning, unlike sons of svanir we already know exist. The very presence of Drakkar implies heavily norn related story.
---
&gt; Eir should be a part of this story. 
---
How can Eir be part of this story, while being dead?
---
&gt; Is she going to be relegated to Snaff’s place as a plot device?
---
She already was in that cutscene in Sun's Refuge
---
Destiny's Edge in general is neglected in current stories, mostly due to bad casting decisions, making it hard to get their prominent voice actors efficiently in place
---
I agree. Different people have different priorities, and for me the biggest problem is finding a reason to do anything in this game other than story mode.
---
Yes, you can do raids and collect materials, make legendaries... But they have the same stats as ascended. So why do you farm your gear for? WvW and PvP are a mess, PvE raids just for the sake of raids is silly, and so besides story mode there is nothing left to do. My wife and I played for almost 3 years and it hurts to see this game in this state, but we haven't played in almost a year now. Simply because there's no motivation for us to play. There is no end game. There is no sense of progression for our characters. And yes I am aware people play fashion and that's fine... But I want end game content and gameplay, and something to make me feel that my time in this game is not wasted.
---
These are perhaps fundamental problems that I don't quite know how to fix at this stage of the game, some of these are not even exclusive problems to GW2. It's 7 years old on an old engine, and there may be nothing fresh that I can expect... To be honest I was secretly hoping for a GW3 on an updated engine, but with their budget and staffing I wonder if it's even possible.
---
Because they *actually said they were going to fucking update us in the next few days*.
---
The funko presentation was from NCSoft, not from ANet.
---
You have no idea how much merch does for a company's PR. 
---
I do agree about easy mode raids being fucking cancer.
---
Alliances were kinda requested by the hardcore audience more so if it blows up in their face it's what they asked for, everyone makes mistakes...
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Oppressive_Collapse
---
Well the website literally couldn't handle the traffic after it announced the expansion part so I guess it worked to some degree.
---
As a newer player who doesn't own the expansions, I did appreciate this. I do agree though that there didn't need to be a hyped up event for what they announced. I was cool just looking at the youtube trailer.
---
The SubREEEdit is populated with people who hate the game and want to see it die.
---
Just giving them money isn't going to being more content into the game.  Just because they have money doesn't mean it goes back into the game.
---
Clearly today they are spending what they have putting out merch and gem store stuff...   Buying that stuff will just prompt them to do more of the same.
---
I'm glad all the comments here are exactly what I expected. ^:D
---
&gt;Sure some more people left because their friends had to go
---
Gonna tell you right now, those people volunteered because they saw the writing on the wall and chose to leave while the company still had money to offer them a severance package.  
---
People who choose to ride this out till the end are going to left holding the bag and a resume that showed their last place of employment was a company that eroded into obsolescence.
---
this dude is such a cuck lol
---
did he **really** ask what's more important to me between actual game content for the game i play or a presentation?
---
like chill out dude you're not doctors without borders or the red cross or something..you provide a product for money
---
Pretty sure (hope) it means we will return to 2-3 months between episodes instead of 4-5 because they won't create a new map everytime. But hey maybe not.
---
I found it in the gemstore, it is listed in my purchase history, but I am not able to wear it?

Women tend to spend more on videogame microtransactions than men in almost every game genre. Videogame companies realizing this is one of the biggest reasons lots of companies have tried to change their game style or game community to be more appealing to women. From random vague internet sources I think I can confidently say that somewhere between 20% and 40% of GW2 players are women.
---
My money's on "egotistical asshole who thinks the Charr have gone soft," and I wouldn't be overly surprised if he ended up being the Joko of this season. Rytlock replacing him would be an odd narrative choice, but I suppose it's entirely possible in the grand scheme of things.
---
Bye.
---
Both them today HoT free with PoF purchase!
---
One of the clients in the audience was a giant choya
---
I don't think they've done anything with the graphics, depending on when you played last, they introduced an Outfit system to overlay your Armor letting you look however you want.
---
But I don't mind the graphics personally
---
&gt; All those things are features natural game polish brings. 
---
Exactly. Those are all QOL or polish. None of them are content.
---
In damage control mode
---
Oh, that's who that was, nice. I thought it might be this season's version of the Commander, but apparently not.
---
Right, whining on Reddit every other week is the paramount definition of patient.
---
Don't worry buddy. I'm with you. But the subreddit is a negative circle jerk. There was people happy with it in game.
---
Oh for the love of fucking Christ.
---
Actually - I exactly know what I want - great stories, new expansions, new maps, new mechanics, guilds that promote team play, better game engine (DX9 is **17 years old** and works like shit) and more satisfying in-game rewards (I don't mind Gem Store that much though)... I would be excited even if we were to get another Feature Pack some time in the near future tackling only the engine problems.
---
Rytsock Blundstone
---
Corporate cuckoldry in action, folks . . .
---
Sadly the light one of all things looks weak
---
In complete agreement with everything you said. As someone who has been playing for almost all seven years of the game's life, I have never been so un-inspired to play the game. 
---
I will say though, it looks like the addition of these strike team things (whatever they're called) are a move in the right direction in terms of repeatable content. At least some part of living world will have value that way.
---
Players who log into your game for a few hours every few months aren’t core players.
---
I have to ask... Why did you feel like you had to prove how many hours you've played for? I don't want to take awya from your thoughts, I'm just confused on this one thing.
---
Hm... let's see... off the top of my head...
---
* Tengu
---
* Cantha
---
* New lands never visited before.
---
* More elite specializations.
---
* New weapon types
---
* Merge the concepts of dungeon and story, so story missions with good potential get a "Dungeon mode" version scaled for larger parties.  Getting more than twice the content for less than twice the resources used.
---
* [Dungeon rework](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/118044/#Comment_118044):
---
 * Story path inserted as part of the actual story, like how Arah story became Victory or Death. 
---
 * [Vanquisher mode](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/889386/#Comment_889386)
---
 * [Fractal dungeons](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/823073/#Comment_823073). There's 25 explorable paths. There could be a button in the fractal panel to access the current dungeons, and they would be T1 fractal dungeons. Then there would be T2, T3 and T4 fractal dungeons with improved rewards.
---
* Slow down a tad the pace of the combat and tone down noisy the visuals, helping new players and spectators see what's going on. 
---
* Tools for new players to train and learn PvP, like learning challenges, vs AI matches, death cam, replays, etc...
---
* New PvP game modes. For example:
---
 * Champion Escort: Each team gets 5 'lives'. The escorting team channels on an object and that summons a mists champion. They have to escort the champion to the enemy base before the time runs out, reaching 4 checkpoints in the route. If the champion is killed, they can summon another in the farthest checkpoint they reached, until they run out of lives; each player can channel their champion only once (after they channel and get the champion they lose an effect), and the same champion can't be summoned twice. If two players have the same champion selected, a random one is picked instead when the second tries to channel it. Then the teams switch and the enemy has to do the escort. Defeating a champion would give 100 points, getting to a checkpoint would give 100 points, defeating players would give 5 to 1 points the father from their base they are when they died. After both turns, whoever got more points wins.  
---
* Stronghold improved to work more like a moba, including new, larger maps with 1, 2 or 3 lanes, interesting map objectives, and movement-only mounts (e.g.: warclaw without skills and without evades) with a 3s casting time mount skill that is easily interrupted when attacked. Free players would get a basic mount. Small maps like Battle of Champion's Dusk would not get mounts, of course. 
---
* WvW seasons.
---
* Improved skirmish scoring.
---
* Encouraging spreading all over the map and player fights with methods like [these](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/962922#Comment_962922).
---
 * More meta-events across WvW, covering each supply route, rewarding for keeping entire supply routes defended. 
---
 * WvW bounties that players in parties, raid squads and squads can grab in bounty marker NPCs, and that pit parties of the same size against each other in certain objectives, like 5v5 in camps, 10v10 in towers, 20v20 in keeps, and 50v50 in stonemist. Making sure to discourage going in larger parties by making taking all bounties and spreading better than taking them one by one and going with a larger group than the bounty requires.
---
 * A fourth NPC faction that attacks and captures undefended objectives but teleports away if more than one player faction enters the objective. So players have to stay behind and defend, and players who come to attack are more likely to find players defending and fight them. 
---
 * Changing PvE-only events like the veteran creatures to have an actual scoring use and a reason for players to fight over them.
---
&gt; them not talking about other modes but story during LW announcements mean there will be no updates to them. 
---
That's BS and you know it
---
&gt; which ones 
---
S3E1
---
S4E1
---
S4E6
---
&gt; I should have been more precise, I'm talking about relevant, gaming comparisons. 
---
Everyone does it, and i mean everyone. It's for convenience sake. Not everyone is in the same time zone, it's easier to just have a timer
---
Yeah youre right i dont good thing they have you wonderful players that will gobble up anything they shit out, cant really blow up in their faces if everyone justs leaves for a better game
---
Neither he nor ANet seems to understand how important this announcement was.  
---
Since PoF there has been a huge dissatisfaction with the direction of the game. Stale rewards, a lack of replayability, quarterly updates that only bring back players for a week, fractal and raid quality dropping and updates being too slow, PvP and WvW being neglected.  
---
What this announcement was about was the future of the game. Players were watching it to see what was in store. If we would be getting any expansion like content. If ANet would address these many issues. And ultimately if it is even worth sticking around or coming back to the game.  
---
And ANet blew it.  
---
No expansion-like content announced.  
---
No acknowledgement on any of the issues.  
---
The direction of the game has not improved.    
---
They have learned nothing from over 2 years of feedback.
---
I mean, that's probably the only thing keeping me in the game.
---
Good point
---
I found something new during my 15th+ world completion ... No the last 2 ones (out of 19 atm) because I was mostly rushing through with mounts while watching movies, but I'm pretty sure that if I start a new world exploration now and actually look around, I'll find new things again, that I somehow missed all the other times.
---
Functionally, GW1 is still the same as it was all those years ago. Maybe even better after the few touch ups they've given it.  
---
WoW classic is literally just vanilla WoW without persisting death skeletons as far as I know.
---
You kept referring to her in the present tense so I was confused whether you knew or not.
---
Gw1 rollerbeetle races were more fun. 8 people racing down a hill with power ups and attacks. Not literally time trial races
---
Me too, come sort of consumable option like keys or hunting bonds as an alternative choice to skins would have been appreciated.
---
Yep.  That's about the size of it.
---
Fair points, and I wouldnt say I disagree, but there are a few nuances to your points that id like to address:
---
Firstly just like to mention that gw2 is the top “PVP” mmo next to WoW, and most other mmos are pay to win in terms of pvp.
---
Progression models in ff14 are much different than gw2. Many players return to games like ff14 not only for the content updates, but also because of the treadmills associated with that kind of progression model, in order to stay competitive in any kind of pve or pvp. 
---
Consider gw2 in direct comparison to an update in ff14.  There are rarely new stats added, zero gear progression, often no balance associated with the update, potentially a meta associated with a new piece of gear, or a collection, And the story. 
---
Lets have a hypothetical thought: 
---
new ff14 update- complete new story content/additional content, complete progression treadmill, gain competitive access to pve and pvp modes. 
---
new gw2 update- complete new story/raid/fractal/acheevos/collections/metas, log out. 
---
Because there is only horizontal progression, new updates don’t incentivize players to participate in any content they haven’t been doing in the first place. There is no reason to stay logged in to grind gear to do the new raid, or crush under levelled players in pvp.
---
All that was said was that it would be a living world announcement and it would be held in person at a specific venue. What does the fact that they rented a theater have to do with presenting "nothing extraordinary?" 
---
What would make people think anet will "only ship episodic contents" as you put it? 
---
The disappointment you mention seems to be based off of assumption. The moment someone starts to expect more than what is stated, then it is important to be open to the possibility of disappointment.
---
Instead we have an echo chamber of people whinging about their expectations not being met. While stupid isn't the word I would use, the general atmosphere of the subreddit makes it unpleasant and unproductive to take part in the community in my opinion. When the echo chamber just wants their negativity validated, it can be irritating when you have a dissenting opinion.
---
Because white knights love using the "oh you're not a veteran/haven't played enough to understand" excuse as a defense most likely.
---
It's ArenaNet that was turning this into a BIG deal with months of announcements of announcements of announcements.
---
If they'd just done a blog post there wouldn't have been all of these complaints. But it's rather ridiculous to create all this hype for basically nothing.
---
But customers are not also your friends or family we typically don't give 2 shits about company politics and running, we care about the game and content. No one wants excuses. Players cant play "Class,Heart,Resilience" no one was expecting anything amazing and then a company comes out and pretends they have something but it was nothing that's entirely on the company not players/customers.
---
What's wrong with people. Top right may not be the best looking shot but I love the one right under. You can also get dull and boring shots from older zones in the game..
---
I won't be surprised if the new one is vaguely reminiscent. All issues aside, GW2's art team is usually on point.
---
That has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. Ask someone else those questions.
---
" Season 5 will have expansion-like features. "
---
After the way they treated Eir in HoT, I have zero interest in them going anywhere near Eir again.
---
They responded with apologist fluff. Nothing would've been better.
---
"What if they announce in Oct..."
---
It's already been two years. Did we watch the same announcement? Nothing is the playerbase wanted is coming.
---
btw that PvP set is so ugly, they'd have to pay me gold to actually wear it. How on earth is it supposed to entice players?
---
This community is already the pinnacle of entitlement, a roadmap will only make that worse
---
Yeah dude it's really that bad. The context is important. I'm trying to be fairly objective here, so I'll try explain from both sides. 
---
Anet got BTFO by NCSoft. They got told "what you're doing is not working. Fucking fix it." And since there were also huge layoffs, I imagine "or else" might have been mentioned too.
---
So Anet takes several months to respond. And we get that, they're going through some shit. They're a caterpillar about to emerge as a butterfly. 
---
So what are we expecting? We're expecting the game's new direction. We're expecting Anet to say "this is what we are going to differently so that things don't get so fucked up again."
---
And what we get is "Hey! More of the same! New players come check this game out!"
---
So forget the overhype, forget the letdown, and let's just look at what they did for different people:
---
Veteran perspective: no hardcore content, no promised features except I guess maybe build templates?, and essentially no reason to expect the game to be any better for hardcores, WvWers, PvPers, than it has been. That part of the community has been told to shut up for get out. 
---
Casual perspective: More of the same, and cool little raids. But don't expect more frequent content or anything different really.
---
New player perspective: This game looks cool, maybe I'll get into it.
---
... So it seems like dedicated players got shafted and the announcement was really advertising for new players. Is that ok? We want a healthy game with new players, right? Can't be mad that the game will become popular....
---
..... Until those new players become veterans. Until they become us and get fed up too. Once they get past the awesome combat system and say "wait now what I committed to this game and now I feel let down"
---
So I'm hugely disappointed because this to me is a temporary measure. It's drawing in new investors like a pyramid scheme. Get more players and use their revenue to make more events to get more players, but meanwhile the longer people play the more they get fed up.
---
That's my take on it. And that's why I think it not only shafts the people it should have been made for, but it also doesn't really help the game in the longterm.
---
You might be right, but their policy is that everything they release has to be tailored for selling stuff in the cash shop. And sadly you make a lot more money with delivering bites of new stuff every few months, than with repeatable or end game content. (not even speaking of pvp/wvw)
---
So? They haven't learned anything it seems.
---
To prove that I have extensive knowledge of the game. Not a random casual with below 1k hours that comes and complain.
---
I liked the [big green choya](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/474437879?t=40m50s).
---
they released not a season ... they released a saga dude
---
I'm just curious how you know how profitable competitive modes would have been if ANet doesn't.
---
I prefer they deliver instead of telling stories.
---
Well, I do these actually, but often enough it's too easy to realize that it's just a way for them to artificially prolong the content.
---
They make more money from microtransactions than they'd ever make from a sub.
---
&gt; What were you expecting? 
---
Basically what we got.  The better question would be "What were you hoping for?" For me the answers would be the following,  in addition to what ANET announced. 
---
-  2-3 new fractals
---
-  A new raid wing (not a huge raid fan, but don't let community dwindle any further)
---
-  Some love for WvW
---
Sure. But what they did here requires lots of balls. "hey there, we are going on as the last two years! byebye." That requires lots of confidence.
---
Some players expected more than that.
---
&gt; That's BS and you know it
---
That's what we're debating and apparently you're in minority currently.
---
&gt; S3E1
---
&gt; S4E1
---
&gt; S4E6
---
3 examples out of how many? 20? and that's not even counting season 1, cause I'm too lazy checking
---
&gt; Everyone does it, and i mean everyone. It's for convenience sake. Not everyone is in the same time zone, it's easier to just have a timer
---
Thread removed: Begging is not allowed.
---
Imagine if GW2 had a cash shop where you paid 20$USD for a mount skin. They could probably finance alot of content that way couldn't they?
---
Will it be called ice-top? Or white-wastes? Seems they going back the the ls1 map release strategy of things will change over time
---
I felt like he was great though. One of the best shoutcasters I've ever seen.
---
this guy looks like a slimmer teapot ngl
---
Any idea when they are releasing?
---
What a stupid comment.
---
Make sure you buy that merch yo. Gotta fund your content somehow, Anet needs all the love and support
---
Nah man, the length in the back -- it's clearly planned to be trench coat-y.
---
I have no problem with casuals, god I hate that word, people enjoy games however they want   
---
exotic gear is actually enough, a good player in exotic will outdps an average player in ascended
---
I agree. I obviously don't think that it would be reasonable to expect Arenanet to refund payments to other retailers, but they already have a separate in-game compensation for those who purchased Heart of Thorns between July 1 and July 30. It surprised me too, how explicitly they excluded customers who purchased the expansion anywhere else.
---
I don't think you have to justify choosing a retailer over the official site by the way. There is generally nothing wrong with that and there is a list of official retail partners in different countries on the Guild Wars 2 website, here: [https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/#France-physical](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/#France-physical)
---
It feels odd to me that choosing a retailer is being penalized so harshly in this situation, but that they could have avoided the entire issue with more transparency and an earlier announcement bugs me much more.
---
It does sound like the exact thing that Jormag would have to whisper to Commander Gutslurper to have a chance at enlisting him.
---
Jormag is a 'sell-your-soul' kind of dragon. It probably knows all about temptation.
---
Choosing between Aurene and Jormag would be akin to choosing between empathy and sociopathy.
---
January 2020
---
&gt;If you have nothing to hype about the game don't do a massive announcement. It is plain and simple.
---
This right here. Even with the layoffs as everyone has mentioned above, we heard a number of times that they happened so the game would improve. Building up to a huge announcement like this is of course going to lead to players being excited about what's to come. That's the freaking intention after all but it's tough to deliver on. With a small as a presentation as this was it, would've been better of as a project announcement. Just my opinion here, but I can imagine there wouldn't be NEARLY as much backlash if we'd have gotten a flashier blog post about what's to come. Something bigger than a standard announcement like Ascended Food but not building a month in advance...
---
Do we really need *these* many threads about the same thing?
---
Retail wow appears to be better if OP only cares about raids. Classic is still fun af tho
---
it already is on spotify
---
I just worry, is all. They’ve screwed over the norn before; I wouldn’t be surprised if they went back to ignoring the norn like they usually do.
---
Also: while they have backed up on DE a little bit, they still mention Rytlock, Caithe, and Logan, a lot. Zojja and Eir have been ignored and misused. Part of that is due to VAs and those politics - but would it be impossible even to talk about Eir and “maybe she had research or strategies on Jormag” or at least “she would want us to do this right”?
---
well, they doesn't seems rly emotionally hit when they throw every week new cash grab shit lootbox.
---
Do not use the booster on your first character is going to be the majority response here. You'll miss out on a lot, including experience learning your skills and class. Just hold it for when you want to make another character.
---
Yeah, I write her in stories, so I tend to refer to her in present tense. &gt;.&gt;
---
It was special because there was fans there to make it special.
---
(´▽`ʃ♡ƪ)
---
If your perspective is "I want this game to be MY GAME above all others" you're always going to be disappointed.  Happens with every live service game, development will never keep up with dedicated players.  It's impossible. 
---
Even the simplest systems will run out of content eventually.  LoL tries to keep things fresh by continuously rebalancing existing champs and adding new ones, but the game is stagnating all the same.  Fortnite can only reskin a person with a gun in so many ways, and half the changes they try catch community backlash.  You'll reach a point in every Rogue-like where you know what's coming.
---
It's not a bad thing to draw a line and say "I've got enough from this piece of content" and leave it.  If you do that with all that GW2 has to offer, take a break. Come back when there's a new event, or think back on your fractals experience and want to push it a little further, or like the look of a set of meta-event weapons and want to complete it.  A lot of what I see today is plain old burn-out.
---
Alright fair enough, you are right. I missed it on the forums, I assumed it had just been posted.
---
I gotta say, that was one of anet biggest mistakes. It’s just sad that it isn’t going better, at least for now. GW2 still has a lot of potential and I’m not going to leave it in a near future anyway.
---
Get out of here with your non-bias constructive criticisms &amp; observations. /s
---
No dates, no exact information, balance changes are just slight nerfs instead of necessary reworks. This post is the most obvious kneejerk PR reaction I've ever seen.
---
Maybe you are referring to Gaile Gray? Community manager for 18 years at ANET? She was well know in GW2 and interacted pretty often with players in game. Don't know what happened with GW2 but it seems that it survives only on good faith from its players. It truly feels like a large amount of time and resources have been wasted since the beginning. With the amount of money they surely made, where's the content?
---
I don't think they screwed them over, they ignored norn race since release mostly. I, for once, am happy we're going against Jormag and against charr at the same time. They mixed 2 awesome plot subjects into one and I believe without connecting charr legions into dragon story, we would never go to BL homelands.
---
I love the meme!
---
That’s a good point too. It makes me so mad. They demoted her from a fierce hero into Braham’s mom, and if that was all they wanted to keep her as, I would want them to not mention her at all.
---
So much damn potential. So many ideas, and they wasted it all on Braham, who half the fans don’t even like.
---
I honestly expected them to steer the ship in a new direction.  
---
Seems like it's just full steam ahead into the abyss, though.  
---
Shame about WvW/pvp getting jack shit. Pvp in this game is really the only thing I do outside of the LW story content. All the good skins are in the gem store so gold is basically useless. Why spend hundreds of hours farming it when I can just buy the shit with much less of my IRL time?  
---
What an absolute mess...
---
Is there any way to nullify the effects of Aviator memory boxes? For the 2nd day in a row somebody dropped one of these onto one of the meta chests and yet again my screen turned sepia. It makes the game unplayable. I logged out yesterday after it happened. 10 minutes after I log in again today it hits me again. What with my boredom with the game, I simply logged off again. If this crap is going to continue, I'm done. I really don't understand why ANet would have something like this.
---
Of course I am enjoying the RP emulator already it's an amazing one :)
---
But they said I could play how I wanted! That means I can face roll as much as I like :p
---
high five on that flair though.   
---
I choked on a beer laughing.
---
Dumbledore being gay might not be explicitly stated in the books but it's pretty obviously he isn't completely straight if you read it critically at all. I agree with the rest of your comment though.
---
That's true, I agree with you.
---
I personally always skip them, unless the content I'm supposed to repeat for them is actually good/fun.
---
I did most of them in HoT, a lot of them in LS3, but with PoF and LS4 things stopped being engaging enough to repeat.
---
Now we just need a PoF logo tshirt to complete the set of 3. Maybe they will give it when they make PoF free with the next expansion! ..Oh.
---
No I am Corporate commander here POG.
---
Yeah, only one showed up because the rest are at home leveling in WoW Classic.  They are choosing a 15yr old static MMO over GW2 PvP.  Let that sink in.
---
Okay, you're saying nothing of substance. I never said anything about merch.
---
I believe the main problem is... they couldn't do this today because they literally had nothing to show. Haven't you noticed they used mostly concept arts and a trailer without gameplay footage?
---
This season will be rushed as fuck.
---
Well, they're not wrong.
---
I can agree with that, somewhat. But is that what the emphasis is going to be on? It’s one thing to balance them side by side, but we know Anet can get really hyper focused on one thing and totally ignore everything else. (We’ve seen how long they’ve held onto human-centric stories in LW.)
---
Also we just got rid of posts "which expansion to buy/first" :)
---
&gt; There’s nothing wrong with admitting things went wrong.
---
Both huge companies and huge governments ^is ^there ^even ^a ^difference? still consist of old people who do everything the old way. They often don't know that the world changed, especially in the IT-infused areas like entertainment, so behave like they used to years ago... except it rarely works as expected when information can be shared as easily and when there's just too much experience accumulated. So, obviously, they... double down, because if you don't succeed at first, try harder, right? :D
---
The problem is they set the deadlines much much earlier for the first time, when LS4 was just starting. But gaps grow larger and larger. 
---
It won’t work, if it will continue to go that way.
---
You know you have a point. We should start a thread for everyone to outline exactly **how** to communicate. Because they went from silent to giving previews on balance patches and trying to show people what they have coming up, but apparently even that is not enough. Instead of having them stab around in the dark to make people like you happy we should tell them exactly how we want them to not be silent any further but also not talking the wrong way too. Thanks for your reply!
---
LOL so it's okay for the entire subreddit to cry about raids but PvPers have to lighten the fuck up?
---
&gt; I mean it's just pax, to be fair.
---
PAX is Anet's preferred event for their biggest announcements.
---
If you also don't have Schizophrenia you might want to try LSD someday and try reading then. It might counteract the aphantasia for a bit.
---
Jora is more important in the northern shiverpeaks than Eir. We have Braham's whole character arc and the whole suns refuge thing with her.
---
I don't think we'll see anything from deceased destiny's edge for a while. All I'm hoping is either they kill off zojja or find a voice actress that sounds like Felicia Day; but we won't see zojja for a while either.
---
You should i mean they are adding all of those "expansion level content" i dont know how youll finish it all by yourself. Well im sure youll find a way since youve been doing so for the past 7 years
---
Sure. I think we're on the same page in terms of what you're saying. 
---
My point was that, since warframe has very similar underlying issues (monetization via casual playerbase), the community interaction and roadmaps are simply stopgaps, damage control. The problem itself remains. 
---
In my opinion, by managing it's fallout and pretending there is no problem to begin with (similar to what GW2 is doing by addressing these with potential solutions to a much lesser extent) they're making a huge gamble in the hopes that they get to the kind of content in time before the community catches onto the problem. GW2 failed that gamble a while ago. Warframe is in the process, however they can recover. 
---
I'm saying that maybe,  ANet should just stop addressing issues they very clearly can't handle, just like they did with dungeons and legendaries. Whether it was good or bad, both of those examples were going to happen, so they just told the community how it is. 
---
I'm not saying to release things unfinished, I'm saying to tell us it's unfinished and that it's shelved for the foreseeable future. After all, we did end up getting our legendaries.
---
I prefer 3 good maps over 6 average ones. So in a way, better content. Also, I assume, because there won't be so much pressure around delivering a map every episode, we will have that effort put elsewhere, like the story instances getting longer, or more rewards in the map.
---
Idk everyone I talked to in game was super bummed about the whole thing. I'm glad your guild is happy though
---
and the guy was ugly.
---
I focused on Medina's tweets because those were actually posted in the context of this current situation and not in the aftermath of a far worse screw-up by a completely different company.
---
And within those tweets he always sticks to "developers" and "the team" when begging for sympathy. Not "the company", "the team" - his own former colleagues. Note I'm not actually disagreeing with anything you say in your reply here but your OP does seem to interpret more into Medina's words than I can see in the tweets themselves.
---
Just as we united with multiple Elonian factions going against Kralk, in this season I assume we will see Flame Legion joining Icebrood while we have to convince and unite (Khan Ur vibes much) other Legions to fight new threat.
---
I mean, god damn it, isn't this great? Seeing two most aggressive races of Tyria being a focus of the story?
---
GW2 is GoT
---
Rytlock is Azor Ahai. 
---
&amp; Icebrood are  The Whitewalkers
---
Which will have a better ending?
---
Notice that it was said that GW2 is about "dragons" and not "killing dragons". PoF didn't let us kill any dragons, but you can't possibly say it wasn't about dragons, or did Vlast, Aurene, Glint and Kralk not play a big role in the expansion?
---
That’s understandable, but gw2 isn’t even near to death right now. But it will, if they won’t change anything in how they do things and how communicate. I just don’t want gw2 to go like wildstar went. 
---
I love gw2 too much to let it go just like that.
---
I'm sorry, I don't see how anyone prior to 2007 could have deduced that Dumbledore was gay. I've read the series cover to cover a dozen times, and individual books as many as 38 times. I was a hardcore fan back then, and that news felt like it came right out of nowhere.
---
I agree with WP's theory, I think it might put on a more masculine voice to lure the Svanir in maybe.
---
I think they're talking to us though not Aurene, we're the champion of Aurene after all.
---
Even something with no direct gameplay impact like a brand new player race would've excited a lot of people.
---
Yeah an NCSoft rep came out and gave it to us. Not ANet themselves
---
Yet you responded anyway. How cute.
---
Let's not act dumb. Yeah they may never release, but the reason people still gladly buy in their stuff is because they are 100% with what they are doing, why and how. I fail to see why we can't agree that having a well detailed and updated roadmap is a good thing for any project.
---
They absolutely did.
---
 Hello,
---
I've recently achieved level 22, been enjoying the game for the most part, what's been bothering me though are the lack of mounts and the boring walk to one waypoint to another, please, I need to know how I can get a mount without buying the expansion packs, I want to experiment everything a free account can before making my purchase.
---
Needless to say the lack of mounts have been really killing my likeness towards the game, fast, and knowing myself I'll probably not play it for a week more until I finally just drop it, out of boredom, which is a shame because I feel the game has much to offer.
---
So please, can someone ansewer some of these questions?
---
I play a Warrior and an Elementalist, of course, I have no idea how the leveling system works nor what I should be doing, so yeah, any help would be appreciated.
---
Cheers!
---
(Off Topic - I tried posting a topic twice, but some stupid bot just outright deleted my question, I think it is primitive to not allow people to post their comments in the form of new threads, just a suggestion.)
---
\&gt; But Tyria is a unique and beautiful world, and it’s been a place I’ve called home for the past 14 years. Regardless of what happens, I will continue to treasure this game, and I hope that after some consideration, the rest of you will too.
---
Read the whole thing and this sums it up quite well. 
---
We are basically in the same boat. I think I started in 2007 but that does not matter for my point.  I'm just hoping for content that makes up group up together, make new friends and not group up in a blob and run through a story for the two hours. I really need some content that I can set my teeth into :)
---
Imagine the subreddit if he made this same comment about raids...
---
Nor was Guild Wars 1 about all that. It's called Guild Wars because of the Guild Wars over the bloodstones, which lead to the eventual near destruction of the human race before the events of GW1
---
I disagree. Both expansions have added more than just more story e.g. gliding, mounts, elite specs. If this release was going to include this type of expansion like content they'd be foolish to not have announced it today don't you think? 
---
The only thing I heard that might be interesting would be the strike missions which sound like raids-lite. They overpromised and underdelivered imo.
---
Mhm, actually, not much lately...
---
I mean, I want to continue loving it because of all those good memories, but reasons keep piling up that impede me from doing it; in example, my guild went on hiatus thanks to server linking, my server dispersed for the same reason and the worst is that the change didn't even help with the problem in the long term, today's WvW population is on it's lowest...
---
Not to mention all the times they have failed to deliver.
---
That’s not replayable content. I’m done with all the ap and story in one day max. It’s supposed to be a mmo not a single player rpg.
---
This I feel like the presentation was premature. We should have gotten the same timeline with the prologue coming and then having this before episode 1 so more things could have been finalized. Also the final plug being for marketing products kinda stung.
---
&gt; Would you prefer another rushed half-assed expac like HoT was? 
---
Yes. I'd prefer anything to living story.
---
&gt; You only have to look at ArenaNet's past history when dealing with fans who are disappointed, critical or even just trying to engage with the developers on a meaningful level. 
---
I was one of those players, I don't need to luck back. I have always felt unwelcome and like a disturbance to the peace, except for when dealing with Fractal and Raid Ben.
---
Oh boy, can't wait to two-click and change builds while waiting for actual new content.
---
I’m glad this is being brought up, the should’ve at least teased an expansion or at least “more to come” kind of content, not something we are going to get within the next few weeks.
---
Of course they will fail in delivering anything related to WvW, because apparently someone said WvW community complained a lot.. idk who or why.
---
Why should I give a fuck about treating a studio that sees me as an ATM, to farm with loot boxes, with kid gloves?  
---
Why should I give them an inch when they CHOSE to divert resources to a doomed secret side project?  
---
Why are game companies allowed to get away with shit that no other industry is given slack with?
---
Why?
---
Set post processing lower. [Cameras use sepia tone filters if the post-processing option is on high.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aviator%27s_Memory_Box)
---
Mike Z was *really* nervous today. Either simply because of being on stage or being afraid of reactions. Didn't Greg specifcly look at the direction where Mike went off, reasuring him that the fans like what he said?
---
Many who use the earlier logic didn't turn around during that boss battle, and thus didn't see Kralk at all. It's no wonder they are in the dark
---
I just wonder why the theatre?  I really feel if they had published this as a blog it would have gone over well.  Makes me think it was maybe reserved a long time ago and they had to use the space.  Pure conjecture, but theatre space is not cheap especially in downtown Seattle the weekend of PAX so this just seems like a money losing event for them.  Had they actually announced something worthwhile the cost could have been made up.  Either way it just seems odd to me.  This announcement paired with slow specialization releases would have satisfied me, but this just made me question the game if they view this as a good use of money.
---
I think it’s exciting, for sure. I just don’t trust Anet to give an equal respect to the norn.
---
I literally felt bad for him. He knew people won't like it. MO didn't have balls to show up, like he did during previous live announcements.
---
There's positive players in-game excited about the new Saga and strongly dislikes toxic players, so i am in same boat as them we can survive on our own duhh. :D no toxic gamers happy gamers in-game wooo we achieved the goal.
---
&gt;wouldn't lead to any development changes for GW2
---
I think we can all agree that it has had 0 impact on their development philosophy  
---
I mean, we are basically just getting more of the same LW cadence while pvp/wvw rots.   
---
Status quo!
---
Congrats! Glad you didn't have to wait too long.
---
&gt;  Most likely because they monetize better.
---
And this is really important. But it seems that Anet has done nothing to improve things in that direction in years. WF focuses more on wider approach and pushes fair regional prices, pesonal discounts are really frequent (20%, 50%, 75% off for platinum and you will buy it when discount pops-up, guaranteed), tonnes of small non-cosmetic progression stuff you can spend plat without really complaining about monetization.  In GW2 I open market, see some random cosmetics for 2000 gems or their "limited offer" with 15-10-0% discounts on gem purchases on site (in USD only) and it just never looks like a good deal.   
---
One other thing is that Anet never bothered with game translations. After 7 years you still can't type Cyrillic in chat (or most Unicode). Many would argue that it's a good thing, "we don't need that moon-speak in Tyria", but it really shows how Anet treats their gamers and why many of them left without ever looking back.
---
I'm merely want Anet to do something meaningful with GW1 again, not necessarily suggesting to re-release it.
---
"I think the warclaw was a pretty good call - you could do something similar. I don't play WvW so I'm probably not the best person to give an example."
---
Stopped reading
---
I think it was both.
---
I accidentally looked it up... Why does he do this to us.
---
I’m expecting an announcement worthy of the buildup. How is that entitled?
---
I don’t think it’s gone for everyone, obviously. But it is sad that they hyped this announcement that much. They should’ve just do it like every other episode of LW. Nothing of this would happen.
---
But again, I’m totally against policy that says no expacs is good. It’s BS if they actually think like that.
---
BUT I like the direction they went with a trailer and there might be some good things hidden there. Maybe they’ll come around or hire right people. My heart hurts when I see so many amazing artists working so much, but the management fails again and again and again.
---
on one hand, wtf this is just sad.
---
on the other hand, at least I'm not disappointed about me never being able to get one. So yay, I guess.
---
Poor decision making is still poor decision making whether there is a sob story behind it or not.
---
Too bad all of the competent ones are leaving
---
Then I encourage you to give a constructive opinion on it
---
I did
---
I didn't say I couldn't respond :)
---
The guy said ''In 15 minutes'' so it should work already, no?
---
It's always those who has never played WvW who claim that Warclaw was ever a good thing for WvW.
---
&gt; So here is my suggestion to you, If each player who can afford paying at least $10 a month or more to get gems and buying whatever they want from GEM Store, please do so let's give ArenaNet the revenue they deserve and hoping they improve in delivering the content that some of us been waiting for. 
---
....lol "we're making money, that means they like it, do more of this"
---
I'm an original player from back in the day. I came back for HoT, but WvWvW was dead. I came back for the desert expansion. PvE was fun, but couldn't really get into raiding because it was everything that made leave world of warcraft for GW2. Also, WvWvW was still dead. I was surprised to see a GW2 thread pop up on r/popular, and came back to take a peek. I imagine the game is still in a similar state of unfun.
---
E
---
They even retconned the goddamn calendar.
---
It's called Guild Wars because GvG was the endgame of Prophecies and Anet successfully built a scene around it, even threw tournaments. The lore around it was just that, lore.
---
They are also called **Arena**Net for a reason.
---
 Not that big. Be better b bc in bc cab
---
I don't feel like they care about me, to be honest. 
---
As a cis white straight man who likes to raid and be competetive, I'm far from their target audience. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about who I am now or feeling left out based on who I am, I just feel left out based on what I like and want from the game.
---
Hopefully nobody twists this into anti-lgbtq+ now. :/
---
Here we see another dumb white knight defending ANet like they were family.
---
I mean I'm excited for the new season, don't get me wrong, honestly it's the most excited I've ever been for a non-expansion update. But you have this big presentation for an announcement for something we already knew was happening, the next living world season. All this buildup and a live event for something that just feels hollow. It's nice that we have some details now but there was very little actual substance to the presentation. For the amount of solid information we got it should have instead been a blogpost or pre-scripted trailer.
---
Balancing is good, but will never shake things up as much as elite specs and doesnt generate the interest new specs do. Balancing is about refinement, not shaking things up.
---
They could have done the same thing Bethesda did with the Elder Scrolls VI. Just give a tiny ass teaser, no release date, nothing. The community would be very happy.
---
Your right. I can also put up all my achievements, Li's, PvP &amp; WvW levels to show how hardcore and how serious I am to the game. But this is not the point here, hours is just a basic guideline to show how long I was here for. I hope my suggestions can be considered from both hardcore &amp; casual player perspective.
---
&gt;  
---
I mean...If you were actually reading what he said you would have understood he talks about the collection for the beetle, not the beetle itself.
---
Prediction.  I assume it'll be Prologue, halloween, nothing, wintersday, ep 1, lunar new year, sab, ep 2, dragonbash, festival, ep 3, wash rinse, repeat.
---
One of the best things that WoW ever did for content was the piecemeal out story content each week. Sure, it creates time gates, but it keeps people interested, coming back, and allows for more development time over the lifetime of an expansion.
---
Key phrase: each week
---
This post articulates well why I haven’t felt the need to login to GW2 in a few months, and instead have been playing on an EQ emulator.
---
What’s funny is yesterday I thought about logging in and patching so I didn’t get dropped from my guilds, especially since my favorite GW2 time is coming up (Mad King). 
---
I didn’t, but now my Reddit feed is blowing up with all kinds of chatter about it. I still have yet to actually see what was announced, but it’s clear that the reaction has not been what anet anticipated.
---
They can't give you what you want because they don't have it.
---
GW2 redditors, the whinniest of them all..
---
Bitch if they don't advertise the game.  
---
Bitch when they do.  
---
Bitch they never hype anything at all.  
---
Bitch when they do.
---
I would say the exact same.
---
reddit is trash tier and always has been; though i'm not sure if you are referring to gw2 community or this subreddit's
---
*shrugs*  I'm sorry I like content you don't.  Perhaps you'd prefer a different game?
---
Kill it, burn it with fire.
---
There's actually a lot of Classic players who never even played Vanilla tho
---
You missed out playing an amazing game.
---
Oh good. They're nerfing Mesmer's usefulness in WvW again; it was getting too powerful. I was worried I would get interested in WvW again.
---
not the OG ost
---
You’ll get a lot of feelings of well... what do I do now? How do I play the game? What do I do for progression? Etc. using a boost especially since  you are new is absolutely stupid. This game does NOT have an endgame like FFXIV or WoW, there is a gear cap. This game at endgame is about what you want to do and less about grinding raids week in and out for slightly better gear. 
---
You can raid or do fractals (hard dungeons) all you want but you will hit an end point. Just play the game from the start, it’s easier to leArn skills, combos, and weapons that way.
---
I'm seeing way too many of some certain talking points, so I feel like I should maybe clarify some things.
---
Obviously, you are allowed to be disappointed in this presentation. You're allowed to dislike the presentation. Hell, you're even allowed to hate it and be angry at ANet.
---
However, just because you don't like the Living World stuff that was showcased DOESN'T MEAN IT IS NOT CONTENT.
---
Did the presentation focus too much on shitty merch? Hell yeah. Is the neglect for PvP, WvW, and raids disheartening? Hell yeah. Is it okay to say that Living World is not content?
---
Hell no. Because it's a straight up lie. You can form arguments and rail against Living World, but you can't lie and say it's not content. Because it IS content, you just don't like it.
---
Yup. Pretty much nothing is interruptable in FFXIV 99% of the time and generally you need to stun to interrupt on fights where it's possible
---
So, hail satan?!?
---
&gt; im gonna call you a dumbass when you act like one.
---
Well said dumbass,
---
Yeah, personally it's the update I've been wanting for 7 years now. My issue isn't with the content, just how it was presented.
---
ANET is in balance control and I am not complaining whatsoever. A lot of these things are 
---
I just wish they talked about some of thee things during the live event. Especially the Competitive plans.
---
50s and a yellow unid
---
You're wasting your time with this shill drone dude.
---
I do get it, Matthew, but just try - if you can - to take a step back and really ask if you're able to see things from the customer's point of view, instead of having a volatile emotional reaction as a former employee who *feels like* their friends or former co-workers are being personally attacked when ***that isn't what's happening here***.
---
Just try, if you can, Matthew, to understand that ArenaNet has had no communication policy with it's customers for a long time now. They never tell us what they're struggling with or working on, and everything is a secret. They don't tell us the current state of affairs of the development team or how their development team is split up. They don't tell us even basic information about what team is working on what. They intentionally obfuscate everything they can, and they *never communicate a single fucking thing*. Just try, if you can, to take a step back and realise that a company cannot behave this way, deliver subpar content for over two years, and then hype up a theatre stream for a couple of weeks beforehand (including an entire 24 hour broadcast countdown) only to then reveal literally nothing.
---
Just try, if you can, to take a step back and really ask if people are attack your former friends and co-workers, or if people are disappointed ***at a company, not at the individuals***, for it's poor performance, it's refusal to ever communicate with us, it's refusal to ever acknowledge or address current issues and it's increasingly rampant and increasingly concerning habit of not really creating engaging content any more (where content instead hinges on timegates and other padding just to try and keep people logging in every day.)
---
Boy, gee, doesn't it sound *patronising*, Matthew?
---
it backfires if there is not enough to show
---
It would also be a real nice way for them to show a bit more of the mental stress the Commander has had over the years. Just have us go through a breakdown where we start lashing out at people and calling them out for things they've done over the years.
---
Time will tell tbh  
---
I'm also talking on a years long timeline here. It's just a matter of whether Person X wants to spend those getting broken into a new company that going places or trying right a ship that has a captain that drunk at the helm.
---
They gave it to us alright....
---
It looked to me very much like a gameplay trailer someone ran through an artsy filter, given the way the icebrood texture flip-flopped during the walk forward. Not a bad compromise and it still looks very good. I agree though that the HoT Rytlock combat trailer was more action packed.
---
I was told ascended gear or gtfu as well as study proper rotations for your class. That was the one thing I loved about raiding in wow back in early cata I didn't need a proper rotation with my arcane mage. It is also the reason why I got more into gw2 than wow. For the majority of the game you can play with whatever build you make. That all changes when you raid you need to follow all the cookie cutter builds that others found and follow proper rotations to maximize dps and what not. I remember in hots my healing guardian build (meant for og ac dungeon runs) could solo some map small group bosses. Super hard to kill but also meant DPS lacks as well. Sorry went off on a bit of a rant. I am not opposed to learning mechanics and proper rotations but everyone has told me I needed a full set of ascended gear before I would be considered for raiding. I tried farming fractals but lost interest.
---
PR bullshit, just like when they made a gigantic deal out of naming their patches Living Story when they're nothing more and nothing less than normal content patches just like every other MMO does.
---
Transparency.
---
BE. HONEST. WITH. US.
---
Stream what is going on in the dev build. Tell us what the plans are, what couldn't be done, and if it was scrapped or replace. Silence when ready or done is awful.
---
Original meme;  [https://www.elpopular.pe/sites/default/files/styles/img\_960x540/public/imagen/2017/06/14/Noticia-182753-tom-cruise-ve-sus-memes.jpg?itok=Qt9WwUSv](https://www.elpopular.pe/sites/default/files/styles/img_960x540/public/imagen/2017/06/14/Noticia-182753-tom-cruise-ve-sus-memes.jpg?itok=Qt9WwUSv)
---
And they maintained that with season 4 (PvE anyways), as that is what this interview is about.
---
Well, I've realized now that putting it into the post wasn't a good call, so I edited it
---
I agree it's very strange that choosing another retailer feels penalizing, when it shouldn't really matter. They still get their money, and now that it's suddenly free, they're able to keep it in this specific instance, while others are getting theirs back.
---
Of course as anybody will point out, they aren't obligated to offer refunds in the first place, and it's very kind of them to do so, but it always sucks when you're in the same boat as everyone else, but you aren't getting the same courtesy extended to you.
---
As for the justification, I know it's not one I *need* to make in this case, but it frustrates me nonetheless that their lack of clarity in their design is what drove me away from purchasing from the official site in the first place. I was there and ready to do it, but uncertainty steered me to another retailer. :/
---
That's just sad lol
---
This was a expansion announcement! The event today was about the next living world season (that was known for weeks!)
---
You can't compare this
---
this is why GGG and DE are so well received, they feel like people, people you can interact with, that WANT to interact with the community.
---
I agree on this. The Shaman's threads about leaks, and leaks in general, are exciting.
---
Literally called it a "Special announcement" and sent emails out about it but sure, keep playing dumb.
---
Can confirm.  :3
---
Mounts are only available if you own PoF expansion.
---
Regarding speed, you can always equip skills that grant swiftness as well as mobility skill like blinks, leaps and similar, to move faster. You can check the list of skills and traits that provide those on gw2 wiki.
---
The best way to level is by exploring and doing dynamic events (orange markers on the map). Hearts mostly serve as a guide to discovering more events, but completing hearts can be very tedious sometimes so you dont need to do all of them (unless you like to).
---
those *balance changes* are so out of touch,that i wonder how the fck you even come up with this shit.
---
Hey, maybe im wrong. 
---
Just seems more like a quick way to make a buck and show the higher ups “hey look we’re still profitable” to fit a deadline without actually making the hard choice to give players a reason to stay logged in. 
---
A player who is logged in is more likely to buy gems than one who isn’t. 
---
Having a competitive mode creates more novel experiences. Novel experiences make people come back (literally every popular game on the front page of steam)  there are people who have spent money on gun skins in cs:go who ONLY play dust. Those people don’t need a new map, they just crave novel experiences. Competitive game modes are inherently novel.
---
I made a similar post, except in greater detail, and I wholeheartedly agree with you!
---
I'm excited for the expansions being rolled together. None of the mechanics introduced in HoT were included in PoF, because the expansions were exclusive purchases.  If that trend continued, whatever expansion comes next would have ZERO PoF content; no mounts, no races, and any explorable content trivialized by mounts because it would be made to be done on foot.
---
This is a post that deserves getting deleted, compared to other posts that mods love to delete without a fucking reason...
---
No. Anet has no idea what normal humans think.
---
I had hope, but their devs feel out of touch with us (being super cringey to the point watching it hurts), not having any idea at all and basically being giant NPC's (try asking a question on their stream and use a frog emoji, you'll get instantly timed out by their own devs who moderate the chat. Hell I once typed pepothink and got it on a serious question and the reason why they do it is because they believe it's a sign that neonazis use.)
---
While I still believe they got normal devs, they must be in the vast minority and at this point I think anet prefers to hire the person who ticks off the most PC checkbars instead of the better dev :/.
---
Don't judge.
---
I am SO glad I'm not the only one who thinks of this!!!!! ♥
---
lmao same
---
Sons of Svanir.
---
The balance notes were posted a week ago according to the post date (not visible until today), and are seemingly a WvW specific sub-set of overall balance notes.
---
Its popular because its good... I never played vanilla so its definitly not nostalgia with me
---
The money they spent on that announcement alone would have paid for an intern to work on actual game content.
---
Despite everything wrong with the announcement I am actually very excited for the new story.
---
Finally Norn and Charr will get the focus. The footage they showed looked really good and that trailer actually got me hyped (only to be let down by the rest)
---
I'll hop on WoW in a heartbeat if they remove that insanely high subscription fee.
---
I'm too busy to reliably play every day, or even every other day. I hop on once a week, then not again for three weeks, then 12 days in a row.
---
glow effects have nothing to do with it. The design is shit and the quality is nowhere to be found. 
---
The ornaments on the shoulderpads are fucking painted on. The entire thing is just a flat surface lmao. This level of relying on textures for detalization is straight outta 2004. No amount of normals is gonna make that silhouette not look smooth as a peach
---
As in leave the servers going but no more patches, updates, new stuff of any kind? I'd be disappointed. The game isn't perfect but it's fun and I enjoy the story. I like running around maps, trying new stuff, playing fashion wars, getting achievements. It wouldn't be the end of the world, but it would be sad.
---
I mean good for them, to take some break and relax then come back playing Gw2, that happens to mmos in usual case scenario
---
Exactly. What is a saga going to entail, in their eyes? What is going to set it apart from a season or an expansion? Is this just a rebranding of the name, or is it actually something different?
---
of course.
---
After 5 years...get over it. They need to bring people on one spot if they ever want to sell another expansion. So PoF will now get you up to recent, ready for the expansion after LS 5.
---
I can't do anything to stop them.
---
I have other games i can play.
---
Yes give them more money to fix everything :O !
---
Is that when the last book came about? That's what i was referring to about it being obvious.
---
Fair completely, but expectations aren't the same as hope
---
I can't blame you for hoping, IK i am, but im not gonna act like they promised shit they ddint
---
They paid money to the Moore theater to kill the game.
---
With them cutting it short and the lack of announcements, I wonder if they planned to reveal something else, but it wasn't ready in time.
---
If that's the case, it was a mistake.
---
Definitely - which is why I strongly believe that WvW needs updates and fixes *before* actually new specs arrive.
---
Doesn't matter if new specs arrive and the mode still has the same or new flaws. I believe firmly that, as much as new specs would be *good*, it's far from being what is necessary
---
do i have to point out the quotes?
---
Only high IQ understands Toxic logic, you must been in the lower end.
---
People hate on the game because they love it. Give Anet a chance to show them what they are capable of. perhaps these new LS  episodes will be a rebirth of the game.
---
Couldn't care less about non-gameplay trailers. I'm sure it helps sell the game but I personally don't see anything of interest in them.
---
It would just be more disappointment on top of the current disappointment
---
Pretty sure every MMO I've ever played the developers always say that they're going to have faster/more-regular updates   which never lasts more than 1 or 2 patch cycles before they wind up back on the same cadence as before.
---
I don't even pay attention to those promises anymore
---
He felt sick to me. 
---
Also there is no way he wouldn't be aware that shit would hit the fan.
---
The layoffs hasn't only effected the people working there, the community is hurt too.
---
That doesn't mean it wasn't interesting to experience first hand. I also don't agree with the "inexplicable" outposts when most players don't read quests etc they just mindlessly run and kill. So does it really matter when you find a random one? If they seem inexplicable maybe next time NPCs should be added that make it clear "what happened". I think people bitch about LA being redone because of aesthetics not functionality. I liked the old one better but now we have scrolls that teleport us to venues with better functionality.
---
The first bounce should have been actually working on something.
---
&gt;If they'd just done a blog post there wouldn't have been all of these complaints. But it's rather ridiculous to create all this hype for basically nothing.
---
Then clearly you have never read the forums or this subreddit before.  Because if they had just done a blog post there would not have been these specific complaints but rather a completely different but equally toxic set of them.  GW2 players just love to pat themselves on the back about how great the community is... and in game to new players it can be... but then a very vocal portion of the community loves to scream and yell and tell everyone how the game is dead, that the devs need fired, and "fuck you ANet" for every perceived slight or every single thing that isn't done in exactly the way that they were hoping at exactly the time they were hoping for it.... even when the announcements are for things that a different vocal portion of the community were screaming for just a month ago or less.  So no... this isn't a great community.  Plenty of it is toxic, hateful, spiteful and impossible to please no matter what happens.  They didn't do this to themselves.  This is 100% on the players.
---
If you think people are coming back after the just showed off ez mode raids and pvp armor skins for the forseeable future. I got bad news for you bud
---
Possibly to postulate that the game is not dead and is still delivering content? Would make sense especially if they are aiming towards new players.
---
if we had to wait 2-3 months for a release and it doesn't even have a map or any content outside of the story, I think that would be a pretty steep step down in quantity in comparison. But I get what you are saying, that the more fluid nature of season 5 might be a good thing. I do still have concerns that we are looking at a higher quality season 2 style, which I would be disappointed in.
---
I have had multiple arguments today with people on this sub over whether or not Living World and achievements are content. If you want, look through my post history. Some of my posts were downvoted too, meaning that there are people who believe LW isn't content, but they aren't explicitly stating it.
---
I was.
---
I did.
---
But apparently you didn't read what I wrote. I said the audience in the theater. Not the redditors.
---
You think they will release new specs any time soon? :O
---
Hope your right.
---
Tweaking a spec to use a weapon that is already a part of the Holo forge shoudnt be that much of a problem.
---
(Holo was released with sword and shield in mind, Scrapper with hammer)
---
It's a teaser trailer that shows NOTHING of actual in-game substance. 
---
Looks gorgeous, but it does nothing.
---
Heh, you should have seen the Borderlands 3 "announcement". CEO actually performing card tricks, and the dev team not able to play the announcement trailer for over 30 seconds on Windows Media Player.
---
Now THAT was a bad presentation. I actually liked what I saw today, apart from wishing there'd been stuff for WvW etc.
---
I'm not an current player but I played from beta to probably a year ago pretty consistently.  While I understand his reaction from a developer point of view.  The people there are still working their asses off and deserve support.  However, I don't think there is any doubt this is a game in decline.  It could be a slow decline with a couple of blips of stability or short term growth even, but a new tier of food isn't going to bring the tens of thousands of people that have left back.  I don't see what in this update is supposed to appeal to me to bring me back.  It doesn't address some of the core issues in the different game modes one bit.
---
not the one who jumped on the hate bandwagon without giving it a second thought
---
nice npc energy
---
I didn't see anything that interested me. I might enjoy the next season, but I see no reason for them to just not roll it out quietly like any other story chapter. There was nothing "exciting" here.
---
I enjoy doing the collections?
---
He mentions fractals and repeatable metas as well tho. He didn't say raiders keep the game alive.
---
No u double.
---
Do i have to point out your white knighting?
---
Braided crotch tassels for all!!!
---
Cool. Not what I'm saying. PvP is content. WvW is content. Raids are content. Open world is content. Living World is content. ALL OF IT IS CONTENT.
---
Know that feeling back in school when you had to prepare a presentation and knew beforehand it wasn't very good?
---
&gt;World restructuring, commonly referred to as the Alliance system, remains our top priority for WvW. We’re not going into details on this post, since a lot of detail has been released previously. We are still not in a place where we feel comfortable releasing a target date, but we are still working on it.
---
I laughed out loud.
---
Imagine demanding a roadmap for free content on a game that doesn’t ask you to pay a subscription. Lmao
---
&gt;If you have layoffs, you think of a new strategy on how to develop content to please huge parts of the playerbase. 
---
What is so fucking stupid is their strategy is ignoring all repeatable content in the game. I got a huge gametime estimate playing REPEATABLE MODES like spvp, wvwvw, fotm and raids. And none of that is included in the announcement? But they're going to blow months on stupid cinematics I watch once?
---
True, I would love to support them, but I only do it with expansions (and base game awhile ago). 
---
If that would mean i would get as much content as PoF or at least somehow close, I’d be very happy.
---
sure you could have
---
i could have also cared about what an npc said, but since hes proud of being one i wont
---
because its all you are
---
got mine, sighed when i had to type the item name to destroy the skin lol
---
Yeah JK announced it shortly after DH came out. I had to endure 6 months of editorrial commentary on the topic in speech and debate the following year. It was a surprise to everyone.
---
thanks, I will take your upvote and I will give you my own
---
You know what's really sad, the fact that in the official forums posts criticizing the game and the event are being removed and the users getting banned for false reasons while the developers cherry pick only the positive threads to reply to.
---
Not the one who jumped on the white knight bandwagon without giving a second thought.
---
Nice drone energy.
---
&gt; iterally 50% of streamers have it,
---
So in previous post it was "everyone, and I mean everyone" and now it's only 50%?
---
You have no arguments mate. Thanks for playing.
---
Uhhh, that sounds like GW1, not GW2. I mean, GW2 is more solo friendly than any other MMO I know of, but most players leave and new people don't join much, what's going to happen to the economy? The game has no 2 player trade system and relies almost exclusively on the Trading Post to buy or sell most of anything, and a ton of money comes from selling things on the TP.
---
PvP Armor skin looks neat yo, Ez MODE RAIDS for casuals like you well that what I would assume.
---
why not? 45 minute announcement to discuss the new SEASON. not just an episode, not just to show concept art, not just to show one strike boss, not just to barely mention PvP and WvW, the whole SEASON.  the season they said is going to have expansion level content. do you think they showed anything that would be permissible in a new expansion preview? we got a cinematic trailer(the best part of the whole thing) an in game CONCERT clip, a little footage of a strike, a 10 second tease with no explanation of one of the new masteries, and then pretty much guild chat. with them releasing 500 cooking Tuesday, they kinda hyped this up to be bigger than that. but at this point 500 cooking overshadows it.
---
&gt;I know Anet hate roadmaps
---
and
---
&gt;I was shocked when it ended, and there wasn't a roadmap.
---
Very well written. Totally feel the same way about all and still have some hope left that they will listen to us
---
How many of them left, exactly? Two? This whole "I'm-leaving" drama looks like cheap attention whoring to be honest. Many games had those in the past (we had one important snowflake too in EVE [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1qevsh/streamer_mad_ani_petitions_on_eveo_forums_for_job/)). WF has still many great creators and they are not going anywhere.
---
THANK YOU.  "somehow linked with the devs as individuals" is horse shit to anyone who has actually read some of the toxicity here.  No... absolutely not.  Devs are being attacked not just the upper management.  Anyone who thinks otherwise has their head up their ass and isn't paying any attention to the world outside their tiny bubble.
---
Anet has listened to the reddit fanbase for too long. And it blew up in their faces when they had a raid event they didn't support demolish their normal streaming numbers.
---
They did this with the stupid new wvwvw map that favored defenders to the point fights didn't happen. That was the first time I quit, and when I came back I got into raids. AND THEY DID THE EXACT SAME THING.
---
They listened to people who asked for build templates when any decent player already has them in an add on!
---
So you mean we can't have your stuff anymore?
---
i agree with the last part of your sentence but NOT the first.  I wasnt underwhelmed  IT was fabulous.  They did what they said they were going to ...
---
My eyes
---
I don't think it's lore/exploration most people are asking for when they say easy mode raids, but rather just any amount of difficulty progression. Like FFXIV raids have normal &lt; hard &lt; extreme &lt; savage tiers, where the mechanics and DPS checks progressively become more complex and less forgiving the higher up you go. Yeah, there's vertical progression in FFXIV, but this can be mimicked without vertical progression. GW2 just has normal, and CM for some fights, which gives one-time rewards rather than encouraging players to progress to CM skill level to repeat it.
---
You completely missed my point. If everyone cannot have the opportunity to experience it firsthand, then it is shit design.
---
So if Deutsche Bahn fires half their staff and STILL manages to be only one hour too late on half of their trains I should be... Grateful? I was not the one firing the staff so I don't get care. Give me trains on time and the content we deserve. If you can't then employ more. Poor million dollar companies just want to juice max profit and people react so meany, how very mean
---
I'm busy preparing for the hurricane but wanted to chime in on this because this was about to be removed for the 3rd time from getting 5 reports and I have now set reports to ignore as this is a completely valid complaint and honestly is something ArenaNet needs to do. 
---
For those of you who might only play Guild Wars 2 I want to talk about another MMO I play for a bit here. Star Trek Online is 3 years older than Guild Wars 2. It has a much smaller dev team and the developer itself has FOUR MMO titles including Star Trek Online, Champions Online, Neverwinter, and in development a Magic The Gathering MMO.
---
Like ANet, Cryptic can be incredibly cryptic with upcoming content to the point that they flat out banned all data mining including banning players and fleets (guilds) who were doing it. But even they realized that as the game is getting older there are more and more calls of DOOM THE GAME IS DYING. SO to help that, 8.5 years after release we got our first ever roadmap post. We have now gotten 3 roadmaps and the most recent one was posted August 3rd and includes content until January 2020 as they are not ready to announce the anniversary event just yet, but they showed the trailer for said event at Star Trek Las Vegas to a closed audience but let people post pictures and talk about it online. Here is a link to that latest roadmap: https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/11222463-2019%2F2020-roadmap%21 It is incredibly basic and simple. Here is a month, here is the major thing happening, here is a reward you'll get or something coming to the store. Such a simple post that adds so much clarity and sense of safety to those playing knowing that there is at least work being done and content coming even if you may not like said content as many Trekkies are not huge fans of Discovery.
---
So moving back to Guild Wars. This post is not being removed. All reports will be ignored because with everything going on right now we are absolutely right to ask ANet to give us a real roadmap for the future of the game. We are bleeding hardcore players and when they leave the rest of the game suffers, that is a fact. Star Trek Online almost died 6 years ago because they drove away hardcore players with a bad expansion. Took 2 years for most of them to come back, myself included. I'm excited for the new season but right now we keep being told things are coming with no idea when. WvW is in media blackout other than yeah we're working on it. Raids and Fractals were not even mentioned today which is a flat out insult to all of those players. 
---
Everyone is upset at everyone right now and many people are flat out depressed at the state of the game, the sub, the community, and everything. I'm one of them and I don't even have time to deal with it right now but we need to come together and voice our concerns as a calm collective community so we can see some real change and updates. We finally saw some good things this summer with balance notes a few days in advance and a bit more honesty and upfront about other things. HOpefully that will continue, but we need a lot more.
---
Imagine he's really in there alone doing wvw :'D (bro, call me - i can help on weekends)
---
when you run out of shit to say so you come back to the old "u white knight"
---
im a white knight because i separate my expectations from my hopes? did you expect more wvw stuff or did you hope for it? why not find a BETTER (and i mean that with 0 sarcasm) game? If they wont listen, why not? If gw2 isnt the game for you any more why not leave? Why give them money? Why waste time and energy when they wont listen to you? Let it die in it's mediocrity. 
---
But im not gonna act like they promised you the shit you were hoping for
---
I look at it like this. If I am going to see a movie, a sequel, and the trailer looks lame and more of the same. I don't really care about the reason why; I'm not interested in spending money to see it. That doesn't make me heartless or a bad person if there was trouble during the production or people got laid off as that literally has nothing to do with me as a consumer. I certainly feel for them but I don't have to want what they're selling either.
---
Around 5 of the big names left including IFlynn and Reaper with many others who weren't as widely known.
---
Well done not bothering to understand though.
---
Yeah thats what the playerbase that actually plays those game modes actually want. Dumb cosmetic skins and content thats somehow even easier than wing 7.
---
According to people that have met him in person, he is just a shy and reserved guy.
---
The art book and the music stream, ok, that's kinda nice things
---
But those strange looking t-shirts and the plastic toys?
---
Very little sleep before the event would be my guess.
---
I literally did this last week, in front of full office during our quarterly meeting.
---
The forever "it's free" argument in f2p game models, proving once again how little people know what they talk about, and while normally id take my time to talk more about how "it's free" doesn't help your cause/point, there is a comment below that I saw and made my day so I going to bother that and ask the same question: are your parents cousins?
---
Oh we have the downvote police here
---
As someone who plays exclusively WvW the game is basically dead to me and I don't mean dead as in I'm just up and quiting the game.  I am still logging in frequently but a lot of the time I don't actually end up playing the game.  I want to play it, I just cannot find the people to do so.  The WvW game mode is suffering hard.  I look if there is stuff to do and often times there nothing so I just log out.
---
The lack of balance and updates has made the game mode stale and the population is now in a freefall.  Many pugmanders have quit and without anyone to follow newer players are lost and not sticking around.  Many experienced players have quit and guilds disbanded.  The experienced players trying to stick around experience the frustration of not being able to form a compentant smaller group to fight a bigger group.
---
It seems like no one is happy whether they be a new player, a weekend casual, or a  veteran player.  At this point, to someone like me, a balance patch and relink is 20x more exciting than a living story update.  I feel like with today's announcement we just past the point of no return.  The population is going to be ravaged and no future updates will bring back enough people for the game mode to recover.
---
The game is 7 years old and it had a good run, it's just a shame, I feel like it could have kept going had they devoted more resources to it.
---
I don’t understand this argument. I pay for the game and they provide the service to entertain me, it’s that simple. I don’t care the company’s internal shit. If a restaurant that I love and regularly visit suddenly serve me shit food because they fired their chefs do I still eat there and support the restaurant? No I don’t I’ll leave a bad review and switch to another restaurant.
---
&gt;new elite specs are not gonna be released in the future
---
This is basically a given based on how much trouble they've had keeping all the current balls in the air and no new paid expansions.  
---
You're better off just staying on the mail list and moving on.
---

Sand Cascade: Reduce the barrier granted by this skill by 33% in WvW &amp; PvP.
---
Sand Flare: Reduced the barrier granted by this skill by 25% in WvW.
---
barrier born to be part of scourge spec to become the less class giving it....meanwhile even war will give barrier,gg anet.
---
Peak viewership was somewhere around 30-35k on twitch
---
Basically wasted a week for me cuz i could not decide a main and was hoping for some l33t specs because 'expansion like features' but no. So anyone... what class uses 2h weapons the most? I find using one hand weapons very ugly and les powerful. I also like shields. Was thinking guardian because gs and hammer but apparently hammer sucks anyways on anything. Necro then? Reaper or some shit idk. Guardian? I think im gonna go necro asura or guardian norn. F i dont know. Thief? Fk
---
I got my in game mail but there was nothing attached to it. Is there another email to follow?
---
What? It is literally just a name.
---
&gt;when you run out of shit to say so you come back to the old "u white knight"
---
Was i supposed to find something to say to a drone? You won't bother to understand anyway since it goes against your "ANet does no wrong!! mentality.
---
You gonna keep this up? I was laughing at first but now it's just sad.
---
I played probably most of mmorpg out there, in my opinion, they are so much much worse (even wow after last exp), that gw2 doesn’t even have to do much to keep me there. I’ve never noticed, that mmorpg have problems with updates cause i haven’t payed attention to it. Well, now I feel less sad, actually, so thanks.
---
Take a break and do something else.  No need for all this melodrama.
---
everyone has access to the feature
---
50% of streamers actively use it
---
&gt;its not created by twitch so that anet could use it  
---
&gt;in fact if they didn't that would be a valid thing to be annoyed with because why wouldn't they schedule their live announcement
---
why didn't you quote this part? because "winning" for you is as easy as quoting the stuff that suits your narrative
---
like you expecting for wvw content for no reason
---
Its a different type of content, so im happy, idk why ppl always complain about everything, just chill wth, i play this game since launch and still consider it my main mmo.
---
"I feel like Matt's unintentionally implying that players are somehow rooting against ArenaNet here, that we wanted the livestream to be a disaster or something."
---
Really? Have you read the posts here, on twitch on youtube and so on? Because i would say that at least half of those are telling flat out that the game is dead, we should uninstall, that we should place dislikes on everything we can that have to do with the game. I can go in and on and it is getting even worse if i would do that.
---
And if anyone here is trying to write anything that they like about the game, the anouncement or just ask questions they get downvote to oblivion and told to shut up and get the hell out. 
---
And yet you do not feel that this group is not trying to sink the game? They are just disapointed...
---
Well i am disapointed about the part of WvW. Really disapointed, and yet i really thought it was a good trailer, Very deep compared to what we usually get, very cinamatic and very interesting hints on what the future hold. They renamed it to a saga and told there will be more dept. They litterally said this flat out. Which indicate they have listen and are now working on changes. If that fall out well we will see.
---
So even though i am dispointed about no info around WvW, i do not throw out rants nor do i tell people to dislike videos or that everybody should leave and play something else. I dont tell new players to get the fuck out, or tell others who have something nice to say about the game to fluff off. 
---
So why should disapointement make this sort of behaviour ok?
---
Both the lay offs and cancellations happened for a reason. Anet is not a good guy in this story.
---
Also, if not for NCsoft you would never be able to play GW at all.
---
Farewell, may the life treat you better.
---
Warframe's Rebecca Ford and the entire dev team are seriously stupidly good at keeping the community in the loop and announcing things. I honestly have yet to see another studio do it just as good.
---
Good reply, drone, thanks for playing.
---
Too dumb to even know EA is still doing bullshit in 2019.
---
Dude, for real, your stupidity is legit hurting at this point.
---
With a style so simple it's almost inevitable someone would make something so similar looking;  For a moment I thought the maker of Cyanide and Happiness played GW2. lol
---
Completely agree with you. It could have been something to add to the hype; not the byproduct itself
---
Honestly I prefer to have new encounters with dedicated rewards. But I cleared all the raids etc, so... Eh. An easy mode would be worthless for me.
---
That way they make content interesting for both me and those who can't clear a normal raid boss.
---
Big meaty weapons? Warrior.
---
Jeah, but I like Raids and WvW. I don't like the Living World, because it is just boring in my opinion - so, it's not the content I wanna play, so it's not content for me.
---
Did they say that WvW would be talked about at this event? No? Did they say that this event would involve season five? Yes? Then they had no obligation to talk about WvW.
---
Aw man, you hurt my feelings. I'm not a white knight! :(
---
Nah but for real, this is stupid. I'm not defending ANet. I'm only arguing for the inarguable definition of WORDS. Living World and achievements are content. Doesn't matter if you like them or not.
---
lol I don't fucking care  
---
When people say content they mean actual gameplay content and we all understand this to be the case.   
---
Being pedantic to be "correct" just makes you look silly.
---
Longer than that if you wanna go back to Guild Wars 1 which had a very nice system for saving and sharing them...
---
Except what they showed today is that GW2 is not fully staffed again.  It has a comparable crew to what was putting out living story, with not a lot more in the works.  It is good to know that hasn't been disrupted, but this shows that they didn't make a big pivot back to GW2.  That is a fair reason for disappointment.
---
A.Net still has one of the most impressive art teams in the industry, and we have no idea what they are working on.  They have a lot of headcount across the org that is not working on GW2, even after the layoffs.  What are they working on?  No teasers.  Nothing has changed.
---
The casual demographic that spends the most money isn’t the core player base though.
---
Stop skipping over my points, where did i poorly say that anet does no wrong?
---
&gt; You do know people ARE leaving more and more, right? 
---
Good, they got the IQ to just do it and not waste time, toxicity and money in the game and on the forums
---
They don't just stay there, expecting things to change on their own, clapping when they see "Anet bad" with 1.8k upvotes
---
npc
---
Protip: not every Reddit user lives in Yankeestan.
---
Have you seen some Warframes **weekly** streams? I've approached that game this month and joined just one of them.
---
It was mindblowing see them talk so openly about the next updates and plans for the future. And they were not overpromising or anything: they were actually talking just about what they were working on and even the twitch chat was pretty chill.
---
I would kill every favorite quaggan of the devs with my bare hands to have that **monthly** on GW2 if I could.
---
How is Living World NOT content? I'd like to see you argue that, because you would be wrong.
---
convince you of what. what side do you think im on. im so confused by your stance that at this point id like to just know what you think of todays announcement.
---
Just remember that only few percent of players do raids and fractals...
---
I would love to see features like:
---
Player homes, bestiary, library, new elites. All of those could have some monetization included.
---
There was a lot announced, including an entire new mastery track for season 5..? I don't get the "was that it" reaction at all
---
Stream the soundtrack on Tidal!
---
The trailer is really superb. I really liked it. Despite the disappointment of everything else. Maybe that, and the physical event were all their budget.
---
I did play it casually for a few years, the combat is really no different than a lot of other MMOs out currently.
---
ESO, BDO, TERA...they're all basically the same combat style.
---
I then saw the direction it was going and bailed.
---
I don't see how gw2 can compete with subfee games like FF14... Quality and content come at a price. You need a much bigger team to deliver many things at once... 
---
Look at FF14. It's backed by square and has been on a constant spiraling course since 2015, reaching new heights just about 2 months ago when the third expac was released. I wish gw2 would deliver regular content, expacs, new classes, ... Well, basically what FF14 is doing. But without proper fundings that will remain a dream.
---
Okay, but I repeat myself: I don't care what content anyone likes. That isn't what I'm arguing. I'm saying that every game mode is content.
---
I like the light one. I can cosplay a crusader of the sea I wanted with it.
---
Wow, I just found something from this stream that I will look forward to.
---
He always seems tired and nervous. It’s a stressful job.
---
6/10 haha you had expectations and expectations are the first step to disappointment
---
so instead of taking 2 to 5 minutes of just a quick mention of the WvW rewards and alliances, we got "soon"? nice.
---
We probably really should. I do.
---
Goodbye WvW, goodbye spvp, dead game modes now. I can't believe they hyped this up so much for what is essentially just a LW announcement. Anet are seriously misreading the player base.
---
This. I get that they had layoffs... but then why do such a big announcement at all? They could've continued without it. Saved the money. Published two blogposts. That would've been fine. I wouldn't have cared. Yet they announce this event in advance. Hype it up and then say "We continue like always!"
---
&gt;  The same people responsible for the layoffs and cancelling Anet's other projects. 
---
Another drone blaming NCSoft.
---
Yeah, lets ignore, again, that it was ANet's higher ups that were diverting time and resources AWAY from GW2 for those other projects, even if it meant the MMO would falter. Let's ignore that and blame big bad NCSoft again.
---
Might get back into WF  
---
Is Nidus still a beast?
---
My level 53 Charr and Norn are happy that they finally get out of bag opening in the arse end of Lion's arch.
---
&gt;Legit
---
You stuck in 2009 for real?
---
&gt; Good reply, drone, thanks for playing. 
---
Copy pasting my shit doesn't mean anything when theres no context. Again, it's not 2009 where you can just reply with a copy paste and a pic of a simpsons character walking away from a fire.
---
It still has more than the event.
---
WvW still has balance issues with regard to guilds server stacking, and the fact that there is (was, I haven't played in a long time) a fee to switch servers. After I left original and came back to HoT, the server I was on was flat empty in wvw.
---
Thats what echo chambers are. They will never learn until they can accept criticism, the world isnt sunshine and rainbows sweetheart, in order to better your product you better listen to your customers on some things. And ffs get rid of the upper management  that knows absolutely shit all about western mmos
---
And still no revert on the IP change on Chrono. Skip
---
Because hes trolling. Hes trying to stoke the fire while actually not quitting the game. There is a lot of that going around.
---
Well, did our questions get answered yesterday in the stream?
---
But what warrants your sense of blind optimism?  Why would this outcry be any different, compared to all the others (literally since game release, as this commenter pointed out) ?
---
detection pulse being back might
---
Is this a joke?
---
Gw2 was alive...
---
Gosh theses feelings from looking that annoucement.. i could even forget Pof tears. That was the game we deserve.
---
Sigh, your idiocy infecting my messages is legit starting to irritate. You've been sucking up to Anet time and time again, don't suddenly try to say otherwise.
---
drone, now buzz off and continue sucking Anet's balls.
---
Countdown pretty much guaranteed disappointment.
---
Ya don't tease shit unless it's like, really ground breaking
---
You can go through my post history, 'cause I was spitting fire o reddit all evening.
---
If it's not too much for you, that is.
---
You can fail. And , no wonder the cc phases are so bad. People like you spamming 1!
---
I would pay both
---
Did you read just the title?!?
---
Huh, I must have missed it. I checked but did not see it. Thanks!
---
\*tries looking for details, still confused as fuck\*
---
A blog post gave us more information than the live announcement Anet spent thousands on. This is why I get so annoyed with Anet. Sure, invest money to promote the game but lets do it the right way. I still stand by whoever is making these decisions at Anet need to be replaced. They're doing so much harm to the game they're in control of.
---
Honestly, if anything, I appreciate Greg Miller just for this.
---
The point Matthew is missing entirely, and i mean entirely, is that the devs do absolutely amazing work, and the management just repeatedly FAILS to present it in a way that doesn't lead to disappointment. There are so many ways to announce things that wouldn't lead to what is happening right now. So many. It's not the devs fault, and accusing us of feeling that way is akin to gaslighting.
---
Lure in unsuspected payers :\_:
---
As a fellow Floridian preparing for the hurricane, I wish you the best of luck and that you are able to stay safe. Hopefully we can be back in Tyria soon &lt;3
---
People wanted to hear about WvW/raids/PvP/fractals. They didn't get that, so they're acting like spoiled children.
---
No, but copy pasting your own stupid words when they apply to YOU perfectly sounds just right with me :)
---
Now buzz off drone, stop infecting my messages with your idiotic white knighting.
---
With the Kodan being highlighted a bit in the trailer, that gave me a little hope, but I doubt they will make them playable.
---
How can people be this blind. Disgusting. Anet did a terrible job, and they deserve the backlash. 
---
They only know to things, too much hype, or none. Both is useless.
---
&gt;Honestly I prefer to have new encounters with dedicated rewards. But I cleared all the raids etc, so... Eh. 
---
Right, so easy mode would not be for you, but the overwhelming majority of players have not completed the raids, so easy mode raids would be for them. 
---
I'm just so sick and tired of attempts to "onboard" players into difficult content. "Oh, we'll put in a 'training mode' that will let players do some of the things from the difficult mode, and then they will want to do the difficult mode like we do." **NO.** The point of an easy mode is not to convince people to do the hard mode, it is to be a *substitute* for the hard mode, for players that *will never want to do the hard mode.*
---
It's ok for the easy mode to be worthless to you, because the hard mode is worthless to most other players.
---
FFXIV and ESO are both incredibly solid games, with frequent content updates, how do they suck?
---
It's not prioritized for deluxe owners, I received mine hours ago and I have standard edition.
---
I got my ((946345)), did you?
---
[https://i.imgur.com/XMYs1o3.png](https://i.imgur.com/XMYs1o3.png)
---
Thank you ArenaNet. It looks like that to get some answers and plans for the future we have to always make a ruckus on the subreddit and on twitch streams.  
---
Can we just skip the ruckus entirely and get back again on talking between us?  
---
Sincerely, 
---
someone playing with you since 2012

I still stand by whoever is making these decisions at Anet need to be replaced. They're doing so much harm to the game. Its time for someone new to take over who is willing to take risks.
---
and dont come back o/
---
Well...... THERES ALWAYS BLIZZARD RELEASING NEW CONTENT. Oh, wait. Wow classic is old content, refurbished and people are FLOCKING. FLOCK away then!
---
Yeah i'll go through it for sure. But i seriously dont understand this way you're talking to me, like im not admitting something lmao. whatever. your account is amonth old, you dont see me making up reasons for that on your behalf.
---
FYI - I'm among dissapointed players.

There is something to be said (well, WP says it here) that the trailer is clearly not just about Jormag. The burnt charr and cub at the beginning suggests Primordus may be active. The scene of the lone ship on fire suggests either Primordus or possibly the DSD. And the centaur slave-driver is yet another thing.
---
Like, yes, everyone has justified gripes with the presentation, but it gives the impression they have long-term plans, not short-term ones.
---
They called the next release a prologue, but know that it will have a new zone (in Grothmar) and may be comparable to a season 4 episode. And that launches in two weeks.
---
--
---
On the note of the plot itself, the fact that the trailer seemed to hint at the other two remaining dragons just as much as Jormag may suggest that Jormag knows something we don't about the others, or that we might actually need to seek his help to deal with them.
---
Boy have I got some bad news for you regarding that logic :x
---
Best trailer yet imo!
---
Bro, there's no subscription fee, most of the content is free and there's no pay to win model. 
---
Name me another MMO as popular as GW2 that meets that criteria.
---
Harsh truth, but boy oh boy people do *not* like to hear this message.
---
&gt;im not gonna act like they promised shit they ddint
---
They flatout said we were getting expansion-level content.
---
More things the little drone apparently didn't know, surprising? Not really.
---
woke up and gotta get this off my mind.. living world seasons are not a viable model for an mmo. if this is what they plan on going with for the near future, than better kiss the game goodbye. the casuals want expansions. casuals could care less about story.
---
*looks at Shadowbringers marketing in comparison*
---
Yeah Anet uh.....you....tried.
---
&gt; what have ArenaNet been doing the last two years if there was no expansion half baked before the layoffs even happened?
---
working on a different game with nothing to show for it because it was mismanaged.
---
&gt; much better bandaid community management techniques
---
what the f does "bandaid" mean here really?  Like there is some permanent community management techniques?
---
I like to compare and contrast ANet with CCP and DE because how much of a fail ANet was acting on community outreach compare to the other two.
---
I know more about the latter two than ANet nowadays since I've long stopped playing GW2.  Still, I feel funny to see someone dissing DE's community management on the gw2 subreddit, though.
---
Not the same concept, hope you don't have kids.
---
Which is fine. But we don't even know "what" they intend to do. Look at all the bingo board posts. So much was up in the air because Anet didn't tell us what they were working on.  A roadmap doesn't have to be a set in stone timeline.
---
In the agile sense the players are Anet stakeholders so why can't we get a Sprint review outlook for the game?
---
Considering its the content that is driving this game. Crystal desert is empty 95% of the time aside from a few areas. WvW still has full instances despite it literally not getting anything impactful besides warclaw in YEARS.
---
&gt; this is the level of hype and reach that we need to attract new and returning players
---
New player will probably get nothing from todays announcement. Without expansions it's hard to make people see the proper entry point to an old game like this.
---
I'll give you a call when I start to care.
---
I'm not excited for another LWS, that's all.
---
Occam's razor. Talking to a crowd is prolly not one of his strong points. 
---
Being an orator requires a very different skill set than being a dev, and a good one would never feel nervous even if he/she was trying to sell the turd that anet showcased today.
---
That's just it though, I'm super pumped for the next saga.
---
I only dissapointed myself I guess, because I thought too much of it all, I expected there was way more they would reveal even though they did not say so.
---
I hoped there was more, it seemed they were gonna tell more (big hype up and theatre), there wasn't more, I was let down a bit.
---
Still, super pumped :)
---
Don't you like having your skills and gear replaced in the final conclusion and finale of an elder dragon fight? A model that they worked on for half a year and you'll never see again? You damn elitist.
---
If they keep going on this way i don't care at all, that's not the game i loved. I just want one thing : knowledge of the future, the little flame is still burning and i want to know if it's worth or not.
---
The main issue is less the actual stream and the fact that they felt this was deserving of a special PAX event, complete with a big event timer and not just one of their own live streams or a blog post.
---
Why use the derpiest image for the phone case? They should have just gone with the Guild Wars 2 logo.
---
They also said they could expand existing maps, season 4 maps are big in size but imagine a core map extended with a smaller portion, like season 3 maps. But it's still "maybe" "guess" since we know almost nothing even after this show. It could still be 4-5 months and no new map :lulz:
---
LW is like 4-5 hours of content every 4 months. It’s content, just nowhere near enough to sustain the game.
---
FF 14
---
I think i kinda get what you are saying, even if it sounds weird to me.  
---
Whatever floats your boat probably..
---
Does that mean that we'll see some Jora/Svanir action? Or will Jhavi carve her name in GW franchise the same way Jora did?
---
People are getting fed up and today was very important for some to decide if they continue to invest their time and money into the game.
---
Sorry, I'm having multiple conversations with people and got mixed up.
---
I would still argue that achievements are content. The repetitious ones less so, but nonetheless they are something to DO, and there are people who find them entertaining.
---
They said there are now 4 teams dedicated to living world which likely means that will be their main focus for the foreseeable future while they slowly drip feed content for the other areas of the game. If you're not interested in the story of this game then you're out of luck because that's what they've doubled down on. The cinematic with Rytlock looked nice at least.
---
Its been this way since the last LS update. So many people here can't realize they do more damage to the game than Anet is.
---
&gt;but be damn sure it constructive criticism 
---
people tried that. for years. what you are seeing is the end stage where people are tired and angry and on the verge of apathy, just letting all their frustration out. it will be over in a few months and people will just stop caring because no matter how much they try, they can't fix the game, only anet can and they have shown that they are incapable of doing so. people are gonna cut ties and in a year or so this game will be pretty much dead with only the toxic casuals who told everyone to leave logging in once a month to buy their new shiny and run around in open world for an hour to cry "but where is everyone?!?!"
---
Yep I am in the same boat x\_x.
---
You only like 2vs2? I would be happy for 2vs2 ranked or unranked queues to be permanent, but I think the devs are scared of splitting the population. 
---
Personally I am not upset by longer queues. I don't play unranked off season because there no longer is a balance patch off season to test new builds, and unranked matchmaker seems to work badly. I would rather wait longer for better games, then win or lose 500-100 which seems to be the case in unranked. I think in a way 2vs2 is more accessable for new players as they don't have the added dimension of worrying about rotations, and can just worry about pvp.
---
I would also say that variety in pvp matters a lot to me. Some people are upset about Djinns Dominion in ranked, but I am really happy just for the variety of maps. I have like 8k pvp games played at this point, new game modes with a queue is sort of like a mini expansion for me, second only to new elite specs.
---
But you didn't actually answer the question, you gave a shitty, snide remark.
---
First off, there are more than 4 hours of content each patch if you include both story and medium-core open world stuff. A lot more.
---
Second, just because some people tear through that in a day doesn't mean the average player does. Most people, the core player base, probably never hit a skyscale timegate, because they play fewer than 2 hours a day. At that rate, DF brought in weeks of content for even a fairly casual player. They come in and experience the majority of the content and then leave until there is more.
---
An MCU "core audience member" doesn't chat about it on forums or watch each move 30 times or theorycraft multiverse shit, they watch every movie. Similarly, the core GW2 audiencr plays all of the main content and says "meh" to the hardcore stuff.
---
What you like barely qualifies as content.
---
Suddenly all the shills and white knights are coming out.
---
Could be viewed as saving other people from wasting their time.
---
Hi, I play GW2 since release, on and off, and I usually just do the Living World stories and etc.
---
I have *no idea* what the content creators do or are, or what the heck is a commander. I play as an Engineer with that hammer-thing-build and I tried to stack Toughness because I wanted to be tough.
---
People gotta remember that this is a *game* first, and the usual player don't look for guides for a game they play casually - they just jump in, play, have fun, and then when they stop having fun, they jump to the next thing.
---
Effectively just a continuation of their normal releases which are a LS plus some other features.
---
Who knows? Maybe that's the feeling I'm having, reading this, or I used an opportunity to get upvotes for a simple riposte.
---
Maybe both.
---
Who knows.
---
Short version. A-Net had  to go through a steel bath earlier this year, lots of layoffs. Today they had a thingy at a theatre in Seattle, where they announced a new living world season, taking a sort of new direction for the storyline (living world is basically content drops they roll out between expansions, usually with much less fanfare). They also announced that everyone that buys the latest expansion Path of fire, will get the previous expansion Heart of thorns bundled in for no extra cost.
---
People are dissapointed because they had hope for news on content they like (PvP and WvW mostly). 
---
Personally I had hoped for that to, but I still think it's  good that they do this now, since the community has veen restless since the layoff announcements.
---
Ugh. *Of course* they're still doing this.
---
I don't know why people are acting surprised that a game dev studio was working on other unannounced games which got canceled
---
Starcraft: Ghost ring a bell? From Blizzard's golden years a game which cost them a lot of money to develop and then cancel. One of the major reasons cited at the time was the explosion of popularity World of Warcraft saw so they just slowly reduced resources on it until the vaporware faded into the ether.
---
The gaming industry is a pretty fickle one. You always have to be pumping out something new/different to pick up more players, but sometimes you're better off creating a brand new IP than continuing a sequel so that potential incomers don't feel like they missed a critical jump in point.
---
could just be that anet was mismanaging resources, could be that they were expanding into new ips — we're probably never going to have closure on that beyond NCSoft demanded they stop working on non-gW2 projects.
---
either way it was pretty explicit that the merch segment was by ncsoft
---
Being the kind of game that GW2 is, and using a GTX1050, I can guarantee you that the GPU is not the bottleneck (the only thing lowering the resolution affects).
---
&gt; we still are getting more content on top of all that we already have, **for free**, and that’s something. I know it probably sounds like a weak argument—“you got gruel today, be grateful you didn’t starve because we could have just given you nothing”—**but consider the alternative**.
---
The alternative: a lot of content in exchange for money? Yes, I like that.
---
Hey Lamia, you french bastard. Thanks for all you taught me. Maybe see you in another game, I'm done too.
---
xoxo,
---
Spike
---
It probably is but lets be real, combat in XIV is boring as hell.
---
What details?
---
&gt;Negative posters just over-expected stuff
---
Wrong. Anet was the one that told us there would be more, they over-hyped it, THEY specifically said there would be expansion-level content for this, not us.
---
Enough with the damn obsession with defending these people when THEY are the ones that fuck up.
---
I'm excited that it appears Jormag will have an actual personality and quite a devilish one based on temptation and appealing to pride in the commander. Should be interesting unless all the default responses our character have are cheesy heroic "I'll never join you!" stuff.
---
Make it a struggle, give the Commander some depth.
---
at this point it's more surprising when they actually tell the truth
---
Yikes.
---
Just because someone has suggested it doesn't mean it can't be new for this game. Just saying
---
Hardcore doesn't care about the story, they just do it as fast as possible cause it's content/ap/new map/masteries/farm/skins/.. but that's all, the ones who care about the story (which i know) are only casuals who play under 5h a week.
---
 Expansions are way more marketable, earn money, and introduce new things. But to be fair, i don't think a third expansion of gw2 will even help. HoT was about group content with meta-events. Pof was a solo, casual experience. Right now they just fill the gemstore. And if they don't work to renew things like they did with Hot it will not even keep veterans in the game.
---
The trailer was great! I am genuinely hyped for art direction towards future releases. Also the voice over was perfect!!
---
Pretty much. The reason why GW2 isn't permanently on maintenance mode right now is specifically BECAUSE NCSoft told ANet to stop that bullshit and divert all of their budget back on GW2.
---
I think they're trying to grab the types of players who are into Monster Hunter.  Bounties were also a shot at that but didn't really turn out well.  
---
While this style of encounter isn't my cup of tea, I think these could turn out better for everyone if they stick with the more "normal" mechanics seen in raids, FotM and LS4 bosses as opposed to the ones bounty bosses use that are frequently alien to EVERYTHING else in the game.
---
We can't help a game that can't help itself being relevant.
---
Especially when communication is one-way only.
---
&gt; THANK YOU. "somehow linked with the devs as individuals" is horse shit to anyone who has actually read some of the toxicity here. 
---
Please cite me this massive outpouring of toxicity against the devs personally or the quality of their work.
---
As a player of WvW, it allows me to uninstall the game. Because even with the recent survey they have proved once again they don’t care about the WvW game mode. ...F
---
GGG also does a fantastic job of keeping the community appeased, because their update cycle has been consistent to a big update every 3 months, which is enough for PoE because of the way the entire game is build. Their community interactions is also rather vivid with Bex being one, if not the best, community manager I know.
---
So, Game of Thrones/wrath of the lich king?
---
meanwhile, pso2(released the same year as gw2) has a roadmap on its main site. 
---
they recently announced a new class(like a couple of weeks ago) with concrete info on its release date along with an early pretest if you go to their company building (i think) in october. they even told us that the new class would be coming at the end of the year a few months ago, too(february?).
---
even class balance updates have at least a semi concrete list of stuff they plan on implementing, rather than forcing people to wait and pray if their favorite would say weak or not. the list itself was created directly from their, i'm going to say monthly?, surveys they've been doing lately.
---
Sincerely thank you and you're 100% right. SWTOR has also gone through something similar and is now doing roadmaps.
---
I think there community management is excellent. 
---
I'm saying that the underlying problems are actually remarkably similar. And community management doesn't fix the problem, it only fixes the fallout. ANet could use alot community management. However the greater issue here is, as I said, developer resources being dictated by the monetization of the casual playerbase. That's just the harsh reality. And no amount of roadmaps, or twitch streams will fix that.
---
Personally, I prefer the harsh reality of them telling us dungeons won't be supported, or that they can't do legendaries. It sucks yeah, but it's better then being strung along with empty promises, as ANet has been with raids, WvW, and PvP. All of which have clearly been struggling. To me, those are permanent solutions.
---
PepeLaugh he doesn't know
---
Actually retarded
---
Isnt it better that they know the state of the game rather than waste their time and money for expectations that will never be met.
---
I feel like physical assault is part of normal Charr debate. &gt;.&gt;
---
Oh, well called. I'm impressed and sad at the same time.
---
ArenaNet reached enough new players with their "event" today.  I wouldn't worry too much, okay? It's better to let people vent their frustrations and make peace with their feelings than get in their way.  The best thing you can do isn't actually to camp starter zones like Queensdale.  I'd argue it's to camp Verdant Brink &amp; Amnoon Oasis -- players where boosted players will end up.
---
&gt; EDIT: can someone explain to me why this is being downvoted? I'm telling you how things work in the tech industry..... The reaction I'm seeing is EXACTLY why these things are done
---
You're being downvoted on your #2 point. No one is doing what you're saying they are. What you're doing is strawmanning at best, gaslighting at worst. And that is why you're being downvoted.
---
Fellow STO player o7
---
Agreed. So the OP wants people to keep quiet the problems and lie? Maybe censor us while you're at it? ANet messed up and the need this so they know.
---
my thing with the easy raids that are not raids is we had that with dungeons. Just rework dungeons and make them a little more challenging and then you have raids that are not raids.
---
This is too complex to resolve in a reddit post, tbh. ANet could have been really close to completing Guild Wars 3 or whatever and it just was NCSoft deciding that they couldn't let them develop their other projects anymore. Developers divert time/resources from their games all the time. It sucks when things don't pan out, but no one's angry at Blizzard for taking time away from World of Warcraft to develop Hearthstone. Okay, people TOTALLY are, but no one cares about those people because the thing got done. So there's two worlds we could think of: One in which ANet just needed another X amount of time to develop their side project but NCSoft came in and muddled where it didn't belong and now we won't see that for the foreseeable future. The other is the one where NCSoft comes in and saves ANet from itself.  I genuinely don't think we can tell what happened unless a dev decides to violate their contract and spill the beans. There's been more than enough examples of publishers fucking with good devs and more than enough examples of bad devs over-reaching.
---
If they dont change something then it will be dead. Im sorry but you cant keep people with nothing but in shop items and side stories. If they dont want to put expansions in anymore then fine, they need to put that type of content in, that means new zones new raids new fracts maps and changes to pvp and wvw, new specs new races maybe a new class. You can spread it out over a year by releasing a couple of things every month or two, but you have to give players something to do outside of a one hour story.
---
Just play ff14
---
Because PAX is a huge event that sells out 100% every year, I wouldn't be surprised if you really do have to reserve that early.
---
on top of that, why the fuck aren't the OST's released already on youtube/spotify etc.
---
You're right, it wasn't inherently bad.
---
It was horrid.
---
I am very sorry for him, but I do think he knew it was not enough.
---
They should've just made a roadmap and a blogpost, not send mails everywhere for an event catered to new players.
---
Tech isnt there yet lul
---
Brilliant counterargument, thank you for your input.
---
I can't make any concrete offers but if you send me a code I'll have an announcement to talk about my plans for an offer in the coming months.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/86058/about-the-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-veteran-s-package/p1?new=1
---
You should contact customer support.
---
HoT and PoF is but what about the LS and original score?
---
There's a whole world of entertainment out there. So many activities, books, games, music, movies... GW2 is not special. If a company decides to lay off so many people and lower the scale of their updates then don't act surprised when people are a bit disappointed - especially with all this build up AN gave us. I was playing GW games casually since the first one came out (kinda quit during season 4 of GW2) and the next living story won't bring me back. I want meat. I want features. Not a 3h experience every few months. I'm happy for all the people that enjoy the current Living Stories and I wish the game and devs all the best but I'm afraid GW2 is finally venturing onto the path of struggling mmos. Hopefully I'm wrong.
---
&gt;Are they going to be aware that GW2 players are getting all these great new content regularly for free?
---
Yes, just make a blog post, post a short video talking about it or talk with gaming news sites so they can help spread the word.
---
NOT renting a theater or doing full countdowns as if this was something huge.
---
Wooden, we need you right now, we cannot just accept that this new "focused vision" is the same size and scope of every previous living world. Nothing about today said "expansion-like". Nothing. I am excited for the story, I am not excited for the future of the literal game itself.
---
Yeah but Anets idea of fun is spamming 1 on world bosses and watching interactive cutscenes \*cough\* living world \*cough\*
---
In general I think "the internet" has turned a lot more sour over the years. People expect more and swallow less. That being said, I don't think it's wrong to voice criticism of the direction one of our favorite franchises is going. Although this outrage might be over the top, it was to be expected. Anet could have anticipated this reaction. Everybody did on this sub, at least.
---
Yeah, I blatantly ripped off their style, but it's good enough to get through of what I think and it ain't takes me ages to draw it.
---
Hehe I just made both together (in the amount of gold it would take to buy either one of them) l. Took twice as long to gather gold/resources... But why not!
---
We arent youre friends or family, we are people who give you money to deliver a product that we like. If you don't do that, then yes we are unhappy with you.  We will praise them when they deliver on the hype train.
---
There is no doubt that the story will be good. But story alone will not keep players. Just look at the dwindling population.
---
You make a product we are expected to put money and time into one way or another. Fuck off with the sob story. We don't owe you anything.
---
&gt;Starcraft: Ghost
---
Yeah, compare that from gaming megatitan Activision Blizzard to dinky ArenaNet REMOVING RESOURCES from GW2 to funnel them into the other projects.
---
but the devs reply to my reddit posts and talk in LA map chat :((((
---
If what Matthew meant by "hasn't missed a beat" is that Anet hasn't communicated shit in the 6 months before the massive layoffs and hasn't communicated shit int he 6 months since, then he's absolutely right.
---
If you don't like this subreddit, then leave.
---
You kinda missed the point, its a way for them to get more funding to make more content, not more content itself.
---
&gt;And what do you get? For easy mode they should put some stupid level rewards for the players doing them, and then what?
---
No, the rewards would Have to be the same. Again, it's a *replacement* for the current hard mode, not just "something else." It needs to be something where players would *never* have to do the hard mode unless they *enjoy* hard mode. 
---
Again, *stop trying to convince players to do hard mode if they don't enjoy hard mode.* If you enjoy hard mode, then easy mode is not for you, it has nothing to do with you.
---
You keep saying no sub as if that's universally a good thing.... the top two mmo's on the market are sub.
---
Same old excuses from Anet
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Kk3CDbAO0M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Kk3CDbAO0M)
---
Well if gw2 marketing wasn't only about word of mouth it will be clearly less damaging. But you know what, if people say that they leave that's because they love the game but don't like what it becomes. And after all the time the community wasted on forumsand reddit to say what's wrong, what could be improved, the way anet just ignore his community is hurting way more than people who try to raise their voices in order to grow the community, game.
---
Nobody is saying they should implement stuff or add stuff into the game. Just say we are working on this, this and this and it is expected to come out withnin an year or 2. DONE THATS IT. Thats literally what everyone wants to know...
---
For many players this day was the breaking point after being tired of what Anet gives the non story community.
---
Why do you care what people wear? Are you that superficial?
---
I feel like people don't read anymore
---
It isn't really "suddenly", if you RES Tag every person you see who shills constantly, you start to notice there are a ton of them who pop into nearly every negative thread and shill the game, and then claim they are being bullied and stalked when people call them out on it.
---
&gt;For non-gw2 players out there in the gaming community?
---
For them, they should have released a trailer. The only thing they had at the event was that one trailer anyways, everything else could have been a title card in the trailer. A trailer is also MUCH easier to share with friends than a long dull stream.
---
the problems with arenanet are always the same , now and 6 years ago
---
I generally agree. 
---
I think it’s important to note, however, is that episodic content every 3 months isn’t a fundamentally unsustainable way to release content; it’s what ANet puts in those releases.
---
Story is nice, more open world is nice, and some existing rewards they have implemented (like the ability to get ascended trinkets, new stat combos, new mounts, etc.) do grab my attention—it’s just not for long enough.
---
When ANet said season 5 would contain expansion level content, that did make me hopeful (not anymore after announcement, though, unfortunately). Introducing things such as new especs, a new movement mechanic like gliding or mounts, consistent releases/updates to raids/fractals/PvP/WvW, more rewards (such as skins, gear, unique utility items, AP, gold, what have you, just more of it), or something completely new (like the mastery system introduced in HoT)—all of these would make living world releases much more exciting and long-lived.
---
Another thing to note is that xpacs are in part so appealing because of the sheer quantity of content. Living world episodes... they’re fun and last me personally probably a week or two, but they end up feeling very thin. At the announcement, they did say they had more teams now, which does make me somewhat hopeful.
---
Unless they start adding in the meaty content we all love from xpacs and more of it, too, living world episodes are going to continue to feel like what they eventually evolved to be: filler content between expansions.
---
People claiming that the devs shouldn't take "2 years" to implement core WvW changes are essentially calling those devs inept or unskilled without knowing either context (why), knowing how development works, or both. The impression that those making said comments could "do better". That's not constructive criticism, that's for out insulting the devs themselves
---
I'm sure the devs are malicious and WANT WvW players to suffer. It's totally not that this is a complex issue both technically and logistically. It's like one line of code, right?
---
I get that you're not saying that, but I don't understand the point of posts like this. If they could get it fixed faster, I think they would do so. They know how much of a blight it is on the game to have these issues. Just like they're trying to fix the monthlies. They're not stupid, they just have real challenges stemming (I would argue) from the old engine they're running on that most people at the studio don't know how to run these days. That's what you lose when you lose veteran talent. A lot of the devs might not know all the weird shit under the hood so they work inefficiently. That's why when the devs say that they're communicating better between teams/sharing resources, that's a good thing. Because there's a chance that veteran talent is helping the new people out.
---
But OP wants something with good gameplay... and while it has a ton of content FF14 is borring as hell.
---
The problem is, when it comes to gameplay GW2 is hands down the best MMO out there and this makes it even worse seeing how A-net runs from one desaster into the next one because they refuse to learn how to communicate (and deliver a constant flow of non open world content... and even that is slooooow &lt;\_\_&lt;)
---
There are constructive ways to discuss problems, in an effort to make the game better. Complaining that it's dead is not the way.
---
That's what anet gets for building up hype with nothing to back it up.
---
Maybe if they've given us a road map or an actual plan instead of showing us some concept arts and mocking the pvp wvw Community
---
Too bad that's it's not hard mode. It's *normal* mode for a raid content. Which by nature is meant to be something harder than normal/base content.
---
You're just making it sound like they're forcing Dhuum's CM down your throat at every encounter.
---
And again no. They can't give you the same rewards that a "normal" raider gets. It would throw away the whole point of difficulty and effort  that was put into clearing them.
---
If you want to clear your special snowflake version of the boss, good and could partially agree if gw2 didn't need much more focus on more content and so on and thus had a a part of "free devs" for an easy mode project,but getting the same rewards that I and any other raiders out there got with their effort and dedication is totally out of question.
---
ANet themselves said they were working on a new engine way before GW2 even came out.
---
I mean, a gameplay demo of build templates would be difficult to show well/effectively since it's just switching between builds (and gear, I'm guessing). But storyboards/UI sketches and mock-ups would've gone a long way just so we can see progress actually being made. Gamers, particularly this community, have become jaded to promises without some sort of evidence.
---
yeah me too! Never been a fan of flashy stuff.
---
The outrage exists because people care about the game. If nobody gave a shit, people wouldn’t have bothered to watch the announcement, wouldn’t have felt disappointment, and wouldn’t have gone and expressed their opinion online.
---
No, please stay and work together to make it better.
---
if it doesnt have a CM then none of the raiding community will invest in it, at all. Even teapot would come back to stream if they had CM for it, but they probably won't because some skewed metric that only management AND advertising get to have input on says otherwise. its becoming absolutely sickening, realizing how much love is put into this game by the devs who actually work on it compared to how absolutely little love is given to it by management AND advertising. It's like the devs are trying to save the game while management AND advertising are trying to kill it. absolutely sickening.
---
Well everything he says could be true, if they didn't have a big live announcement with a fucking timer for two days. Nobody forced them.
---
Well it’s kind off MikeZs job now, why the fuck would he show up
---
&gt; No amount of money can convince a person or company or organization to do something they’re not inclined to do.
---
Wait, what? Corporations exist to make money. That is their sole purpose.
---
The insult is that Anet thinks a new armor set is pvp content....
---
If you dont like it, then leave.
---
I think that first scene is the Drakkar lake zone from GW1.
---
I agree with the sentiment, but then they should SAY "not enough content" instead of "not content".
---
Yes... the two factions famous for being misogynistic, to the point that a shunned female ended up toppling them in gw1, are all dudes....
---
I recognized none of these dev's,  i doubt any of them played gw1....
---
You know, you have a serious point there.
---
No, I'm not going to be "grateful" that a product I paid for is underwhelming (seriously, wtf?). I'm not outraged either, for that matter. I'm just disinterested at this point.
---
Who cares?
---
Shit, that comparison just reminds how disappointing my childhood was. Maybe having low expectations helps lol
---
Perhaps they shouldn't try to oversell it for more than it is then. This entire ev3nt was completely pointless. A blogpost and a trailer would have been completely sufficient to show this. But that's not giving any perspective either, from how it looks like right now the game simply does not have a future ahead of it.
---
Probably should have googled more thoroughly, thank you!
---
Exactly thanks for explaining it all in more depth than I did. I tried on discord but meh.
---
"Soon" for ArenaNet is 2 years.
---
There's nothing like showing off some Funko Pops to prove that the team hasn't "missed a beat" "(at least in a player facing way)". /s
---
The word of mouth will destroy them with new players. If you've played a lot of mmos you'll see a familiar shift.
---
Sunk cost fallacy. I hope you're doing other stuff besides Guild Wars 2 PvP.
---
its ALMOST on the TABLE.
---
&gt; Maybe in Episode 3 of LS4 they could've shortened the collection for Petey and spent that time making a quality multiplayer version of the Joko instance.
---
TBF, I expect Strikes are going to be released for past encounters too. They admitted during the presentation that there are story encounters that players play once and never again, and those are good candidates for Strikes.
---
It's the casual dressup crowd that anet cares about because they are whales.  It's why Sub is the superior model because the ONLY way to make more money is to get new players AND keep vets.
---
Hype baby! No more desert.
---
fuck yeah I'm excited to go play classic WoW now.
---
The idea of stepping stone is to funnel more people into raid content, increasing its player size and thus allowing more resources to be spend on it. 
---
ImO its a try to fix what really is the problem of raids - harsh entry for people that dont know how to start.
---
Which changes nothing if the gameplay is outright non fun and borring.
---
Also you should read past my first sentence... or work on your reading comprehension.
---
because i was talking about the GAMEPLAY, and that A-net should deliver more NON OPEN WORLD content (fractals,raids or for example these strike stuff they anounced which is a first step in the right direction) which is definitly non 1 spamfest content.
---
I would be sad because it's a game that I enjoy. But it is just a game so I'll eventually move on.
---
Because raids have the concept of being hard no matter if you add a "story faceroll mode" to them. Raid word is the issue.
---
Bounties were a fail.
---
How do you fix that? Do both and call them something different. Faceroll easy, no rewards = that thing they announced
---
I watched this while afking sand crabs.  67 mage,  my osrs account is relatively new so I'm happy with the progress
---
Because he knew they didn’t have anything to present.
---
Why would I give money to a company that does not support the game modes I play?
---
Amen!
---
Yeah the issue isn't Anet, because i felt like they were uncomfortable being on stage, Mike Z sweating... the issue is the marketing and I knew that seeing Mike S would be... Ncsofty... Marketing Team organized this whole showcase... and the company that stands behind the marketing is... NCSoft...
---
Capes confirmed
---
I know I’m just saying it wasn’t as big as HoT because it’s just a new season, I’m not saying they were right to create an entire event for one small season
---
Hey bitch, just wanted to remind you about my post.
---
What they said in a forum post : 
---
&gt; Special Tournaments
---
&gt;
---
&gt; At this point, we’re holding off on the return of special tournament formats (2v2, 3v3, Tournament of Legends), until after swiss tournaments are complete. But now that some other bugs have been resolved, we’re hoping to get these going on a more regularly cadence.
---
But yeah it will give a cool fresh vibe. And if we can get even 5v5, festival activities or other things it's cool. But then after we will demand to have it all the time in unranked cause yeah 2 weeks every 2 months isn't really enough for alternate content.
---
&gt;I'm not the most dedicated or hardcore player in the world by any means, and I don't play the game as often as I probably should, 
---
Say no more, this game is just for you.
---
Funnily enough, I would argue that deciding to cater primarily to the more casual population is precisely part of what is killing the game. Casuals are a sizeable chunk of the game's population, but they are not what drives the game forward, in my opinion. Group content like dungeons and fractals, higher end PvE like fractal CMs and raids, \*proper\* support for WvW and PvP and competition is what creates hype. Not yet another living story which provides a couple of hours of content every couple of months. 
---
I do not in any way mean to be disparaging towards casual players. They are a vital chunk of an MMO's population, and Anet must, of course, cater to them. Their mistake is catering \*solely\* towards them, because it doesn't create content which drives the game forward to new levels, only keeps it afloat.
---
First of all thank you to all the devs who walked onto the stage today, it takes courage to expose yourself to the community and I warmly appreciate that you did it!
---
Unfortunately, I was, like many others, expecting sth along the lines of "this is our long-term plan for the game and its individual modes". Don't get me wrong, I love open world, the story and do enjoy living world maps a lot but a large part of my game time is spent in fractals and raids and for that I just have no clue what is coming. I'd love it if we could get details on that.
---
Wow... just... wow.
---
Yes.
---
Thanks, just did :)
---
I was concerned when WP ONLY talked story.  I thought oh GOD they haven't learned have they.  Watched the announcement... strike missions and a world boss are intriguing but that's it?  Release that beautiful trailer they played at the beginning then make a separate gameplay trailer (like 3 minutes long or something) and say prologue sept 17th and i think people would be moderately hyped.
---
&gt; this is the level of hype and reach that we need to attract new **and returning players**
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Honestly think this is a brilliant move. I also think mini pets for these funkos would be pretty awesome.  
---
Never been a big fan but it sounds like a pretty good idea for them to go for.  
---
I'm intrigued how far the go with having real life merch go ingame
---
It's pretty much the industry standard sub fee. And I believe you can play both modern and classic for the same sub
---
Well, it is more accessible, that's for sure.
---
There are pros and cons
---
When these posts come up I just assume OP has never bought any gems and then I have to laugh at them essentially telling the people who are buying gems to stop complaining.
---
FFXIV Trials have Normal (for casual and story purposes) and Extreme Difficulties. If Anet is trying to copy that let's hope they copy that too.
---
You realize that anet trying to wind the game down in secret is why everyone’s been so upset, right?
---
I think you should be able, as a company, to point to a general release window for your projects
---
&gt;Too bad that's it's not hard mode. It's normal mode for a raid content. Which by nature is meant to be something harder than normal/base content.
---
Semantics. It's harder than the rest of the game, it would be harder than easy mode. It is hard mode. 
---
&gt;You're just making it sound like they're forcing Dhuum's CM down your throat at every encounter.
---
No.
---
But the raids *are* required to get Envoy Armor. 
---
Currently. 
---
&gt;And again no. They can't give you the same rewards that a "normal" raider gets. It would throw away the whole point of difficulty and effort that was put into clearing them.
---
So? 
---
For one thing, the raids have already been out for years now. They just decided to give away HoT to anyone with PoF, by the same token, there's no reason they can't give HoT raid rewards to anyone who does the easy mode versions of the raids. 
---
Second, I don't think they need to give the same *amount* of rewards per completion, someone who clears easy mode raids ten times might not get *as much* stuff as someone who completes hard mode raids ten times, but they should get the same *type* of  stuff, so that someone who completes easy mode twenty times or fifty times would end up with the same stuff as someone who completed hard mode ten times. 
---
The point is, they should never have to *leave* easy mode to get the cool rewards they want.
---
If you want to clear your special snowflake version of the boss, good and could partially agree if gw2 didn't need much more focus on more content and so on and thus had a a part of "free devs" for them to work on these difficult raids you guys seems to like, but getting the same rewards that I and any other non-raiders out there want to get is completely non-negotiable.
---
Obligatory: Give me your account to collect daily rewards, please.
---
The next season is supposed to take place on a single evolving and expanding map. I think that'll do wonders for immersion and investment.
---
&gt; Charr females used to stay away from the battlefield
---
That part kinda feels like they just didn't want to bother differentiating female charr models back in GW1, and this is how they retroactively tried to explain it within the lore :P
---
I'm rooting for 2069 at this point.
---
yeah, i think that too. Haters took the subreddit and is basically a witch hunt now, if you have something positive to say, you will be downvoted called anet sucker, employe, white knight, etc
---
Just take in mind that this subreddit only represent a 2-5% of the game. And psicology speaking, is pretty normal that angry people want to show other that they are angry, meanwhile happy people don´t.
---
"we chose to include Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns free with all Guild Wars 2: Path of Fire purchases from now on.
---
If you already own Guild Wars 2: Path of Fire but didn’t purchase Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns, both expansions will be available on your account within twenty-four hours of the announcement."
---
It sounds like it should work, but I don't know for sure.
---
I enjoy the voice actor, and it would be nice to have a dragon with some personality for a change. But from just the trailer it seems like the same dragon story all over agin but now in ice flavor.
---
And it wouldn't have been "intoxicated" with the overall disappointment about the announcement.
---
Yea i saw the vod was an hour and 45 (ish, don't quote me)  and thought huh... that's kinda short but not bad.  Then i saw they did 10 minutes of nothing at the beginning... ok, stupid but most streams do it.  Then i saw a 30 minute (i think)  timer in the bottom and thought wait.... this whole thing is going to be 45 minutes? That's like no time... then they spent the last 10 minutes plugging merch.... Anet, either explain why everything's shit so we can adjust our expectations or get on reddit and open your Damn eyes.
---
Imagine you take a flight to hear this "(WvW) we'll talk about it in the coming months" xD
---
What expansion?
---
Granny voice is hot? I mean... I'm not in a position to kinkshame anyone but... is this really something you want people to know about you?
---
I think everyone seems to agree that the state of the genre and mmos in general is pretty terrible right now apart from a select few. Im pretty sure a few new mmos are being released between now and the following year. Cannot remember any specific titles but definitely remember seeing some listed somewhere. Can anyone confirm? Or post links to new upcoming mmos that might be worthy of some attention?
---
Yes it will.  They no longer sell heart of Thorns on it's own so ANY purchase of PoF give automatically HoT.
---
I bought from Dlgamer, since they are an officail retailler anyways, and the 20$ PoF gave me instantly HoT too.
---
I also imagine we will head towards Sacnoth Valley where the burning fest was too.  
---
As they have updated Grothmaws name to include valley
---
Gold
---
No, it's just comical that someone made the executive decision to put what ArenaNet just revealed on live stage and hype it up as some huge pivot point for the game, when it was really just another LW release trailer.
---
Yeah, they can't be silent and they also can't put on a live show that only dedicated players will show up to and then not cater to veteran players. It's their job to market the game and to produce content and the little venn diagram area where the two of those meet is also their job, and they failed spectacularly at it today.
---
God damn i love warframe too and have spent way too much money on platinum and LOVED their latest community event announcements. I've spent quite a bit in gems myself, but it hurts when I don't know what to expect for the future and I'm scared to spend more on a "dead game" as many have put it.

You a new player, or a player who's dabbled with casual/F2P content? You just heard that you can buy *the complete game*, both expansions, for a mere $30. You just heard that there's an awesome new story coming up where you get to fight a terrifying ice dragon. You just heard that there's an easier path to get into raiding and other end-game content. You just got build templates without needing a third-party add-on. You heard about updates to other game modes, and those updates will maybe even be live by the time you're experienced enough to try them.
---
GW2 has two big content release methods, expansions (paid for, bring big changes to the game all at once, done every few years) and living world seasons (released more regularly at about 3 ish months, unlocked if you just play during those 3 months, less content per patch)
---
Today, they had this big conference right outside of PAX West to announce the newest season, but really only as a teaser for the newest season.
---
Now, there are two groups of people who were bothered by this today
---
1) the more hardcore community in the game, who were disappointed to see that we're not really getting anything substantially new announced with this new season. 
---
2) the people, both casual and hardcore, that realized that a 45 minute live conference with audience attendance should actually have enough content to warrant being 45 minutes long. All they had to say ended up being summarized in a blog post which took maybe a minute or two to read
---
Both groups were left with a feeling of "wait...that's it?, but for slightly different (although connected) reasons.
---
You will be back.
---
They always come back.
---
This is not how it works. If ANet wants to make money, they need to release content players enjoy—not the other way around where players spend money to encourage ANet to make good content.
---
In fact, spending money on the game when you’re disappointed in it only encourages the game to continue to proceed in the direction it’s going.
---
This. We are not conmen
---
You remember when this was actually a selling point of the game? No more stupid fetch quests, no more go there and talk to this guy quests.
---
Guardian's best weapon tends to include scepter.
---
You'll absolutely hate it, trust me.
---
Your best bet is probably Warrior or GS Reaper.
---
I believe that every company should be bashed into the bloody mess for the "business talk" like that. Deception, lies and political bullshit should not ever be the norm under any circumstance. I am amazed at how the press and the community let everyone off the hook so easily.
---
I can too. XD
---
That's ridiculous, we don't pay Arenanet to overcome their self inflicted wounds, we pay them for a fun game to play. They failed to deliver any kind of excitement for things to come.
---
We can confirm two things.  
---
Sith lord marketing team  
---
We don't need our phones.
---
Public speaking isn't for everyone, he could not remember all the things he had to talk about, and he had to hurry because the marketing from NCsoft were stepping on his heels
---
Isn't the point of the "baby raids" to let casuals get a taste of normal raiding BEFORE the normal raiding? The "hard mode" ARE the normal raids.
---
Your opinion i find it plenty fun, apparently more people do too since FF14 is much more successful than gw2. Dude youre talking about EZ mode raids, if they are making content thats even easier than wings 1,4,7 then thats a clear sign they are going to make something that is essentially unfailable to anyone that knows how to dodge without clicking their endurance bar
---

---
&gt;Joined
---
well said.
---
Deleting criticism is the first sign that they live in a bubble.  They refuse to listen.  ERP showed that people WANT to love the hardcore part of the game but they just ignore it.
---
Yeah, unfortunately people are expecting the underwater expansion, it feels like, but they're just not ready to give it to us apparently, whether it's for story or mechanics reasons.
---
Yes please! It's sad that my two out three of my favorite genres (MMOs and racing games) are both in a bad state.
---
Stop breathin' or it will fall off!
---
The not at 22:16 has these runes on his belt which look so similar to the ones that existed in deep stone fractal. Wonder if that means something or this is the case of art being repeated
---
Eh, just a big fan of the game sick of all the negativity going around the subreddit right now.
---
&gt;Anet just has to think of a story
---
Gonna take a while then.
---
Even if it is, it doesn't change the fact that Anet has alienated essentially every section of their playerbase that isn't focused on living story. That's why people are mad. Anet has mostly abandoned every other type of content, giving just enough to not actually kill the modes.
---
nice
---
Don't know about sustained. Do these 1 players even spend?
---
Nice
---
Secret Worlds Legend would like to have a word about this.
---
Wait,  yea, they did say that.  If they charge for this shit, no one buy it. EXPANSIONS are barely worth the box price.
---
People will understand if you explain. Show respect to your customers, and they will show respect back.
---
This.  It's not the format, but the content that is the issue.
---
If we literally got *everything* that normally released with an expac, just split into 6 pieces and delivered every 8-12 weeks, most of us would be very happy.
---
I honestly believe had they announced Elite Specs were coming with Season 5 the reaction would've been *completely* different.
---
Hopefully Anet can find the right cadence now that they have some distance from the layoffs/restructuring, but getting players to warm up to Living Story Only will be tough.
---
Next Raid then?
---
A customer is usually taken more seriously and gets more results with less embarrassment or retaliation if they share concerns directly with whatever company they are a customer of. That company should also appreciate it more, because they can use the feedback without losing pre-biased customers. This "community" is potentially doing more harm than good...
---
Woo, more blaming the players instead of the developers who do little-to-nothing to fix the issues of the game.
---
cries in wildstar
---
After listening to the german and the french version I am 99% sure its a female voice. But maybe my brain just wants it to be a female voice because that would make the son of svanir mad AF :P
---
Swtor releases an xpac soon
---
its a bit androgynous, imo with that voice jormag could either be male or female
---
Almost every constructive way to discuss problems has been used a lot over the years and NOTHING had been done.
---
I'm not gonna come back in two years. Unless they suprise me before my guild dies, this will be the end.
---
Gotta make compromises. 
---
Like I came to terms with the fact that FF combat is vastly inferior to gw2, the fact that the aesthetics are generic for an Asian mmo, the fact that quests unfortunately take a huge chunk of time, the fact that there's somewhat of a gear grind, and the mere fact that it's a sub game.
---
Taking into account all these pros and cons, I also look for good endgame content, something SE actually pays attention to. Anet fails spectacularly in this area so switching is a no brainier. I'm fine with all of the cons that FF has, as long as there's content to enjoy.
---
If one actually followed through on the things they say, some might be more apt to believe them instead of trying to read between the lines and sift the actual truth from the corporatespeak. 
---
But there is a lot of truth to your statement, The community seems more likely to kill the game than the developers, but there is fault on both sides.
---
Nex xpac coming out,  operations are pretty good.  World content has improved.  It's pretty fun.
---
This is the most agreeable post.
---
That plot is for gw3
---
I’ll like strike missions if they fulfill a few criteria:
---
-They don’t detract from current raid releases.
---
-They’re worthwhile enough reward-wise to complete on a regular basis without overstepping the rewards that raids provide.
---
-They’re easy enough to complete but aren’t faceroll easy. 
---
If they can do this, they get a thumbs up from me. Easier 10 man content that’s still engaging and rewarding (assuming it doesn’t infringe on other content releases) will always be a positive imo.
---
This, and I agree in a way. I was excited to see if we were going after "bubbles" or Jormag next, but eitherway I wasn't going to be personally disappointed. We'll come for "bubbles" soon enough.
---
I can understand the disappointment, though. A lot of people play this game for Raids, dungeons, WvW, and other things that don't seem to be getting new content. Though, you never know, maybe we'll see some of that content in the new zones introduced with the LW this season!
---
I thought he was reffering to the human male line in summoning a minion my bad.
---
Well we could just bitch about without offering solutions with just the expectation that they read our minds or we could actually offer advice and find out as a community to tell them how we want want communication to happen from them. I guess you'd rather bitch and throw a fit like the spoiled, entitled bitch child you are instead.
---
still better than eso
---
I don't think so.
---
The map is way too big, and feel way too boring without something such as a mount to look after, it is just too brutal to me, I'm pretty sure I'm not the only newbie being driven off of by this.
---
Uh oh.  Here come the GW2 doujins.
---
I thought he was referring to the human summoning voice line my bad
---
Thx
---
LF a new home, I feel homeless now, problem is there are no truly good games out there right now that can compare to gw2, my only hope is Blue Protocol but who knows when and if we even gonna get a western release, and NO FF14 is a pile of shit, I don't care how many idiots play that archaic bullshit excuse of a game !!! shit is still shit. (I did try it, it was garbage)
---
Imagine being a player base putting up with years of " it's on the table" or "we'll talk about that in later months" or "legendary armor and backpacks as a selling point for HoT and getting them a year later". 
---
We have every right to be disappointed with a 45 minute presentation that had so much focused time on merchandise and slapping the PvP community and WvW communities in the face.
---
Honestly, I think they just wanted us to know they still care about the game. The cinematic trailer was better than the path of fire trailer
---
Even the host knows that they do not care about this game mode
---
Woot! My alt account will no longer go splat because I forget it doesn't have gliding xD
---
I was really cheering for Mike Z too.  I thought a veteran of the company coming in to take the reigns was going to be fresh and new.  It’s just been more of the same.  The devs are just doing what they are told to do.  It’s the higher ups who don’t seem to care about looking around and seeing what the community wants.  “Oh you guys want WvW updates or new raids?  Hmmm how about build templates you asked for 6 years ago and more living story?  We’ve got a great idea regarding Rytlock’s cubs that I think you’ll love!”
---
Realistically if they had advertised this as "join us as we kick off the new season of Living World!" there would be a *ton* less vitriol. They made it sound like they had some new giant secret to unveil and they just didn't.
---
Being secretive about the content of this event bit them in the butt hard.
---
I read your post in the same voice as Child-Picard when he demanded to see his "father" during a Ferengi hostage situation.
---
I loved HoT content. PoF I only kind of liked.
---
Now, Icy / Tundra zones are my favorite just a very close second from Jungle, the colder the better. Third would be fire, in case you were curious, haha.
---
It was a flippant example, not a strawman. A strawman is a mischaracterization of an argument to make one side weaker. One game was confirmed to be a mobile game referencing GW2 (which honestly, I'm incredibly glad it got canned because it looked like the cartoony throwaway crap I expect from mobile titles, not anything interesting) but we don't know what any other projects were and hey, Hearthstone's a dumb mobile game. For babies.
---
My point is that there is no practical difference between Blizzard and ANet. Obviously one has money and power, etc. But ANet wasn't the only company to lay off game developers back in early 2019. ALL of these big names in game development are subject to the same rules. Blizzard could probably fuck up MORE than ANet can and still be fine, but all these companies take risks. My point was that people don't care if blizzard made Hearthstone because Hearthstone released. Of COURSE ANet's decision looks stupid because it didn't pan out. What if they did release that dumb mobile game and we're both idiots who couldn't see the genius of it? What if ANet's mobile game revolutionizes mobile games in the same way GW2 revolutionized MMOs? What if they took that "no grind" philosophy and applied it to, say, card games? I don't know how, but imagine that. They release that and it's an amazing success. Do we cry about them taking dev time off GW2 to work on that? Fuck no! We commend them for broadening their scope and finally getting another game out there to keep themselvs solvent. People only aren't doing that now because the gamble didn't pay off.
---
All they have to do is open a public beta server with wip build templates or announce the hopeful fiscal quarter for various desired updates. That would have been event worthy.
---
Which is fine for me :))
---
When you rent out an entire theater at a big gaming event and then have a 48 hour countdown after announcing it a month in advance, you're doing it for the exact hope of building up hype.
---
They did.
---
And then they fell on their ass.
---
What did I miss? Seems to be a lot of blow back on A net and I’m out of the loop
---
Imagine actually being there in person for that annoucement, holy shit
---
&gt; That is only needed for expansion level or equivilent content
---
This is why I'm frustrated. They went above and beyond a "normal LS announcement". Once you raise the stakes you have to know your audience will expect something huge. If it was a normal stream in their office then we would've known what to expect.
---
What are you talking about. Personally I haven't spend a dime since PoF, just didn't feel worth it.
---
They did clarify on the forums that "mini-seasons" would likely be variants like 2v2 and 3v3, etc.
---
I found the end weird, i think they should have put it between the recap from Mike Z and the final Saga announcement, that way would make more sense I think.
---
Phantasy Star Online 2 is releasing in the west in spring of 2020...
---
Amazon is working on a LotR mmo (no release date).
---
Camelot Unchained is coming out soon (I think a spiritual successor to Dark Age of Camelot? Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on this).
---
More upcoming projects that seem cool are Blue Protocol and Project BBQ. I think Ashes of Creation is supposed to get a Battle Royale game and a full mmo.
---
Those are all I've got on my radar currently, but there are WAY more that are being worked on that might appeal to you more than they have to me! :)
---
Nintendo comes to mind too. 
---
Nintendo: Metroid Prime 4 was looking like it might suck, so we delayed it so in won't. 
---
Everyone: Oh... yeah, that's probably for the best.
---
This wouldn't be the case if the reveal was good, but it wasn't, don't blame the community, arenannet knew damn well what to expect.
---
I feel that's misrepresenting it a fair bit.
---
I've not seen many people who said that what was shown was **bad**. *Disappointment* creeps in from the fact that this was done via a build-up and an actual meet-up. Suggesting something bigger than it turned out to be.
---
Now, even more so than without the previous lay-offs, wouldn't a company already struggling to get back on its feet **not** want to spend extra money **and** time (therefor stressing the remaining workers) organizing something they **know** will just disappoint the players?  
---
All they've shown/said a blog post + a video could have presented exactly as well, and they could have saved themselves a lot of money in the process and a few people could have gone home earlier.
---
None... yet :P  
---
Note: I do not expect any gems or hope to get any.
---
For me it's been wanting more Charr focus. So visiting the homelands will be great
---
builds are made by ners who like to theorycraft, hardcore players play too much to be able to calculate.
---
Nice spot. I took her for a Commander as well.
---
Female Commander x Jormag confirmed
---
"Free" stuff is just selling stuff at a 100% discount, which would still be flagged if the item in question is illegal to sell or highly regulated. I'm not in the same line of work as ANet, but we do sell products for "free" to customers along with an unofficial agreement with them to buy other products. The "free" items are still treated as normal sales and are subject to all applicable regulations. Free isn't really free.
---
From what I heard some of the more senior devs decided to be let go to let newer talent stay there. You can argue if it was based on money but I heard multiple sources say this.
---
Thanks
---
lmao
---
Those mini seasons is all I ever wanted. Several funny game modes where you just jump in with some friend and have a good time for some rounds. Sure you could already do that in hotjoin but the mode is so flawed and the rewards so non exsistend that you find almost none actually playing it.
---
Conquest is fine. That balance is directed at conquest is fine. Having to play conquest for 7 years only is not fine. So I really hope this comes and is not canceled.
---
Reverse psychology works.
---
It makes utter sense to make a mobile game. Don't you guys have phones?
---
It was a sarcastic post which brings out some good points, I don't mind spending money, doesn't bother me a bit if content is "good" or reasonable. In some content it's worth spending and some isn't.
---
Fun fact: this commander was made as one of Joko's lovers.  
---
This commander has no concept of dignity. Just like me.
---
This is the perfect description.
---
Tbh, when you account for the fact that we were constantly being let down for several months, a complete lack of communication from gw2 devs and a huge hype creation around 'hey, we have a trailer, one good one meh and one shit funkos, and a guy in a black poncho,' I'm suprised the backlash is this timid.
---
People who have put thought into their argument won't ever say that Living World isn't content. It's just that we feel two things: 1) LW content isn't appealing when you factor in the time spent, the variety, the difficult, and the release cadence. 2) LW has a enormously disproportionate amount of invested resources when compared to the other parts of content. 
---
While it was never going to happen, this is what the gaming community wanted to hear. "Hello everyone, we've recognized that PoF and LS4 were mainly focused on living world story content and open world gameplay features. Therefore, for the next saga, we will attempt to even the distribution when compared to our other game modes. This will result in 2 out of our 4 content teams being repurposed to work on raids, fractals, pvp, wvw, legendaries, elite specs, balance, new features entirely, etc. This means roughly a 1000% increase in the resource budget of those teams." And then go into the details of each area...This is what people were looking for, but it was never going to happen.
---
I think they're layering a more feminine voice (though definitely in the androgynous range) on top of a dark, whispery classic-dragon voice underneath. During certain moments, you can hear the voices kind of merge and sound more corrupted together. It's honestly a really unique approach.
---
&gt; but as long as support and development continue for a game 
---
That's the whole point. This game made the (good or bad) decision to split their playerbase. PvP and WvW players have received 0 content for more than 2 years now. Those game modes are bleeding player because there is nothing to keep them engaged. In turn more people leave because they have no one to play with. Those game modes aren't supported by Anet right now.
---
&gt;the devs have still given us plenty of fresh material and innovation, like the mount system
---
I understand if people in this game like to run around and tag events. For them this announcement was all they wanted. But you can't say "us". There is not one demographic that plays this game. 
---
As someone who raids, fractals, plays pvp and WvW it's hard for me to optimistic. My raid static just quit because they see no reason to play. The delay between raid wings has only increased. 
---
Fractals haven't gotten challenge motes since Nightmare in 2016.
---
The PvP queues are getting longer and longer. You always see the same people in your games since the player base is now so small.
---
WvW has been ignored for more than 2 years now. The new alliance system was being talked about 3 years ago now. They can't keep saying "we'll talk more about it in a few months" forever.
---
So you may be grateful that you get a new story episode every 4 months. But for those of us who do endgame, this announcement was nothing short of a huge disappointment.
---
Exactly, it's literally the only thing they needed to do to calm the waters for a few months. Show some elite specializations, or show concept art or give some hints if they weren't ready yet.
---
Instead we got some vistas. This is a game, not a fucking art gallery. Get your priorities right, god damn it.
---
*Buys up all Frostfang from the TP the day before*
---
STONKS
---
(Just kidding, I'm fucking broke atm)
---
The announcement itself was fine but a lot of people want more content rather than LS. I for one would be okay if they skipped LS every other patch if it meant we got a lot of good/fun repeatable content.
---
They are. Doesn't stop the community from turning on them at times as well.
---
There's a lot of overlap between gw2 and warframe players. Kinda used to a nice community turning on itself when dissatisfied tbh. Just wish there were less people who want to kick a good game like gw2 when it's down.
---
Honestly I doubt anyone came out to PAX *just* for GW2.
---
Future plans for competitive game modes sound very promising. This should have really went into the announcemet. Can't get wait to have these additons.
---
I see this argument a lot and I just dont' get the logic of it. If you are ANet and you are NEVER going to do raids again... why would you develop a system for easier raid-style encounters to get new players more comfortable with the idea of ten-man content? Like, why make a tutorial for something you plan on never making again? Strike missions, to me, are the strongest signal that they're even more dedicated to raids in the future! In fact I'd think that, with strikes in place, they would feel more free to make REALLY brutal raids in the future! Because they know their playerbase has a baseline understanding from strike missions.
---
In addition to this, the new content format means that they could add these strikes to core Tyria maps so new players get a feel for this content as well. Imagine fighting Lupi in Orr again as a Strike mission. With all his shit brought up to 2019 standards!
---
I’m BG since beta, and you’re right. We were open for almost two days and everyone and their brother transferred over. But we didn’t get any new Guilds. 
---
So we have tons of pugs but not many guilds, and a dearth of Commanders.  We’re all hoping that we don’t get a link this time. Honestly, fighting for second is more fun than a sure win every week.
---
they actually announced pretty big palette of big stuff...
---
yet people expect to get big package once in 2 years instead of them releasing it whenever it is ready in small packages 10x more often than expansions are...
---
Yeah, that would make sense. Seems a stupid way to run a business though. Expansion 3 looks even more unlikely due to the lay-offs, which ironically, we're most likely caused by anets bad business model.
---
Plus they mentioned bringing HoT masteries to IBS. This neatly solves the issue there, letting everyone be able to learn the masteries and use then even if they previously skipped HoT
---
Warframe just got another tiny content update, with a big game changing expansion just around the corner, FF14 has one of the best expansions ever made. (yes it's a drag to get there) but it has so much content that you'll drown in it, wow classic is actual hype, even if people will only play it for a few months, thats slill hundreds of hours, monster hunter expansion soon, borderlands 3 soon, A LOT of indie games that are actually good are getting released, also torchlight mmo!
---
Internal problems of a company are not the customers' problem. A team only deserves kudos for meeting the customers' expectations... not for surviving the company's internal bullshit.
---
They needed an event to hide the ads of the stuff they were trying to sell everyone like the dark horse comics and the merch. "Buy this stuff, I'm pretty sure this stuff was YOUR idea, IT WAS, WASN'T IT. GIVE US MONEY." I mean, wow how did anyone not notice.
---
This is exactly how I feel. I would enjoy collections/quests if they actually had good gameplay/systems/story attached to them like an actual RPG.
---
I feel like I'd be the fitest and most handsome tosser in that hall. And I'm usually not an egoistic prick.
---
Current bag level is 24-30, fyi.
---
&gt;insanely high sub fee
---
Where the fuck do you live that 15$ is "insanely high"?
---
I mean, I dont like sub fees either, but your statement here is a bit silly.
---
&gt;lists all of the awesome content they announced
---
&gt;i CaN't BeLiEvE i LeT mYsElF gEt ExCiTeD fOr ThIs

It doesn't take 'everything'.  It takes noticing that most mobs overlap and you'll approach them the same way.  Once you realize that the enemies use copy-paste moves, the game becomes *incredibly* repetitive.  PoF was a breath of fresh air because hydras completely shifted the way you engage open-world content, and made everything feel fresher and more engaging.  I wish there was more of that!  I wish centaurs trampled you and enemy charr used formations.  That once you get far enough north, Norn would attack you out of nowhere and that Asura could teleport in reinforcements.  I wish the undead inflicted disease and an attack from one increased your detection range to other undead near you, so they'd home in on you en masse instead of stacking slow effects.  I wish some Mordrem could terraform the world under their feet as a semi-persistent effect (like 2 minutes) to give them advantages in combat.  Hell, I wish enemies could use fortifications correctly, that the game had a height advantage system for ranged combat, and that Largos and Norn could take hits out on you as a bounty system.  
---
It would be *really cool* if there was some mechanical diversity to the game but generally speaking, outside of raids it just isn't there.  We fight the class reskins, the wurms, the generic smashy "beasts", and fliers.  Ocassionally Anet steps out of the box and we get pocket raptors, mordrem snipers, and hydras.  And yeah, they're annoying but at least it's *different*.     
---
It's just a shame because the combat's fantastic and I really wish they'd expand on that instead of building up another elder dragon.
---
Exactly, it's not like what they showed was bad. No not at all, what they showed was cool and interesting, but... that was it. Nothing else. They a few interesting things, then we got a sith lord trying to sell IRL minis
---
Yes
---
&gt;Go to their subreddit's and I'm sure you'd find the exact same attitude towards those games.
---
I didn't know that FFXIV had become a cesspit of toxicity and vitriol to match GW2s. Guess I should go dig deeper past the cute cat girl art.
---
Fair point. I haven't been around long enough to know of the other living world announcements, but a studio announcement seems overkill for that. Especially since, as you mention there was little given.
---
WvW, PvP, raids, fractals? Where was stuff taht we didn't already know was coming?
---
The Core game wasn't designed around mounts. You need to utilize your skills and the Swiftness Boon.
---
Warrior would use the Warnhorn 4, Greatsword 3, Bulls' Charge, and Balanced Stance.
---
Elementalist would use Lightning Flash and various Air skills.
---
"potential" means we might see one thing from either list by 2020 if we buy enough gemstore content to please management / advertising. The post-HoT behavior of management in this game in EVERY SINGLE situation other than the firing of JP and the handling of the layoffs has been absolutely disgusting and sickening to my core. Its time to give the amazing devs some people who can actually fucking manage the incredible potential of this game, because this aint it
---
&gt; Why are game companies allowed to get away with shit that no other industry is given slack with?
---
Because we let them, that's why. Fanboys and shills make sure to apply group pressure as well, so the others fall in line. This stupid trend has led gaming to the garbage can during the last decade.
