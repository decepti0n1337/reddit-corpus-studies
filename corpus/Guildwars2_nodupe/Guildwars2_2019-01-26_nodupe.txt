I liked it. While I'm a fan of Marjory, it's important to continue their stories as people, not only as a couple. We got to spend time with Kasmeer's Kasmeer, not just Marjory's Kasmeer.

It took me about a year after HoTs release to commit to mapping the maps. To be honest, I learned the most RUNNING hp trains. People are eager to correct you if they know a more efficient route and you learn a lot as you go. But yeah, tag along on one or two and then try to run one yourself!

I've just replayed the "Act with wisdom but Act" Sylvari storyline recently and it's pretty obvious that Carys and Tegwen are a couple. Honestly, go play through the story yourself as Sylvari. It's a level 20 quest. 
---
Firstly, I doubt they're going to connect raid story and personal story that intricately after all the hub bub that Forsaken Thicket got, and that was barely relevant. So if Dhuum's story ever gets continued, it'd likely be in raids or fractals - the former as a continuation, the later as a prelude. But again, I don't see them continuing it with raids, otherwise that's what w6 would have been.
---
But onto those two specific situations: I wouldn't be surprised if she already can drain him given she modified the ritual to reinforce Dhuum's prison with the power of the Reapers. And Grenth is so far beyond Tyria that I doubt he'd be paying attention to its ongoings anymore. Even Kormir's gone now.
---
It just feels far too strongly like Anet just wanted to wrap up the Dhuum plot and did it in a rushed, haphazard way that was truly unfitting the anticipation for returning to the Underworld and Dhuum.
---
IIRC, Linsey said they were more barebones than the D'Alessio map, which was pretty barebones. So I doubt there would have been anything to really see.
---
Yeah had it on a asura guy in cof. Thought ot was just a super rare bug
---
Thanks! I'll record some gameplay of general open world PvE and instanced content (dungeons/tier 1 fractals) this weekend.

ESO: Does a kegstand

You’ve got some work ahead of you. Make sure you get the daily Machete from the HoT converter (forgetting the name right now), and start doing some dailies in WvW (land claimer, big spender, and master of monuments are super easy). You’ll get reward track potions, and within a few weeks you’ll have the Gift of Battle. Machetes are a pain, as you don’t get enough in the actual meta, and will need to run DS 3-5 times to get enough crystalline ore. 
---
Honestly, this is one of the reasons I love the sylvari so much. They are one of the few good representations of asexuality in modern media. They have gender, but lack the capabilities to have sex. Even so, they are still romantically attracted to others. Usually, when media tries to represent asexual characters, they always make the character lack both sexual and romantic attraction, and that is far from the truth for many (if not most) asexuals. 
---
When the community was going back and forth about what sylvari should look and act like on the gw2guru, there was a lot of thought put into how and why plants would have a gender at all and many people settled on the idea that all sylvari would be asexual, but take on the appearance of gendered humans because they were stealing from the human template. I am really, really glad this made it into the game.
---
For reference, I cannot seem to find the old Anet post with discussion on this, but the wiki backs me up here: 
---
&gt; Sylvari gender is selected by the Pale Tree prior to each individual's emergence, and is distinguished by the same general features as human genders, although they lack reproductive capabilities... Romance is practiced among the sylvari, disregarding gender between those involved.

Thank you for clearing it up! I only store materials on my “mule” because the mats bank is full - for example I have 12 elderwood stacks (250) sitting on my toon, with whom I plan to craft. 
---
Heart of Thorns story actually has replayability. I played it 18 times to get the full Leyline armor set + Chak weapons + Viper exotic armor set.
---
Frankly, ANet doesn't need to turn story instances into dungeon. Just give meaningful rewards in it. 
---
What PvE group content that is popular enough to be reliably done do you think is best for a player that enjoys the mobile action combat aspects (Such as using lightning flash when knocked down to avoid a followup attack) more than min/maxing builds and rotations for efficiency?  
---
I've been struggling with the endgame since content like Fractals don't usually play how it feels should be intended, Raids seem too min/max heavy for hardcore players, and I was struggling to find map event metas that reliably had groups for them (Even if you need to use the Event Timer) or weren't being somewhat cheesed (Like the RIBA train in SW).  I did find playing a combat medic type character to be a lot of fun in Dragon Stand however.
---
Nope that's it. Repeatable bad chest and one time AP.
---
It's actually quite normal to be casual about being a girl on the internet, or at least, it should be normal, and I'm sorry that you're so triggered by actual women existing.

Not if you use your own materials that you get passively from playing anyway.

DirectX 11 should be 10 years old. So if people buy cheap, i would guess 8+ year old Hardware?

Monk runes don't suck.
---
That's like asking if GW2 will ever be set up for proper raiding! Probably but only in parts, and there'll still be missing bits.
---
What's the point of this "award"? To celebrate further degeneration of mankind? 
---
Technically theres this npc that canonically does the raids, hes at bloodstone fen, and also in the latest episode too. Story wise him and his group are the ones that clear the raids.
---
Can't wait to see who buys a win this time around.
---
The last time somone tipped me I returned it. I just finished my jp as normal and threw down a port as I was leaving for anyone who passed by.
---
Now do this as a max size charr. JP are always an experience when you cant see your own hitboxes.
---
know what that i agree, but the amount of time to get full set with monk runes you spend the same amount of time to get fractal relics for a piece ascended armor
---
They could make new ones instead of crappy fractals like sirens reef/deepstone.
---
They don’t need the old code for new dungeons

I'm still saving for the ruby node, and I also have the bl expedition bringing 3-8 blood rubies per day.

The bigger tendrils when a weapon is stowed come from the WvW ascended chest.

Absolutely nothing, the person is talking out their ass. Blizzard had hinted years ago that Soldier could be gay, but because there was a stupid controversy (that had little to do with anything Blizzard did) that popped up a few days before Blizzard officially revealed the story that contained Soldier's reveal, people decided it was just a ploy to placate the "SJW" or whatever. 
---
Fractals. It sounds like you're basing all your knowledge of fractals on T4s, which do rely on min/maxing to reliably complete. T1s and T2s aren't as tough, and most PUGs can get away with just about any team composition.
---
What do you think fractals should like? That's what I wanna know.

I did it with primordium and wasted like 25 gold. I never keep &gt;50g on hand so I was really upset.
---
I have to preface by rephrasing these sorts of events are great within a large enough and healthy enough community because they inspire potential competitors with a reason to compete; that said, few to no viable competitors currently exist, rendering the endeavor sort of meaningless except as a spectacle for the small viewership the game draws.  
---
If the goal is to throw a bone to the handful of remaining teams and the riffraff of chaotic pugs clamoring for a free llama, then yeah, this'll do just that, but I think most sPvPers lament not a lack of rewards for playing but the game's dire need of new blood to better fill the ranks and smooth out the matchmaking and, by proxy, create better competition—and I fundamentally disagree with the notion that any game can be reinvigorated in this way through monetary rewards.  People only dedicate time to improving at something if they genuinely enjoy doing the thing in the first place.  You can't pay people to like something.  
---
We already see this methodology failing daily.  Plenty of players participate in seasons solely for the gold from the league chests and/or the sPvP reward tracks without giving a shit about the game mode, which I'm sure you've also had to suffer through, and I think you'd agree it's an awful experience on either team as it ruins the competition when 10% of the match has no investment in its outcome.  It sure does incentivize people to play, but it certainly doesn't make the scene any better.  
---
If people don't play something it's because they don't enjoy it.  To address that we (rather, Arenanet) need to understand why they don't and do something about it.  I don't know what the answer is because the mode is plagued by more than a few issues, but throwing gems and legendaries at it won't fix it.
---
CTRL+P, Print.
---
Guilds are super casual and largely set aside like PVP from the main feature development track. There were designs in the original launch for making PVP and Guilds a central focus of the game, but so much of the population didn't play within that design that both PVP and Guilds got immensely simplified and dumbed down, and post-HOT, are largely viewed with apathy in comparison to the PVE content that continues to attract and maintain the player base.
---
I see! you are right! Thank you
---
 Yet we still do, and I'd be lying if I said I hadn't gotten the theme song a fair few times because a boss 'expects' a time frame and I thought I could handle it.
---
It's bad management, can be avoided and should be tweaked about so it doesn't happen again - but few companies have an environment where this actually happens. 
---
Is this game even playable on a laptop?
---
I thought the most you could buy at a time is 250.
---
There's also my Elonian Mirage/[Primeval Dynasty Queen](https://imgur.com/4lQRomV) look, though I'm currently using it on a Necromancer, without the matching staff. @_@
---
I've only ever done T1 and T2.  Min/maxing frustration comes more from Raids and how Dungeons were before HoT.
---
As for how I think they should feel...  Well, let's look at the fractal where you fight that ice golem at the end by dumping lava on it.  You need to do that junk with the buttons to get doors open, but these pesky mole people keep spawning by them.  The intent seems to be that you would keep one person on the button and another person fighting them off, supporting each other while the rest of the group head to the next button so the duo can make their way to them and hit the final button so the group can regroup to destroy that control panel.
---
Instead they just leave one person on the first button alone, then another to the second, then have the first guy run as fast as possible back to them.  
---
Or let's look at the Uncategorized fractal.  A bunch of harpies are in the way and there is this robot in a poisonous room!  You'll have to fight off the harpies and get those crystals to their charging stations before the poison kills you!  
---
Or you can just run past the harpies, even though combat screws up your jumping but do it anyway, then you can reach the poisonous room, sneak around the robot, and stockpile crystals near the stations (If not just out-heal the poison and out-DPS the boss).  
---
Then there's that newer Fractal where you are some zombies in an army and need to cleave your way past all these enemies to reach the final boss room, leaving trails of dead bodies in your wake.
---
Or just run past them all.  Screw it.  
---
Aside from that, it's mainly been stuff where playing as a support seems redundant but playing a DPS doesn't feel as exciting as fighting in solo content, though I struggle to piece together what makes the penultimate boss of LS Season 3 Episode 1 (That girl with the maul) more interesting to fight than a fractal boss.  
---
Story progress is character based. Though you can swap between releases (episodes for LW seasons, or full expansions).
---
That said, there's occasional continuations to past choices in dialogue. This is most evident in HoT, PoF, and Season 4 Episodes 1 and 3 atm.
---
It might even be worth going through some stories on multiple characters, for those callbacks, though there isn't much difference in plot once you hit Claw Island in the personal story.

Thanks. I couldb't get it working until I used your instructions.
---
That plus the only time you get an advantage from the unbound harvesting tool is when harvesting guild hall nodes.  99% of the time you'll be getting a single harvest per node, unless you get that glyph that gives the 33% chance or are using an item booster effect or such.  If using an effect that gives chances of bonus gathering hits, then yeah, I'd suggest the unbound harvesting tool.  Otherwise use consortium or molten.
---
Not recommended, but it is. Can be very painful if it's older laptop though.
---
I still don’t think that this is necessary, but it’s nice to see GW2 being awarded for their good representation.
---
I’m gay myself, and I really enjoyed hearing the pact NPC in Jahai Bluffs taking about his husband and stuff. Not in-your-face, but it still stands out to me and makes me feel good.
---
We need more living story content. Just get one map each episode right now.

Why did people leave the pvp scene?

Dunno how involved they have to be to be considered main characters, but Caithe, Las, Jory

Day/Night cycle sucks because they don't utilize the directional lighting to its full potential (HoT zones did this better), there are no stretching shadows or sunrise/sunsets at all. there is never a hue of orange or red unless its purposefully setup to be that way (like Godslost Swamp)
---
Who's "everyone"?...because it's not "everyone".
---
Not being production quality code is one thing. Calling a buffer overflow that will only happen in very niche cases, writes a constant non-malicious value, and realistically only causes a crash if it ever gets triggered dangerous is extremely hyperbolic.  No-one has claimed this is production quality code, and responses like yours are why the dev didn't want to publish source and we ended up in the mess we are in.
---
What's the best fastest easiest class to map comp on?
---
Well anet takes several weird and wrong decision about esport some years ago... soo well pvp became less competitive and probably new elite specs and the poor league/at system didn't help too
---
Dont forget your dailies bro!
---
Dungeon rewards are not bad. A fast group nets about 40g per hour dungeon touring, it just requires a decent bit of skill
---
Hopefully this means the wizards Castle from gw1 is next to be tied up?
---
And he prolly didnt want to make his code public so cunts cant steal it

Not an expert but skipping trash mobs by stealth and any bugs probably saves the most time.

Not OP, but fellow JP portal Mesmer. I usually tip 1g to others, I feel like that's  a pretty fair amount. More is always appreciated, but at the end of the day even just a thank you is perfectly okay.
---
Yes I know. It was still terribly contrived though.
---
Thanks!
---
Yep. My point was to maybe not buy ALL of the collections as OP suggested, but the ones you might consider making.
---
Well, you chose the worst content to play support in. Those fractals are extremely easy so any heals become wasted and bosses die from hitting them with autos for 15 seconds. Try some harder content instead.
---
this happened to me, my partner sitting next to me with same PC did not get this, but friend playing in another country did in same team at Knight of embers cutscene in An Unknown Soul quest for sylvari story

6 monk runes have much higher value than ~50 stat gain from ascended piece compared to exotic one.
---
Fractals have an entire gold fractal weapon collection, a shiny as hell fractal backpack and a way to trade up tokens for infusions that actually add to stats. Not to mention prestige infusions like celestial infusion worth hundreds of gold and fashion tonics for showing off how fractal hardcore you are.
---
Raids have unique skins like dhuum staff and shoulders, three full legendary armor skins and functionality, a ghostly infusion that was worth a decent amount until supply overcame demand, and two giant prestige chair/thrones for showing off your raid hardcoreness to whoever cares.
---
It’s not like those things are missing from fractals and raids. LS4 just filled in a desire of some players to actually see earnable rewards in an open world format, instead of gem store only or in the group based formats above.
---
This is gambling on in game currency. It already exists in Gw2 - ecto gambling, mystic forge, probably a bunch more shit I forget. This wouldn't even be as bad as that since you're not gambling on pure RNG but rather the gamble is more educated. 
---
I need this in my guild hall, please

won't ever happen with this engine from the stoneage

Ah true, I forgot about its change to being a boon. Still think it felt the best at 33% though.

Glyph of flight(=100%movementfor5s)
---
Glyph of Bounty(=33%for xtrastrike) in sickle(home-ins=Glyph of bounty does not work on strike-limited nodes(rich node+home instance nodes+Guild hall+Orrian Oysters). Use bonus-drop glyphs or Industry instead), (With rich metal nodes, use (Glyph of Prospector=Grants a 33% chance to receive bonus ores while gathering in addition to your gathering results. Material types are determined by your character level and location in the world.)), Glyph of Leather in axe
---
&gt;Which might potentially have to do with the code basically turning of certain limiters and such and thus makes the game unstable. 
---
API call translation layers like this don't modify the behaviour of the game itself, they intercept said API calls then reimplement them in another API. Presuming the layer behaves properly and doesn't submit invalid calls or has other odd behaviour which ends up hosing the driver, the game would be unaware it's running as such.
---
There are a number of similar layers out there, Valve's ToGL and the Linux DXVK project come to mind.
---
I had a pretty nice laptop and played this on it from 2012 to 2016 or so just fine.

Would you mind sharing your thoughts on best glyph if all you do is WvW?

Lost myself at Risen Farmer. *Laugh* He even posed for it.
---
&gt;On the other hand, even half-assed content is better than no content
---
I strongly disagree with this notion. Half-assed content can be very damaging to the game's perception. Particularly in the case of newer or more casual players.
---
There is also the aspect as well, LS content has such a "epic" feeling to it precisely because it is something you play relatively rarely. Repetition will make anything stale, and is part of why you should never make your hobby a full time job.

I always appreciated that half of Tyria is crazier than having live fish in your boots.

I would be more in favor of your idea for scrapper to interact heavily with combo finishers if those weren't a forsaken, outdated and unreliable, almost incidental system outside PvP 1v1s.
---
Scrapper would end up tied to two things that simply don't live up to expectations: gyros and field interaction.
---
I'm just sorry you had to say that (tho I agree and completely understand why you did).
---
[Chakegg Sac](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chak_Egg_Sac)
---
I'm pretty sure that firecracker was always there, so it definitely should be possible without mounts (especially since a lot of player still don't own PoF).
---
Comparing similar damage levels, revenant's mobility-while-bombing is a large part of what sets them on top of, say, weaver.
---
Comparing FB, their key boons (combo of retal, quickness, and high stacking stability) are what set them ahead of tempest and scrapper.
---
Comparing scourge to... Everything, really, their barrier application with relatively zero loss on damage potential is why they're mandatory in broad groups.
---
Address all of those things by providing options and the issue of rev damage and scourge dominance goes away. All without number growth or shrink, which was the point of my comment, overall.
---
There's no circlejerk to be had there.
---
I appreciated the low effort joke. The line is apparently pretty long right now. Take a number and someone will be with you shortly. 
---
Is this really necessary? They are people just like us. Why feel the need to make a special award from just representing them well in games. 
---
Idk man i consider everyone as the same but when you create such awards for a specific set of people it incites a sense of exclusivity. Which i think is not healthy. To better the situation we should include them in every category not make exclusive categories now. But thats just my opinion.
---
Continuum split for extra disappointment. 
---
It's definitely possible. How we did it back in the day was to equip a trait that reduced fall damage, so you land with a little sliver of health left. Or you can just fall to your death and a nice person will come along soon to scrape you up :) 
---
&gt;...because anet likes money
---
because **NCSoft** likes money. publishers have more say on how things run. developers get to decide which compromises to make from those decisions.
---
cut Anet some slack. had they the ability to self-publish *and* develop, I'd think they'd ask for less money for these kinds of things.
---
well, its not hard to understand that fractals are a stepping stone into raids and while there are certainly "harder" raid bosses, there are those which are way easier then the content you do in fractals. is that so hard to understand? stepping stone: do harder fractals, do easier raidbosses, get a feeling to also do the other ones? what is not clear?  
---
why i assumed you said there is no healer? well you said damage in fracs as hard as possible so stuff doesn't hurt you. so i suppose you do it like other speedrunners and do not have a healer with you in fractals and also only run 1 druid in raids.  
---
guess we are not on the same page then.
---
I don't know what weapons he used, but Cobiah was from a gun era, but in the past, and is well known. He certainly fits the bill... Especially if we ended up in a water expansion... 
---
I think that Scrapper's pretty much there, it's just that people are sleeping on it.  I've been playing Scrapper for about a month now, and frankly it puts out an absolutely ludicrous amount of healing.  It's a super fun build.
---
It helps sometimes in WVW as well, you get a lot of multi-plant nodes there.

What armor pieces are you using?
---
Balance isn't the best, but it's also definitely not at the lowest point that it's been at. Just think about the sheer volume of viable builds. Are they all the best? No. Are some over tuned? Yes. But you can play a lot of very different stuff and aren't pigeon-holed to only certain builds like you may have been during previous seasons. 
---
And I respectfully disagree about a PVP title not being an achievement in most people's eyes. Whether or not win trading was happening at the very top (it was), the title was still taken by one of  the best 10 or so players. Its not as though the best PVPers don't get the titles season in and season out, and the titles are being bought from under them. If people don't think the titles have any value, its most likely IMO because they don't PVP or are jaded by the current low population. If anything that is the most legitimate criticism of the value of the titles (that they really don't mean as much now that population is low, so the skill required to be on the leader board is lower). Just my 2 cents though

Jumped into wvw with scourge. Looked at all skill cooldowns. Laughed for a minute. Swapped to thief.

As per his description, they were worried he could *become* an abomination:

Just between the two, herald will be more damage and gives assassin's presence to the group. Scrapper is just a safe choice so assuming the player is very experienced in both, herald wins out. If you really wanted to try hard it there are some setups that [have the off chrono as HK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrUhwe8EQwg) and can speed clear it (but that's not realistic outside of very organised groups)
---
I'm worried it becomes too build and rotation heavy at a point where support would be viable for fractals.  I would ideally like to just play a build I like in content that encourages a more action-combat focus.  
---
So a Glacial hammer firebrand cool.
---
Must have LW episodes? Goal is to farm stuff for ascended equipments. Prefer if map is generally populated. Thanks!

The amount of shit tier win traders who should have been permabanned here is absurd. What a fucking joke.

Was the "Lootstick Guard" really that good? Or was it just played by everyone because it was easy super easy to play and you got a ton of loot?
---
When I play staff tempest/weaver I am able to deal way more damage then any Scourge in my squad. But when I position myself at the commander I am going instantly down. And once the fight is over I have way less loot in my inventory compared to when I am playing Scourge or Firebrand. So even if I am useful, there is no reward for that!
---
Same goes for Mesmer. Mass Invis, Veil, Portals are still key skills that can super useful. But creating a nice portal ect. won't give you any loot.  
---
I have no Idea how to overcome this problems but you should be able to play what your Squads needs without worrying about loot.  
---
  
---
I really believe a lot of players are playing Scourge and Firebrand because they are easy to play and you get all the loot bags. 
---
I need à team ! I want my llama box. XD
---
No shit only few people playing in the middle of the night/early morning? What happened to sleep is for the weak?
---
For a strict answer you could probably find some info from gw2efficiency. People here are only focusing on the ridiculously priced stuff, not on actual rarity. Those are more likely to be items that are [worthless one-time things held on to for sentimental reasons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Champion_Sariel_Loot_Box)

there are no HoT specific mounts when you get PoF but there is PoF specific guild hall

&gt;Was the "Lootstick Guard" really that good? Or was it just played by everyone because it was easy super easy to play and you got a ton of loot?
---
Only a really bad leeching guard ran staff constantly while spamming 1. The things you needed on staff was lines and, sigil spikes, 22 heals etc.
---
You also had a greatsword that you where supposed to use each time you leap to pull in casters etc so they laneded in the necros wellspikes or mark spike.
---
Guard was a lot more than autorun and spam 1111111.
---
&gt; When I play staff tempest/weaver I am able to deal way more damage than any Scourge in my squad. But when I position myself at the commander I am going instantly down. And once the fight is over I have way less loot in my inventory compared to when I am playing Scourge or Firebrand. So even if I am useful, there is no reward for that! 
---
As a long range caster you are not supposed to be in the com, unless called to do so or if you are pushing into some thing where you need to stack for dmg mitigation (sm lord room etc). 
---
You are supposed to sit outside your blob and pressure the enemy group so they can't free cast on your group.And to restrict their movement when possible.
---
If you are sitting on the commander with an ele you are just asking to get killed, and you are putting yourself in a bad spot where you can't do dmg as often as you should.
---
&gt; Same goes for Mesmer. Mass Invis, Veil, Portals are still key skills that can super useful. But creating a nice portal ect. won't give you any loot. 
---
This is just a git guud problem, all you need is a staff or any type of aoe skills to tag people with. You are not there for dmg anyways so run w/e gets you loot.
---
&gt; I have no Idea how to overcome this problems but you should be able to play what your Squads needs without worrying about loot. 
---
You solve this by playing your class to it's strenght! So as an ele you stay in a spot where you can always drop dmg on the enemy blob while still being close enough to your own so you don't get easily ganked.
---
&gt; I really believe a lot of players are playing Scourge and Firebrand because they are easy to play and you get all the loot bags, not because they are the best option. 
---
Plenty of people play ranger too.
---
A lot of people play necro/guard because any wvw server will be asking you to play them. And yes they are in general easier to get loot with and stay alive with as their main job is to stay as a thight group unlike eles who dance around the group, or warriors who push deep for bubbles or to catch caster that are to far out.

I played through the story, and got some stepping plate and killed a gravelling. But I haven’t figured out what happens next. Where do I find out?
---
Yes. You're right. Slavery does exist let's don't think about it. Moving on.
---
Oh yes you're right. Violence does exist. Well, let's move....
---
Sorry for these "too much" examples
---
It is not because something exists since a long time that you should let it happen. If it's not right. You should do something against. But i know that some people never feel concern about anything. Moving on is a mantra for them and they never raise against anything.
---
And by the way. I've said "usual". If you quote feel free to quote exactly what people say. This behaviour shouldn't be usual/regular. But yes i can't understand that sometimes it happens. Sometimes =/= often.
---
Friendly upvote. Thanks for the Welcome. ;-)
---
&gt;What's the best fastest easiest class to map comp on?
---
Daredevil with Staff and Shortbow seems wells suited: Permastealth for highly contested HeroPoints and Vistas, high mobility even infight, really fast diving for underwater hearts, good aoe and single target dps.
---
this is a highly mobile and stealth/skip heavy build. under the assumption that you wont have trouble killing stuff in core tyria with ascended gear i sacrificed (crit-)damage for mobility and cleansing. if you know that youll fight a lot of champs and/or enemies with breakbars you might need to make some adjustments.
---
so the strenghts of this build are: 3 dodgerolls instead of 2; dodgerolls go further -&gt; faster maneuvering while not mounted; dodging gives swiftness; swiftness gives +66% movement speed (superior rune of speed, expensive though!); dodging grants vigor, vigor is buffed; high cleansing of conditions -&gt; lets you mount quicker after fights (beeing blinded - a condition that often has a long duration -  doesnt allow you to go out of combat f.e.);
---
to stealth yourself use either shadow refuge (easy to use) and stay in the field until it expires or cast smoke screen and use Shortbow 2 in it to combo blast into smoke. not that you must not hit any foe with your #2 and dont use it in too quick succession or else you'll detonate your cluster bomb mid air, which deals nice aoe damage but aint a blast finisher; stealing also stealthed you.
---
shadowstep is your flex slot, but its nice as a stun break and lets you gather/aggro distant foes quicker;
---
use basilisk venom as elite if you need break bar damage;
---
shortbow is your utility weapon which also lets you tag multiple enemies easily if you're farming events; staff is your damage slot when solo

Wonder if he could be the E that's been writing to kasmere or whoever and working for the shining blade. That's would be a dope twist. He would be such a cool character to bring back just due to his nature of being like an A.I. and connecting between both games.

Chess Dragon strikes again!

only if they transfer the majority of skins and maybe even characters ;)

but I guess content is also a big thing, they also invested a lot in GW2 and I'm far from done yet. tbh I don't care that much about core tyria but HoT and PoF + LS somehow need to be converted/transferred.

Please don't take this as mockery but I am legit going to replace "scapegoat" in my vocabulary with "escape goat", it makes me imagine a goat in a safety vest and it will confuse my friends and I love it so thank you for that. 
---
On topic though, I would really really love for a few episodes to just be utter chaos after this. How could we let this happen? Why did everyone put so much faith in us? The pact is shaken, Logan struggles to keep the orders and all the tribes WE convinced to join us together. Kralk wreaks havoc on the world and we have to dash around to evacuate people ahead of him and try to clean up this complete mess we've caused. I want to hit a low point. A real, real low point. I wanna find my commander draped over a bar somewhere because she had no idea what to do or how she got in to this mess. Then, I wanna see her pull herself together. With the help of her friends. I wanna see people from my story come out of the woodwork to lift my spirits. Then I wanna try again.

Scourge needs to be nerfed to the ground? Spellbreaker needs a buff? Man you need to play wvw before making piss poor Reddit posts about it. 
---
I think you miss tagged your post. This reads more like a rant, blowing off steam and yelling at clouds than anything else.
---
She does. Not sure when it triggers, but it's in the forge area
---
Yeah it's a bit weird
---
Oh, if only there was some universal resource that could be exchanged for very different goods and services, then it could be reallocated to where we want it more... like, say, "money".
---
Rev stacking is also a high value source of pretty much all the offensive boons outside of quickness. Heralds and renegades alternating in parties can overwhelm bad strip/corrupt comps very quickly with fast reapplication.
---
They also perform best on hammer at 900-1200 range, which is part of *why* scourge pressure under 900 is so important, it helps keep folks in the rev sweet spot. All of these stacked classes being able to run and gun also impacts diversity.
---
Nothing said of insane ease of play. "A good weaver" is a much higher skill cap than a mediocre rev, but people go for ease of play over everything else.
---
It's simply too easy to access a lot of the value you're talking about.
---
The older the game gets, the more this will happen, unless it's stomped on. But where should that stomp come from, is my point? Do we want a lower value sub-900 game, or more diversity within the sub-900 game? Because nerf scourge, or buff sb renegade/dazebow thief, have similar outcomes - that's where the problem comes in.

In the olden days, Silverwastes was the defacto farming spot. That's just not true anymore.
---
Two weeks ago a new zone was created that required an awful lot of farming to get the stuff in it. That zone is busy day and night. Today I did a Dragon Stand run that was completely packed. I haven't done a Silverwastes run in ages.
---
You say that you'd expect it to be packed because of the event? Why would it be? 
---
After I get a couple of weeks of envelopes I'll open them all at once, at which time I have to do the Vinewrath one time. Why open envelopes now?  Easier to wait and blow all my buffs at the same time that repeat events in the  Silverwastes.
---
The Silverwastes is great for free to play players, but some of us have done the Sliverwastes enough where we do it when we need to do it and do other stuff in the mean time.
---
And it still gets done. Just not at every hour of every day.
---
It's not that the game is less populated, it's that the population has shifted to other areas.

"You are making us look bad."
---
I think you do, OP is spot on
---
none, its awful in this game.
---
It's a waste of resources to create such good story instances without giving it any replayability. For the long-term players it would be a welcome change because most LW episodes are so neglectable once completed.
---
What is the build you are using?
---
That still doesn't mean the main problem is revenants, without scourge a melee train would be on top of revenants quick enough to nullify their damage. The big difference between ele and rev is health, on marauders my rev has 27K health minmum, whereas ele has maybe 18-19K.
---
After a couple seconds of the commander saying the line in the picture, one of the charr asks the others "what's a book club?" That's the joke.
---
Outfits do not have a QA requirement to work with every other armor set released in the specific weight class.
---
It’s objectively less work and we can surmise that they sell well since annet continues the model. 
---
I prefer armor sets as well but objectively they do not make sense as long as outfits are profitable. 
---
That being said, annet has been stepping there in game armor set game up since PoF. Which is awsome.  
---
&gt;boonshare mesmer being removed from the game because of PvE
---
I'm glad someone else sees this change for what it is. I've been playing boonshare exclusively in wvw/gvg for the past few years, so getting my build deleted because it was too effective in some scripted minigame was pretty disappointing. It's the reason I finally quit playing.
---
It's a worthy cause though, which people would be happy to see. The game is really poorly optimized at the moment, there are many areas in the game with hard frame drops for almost no reason. My best guess based on my experience is bad handling of draw calls since where the game really becomes a slideshow is in heavily packed areas like cities (not just LA where there are players, but also emptier ones like The Grove, Black Citadel etc) and some of the big places in PoF like Amnoon, Garden of Seborhin etc. In these areas you can't achieve 60fps almost no matter the settings.
---
It really hurtd
---
Thank god you left! I am very glad you did!
---
Honestly now, who cares that you left? Just because a class got one (out of 10000) possible builds deleted makes you leave the game? Wow, you are very fragile. Instead just try 99999 other possibilitys.
---
Anyway, no more ressources wasted on you, so thank you!
---
those zaishen keys :')
---
Would also like to know - looks really nice 
---
That's the point though, if you're in melee with any other class they're only hitting 5 targets while scourge is hitting 10 therefore preventing any other melee option from being viable since they will always be out performed by scourge. So people just stack revs to counter scourges since they outrange them, but then you can't push the revs to nullify their ranged advantage because of the hoard of angry scourges just waiting for you to get within melee range.
---
anet is self publishing since hot and their money schemes are even more obvious than where ncsoft was in charge
---
Why not the infusions ?
---
I always suspected it was merely scheduling issues with the voice actresses. Same reason Zojja is essentially permanently out of the game.
---
LOL I was tired.
---
And I agree with you, that is the vision I have for the story. 
---
is it really subtle though? 
---
I remember the sylvari personal story one, which occurs as soon as you start the game, it was anything but subtle.
---
Considering other MMO styles of tackle to story telling, it is one of the best. 
---
Did you see what happens? What did you think of it?
---
because they are pretty common already (to many ppl play the metas to get a shot on them). not one day goes by that I not see someone with infusions.
---
That's definitely not a sleeper build, we've played it and it was good with superspeed but otherwise Firebrand just does better all in one package now that they nerfed the biggest reason you'd want to have Scrappers with you over another Firebrand.
---
The thing to understand about raids is that they're misrepresented by communities like this that obsess over benchmarks and small details or whatever. People might only be seeing raids from the perspective of the tryhard raiders.
---
So as someone who did a bit of raiding with my guild back in the day, got about 60 LI then lost interest - it's not difficult to get into, most bosses are not particularly challenging, and it can be a fun social activity to do with people. The issue is that many tryhards vastly overestimate what it takes to raid successfully, I guess in an effort to present their favorite content as some high skill floor, elite content, and this puts people off. Skill is almost a non factor as it is in basically any form of PvE, it's about practice and boss knowledge. If more people knew what it's really like they wouldn't be so put off.
---
Personally I haven't raided in years, last wing I played was w4. I don't see myself returning to it other than to finish the first leggy armor collection either. But others might find it way more sustainable and fun long term if they tried. The only thing I would say is get into it with a guild not Pugs, there are tons of noob friendly ones in EU at least. At some point you will have done certain bosses so many times you'll also be comfortable pugging those. 
---
To start with if a squad is full then it is taken off from the lfg-tool (or so it should) So you have no clue how many maps that are open, and can only see your own. Second some maps do not even do lfg because it progress well on their own. 
---
Third, EU have a night time which mean around 3-4 -5 in the night/morning you will not find as much people because in EU we sleep. You find some who play from other time zones or people who are awake at that time for reasons, but most of us are sleeping. If you expect as much action at this time of night then your expectations are to high. And especially since Silver Waste is not the only farm map. For example at that time of night if i am up i rather go Dragon Stand because there is usually at least one map up for that. 
---
Your whole post is at the nicest silly and not very well thought through.
---
Some of you are being overprotective of the game on this thread and not even reading what I said. I love the game and this is not a hate thread, so don't be a mindless ape and treat it as such by downvoting every damn argument I make without even considering my point. Do you really think that 5-10 players doing Silverwastes at 6AM in the entire continent of Europe is a realistic number? That is is not at all a technical limitation? And it's not just Silverwastes. It's most of the ingame things you do.
---
But there are guild features blocked by HoT even though these are global or at least expansion features that should be unlocked with PoF.
---
Imagine if new elite specs from PoF you only could get if you had HoT. That's the practice anet did with guilds you are trying to defend.
---
NA always have less activity regardless of time then EU. 
---
Better guilds maybe but certainly not general meta yet
---
Anyone got a good open world pve power Chrono build? I just hit 80 and unlocked full Chrono traits so idk which 3 trait to run now. I used to run Dom, illusion and dueling. I'm not sure which one to take out to replace Chrono. And I'm using S/S and GS. Please advise.

---
Ultra rare infusions from event drops are really rare.
---
There are also a few obscure items /skins that have a weird way of dropping. 
---
One of such is the delusion staff that can only be acquired from the Mystic Forge ,and cant be sold or bought as its becomes bound the second you get it.
---
Some dungeon recipies are rare as you get them from dungeon bosses which not many people are farming. But the crafted items from those recipies can be bought on tp.
---
Good point!

Thanks Crusty, looking forward to converting you into a warrior main too :\^)
---
So from what I understand, you DID GET some refund for YOUR mistake. Not the right refund, but it shows at least some will to help you on their side. Seriously the only way for your post to make sense would be "then things went worse, they never read what I wrote ... and they permabanned me based on bullshit". Not "... and they tried to help and went wrong".
---
Seriously man, they have no obligation to help you in such circumstances. It's your mistake, you did something in the game, your problem. Turns out they have a nice support policy that actually deals with such cases. Your level of entitlement is pretty high.
---
And I can't believe you ditched, as you claim, a 18char 35kap 11k hours (+gw1 years) entirely just because of a problem with not helping you in the way you hoped for a single crafting mistake. It just makes no sense. There must be something else you're not telling us.

If you’re on NA servers, keep an eye out for u/emikadon’s map completion train announcements on here; she usually runs a map completion train on the first saturday of each month. Otherwise, just use the LFG/keep an eye out in VB mapchat for a hero point train. Hope this helps.
---
&gt;So are you of the mind that if we did not have dps meters in the game we would have less toxicity or assholish behavior in grp content?
---
Like I said, it goes both ways. We would certainly see less toxicity in the form of shaming people for low DPS, but we'd likely see an increase in class shaming and other forms of toxicity. 
---
&gt;I think its important to remember ppl have limited time and wanting clear times to be lower is not inherently a bad thing.
---
No, it isn't a bad thing. But shaming people for not performing to your standards or just leaving after 1-2 wipes is a bad thing. Even if you're wiping, you're still playing the game! Wiping is a key part of high-level instanced content. If you're so hung up on getting your reward and doing it smoothly, then join a static of like-minded people. Don't expect that in pugs. (I'm talking in general here not you specifically!)
---
Yes, and my family's money as well. Have it all!
---
What you're suggesting is straight up direct power creep. The only way to avoid it is to nerf instead of buffing. 
---
Thought the same
---
He's right to be happy about it though. Boonshare mesmer post HoT was terrible for wvw. There was a variant prior the expansion that kept boons up with runes like altruism (I think), guard-mesmer interaction etc. Here for example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs3\_KdFnNiI&amp;t=185s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs3_KdFnNiI&amp;t=185s) and there it already was insanely strong.
---
Having Boons like quickness/alacrity/stab/resistance permanent is simply broken. Resistance was already a poor implementation by itself.
---
Support mesmer existed in variants since the beginning of the game. If the meta gets back to be more melee, veil/time warps, etc could possibly shine again. If stuff gets squishier (what I could only see with removable of minstrel gear tho), mes/thieves/ranger could get more of the picker-role again. Not like it was years ago, but maybe somehow.
---
"I dont play that mode so its shit and nobody should play it"
---
make another petition to keep the changes to istan
---
&gt; Are all meta raid builds utilizing 2+ Chronomancers?
---
2 boon chronos. 
---
Technically correct is the best kind of correct.
---
I wish there was a similar thing for Dx11. I'm still using Win7, and Dx12 needs Win10.
---
&gt; combat medic type character 
---
Yeah, I like playing druid in Dragon's Stand, but in most open world content support isn't really needed as most builds are very self-sufficient. 
---
What content do you have access to? PoF/HoT/Living World?
---
/r/shrimptank
---
Most easier way IMO is to using [Gw2Launcher](https://github.com/Healix/Gw2Launcher) \- it isolates GW2 client data into separate windows accounts (you have to create them first). So now for each gw2 account you have different local.dat file and with "remember" option you can still log in into different accounts w/o putting credentials.
---
MAKE ISTAN GREAT AGAIN. After all i need you guys to farm it, so i can buy it cheap and sell it back to you for profit.
---
A normal Norn NPC by day, a Roller Beetle Race finish flag by night. 
---
Exactly, show ANet they are doing a great job and that's why the game is being loved by everyone
---
All addons that modify d3d9.dll should chainload d912pxy by their own.
---
"Firebrand just does better all in one package"
---
This pretty much. Even in PvP this is still the case. Heal scrapper and heal tempest are actually really good, but firebrand is still simply better. That doesn't mean they need buffs, it means nerfing damage output/condi output is essential to make them viable (tempest can't keep up with the insane damage of Holo, deadeye, rev, scourge, reaper, etc, even the condi output of condi mes alone is already to much for him).
---
Also don't dodge into the walls at Soulless Horror. Never happened to me btw. I swear.
---
High ping is how all benchmarks should be done
---
Is the build linked in snowcrows the boon Chronomancer?
---
Nice job husky :) 
---
True endgame 
---
actually wondering why we can't just sell them back as it's even listed on the support page meaning it's gotta be a common occurance
---
Bah, I was expecting some Bookah wordplay.
---
Sorry for the stupid question, but you mean replayability as in with 18 different characters, right? I don't recall that replaying the same story instance on the same character would give the, for example, viper reward again. If it did, I'd facepalm myself for not realizing it :).
---
Lol, 50% of public only commanders still live in pre hot playstyle.
---
Did you manage to hold all of those limes?
---
Sees post about competitive GW2 play.
---
Sees comment about needing content in an area of GW2 play.
---
Comments about needing more of the only content GW2 continues to churn out on a regular basis.
---
Yep, your PVE privilege is showing. Put your hand down. 
---
Yeah. 18 times with 18 different characters. 
---
Yes. It's a highly min maxed build. New players should start with higher boon duration.
---
All I ask is they split the skills. The nerf to Rev sword 4 was so unneeded in PvE, I wish they'd split it.
---
If they nerf Rev hammer damage without splitting it I will actually cry. Please don't destroy an already struggling class in PvE (dps-wise). I'd love to play power Herald in fracs/raids and not get laughed at.

This is my mesmer 'Fiction or Reality' [https://imgur.com/a/SYH9WCy](https://imgur.com/a/SYH9WCy)
---
And the Ancestral Guard shield. After several patches, the still don't have unlock skin option.
---
Yeah, i'm outright refusing to come back to the game until mesmer situation is resolved for WvW. It's just bullshit that something that is kinda effective gets totally nuked, because it was too effective in 1 instance of PvE, PVE!!!, when they have skill split technology. Fucking ANet, they never knew what to do with WvW and they still don't.
---
It's ineffective to play, when it is played it's used for like 5 skills all together and it's simply not fun. Hell it's not fun since start of PoF to play mesmer, but i did it, now it's just pointless.
---
We can only speculate. Tbh Anet could go in both directions. It'd definitely make sense if Pale Mother was able to absorb magic but, by the same token, I don't if this is the right path for her. Surely, it'd impact all Sylvari if the being they're all connected to became an Elder 'Dragon'? 
---
It's not gun violence, it's black people violence.
---
"Braham decided to tackle Jormag by himself, but brought along a group of Norn with him on that hunt" is kinda contradictory to this "Norn never team up or follow others."
---
Norn aren't stupid, they aren't monolithic. Norn choose to join the orders because they want to. Often times we see them referenced or commenting as being part of the three orders for the purpose of fighting unique and challenging foes and dragon minions that they wouldn't find in the shiverpeaks.
---
As somebody said, the norn literally have the spirit of the wolf, who is all about THE PACK. Working TOGETHER. " Wolf Spirit is one of the more prominent deities of the [norn](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Norn).  Wolf represents the virtues of loyalty, ferocity, and strength in  numbers and is often invoked for help in tracking the norn's prey. "
---
Likewise, we see Norn often gathering around homesteads, often run by an individual who has total control over who is allowed in or not. Hoelbrek is quite literally that to the Norn, Knut's homestead. If he walked up to anybody and told them to leave Hoelbrek and never return, all other Norn would respect that.
---
As a RACE, the Norn don't really have a government or armies, or bow to others, but individuals vary greatly. It's kinda hard to be all "Eir and Braham choosing this specific action it totally not like a Norn!" and then say that norn value individuality. Which is it? Can Eir and Braham choose their own path, or must they conform?
---
I think he turned 20 in season 3 IIRC.
---
Cooperative missions were one of the best things about GW1, it's so sad they didn't keep them around for the sequel.
---
The whole final mission of HoT would be a perfect dungeon, a 5-man boss gauntlet.
---
No no you got it wrong:  
---
Story instance (solo for story purpose), then you unlock 5-man dungeon (exploration) for daily rewards. This should be the same instance like the story but with daily replay-ability value added to it.
---
Petitions against game changes really make me chuckle.
---
i agree, those would be great as dungeons, i recently replayed the personal story final instance that is basically an arah path, wich is great [even if, with the powercreep, i could solo it without any problem]
---
back in the day i played with full team the mordremoth fight to help them with migraine achievement, it was very fun, and i would love to do the same for pof and ls epic battles, but that didnt happen sadly.
---
having those as 5men content would help also reward wise, i mean, i'd prefer to get an ascended item or a particular skin with a challenge rather than collections or meta achievements.
---
(The energy orbs are from the backpack)
---
You can open the Gerent's chest multiple times a day, only the [Hero's Choice Chest](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tangled_Depths:_Hero%27s_Choice_Chest) is limited to one per day.
---
Are you sure you haven't autolooted the chest, as 3 mins aren't that much?
---
also, every dungeon set could benefit having a proper backpack, they were introduced later as a regular fashion object [i remember when you could only go for guild backpack, engi starter backpack and mad memories\wintersday gift backpack and things like that]
---
It's called talking about one's experience. It's a thing some people do if they share a common hobby. It's a socializing thing.
---
That was a great read, thank you. Regarding your ending, I suggest the Griffon first. It's a really useful mount.
---
So, now that you have played through PoF, you're about to explore season 4 of the Living World. You are in for a WILD ride. Hope you are prepared.
---
i did the same, full viper armor for my engi even if i didnt used too much back in the days, almost all chack\auric skins, mordrem loop that required migraine achievement [that was pretty much better to do in a party], we get also a black lion key on the first instance in TD [roots of terror if i remember correctly]
---
i have TONS of alt, just one per class with core maps, but everyone with hot story done, at least 'till last instance, wich kept me busy a lot 
---
Thanks for the reply. I just redid the event and recieved the hero's choice chest.  
---
On a serious note: Why are players I blocked allowed to join my squad?
---
Can you tell me about the ooze.
---
Does it go into the new Novelties System?
---
Is it permanent like the Evon Gnashblade Badge until you deactivate it or does it behave like the Halo and deactivates after map switch or dows it have a timer?
---
Is this crocheting?
---
&gt; You can try run this on linux with wine &amp; vkd3d, but note that d912pxy uses sm5.1. (Someone noted it works but deleted his comment)
---
I was trying to get this figured out yesterday but have no idea where to begin; should vkd3d just work with a regular Wine build? Or do I need to compile Wine in a specific manner?
---
Everyone would be happy to have better rewards for a single run, but that didn't happen at all... A single run now is worse than a single run before
---
I honestly don't even know why you still bother trying to help this community. Kudos to you, though.
---
Great work cant wait to use it once arc and reshade work with it as well but for now its great for running on my laptop
---
Nice work, will probably try this when I have time for it ~~, which will be never kms~~

[Sleep is forbidden.](https://youtu.be/xxUrKaVU4hw?t=44)
---
Humour me, how do you "complete" PvP/WvW?
---
No 32 bit support sorry, not enough RAM available. (Max 3GB iirc)
---
The **WORLD WRESTLINGGGGG FEDERATION**
---
Looks very promising, that would be finally a reason for me to switch to Windows 10, when it gets more fleshed out in the feature.
---
Sorry for all that reddit backslash you got, to many just acted immaturely and hopping on the hate train
---
No. on 32bit you are limited by 4GB RAM in total and that means you cannot effectively use application that has reccomended 16GB ram available for all of it...
---
Releasing open source software is a difficult and thankless job. So thanks op and good luck 
---
It's only a security risk if you are stupid, just like your house keys (if you choose not to use them i.e. some idiot puts their key under a flowerpot and the landlord takes everyone's keys away, forcing you to call him/her to be let into your own house).
---
You are supposed to keep personal information in your own area in windows and the only way someone could access items on my desktop is if they broke into my house and turned my computer on, ergo I have a bigger security issue than a computer game. Besides, if someone did that and I used the launcher they could still log into my game account by launching the game. 
---
This is only a an issue for people who share a computer and windows doesn't grant you access to other users desktops unless you force it to or store personal information outside of your allocated space.
---
I take security seriously enough on my main game account that I use two factor authentication and have locked to my up, if someone had my login details they couldn't use them without also having my phone!  Put simply a remote attack is as likely to be able to copy Local.dat as it is a shortcut on my desktop as both are in the same users folder in the windows install, yes the shortcut is in plain text, no it is not unsecure as it is protected by my windows password just like all my personal files. 
---
This is probably about blame, some idiots who created shortcuts in stupid places have probably blamed Anet, unfortunately Anet can't respond by pointing out that people who can't use computers probably should avoid computer games so we have Anet removing the feature for everyone.  
---
Which is a shame. There are so many opportunities for reward structures on older content that make sense instead of all the time gated nonsense we get.
---
I'll be honest, I had doubts and criticised you in another thread but I'd like to take the time to apologise and thank you for your contribution.
---
Better performance in GW2 is something a lot of us have been asking about for a while and the sudden introduction of a .dll claiming to increase performance just like that, I feel made us think that it was too good to be true and something else must been going on.
---
After reading reply's to my last comment, which for some of it I still stand by, I can understand why your reaction was how it was. Putting your own time and effort into something just to get hate in return must suck.
---
So I for one am sorry and I really do appreciate the time you spent to make this for us. I will definitely be using it in the future. Thank you.
---
So I'm not the only one that cringes when a normal calls us "coders"? 
---
Surprised that you are still trying to help considering your reception.  Appreciate the hard work
---
In a way, fractals are training raids. A lot of bosses have raid like mechanics, that you just can't ignore. If you are confident in fractals, you can be confident in raids too.
---
You wouldn't see performance improvements for 11.
---
Should upgrade to Win 10 anyways. 
---
Not at all savy with coding, but to rephrase the earlier question: if the dx9 to dx12 translation is indeed beneficial as the reddit Dev says to performance, why is Anet not following a similar approach? Note, I am not criticising or poking holes in the tool/app.. Just general curiosity. 
---
They should just allow a combo finisher to use multiple combo fields, provided those fields are of different types.

Yes!

---
We're all cool with this now? The other day when we did this there was talk of keyloggers and other funny business. Just making sure.
---
Honestly, I am happy with it. Yes, it is not a very diverse meta, but at least it is fun. Fights in big groups are often relatively even, take longer than 30 seconds and the balance between melee ball and pirate ship is mostly right. The Spellbreaker Nerf was right, as it allows you to finally push again.
---
Rev needs to be nerfed or boon sources for  protection/aegis need a buff. 
---
Snowcrows is a good place to start, but the mimic+SoI rotation is a bit reliant on everything going perfectly and I find it stressful. Two wells + SoI might be easier to maintain as a learner (but boon duration will matter more).
---
For mimic+SoI, boon duration mostly buys you a greater margin of error as you have more time to catch boons with SoI. 
---
For two wells, the base duration is quite long so boon duration extends it even further, but you need to be comfortable with the time delay and aiming the wells.  
---
Snowcrows is best for very skilled players, but if you're learning you may find something works better, as a pretty good player running a pretty good build is better than a panicking player running a meta build with no room for error. 
---
ReShade doesn't even work with dx12 ... so no change
---
Didn't know Aurene was in Flashdance.
---
arc is enough already tbh my reshade settings are quite subtle
---
God I love this one! It has such a nice theme, and a great color scheme!
---
There's a soft trinity now; for example druids, tempest, firebrand, revenant and scourge are able heal (although scourges basically 'heal' through providing shields) &amp; chronomancers are/were (not 100% up-to-date on this, sorry) considered "tanks" due to their damage avoiding abilities ... but these roles basically only really matter for raids afaik; but I'm truly no expert on that :D
---
didn't know that crystal infusion actually looks pretty good now i need this hr
---
The game has rolls. 
---

---
Is screenshot functionality just a temporary problem, like will you be able to get it working at some point?
---
Also, is there some problem with high refresh rates? Something feels really somehow kinda off with d912pxy on 240hz?
---
Screenshots are very important to me, but this does make fps much more tolerable on some heavy places. Awesome work nevertheless, really looking forward to future versions.
---
that was when the code wasnt open source and MardsEdge found something probably suspicious. megai2 made it open source and various other developers inspected it. see here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ajp187/source_code_for_d912pxy_is_up/
---
Mesmer and Necromancer, regardless of race are both good. High damage, meta specs, good survivability and burst. With proper play you can solo many champions either illusion kiting or minions.
---
it always had roles but classes were never locked to play just one at a time even back then people were dps/support
---
Because non-furries can play charr to and get art of them. Doesn't mean it's classified as "furry". Technically, anything that is a homebrew character that is a humanoid creature could be considered anthro, from aliens to... whatever honestly. But if it's an established race in a video game doesn't automatically make it a furry. If a furry artist draws it, they're just drawing charr. Heck, Asura could be considered furry as well. 
---
And once again, style is totally subjective. If you really want, I can pm you multiple artists charr art, be they furry artists or not. You probably wouldn't be able to tell.

---
Yeah that's cool, and I appreciate that they have representation that I can feel connected to without it being hamfisted - so that I might not notice or remember - but I really can't remember any so it struck me as odd that GLAAD was pointing it out and wanted to know if anyone remembered 
---
Didn't I basically say that in my statement though?
---
I've tried it, to be honest I didn't expect this kind of improvement. Haven't crashed yat, and the performance gain is very, very noticable. Great job!
---
For storing data so that the CPU won't have to load from disk? I think.. 
---
Yeah, definitely. Also some people will DPS shame without *thinking* of the context, like say bringing less damage utilities so you can strip boons, provide stability, keep people up -- this happens a fair bit in fractals, less so in raids.
---
For me, whenever I do fractal dailies with 'No Pain, No Gain' on them, I don't really care about dealing max DPS, but about making sure the boss has as little boon uptime as possible and enabling the others to burst it down fast.
---
I just recently hit level 80 and bought myself some decent gear to begin fractals.  My next goal is ascended.  I've done some research on how to obtain ascended gear, but my question is, where should i begin and what should i be doing daily wise?
---
I started testing this application, it's very good work as far as stability goes. It's not perfect but I applaud your effort, I'll try to give feedback as much as I can. Thank you for this friend.. laptop users should be especially grateful.
---
can anyone tell me how to use it with arcdps together? since d3d9.dll name is the same.
---
Dope thanks for the malware 👍 
---
Its 5-10% depending on the poll some had just 2 choices some had multiple allowing for better representation of different orientations  . At least from all the different pools over the years that were taken all over the world  .If it was 20% and more I dont think we would still be increasing our global population so fast. Still the exact % does not matter as long as all have the same rights and are treated with with equal respect.
---
I’m missing cutscenes textures as well, on zojja in my personal story, and also the vigil kitty leader lady.

---
what are the benefits of running the game in dx12?
---
Does gw2 have an authentication? It's been a long time since I set up my 2FA for it, but I don't remember that option there.
---
There was something used that could, if told to do so, be used to send data to someone else's computer so people were worried it was stealing passwords and other data. 
---
Now that it's been examined, the consensus is that that's not the case and the code was actually just being used in another way that wasn't doing any harm.
---
Let's say you got home and saw a stranger standing in the kitchen with a knife - you'd freak out. If your partner came in and said "hey, this is Steve, he's showing me how to make sushi" you'd chill out and maybe think you overreacted a bit. It's like that.

---
There's several ways to obtain ascended gear. But before I list the ways you can obtain it, I'm gonna list the *order of priority* you get ascended stuff with.
---
Why? Because stats-wise, weapons and trinkets (backpiece, rings, accessories, amulets) are a bigger stat increase than armor, and also easier/cheaper to obtain. So always focus on those, and leave armor as the last thing.
---
So what I'd suggest you do is: 
---
=
---
**Weapons:**
---
- Do your specialization collection (PoF or HoT, former is easier but requires more running around, while the latter is a bit more grindy but straightforward).
---
- Finish HoT's story and do the Knight of the Thorn quest (you can get one ascended weapon per character that can be swapped into various different forms, like sword, greatsword, shield, scepter and dagger).
---
- RNG drops (do Tequatl and Triple Trouble for this, there's a small chance you'll get ascended drops, fractals have it too but you need to be at least at T3 for a decent-ish chance).
---
- Collection achievement rewards (you can collect all the machined weapon skins for an ascended weapon chest of your choice).
---
- Level your crafting to 500 then craft an ascended weapon (most expensive way, would not recommend doing this if you're lacking gold, but it's straightforward).
---
**Trinkets:**
---
- LS S3, a lot of people farm Winterberries at Bitterfrost Frontier to get a backpiece, accessory and ring. I would suggest Bloodstone Fen as well, it's harder to gather the map currency but they are stat-swappable which means they're better for long-term planning. But whichever maps you pick, you should be able to get a full set from LS S3 alone. Will need to unlock them though, so if you don't have them save up on gold to buy gems.
---
- Guild missions give guild commendations, which you can use to buy ascended trinkets.
---
- Laurels can be used to buy them too, but you can't get them from anywhere else beyond daily log-ins.
---
- Mawdrey is a pretty cheap backpiece you can make. Some PoF collections give ascended backpieces as well.
---
- Mystic Forge allows you to build a backpiece, but it's expensive. Don't do this unless you're rich.
---
- Fractals sometimes drop ascended rings, if you get a lucky drop you can use it (like a zerker stat ring).
---
**Armor:**
---
- Crafting will be the most reliable method, but expensive, around 50 gold per piece.
---
- RNG, if you've been doing daily Teq and TT while doing the weapons and trinkets you might be lucky enough to get 1-2 pieces at least from there, always pick chest and leggings first. If you're in T3 fractals by now, you might get some lucky drops. Expect lots of gloves. And shoulders. And the rare helm...
---
- Collection achievements give you ascended armor chests as well. Collecting all the leystone armor skins gives you one, so if you like Dragon's Stand go farm it a bit. Making ambrite weapons and the Silverwastes armor sets also gives you free ascended armor boxes, but those take time to do.
---
Lol, you sir are were badly misinformed.
---
hey  rangers are cool
---
True dat.  Though, I was more talking in concrete terms, as in what they bring to the overall Tyria party.  Hope's all well and good, but if you can't actually *do* anything useful, you're...kinda vestigial, narratively speaking.  Give them the task of magic regulation and suddenly, bam, they provide something concrete and definitely useful that can't be easily replicated by the other species.
---
Actually, now that I think about it, I did notice how in a lot of the story, the Sylvari kinda acted as the middle men between the other races with perhaps the exception of the Asura.  Though, that could be chalked up to the Asura being a race largely comprised of insufferable assholes, but I digress.  The Sylvari already kinda act like a regulator of sorts for race relations.  Not only do they provide a middle ground perspective (due to their being so young), but some like Caithe in the original story actually try to bring important members of the races together in cooperation.
---
Hm...maybe ANet's been playing the long con, all along.  If so, then hats off to 'em.
---
Reaper for basically any PVE farming. You deal good damage but also can't die.
---
There was a chance that the last time it was doing something possible bad due to including a specific library. Nothing was proven, it was just a warning, which got dismissed after source code release + further analyzing.
---
It would certainly require rewriting most aspects of the renderer. Anyone with a shred of understanding of modern APIs know this. 
---
[Here's mine..](https://imgur.com/a/n0JvFl0)
---
As far as we know, Aurene is dead. The ending was poetic, it was a hint. Similar to how telltale games somehow ended their stories on a cliffhanger, so did Anet, which i appreciate a lot! Also episode 6 will be the last episode of season 4, and then were heading straight into season 5. The next expansion will most likely be after season 5. 
---
 "Hey skritts :P" instant upvote XD
---
one time day:  Istan, fractal t4, hot metas ( select amalgamated gemstone) and after: SW to the end
---
However they once did say they wanted to reduce the time between episodes, we're still waiting for that to happen though.
---
&gt;No, there is no expansion coming as far as we know.
---
No official word at any rate. I'd be surprised if we didn't get an x-pac after season 5.
---
Your partner's cousin Steve is visiting with his wife who you know from work, but didn't see until just now, and you trust your partner implicitly so you don't worry about the stability of your imaginary relationship. You hadn't met previously because he's been volunteering with imaginary Medecins sans Frontiers. 
---
Other way around for me. Single Gift of Battle is 6-8 hours of WvW while exploring all base maps is extremely tedious for me. Did it twice and had to force myself to do it a second time.
---
Path of fire did this a little better having the occasional stormy weather. I really do hope they integrate some dynamic weather system though.
---
They said that so long ago, though. You'd think if it was going to actually reduce production time, it would have done so already.
---
&gt; as far as we know
---
HOW should I be able to decide between a washed out gw2 look or worse Performance? Wish reshade and this would work together.
---
Aww too bad I missed this thread yesterday. At the start of the season I was having a terrible time. My matches were awful, players were rude for absolutely no reason, lots of people were complaining about bots, or were bots, or were camping home if they thought the match couldn't be saved.
---
Now that I've done all my placements I've seriously only had good matches. I mean, sure, some people are salty. But most of the time if I greet people and tell them "Good luck, have fun!" I'm met with very positive responses. All my matches have been super close and challenging too, which helps a lot. No one likes getting steamrolled.
---
So, hang in there! May all of your matches be fun and well-matched! 
---
that just gives me more hope thats shes gonna come back ;-;
---
Well, LS5 seems a great time to actually do what they said would happen! I'm too much of an optimist.
---
For real, some people here are so quick to shoot stuff down just because they expect it to be perfect right away.
---
&gt; As far as we know, Aurene is dead.
---
No. If you take time to think about it, leaving emotions behind, what we **know** suggests she's very much alive and coming back soon.
---
I sincerely hope your optimism is justified. :)
---
That would be either Reaper or Guardian for me.
---
Both are very high damage and high survivability classes. 
---
Thanks for the insight. When Win7's support expires, and I bite the bullet for Win10 I will surely go through all those privacy guides and disable the everloving hell out of all the sh*t M$ pushes on the user.
---
&gt; I'm curious to know what options are restricted for you though.
---
I gave Win10 a try when it was first available for free, but I hated how it pushed updates and ads on me. Also the theme settings were more limited than in Win7 as far as I remember, and I really hate the whole Material design :/ (Might be trivial to others, but it's important to me to enjoy the look of something I'm staring at all day.) 
---
I'm talking about the ending of the episode. During the end, she's very much dead. Though we all know she's coming back soon one way or another, she's still currently dead xD
---
Chrono is one of the best solo professions in the Game. Look for Power DPS Chrono (Illusions Dueling, NOT Domination Dueling) The build is not that easy to learn but it sustains quickness, 25 Stacks of might, fury, ~15 stacks vnerabity and still has the standart mesmer benegits like distortion. 
---
For open world i'd drop pDefender for blink/Stability Mantra or Precog
---
There are a lot of videos of Mesmers doing 5 Man content Solo.
---
2019. Players still release tools that Anet should have provided themselves long time ago for free. And even then company has no gratitude to support this lonely hero with their efforts.
---
But I'm not surprised. Most of Anet is working on another game anyway.
---
The music boxes are not really that rare. I farmed all of them, and some took as little as 2 days. 
---
We are all skritt on reddit
---
Hey, fuck, that rhymes
---
If people can develop these add-ons to accomplish this sort of thing......why isn't arenaNet updating the build of the game entirely to do this?   Why not update the game to fully utilize the power of the current day PCs people have?
---
Hello everybody,
---
With Kralkatorrik's new model showing up in episode I thought it would be a great idea to do a side by side of all dragons currently in Guild Wars 2.
---
Enjoy!
---
&gt;The difficulty between the core game and HoT is (imo) massive. 
---
Yes, it is, although it gets easier as you get better. The pocket raptors are a kind of nasty welcome but don't really represent the rest of Heart of Thorns. 
---
&gt;Is it just a case of "git gud"? I
---
Yes, it is, a bit. Don't worry, you will get better. Heart of Thorns maps can be a bit intimidating until you've opened up waypoints and masteries a bit, but stick with it. Verdant Brink is a notoriously hard map for new level 80s. 
---
&gt; Finally, is there a way to tell if hero points are group events?
---
Most of them in the Heart of Thorns maps are. People regularly run "HP trains" - look in the LFG under the zone you're in or ask in /map chat so you can tackle them as a squad. They tend to happen while the meta isn't running, so during the day in Verdant Brink and when the city is open in Auric Basin. 
---
Seems to me that OP is complaining.
---
The ending hit with emotional trick and cliffhanger. But if that wasn't the case, even if commander acted like usual (which means 5 IQ), God's chosen tool Taimi is there and should figure out Aurene is not dead in mere minutes.
---
What is the most braindead/easy to play build in gw2? I enjoy pvp games but having to perfectly time interrupts, dodges, etc is too hard for me for the time being in gw2.
---
Then obvious dbag is obvious. 
---
Do you really expect anybody to help or care, even if you have a point, if you are a douche? But no, keep going around blaming butthurt community member lol

But but, hundreds of very smart gw2 redditors who know a lot about programming told me they would have to rewrite the whole game!
---
Isnt's it lame that the only dragon that we've seen full model so far (and probably ever) is Zhaitan? Rest of dragons is cheap trick of making it a head on a stick. So the only true accomplishment here is, after all these years, still Zhaitan.
---
I think it would be cool if they used the abrupt ending in their favour and actually start the next episode moments after the end of the previous one. ESPECIALLY if the Aurene theory that ends up being true is the Joko one, cause we could be placed at the end and suddenly see Aurene twitch and slowly come to the realisation that, oh shit she's not dead.
---
I love this. Maybe I need to get into crocheting
---
Vlast's model was bigger than Glint? How does that make sense?
---
I mean if they care about storytelling at all, they must start next episode right where this one ended. However... since probably season 1, our real time movement is the same as in Tyria. So next episode is literally happening 3 months after Aurene's "death". Unless they change it.
---
I'm taller than my father.
---
It could be Alacrity or Quickness but not both. We don't need Chrono 2.0.
---
On the PvP side of things Scrapper is (almost) viable but I've still yet to seen any other scrappers other than myself in Ranked.
---
The almost perma 15% damage boost (With Sanctuary runes+Rapid Regeneration) and interactions with Kinetic Stabilizers added some big 1v1+ cheese to an already defensive class. 
---
And I do agree that the entire class is having an identity crisis. Anet is generally afraid of putting too much defensive or supportive abilities on a single class in fear of ChronoTank days. They much prefer more 'proactive' playstyles like the Kinetic Stabilizers trait.
---
A more simple change (Until they rework combo fields) is a Trait that modifies you fields to pulse out boons or grant unique effects like condi cleanse from poison fields. 
---
While the backslash was hard at first, it is needed for such software. I actually like that we have people being critical and suspicious to examine it so thoroughly in order to make sure its fine. The harder its inspected at first, the safer it is for the average user. Malware can destroy so much in your life, don't take it lightly.
---
Yea i agree, really do hope they change that but i wouldn't be mad if they didn't as long as the reason for doing so is valid. After such a big loss i feel as though we need a direct continuation.
---
I believe a dev did confirm that they wanted to bookend this episode with dead dragon allies. Glint at the start, Aurene at the end.
---
In PvE? Power Reaper.
---
In PvP? Power Reaper.
---
In WvW? Pick any meta backline/buffing class and join a zerg.
---
What I'm afraid the most is... We begin with another Taimi walkie talkie convo stating "Commander... It's about Aurene... We need to talk" and then we get story instance with a dialogue about how something's wrong and why Taimi expects she survived... And then we go to the mists and bring her back to her body, stronger because duh, it's gandalf the white. And boom, that's it, no more talking just moving on with the story to new map.
---
I tried installing it, but there's something I'm doing wrong apparently, I did read the readme, it just says to download the latest release and extract it in your GW2 folder and I did that, but it doesn't seem to do anything.  I downloaded two different ZIPs and I tried the master ZIP too, but nothing.    
---
I do have windows 10 and my GPU supports d12 so it should work? 
---
The six left us.  He's doing Snargle Gutslurper's work.
---
I was under the impression, I guess, that Vlast was not full grown.
---
//s
---
Here.  You dropped this.
---
When the dragons are larger than an average GW2 map, you kinda have to restort to only showing their head, sadly...
---
Thanks man. I'll also probably try to record videos for other classes if I ever figure out how to play them xD
---
If i were the OP i would just tell ppl to fuck off after what happened. The community doesn't deserve his code.
---
This. I don't necessarily like having to speak to Taimi at the start of every single episode. I get what they're trying to do, but i would enjoy it more as one big cohesive story that just continues. Having the 3 month gap everytime feels a little awkward. It's not healthy imo. 
---
Map comp is the easy part. The
---
Gifts of fortune are the true nemesis
---
The issue with skill-split, is that a few months down the road the patch notes always read 'unsplit'. For whatever reason, Anet seems to think that splitting a skill is a way to test which works best, and not a way to keep the modes seperate in how skills/traits work in order to truly balance classes and specs.
---
What we do know suggests she had several means available to her to persist, but the episode itself stressed the fact that she should be considered dead (for the time being) by introducing a "branded" Caithe who visually loses her connection to Aurene, and she confirms this loss with what she says. She's very much dead, but Guild Wars has time and time again just shown what a poor obstacle death seems to be. I think the next episode will at the very least focus on restoring her death to a non-death state.
---
I'd hate to be the guy actually wanting her to be *dead* dead, but I mean, from the beginning Charr tutorial to a literal envoy of from the dead that included Eir and Snaff in the previous episode to the dead popping out in this one, things aren't looking good for that guy, and they really shouldn't be basing their hopes on a trait Guild Wars 2 has consistently dismissed :p I mean, who comes back from the dead after their body has been completely pummeled without the barest trace of your typical undead aftereffects?
---
Yep, but Reshade must reflect GW2 calls to Proxy correctly. And Reshade should use same approach to DX9 as GW2, to be more shure.
---
You're getting downvoted for asking a question, tf is wrong with this subreddit
---
In the rest of the world not everything has to be a weapon. ^^/s
---
Good writers would keep her dead but its guaranteed with next episode we gonna experience gandalf the white moment.
---
Also, she didnt blew up which is enough of a proof of her return.
---
The fact that I can read the source code and did..
---
Man I never realized Xemnas invaded Tyria too.
---
Maybe it's coming Tuesday , it actually matches the WvW Obsidian weapons !
---
We had an Elder Dragon present. It could easily have sucked up all the energy before such an explosion would happen. 
---
Or an even simpler explanation: She used up all her energy during the battle, and thus there where nothing left to actually explode her. 
---
I did that, now i'm getting (frame_analizer)  P7 init error
---
That implies something different. We *know* that it's highly likely that there will be a new xpac sometime after season 5. I wanted to add my piece because otherwise it can be read to mean that GW2 wont be getting another xpac at all.
---
well they're either going to have to do that, or make gw3 otherwise the performance will still be shit no matter how good hardware gets. 
---
Her body would disintegrate. But it didnt .
---
Yet. 
---
p.s. the most long uptime running d912pxy for me was \~270min.
---
There’s not a traditional DPS/H/T trinity, but there are roles.  I would consider the 4 PvE roles to be:
---
1) DPS: all 9 classes have a viable endgame DPS build.  
---
2) Boon and Buff support.  The rockstars of this role are Warrior with their banners and Chronomancer with their alacrity/quickness.  Guardians can upkeep a lot of minor boons solo, and Revenant/Guardian are becoming a viable duo to replace Chronomancers.
---
3) Healers.  Druid has always been the popular healer choice, but ANet has been trying to reduce their monopoly.  Healing elementalists are viable for some bosses, and healing scrapper is fringe viable now.
---
4) Boss Mechanic roles.  Some raid bosses want a tank (usually a chrono). Others want someone who can soak up damage (“Hand Kiter” Revenant). There’s a few niche things out there like this.  These builds aren’t useful outside of very specific encounters.
---
As a side note, you also need reliable crowd control for most bosses, but that can come from any of the above roles, but I wouldn’t consider it a role itself. Some builds are better for it than others.
---
In Raids, every boss requires DPS, Boon Support, and Healing.  It’s also the only place you really need some boss mechanic roles.
---
In fractals, you tend to want some boon support and DPS, but healers have fallen out of the meta.
---
In Zerg metas, DPS is important, but support classes are really handy for metas that occasionally fail.
---
Same thing happened to me too. Felt weird as hell as I had left the screen for couple of minutes
---
I really hate how the story revolves around only human like in the PoF it’s a human god and a whole continent filled with only humans in LWS4 it fo
---
Spelling aside hahaha
---
We don't have the traditional roles... we have a soft ish kind of role system (trinity) where certain classes as able to fill certain roles traditional meant for other classes.
---
Well, one of the two lighthouses seen in the game was continuously spewing fire, not having the inside of its mouth lit up like the concept art. The other one (which is on the wiki) wasn't, but that might have just been a graphics choice - Bejunkan Pier's lighthouse is further out and in fog, whereas the one in Port Kaimu is almost on the shoreline.
---
So it would only not be seen from behind, really, which was mostly shoreline for both I think.
---
What do you base all this on? You seem to state your opinions as actual fact, but what do you base it on? Zhaitan didn't disintegrate when it was defeated. Nor did Mordremoth. So why would must she in order to prove that she is dead?
---
And IF she does, it is almost certainly because of the power within her, which would be nullified by both of my suggestions. 
---
We don't *know* anything of the sort. The only thing we know is that there is no Expansion coming directly after Season 4, and that expansion-level systems will now be released as part of the non-expansion updates. The end.
---
Here's an idea: have both of you train 9 new raiders in a squad on Wing 1.
---
We both know who has the higher chance of success, and it's not the guy who's getting frustrated with new people. When I was getting into raiding I went and joined on the trainings of one of the big training discords on VG. It took a very long time to actually kill him and multiple times you could hear the commander being audibly frustrated. After a while I just stopped joining them and went to a different guild's trainings - and they were so, so much better. The commander was patient, they explained things, and guess what? Boss kills were much more common, even one-shotting tough bosses for new raiders like Sloth and Matthias. 
---
It really speaks volumes. You can't, and shouldn't, expect new players to be good instantly. Rotations on the golem? Sorry - I don't learn well, If I have to do in bosses, I learn them much better, it actually matters there as opposed to forgetting the rotation 5 mins after I left the golem because the Golem doesn't matter. I, and I imagine many others, actually need *apply* that rotation somewhere. Learning by doing it, as some would say. Bosses like MO are perfect for this because they are so easy. Samarog is also easy, although an inexperienced squad might not have grasped the need for CC. Back to the point though, it's also often expressed that golem rotations aren't necessarily the rotations you can or should do on some bosses - often you will need to *adapt* your rotation to the mechanics. There's no point in wasting DPS cooldowns on Sloth while he's invulnerable, for example.
---
Honestly, all I say you need is a *proper squad composition.* Do that, and the chance of squad success goes up a lot. 2x Chrono, 1x Druid, 1x Scourge Healer (because new people! It's imperative they stay alive so they *learn* the mechanics, yes you can argue this carries them and teaches them to stand in, but dead people don't learn as much), 1x BS, 5x DPS; changes depending on: at least 2x condi DPS for VG, doesn't matter for Gorse and Sab. Have one DPS assigned to each cannon so as many people learn them as possible. Alternate every wipe so everyone learns. Same for Sloth shrooms. Suggest people use what works well for each boss if they have it: Holosmith is good all-purpose, Daredevil/Deadeye work well on a lot of bosses while being simple, SB^3 and Scourge are very easy to play as condi DPS. 
---
(What happened to the movement a while back that realised some people perform better on classes with simpler rotations as opposed to the higher dps but much more complicated rotations like Weavers and Renegades?)
---
Thank you so much, just wanted to say that
---
I'm sorry your imaginary relationship is so rocky. 
---
Dr?
---
I hope your dps is better than your trash talk.

[Zhaitan's original model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rS8Z5oB3N0bWeiPabIQErYaPXqcQ4aCw/view) wasn't so bad in terms of size. IIRC, they shrunk him down because fighting something so large was beyond the scale of their tech at the time. Image made by Vyko, who made the size comparison images that're on the GW2W atm.
---
Personally, I consider his canonical size, compared to the other ED, that of his original, incomplete, model.
---
[Vyko's attempt to make Zhaitan's original mode a tad more complete](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M5YiQQs2_ozMmfjKRAXeH-mG5-i8ksKa/view)
---
No, he just absorbed their magic, that's all 
---
Can someone explain how do i instal this do i over write bin64 and instal the dx9prxy in foldr or what im lost
---
Well, they were to eat magic, but at a more moderate rate than the Elder Dragons. However, to stand a chance against the Elder Dragons, Glint, Vlast, and Aurene would need to eat a bunch of magic at first.
---
It's not that simple. Only [some](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/fileio/naming-a-file#maximum-path-length-limitation) functions have this limitation lifted, and even then only under some conditions. ``GetSystemDirectory`` is not part of these, and even if it were, the new behavior must be opted into.
---
As I said, Windows prioritizes backwards compatibility. Suddenly allowing extended paths in programs using old functions would be a major security risk.
---
The funny thing about Scourges is that Anet could just make the Scourge just not count as a shade with that trait and it would easily fix that issue. They can either nuke the group or hump the shade, but not control as much space as they do currently.
---
The reason people push 'buff over nerf' is because you want to promote options for counter-play. Nerfing almost never does this because it just removes things from viability most the time. Nerfing spellbreakers didn't improve the meta, if anything it made it worse by taking a big check out of the food chain.
---
yea iirc(was long ago) the bosses had arguably interesting mechanics too..could be easily made into a dungeon path but why make repeatable content that can be enjoyed over and over when you can spend months on 30min never-again things
---
The part of me that enjoys absurdity wants Bubbles to be the size of a goldfish but still as powerful as an Elder Dragon. The battle ends when the Commander contains him inside an enchanted highball glass.
---
Condi holo also
---
whelp; I'd be less surprised if the next *legend* allows Revenants to have 3 legends instead of two legends; with independent instead of a legend swap they get an independent legend cooldown (F1-F3 for the legends)
---
I think the visual was moreso to show how ridiculously overpowered Kralkatorrik has become; Mordremoth (the last elder dragon we *fought*) didn't show much in terms of having acquired skills from Zhaitan's Domain; we didn't see any clear influences that until we got the Death- &amp; Vine-Touched Destroyers in LS3.
---
I mean you literally see both in game. Vlast in PoF story, and Glint in the most recent LW chapter.
---
Zhaitan was originally supposed to be much bigger, but I always like the idea of how he looked like several dragons melted together.
---
Yes, on max FPS effect is not that big, but not 0.
---
[It shows up on mine screen](https://imgur.com/a/epNfawC)
---
[Relevant discussion](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/66630/kralkatorriks-new-size-renders-and-comparison#latest), Vyko pulled out the same model and we noticed some oddities with it. Mainly that Anet devs said the new model is larger than his old, but the one you two pulled out are larger. Also that unlike other models, Vyko couldn't get a proper texture on it. The chin is also proportionately smaller than in-game. Lastly, it's very different from the render shown on Guild Chat ([image for reference](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/5/58/Kralkatorrik_render.jpg)).
---
Which has made some of us wonder if that model was the "temporary placeholder" to see if Kralk would fit, rather than the final product.
---
Your thoughts?
---
That is ok then, it is a non issue realistically.
---
How much time goes into making a legendary?
---
Casuals has destroyed every gaming genre out there unfortunately
---
what's up with all of these facebook uncle level shitposts lately?
---
I agree, I have both but I prefer my Firebrand over Reaper, I find it easier to tag mobs with (Scepter/F1) and it has nearly unlimited condi cleanse and stun break with Mantras (good to have in Istan).
---
Any holosmith build, meta soulbeast, or condition mirage.
---
No they arent because pof has its own GH just like it has its own set of elite specs. There are no HoT mounts.
---
I agree! 
---
**Foremost Scourge is the problem**. It's completely broken and in a league of its own. Revenant only supplements the playstyle Scourge dictates and some form of Guardian has always been set because it has the monopoly on reliable group stability (not that it's a good thing though...).
---
The issue is that boon corruption is king. And Scourge has so much more of it than any other class. All of it in large AoEs plus a good amount of damage on top, support and decent sustain. They will remain absolutely broken and negate melee when stacked until they see **big** nerfs to that aspect.
---
* **Sand Savant**: reduced to 3 enemy targets, still 5 allied targets
---
* **Devouring Darkness**: reduced to 2 boons corrupted on 3 targets in 300 radius, cooldown increased to 12 sec
---
* **Unholy Feast**: reduced to 3 targets within 300 radius, reduced cast speed to 3/4 sec to compensate
---
* **all Punishment skills**: boon corruption reduced to 3 targets (Trail of Anguish only corrupts on the initial trigger)
---
**Reducing the number of targets on boon corrupts is key for fixing Scourge in WvW**, without hampering its capabilities in sPvP too much. Maybe then corrupting every boon of every engaging player with ez spam wouldn't be possible anymore and you'd need to actually focus your corrupts. And maybe it'd enable coordinated melee pushes onto the Scourge train...
---
Cant wait to see Jormag and Bubbles on that sheet. But i also think Primordus is allways going to be the biggest of them all
---
This is why I've always been disappointed they went with the elder dragons as the big bads. It's also impossible for me to connect with them as villains because of their large size. 
---
&gt; (match these pieces THERE'S NOTHING TO MATCH WITH)
---
There is something to match with; the piece you're holding (/\) has an icon on it that matches the little v that it slots into. for the circle icons; there's a faint glow / sparkle at the location you drop it in
---
These are some nice fps inprovements! 
---
Anyone got some experience in running this with multiple GPUs?

Surprised this isn't archived, was hoping this was a thing as i'm attempting to avoid the branded crystals in Beast of War atm
---
People are right to be sceptical considering malware can destroy you financially. Any complex, free software without source code should set off massive alarm bells.
---
I would love a poly count of each as well. Be interesting to see how much more they're able to render compared to release.
---
Clearly it's the best these people know
---
That it would probably just be an accurate representative of the overall population.
---
**Guild hall functionality** is bound to HoT. Happy now that I had to make it astoundingly specific? 
---
Here's a stupid question. Since they already have to use OpenGL on the mac port, is there any reason they couldn't just use something like Angle?
---
It may actually be worse than doing nothing.
---
When there are so many blatant issues with PvP which have lingered for years, doing a ToL with official fanfare can promote an idea of "ANet doesn't get it."  And that discouraging idea will in turn cause people on the fence - and there are likely a lot - to quit.
---
So manual updates, or completely different programs as it evolves and improves through community support? 
---
Realistically since the Special Forces Training Area in the Aerodrome shows you your current DPS every 20% of the golem HP, as long as you hit a good number on that, you should be able to transition it into a boss fight and know that you're doing good even if you can't see it in an actual raid.
---
If you constantly down to every mechanic the raid has though, thats why DPS meters are a thing. At its core it shows how good everyone is at their rotation, at a more indepth look it shows how good each player is at transitioning their golem rotation to dealing with mechanics + their rotation.
---
DPS meters aren't really required either, if you don't care about other peoples DPS, just play Druid or Chrono and you won't really need to care about yours that much or at all in pugs.
---
There's no traditional signup or info as with previous tourneys so it's pretty safe to say it will be within the AT system.
---
No T1, T4. 
---
They've always told us when an episode was a season finale. This wasn't said for All or Nothing.
---
Changed out all the sigils. Thanks for the for advice!
---
T1-3 exist for those who find T4 too difficult. 
---
wasnt this mainly about dx11?
---
Wow I really want to try this out! Thanks for all your hard work and passionate dedication. Does this clash with Overwolf and SweetFX? What is the devs stand point on this?
---
Why can't you just PM the OP instead? xd
---
First Elder Dragon to wake up, the Elder Fire Dragon, who creates the destroyers. We saw his head in the finale-yet-not-a-finale episode of Season 3 (aka Flashpoint).
---
I freehanded most of it, I had a pattern that I found but it was incredibly badly written. 
---
I did a large increase spiral (so started with 12 stitches in a ring, then DC in each, then alternating DC and 2 DC in each stitch for 2 rounds, then DC, DC, 2 DC for a round). The pattern I found had it connecting each round and I didn't want a seam. If you work in a spiral, put a stitch marker where you begin each round to see where it is.
---
For the sides, I just stopped increasing, did 3 rounds of 1 DC in each stitch. The drawstring holes are DC, ch2, skip 1 DC, repeat. Then I went around one last time and did 3 SCs in each ch2 space to make it look nicer.
---
The drawstring is just a chain that I then did SCs in each stitch, and then slip stitches in each, thread it through the holes and sewed them together in a loop. 
---
ah I still need to play the HoT and lws3 story, so that's why
---
I expect that if we see him again and fight Primordus, he's gonna shrink like [Kralkatorrik did](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RHHXUEUp3pbXQ3KqTVTf4VrXf9BgYonm/view).
---
Honestly [it gets to a point where the world is the table](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10toYJE77NMuDYY8PIf0OQ1b1EBXefSMG/view).
---
It was pretty easy to make, but you'll need to know a couple of tricks. I posted what I did on another comment but if you don't know how to crochet it won't make a lot of sense. I do love to crochet though! It's very relaxing to me.
---
In the recent GuildChat, they showed a different render of Kralkatorrik than the one that\_shaman and Vyko ([on official forums](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/66630/kralkatorriks-new-size-renders-and-comparison)) found, which has at least one wing and shoulders seen: [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/66630/kralkatorriks-new-size-renders-and-comparison](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/66630/kralkatorriks-new-size-renders-and-comparison)
---
So we may be getting to see more of Kralkatorrik soon^(tm).
---
This is the mask: [https://i.imgur.com/f7q80jU.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/f7q80jU.jpg) 
---
Kralkatorrik's old model had roughly 23.9K polygons, the new one has about 157.2K. [Side by side I did earlier this week](https://imgur.com/jeEMUr1).
---
What rating?
---
Thanks!  Maybe my browser plugins are screwing up the page.
---
Yes I know that. Played osrs while ago and now on break because gw taking all my time again lol
---
Everything up to PoF, but not much Living Story past it.  I have not even beaten PoF's story yet because I'm not really inspired to play single player stuff if there isn't any multiplayer stuff to look forward to.
---
I wonder if those are edible. They look delicious. 
---
Ahh I see. Thanks for the explanation.
---
How do you think I should gear for a beginner?
---
I didn't know anything about repairing but had this same issue about two years ago. Reinstall fixed it
---
Scrapper was originally and advertised as a brucer like spec. Good damage and sustain + defence to survive  longer than average dps classes. I'd rather see them bring that back than to make scrapper a support spec and jump between all kinds of spec ideas with no actual synergy or build depth.
---
The absolutly worst trait on the whole engineer class atm is [Shocking Speed](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shocking_Speed) and we don't need more trash traits like it. Especially now that they've removed most of the lightning fields on scrapper anyway.  Take your suggestion for Decisive Renown for example, our only leaps are on rifle and hammer, and you can't use both at the same time. Similar problem with Whirl finishers where we only got them on hammer and shredder gyro. This does not promote build diversity and build craft, it limits to one specific settup so much that it might as well just mention the skills like  [Perfectly Weighted](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Perfectly_Weighted) does.
---
So basically Primordius could easilly bite Kralks head?
---
Then Let's drag Kralk into Draconis Mons, make Primordius go there again and easy kill of Kralk XD
---
I did not answer your analogy because it had nothing to with anything. Either way at this point i kind of regret i spent time answer you at all because you turned in to some childish competition that i can not even begin to relate too and and have nothing to do with anything so i drop the subject and wish you a happy game evening.
---
My take on it could be due to few reasons. This is of course merely speculation. 
---
1. We've seen a post by the anet dev stating that graphics isnt the bottleneck, and that improving in this area wouldnt yield much difference. They were sort of right in that I dont think this improves max fps much. But they were mostly wrong as you see stats by OP. So they may have chosen not to invest time and money into this believing it is not worth the effort. I believe this has the greatest impact.
---
2. They may have tried already and failed. Maybe they couldn't get it to work stably. And was taking up too much time from their dev team. They could have not announced to prevent false hype. 
---
3. They simply may not have someone as good as OP in their dev team for this. Good being defined as skills required to do this and the effort being put in to it. "People" on the internet is a large mass. The possibility that he's simply smarter than the graphics programmer working in anet is there. 
---
4. Seeing this, anet may finally choose to approach this, having seen a working concept. Maybe OP will even be invited. Who knows...
---
Holy cow that's beautiful.
---
That's a quote from Diddy King in dk64
---
d912pxy is a wrapper. 
---
Reshade hooks the d3d9 dll and it makes directx9 calls. At least I assume that. 
---
Now redirect those tho d912pxy and it could work. 
---
If they change nothing at all, and just add the "final boss" encounter from the story require 5 people with more hp and dmg (for better scaling) on a replay button then we go back to all the things i said in my previous reply.
---
Story steps can already be played with 1-5 players, and they can be replayed.
---
I see better ways for devs to spend their resources than giving us the ability to ignore the entire episode, in order to fight the last boss with 5 people over and over again.
---
They could instead focus on more sought out for things such as:
---
* Actual raids
---
* New fractals
---
* WvW alliance
---
* A new expansion
---
Im not saying it wouldnt be fun to go to dragons stand and shout "LFG&gt;Daily modry boss fight, lets get some machetes !" , or fight cool living world "bosses" with a group of people for some extra minor rewards. Im just being real here
---
People are right to be skeptical, they are not right to say things like:
---
It has keylogger (like a fact, in a mod post out of all.)
---
It had russian readme so guy is probably russian that is a big red flag.
---
General fear mongering
---
Clueless idiots spamming everyone to change their pw and shit.
---
Probably could make the list longer but you get the point. The people that said..hey it has this .dll and that function that *could* be a potential risk did nothing wrong, people that took that and turned it into a bitch-show however...yeaaaa let's not pretend that was right.

In same thread he got called out for being both defensive, offensive, wanting to take the night off even! Him saying it is late he'll go sleep (probably after working hard to finally push it to a releasable state) was the perfect thing to do - he calmed and made better decisions. But no, THAT was a red flag too.
---
I hope people learn from last night instead of patting on each other's back.
---
God help us with Krakatorik then.

But arcdps is closed source, how can you trust it? It probably has keylogger in it, change your pw asap!
---
Mine stopped working and it to anet 2 days to unlink so I could actually play. I don't want to do it again
---
Y'know, I may have been looking at thr wrong thing.
---
how many kasmeers is primordus 
---
Ha,
---
incomming long and pointless explainer,
---
The only reason I said what I did is because, I remember online gaming as a child on my parrent's dial-up playing the original CS and Asheron's Call.
---
As a sheltered minority with well-off parrents it was shocking to see how mean, awful, rude, and blatently racist people were.
---
Having been really into online gaming my entire life my experience in the that it's better now than it was then. I might be wrong but, I can go a few matches without the negativity/toxicity we all hate showing up.
---
I can play the PvE side without seeing any at all.
---
Even in the worst environments, like Overwatch, I can get a few games in a row where people aren't constantly at eachother's throats.
---
So as pointless as this rant was, Anyone who stumbles across it, All I am trying to say is this:
---
It will likely always be there. When you have the type of disconnected interface that a computer provides, you are going to get the ugliest sides of people unleashing the full spectrum of negativity. But, I think it has toned down over time.
---
Is harder in the beginning, will get worst on the 3rd HoT map tho ... for the HPs, Verdant has the easiest ones imo, with few exceptions, I did them following an youtube video, but on the next maps most of the HPs are group events because of the champions, but there are plenty of HP trains, just keep checking often.  To know which HPs are group event, check the wiki if needed.

i dont understand what my comment has to do with trust issues
---
It's Sindrener, so probably around bronze.
---
Good writers keep their thematic components cohesive. It makes no sense for death to suddenly become insurmountable in Aurene's case, specially when you now have two episodes illustrating how weak the barrier between the living and the dead has become.
---
Whether she blew up or not is likely a matter of whether they wanted to make her death violent or wanted to work up to the much heralded slow reveal of her death.
---
I'm not debating whether she will return or not. I think it's obvious she will, in some form or another, and, like other players, have my own theory on that. I'm just not going to keep on posting it again and again, because I'd be the flip side of the people who seem to want Aurene dead so much they will karmatroll the comments :p
---
Yep, just because you don't like my opinion doesn't really impact me, so enjoy your haughty opinion of my opinion.
---
Try to update drivers and check d912pxy/pck folder rw access, and ofc be shure that there is no tonn of background tasks. Water should load in the end. 
---
TIL that p much every single form of instanced pve content is '1 instance of PvE'.
---
It's fun to watch WvW mains be so dramatic about this. Not like WvW/PvP nerfs ever affected PvE or anything. /s
---
So how do I know its working? I installed it and noticed no difference
---
Power Reaper in pvp? I'm still tripping over my GS. Yes I know I'm not supposed to use it, but why does my pew pew Shroud 1 suddenly turn to Stomp--ack no I meant to GS2, ugg guy it already dead, now theirs a huge cool down.
---
Codes been audited. This current release is safe. Can't talk about future releases but currently. It's open source we can make sure there's nothing fishy in it. OP so long as he stays legit should be worshipped for dropping this open source, it's so rare and thankless. OP from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. I did a tiny bit of programing a while back and realize how shitty it might be to make a badass Lego castle. Then put the schematic out there for the world to see. 
---
Just shows how few shits ANet gives more than anything.  
---
Thank you, I understand completely what you're talking about. I hope one day,  people in this community will be accepting of all game modes 
---
Yes on both. You don't need to complete the Heart of Thorns elite specialisation to do the PoF Elite specialisation.
---
As a fairly casual player in fine with your idea as long as the single player version is at the current difficulty. 
---
Thief (and Ranger) are literally the most useless classes for zergs. They provide nothing another class can't do better. 
---
1. you should see general bug with character portraits
---
2. P7logs folder in game root folder with logs in it
---
i wished ANet picked this up (with OP authorization, ofc) and adapted it for everyone in an official update.
---
Unlikely as far as we know Rytlock is the first revenant. Also I doubt the dragons are specific professions.

Yeah OP this is really cool stuff! I'm getting a really significant FPS boost, going from 20-30 to a smooth 30 FPS in Lion's Arch on GTX 970 SLI 2160p (I understand it's Vsync locked).  I'm really excited to use this fulltime once the rough edges are smoothed out!
---
&gt; It had russian readme so guy is probably russian that is a big red flag.
---
That statement says more about you than anything else.
---
Cringe.
---
It’s happening to quite a lot of people though 
---
Many people are suddenly getting this problem, this is either a coincidence or it's not a fault on their end :P
---
This is very exciting, my potato from 2013 badly needs some help, any help it can get.
---
It has logged [11000 hours in GW2](https://imgur.com/a/3DJx4Cn) though, it's a trooper!
---
Im actually surprised that people even get ego boosted by a mode where it has not even half of the community engaged, since most ppl do PvE, so I really dont care about them either
---
Calm down you crazy skritt.
---
Yeah, considering GW2 came out in 2012(?) Im not surprised that the model was too large/complex/whatnot
---
I get 12FPS in new maps and WvW on my potato. I'm very interested.
---
With how the dragons seem to just get bigger and bigger, I rather hope that Bubbles is back on the smaller side of things again. :)
---
Would the 3 gods be that good, and the rest trash if the gameplay of wvw changed into something different than blobbing up and moving as one as you crash into another blob?
---
Would adding other sorts of objectives and had more impact on the team score, local area ,and the borders in general that would be more rewarding to do than blobbing with necros and guardians?
---
Isn't he loosely designed after Chinese dragons? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_dragon

Hi! Moron here, So for the instillation I just need to grab the d912pxy folder(extracted) and place it into the Main Gw2 Game folder like so? [https://imgur.com/8mRqn0U](https://imgur.com/8mRqn0U)  
---
Seeing all these replies kinda like “Whats wrong playing for fun” if you go for T4 dailies, CMs or raids, you know what you are getting yourself into, dont bring your “for fun” attitude when people want to clear and move on withouth wasting too much time. Everyone can have fun, yes, but dont be stupid either.
---
This “I play for fun” mentality is as annoying as the “tryhard” mentality depending on what you’re about to do
---
Thank you! I finally figured it out, although my game is showing almost a negative color gradient, even while trying to apply the fix in github. I just log into the game and it appears like that. Will post in github
---
I found the necromancer a good cheese. 
---
Get your necroid bar full, fight the group 5 spiders in the ruins below the forge until your below 10% health. 
---
After then, enter, and stay in shroud, and never get out of combat. Kill as many spiders as it takes, although the group of 5 'should' suffice
---
You have to cheat it. 
---
Necromancer shroud will lock your HP at its current, just get it below 10% and kill 5 enemies without getting out of the shroud or combat. 
---
The spiders in the ruins below the forge are sufficiently weak
---
So... you guys recruiting?
---
Will this work if my gpu only supports directx11?
---
I thought it was called Steve 
---
I don’t know that we can say the same, or really anything at all, about the gender dimorphism of Elder Dragon champions or their progeny. 
---
Then there should be a gemstore item to add that dragon to the legendary shield 
---
Some idiot dev from anet came on reddit in the past to tell us that newer versions of directx would not net any fps gains. Where is that coward now?
---
I imagine primordus is like a burrowing volcanic mountain. I wonder if we could do that with him? I doubt we could with the rest though
---
That's one thing I really miss after playing BDO. Just chilling somewhere and it starts raining, little puddles everywhere and your character soaked in water.  
---
Yeah...the meta was actually pretty fun when mesmer, scrapper, and spellbreaker were still good.  Now it's basically optimal to just stack Firebrands, Scourges, and Revs as 90% of the group, then have maybe an Ele, Mes, Spellbreaker sprinkled in.

Interesting. For those still stuck on FX this might be something interesting to try out. If you're on Windows 10 and have a DX12 card which most people should might be better to try or wait for the DX9-12 mod. 
---
One other thing. FX really isn't a modern high end CPU at all anymore. Last FX processor was 2014 and every Intel processor since then has pretty much destroyed FX. Anyone still running a FX should seriously upgrade their PC as soon as they are able to Ryzen or Intel if you want to switch sides. I upgraded in 2016 from an FX-8350 to a Ryzen 5 1600X and saw massive improvements on every game. Games that used to struggle to hit 1080/60/max hit it without any issues or even taxing the processor. Even Guild Wars 2, on the 8350 drops to 10-15 FPS were common. With Ryzen, only see drops under 30 FPS in zergs with tons of particle effects and that's still with settings on maxed. Play most of the game between 45 and 100 FPS. 
---
To be fair, it was more than "kinda effective" in WvW.  It was extremely good and probably needed a slight nerf.  But I agree, they don't know what to do with WvW.  Honestly they don't even play it.  I see an Anet employee once in a blue moon, and who knows if they actually have any effect on game balance.  I know they also stream, but 5 devs playing once a week during EU hours is not enough to understand the game.
---
Sounds cool but I guess my lack of 16gb RAM(only have 8) is causing my game to crash within 3 minutes of launch so I can't test it. Is there a chance to improve it enough to not require so much?
---
No it does not - any time soon. It's "Pre-Alpha" software released early for testing purposes.
---
Man this sub is so nice compared to /r/classicwow if you even remotely say anything against the hive mind there you get down voted to oblivion 
---
The performance/engine people did a huge re-code between launch and HoT due to some really bad decisions during original development as far as how levels were managed and able to be modified causing lots of production delays. Post HoT they have spent a majority of their energy on pulling anything they can off of the main render thread. This had lead to a considerable increase in CPU utilization on multi-core machines. At launch 2-3 cores were about all that was consistently used, now it'll thrash a quad-core machine and even my 6C12T laptop hits a solid 60% even if per-core performance is still the main bottleneck.
---
So it is likely that 4 years ago when devs said that an API change wouldn't be all that good, it wouldn't have been, but now the API is the biggest bottleneck, so we can see real improvement.
---
Given OP's replies, no, if person can't get criticism and then gets defensive about obvious things (releasing source code) then they shouldn't release it for a large number of people.
---
What he could say about releasing source code is: 
---
&gt;I'm bad at git so it will take few days till I learn how to use and then post it, use at your own risk. 
---
And the logger could be explained as he needed logs after crashes and they all logged LOCALLY straight away.
---
This way people would've had less suspicions and some who don't trust it would just wait a day or another to test it out.
---
Backlash was needed.
---
Prior to the open source release there was no reason not to question things.
---
That's why I max out graphics on 4k and just reduce player count or whatever. Seems to have not much effect on framerate but at least the game looks alright.
---
Something is not right then as I'm on a 1600X at 3.8Ghz and my FPS almost never drops below 30 and most of the game is played between 45-100 FPS. Same speed ram, game on SSD, and a EVGA GTX 1060 6GB SC.
---
That's not the whole reason either. The evades is the reason the "Tank" can take less vitality. High toughness with no more health doesn't mean much for effective hp.
---
I agree on this one
---
It's not even boon rip, it's the boon corrupt.  It's insanely strong.  Just compare it to Spellbreaker which was supposed to be a class built around ripping boons.  Why even play a spellbreaker at this point?  The amount of strips cannot even come close to keeping pace with a scourge strip.  Then you factor in that a scourge also turns those stripped boons into conditions, and it's a no-brainer.  
---
I don't. Anet should bake this into the engine. But again, unless there is a significant number of drawcalls, this isn't going to make much of a difference for "higher" end machines (which could be back to the 7xx/9xx series nVidia GPUs).
---
DX12/Vulkan are great for net-new (because why not?) but the performance increase helps more so with lower end hardware rather than high end hardware.
---
MMOs like GW2 also will have framerate issues due to client sync between server and client. Not much you can do about that.
---
Downvoting and replying to this thread took me less time than the OP did making it.
---
Drawcalls being limited to a single cpu thread was always going to be a fps bottleneck, anets respnses were always carefully worded to dismiss the generalised request but not address the reality.
---
They probably just don't have the sort of manpower free / budget for it. Which is fair i guess, it isn't a huge game.
---
Power Reaper with vampirism runes could probably be one of the best general open-world specs you can build.
---
RAM requirements will change along the way

We need the .bat(s) back. It was too easy to enable/disable clean shaders and such with them.
---
So long as spectators wouldn't be allowed to chat with the players I think it'd be nice. Sometimes I just want to sip some coffee and watch 10 players get destroyed.
---
i had this happen in a low level dungeon with low level people i was trying to help through coming from the only other level 80 besides me. just takes one to ruin the group.
---
can everyone now spectate pvp? I thought only chosen ppl can.
---
the problem with spectating is, that the devs said that every spectator is actually loading in the map and when there would watch some hundred ppl a group playing raids/fractals it would be a slide show.
---
(could be wrong, but thats the last update I have on spectating. at least in pvp. maybe something changed in the mean time)
---
Save your eyes and don't use a white wallpaper :D
---
Then again, there were reasons to keep some secrecy (call it what you want) about ep5. I dunno, I don't really care either way because that doesn't change much, y'know?

I don't get it. Is this an "I'm an asshole" comment? Do you want some discussion? If so, about what point?

Wow. I was thinking the golem would just be provided by asura npcs but I definitely like the thought you put into all this! We definitely need a golem mount at some point and I love the mastery ideas, akin to the roller beetle walls that can be crashed through (:

---
you should get all of that s*it out of your fans maybe first and maybe put some better thermal paste on your CPU/GPU since the standards ones are often equal to toothpaste (if you can't do it yourself you could search for someone who can)
---
Serious respect from me to be honest, after that backlash I sure as well wouldn't be this nice...
---
To be fair I get 25-35 FPS at events, cities ect. roaming around open world with not many people its 50-70. But regardless... 
---
I have ryzen 2600 and a 1060 6gb I get 60fps soloing 35 in huge zergs. I did have a 6300fx before and it was just utter shite.
---
since when do we classify the mouth of mordremoth as mordremoth? The asura who made this must have flunked his studies
---
Really interested in how the performance increased, can you list your build and what changes you witnessed? Cant test this until Monday, sadly. 
---
Someone at anet will see this, spit out his coffee and assemble the entire team just to launch an emergency patch to remove Bond of Fate from griffon.
---
Too many people believing the Russian boogey man narrative mainstream media is pushing nowdays.
---
Thanks
---
GW2 devs should look back at GW1 it dost have spectator functions
---
If this works then GW2 (or Windows) is doing a poor job of handling workload assignment for FX CPUs. 
---
Rather than disabling cores you should be able to achieve the same performance increase by assigning *Processor affinity* through *Task Manager* or using something like Process Lasso to automate it.
---
But finishers are dependant on the type of field, unless you and OP are suggesting these traits proc on every single field regardless of what it does. That would be stupid of course so I didn't consider it.

Oh nice, build is similar-ish to what I have (r5 2600, gtx 980). With our GPU's being an overkill for gw2 anyway.
---
Eager to hear more :D got used to meta events being around 45 fps, but what I'm trully interested about is fotm over 100 fps and raids over 60 constant.
---
Cheers for your time. 
---
I have experimented with this since Griffin was released and in my testing there is a maximum height above your starting position, which they talk about in a guild chat. The purpose of this is that you can continuously gain height forever, until you hit map limit and the game starts glitching your characters position.
---
I will verify the original method, you're talking about, when I get a chance. 
---
Taco is just an overlay so yes
---
Maybe they tried to implement that, I do at times feel like the griffon is hitting something up there, but if it exists it is inconsistent and you can definitely go past it.
---
Only 1 version of it. It'd only have to go through Anet again if he tries to add a new *function* to it. Normal updates to keep it running do not go through Anet at all.
---
So Anet checked a very old version of arcdps *after* he removed the stuff Anet banned BDGM for (namely, gear check.) and said it was okay to use now but that is all you get.
---
I'm not saying this to spread distrust, just was making a joke because people talk as if this was the only time we had a closed source thing shared here.
---
That's really not out of the ordinary then. Events and cities tank FPS in general compared to open-world.
---
Nice! Like I said, I'm gonna see what happens with the metas. Currently I'm around 120 FPS in normal open world. Checking in at Divinitys Reach I'm at around 55-75 FPS with all the players around, so pretty good as well.
---
Interesting. I'll experiment with it again. It's possible the gravity gets bugged with Griffin, if you can naturally gain infinite altitude with the core masteries, or maybe something else is going on. 
---
that doesn't mean you cant still use 32bit programmes tho
---
Amazing job. I'm just sad that it falls to a community member to get the dx12 compatability added in to the gmlame rather than Anet.
---
If the minimum frame rate improvement is as good as you claim, you have yourself a willing user
---
just drag both folders over into the same folder as gw2.exe, then if it asks, merge the bin64 files
---
Play the game, not the UI they say.
---
&gt;People are right to be skeptical,

Literally what i said first thing.
---
gonna have to manual download updates for now
---
if you give them lots of cash sure
---
Remember when meme posts actually came with images?
---
Gendarran Farm remembers.
---
In the case of the FX CPUs, it's because when you disable the four extra cores that way the other four cores can use all of the cache for themselves.
---
the best farming overall is thief, specifically daredevil with shortbow, i prefer fire+stamina sigils and lotus training..enable auto-target and spam dodge and 1
---
other good farming builds: flamethrower turret engi, guardian with f1 spam(multiple)varieties exist), greatsword mirage(same method as thief)
---
i strongly suggest you avoid reaper that gets circlejerked around here as the be all end all pve class since it's frankly trash at farming..i mean think about it, what do you tag with? staff? after you used your marks you won't hit anything in time as everything dies in seconds and staff auto is too slow!
---
what other ranged options you have? axe is single target and only 900 range, scepter is condi so you will get 1 single bleed before whatever you attack dies..did i mention trash mobility? 
---
yea you can totally survive stuff but are you gonna need it in a 50 man zerg? or better yet, are you gonna die as thief with stamina sigil spamming dodge all day?
---
this is all for open world..if you wanna farm something like fractals then look into a bursty meta build like DH/weaver
---
personally i hate fractal farming, it's extremely repetitive and frustrating..it feels like my brain turns to mush but hey if you can do it and even have some account augmentations then it's good gold
---
tl;dr thief
---
Awesome made up my mind! Sending you a PM :)

I have 8600k @5ghz and gtx 980 it improved my minimum fps and camera lag is gone
---
The challenge is many of the performance improvements are only available in DX12.
---
See:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9ntaqg/gw2_graphics_engine/
---
- Most of the improvements will come from async compute which is DX12 only.
---
I don't see you climbing higher than airship. Can this be proven or backed up from other pLyerz?
---
Would be pretty epic if you could pose your alts on a stand, and it would copy their pose, armor, and features as a statue you could place at different locations in your HI.   Or even just have your Alts linger around your HI as full characters.
---
I'd be.. sort of ok with just armor stands with selectable armor
---
Hammer was already trash DPS in PvE. Short Bow is better even with 0 condition damage.
---
Running 1 chrono per 10 players is hardly OP.
---
It is (still) possible to continue gaining height despite the changes implemented a while back it doing the same as before: Griffin take off... dive, dive, flap wings once pull up as high as you can go, flap wings up once, repeat
---
I do it all the time as long as you can continue building momentum you can continue gaining height.
---
Not a really good indicator because it could be a large tooth a small creature or a small tooth on a large creature.
---
Is that why the oceans and lakes have no waves?
---
Clearly I don’t understand sarcasm, apologies friend 
---
Can you please redo your test results somewhere else as the test done in Mistlock introduces many factors which can affect FPS, such as the amount of character models in your DX9 image versus the DX12 image. 
---
I did my [test](https://imgur.com/a/Y9ww3PG) at the Queensdale swamp as there's very little people, and resulted in no changes.
---
That's not to say that it had no impact on my FPS, the places where I did experience some FPS gains often have outside factors which can affect the results if I were to do my test. I just started recently again so the Queensdale swamp was the only location I know of where it's pretty isolated.
---
On the contrary. He was far more powerful than when encountered in PoF. If anything he'd increase in size rather. The weakening they talk about is straight up exhaustion and damage from battling. That wouldn't shrink you up. If that were the case then my character should be the size of season 1 Taimi.

I remember taco got a bit of shit storm too at the start, but he's been heavily into the demoscene, so a lot of people knew about him and told the worst naysayers to go pound sand.
---
Yes, but even Dx11 was (still is) a huge step forward than DX9.
---
Damn I forgot that 8 and 7 were already ended as well. Just read the other day that 60% of Steam users are on Windows 10 so there are still a ton of people not upgrading. I still see all the time people complaining about Windows 10 but I upgraded on launch day and really have had no major issues. Now disabling a lot of the tracking stuff was annoying but it didn't take too long.
---
And I could go look it up but when STO ditched DX9 and Windows XP there were hundreds of posts on the official forums and reddit screaming at Cryptic saying how dare you do this. Many people, myself included, tried explaining to these people how terrible it is to still be on XP and so many just said I can't afford a new PC. We even had a thread at one point showing $200-$300 PCs that could run the game on par with their XP machines and they still complained. I understand not everyone has a huge income but if you are using a decade old PC it is freaking time to upgrade people.

In general it seems like the legacy code for GW2 has tons of technical debt, at least partially on account of being inherited from GW1.

---
The OP is still trying to help after all the shits that he got from the previous thread? Damn, If it were me I'd just give a middle finger to this community.

This. It's unfortunate that Anet has literally neglected the very GUILD WARS game mode that makes GUILD WARS 2 different from every basic MMORPG. WvW IS GUILD WARS. Why would I spend thousands of hours to craft Legendary weapons/armour/backpacks so that I can fight PvE??? PvP ignores all of your time and effort, offering generic stats. Meanwhile raids were added so after the fact, and are so niche, that only a small percentage even play them or find them fun. The literal endgame of GUILD WARS was WvW, except Anet forgot that and has chosen to focus on being a generic MMORPG.... which is sad.

What if you could buy npc's for your house that you could put armor on? Gear models? And they don't have to look like your alts but can if you want them to
---
A sneakpeak of my other characters as well :D
---
Whatever "Armor stand" is in your imagination, you have not conveyed it. 
---
You may as well ask "Blespreglers. Yay or nay?"
---
Awesome! That him: Asuaka. Thanks for getting back to me on this. I really am grateful for all the work you guys did, specifically because I’m one of those list-checker people!
---
Healing engi does give boons, there's a core spec trait that makes turrets pulse out a boon like the ranger trait that makes spirits pulse out a boon
---
Go to the Silverwastes, do 5 events and the meta through to the end and you'll get +200 MF. The rest you need to get with boosters and luck. 
---
4 years? You've missed 2 expansions and 3 living world seasons. Depending on when you quit, and assuming you buy everything, that means:
---
#Content
---
* 22 New PvE Zones (2 Season 2, 4 HoT, 6 Season 3, 5 PoF, 5 Season 4)    
---
* The introduction of Raids, and all 6 current raids    
---
* 6 New Fractals (Chaos, Nightmare, Shattered Observatory, Twilight Oasis, Deepstone, Sirens Reef) and most of the only ones have been reworked to reach the new level of quality expected.    
---
* Approximately 45 hours of new story.    
---
* A new WvW map (Though admittedly it's not popular)   
---
* 3 Standard PvP Maps and 3 more Specialty ones.   
---
* A couple dozen earnable in game weapon sets and maybe a dozen full armor sets, with a couple dozen more individual pieces.
---
* A new Heavy Armor class, the Revanant
---
#Systems    
---
* Traits got reworked into Specializations. 
---
* Elite Specializations were added that are basically sub classes. There are 2 per class (E.G. Mesmers can now be Mesmers, Chronomancer, or Mirages)  
---
* Fractals got completely overhauled. There are now 100 scales instead of 50, and you only do one at a time instead of 3. Rewards and progression were added.    
---
* Guilds got Guild Halls, which while slightly underwhelming are still good fun.   
---
* Masteries were introduced, which are basically environmental abilities you spend exp on after 80.    
---
* Heart of Thorns introduced Gliding    
---
* Path of Fire introduced mounts, which are more like vehicles than speed boosts.   
---
* WvW got some reward updates, and allows gliding.   
---
* PvP got ranked seasons.    
---
* PvP got automated Daily and Monthly tournaments     
---
I'm probably missing a bunch. Basically the whole game changed system-wise, and there is easily double the content now.
---
Basically the only thing that hasn't changed is the level cap is still 80 and the best gear stat wise is still Ascended.
---
I literally don't understand what you are asking. Like you want to fill your home instance with empty versions of clothes? Like a living closet? So I could fill every square cubit of my home instance with all the armour I've unlocked, so that the air itself is made of fabric and metal?
---
what the fuck are you talking. dont drink and reddit..
---
Hah! I hardly do any, but I have that one because they weren't account bound at first and my friend collected them all. So I got them from his guild bank and ...er.. achieved. 
---
##Like alacrity
---
ya know, the boon that only 2 classes have neither of which are medium armor. The boon that people want 100% uptime for.
---
Scrapper alacrity is a no-brainer.
---
&gt; First off, the fx line does not have any 8core cpus. They are all up to 4core with matching extra interger compute units.
---
I love when pedantic nerds try to pretend like they are unaware of the controversy and simply 'correct' someone like this, only causing further confusion so that they can think about how smart they are
---
oh wait no I don't love that
---
Honestly taking advantage of the ongoing Lunar New Year stuff. Lucky Envelopes can get you a shit ton of luck to eat and it can help you get a good start towards maxing magic find.
---
Its only the truth. Sorry you dont like it.
---
Not really. The higher polycount a model has the larger the base can get. This is why they never made a Mini Glint in GW1 despite high demand (can be done with GW2 given better tech as we see with the Mini Tequatl), and likely why we won't ever get a Mini Zhaitan. Their polycount is just too high.
---
And there is a quick point where upscaling blurs the texture as textures are raster images. So without a new texture you won't see the a, say, Rock Dog the size of Zhaitan in-game.
---
I would very much like to see the world go into utter chaos for a bit, and we (the commander) run around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to put out fires until we stop and stare and realize everything is on fire, even the water. We got these characters who've died the last 2 chapters killed. We caused Kralk's powering up. We brought all these groups together just to be powerless as they all fall apart or die. Draped over a bar sounds about right, except that I assume our characters are the type to go out in a blaze of glory trying to fix our mistake with one last ditch effort.  
---
THAT is the low point: On the verge of dying again; no friends or magic to save us; the world crumbling into branded ruins around us; everything devolving into small pockets of survivors fighting for survival, scattered across a wasteland, probably desperately trying to escape to Cantha or across the Charr homelands. Before anything else, survival through gritt alone and running with everyone else, trying to escape Kralkatorik. That'd be one way to end up in Cantha for the next expansion lol.  
---
Then, of course, we'd be prompted by friends or by some power in Cantha to pick our selves up and brush off our shoulders, bring the gang back together, rebuild our forces, and go take a big vengeful bite out of Kralk to make him pay for all the loses.   
---
I very much doubt Anet would go as far as I'd like to see it go, though XD
---
The MMORPG website was allowed to play the newest episode before it was released so they could publish an article about it to hype everyone up.
---
In the article they labelled this episode as the "Penultimate" to Living World Season 4, which means there will be one more coming.
---
Griffon collection is a fun and relatively easy collection to accomplish, I think they really nailed it balancing the difficulty/effort required with the reward on that one, and it's such a great mount.
---
I enjoyed PoF as well, although every time they bring up LW1 stuff it makes me sad because I wasn't around to play it, and they basically condemned anyone who isn't an original veteran to never actually have experienced the full story for their game
---
Thx I'll give thief a try 
---
Pop a lvl60 scroll and go get four of them.
---
Thank you soo much for this tool!

Those are my laptop memory ram, graphic card and  processor information.
---
In crowded places, like the meta events on the new living story map, I notice a improve.
---
:)
---
Such a beautiful language~
---
Not too sure about the red cele, its a bit weird, like its been programmed to always be on highest priority meaning it doesnt stack with any skin infusions of anykind. Yea as for snow diamond: thats stacks with WH but not Cele blue. I guess WH is more of a white skin "aura" than a white skin texture.
---
Key runs are a thing you know. Its tedious but possible. Black lion keys are hyper valuable and a lot of pricey items can be found in them.  
---
Id be fine with a drop rate adjustment if for the more expensive items like permabank and stuff rather than black lion keys being more common. We dont need black lion weapons to lower in value even more.  
---
Have Mesmer but went Chrono... Fak
---
What are you talking about you can farm keys all the time. There is one at lvl 10 in personal story that can be done one time every week. Then you have a key at lvl 40 and 60. One in Season 2 and one in HoT story. On top of that you might also get one when completing a map. The latter is a chance but it is not as bad of a chance as you might think. So there already are ways of farming keys. And you can also farm gold, exchange to gems, buy keys. So what else you feel you need?
---
You have much more to learn ;)
---
Thank you for taking your time on explaining this I just dont wanna corrupt any files so im making sure &lt;3
---
Zhaitan is the biggest dragon. Only things in gw2 that are bigger are worms
---
4? Isn't it one at 10, 30, 60?
---
It's not a hard ceiling, but a sort of point of diminishing returns. The higher you go beyond your starting altitude, the less height you gain on subsequent dive/climb rotations. 
---
There are three types of infusion cosmetic effects. Auras, skin textures, and post-processing effexts.
---
Snow Diamond has all three. Celestial blue is just a skin textures and no skin textures stack. Same goes for Ember, Crystal, Toy-Shell, and Celestial red.
---
Snow Diamond would stack eith them but it gives a bluiah hue so for a blue texture like Celestial Blue it'll be very subtle. The winter infusion is an aura And post-processing effect so it stacks perfectly with any skin texture infusion, but any other post-processing infusion effect won't stack.
---
Only one texture and one post processing effect will show over whatever it effects. Only way to get tep post processing infusion effects would be to find one that affects skin or armor only and one that affects both or just the opposite.
---
&gt; dragons we know blew up after their death: vlast
---
&gt; dragons we know didn't blow up after their death: zhaitan, mordremoth, glint
---
I can agree with glint, the rest is wrong on your side. We know Zhaitan blew up / leaked magic even though we didn't see it because other dragons got his powers. And we saw mordremoth blowing up - literally trahearnes head blew up and hit glint's egg with mordy's magic. Vlast also blew up. We didn't see glint blowing up BUT it may be explained easily - she might as well because the place kralkatorrik killed her is giant whole (leading to her lair) wherer she might have indeed blew up. BUT if we agree she didn't, that's possible as well and still doesn't contradict my theory as at that time magic Tyria wasn't destabilized like it is now.
---
5 if you count living world and HoT. 
---
You could have read my post before commenting...
---
He he's not a manifestation of the storm. He becomes the storm much like an Elementalist can become a tornado or whirlpool.
---
This build is from 11 months ago. A lot has changed on power chrono in that time (domi no longer has blurred inscriptions)
---
"If you ignore all the things that contradict my argument, you'll see that I am correct."
---
I don't know if this feature was ever requested, but it's been so long since the launch of HoT that the probabilty of them adding it now is very close to 0.
---
first 
---
&gt; So I find it incredibly weird that all the best skins are behind a paywall considering the game is paid for those with expansions
---
thats subjective.
---
second
---
&gt; So no this isn't a valid anwser. Neither is leveling a level 10 character over and over again )
---
you cant just write off 2 pretty common ways to get easy keys on a regular basis and then say "there is no way to get them weekly"...
---
If you're going to 80, you can also run up through part 11 of HoT's storyline to get an additional key there too.
---
But it's a bit odd to count extra keys from level 80 content when you specifically said level 60.
---
lol dude i don't care the slightest what you accept or not. Get over your self.
---
Buy gems from the gem store if you really want something from the BLCs.
---
Then try to imagine why a 7 year old game still gets regular and quality updates. 
---
I don't think this is an exploit. I just thought it was a cool thing you could do with the new mastery.
---
Alright, I suppose we are ignoring the fact that we literally saw Glints body in the very same release, which clearly did NOT blow up? 
---
And i did. You have story keys, map keys and farming gold for keys. All of them very valid and the story takes 15 min to do so what else do you ask for?
---
I thought Steve was the insanity endlessly chasing people around the Mass King's Labyrinth with a chain sword...
---
  "$15 isn't paying for the game " Yeah it is, it's right there. Also I never said to remove cash shop sales.  When farming gold and farming story might be a way to get them, it's not really you're typical gameplay  hence why it's called FARMING. Many game a free so the sell price isn't relevant here. This was a way to  introduce weekly and that black lion keys would be a great rewards. How many players have u seen quite the second they reach max level? The truth is when u realise most of your possible goals are behind excessive grinding or a paywall, it will make most people quit before even considering spending money, which is the last thing any company should want. ESPECIALLY if they already spent up to 30-60$. 
---
No I'm not. However Glint wasnt flying coctail of magic that Aurene is/was currently. When Glint died magic in Tyria wasn't destabilized as it is now. So that would explain lack of explosion of her body. That, or inconsistent writing.
---
Commenting on this so I can find it once I get home.
---
So... I suppose the player character is still dead and hallucinating everything that happened since PoF then?
---
They already fixed the easier way of performing the reset to a higher ceiling trick, which you could do by just holding the dive button while stationary, which would allow you to gain infinite height and then jump off.
---
Can't speak for Jormag but there isn't a Steve model because STEVE IS THE OCEAN!!!  ;)
---
Same, really sucks in general that some achievements are not obtainable anymore.
---
For some reason I've always imagined Jormag to be the smallest. Bubbles will probably be some eldritch abomination of incomprehensible size.
---
At least 10
---
Most likely PvP gizmos. They are a unique legendary items that can only be acquired by winning monthly Automated Tournaments.
---
Ah. Not specifically a mesmer mask, but a Halloween hood.
---
It still looks fantastic though. 
---
Same here. 
---
You put the lime in the coconut. 
---
Screw the downvoters, I at least am thankful for the addition.
---
Thanks, I’m really new to guild wars and wanted to try WvW since it looks fun but I have no idea about what’s meta etc
---
I would preffer engi (holo). good damage, nice aoe and cc with also options to support depending on the kits you're using.
---
I'll have guardian as my number 2.
---
The game runs realy great as long as you dont have to load many models, thats why he compares in crowded places, ofc in places where there's 0 models it wont have any change 
---
it's the TEST outfit. only 2400 gems
---
Fuck. Now I want windows 10. But so many of the other games that I play don't get along with windows 10.
---
Why the hell is it that so many MMO's feel so poorly optimized compared to most other games? And why are they all so CPU bound? Urrrrrrgh. My years old rig is creaking and I need to update it. I got a 1080ti recently and too many games still run like molasses.
---
Mordremoth has always shown a bit of Zhaitan's magic. Why else would mordrem wolves be made from actual wolf corpses, instead of being made entirely of plants like sylvan hounds?
---
That'd explain why Zhaitan was so small since iirc he hadn't started consuming the leylines.
---
That's  still not an exploit
---
Which one are you missing?
---
Fractal bosses are still frequently invisible 
---
"Uhh Zojja, I don't think your new cloaking tech is working properly..."
---
Im more familiar with vulkan than DX12. But it looks like you are reverse engineering HLSL in the pipeline and reconstructing them. This isn't performance critical as its likely happening on boot. But isn't dx9 hlsl compatible with higher versions? Or does 12 expect to have opcodes only for 12?
---
I generally use a more standard 1h sword build with a greatsword for range and tagging, but for a focused greatsword build i've had alot of fun with the following;
---
domination: 2 2 1 / middle middle top, mainly for imagined burden; bonuses to greatsword and GS 4 generates two phantasms
---
illusions 2 2 1, phantasms spawn with quickness, you gain a phantasm's boons and might when they become clones
---
chrono 2 3 3 mainly for chronophantasma, phantasms are resummoned after attacking
---
greatsword 4 now summons a total of four phantasms. after they attack they give you their quickness and might. if you use it off cooldown you can maintain 15+ stacks of might (more if you let GS 2 bounce off the phantasms and transfer that might to you) and almost permanent quickness just from the one skill. it's alot of fun and you can do whatever you want with your utility slots
---
definitely nowhere near optimal but I'm a sucker for goofy trait combinations like this
---
Can fast forward edit it after.
---
Do you do video song requests?
