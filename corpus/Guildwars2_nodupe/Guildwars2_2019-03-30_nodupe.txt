Depending on a guilds capture anthem you might hear the theme when a guild claims. Most likely this is what you are hearing.
---
What backpiece is that on the light one? I saw it on someone in-game earlier and it looked ace!
---
I just want a Permanent Hair contract but don't want to spend all that gold on it. 
---
Only time it would be worth it is with 100% off

I got these last weekend from the zone mapping reward from not the latest living world update but the one before that (the one with the big cubic Inquest base, where you meet the Ohmalkan (sp?).  I didn't think it was that awesome and had no idea it was special until reading this thread.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF8PdZrJqGg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF8PdZrJqGg)   
---
Yes, it was an anthem after all. Well that is disappointing but I am of sound mind now at least. Thanks!
---
Same thing happens with the Wide Rim Glasses on several Sylvari faces, female and male. :( 
---
No need to max it out, it's the first step.
---
You could also very easily swap those and it still makes complete sense
---
Im in the process of doing this now. Its taking some time, but ill get there! Gratz man
---
Its GW2
---
You can literally afk your way to end game
---
Wait, you can colour these radiant pieces? I never used them because i thought it's only white and without permafrost dye it won't fit anything. 
---
43.474 deaths here xD
---
How do I do that?
---
Haha
---
Now that everything is done..... what now?
---
WEll I find the leveling extremely boring for first and end game what should I do first i love pvp and pve
---
Press H, go to traits tab.
---
I tap that one on the right a few times.
---
that one achievement in head of the snake to defend the ship from white mantle raiders is the *only* thing from LS3 I haven't gotten. That one was damn near impossible when it came out, and now there aren't enough people to try.
---
When I played I never could control Petey.
---
Hopefully we'll avenge Blish :((
---
Oh well if my infusions sell till tomorrow i may grab a few keys, have only 480 gold at the moment and i'm saving it for Storage Expander hehe.
---
&gt;(which are uglier than the vanilla ones anyway)
---
This seems to be the rule.
---
Even the folks who make the NPC's know it. I think I've only ever seen one NPC that uses one of those sylvari faces that lack a nose.
---
and while leveling should I complete maps or I should do dungeon?
---
Happy cake day op
---
My sylvari's eyes are lower than the other sylvari faces' eyes which makes her look cuter, but none of the glasses/masks got the memo of where my eyes moved. :(
---
I will be 80 soon to lvl up I found dungeons the quickest. Just run em over and over with groups because you need the currency they give to buy the exotics
---
* Like wasting your gems
---
Better than the Halloween quaggan that's pretending to be a ghost by wearing a bedsheet
---
Ok, cool. Thanks! 
---
I see. Thanks! 
---
Sweet, might be worth getting then. Thanks! 
---
What is this? Is this GW2? wtf? It's only been like 5 days since I last played
---
yea but the map is giant and will always be there, I just wanna get to the lvl 80 stuff(mount). Plus there's usually time in between dungeons, they aren't as popular as I would like.
---
It's a minigame called Super Adventure Box thats available every April.
---
That's so beautiful! I love the colors.
---
I really like the colors in this.
---
Uhm? Im a bs main in raids and the class shits out dps like its nothing. Always at least top 3 dps on core (does fairly low damage but players are bad most of the time) and top dps on berserker if boons are decent. Berserker does a fuck ton off damage. Just look up a rotation and learn it instead of complaining
---
The meme's.
---
every single time, best video advertising they made :P
---
My main is a human male and i've tried that, it doesn't work with **any** of the human faces available.
---
Congrats, i still need a couple of those, takes forever
---
I come and go, but mainly just run dungeons a couple times a year.
---
I can feel and hear your pain, Let me end your suffering...
---
Learn to play a different class and you'll get better at ranger
---
You buy it from a Skritt vendor in Brisban, the wiki article I linked has the name and everything. And it basically applies random conditions to enemies, its just a thrown item. If you throw them fast enough, you'll just keep refreshing the blind condition on them so they won't be able to hit you.
---
nope, maybe my Account is bugged
---
I mean, that's entirely up to you, but I think you'd have a more interesting time doing dungeons
---
I wanna see in game!!
---
Absolutely 0 problems with dodge-jumps, I don't use macros tho.
---
The only think that gives me some trouble and I feel "different" this year are the starting bouncing mushrooms on W1Z2, my char just don't bounce sometimes randomly.
---
Folks can say it’s a scam, but it’s not a bad way to support Anet. I get 50% off 25 keys, they get $20. 
---
I get so much enjoyment out of their content that they provide for free after the initial (and not steep) investment. They earn the $100 they get from me per year on gems. 
---
Plus, I have received reasonably good drops off the keys. Still no elusive permanent contracts, but I own those anyways, so they’d just be a cool drop worth good gold. 
---
The answer is key farm. Or VPN. Those are your choices mate. 
---
They didn't need em because their eyebrows blocked out the sun
---
Who's more advanced now 
---
Alas weebs are partially responsible for the ongoing downfall of civilization... how easily they crept into our lives how easily shows like Pokémon, dragon ball, and drew us into much worse shows that rot the brain, distort image, dessimenates horrible views, and reinforce the already impulsive short term attention span that we get due to smart phones, and the web. 
---
Yeah that's been a big issue for me too. That area never seems to work.
---
Maybe it's on my end, then? Could be a connection issue. It's so bizarre, it just randomly stops registering the action.
---
To me what I like about this game isn't one single features, but the combination of features that make this game unique, particularly in the open world.
---
No kill stealing, no node stealing, everyone can rez everyone without taking a special skill, everyone can buff people even if they're not in the party, you can combo with other people, even if you're not partied.
---
I never go into a dungeon in this game and have a fight over loot dropped, like in some other games.
---
I don't know if you have the expansions or not, so it's hard to recommend specific content, but just the way the game is designed, from combat, to graphics, to the cooperative nature of PvE makes me happy.
---
Of course, now I'm just happy SAB is here. lol 
---
Guild wars is not a smash buttons mmo, you have to understand what yours skills do and what your enemy is doing then play the correct skills at the time. 
---
Do you take 70 day to be top player in others mmo? Just because there are no gear progression it doesn't mean you can't improve. 
---
Lines are quite nice though theres not much things going on. Using these brushes would go a long way  [https://qbrushes.net/guild-wars-2-brushes/](https://qbrushes.net/guild-wars-2-brushes/)  as well as maybe taking inspiration from the asset kit   [https://www.guildwars2.com/en/media/asset-kit/](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/media/asset-kit/)

QAQ thank you!
---
Wait you did, "I'm rich you know"?
---
Why does the Daredevil runes focus on condi damage? I thought the Daredevil build focus on critical change and damage. Has i been playing it wrong?

Are you trying to be Geralt with the Professor's glasses?
---
I really enjoyed the random NPC interactions with each other. Not only are they're with voices (huge plus for me), there's also a tons of them. Love just wondering around and seeing / hearing what the NPCs has to offer.  
---
And of course, the  true end game itself. Fashion Wars. I find it enjoyable testing things out for my characters, and watching other player's beautiful character. I PM them to ask about what equipment / dyes they are using so i can use them too.
---
Just did that one a week ago with a couple of guildies using summons:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Consumable
---
Use the fire elemental powder and ogre pet whistle. We also used kourna's cannon in a box although it's more expensive currencywise. Was probably overkill. Sneak over to the boss and unload your summons.
---
 yikes
---
Just switch to another class. Ranger has nothing to offer in huge scale fights. If you are into high damage then you can either create a scourge or a weaver.
---
You get 20 fragments per dungeon path
---
[Fashionnnnnn](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/92dz67/dont_know_how_to_photoshop_but_id_like_to_show/)
---
What's good about weavers are they don't need the protection of the squad and can release devastating damage if left unchecked. I think OP wants a similar playstyle and has much more contribution.
---
Brace yourselves - I think it's going to explode!
---
For dual-wielded legendaries like Incinerator, do you need two, or can you use one (mainhand) and skin another piece of gear (offhand) with the legendary skin?
---
That's an old issue, same with the trampolines in W2Z2. One you can also abuse in some parts like W1Z3 with dodge jumping to go higher and skip huge sections.
---
I've been having some issues with dodge jumping in general when I'm on a bad connection (mostly where I land looking safe but getting me dead) but I've mostly written that off as PEBKAC from the rust of not playing SAB for a year.
---
Looks like Michal Mcdonald:D
---
What.. what is this?
---
I haven’t played much, and it’s been a while since.. but.. what the hell? 
---
Minecraft, ninja fighting, raft ride?
---
Norns and Guardians
---
There's a build for condi Daredevil which uses a D/D set up with a super easy rotation. It's just not utilized very much
---
They give you some tools to set up a Condi build, specifically impaling lotus (condi on dodge), but again, not a very often used build
---

Once you've cleared everything up to the last checkpoint seen in the video, you can use that checkpoint to cheese things a bit: after the ice ramp and coin #6, intentionally jump off the mountain at the ice bridges. As long as you have more than one heart left, you'll be warped up to the checkpoint right on top of the 7th coin without interrupting the adventure.
---
Doing that easily saves 45+ seconds on the run.
---
Super adventure box. Supposed to be a training simulator for young Asura that we’re testing. Reminiscent of early 3D rpgs
---
The one thing I wish they would do for dungeons at this point is to make every one like the Arah story dungeon, where you can do it by yourself. Yes, it’s less fun that way, but then at least new players can experience the story without having to wait for people in LFG then get ditched because they can’t keep up or they’re a low level.
---
Absence makes the heart grow fonder. It fills a festival gap and doesn't have enough content to be year round while maintaining a good amount of interest /players. It lasts several weeks though, so tons of time to play. 
---
What a fetish lol
---
Awww man... But there is no end game in GW2. Everyone says so. :-D lol.
---
Since he did the Tarir meta more then 100 times I'm not surprised. 
---
Who's "we?"
---
&gt; I die on a consistent basis to thieves who blink all over, or a firebrand who damn near takes my head off; even other soulbeasts.
---
Well yes, properly built rangers/soulbeasts are a PITA to fight as any class. You should not be auto-losing to anything except maybe condition mirages.   
---
Keep in mind though that many people you will encounter in WvW have spent thousands of hours doing exactly that: becoming better at that game mode and the class(es) they play.   
---
&gt; I use my mouse to move the camera, to target, and because it's an mmo mouse, all the skills, even F skils. Only thing it doesn't handle is movement and dodge.
---
You can be successful with whatever control scheme as long as it fits you. I'd guess the vast majority of people you encounter do not use an MMO mouse despite what the vocal minority on forums will say.   
---
&gt; But still, you'd think after 90 days of being a mesmer and 70 days of ranger I'd be able to play them both to some degree of success. Nope. I degenerate to looking at timeouts and mashing anything that isn't on cooldown.
---
Time spent on non-competitive activities is irrelevant. Worse, it will actively hinder your play skill. Go duel other people 5000 times, with video capture. Analyze every single fight and learn from your mistakes. Make improving at the types of PVP combat that you are finding no success at your priority.   
---
&gt; Most likely though? I'm a bad player.
---
Nobody was born a good player. Put effort into becoming better and you will be. 
---
Yes kind of. So essentially there are multiple strongholds that are captured by the three factions. In between capturing them, there are supply escort events and the like. Many things can be done solo or in a small group but usually your server will have organized effort (often led by a few major WvW guilds) to capture some difficult fortresses. You can hop in and out seemlessly but of course you might want to be there for when the big stuff happens. I'm not the best person to ask about WvW but I'm sure there are many youtube videos to help you around :)
---
SC website recommends right now full berserker, force+impact sigils and rune of THIEF
---
Mirage memser for all those jaunty dodges and also another person to make the long journey much more fun.
---
There is a preview option before buying... so you could have checked and avoided this lol 
---
Mirage mesmer for all those jaunty dodges and also a partner to play with to make the journey much more fun.
---
You will drop your key though.
---
Are Macros allowed in GWw? I sincerely hope not
---
Discretize could be taking the fractal options into account, which give you precision among other things depending on your agony resistance.
---
So the question is, are you trying to reach 100% in open world, a fractal or 10-man raid, I.e. do you have Spotter, banners, a healer for scholar uptime?
---
Keep in mind that ferocity scales off power, so sacrificing that for precision can actually hurt your damage. 
---
That being said I think your best bets are, in that order: precision food, accuracy sigil, something like Eagle runes, and then Assassin gear.
---
I thought Augus trained young Asura?
---
Yes and no, it depends https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b6bf2k/first_time_for_the_sab_festivities_what_should_i/ejjcs30/
---
Anyway, jump+dodge macro is allowed
---
some macros are allowed

---
If you look at Rune of the Thief it is clear that the original idea of the thief was to stack precision and conditions. I like the idea of having poisons and bleeds that tick away while we focus on critical hits. It just didn’t turn out that way. 
---
[Dr. Eggman](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/uncyclopedia/images/3/36/DrEggman.png/revision/latest?cb=20150910001630)
---
So having a full set of radiant turns it yellow instead of white?
---
Mesmer, maybe Thief. But Mesmer has acces to stealth, can teleport, has invulnerability, etc.
---
I a thief can do the same, but has the problems of staying alive. Nothing you can't compensate with skill. On the other hand every other profession can do these achievments aswell, but they almost always require a completely unique build or really good patience. 
---
I did the Trap achievment in Joko's temple yesterday. Let me tell you, that evading every trap as a guardian, with no use of teleport and only one not even close to good mobility skill (Leap of Faith/ GS) is really frustrating.
---
You are so funny
---
Your thread has been removed because you are in violation of the 80/20 rule for contributors.
---
Are engi elixirs affected by runes that boost boon duration?
---
with the (raid)build from snowcrows with the rune of thief you will sit at 65% critchance and 72,19% when merged.  
---
since this build expects spotter and banner of discipline, you will be at 100% with fury (20%), banner and spotter (4,76% each)....overcapping by just a tiny 1,41%.  
---
generally if you can't expect those buffs lets say because you are a openworld player, you have different options. the easiest one would be to slap a sigil of accuracy on instead of impact which gives you 7% and you would sit at 99% critchance.  
---
Fashion wars. Decent combat system
---
Rifle is higher in total possible damage output but it has a huge number of limitations that mean it isn't used often.

Guild missions for accessories and laurels for amulets assuming you only need core stats (berserkers) and you don't have season 3 (or even 4) as options.
---
I want to see you using Moa at the Start of a Raid fight and then not getting flamed for CC being bad :3
---
It's impossible to be a good 1v1 player if you don't know what your and opposing class' abilities do. I'd recommend you to just start reading what your abilities do and getting familliar with metabattle guides/builds.
---
I don’t do WvW that often but I do play spvp and Ranger is my main.
---
 When I play WvW I do not lose many 1v (regardless of class)... Its true bunkers will give you some trouble and if they have help or a +1 you need to to disengage... but honestly nearly any player can be picked off the tail of a Zerg and insta melted down by a ranger.
---
Picking off tails of Zerg OR helping with what’s called “pincher” moves is the “Havoc” squad job so there is a place for Ranger, thief, and others in the world of wvw... often less experience comms will want to restrict classes instead of organizing squads by class (you’ll see top commanders always do 2 sub groups and the 2nd team is the Havoc team)
---
Also... “git good” really means to use/abuse a cheesy meta build so try some commonly used builds with proven kill records. (Can’t beat a em join em)
---
(For ranger) Play “sic em sniper” or play something more “boonbeast” and tanky and you will be fine as a roamed or Havoc player.
---
After all that if you still always lose at 1v just go play the PvP until you don’t. (As a few others have pointed out a large part of being “good” at PvP is choosing the right battles to take and avoiding direct counter classes.... same way with PvP) Learning to pick your battles wisely will improve win rate/ratio faster then any amount of button training (pick easy wins avoid reflects/bunker classes)
---
Also although core Ranger is still strong in PvP 1v the ranger class at its nature is a +1 class (not truly a direct combat warrior type class)... so the most effective way you can play is to spread buffs/boons while tab targeting to help others get kills by picking off low/dying targets)
---
Good luck with all you do and just don’t give up on the game mode. PvP and WvW are long game mode, not the short. (Wvw ranks go up to like 6,999 so far and PvP ranks are limitless) so you have to think.. “long game” over short gain type game play. 
---
Hold up. Is that Vax's Raven Queen armor?!

Aaaaahhhh satisfying *drools*

OP also likes to mash random buttons which doesn't really work with weaver, but is actually advised on scourge since a lot of players are just tagging enemies with staff.

Do your daily runs; that's 14 baubles a day at least. Don't want to wait for 2 or 3 days, learn zone 1 trib down to a science and that's an easy bauble every 10-20 minutes.
---
You can stat swap ascended weapons in the mystic forge cheaply 
---
Don't think so, personally. Since skins rotate now more often in BLCs, they don't rise in value as fast anymore, since many people just expect them to be re-released in a BLC in a year or so. The only skins that seemed quite worth was the ultra edgy garbage that a lot of players liked. The Defiant ones don't seem too desirable for most people and I barely see them. I'd guess they'd be stuck forever on the TP, and the price sloooowly rises to a meager 70-90g before they get re-released in a chest and drop to 20-30 or 40-60g depending on rarity. 
---
Then why didn't you know If I was a real player or not?
---
That's the new way Anet notifies you when you are temporary banned .

We just had a huge graphical downgrade after they fired a lot of employees, so anet could somehow survive the harsh times.

Indeed you have to wait until the credits and end music are over, which few people do (especially now that the story continues afterward).

It was a well-known easter egg once but its knowledge was dimmed along with the relevance of Personal Story.

If they actually removed the rolling credits it may explain why it is easier to find out about that part without quitting the instance first.

* try to get to know the Fractals, then you'll love it even more
---
* is currently taking place the Super Adventure Box (SAB) event, search on YouTube how to get there, it's worth the experience, it only happens once a year, it's a special map and a lot of fun
---
* in my opinion the best is Structured PvP (SPvP) and WvW (PvP), the battles are frantic and exciting, the building is also very interesting, so when you feel comfortable with your character, try playing some games
---
* the Dungeons scattered throughout Tyria are a lot of fun as well as the Jumping Puzzles
---
Literally all of these are personal choice because staying alive matters more than doing more damage (until you learn how to do both) and difference between all those isnt very big until you learn how to use the class effectively.
---
Start with full marauder+acrobatics+evade utility until you get comfortable with the class/commander/zerging playstyle. Eventually you want to swap acrobatics for crit strikes and some marauder gear for berserker, but let that be more of an instinct than a goal. 
---
You'll get the feeling of when it's necessary to swap out when you're experienced enough. Besides, sometimes you face weaker, sometimes stronger enemies so it's not wrong to adapt your build to that as well. Just remember one thing - zergs have supports/healers for a reason, if you're positioned properly then it's their fault for not healing/cleansing you on time so focus on positioning and you can easily go glass cannon.
---
Waypoint...
---
This Sceptre Guardian looks way more epic than it's supposed to be.
---
The in-game animation for Sceptre swinging is hilarious. 
---
Up to you. They will rise a bit in value, but personally I would hold onto your tickets because you never know when they are going to release a set you absolutely love. 
---
Gold is easy enough to obtain in loads of other ways, but tickets are a bitch. 
---
However, if you're sitting on like 30 claim tickets, may as well grab a couple to sell at a markup lol
---
for button mashing: take it as slow as you need to and try to think before you press stuff; maybe divide your abilities into burst dps, filler dps and defensive stuff such as stunbreaks/evades/blocks
---
have some sort of plan for defending yourself: are you gonna get bursted in the next few seconds or are you just getting poked? this way you can gauge whether to burn an important cooldown or not
---
don't take wvw 1v1s seriously, the game is not balanced at all around such scenarios..otherwise 1shot from stealth or immortal bruiser builds wouldn't exist
---
positioning is important..you could run tankier gear and play some frontline build but honestly just stay far away and pewpew with bow
---
you might be indeed bad but mostly likely it's an attitude problem..you don't seem to think stuff through or try to improve just kinda "do random stuff and hope for the best"
---
plan B: reroll to scourge, this way you can actually mash everything and perform at an acceptable level(compared to mashing on slb at least)
---
Wtf? No? Daredevil have higher cleave and overall dmg as DE projectiles will just be  destroyed, as a DD you can blink in and spam vault doing arround 10k dmg each till your defensive traits proc then you can safely blink out. But thief is still not the META people want, but DD is by far better than DE in zerg.

Oh god, don't remind me of that too.

Ah yeah, I forgot that only English speakers play this game. How could people even dare to play with others if they aren't perfect English speakers.
---
God forbid if they learned something new, right? If you correct someone you are bad and evil grammar nazi and we can't have that level of unfriendliness in our progressive community.
---
No, my honest mistake. I only knew the price of Identity Repair Kit. 350 isn't that bad but I still feel bamboozled.
---
Wow that's beast!.
---
Zap from random leftover mystic forging probably :D
---
Changed their LFGs - hard to do that with just whispering 
---
I think the personal story was great until the racial stories ended and it all got merged into the orders storyline. The stories being unique to  each race and the choices during character creation was one of the strongest points and they just abandoned that because it's easier to make one boring story that is even less fun to replay.
---
Oooh, that's what you were doing. 
---
I would just recommend to play a Power Scourge, if you want to deal real AoE damage for a squad.
---
You can optimize your gear via gw2skills.net yourself. You should obv. aim for having 100% crit chance with Fury and Food. Critical Strikes is usually not too good for PvP and WvW since you just gain some minor damage overall while dropping huge chunks of your surviveability; you can bet on "Invigorating Precision" if you want to, but you will die soon after you ran out of dodges and initiative anyway... As Staff Stomper I would use "Channeled Vigor" as heal. Your utilities should be mostly "Signet of Agility", "Shadowstep" and "Roll for Initiative".
---
Awesome art dude! Charr is the best race!
---
My fps in WvW zerg.
---
Would you mind posting how much you paid for this? Or PMing it to me? This is awesome :D
---
Wish my charr looked more murdery and less fluffy, kinda goes for every charr in the game
---
Wish I could buy more...
---
I'm pretty sure their point is that you can do...fractals period, with a 'five people and kill shit' comp. Not ALL fractals, clearly, T4s take more work than that. But I can get fractal loot in general by grabbing four random friends and rollin in without any issue. Same with dungeons. Raids, though, have no equivalent. 
---
And if that's not the point they were making, then it's the point I'M making. The Wintersday 'raid' is proof that a FFXIV-style 'story mode raid' is entirely possible. Could do that with heavily nerfed loot and probably relieve a lot of dungeon fans' complaints if I had to guess.
---
Sometimes I remember that ONE stack is actually all I should be able to have in storage and then wonder how I was able to live like that.
---
One of the most underrated QoL items.
---
They're not wrong.
---
Rules for this dont always work like that.  If for whatever reason an acronym ends in lowercase.  Its common to use 's or s' despite not being possessive.  Similar to those that end is a capital S. Ss doesnt look as nice as S's.  English doesnt really work like Latin languages in the sense that our grammar rules are more guidelines than anything.
---
Usually not the biggest fan of charr.. but this? This is awesome.
---
Absolutely agree. That first one you buy is the biggest upgrade - literally doubling your storage capacity from 250 to 500 is huge. I recommend it to everyone.
---
I currently have size 1000 and i want to buy another one of these but my gf is telling me I dont need it so i shouldnt waste my gems. Can someone make a really convincing argumebt in favour of buying this?
---
Or a furry

Does the unstable monster give a mystic coin?
---
Monster has his own event and he spawns randomly at a set time, he even has a spot in the wiki in the events page
---
righ't
---
It wouldn't take too long to grind out all the rewards, and their value would drop. Then people would rarely play the mode anymore.
---
No I meant the art style isn't intended for the furry crowd which is refreshing.
---
Don't take my word for it but the forum post doesn't seem to prohibit that (it's not SAB related post anyway).
---
Only in the bank's mat tab.
---
Quality bait. Got me with:
---
&gt;undesirable toxic behavior in group content.
---
Solo, 'cause waiting for other people to catch up slows it down, as does waiting for traps to reset after other people triggering them if they're ahead of you (mostly the jumping rocks.)  
---
Full run of regular + trib mode (1-1 through 2-3) takes just under 2 hours, but I've had a decent amount of practice, and know the routes really well.
---
Definitely - it's slightly less broadly applicable than daredevil but it's roughly as good.
---
Combat. As a WoW player I used to bemoan that GW2 only had 3 skills which didn't matter and therefore there was no buildcrafting and little gameplay. Turns out that's just thieves and far, far from the truth. Going into a fight I have to be aware of so many things, condis, breakbars, stunbreaks, positioning, and that's not even PvP. It manages to reward the perfect balance of aggressive and reactive play. The story is okay (better in recent episodes), and the mounts are good, and quests are cooperative, but what I'm really digging the most right now is the smooth, complex combat. For those interested, mostly playing Mirage, Chrono, and Weaver.
---
doubt i fall into the "average" category, but out of curiosity i just counted: turns out i have 89 materials that exceed 1000.
---
Let me get my salt ready.
---
Same here have 1000 but I'm buying 4 more today. My reasoning is legendary crafting from wvw. I wanna craft a full set at once but I need 1500 of every T5 mat...
---
If you generally craft a lot and hoard materials for future use then why not.
---
Might as well max out the storage while it is on sale anyway. 
---
But the fact that we have so many exceptions is *exactly* why it's important that we inform people about them, because it's something that's harder to learn and therefore requires a little more instruction and care in order to remember. And who gets to determine what is considered "nitpicky"? We can't expect people to know something that they've never been told, after all, so why is it considered so awful to tell them (so long as you're nice about it)?  
---
The punctuation may not matter as much in this particular situation, but there are certainly situations where using the wrong punctuation can actually change the entire meaning of what you're trying to say. So helping someone learn the rules (and the exceptions to the rules) ultimately helps facilitate clear communication in the future, which is a positive for *everyone*.
---
Must be an NA post. Never seen CM's in eu
---
Nah man, the checkpoint launch. Works maybe 20% of the time for me.
---
Is SAB worth investing time in as a new player ? I've heard about the event but don't know if there is good things I can get from it
---
Anyone knows of a way to create macros like this on MacOS by any chance?
---
Yeah? The "warclaw bug", as you put it, has happened since they were released on every mount. It's not like it started with the Warclaw.
---
I agree with your sentiment and 100% support gently correcting grammar and punctuation, but there is something absolutely hilarious about the hypocrisy of getting so upset about downvotes (which are normal and expected and happen to even the best posts) that you feel the need to edit and call *other* people snowflakes.
---
I wish we could scrub the entire "sensitive" meaning of "snowflake" out of our collective lexicon. It's just another loaded word that wannabe tough-guys (who are often, themselves, very upset about something in the first place) use to imply that anyone who disagrees with them is too sensitive to handle their badass truth-bringing.
---
No... sometimes people just disagree. If you have to resort to name-calling and attacking the character of those who disagree with you instead of addressing their argument, then you usually have a pretty weak argument, indeed.
---
&gt;Unless you play mesmer, any meta
---
that is not how it works
---
Thats some quality cosplay!
---
Joke...
---
As you said with the ascended mats, I found that made the biggest difference. But also I've found it convenient with the other basic mats, like silk, mithril, and leather.
---

---
The flat road thinks the beetle is a huge jump?
---
But what about T4's loot?  What about the CM's challenge level?
---
If you're ever going to go for a legendary, you 100% need more storage of some kind, but that could be storage expander, bank tabs, or alts to hold materials or you're going to drive yourself crazy playing Inventory Wars.
---
Mats really pile up quickly during normal farming if you don't stay on top of selling mats and crafting. I prefer to let things build up a little and then craft more all at once instead of having to stop and deal with it more often. As I said, I recommend every player get the first upgrade for the Storage Expander. It really does make a huge difference IMO. Whether you go beyond 1 expander, however, is up to you.

Because 2018 was just *so* long ago, right?

It's almost like these things actually still exist even when their popular period is over...

Im pretty sure furries would love this anyways

its not worth it, for the few materials that pile up you better get a character mule
---
Now I need a cute charr to comm &gt;:c
---
You probably don't look at furry art then :o
---
Thank you! Kept seeing all this crazy speed in the YouTube vids and didn't know how that was happening.
---
Really helpfull comment thanks a lot! Which expansion should I buy first and in PoF do you get the mounts at level 1? :)
---
There's nothing of great value to a new player relatively to other things that you can do at the moment. However, there will come a point when the currency you gained from SAB "matters" and since it's a limited-time event, I would encourage you to do it now.
---
Here's a way to save some time:
---
1. Download and install Taco with tekkit guide
---
2. Use it to finish world 1 and world 2 normal mode.
---
3. Then do 3 SAB dailies task whenever you play.
---
Of course you can do more but this will give you a bunch of reward and not taking too long. At the end of the day though, playing is about fun. Try it and if you like it, play away. If you don't even if the reward is valuable you don't have to play. GW2 has many things for you to do
---
Gives a mystic coin once a day. Usually there are organized runs for killing it
---
Ye's, your write ab'out tha't.
---
Thank you.
---
Actually...it'd be meta for human and norn females.
---
If you like the event, do it. If you want to gamble for that random ascended chest at a succesdul run then do it. Also gives 2 gold daily and achievements, if you dont have them already. If you want to do it for purely the farming potential then I guess it isnt that good.
---
that's the way I see it too: if it's something I know I will need to keep and use later (like for crafting legendaries) I just keep as much as I need then sell the extra. There are only a handful of depositables I would want more than 250 of at a given time as I stockpile to make legendaries and whatnot.
---
the only common convenience I see out of this is being able to deposit &gt;250 of ore/scraps from mass salvaging before you get a chance to craft them into more condensed forms.
---
I can only imagine how hot they'd sound with a severe lisp
---
Can confirm--I love it, especially that it's faithful to the source material. Most artists don't pay attention to charr anatomy and this one nails it.
---
for equality reasons everyone gets clipping issues now
---
They can finally play the game.
---
I got 2 ascended tequatl drops in a week and then haven't gotten one since. Those were definitely awesome, but the best drop is probably either Deathwish (staff that looks like a skull and spine) or Coldsnap (pretty blue scepter) just because they're both skins I love that I'd never have heard of had they not dropped for me randomly. 
---
Probably the two dusks I got like 3 months from each other. One was from a TA speed run bag and the other was from the champ abomination just before the eye of Zhaitan world boss. Then I was messing around with the mystic forge one day and accidentally a dawn. But that was like 4 years ago now. Haven't seen a precursor since, but I still count myself pretty lucky.
---
You can do that with nearly every class in the game. The only exceptions being warrior and thief but even those two can be built for support just not to the same degree as the rest and probably not as easy to use.
---
Also generally everyone stay in the thick of things. Partly because of mechanics and partly because of enemy behavior. Many mechanics are centered around the caster so if you stay behind it halves your coverage. There are mobs that will activate skills based on range or select their target based on range. If you stay too far back that can make them run around more than necessary. Being further away also makes it harder for you to ress/be ressed. Some of that also depends the specifics of build as well. I use a healing tempest when doing a bounty train partly because I can ress people from 1400 range. On the other hand damage mitigation is a bit lacking but that is fine since it tends to be too chaotic to try to do that anyway. 
---
In terms of flat out best "heals per second" I am not sure who is best but guardian(firebrand) is a nice option if you also want other support elements like blocking hits. The other advantage of guardian and elementalist is that you can do this from the start. Meanwhile druid(ranger) and scourge(necromancer) requires lv80. Mesmer and revenant could start partway through leveling.
---
Imagine unironically calling people plebs
---
Apparently people missed that it was a joke. Oh well. /shrug
---
They need to increase the maximum :(
---
yes if you open the floaty chests while inside the level, it adds to the 250/500/750 bauble cap that you have depending on the size bag you unlocked. Playing any further than after you cap baubles and you just won't get any more, so just exchange them into bubbles asap.
---
I would donate 200 fucking dollars just to have 2 in game and never be able to upgrade them and have them be text only switch able from the console /load build2 DKFJDKSLF:JSDFJKDSFJK
---
 but /gg is useful before/in the middle of some fights ...
---
Critical Strikes vs Acrobatics is less about the damage difference and more about how your sustain works.  Unless you're running in a tight guild group where you have a lot of active sustain being thrown onto you, you'd want Invigorating Precision over No Quarter.  That means you'd only be getting extra damage from Practiced Tolerance (\~6%), the wrong side of weighted DPS from Ferocious Strikes, and a bit of inconsistent crit.  It's not a big difference.
---
The bigger difference is Invigorating Precision (and some modest damage) vs the defensive options in Acrobatics.  Invigorating Precision tends to work better in smaller, tighter fights, where there's less stray harass and tighter pushes and bombs.  It gives powerful sustain during those and really lets you go hard and maximize a push.  Acrobatics is better in more prolonged and chaotic fights.  It gives you better long term sustain, especially initiative and endurance regen that help you recover between pushes or pick at stragglers.  It also has good emergency passives in Instant Reflexes and Hard to Catch that are most helpful when the fights are more chaotic (and you're more likely to be caught off guard).
---
On the whole it is less about an offensive / defensive trade-off (especially since initiative and endurance turn into damage) and more about the kinds of fights you're having.  If you are running with a guild group with good coordination, you can maximize that coordination with Critical Strikes and Invigorating Precision.  If it's full map zerg fights or open pins you're going to be better off with Acrobatics.  It's easy to switch accordingly.
---
Full Marauder is about as glassy as you would want to be.  You get very poor returns on swapping out some Marauder gear for Berserker.  For instance, dropping the lowest value Marauder pieces for Berserker (shoulder/glove/boots + rings and accessories) gets you close to a 50/50 mix, and that buys you less than 5% additional damage at a cost of nearly 3000 health.  Not saying you can't do it, but the returns are going to be very marginal.
---
If you're running an Accuracy sigil your target for Precision is 2428; 2323 if you want to maximize Keen Observer when using Critical Strikes above 90% health.  Full Marauder will poke just above 2323 at 2352; swap a couple minor armor pieces if that bothers you.  Otherwise you're not going to hit the crit cap with Mara / Scholar.
---
Where the crit cap does come into play is if you want to swap from Scholar to Eagle, since that moves a chunk of Power into Precision.  If it weren't for the crit cap that's a largely lateral move on the raw stats, and that offers a 10% to foes below 50% mod instead of a 5% while your health is above 90% mod, which is...enticing.  That requires you to re-work your gear to not waste all that extra precision though, which is a much longer conversation about gear optimization.
---
For utilities, Signet of Agility and Shadow Step always.  Roll for Initiative or Bandit's Defense in the 3rd slot is safest.  Assassin's Signet to really maximize pushes is greedy, and nice if you can get away with it - but when your defensive cooldowns are down you're super vulnerable to getting stunned and killed, and too high risk to push until they are back up.  I really strongly suggest the second stunbreak unless you're in a really coordinated party where you have consistent stability and the like to let you get away with dropping the 2nd stunbreak.  Popping Assassin's Signet for an extra 15+% damage on pushes is no joke.
---
I have very little sympathy to people who do this.

---
If you get PoF, you just have to play through the first story step of it to get a mount.
---
That being said, I'd recommend doing HoT first just because if you're into the story it makes more sense to do it in order and HoT comes way before PoF, if you jump straight into PoF nothing is going to make sense story wise. Also, HoT has fun metas, and gliding is really cool. 
---
you can not attack while using the wip 
---
Hmm alright, thanks! Might as well get one and see how convenient it is :)
---
Please stop pretending that disagreement is not the primary use of the down vote button. Yes, the reddiquette says it isn't, but cmon... 
---
Just embrace it. Incorrect spelling in the LFG is entertaining af once you accept it.
---
ayyyyy wisconin 
---
Everyday must be a great day for you!
---
So I have exactly enough to buy one of these and I can't afford to get more gems right now. Do I buy this, or gamble with tomorrow in hopes that the Copper-Fed SOM goes on sale for the last day? 
---
People will tell you to do metas, which is technically correct, but honestly these folks are HoT farmers who haven't done the mastery grind in years. Nothing in HoT is fast or easy, it is just as miserable and fraught as it looks from the start. If you need ley-line gliding or forsaken thicket waters for raids, or want to craft a gen2 legi, expect to spend weeks suffering through the same bad content over and over. The whole expansion *is* a grind, that's \*the point\*.
---
With that in mind, I don't have any advice specifically for farming, merely for numbing the experience that is Heart of Thorns. If you can get the gryphon, do that before Verdant Brink, as it makes that map much more bearable. Auric Basin is far less miserable than VB, but neither is as bad as Tangled Depths. For TD, learn quickly to identify the "ramp" icons or inclines on a map, because they're the only way to navigate between floors. Ignore Hero Points unless they're insights. If you can, find map trains. Do not try map completion on your own. Do not dismount; if you lack PoF, get the meta WPs and get out.
---
Personal Story is gated by masteries at several points, so look those up and focus on them, otherwise you WILL hit them and be that much more dissuaded from HoT. If you have a group you do dailies with, try and do one or two HoT metas with them, getting into a routine means you spend as little time in the zone for the highest concentration of EXP. Be warned that dissing on HoT in this subreddit is the fastest way to get "if you don't like it go back to WoW" replies. Good luck.
---
The dodge jump off the Thwomp is the bane of my existence
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/welcome-back-to-guild-wars-2-week-one/

The story, which is also locked behind masteries...
---
Especially since there was that whole kerfluffle about Anet logging peoples' background tasks, and banning people if AHK was running.
---
#1 might be some anet employee when testing those races
---
Might wanna see the eye doctor buddy, this reddit is a cancerous garbage fire, the only reason mods are doing things is because if it gets too much of a shitshow they'll be held responsible. 
---
Out of curiosity, when are these going up? The dodge jump off the Thwomp in 1-1 is the hardest jump in the game for me and it takes too long per attempt to just git gud like the lantern jump in 2-2.
---
Is it April first already?
---
Comeback game weak
---
/gg
---
they're also simply easier overall
---
despite the powercreep of elite specs a lot of dungeon bosses will slap the floor with people while fractal enemies deal no real damage(even at very high tiers their damage is weak af)
---
It's a meta thread. Everyone who responded seriously to OP's post has /gg'd themselves.
---
500 imo is a better ceiling if youre into periodic ascended item crafting and that be all woods, leathers, silks and ores. I really like when i out of blue figure out i need to ascend a particular character and hey, no need to buy a thing! I have everything handy! 
---
Wasn't that the case of spirit watch for the past ~3 years though? 
---
Yes. They said they’re still working on that one in the past year or so. 
---
In -10 li grps i guess
---
Then you join one of those, do one fractal and then everyone leaves because that was the last one they needed.
---
Ah, yeah, love it when some cool dudes don't care and be like "hurr durr who gives a shit, I surely don't and neither should you hurr durr".
---
It's obviously not a major issue, but it's worth pointing out nonetheless.
---
Sounds like pve legy armor tbh.
---
Allowing macros with a certain function is "a bit" different to changing the game setting system. 
---
Also "we allow it" don't mean "we support it". 
---
Champ bags still drop loot according to character level like they did before. So no unid gear on low level characters.
---
There were other programs, not AHK. 
---
Maybe those people were using AHK too, but you know how a fresh banned hacker can argue and change the story for his benefits. What you can read from those people on reddit is mostly not the whole story/truth. 
---
It's done, you can download:-)
---
You're just making this up as you go. I wonder how the "they're just guidelines" defence plays out in, say, English exams.
---
Also, since you seem to like omitting apostrophes wholesale, I guess you're trying to argue that "doesnt" and "its" (non-possessive) are OK too? Even though at least one of those simply means something else entirely? Yeah, you're a supermassive moron and you should be ashamed of advocating such nonsense.
---
Must be from a Frenchie.
---
The only argument you have right now is the fact that i fat fingered an apostrophe on aren't.  Grammar nazi at its finest.
---
The more we accept the abuse of spelling and grammar rules, the more it will become the norm, the harder, or at least more time-consuming it will become to read and correctly parse (understand) what people mean. All these little mistakes have to be corrected by our brains. Sure, we're not talking seconds per mistake, but it adds up more and more and there's just no need for it. So that's why some people still give a shit.
---
REasons to get this guild hall
---
The real question is why does the community down vote every post about build templates?
---
Dirty keyfarmer.
---
Where can I search for a casual guild?
---
Very few languages have strict guidelines on how they're written.  Church Latin and French are the only two i can think of that have governing bodies on their grammar.  Because of this, the poem Beowulf is just as much English as what we speak today.  Including apostrophes in casual writing is pretty rare these days seeing as you can convey the same message with less effort.  Just because school taught you language should be stricter than a gulag doesn't mean it has to be.  If you ever read a book you would notice writers omit or change their grammar all the time to fit the styling of the book.
---
no. the UIG change just simply was a change only affecting lvl 80 loot. everything below is still as it used to be.
---
Ask for help in map chat if you're having trouble with a heart of thorns hero point or look in lfg for any hero point trains.  
---
How much AP did monthlies give? Didn't play when they were a thing.
---
Not really familiar with the SAB gem store releases. Do they add random stuff throughout the event? I've yet to see the chair anywhere.
---
I don’t disagree but this is unreasonably harsh. Don’t berate someone for having a life and missing a video game sale. 
---
When I stepped into Heart of Thorns content the first time, think it was Verdant Brink and ran into the pocket raptors for the first time.  Those little fuckers owned me.  HoT is what made me really learn my skills and class in order to be able to survive there, it's probably still my favorite content in the game.
---
I been dreaming a lot about mini update where they add this as some kind of dungeon and on first playthrough you open the doors between Crystal desert and Ebonhawke. 
---
People's reaction on this comment is hilariously ironic, seeing the comment's context.
---
Yeah, but those cheaper BL weapons tend to have a fairly stable price - around 50-60g per 1-ticket-weapon is pretty much a given for the currently available ones and the stuff that returns frequently.
---
I opened a bunch of bags and tested on a level 80 and a lower chr.  The level 80 got unid gear but the lower did not, it just dropped level appropriate gear.

It is low effort, that's why it doesn't have a ton of upvotes. Just a little something I wanted to share. I think that's a fair trade. And no, just because it's *also* related to English, that doesn't mean it's unrelated to GW2.
---
&gt; As someone who plays on EU servers this is honestly quite bizarre to read, I wonder how many languages you have perfect grammar in besides English OP?
---
Is there a point to this sentence? You'd expect people in this time and age to know English far before you'd expect them to know any other language besides their native one. Especially in an online game.
---
And no, I am not saying they have to know it well.

---
[To what end?](https://i.imgur.com/40Idny0.png?1)  
---
As for grammatical corrections, periods and commas go inside quotations.

&gt; And no, just because it's also related to English, that doesn't mean it's unrelated to GW2.

It is completely unrelated. It's quite literally a post about grammar, that's it.
---
&gt;You'd expect people in this time and age to know English far before you'd expect them to know any other language besides their native one. Especially in an online game.
---
Yikes, the ignorance.
---
It's better, but there are still some discrepancies
---
Most of the characters are getting hit with light from the front, but your front liner (I think that's a warrior?) doesn't seem to be getting hit with any at all for example
---
I also think the spacing might be a little bit too close, it does look a little bit cluttered, but you are doing better with depth perception
---
As a fun project, try seeing if you play with character shadows on the ground. It will give a better perspective of where the ground is
---
Just seems like more of a struggle to me setting a macro to hit shift and space with 2 fingers over v and space with just my thumb lol

Yep, it's just the days of 100g+ per ticket are probably gone

Great drawing!
---
&gt;It is completely unrelated. It's quite literally a post about grammar, that's it.
---
English grammar in game's context.
---
See? That's a small connection right there.
---
Dude everyone can see how frothing at the mouth mad you are. This is such an insanely petty thing to be mad about it is very clear that you are the snowflake here bud.

Cant remember off the top of my head, but I have nearly 5k only from that. They could be done within 2-3 days, the hardest ones for me being WvW ones since my server was always kicking the bucket. Granted, many of them were mindless, but Im a goal oriented person, so I like setting goals and getting carrots for it. I didnt care much about not being top AP, but as long as I was progressing nicely along, I was fine. I feel now that the radiant backpack is only something I could potentially reach 10+ years down the line (if at all!) at the current rate, so to me it might as well not exist, which is not cool because I shouldnt feel a game should become a second job...

People who buy raid boss kill

To no end? Speaking my mind just because.

I know, thanks.
---
&gt;As for grammatical corrections, periods and commas go inside quotations.
---
It is my thought that it's not necessary if they are not a part of an actual quote. Might be wrong but eh.
---
Mesmer as in alone.
---
You want to try looking into how useful group stealth, teleports and getting your groups behind the enemy can be.
---
Given you're enough of a stickler on grammar to make a thread calling out and correcting others' abuse of apostrophes, I'm confused as to why you think punctuation rules are subject to your personal interpretations and subsequently apathetic to correction—unless you're also okay with T4's saying "eh," in which case I don't know why any of this thread exists.
---
A ghostly infusion.
---
Oh look, someone thinks he's better than others just because he can do [insert X stupid reason] in [insert X scenario]!
---
Oh jeez, snowflakes with teeth.
---
&gt;Go back to Star Trek subreddit and be an asshole there.
---
Dude, you can't tell people to go be an asshole somewhere else. It's not like others deserve it.
---
Did they change some of the dig spots? Several of your marks (especially in 201) did not dig up anything, I don't remember that being an issue last year. 
---
In the last one, if you have enough health to afford losing 1 heart, you can jump asap after the 6th coin. You'll respawn on the 7th coin. I just got #63 and #65 like that.
---
Though the hardest part is, by far, clearing the whole place properly before you can actually run, all while each death means you have to wait for automatic teleport back to start (which takes like years while you sweat because you'd be blocked if it doesn't port you), while mistakenly clicking "restart" before it spawns you to a wp means you'll be blocked and have to go out and do it all oever again ... and same if after a fair amount of runs you restart without properly activating the adventure.

When PoF Beta first dropped I was actually waiting by this exit before the patch hit because I was positive this was where the entrance would be... Nope. Boy, did I feel silly.
---
And it's also their style to revitalize it. There's a reason they didn't, and it's likely akin to the maps they wanted didn't fit in with what options Ebonhawke permitted.

Boo-hoo
---
Your comparing human interaction to purchasing a video game. That’s... an interesting angle at the very least. 
---
And yes, I tend to prioritize family time over things like purchasing a game. Especially if I think that game is going to be on sale for a while. 
---
This is all moot anyway, your entire beef seems to be based on the idea that OP is playing the victim. All they did was explain why they didn’t purchase it on sale, and as if it goes on sale often. I wouldn’t call that playing the victim. I’d call that... explaining the situation... and asking a question.

For the average player, gemstore stuff usually isn't about whether or not something is literally worth the cash/gold it costs, it's about convenience.  Many people find it far easier to always have their stuff in the bank so it's easily accessible for crafting or selling, rather than trying to hunt through alt character/guild banks/accounts trying to find something they need.
---
&gt;Humans aren't going around messing things up either.
---
Not anymore. Back in my day we got up to some right shenanigans! Anyone remember that Soul battery Fiasco? no? Damn kids these days.
---
Well anyway, some old drinking buddies almost got Tyria destroyed by stonking great demons from the Foundry of Failed Creations. Took us months to deal with that one, traipsing around obscure bits of the country fighting Titans, sealing magic Doors in volcanoes. As a species we really need stop helping sorcerers with their plans before finding out what they are, or turning up drunk.
---
The worst bit was the local laws in Ascalon that said hunting parties could be no more than Four people! Well, at least Adelbern sent a detachment, back in the days before he completely lost it.

That's what I'll keep doing until there's some new data

He looks depresso expresso

---
Still like it... He isn't permanently angry, more like permanently unimpressed.
---
Ehhh get out of here old man! We're talking 'bout modern times, not back when ritualists roamed Tyria!
---
You sir know your stuff. And explain it so nicely. Thank you for this thorough explanation. 
---
After seven years? I doubt that.

“I dont know why im here”

Please don't remind me. I try to think of that episode as non-canon.
---
Let's not. 
---
Why not?
---
Thank You! that makes sense.

People speculated, with the beetle racing scarf, that it was a precursor to anet adding capes due to the physics behind it.

How did you manage to take no damage on the spike floor?

Got examples?
