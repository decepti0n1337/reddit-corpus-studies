I really like rev lately since war died but feels like vent is new mirage , what u think ? 
---
And for guide if u could add why chose traits over others would help a lot to see ur reasons and compare :)

---
well I have none yet but I may be into wvw in future, Ill pick some high pop one, thanks for the answer :)

If your motivational tumblr posts haven't helped you, it's weird to try them on me. 
---
&gt;Information taken from various sources relying on leaked technical documents.
---
LOL
---
I don't understand 'scholary look for heavy armor class','bulk up armor with light armor class'. Can you show some examples? I've never seen this so i can't imagine what it looks like
---
Verificaste los drivers?
---
I agree with the other commentor, the yellow makes it totally draw your eye and gives it a great atmosphere!
---
Eli5 "Rage Is Sage". I want to read some drama.
---
I haven't played him in a hot minute, but I don't believe the Sylvari racial armor coat clips weapons. 
---
Oo ok thanks alot for all the info :)!
---
Thank you so much for the comment :) 
---
No.  They're tied to achievements, and the upgraded set costs a decent amount to get.
---
Wouldn't call this an unpopular opinion. Most of the characters I play are charr and I've run out of good fashion options for them on all armor weights because I'm tired of using the same pieces over and over because the others either just look bad on charr or have bizarre clipping.
---
It isn't even tail clipping that bothers me. It's much worse when your waist just gets cut in half and there's a small gap in it, or your character's neck just disconnects from your armor. This isn't exclusive to charr, either, it is just much more noticeable on them because of their unique body type. I've seen it on every race but asura, but I don't play them or look at them enough to notice.
---
First piece of armor that came to my mind when these posts about medium armor started coming was exactly this one: My Druid has been rocking the elonian chestpiece for a couple of months now and it is amazing! Also very scholarly like (which some critics said isn't a vibe you can strive for with medium)
---
Do you have set Reflections set to All? This tanked my fps quite a bit on a gtx 1080. I think it was by about 20 while standing above Tarir.
---
Hey dumb bitch. Want to address anyone else's criticisms of you? Or was I fucking correct about everything? Hahahaha. Classic bitch. When the going gets tough you repeat the same thing over and over. No substance at all. But you already know that. 
---
Right... so you didn't actually have a problem with map-wide metas but the timer locks. That's a big difference mate. One can exist without the other - look at Silverwastes. For me, the timer is actually helpful, because I know exactly when a given meta will start - and that's because I usually game fewer days a week but reserve more time over a single session that way, meaning I don't need to stress about waiting for 30 minutes for a meta should I decide to play it. Different players, different playing habits.
---
&gt; he's so bad we can call them victims
---
completely out of the loop, what did OP do?
---
The GW1 art team had [wonderful designs](https://wiki.guildwars.com/images/thumb/6/6e/Warrior_Elite_Kurzick_armor_f.jpg/233px-Warrior_Elite_Kurzick_armor_f.jpg) but they're long gone.
---
Aside from the features, I personally found PoF to be a better expansion overall. Somethin about HoT just didn't hook me, but I was into PoF from the outset. 
---
I think you will be disappointed. For some reason male sylvari don't fill out the ascalonian pants as well as human males do, but it's probably better than embroidered still. Haven't checked if the elegy or requiem pants are better yet, so there might be hope
---
Thanks ! I'm using the Stately headpiece, Acolyte shoulders and pants, Corsair chestpiece, Embroidered gloves and Vigil boots.
---
ty !
---
I personally don't mind them adding lots of cool designs in the gem store, my problem is that they're ALWAYS OUTFITS.
---
Or.... choose a female human and wear T3 armor... underboobs rule!
---
U guys are laughable stock . And for u sage , just make new acc under new name lol . 
---
Ouch I just bought both xpacs yesterday (Dec 31) for full price, no regrets tho lol
---
I'm in favor of the carapace and elegy pieces myself.
---
you still didn't Escape the Acurssed BUTT-CAPES!
---
Why can't my necro wear heavy armour 😭
---
When you're freezing and sweating.
---
always reminds me of https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/lenny-kravitz1.jpg
---
&gt; Not all medium armour is ugly.
---
Ugly is subjective. To me, none of your pics prove your assertion.
---
&gt; Two chronos for every raid. That's been the bread and butter of every raid since their inception.
---
Nope. Totally untrue. Didn't need a second Chrono until after the first nerf wave.
---
Blish 😭

try deleting local.dat
---
literally every cdps berserker i have seen has ended up as the top dps in the squad but ok
---
Couple questions:
---
* Any idea how long this offer will be around?
---
* As a new player how far can I go into the core game, i.e before buying the expansions, without missing out on much?
---

---
Would you draw a human male? Curiosity. 
---
Read comments.
---
Haven't played in absolute ages but I can only assume inflation has been going nuts.
---
Whatever floats your boat man. Grow a pair
---
So does it pay for itself?
---
I'm not expecting anything until the end of LS5.  I really have no idea what ArenaNet meant by introducing features that were reserved for expansions in the past.  It's such a vague and indeterminate statement. 
---
Wow. What a comeback. I'm all emotional right now.

Who tf would give gold to this retarded post 
---
What does that fix? Now we have a world where a magician is looking like a warrior? I mean immersion is already weak but that really makes it worse. Ideally you should be able to identify each class by the armor they wear. This makes sense from both a gameplay perspective, but also a world immersion prospective. I want to look and feel like a necromancer, like a lord of death and decay. It cheapens that feeling of being that class when I cant find any armor pieces unique to me, OR if a warrior for instance was walking around wearing that armor too.

Great minds think alike, my holosmith also wears the same chestpiece [https://imgur.com/Atnc3En](https://imgur.com/Atnc3En)

&gt; I've seen it on every race but asura

That's because asura are so tiny and the camera doesn't allow you to get close enough to look at their fashions XD

Yea there is a decent open world build around that as well as banner builds for fractals and raids. Being an Axe/Axe already puts you in a good spot for knowing that. I took a break right when Ascended gear was introduced and just came back around October it was tough but just take your time and have fun.
---
I just wish there was a version of the scarf that isn't that bulky.

[I tried using it on my guardian](https://imgur.com/xptjD0f), and if the scarf was about half the size it is now I'd actually be really happy with it

If you're on a US server, [EVA] does all HoT metas every day. They always have ads up in LFG.

---
Way too much repressed hate for one another
---
But god damm this posts only deserve one answer: Who cares? 
---
Im awate it can be done, but no one fucking does it because the npc is still. Broken.
---
I mean it's interesting in the fact that upvoting someone saying I don't care is just anonymously agreeing, in the same way, upvoting we don't care carries the same message. 
---
&gt; promotes passive play
---
You are playing Guild Wars 2.
---
So far it seems like Anet can't split target caps between game modes. But of course in the future being able to do this would open up new opportunities.
---
Oh man, that last bit of grind at the end hurts a little more every game xD
---
Character select screen, it should be somewhere under the name
---
Run bootcamp. Wiblndows 10 free to download and install. Only watermark if you dont pay. 
---
Went from 30fps to 50+. Well worth it imo
---
The racing scarves aren't nearly as bulky.
---
If you buy it make sure to go into your personal story and buy living world season 4 episode 3.  It was free but I still had to go into the menu and purchase it for 0 gems.  You will get episode 4 when you log in.
---
In the bottom left of the character select screen under your characters name is the server you are on. At the bottom of the box
---
Well, thats because two people wearing the same thing side by side sure bring people's attention!
---
I think the real reason for why they haven't done this yet is cause of WvW/PvP and of course a bit powercreep in PvE. They don't seem to be able to split target caps on different skills between the 3 game modes.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
They didn't want us playing the UI game of the chrono swapping back and forth between the sub squads. Instead we have to play the ui game of making sure boons are covered for everyone by correct sub squads
---
Can anything truly handle 70v70v70?
---
Necro staff is for utility. So if you are using it to yourself or other players alive it's fine. 2 is a heal for friends, 3&amp;5 are CCs, and 4 is a condi cleanse.
---
Also unless you're specifically playing with your friend in WvW, the server doesn't matter aside from the NA or EU servers. Open world has them all combined.
---
What does this mean? I feel very out of the loop here, I have no Idea who this person is.
---
Do you have the expansions? Elite specs? What game mode is this for? Staff is great in PvP it's just not that good in PvE due to low DPS and group utility.
---
Hope the food was good! She's supposed to be [Inquest](https://imgur.com/vkqTDjA) so if you can nail that smug sense of superiority it'd be the best thing to happen this year.
---
You wanna start playing something. Play rifle holo. Not that much harder but Is quite fun and brings a lot of cc to the table which is quite needed after the cc nerf on chrono 
---
First time I'm seeing this. It's a great video but like most anet announcements slightly obscure
---
Copper fed will always be best in slot for fine (blue) gear. Masterwork (green) gear is now very slightly more worthwhile in the runecrafter and rares (yellow) are still best with [mystic salvage kits](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Salvage_Kit) though this could change as the price of rune mats goes up or the price of ectos goes down.
---
No, the boost is once per expansion. If you already have PoF you can't redeem PoF again and even then you already have the slot unlock.
---
I'd be super appreciative if you could draw my Asura, Ooleg Alpha, he's been my main for years and I adore your artstyle!

HoT will be infinitely easier and possibly more enjoyable for you because you have mounts.
---
Uh, no. People literally whined that it was 'too hard' and Anet caved to them and effectively neutered every single aspect of HoT.
---
Hehe, she was indirectly insulting her face. 
---
She is a chrono so she's wearing light armour .. can't wait to see yours!!! 😄

I linked it above, but they HAVE said why.

---
it largely consists of armor rigging limitations making the pieces actually impossible to just port across.  They would have to completely redesign and re-rig each piece to make it work, which accounts for literal thousands of pieces now, across each race and gender.
---
Perma bans are real.
---
As someone who just redid the HoT maps 6 times in 4 days, after not having touched them since I initially completed them, this is completely incorrect. Every HoT map is easy mode with mounts. It takes literally about 20-30 minutes to do verdant brink as long as you can grab a few people for 2 or 3 of the harder hero points (golem, vampire, and frog).
---
Congrats ^^
---
Like everyone else says, you should be able to join their instance by right-clicking their portrait in bottom-left corner and get an option for it. Also keep in mind, different races start at different zones, I think you need to be in the same zone to join up with him.
---
What a great tool, thanks for sharing 
---
You don't care so much you posted about it?
---
In open world it's not actually that clear.  Even if it's not necessarily true, the speed that holo PLAYS and that it's weapon skills and otherwise execute can easily give the perception/appearance that it's damage is higher.  It's a little bit about impact... it FEELS more like you are doing more when running the engineer because it's easier to confuse actions per second with damage per second.  
---
Instead of JUST telling him that one is better than the other and his opinions are silly, It would be better to explain to him that while Guardian's weapon skills do all activate just a little slower than other classes, Guardian is capable of laying down a lot of heavy-hitting AoEs all at the same time in order to have multiple high damage ticking packets all doing damage at once... and not just to a single enemy like Kitless Engi damage is focused.  Between swords, trap symbol and whirl on greatsword, you put down a lot of damage very quickly and over a decent sized radius and it can clear mob groupings more safely and quickly than the engi.  
---
This is why said engi actually feels more squishy despite higher HP.  It clears a single target well enough, but you still have multiple other targets hitting you.  Guard clears all individuals slightly slower, but hits them all at the same time.  That means overall, all of them die sooner, and hit you fewer times.
---

---
Right. To kind of try and set this straight...
---
I don't think anyone will deny that fessing up and genuinely repenting is a good thing.  
---
But you have to realise, full well, that you've done this before. You've attempted to apologise, and repent, and when given a chance you ended up exploding at people again.  
---
I'm someone who believes in people changing their ways for the better. But as many have said here, the further is also that words are easier and actions are hard.   
---
As probably the last person in our little RP community to have genuinely thrown the towel in on this - if you truly plan on improving your ways, that's nothing but commendable. But I'm afraid you'll have to realise you will face hostility and distrust, and you've given people a lot of reason to distrust you. And, quite frankly, done some crazy stuff.  
---
And if you genuinely mean this endeavour you're going to have to have the strength to face that and make better bonds as a better person with other people.
---
It will take a lot of time, goodwill... And a whole, whole lot of controlling your temper.  
---
And at this point only time can tell whether that investment is genuinely there.

I’ve seen it happen. It wasn’t pretty.  I’m a changed raider after seeing that.
---
Lyssa is, literally, two-faced. Her element is chaos. I can see her being sympathetic enough to help Balthazar and curious enough to see what would happen if he failed.
---
I couldn't imagine bulk salvaging, not for as long as minor runes and sigils go for 10+ silver quite a lot of the time. So the only difference between runemaster and silver-fed, to me, is that I got 5% higher chance for rare materials on the silver-fed, but pay 30 copper instead of 60 on the runemaster's.
---
That's...difficult.
---
But then again. 5% higher chance. Is that even noticable? At least 30 coppers add up. Bunch of rares and you got a few silver. Greens get fed to the copper-fed anyway, after I'm done picking them clean with the endless extractor.
---
30 copper per use? I'll take it.
---
Let's have a go at it then.

Hogwash. 
---
the scarf is intentional on the charr as she's named Generic Anime Charr. She's generic as possible. The scarf is on my deadeye named Hired Mercenary because all the actual hoods suck and I wanted a kind of "hood-down" look and that thing is the only real way to do that. I love scarves, I just wish there was more friggin variety in those.

hype!

Yes and no
---
In other games like league for example 
---
There are high amount of high elo. So you don’t lose ratings like this
---
Gw2 has low amount of high tier ppl 
---
I’m curious too, it must have been really bad if his account got terminated/banned.
---
I don't get what your problem is to start with. Do the recomended and you have the pots for tier 4 fracals. You do not need pots for the recomanded so you pick them up and now you have them and you lost nothing but gained a lot.
---
Soulbeast rotations are much simpler with either positioning being important (Condition builds using shortbow) or a simple rotation of weapon and utility skills with a few important windows to be aware of (Power builds and properly using Sic'em and Maul's damage boosts).
---
I see... that isn’t fun for the low tier as well :b
---
&gt; let us transmute anything
---
THIS. We could mix-n-match Plate-Chain-Leather-Cloth in Rift and it was the best fashion wars in my opinion (too bad the game was destroyed by greedy devs). Sure, there were clipping issues but people found combos that worked perfectly. Creativity is the key.
---
It is still a teameffort.
---
When teaming up with my friends we usually got a better winratio, since we can better coordinate caps, decaps etc. :)
---
But can not see how I can carry a team, while still being mediocore.. maybe silver is just my league :) 
---
If you do not have the option to move to the other persons instance or him to yours then you are on different regions. NA and EU can not play together, you can party up and talk to eachother but not join eachothers instance because the severs are on different spots in the world.
---
If you let me know the server names for both of you (go to your log in screen and check the bottom left corner, there should be a server name) and i can tell you if this is the issue.

I mean the only time it is profitable to salvage a green is for elderwood (talking lvl 80 salvage here, lower levels salvaging all gear is profitable ofcourse). Greens sell for 1.6-2.0s to vendor. You have to get pretty lucky with salvage to get profit since silk, mithril and leather are below 60c from TP. Even with the new salvage kit you have 0.03% chance (from wiki) to get a charm or chasm. You could get lucky but in the long run it is not worth it. Especially with any other kit.
---
Uhhhh... lets trade platitudes. You could also say your statement is a self-fulfilling argument. You are expecting a dunning-kruger to rear its head et voila you found one... or did you?
---
Oh of course its a team effort. Sometimes you simply cant win. However, for the majority of the time, I am sure that you (or you + a friend) can carry a team with good rotations/communication. If you're going to duo queue, I'd look to specifically play two classes that synergize well (support FB + condi Scourge, for example)
---
Have they ever come out in a dev blog or anything and said why they rebuilt it the way that they did?
---
Should I spend the money on salvage kits to salvage my extra ascended trinkets, or should I just sell them to the merchant? I haven't gotten nearly enough salvage kits from drops.
---
&gt; New players do not have that kind of currency. 
---
New player also do not have ascended gear. Or good runes/sigils, or legendary weapons, or alls LS parts, or endless other things. That's the point of being a new player, that you haven't played the game much yet...
---
And still every new player *can get* all these things.
---

Yeah, I'm a pretty blatant edgelord when it comes to MMOs. Thief + Endless variety of trenchcoats and buttcapes, and it's like I'm in a buffet.

Agreed about the boots. I swear, it's either slippers, homeless or elf shoes.
---
they all have the same eye shape and jaw structure, and nose. if you make variations on those you'll have more definitive faces.

Nah.  Without an option to disable it, it'd be a nuisance. 
---
He has to be above or around 1800 rating, Im currently legend and i ALWAYS get 1-7 points per game (depending on the rating of the players matched against me). Generally losing around 20ish points per loss, sometimes even way higher than that.

I don't know how I got around before mounts.
---
I literally chose classes (pre-PoF) around who could keep swiftness up the most for running around the world!
---
Not sure who he would need to speak to, considering Chris dropped his reddit account.  I hope he's still in contact with someone.
---

---

---
Since he's logged now, he already has those unlocked already. Just need to buy PoF to access them, so he can get PoF anytime and still have access to them.
---
potions are an incentive to do daily recs with the infinites being rewards for dedicated players.
---
15% increased damage, increased movement speed, reduced incoming speed, and bonus precision/concentration/toughness are no joke. you're crippling yourself by choosing not to use them. 
---
This is adorable. 
---
I still prefer GW2Efficiency, personally. 
---
RL stalking, doxxing, death threats, some serious psychological threatening... Alot of things. Manipulation to the point of turning people on eachother and ruining relationships too 
---
Salvages, not destroys. 
---
Still working on mine. T3/T4. Been T3 since the third season. I really can't get into PvP, but I so want a second legendary backpack (yes, I'm also working, ever so slowly, on the WvW one).
---
And then they go and add more armor skins I want. Sigh.
---
they're separate. HoT is the first one, so in the story it's chronologically before PoF, and takes place after the base game. Each introduces new maps and mechanics, and while you don't need both, the content for each one is locked behind purchasing that expansion. so only having HoT means you can't play PoF content and vice versa
---
Yea they have it in SWTOR, you don’t have to accept the duel if you don’t want to, brings a nice break from the monotony of map completion, so yes it’d be nice to have.
---
Well copper-fed vs runecrafter's is 20% vs 100% to get materials from the rune/sigil...how is that "slightly better"? You have guaranteed motes and guaranteed roll against charm/symbols, that would happen only once in five times with copper-fed. 
---
For blue/lower it is no change at all as there is no upgrade to salvage (unless you put some in) and thus there is zero justification to switch from copper-fed.
---
First you could have searched a bit harder because there has already been "a few" threads about that on the forum and on Reddit with the most recent one being [less than a month old](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/a6dof2/how_about_a_duel_system/).
---
Then I'll repeat what I also posted there:
---
You have vastly different gear and traits in PvP/WvW compared to PvE so you will probably either find
---
* a PvP/WvW Roamer player that has an adequate build (but then you could also have gone to one of the PvP duel custom arenas that exist)
---
* a PvE player with only PvE gear on them and then how would fight even be fair?
---
* a PvE player that has to put on specific WvW gear and traits just to make a duel and then go on with their business (so without build template count 20-30 sec at least to swap to WvW gear and then back to PvE another 20-30 sec)
---
I'm not sure this would that great tbh :p
---
Also PvE balance vs PvP/WvW balance :p (confusion, retaliation, strength/CD of some powerful skills). If you wanna duel go in dedicated PvP Custom Arenas (or dedicated WvW spots if the time is right) you'll find people who are there for that exact purpose.
---
This game has a ton of casual players that want nothing to do with player vs. player and find the entire concept revolting.  The last thing they would want is someone chasing them down for duels and spamming requests.  It'd just be another way to troll someone.  I understand the appeal of wanting to duel people in different varying environments, but WvW will just have to suffice. 
---
Nothing much to add.  I just wanted to add that your fashion wars is pretty top notch.  I'm not really a huge fan of the shiny draw but your dye scheme is really cool. 
---
Elite Specs are gated from free-to-play players using expansions. Personally, from a technical point of view, I find it enormously unlikely they will (or can) release Elite Specs with Living World, not to mention an acceptable release schedule for both players and developers.
---
Late reply but it did work in the past. A change they effected a number of months ago made it so that only stealth applied by actual thief skills will have the increased duration, which excludes combo finishers.
---
They are totally independent, you don't need HoT if you only want PoF for example. However for the story the chronological order is HoT --&gt; Living World Season 3 --&gt; PoF.
---
Drop rate is good. Only the size of people's material storage is too big so nobody sells.
---
Jeah. That's about right. More charr themed armor and weapons would be nice.
---
Hammer 2 is pretty large burst. It is used for the burst builds in PvP and WvW for that purpose.
---
It means that events are not permanent on a zone and they "spawn", time travel to 2012 and see how you could assault Balth's temple and then have to defend it if you succeeded, even now we have "current events" that spawn around tyria. LOL daed gaem ikr /s (if it wasn't clear)
---
Thanks! Little crazy is never bad.
---
I just use it. Who cares lol the main reason to get it is to not have to lug around tons of different Salvage kits 
---
Just buy outfits lmao ^^//s
---
For real though it fucking sucks that this will never be fully addressed to a significant amount. We're lucky to get ONE set of armor for each type every LS update, and maybe 3 for each expansion. To make any meaningful impact on FashionWars we'd need all new sets to be ambiguous. When there's 100 sets and only ~8 don't look exceedingly heavy/medium/light, that's not enough variety.
---
The logic is that there need not be such a system because it's what custom arenas in sPVP &amp; the entirety of WvW/Roaming is for. 
---
Lol, bronze 80 pvp lvl man, play more, see comps..can give you few screenshots with wispers.. what you prefer win game or some gold ..or bots who play 1600 game in 1 season in freandlist, sooo....
---
'There need not be a system' can be said about a lot of things. This is just something that would be icing on the cake, would only add an additional fun factor to the game, and would not negatively impact others who have no interest in PvP. Don't see a reason why we should instantaneously shrug off the concept and act like its something repulsive.
---
"Do you people don't have guilds?"
---
you literally cant think of going to pvp arena to play pvp?
---
Exactly what I am trying to say. It's something fun that doesn't have to be taken seriously (this is in regards to people complaining about balance) and doesn't harm people who have no interest in PvP. And if anything, may even introduce people into PvP.
---
If you are going to answer like a 12 year old, I don't want to debate with you.
---
If you can't craft for yourself from what you get, how the drop rate is good?
---
Steallar job mate! Our Krewe is coming along quite beautifully!
---
Are you really that lazy that if you want to 1v1 someone you're with, you can't hit "enter pvp" at the top of the screen?
---
&gt;Good content is something people want to repeat? 
---
Hell yes, especially in MMOs. If you don't want to do it more than once, it's useless and redundant -- and more importantly, a waste of time by the devs who made an effort for it.
---
&gt;I think you've struck the core of the problem that guild wars 2 has. 
---
There are many problems GW2 has, both in-game and in-community. 'Players thinking their ideas are the best thing since sliced bread' is one of the most common.
---
&gt;I don't think you can argue that adding this would subtract from this game's "good" and "repeatable" content.
---
It will if you insist that the devs work on implementing it.
---
"Unpolular opinion" yet it is top page right now.
---
In the event that you plan to continue tomorrow, here's mine. Sorry for bad lighting but I'm not great at screenshots. https://i.imgur.com/yX1utCs.jpg
---
I'm sorry I wasn't clear. I repeated what you said because what you said is true, but gw2 is not able to say it does that well. Guild wars 2's content is not repeatable, I don't think it can be brought up as a counterargument. Regarding the resources...were you also against them having people work on the public arena in the pvp lobby? Cause that required some resources. And I hope you are aware that 100% of the development team is not working the precious content you seem to protect so defensively.
---
I think you are tunnel visioning on one scenario that you believe may be an outcome of this addition to the game. Saying it is not fun for the losing end makes absolutely no sense. If you are not going to enjoy dueling don't do it. You are in no way obliged to take part in this content. What you said is like me saying jumping puzzles are designed to be hard, do you think it would be remotely fun for me to participate in them? Adding duels would just be something to do for fun between friends or a random you've met. I don't understand why it has to be so competitive and why it has to be construed in a way that makes it seem the loser should feel morally destroyed and angered for losing.
---
Aye, there already are some stuffs, but none of those actually effect people around you. People can choose to ignore it, or simply lower their settings to not even see it. But when it comes to open world PvP it WILL effect everyone, no matter how you twist and turn it, since it will effect the performance of the game. 
---
And what reward do you get out of those activities you listed that make people want to go back and do them? It's fake repeatable content. If you want to make the argument that fractals makes you gold so it's good to repeat, I'll accept that.
---
I really don't get the resource argument. At the end of the day you have to see that Anet is not some small indie developer team. They have resources. They have employees. They can do the things they deem necessary. And sure I can see them deeming this necessary. I'm just putting my idea out there.
---
I have to admit that this is something that bothers me quite a bit with Gw2.
---
I understand the technical limitations. I don't quite understand why they couldn't make some part of the trenchcoat mesh invisible but I'm not a technical artist either. 
---
I feel that overall all weight classes suffer. It's difficult to adequately verbalize how I feel but in a sense I feel a lot of the pieces feel over developed. That's a lot of feels in one sentence because art and style are so very subjective. My idea is that if we had a few more basic normal pieces the other stuff would stand out more. As it stands right now, every individual armor piece is screaming for you to look at first. But that's not how fashion works in my opinion. 
---
I also don't like outfits. I understand other people like them but to me outfits are boring. I prefer to buy the actual armor skins in the gem store because they are more fun to play with. Outfits are too much a 1 click deal to be fun, to me. 
---
In the end I just have to ask, why is it so hard to get a few normal pants skins? Or a few standard fantasy chest skins? 
---
Explore some asuran tech for armor perhaps. 
---
Are you referring to the list in Fractals of the Mists or the one under Daily?
---
The Daily uses the API while the FOTM list is hard-coded. The latter might have time stamp issues because of the new year or something. 
---
Chronomancer Question: should I use the quickness well or the alacrity well, if I only have room for one?
---
Thanks!
---
I think we misunderstand each other. This is not open world PvP. I was suggesting the implementation of a duel system where you can challenge another to a duel and they can choose to accept it and thus you have a 1v1. Not Black Desert Online open world PvP.
---
Theres indeed always toxicity even in Guild Wars, but in this game its consirderably less then in other MMORPGs. Tbh, I've never had the need to block someone, so I don't even know how to and if you can. 
---
And on being able to see both sides of the coin. Like my grandma always used to say: "If you can only see the bad sides in life then you're probably a bad side yourself." There almost no idea that doesn't have both pros and cons.
---
But it is still open world, and it will still effect other people. 
---
You should be getting one symbol/charm per each ~50 motes. And you get at least one mote from every item that had rune/sigil (with a chance of 20% with copper-fed, 80% of silver-fed, and 100% with the new one). So it basically takes roughly 2000 items to get 6 pieces of each charm/symbol (with silver-fed/rune-fed, while it takes 5 times more if you salvage green items by copper-fed!). Well now it all depends on how much you play and how much you do HoT metas. Have in mind that PoF is way worse for this (rip Istan farm), because there are no upgrades in most of the loot from unidentified gear (sunspear weapons for example), thus lowering the amount of usable salvage rolls.
---
For example I played a lot of HoT (was doing HOPE collection) in last 3 days and I can say that I did salvaged 1500 items in this time window (checked gw2effi). While many of those items were only white/blue thus not countable into the amount mentioned earlier, you can easily see that if you are active enough, you will get resources quite easily. However it is not for everyday crafting and changing runes, you are quite forced to stick with one set. Or finally get that legendary armor, as its usable value skyrocketted with this system.
---
It's probably about the Living World AND dynamic events. There was a point when we would get a new Living World every 2 weeks. That was a lot of new things, honestly.
---
&gt;And what reward do you get out of those activities you listed that make people want to go back and do them? It's fake repeatable content. If you want to make the argument that fractals makes you gold so it's good to repeat, I'll accept that.
---
The Wiki literally lists them. Simple answer, loot (which includes gold). And yes, loot is very persuasive in convincing people to repeat content. You can call it 'fake' all you want, but people are still doing it. Repeatable is repeatable, no matter how 'fake' you think it is. People like having an incentive to do things. Why should getting an incentive for repeating content be any less real?
---
&gt;I really don't get the resource argument. At the end of the day you have to see that Anet is not some small indie developer team. They have resources. They have employees. They can do the things they deem necessary. And sure I can see them deeming this necessary. I'm just putting my idea out there.
---
They are also not Blizzard. They have resources -- and it can *still* be optimized by not doing everything the community wants every time a lightbulb appears in their brains. If they wanted to do this, they have had 6 years, going on 7 to do so. They have not. 
---
If you were just putting your idea 'out there', you'd be a lot more open to criticism. Instead, you're looking to argue more often than not. Since I don't want to get into that mindless loop either, I'll be stopping with this comment -- I've said all that needs to be said.
---
ok good to know that I wasn't imagining this 
---
Convert gold to get 400 more gems, and buy [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Copper-Fed_Salvage-o-Matic).
---
Forget LW2 rewards. I think a bag slot or a bank tab expansion have the highest priority.
---
Why not go druid?
---
Not possible on F2P accounts.
---
I would if I didn't always have those shard things to make mystic salvage kits. Mystic kits are way cheaper and they have 250 uses so I only need one per character.
---
No, but mystic salvage kits are cheaper as long as I have those shards.
---
TIL.
---
Then get a core i7 or i9
---
What are those gift of sigil/rune? Couldnt find the leak... Any details on this one? 
---
It's not a technical limitation. Armor types do have different skeletons but that only means you can't equip a light and a medium piece at the same time.
---
Nothing is preventing ANet from adding armored pieces to light or medium equipment (look at Glorious and Triumphant) or non-armored ones to heavy. It's their choice entirely and they've been criticised for it multiple times in the past. 
---
For raids Quickness Well 100% because Shield 5 has no target cap so running 2 Chronomancers means you get ToT on 10 targets twice. 
---
TW is mostly here to kick-start quickness at the beginning of a fight/phase and to smooth out the uptime but then after that SoI and WoA are your only sources for Quickness while you'd still have ToT on a 25 sec CD for Alacrity on both Chronos.
---
With 50% BD
---
* WoA = 7.5 sec on 5 people on a 25 sec CD
---
* ToT = 6 sec on 10 people on a 30 sec CD, so assuming the ToT of both Chronos hit everybody it's 12 seconds on 10 people every 30 sec
---
If this would have been their main priority they would never have implemented legendary sigil swap on weapons. In the world of soonish full legendary gear it's easy to make a complete set of usegul upgrades and enjoy the new salvage situation as the inventory clutter really feels better now. 
---
I remember seeing a screenshot, but forgot where.
---
Sorry.
---
I'm not doing this to make up rumors. Maybe it's the Mandela Effect?
---
Yeah, I missed the BlackFriday50 promo. Guess I'll pull the trigger now, since the code works. Thanks!
---
Anet said that they want Fractals to be the place where you can have the most vertical progression, so Potions, Mist Attunement ranks, being able to use consumables (like Xera's portal, Metal Rod, etc) are all part of that progression.
---
You can also have 1 free set of Big fractal potions with the Daily Recommended fractals to you only "lose" relics if you intended to convert those potions in relics right away. If not, simply use your potions for the T3/T4s (and start by the CM(s) if you wanna be sure to have them there), go do the recs and now you have your potions for the next day (or do it the other way around, you do you).
---
I've used pots everytime and refreshing them for poor runs while exchanging my relics for 140+ clovers before finally getting all infinite pots.
---
I think I would be a selfish person if I saved that few relics just so that I could get my stuff sooner. I would be wasting everyone else's time by dealing 25% less dmg and taking more dmg and even more from slow movement stressing out my healer.
---
And since I could do this I always insist on kicking those pugs who don't out of our group. We don't even boot those 2k dps slb while everyone else is doing 15k. As long as you pot and food we take it as you show some effort and commitment. We once ran 7 laps for that underground fractal when we usually just needed 1 cauldron. We just don't carry for free.
---
Start your own chill run stating no pots required if you have a problem with it. I'm sure you will get like minded people to join you. Do some open world farming while waiting maybe. 
---
I agree with you, duels could be fun and for the duel spam... just put a check box in the settings to auto decline incoming duel requests. You could even have this be the default option. Question is if the time spent would be more worth elsewhere.
---
Thanks for advice, but bagspace is just convinience for me, I don't really feel like I NEED more than I have.
---
Is there really nothing useful in LW2 for a hobo? e.g. any ascended equipment with useful stats?
---
That will remain a wild guess until people will do real tests or advanced calculations.
---
Yea sure, let's make all looks accessible via all armor types because who wants class fantasy, right?

&gt; You want that PvP Legendary Armor? We're going to shove PvE down your throat.
---
Well, I want legendary weapons, and I get WvW shoved down my throat too.
---
Tangled depths and verdant brink is the best maps in the game. I agree with this boi here.
---
Does it have to be a single class?
---
For open world content of any sort I find the daredevil to be superior for my playstyle at least. You get mobility(in combat more importantly) and with staff/p&amp;p you get decent dps both single target and aoe and the most important part in my opinion is that you get healed for a % (15 I think) of your critical damage. Practically you have to fuck up royally to die.
---
Havent played any fractals in a long time, so cant help with that too much but here: [https://discretize.eu/builds](https://discretize.eu/builds) Daredevil and Deadeye are listed as great builds so you can think about that as well :)
---
If it is strictly between dragonhunter and holo I would choose DH because I ve played it a lot and am used to it and generally feels stronger to me. But if you dont like it doesnt sound like a good idea to force yourself into it.
---
Best of luck!
---
Others are right that it depends on the group. Healer scrapper is a thing, it has incredible res potential and calculated the highest healing output if you have all boons. This is all rather unnecessary though because raid groups even new ones won't need that much healing/ressing. 
---
this is so cuteee by all means. i'll just drop one in hope you'd draw him. can't get a proper pic of him. https://gyazo.com/fe7c6367d8a902fce18dfac6e6759352

At least there were Glint followers holding the Branded back, so it *kind* of made sense. Though I'm not sure so little were supposed to come at you.
---
&gt; but they were constantly pulled and aggro'd by the ghosts.
---
So the NPCs actually served the function they promised... huh... that's a new sort of immersive.
---
I think that the best way is to get rid of your "F2P" status. Especially if you really like the game and play it a lot. You can get HoT for like 5-10€ if you find some discount (but be sure to use official retailers only), and that should be affordable for anyone who spends their time to play computer games. Especially when it is one-time cost.
---
The added value of even just that is immense. Not only you can actually convert more gold to gems, but you get so much new content, 5 character slots instead of 2, you can talk in map chat...use even trading post fully...
---
Consider it. It is worth it. After all, 400 gems on their own are really like...getting one item.
---
I think that may be a little too far up there lol
---
I hope its not too late!

Hi, everyone is talking about this new Diviner prefix that is supposedly hitting live servers next Tuesday, and I know Anet officially announced "a new stat line" that should be coming in "early 2019", but... How can people be so sure it'll be this, did I miss some official statement somewhere?
---
They don’t have Authenticator. That’s why it’s important to set those up right. 
---
Just swapping that one traitline from DH to FB and the trap to quickness mantra, I was losing ~10k on golem dps. That's with full berserkers + Scholar, I don't even want to think about how horrible that would be with Diviners mixed in for boon duration. Other than that, the DPS loss for a Renegade won't be as severe, but Renegade still doesn't compliment Power damage builds at all, it's just that Herald didn't offer a ton in terms of modifiers to begin with and it's damage is quite low anyway. 
---
Chrono for raids is stil locked to Inspiration for raids, in fractals this would certainly have more of an impact if you take Illusions/Dueling. 
---
Most other classes don't have reasonable amount of boon output to make this worth considering, the essential boons are covered by those three classes and your Druid anyway.
---
I would have been happy if we got a triple stat Power++/Con+/Ferocity+ instead to run on DHs for instance, as you're overloaded with crit already as is and it would help with Retaliation uptimes. Same with Danger Time Power Chronos etc.
---
Make cultural armor available for every race, and then there’s 45 sets opened up to everyone in the wardrobe.
---
In open world, I think both of them have some advantages and disadvantages. Concerning raids, I more or less agree. DH has a slightly higher dps ceiling than kitless holo, but kitless has a more simple and forgiving rotation. In my experience playing kitless and a friend playing DH in a pretty average static, the holo build usually beats the DH in actual raids.
---
Unranked dayli prob xD
---
You can take a look at the list of [Stat Attributes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Attribute_combinations#Three_or_more_attributes) on the wiki and filter only for PvP stats and look for those that only have a check on the PvP column.
---
It looks like there are 13 unique PvP stats (and 12 after this patch if no new PvP stat appears). You also have ~25 stats that are only available in PvE and not in PvP.
---
I don't think plat 3 is unranked.
---
I feel the same as you. Specially since the only way they could look sort of OK its if you paint them black or white, which is f-ing expensive.
---
TL;DR? 
---
Engineer has way more self quickness than that if you're playing SD/Kinetic Battery
---
I seem to be living under a rock. When did we find out what the new diviner gear stats were? Is is just berserker with concentration added as a main stat?
---
A lot of people talking about loss of dps here and I would like to point out that you would not run diviner on your dps class you would run it on your support to maximize dps and boon output at the same time. Probably know this already but you can not compare it to berserker you have to compare it to things like harrier, commander and minstrel for comparison 
---
Yep, it used to happen about 6 months ago for me.  It's recently started happening again, although now I'm on a new PC so have no reference for when.
---
You can see it pretty clearly when you run GW2 with the -mapLoadInfo command line parameter.  The in-game FPS counter it shows will tank down to the 6-15 FPS range while loading, which simply as you say, you can alt-tab (even with no window in the background, ie: alt-tab back to the game itself) and that loading screen FPS will shoot back up to ~60 fps.
---
It's annoying, but just something to live with.  Nothing I've tried seems to effect it, ie: focus assist is completely off, latest drivers, etc.  Running a 1080 also on a new 9700k.
---
On my alt account... I have my Jennah clone dressed in, and using exclusively, White Mantle clothing.  She is a mesmer, too, for the best play on that theme.
---
There are a few points that you missed in all of this, but the totally change up what you just came up with.
---
First, let's tackle Glint.
---
Her legacy was to kill the Elder Dragons in a long timespan and let her and her offspring take the roles of regulators of magical balance in Tyria. From what we learned in Path of Fire, her visions did not show her the result of battle with Kralkatorrik, so she put all bets on winning with Destiny's Edge help. She couldn't actually run for long, Kralk would be able to reach her sooner or later so he had to be stopped before branding half of Tyria in pursuit of her. That's not suicide, nor cowardice.
---
Aurene's visions showed her demise in multiple scenarios. There most certainly is something that can change it, and we're gonna know what it is in Thunderhead Keep. Otherwise the Commander wouldn't rally all the allied forces of Pact, Olmakhan, and Elona just to send them on a mission that gets them killed. Commander would never put Aurene to death willingly, which likely means that the tables will turn. The name of upgradable 'Dragonsblood" weapon set point to a theory that there is another Dragonsblood weapon (like the spear that was forged to kill Kralk), possibly made from crystallized blood that Caithe collected after Destiny's Edge failed.
---
It's not Phlunt who ran the simulation regarding the effect of two dragon deaths on Tyria, but Taimi.
---
Just scraped the surface here, maybe Varorson will chime in with some opinions on this later, i'm at work now so don';t have much time for a longer analysis.
---
More people using this salvager = more charms+symbols generated which will increase supply and bring the prices down.
---
We're not talking about "valuable items" (which are things like ectos, dark matter etc), we're talking about the chances that an item's rune/sigil will be salvaged.
---
Silver-fed had a 80% chance to salvage the rune, which had a 0.02-0.08 chance of getting a charm/symbol out (depending on the rune/sigil quality)  The new kit has a 100% chance of salvaging the rune, so you're hitting that 0.02-0.08 chance every time instead of 80% of the time.
---
It's been said elsewhere (sorry i can't find a link for it) that the type of kit you use has no bearing on the output of salvaging a rune. The output is determined by rune quality.

Couldn't decide which one I liked best, so if I'm lucky enough to get her drawn up, then you choose! Amazing post by the way :D &lt;3
---
Diviner exists already in game as a PvP amulet. The stats are Major Power, Major Concentration, Minor precision, and minor ferocity.

awesome art! pls draw my Chucky!

---
As an aside, I took an alt down to bronze so I could see these bots for myself, and it's so far been just bad players straight from pve who can't do anything right. Either way, you could legit 1v3 them, it's insane, you have to try to be that bad. If you still have some good reaction time and know basic rotations with a proper build you should have 0 trouble in this game getting to plat, and thus out of the botters/afkers. 
---
As a pretty new player POF story was way better than HOT. Also mounts are pretty nice upgrade.
---
Unfortunately so :(
---
SMS 2fa isn't great. It'd be nice if more companies supported U2F or Fido going forwards.
---
And that’s is why you ate in higher ranks;) you have probably played against them though.
---
I asked for help on map chat and 5 people came. It's doable.
---
Same problem I'd like an invite too
---
I'm not paying with cash, I'm not that rich :P and saving up gold took a long time due to my schedule. Don't really want more characters after having one of each profession.
---
Guard is definitely stronger as power option, especially dragonhunter. Everything works for t1/t2 though because it's quite fast and easy to clear.
---
Super Sayan Sylvari.
---
Pretty happy with the amount of master race character art that's been popping up.
---
This looks really sick, mate. Nice work on the armor. And that... smile? Can Charr even smile? Does a puppy die every time?
---
It's a game that has been played by at least 8 million people. Chances are at least some of them also have Gw2 accounts, which are in danger of being compromised if they used the same password.
---
I hate how the text is just not straight on this part of this episode, or are my eyes just really bad?
---
And look the most generic you possibly could as tuat would limit your customization to dyea only
---
&gt;Like, I'd absolutely love more heavy armour with buttcapes and more medium/light armour without. But if you're partial to anything other than short metal skirts or plain armoured leggings for heavy, you only have 6-7 decent options out of nearly 80 skins.
---
Are you talking about male heavy armor here? Because I have the opposite problem with female heavy armor on the three races where gender determines armor [look.](https://look.It) It's been very difficult trying to find plain armoured leggings. Everything is a buttcape, or a skirt or a sideskirt. There are some ornate leggings and ornate armoured leggings. But no plain ones. I'm trying to make a relatively plain looking heavy armor sylvari female guardian and it's been a pain, at the moment I'm just wearing an outfit.
---
If your goal is fractals I'd wait a few days on gearing a rev since diviner should be a huge boost to the rev + firebrand combo. You could always aim for the ascended armor / weapons and [stat swap](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing) them into the harder to get gear too. But yes, gearing a power DPS class is by far the easy option and ascended armor only starts to matter as you get it higher tier.
---
&gt; Why did she get a call from the Dream, even though she wasn't chosen by the Egg?
---
Wait... I always thought Caithe was supposed to be Vlast champion, but she got too focused on trying to kill the elder dragon to ever think about it. After all Pale Tree will tell you that Player Character and Caithe are the only Sylvari to see vision of a dragon in their dream (if Player Character is a Sylvari) so it would be fitting if they were both supposed to be dragon champions and Caithe misinterpreted it initially as a vision to slay elder dragon... 
---
Of course I'm on the bus when I see this...
---
I just made mine yesterday too! Only took me 3 seasons though but I grinded like hell in the first two. T4 is a whole different beast compared to T1 - T3. I went from a terribad PvE Silver1 player to almost Gold3 doing the whole collection. 
---
If I could turn back time, I’ll quote another comment I read in reddit on The Ascension many months ago “fuck me for even starting” xD
---
It looks amazing and all but the Charrior main within me screams out "Who would ever run double sword on warrior?!"
---
I edited my response to include cheap berserker gear, the parts are 1.5-2g a piece so you can get them pretty fast even if you just do the daily. Wouldn't be a bad idea to have a cheap set already as you work towards the more expensive one. It might also take a few days after the release for people to figure out the best mixing of pieces and nail down the meta a little more. Anet has also been slow with adding the new stats to gear in the past so you might need to wait on that too (basically needs to be added to all stat selectable items and sometimes they forget)
---
Wait, I bought HoT AND PoF - I can have an extra character in the same world? :O  
---
I still have to make an ele D: .. or a necromancer.. hmm, or was  it a guardian ugh choices.
---
Maybe buy the living story episode needed to unlock silvewaste for farming possibilities. Then farm the gold, to buy the gems, to purchase the deluxe upgrade to lift restrictions from your account and then start working on the QoL things people have mentioned.
---
If your FTP with no plan to upgrade at all, maybe the world boss stone would be a good option too?
---
Beautiful reflections on the armour!  Looks amazing
---
You complain that there is not something new *every* time you log in, whilst giving out false information that it is *always* the same.
---
That either means that you failed to read what the guy above you wrote (defend temple happens only when conquering was successful etc.) or you are just happy to troll around.
---
&gt;She tried to kill her own former master
---
Not only her master, but biological father as well.
---
&gt; The player sees a vision Zhaitan, and then fights a nightmare of the Shadow of the Dragon
---
You mean in tutorial? It would mean that *Player Character* Wyld Hunt was to kill dragon (and which one? we succeeded twice), and yet Aurene have chosen us as her champion. I wouldn't mix gameplay and plot, considering there was Malyck in Sylvari personal story, and there was supposed to be a second Sylvari Tree in Maguuma Jungle, so even plot of personal story seems to be inconsistent with HoT story. We do not know what Caithe saw (except "she saw a dragon") and in that you are right. Is there something crucial I'm missing? 
---
First, those potions are extra progression for players who do higher tier fractals often. Their effects also make gathering AR over 150 have at least *some* use, so they also act as a slight infusion sink. 
---
Second, CMs should never made easier unless what's making them difficult is a bug or design flaw.

Third:

You can make a line break with two spaces at the end of a line.

Can anyone recommend a good PvE Reaper guide, either written or on YouTube? I just started playing as one and I'm a bit lost. I'm currently just running minions in every skill slot because they don't require much management, but I'm sure that's far from ideal. Thanks!
---
I would also add a NO vote, stating I hate PvP, I don't play PvP, and if you want to PvP then go do it in a "not PvE" map/area. And yes, in many other MMOs people chase you around flood you with dual/challenge requests and it is annoying as heck. You don't seem to understand that what is "fun" for you might not be fun for others. I have met many people that think "you play online so you can duel other live players", this is absolutely NOT true. Blocking? What happens with guild invites? You block them and they whisper you. Now I have to block the individual.  It is another version of spam calls to your cell phone. Fun aren't they?
---
I also played SWTOR and hated that it would switch you to PvP mode automatically, or when it would force you to PvP areas to complete a quest. The PvE player does NOT find this amusing, entertaining or fun. If the PvP area is empty, you need to figure out what the PvP players want, not force it onto PvE players.
---
Sorry, semi-rant off. Just sharing... :-)

Tab Target or Accept Target if target was called.

Spam Tab Target to cycle available enemies.

WASD is standard Movement buttons for me, and I hold down Right click to strafe with A and D.

If I wanna turn around quickly I either move my cursor fast or just hit mouse 3 to about face.

He is, but people are calling *my* character he/him/sir. That's the problem.
---
Metabattle has good builds for open world as well as some tips on how to use them. 
---
Class guides are generally not that common since majority of gw2 content is quite easy and solo friendly so you can experiment with lots of stuff and still be successful, which is why it's recommended to try as many things as possible while leveling. 
---
I have taken a liking to what you've done..
---
Could you make one of my asuran Golemancer Zaqq? [https://imgur.com/a/6FgXTWT](https://imgur.com/a/6FgXTWT)
---
I noticed the same thing. It was definitely not recognizing my character's gender properly.
---
I think what baltazar is doing is more of a problem :(
---
That is a bug. It must be on the new side as I did not run into it while playing through PoF as a female character.
---

Freaking [Alchemic Regression Dual-Utility Inter-Nodal Operators](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/SCRAP_80-T_Alchemic_Regression_Dual-Utility_Inter-Nodal_Operator), how do they work?
---
We have instanced raids in 10 man groups with almost 20 bosses.
---
How do I take advantage of this as someone from Singapore?
---
I’d highly recommend giving GW2 a shot yes - there’s TONS of end-game content like you describe. 
---
As for pet classes, check out Minion Master Reaper Necromancer - IMHO, it’s a wonderful class, with hard-hitting pets that performs admirably in everything from Open World solo story lines all the way to end-game Raid and Fractals content.  You *will* need to purchase the Heart of Thorns expansion to take max advantage of the Necro class via the Reaper Elite upgrade, but the non-Elite version is almost as good for Open World and still viable in other end-game stuff I found personally. (Feel free to send me a PM if you need tips or a build that I found effective while leveling up Reaper). 
---
Good luck and I hope to see you in-game! 
---
You may both be right depending on the amount of boons and infusions added in the equation. Don't be an asshat.
---
I'm not sure how they're packaged, but if you care about the story, you should play HoT before PoF to understand what the hell is going on, since their stories are consecutive (the events of HoT lead to PoF). If not, up to you which features you like more.
---
Or just be safe and get both! :P 
---
If you care about story, then HoT occurs first chronologically.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
If you want to excel at WvW/PvP/Endgame PvE then the choice will depend on which classes and roles you prefer, as you will want to choose the expansion that unlocks the best elite specialisation for you.
---
If you care about open-world or single player then PoF is simply better made than HoT but has very little replayability, making it perfect if you don't have a huge number of hours to dedicate to the game. HoT meanwhile focuses on huge map-wide metas that are designed to be played again and again, and has multiple collections and achievements that will require a lot of time to complete (though be aware that due to the age of the expansion there are a handful that may be effectively impossible).
---
It was teased on the episode 5 trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jx5yzWRBpiw
---
I quite like the Leystone armor as a light armor set, at least on human/sylvari females, and with a silvery or gold dye in the right channels, it has a nice metal armor look.
---
Would be a nice late Christmas gift!
---
Ah! I missed that part.
---
Still I think it's stupid, if you compare it with their current goal changes. I really do not expect any of DPS players to swap to diviner just because he is the only source of some useful boon. 
---
When out of combat, following commander, 'R' autorun with Rmouse/mouse turn. Combat Q/W/E strafe, fwd, strafe.  'S' rarely.  When casual walking, Lmouse+Rmouse, walk and turn.  Due to injuries, constant wasd is painful and awkward for me.
---
As a male human character player, I don't understand either. 
---
Someone's still salty about Ascalon :D
---
If you had to give me a number, how many different end-game PvE "instances" are there in the game?
---
I really think I'll give it a try soon, If I'll need help I'll contact you, thanks!
---
Yeah!  I'd love to see the charr Homelands.  Seeing the Ash Homelands would be SICK!
---
We never even got it with gliding!
---
go tell anet then and dont spam off topic in unrelated posts
---
If the only way you can have fun is spout racially charged memes then you are on the wrong website, maybe 4chan's /pol/ is more your style.
---
I liked double sword :(
---
Is there data on salvaging ectos
---
That is so well done I initially thought it was a figurine. 
---
Add me into the randomness! Thanks!
---
cool!
---
Warrior is technically dps class but often labeled as support only because it drops banners before every fight. It's mandatory in every pve group because of that.
---
Probably Matriarch Brass and Enameled Amenity?
---
About fractals, a lot of people call them "mini" dungeons. That is not wrong but in comparison with some other MMO, they are not always that "mini".
---
I remember some 5 man dungeons from WoW (like in MoP) where you finish the dungeon in 10-15 min with only the "required" gear. And that was called a full dungeon.
---
Fractals are a good chunk of content if you like instancied 5 man content.
---
Thanks, that's interesting, as they are they are the most expensive ones atm (I guess because of Winter's Presence and the meta-runes), this would be good for the average price.
---
&gt; This is also why all the Abaddon statues in GW2 kill people who dance near them.
---
they do?? have to try this out
---
Just wait for mystic forge recipe to get Salvage-it-all-matic.
---
And I think expressing my discontent as a player for this little marketing stunt - *runes and sigils rework + Runecrafter's Salvage back to back* - in light of the results showed in this research is relevant to the topic, so let's agree to disagree.
---
The thing is that base game has 5 character slots, while F2P version is limited down to 2. You then can get 1 more character slot with each expansion's deluxe version , and then you can buy more character slots for gems (and as an owner of expansion, you have the option to trade ingame gold for gems). 
---
I think that the most characters per account are something like...69? according to GW2efficiency. 
---
So yeah, you can have a lot of characters and play them differently or whatever you want.
---
&gt;And even if it was, it's an elite skill, CD too long to be present at all times ...
---
It is 45 secs CD.
---
I believe more raids have challenge motes than fractals (only 2 for fractals), but yes, challenge motes could probably be held up as distinct enough to be a whole nother encounter.
---
That's the usual way. Although, I did get a recipe for the Sigil of Air as a drop yesterday...but it seems to be the only way to acquire it. It costs about 6 times as more to craft a Superior Sigil than to buy one off the TP though.
---
...they really should have just left the Rune &amp; Sigil recipe unlocks to Discovery.
---
25 seperate dungeon paths.
---
18 different fractals (19 on Tuesday)
---
6 different raid wings. 
---
Vabbian Bronze is my guess for the gold.
---
Can't have it all, there aren't any Cathlu professions. Below are some of the professions with core and Elite specs that fit your bill. Isn't inclusive, there are variants for each profession - outside of brainless and don't die - but these are IMHO the best at each. 
---
&gt;dps aoe
---
Elem, Engi, Necro, Mesmer (thinking clones here)
---
&gt;dosent die quickly and isnt brainless 
---
Warrior, Guardian, Necro, Ranger, Engi
---
&gt;Condi and power viable.
---
Necro, Mesmer, Thief, Engi
---
&gt;Andfast attacks
---
Mesmer, Thief, Reverent, Guardian (core at least)

There were a few dev interviews and discussions about it:
---
* https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/hidden-arcana-designing-the-new-lions-arch/

* https://www.mmorpg.com/interviews/envisioning-the-new-hope-of-a-new-lions-arch-1000009809
---
The two main reasons they didn’t want to use ships again is b/c they’re flammable and packing them so tightly was a fire hazard, and was the main reason the whole city went up in flames during Scarlet’s attack on it.  They chose sea creatures b/c they wanted to keep it nautical but also provide easy to recognize landmarks for players to tell each other where stuff is in chat.
---
The first one I can understand, but the second seems unnecessary and more a part of the dumbing down of mmorpg’s.  People learn where stuff is one way or another, don’t need to spoon feed everything.
---
well, those are assassin's armor, as "medium" there are always the ranger ones to add
---
I don't see the post as an advertisement. I am thankful for the efforts put into this research. ;)
---
But I am also disappointed to see that the recent issues with motes droprate and ridiculously expensive new recipes following the runes and sigils rework was a mean to boost sales for a new Salvage-o-Matic that came out right after as well as a sale on shared inventory slot. *What a coincidence!* \*wink wink*
---
Yes, I'm the one with "the stupidest comment".
---
*Did you notice how soft Rytlock-chans fur is, senpai?* 
---
^(Im so sorry...)
---
I feel like the first one is dumb and the second one makes sense. Providing land marks isn't dumbing down. It's providing players with an effective way to communicate.
---
Sell them now. If you don't have a decent storage (xxxx stacks), it's unnecessary to storage them. Maybe your ROI will raise, but at all it's only a few silvers per day..
---
I would create a few different classes and play them up to level 20 or so. It doesn't take long and will give you a fairly good idea on their mechanics. Then just stick with the one that you like best. As you level up the rotations will become a bit more important but you can adapt in baby steps.   
---
oh boy, i miss my main look so much, i kept t3 medium on my "gw1 main ancestor" for so long and i'm just tired of it.. 
---
atm i'm using 4 pieces of legendary medium[didnt crafted helm and shoulders yet], it's almost worse, even if i like it when not in combat.
---
Are you okay there, man?
---
I have a huge struggle .. I have almost everything completed. Only need to win 10 games with a 3rd class .. problem is I only really enjoyed playing thief necro and tempest support. Tempest support now sucks and I can't play necro and thief cause I already won 10 games on both. SO yeah Im stuck here trying to learn a new class but every time I try I dislike it .. 
---
GJ on that :D Maybe I will infuriate some players and grind my way with low rank games with my shitty tempest build. 
---
I recommend PoF as well. HoT maps are pretty punishing compared to PoF, while you do miss out on the story and the lore, well it's 2019 vs 2014, so you'll be playing catch-up to a lot of stuff anyway. 
---
Plus you can always get HoT when it goes on sale some time later, and right now I believe there's a post here that said PoF is 50% off somewhere? Plus HoT maps are super easy to navigate if you have the mounts from PoF, so I definitely suggest getting PoF first for that Quality of Life improvement.
---
Learn the power Rifle build, it's better than the sword one
---
Hey everyone, so before I try out guild wars 2 I wanted to ask how this game is compared to FF14's endgame and dungeon content. In FF14 the endgame felt like I ran into a brick wall and they have this bs way of handing out 1 piece of armor per week (chest and pants take 3 weeks!) essentially. I hated this so much and was wondering if gw2 has a different approach to there endgame aspects of this game? Please be 100% honest because this is going to make or break playing this game for me if it is essentially the same.
---
TL;DR for the TLDR:
---
* Basic kit:
---
  * Non-ecto gear with no rune/sigil. 
---
* Runecrafter kit:
---
 * Non-ecto gear with rune/sigil.
---
* Rare kit: 
---
 * Ecto gear with cheap rune/sigils.
---
* Black lion kit; or upgrade extractor, then rare kit:
---
 * Ecto gear with expensive upgrades.
---
Non ecto gear:  Gear with no or low ecto chance: basic, fine, or masterwork quality at any level, or rare/exocit gear under lvl 68.
---
   
---
Ecto gear:  Gear with good ecto chance: Rare or exotic level 68 and higher.
---
I only started enjoying hots content after I finished POF. Without griffon and Springer you can't get anywhere "instinctively" in HoT.
---
Also mobs are a PITA there so bring your stunbreaker(s) and never take a hit on purpose because if you play glassy like me it's downed time.
---
I started to like VB and TD once I did a few metas, still don't dig AB much and don't have much playtime in DS.
---
What scarf is it?
---
I'm actually using the upgraded light one on my male Mesmer.  First time I've swapped his armor since 2014.  Not even kidding.
---
Saturday night is party time!!
---
Price peak is around Halloween
---
Hah, I was a bit out of the loop with that issue so I'll take your word for it. 
---
Shhhhh
---
I did the same thing with guardian. I'm so sorry to all those people who had to play with my shitty guardian XD
---
Good luck!! You can do it!
---
&gt; you only had to buy the latest Expansion in order to have full access to the game.
---
The core game (the thing we bought in 2012) is now free to play with some restrictions on chat and the trading post (to help stop bots). Buying any "expansion" removes those restrictions. The expansions are:
---
* GW2 Digital Deluxe edition (just the core game, but some free items and stuff)
---
* Heart of Thorns
---
* Path of Fire
---
In addition, there are Living World seasons. Each season is multiple chapters. When a chapter goes live, it's free and it considered "current" for several months. As long as you log in at least once while the chapter is "current", it gets automatically added to your account for free and then you have access to it forever on any character (even characters you make later). Once the next chapter goes live, the old one is no longer "current". If you already have the old one, nothing changes for you. If you *did not* log in while the old chapter was "current", then you have to pay 200g for permanent access to that chapter. If you buy multiple chapters at the same time, like buying an entire season, you get a discount. The game will not let you pay for a chapter you already own, so you can't screw it up. If you own 2 chapters in season 2 and you but the "Full Season 2" pack, you'll only be charged for the chapters you didn't already own.
---
The order of the story is:
---
* Core GW2 Personal Story
---
* Living World Season 1: Scarlet's War
---
* Living World Season 2
---
* Heart of Thorns story
---
* Living World Season 3
---
* Path of Fire story
---
* Living World Season 4 (ch4 is current, ch5 comes out next week)
---
All of that can be replayed as many times as you like on any characters *except* Living World Season 1: Scarlet's War. That was a one-time, live event that unfortunately can't be replayed. However, if you want to learn/relearn what happened in the storyline, you can talk to Ela Makkay in Lion's Arch for a recep or you can [watch the Living World Season 1 movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d17gwV4vXOg).
---
Hey, it's me your brother.
---
I don’t agree with the OPs post, but saying his reaction time is shot is BS. Seriously, are you still a teenager or something? 
---
Twenty five years isn’t long, the fact that he mentioned it insinuates the guy is probably in his late 20s, which would not affect reaction time. Unless the guy didn’t start playing games until his 30s, I don’t see how you can assume poor reaction time based on 25 years of gaming. Hell, I’ve been playing games for ~29 years (and I’m only 32). 
---
The only **item** aspect in regards to end-game is crafting legendary's. GW2 is based around achievements mostly so you have to be really into that to make the end game enjoyable. And well some of them are grueling and only come with a few rewards. Maybe a title, an item needed for making a legendary or just "points" in general. For my wife and I we mostly enjoy that, working weeks if not months on a quest line to have a shiny weapon is disturbingly fun (lol). 
---
Yes.
---
GW2 utilizes a "megaserver" architecture. It does a great job of keeping zones populated. 
---
Thanks for the effort in your post : ) I guess I will give the game a shot after all.
---
Played the last story step epilogue of PoF and noticed that too. Also one more thing, I think it failed to recognize my race.  
---
On wiki it says:
---
**Canach:** Which means I'm stuck in this haven for giddy, singing, dancing humans for at least one more day.
---
**If sylvari:** **Canach:** Heat and humans is not my idea of a good time. 
---
**Otherwise:** **Canach:** We sylvari are not, by and large, a "giddy" folk. 
---
I got the **otherwise** option even tho I'm a female sylvary. There's also a chance that the wiki is wrong.  
---
If you want to play the TP I'd advise to use only part of your liquid gold (like 100g in your case) and be prepared to lose (some of) it if your plans don't work out. Depending on your mentality you can prepare and invest in research (r/gw2economy is a good starting point for guides, q&amp;a etc.) or just jump in and learn by trial and error (lots and lots of error :P).
---
Tips I personally found the most useful: 1) Diversify, 2) Run test samples
---
haha yea I just don't wana play DE I don't like the spec and I don't like what its about... I want someone to look into my eyes when I down them. LOL jk jk but i understand i was hoping core, or daredevil got at least balanced not take a hit from lead attacks

Why is pistol shield better than hammer for scrapper support ?
---
The kind that likes to [deflect bullets back to their sender](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shield_Master) using [a sword](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Riposte).
---
Here's my take on this: it's been made to counter the charm flippers, and it's on the BLTC so that Anet can make some quick gold from it. 
---
So I want to know if this will be better than any of the existing salvage kits when Charms are dirt cheap?
---
Druid is better due to the multitude of offensive buffs that Druid can provide. Scourge does well in fractals, for multiple reasons:
---
1. Barrier strength isn't impacted by agony like healing is. A lot of mechanics that inflict agony can be safely tanked with good barrier application.
---
2. Boon hate on specific fractals/instabilities. Well of Corruption is a popular choice (especially if you're traited for improved wells), but you can easily take a scourge utility as well if the fight is more mobile.
---
3. Very good breakbar damage.
---
4. Decent support outside of barrier. Might uptime isn't to the level of Druid, but with BiP and traits, you can hover around 20 might stacks pretty easily. Res support is what Scourge is extremely good at, but you can forgo res traits for slightly more healing/dps and for more well uptime (with more prot uptime as a result). 
---
Assuming you have a Power DPS chrono and a Soulbeast that takes spirits, you could work around having a druid in fractals and have a fairly smooth run with support scourge. 
---
thief is the easiest and meta right now, kinda brainless .
---
but for variety there is Guardian who can be support , dps and condi and easier than engi 
---
the main faucet for charms and symbols from unid gear is identified green gear, since identified blue gear doesnt have runes and sigils slotted, just like the sets of awakened and elonian rares, which make up a good portion of the rare loot table.
---
So a low MF sample of green unids (or high MF sample of blue unids) will yield you more charms and symbols than rare unids at any MF rate.
---
Why?!
---
It's not a crutch I got my omni doing T4+recs every day. I still do T4s + recs every day because I like fractals (slowly buying the account upgrades but even though I have all the required relics I'd rather spend my gold in cosmetics).
---
Btw I run fractals since before the pots existed and 50 was top level.
---
Or they could make strafe default instead since new players always feels that the movements are clunky and weird, and they are. To remove that feeling for new players would be worth more imo.
---
Man, remember secondary professions in gw1? So miss that game.
---
Oh great news I love achievements in mmorpgs!!!
---
I've never noticed that happening to me, so I suppose it must either be a bug or an oversight. 
---
Just be prepared to wiki a lot of things.
---
As someone completely new to engi, how hard would it be to hop straight in and learn the power rifle kit build?
---
Played power chrono/power DH mainly so far.
---
Depends. If we're looking at the options, it's most likely that a class currently running Marauder gear, but which doesn't need the added vitality, will benefit most from trimming that in favor of Diviner. It still means a loss of precision though, so optimization math will apply for crit chance overall.
---
The other option is in comparing to Harrier, if a given piece of that stat can be trimmed from a build for heal power alone.
---
10% boon duration from runes equates to about 150 concentration, so on purely stat-value math (which is difficult), runes that add a flat boon duration on top of offensive stats likely win out. Unfortunately, there's no general rune with both power and boon duration, unless you look at specific boons like Might on Rune of Strength.
---
Honestly, I can't see a high end application for it in PvE, unless it ends up being comp-changing for some reason. In WvW at least, I'm looking forward to playing gear tetris to see how much I can/need to fit into a herald build.
---
The question is, if all rarities have the same distribution of sigils and runes. If not, magic find might have an influence.
---
Even though the game is over 6 years old you will find tons of players even in starting areas. GW2 use megaservers in PvE which means all people in the same region (EU or NA) play together. 
---
Except for in World verses World then server matters. If you are the pvp type of guy make sure to make a good server choice when you start. 
---
It's FREE. Go play it and find out if you like it.
---
I like playing healing tempest elementalist and it's still viable in any mode for second healer role. Keep that in your mind.
---
I don't think a lot of bots are in plat 3 so that probably explains why, i guess bots and afk are more common in gold.
---
I have had a very similar issue a few times, often after an ingame update. Clearing the hidden/temp GW2cache folder fixed the issues I had, dunno why, but there we are :-) .

From the thumbnail I came here thinking Tybalt might finally have somebody to share his apple cider with.

Ahh, that hit the spot.

What? Why what's the big deal? You don't want a better CPU?

I’m not blaming, it’s indeed very stupid. Got f’d myself quite a few times before I learned

Tybalt, about that apple cider
---
Ah don't worry about it. I'm sure we will get to share the cider one day.

HoT does not include PoF. maybe there's a bundle with the two of them, but neither one includes the other
---
Is Metabattle up to date with WvW builds? Or is there any other good source for meta builds for wvw out there.
---
-&gt; It wasn't used in military context, it was just a random commoner NPC talking to my character
---
-&gt; So far they've seemed to get everything right so far, which is why it was weird
---
Yes
---
I think the question was about salvaging ectos with the Runecrafter's, but I'm not sure.
---
Agrees completely with my experiences as well. Retaliation uptime being spotty really lowers the realistic damage for dh in less skilled groups for sure. And the rotation for dh is tighter with neat burst windows with stacki g your multipliers that a lot of newer players dont do well in my experience.

You're forgetting rune of the pack, which gives both power and boon duration.

I play in t2-t3 atm (Minstrel hard to get) but I can pretty easily tank/heal most fractals on firebrand with ministrels/magis.

If that is true than look no further. lol

Did you really start gaming at 3? Ok, sure whatever. Do you remember anything worthwhile or useful before 10? Not just about gaming, but in general? Probably not, most people don't carry much in terms of their memories from before 10. You forget most of it. 
---
But let's say for the sake of argument that you started gaming in a competitive setting at the age of 12 and got any good at it by 15, 25 years later and you're 40, right when reaction time starts falling off considerably.
---
I love the weapon -&gt; skills system too. It means skill balancing can be tackled per weapon, where if a given weapon is too loaded or too strong for a single class, then they can tune it down a bit for that single weapon without impacting the class as a whole.
---
(*Do note, the following is an example of a possible combination and I am not advocating for nerfs*). So like, if they ever decide Greatsword is too good on Soulbeast, but Sword/Axe is fine, then only Greatsword and only on Soulbeast gets adjusted. If players are upset that the weapon skillset was tuned down a bit, they can at least rest-assured that the class itself is still the same, and/or Greatsword wasn't affected on any other class.
---
In most other titles I've played, either the class itself gets hit, or the weapon (for all classes) gets hit. Having the given weapon on a single class hit, but all other weapons untouched and the base class unchanged stings a lot less.
---
I also recognize they've nerfed classes directly when necessary, but it feels like they try to go for specific weapon skillsets first if they are part of the "too good" equation before hitting the class itself, and that, to me, feels much fairer than in other titles where they HAVE to hit the class directly, otherwise hitting the weapon affects ALL OTHER classes too.

No, Daredevil doesn't pull ahead on either Qadim or Conjured Amalgamate to an extent that compares with 40k+ from Mirages on Soulless Horror. However, I already addressed in my other comment in this thread that I think Daredevil is overtuned but I'm glad you are backing up my original point that Wing 6 is designed terribly. It's about playing the character select screen more than the fights.

This game has some pretty awesome maps and I've always thought it was a shame we can't pvp in any sort of way in them.

Interesting snippet. Actually now I wonder if that For loop could be a lagger because of that trigger

I mean I get that if you only play pvp it's frustrating if all you see are the posts about bots/multis set up to rig the wins and shit, but lul ded gaem doesn't really carry much weight
---
wvw has been an afterthought in regards to updates for a while too, but still pretty active. pve stuff is still really active and it's not really hard to argue that's the core focus of development for this game.
---
either way, being worried about downvotes is silly. post what you want to say and that's that. there's some very dedicated individual (or bot or something) that insta downvotes basically every post ever on this sub so if you're new here I guess it can be a big spoopy thing

Idk, I played Aion for a full year on and off, and while that game was absolutely the eye-candy MMO of the time for me (after playing Rift for a bit, which was WoW made pretty), and I still found GW2 to be FAR beyond Aion beautiful.  I remember reading every Anet dev blog post prior to GW2's release.  The one that showcased the costume designs blew me away.  
---
I also wasn't crazy about Tera's style.  I've never played B&amp;S though, but I've seen crazy customizations come out of that.  
---
*but I chose my character's gender... has she escaped my control?*
---
Sigh. Might be worth a try. I think they're mostly running T4's though. Hmm. Maybe time to grind for more ascended accessories or ectoplasm to upgrade mine. Sigh. 
---
I've had some great experiences in T2's and sometimes going down to T1's to help newbies start out was super fun but my two days in T3 has been really disheartening. Wiping once because three little darlings decided to set themselves on fire and we had to /gg doesn't mean the whole thing is doomed.  
---
I actually didn't notice that there was an 6 wins in one day achievement o.o . I rushed very hard, I did T1-4 (except the 19 wins left) in this season.
---
My (current?) PvP main is Reaper, I like the high hp bar + shroud and the aoe blinds. 
---
For achievement I played Ranger, Warrior and Thief. Ranger was my first main PvP char, but that's 4-5 seasons ago, so my old build didn't work anymore and I was really bad at the on I found at metabattle. 
---
With Thief I tried a few build (played it only PvE before) and failed hard. Then I found phew phew Deadeye, I wasn't much better than before, but atleast it was fun to play. :D
---
And Warrior (actually Spellbreaker)... I never player Warrior and had absolutely no idea of anything. It was pretty fun to play but also here, I was really bad and got manny insults because of that. But all in all I learned much about Warriors there and I can use it now when I play Reaper. :D
---
And also it was pretty fun, when all achievements were done, to play Reaper again and go into silver 2/3 matches. Felt a bit like "yeah, I'm so good". :D
---
This is a fantastic idea - I almost forgot that I also have a spare code, so looks like there'll be two winners today :)
---
Thank you, it’s a great combo!
---
What am I missing? and how old are you? 
---
You realize that PvP focused marketing almost ruined this game completely right? I love GW2 PvP, but you're truly delusional. This game has always been funded by and kept afloat because of PvEers. They have no need nor will to focus on PvP again.
---
It's why we keep getting player-made "PvP initiative" resurages every 3 months. Caspian was the driving force of many of the PvP comeback movements uer even he has almost totally stopped trying.
---
My friends and I basically considered that Caithe was being subtly manipulated by Mordremoth to bring the egg closer to him in the form of a so called new hunt. Considering the story strongly imply hinting Caithe had no business taking Aurene's egg. Just our headcanon.

Make a mystic salvage kit
---
4 pieces of equipment/universal upgrades/sigils/runes of the same rarity can be put into the mystic forge - you have a 80% chance of receiving back a random item of the same type and same rarity, and a 20% chance of receiving a random item of the same type and upgraded rarity.   If you want to buy something off of the TP, there are weapons available for 30 copper each you could toss in.  Or you can adventure around a bit when you see it's a daily, and save a few items to throw in instead of salvage. 
---
Get four weapons for karma from a lower level zone and chuck them in. They have to be the same quality. Get a cheap dagger, sword, mace and axe or something. 
---
But don't they also gut down support classes in each balance patch, and say they do not want to create a class roles? Like currently no class can provide big variety of boons. 
---
Looks correct, yes and it also looks the same for many other gem-shop items. Maybe I should have added such a calculation to the main sheet.
---
the fact that you just explained to ME all that ^ confirms it yes.
---
Also, if you really want ALL your current settings to be saved, check out the "**%appdata%/Roaming/Guild Wars 2**" folder for the GFXSettings .xml file.

---
I kind of got that impression. You can brute-force it up to a point and you might not even know there *are* mechanics of you've got experienced (or just observant) players who do them quietly when you're not looking. Like that grawl shaman you've got to throw rocks at to break his shield - I've seen people genuinely ignore it and just take down the adds because dps is gud. Did you know that he kills you all if it takes too long because only one of you is throwing the rocks? I didn't until recently. 
---
First time playing? Fine, you didn't know. T2? You really should be paying attention. 
---
Go ahead, it is meant to be something you look back at since it have so much info and impossible to remember it all at once :)
---
Sorry, why do you say Yu instead of you?
---
lmao, the whole personal anecdotal evidence bit that uses examples of extreme outliers to prove your point. Sure there are a few people you can find that can play competitively in their later years, but that's not gonna be the norm. Those are literally the outliers and shouldn't be used as an example. That's like saying "The average life expectancy *isn't* 78 in the US because my grandmother made it to 102" ummmm, okay? Doesn't prove anything.
---
as for the "I love pvp" suuure. Wouldn't it still raise some eyebrows if I told people I seriously wanna kill my wife, I still love her though by the way don't worry haha.

This will depend on several factors. Namely,
---
* If you have space to store them for an entire year, the per-unit price peaks around Halloween and the next Wintersday.
---
* However, you will only see marked difference in profits if you have sufficiently larger quantities of boxes.
---
* For example, the difference of selling a single 250-stack at 5s versus 7s is 4.25g post-taxes. Considering that, for example, it will take six months for the price to return to that 7s threshold, that's a 2.36s profit per day.
---
* So while you can gain a fair bit of coin with large enough quantities of boxes, you'll either be investing a lot of bank or bag space to store the boxes, or a fair amount of gold in listing fees (1.75 gold per stack, using the 7s example above).
---
Build templates.
---
The best profession to use for comanding is the Guardian and the elite spec Firebrand. 
---
This number still varies a lot; say, it can go down if one bought gems at a lower rate earlier, or if the rumours of legendary sigils/runes turn out true and the demand for components increase even more.
---
Oh man, it basically told me that I shouldn't be playing a thief. lol
---
Hey man that's real nice of you to say, but I certainly don't do any more than any of the other awesome content creators this game has. This is Jaw's tournament, I just made the reddit post :D I'm always happy to help support this communities initiatives, especially ones that I find enjoyable to take part in :)

Thank you. I don't know anets plans, but i guess the goal was to higher the supply of the materials for runes and sigils without making the two other Salvage-o-Matics obsolete. If they made this one better than the other both for every rarity, they would only sell one, now peoble may still buy two or all three differnt kits.

Yes. Even GW 1 still going on -)

Having played through Living World Season 3 and 4 this past week, the last episode of LWS3 is very broken in this regard. More jarring, though, was one of the NPCs in particular referring to me as non-human, even when my character is human.  To top it off, said NPC had met me before during the level 20 personal story quest (where I find out about my character's missing parents).
---
Being vague as to avoid spoilers. :o
---
No add-ons that I'm aware of, but there is an interface size option in display settings.
---
5 Living World episodes (the regular 4 + the next one that was supposed to release this year) with satisfying story (yes: LS4 episodes 1, 3, 4; no: LS3 episodes 3, 5, 6).
---
It makes a decent farming build that's for sure. Generally for engies, you want to throw in some kits like bomb kit, because as is, staying on rifle isn't the best damage ever.
---
But other than that, it's fine for now. If you're more curious about specifics, metabattle has some general guides and builds, and for raids and fractals, snowcrows and discretize are generally where people tend to look
---
Short Answer: No. 
---
Long Answer: Not really. There was was a renegade commander build floating around a while ago that I saw a few drivers running but I don't really know much about what it was, possibly a twist on the raid support build. It doesn't sound like you're very experienced when it comes to WvW or the game in general, which is fine don't get me wrong, but stepping into a commander role without the necessary knowledge can be tough. It also depends on what you plan on commanding. If you're just going to pop your tag and pugmand some PPT then it really doesn't matter what you run. If you plan on running an organized group on comms though you will want to stick to the meta and run Fireband (or Chrono). 
---
Contacts system overhaul.
---
Damn, I'm late, Ho is the new expansion? The mounts look amazing, and the new elementalist spec looks like so much fun. 
---
If some of you want more Pics from the Photoshoot i can post a collection later
---
First, a disclaimer: if you're looking for a game focused on end-game group PvE content, GW2 probably isn't going to be a great fit; it has some, but not an enormous amount, and it isn't really the focus of the game's ongoing development at this point. You'd probably have much more fun with Final Fantasy XIV, which is much more centered around Raids and the like. The subscription fee is a pain, as is the relatively high price point of getting all the expansions, but if you can deal with that it's definitely one of the best MMOs on the market right now, and you can play the trial version up to level 30 - enough to at least unlock and get a loose feel for all the classes and jobs in the core game.
---
That aside, leveling is (as are many things) somewhat different from most MMOs in GW2, as in many ways getting to the max level is only the beginning. This is largely due to the developers deciding that they weren't going to increase the level cap with expansions, so once you get to 80 there's still a quite substantial amount of game ahead, with more of a focus on horizontal progression over the usual grind for new levels and gear. Group structure in late-game PvE is kind of unorthodox as well; the game doesn't have dedicated class roles, so the usual trinity of Healer-Tank-DPS doesn't really exist in a conventional sense. Instead, compositions are more focused around maintaining uptime of Boons (generic buffs that most classes can apply, some better than others) and keeping everyone alive while putting out as much damage as possible, usually leading to a sort of four-Support, six-DPS affair.
---
The catch is that pretty much every class can fill either role in some way or other, often more than one way, so there's a considerable amount of flexibility in what your squad will end up looking like. While this level of customisation is nice, there are downsides as well: it's basically impossible to have any sort of automatic matchmaking, so finding a group is entirely dependent on LFG posts, and the game can't really teach players how to fill a given role over the course of leveling (nor would it want to, as this sort of content isn't the main focus of the game). You'll also find a pretty strict meta when looking for guidance on the internet, although in practice it probably has a lot more give to it than most would be willing to admit. Tanking isn't really a thing, beyond whoever happens to have aggro making sure the boss is in the right place, and the game tends to favor active defenses like dodging over passive so high-durability builds tend to be passed over in favor of more damage.
---
As for class options, Ranger and Necromancer are the two you'd probably enjoy most if summoning and pets are your thing, although late-game builds generally don't focus particularly heavily on those aspects of the classes due to other options being stronger or more reliable. Rangers always have an active pet fighting alongside them (unless they're using the Soulbeast Elite Specialization, which is a subclass of sorts) which takes up a fair chunk of their power budget, and a lot of their skills interact with said pet, whereas Necromancers have a skill set that focuses on summoning undead Minions to attack your enemies but it isn't as core to the class, which has a more broad theme of manipulating Life Force to take advantage of a powerful state called Death Shroud. For both classes, playstyles that focus on those aspects are perfectly viable for the more casual content that makes up the bulk of the game, but they tend to fall short in Raids and the like for various reasons. Several other classes have "summons" of sorts, like the Illusions that make up many of the Mesmer's mechanics or the Engineer's Turrets, but those are generally less pets and more skill mechanics.
---
Well, that should about cover what you're wondering about, sorry for being a bit long-winded. Feel free to drop me a line if there's anything else you're curious about.
---
Says the same about ranger. Doesn't even show a build. I've been using the sic em roamer build from metabattle though and having success and most importantly fun. No one's complained about me joining the Zerg every now and then either. Vabbi seems pretty elitist IMO.

What about all the professional fighting game players?

Infiltration started playing with SFIV and he is 33 today.

This "You can't be competitive after X age" is just a way of people excusing themselves for lack of hardwork. They need something to blame why they're bad.
---
I myself started PvP in Bronze and now I'm Low Plat. I commited myself to learn the game. Age has little to do with it as long as you're not 80.
---
Realistically though, T4 PUGs tend to be substantially better than T3 PUGs, so once you can get through T3, the frequency that you want to smash your face into the keyboard goes down dramatically.
---
As someone else suggested, try asking guildies if you can join them for dailies. You can completely bypass the T3 struggle and jump straight into T4, where hopefully people know what they are doing 
---
Actually they're probably both hot, unless the electrical current from bolt or the flames from incinerator turn themselves off.

\- If you have LS3-LS4 you can convert that Unbound Magic / Volatile Magic into Obsidian Shards.
---
\- Globbies, just salvage Rare/Exo
---
\-Mystic Clovers, PvP/WvW Rewards Tracks are a good way, otherwise Chest of Legendary Rewards, Fractal Exchange, otherwise pure Gamble (Mystic Forging might give you some T6 Mats as well) (why we recommending going for the mystic clovies first.
---
\-Icy Runestone there is no escape, it is a 100g sink.
---
\- For the Ingots, either TP or Farm Home Instance for a while.

\- Cured Leather Squares head to Lake Doric (LS3E4) if people still running it.
---
\- Onyx Lodestone, you either can wait to drop them all, or Mystic Forge them.

Which FB build are you playing when you’re solo queueing? Support may not be the best choice by yourself
---
That looks like an animation bugged by Dragon Hunter skill F2. That happens more often.
---
&gt; I don't know, you seem to know all about it though. Perhaps you could bring up some stats that'd prove your point?
---
You are the one claiming you can't be competitive past certain age. I don't have to prove anything to you. The facts are there. 
---
&gt;Nope, you're just back at using a singular example as your point.
---
A SINGULAR example? How old do you think most Esports professionals are these days? 15?
---
&gt;If you're insinuating that I'm using this excuse because I'm bad then whatever It's just that when most people's reaction time starts to fall off they realize they'll have to make up for it in other areas (just like you said). But then they realize they don't have the time or willpower anymore especially after losing something that came naturally. It may not be the sole reason, but it sure can me a major catalyst (and thus a valid excuse).
---
It's funny that you use your "hard earned plat" picture and then post:
---
&gt;Congrats, it's an easy if not tedious climb. And anyone can sure do it, they just need not make the multitude of shaky excuses.
---
You're just fighting with me cause you like to argue with people. You don't actually care about the things I say nor you're willing to change your point of view.
---
It's ridiculous really. Keep giving excuses to yourself why you can't do X or Y while others keep improving themselves. I'm sure your age is holding you back.
---
Loser.
---
This is reminding me of the big 'ol wolf in The Neverending Story, Gmork!
---
It's truly incredible! 
---
I've played the game pretty well on an older, slightly worse CPU (i3-550), and yours has a similar single-thread performance. I don't know about the graphics, but your laptop CPU might do alright. WvW is reasonably playable, just don't expect to run the game higher than medium graphics.
---
Chronos don't need 1400 concentration to maintain permanent boons any more, you need very little concentration. Snowcrows recommends +105 total (including food) for Insp/Duelling, not including runes. 
---
I don't think Chronos will be running a full set of Diviner's at all and it's very likely they won't run any at all.
---
I don't know about other classes.
---
Fists as weapon spec. Monk/Brawler style.
---
&gt; When used in a military context, "Sir" is not gendered.
---
That seems to stem (nearly?) exclusively from TV.  
---
for example reference the US Army Field Manual [7-21.13](https://usacac.army.mil/sites/default/files/misc/doctrine/CDG/cdg_resources/manuals/fm/fm7_21x13.pdf)  
---
&gt; For example, we train soldiers to say sir or ma’am when Talking to a higher ranking officer.
---
I at least haven't heard of a single high ranking female officer that is adressed with sir, let alone a military in which that is the case.
---
Judging by the number of upvotes and comments, yes. This is a controversial topic. 
---
&gt;Oh so its ok for gw2 to be toxic because other games are too? dude please.
---
That was *not* my point. Read what I wrote again, and try to understand this time. I'm not *saying* it's okay, of course it's not okay. I'm saying that *either way* you shouldn't let it get to you, just block/report and move on. You've seen it before, it's up to you on how to react to it. You can even get to the point one day, if you'll believe this, where it doesn't affect you anymore cause you're an adult and they're just kids being toxic in a video game. 
---
&gt;you dont get to tell me how many games there are afk. i was there. youre not. just stop.

Of course I don't know, that's why I brought up *my* experiences. So you have something to compare it too. Afks are made out to be this regular experience, that supposedly happen in 100% of everybody's games. Sorry if I don't readily and unquestioningly believe that. I even admit that they do happen. But how many times is it because they're down 250+ points? Probably in most cases, wouldn't you think? 
---
&gt;bots are prominient in plat games. there are statistics for that. just STOP.
---
The statistics I saw and the ones that were linked in this thread show them in silver. If you're still losing to bots in plat, that's your problem. There's a point that they can't reach because players using their brains can outsmart them, just get to that level. Use your brain.
---
&gt;what rank are you again?
---
As of now? [1613](https://i.imgur.com/du2vtjM.png) . What rank are you?
---
Gotta disagree. Cultural armor should remain race-locked.
---
What armor is that? I really liked it!
---
That's a hefty assumption.
---
Like people didn't know. 
---
Piss off.
---
Dragon mount, especially if there’s a skin that makes it a green fire or poison dragon
---
We'll remember you. Not as you are, but as you were.
---
The current white feather wings are too limp
---
Got it. So the order should be: Gamble for Mystic Clovers (and do WvW because I do that a bit), farm maps (my home instance has no stuff) and Lake Doric, then buy Stones/Lodestones. Is SW or Istan better?
---
J OMEGALUL W
---
They are both really good in competitive pvp right now (soulbeast and herald), those builds also work great for roaming. For pve power soulbeast will perform much better than power herald in instances (fractals/raids), for open world both work fine. 
---
Go Rev if you prefer Power over Condi. I would have said Soulbeast, but you shot that down instantly.
---
I run Assassin/Dwarf stance, Sword/Axe and Hammer equips, mix of Marauder and Berserker gear, with Devastation, Retribution, and Herald Specializations. I run Bloodlust Sigils on every weapon as an unbreakable rule, though, for this build.
---
I focus on Lifesteal for sustain (which works phenomenally as long as I don't get Blinded tbh), but my out-of-combat mobility is rather lacking. In 1v1's in WvW, unless the enemy is a Mirage, I typically can either come out on top or send them scurrying (in which case, my brand of mobility is perfect for chase anyway). I tend to take out any NPC guards in seconds, Pack Dolyaks only slightly less fast. Enemy Sentries are, once again, fast to take out. **You cannot 1v3+ in this build, they will undeniably outdamage your lifesteal and you may only take 1-2 out before going down yourself**
---
I tend to also roam, though I try to do so with the help of my bf's Reaper as the two synergize criminally well. When I'm running with his Reaper, we can usually take on groups in 2v5 with little trouble, unless multiple Mirages are present.
---
If you were more open to it, Condi Soulbeast is a lot of fun. I refer to it as the "more realistic Barbarian/martial master" (depending on weapon choice) as it isn't as flashy, but you feel like your blows are solid on impact, *and* that the bleed and poison you inflict pops your foe shortly thereafter.
---
Seems youre not watching twitch often, like when teapot did have his ERP tournament he did have alone +5k veiwers, also twitch dont determine if an game is big or if its get know by many ppl
---
Don't think ur ready to command bud
---
Guardian but guardian is braindead so i would pick engineer/holosmith
---
gw's pvp was actually good.
---
Seems youre not watching twitch often, like when teapot did have his ERP tournament he did have alone +5k veiwers on the GW2 category, also twitch dont determine if an game is big or if its get know by many ppl
---
I see you had asked a similar question over on /r/blackdesertonline. I've played both pretty extensively and still maintain a popular BDO fansite so I feel I can answer some of your questions for both games a little:
---
&gt; Lately I've also bought Black Desert Online (BDO) but the fact that's it's "kinda" single player is bothering me quite a bit.
---
**BDO** players will tell you that the game has non-solo grind spots/activities such as Savage Rift, but the truth is that the majority of your time in BDO will be either solo grinding mobs for XP+cash, or solo grinding lifeskills for cash+materials (materials being used to upgrade your gear). The gameplay loop in BDO is Grind→Upgrade Gear→Repeat (grinding is just working your way through a rotation of trash mobs). If you're one of the people who find single-player grind enjoyable, then you'll probably sink into it. If you are looking for an MMO which encourages players to group up, BDO is not it.
---
**BDO** is heavily carried by the fact that combat (mostly against PvE trash mobs) is fun and the game has a good-looking engine. If you enjoy sandbox-style PvP, guild-vs-guild drama, organised medium-scale fights, **and** you are willing to invest at least ~$30/mo to buy progress to stay competitive, then BDO has a better scene than GW2. Combat in GW2 has more complexity but isn't as smooth.
---
&gt; I'm looking for a game which has end-game content such as group PvE (possibly with instances), raids and bosses to kill in a group of specialized people.
---
**GW2** has 10-man instanced raids (active), 5-man instanced dungeons (kinda dead), 5-man instanced 'fractal' dungeons (active at the high end), 60-80-person non-instanced world meta events (massively active). Raids and Fractals require some specialised roles. PvP in GW2 is separated out to 80v80v80 World vs World instances, and 5v5 sPvP instances.
---
**BDO** has a single 5-man semi-instanced dungeon "Valtarra" (dead content), a 10-man instanced defence dungeon "Savage Rift" (kinda dead), and a couple of group grinding spots that you probably won't visit too often. PvP in BDO is open-world, with structured Guild vs Guild fights once per day, and some instanced PvP areas for practice.
---
&gt; I've played Tera quite a bit but looking for a group there is a pain, even if you're a tank or healer, so I've stopped playing it. Is Guild Wars 2 what I'm looking for?
---
I would recommend GW2 over BDO for you. GW2 is more similar to TERA, and group content with active scenes for both organized and ad-hoc groups of players. Get the demo, pick a class you like the look of, level it up to 80 via exploration/story(will take a week or two), but along the way try and visit some world bosses (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_boss) and get in an active helpful guild.
---
**GW2** does benefit from owning the two expansions, and a small amount of additional cash-shop expenditure is recommended for a a bit more bag space/bank space (although it is possible to grind for those). For Guild Wars 2 I would recommend $80 in your first few months, with no ongoing budget.  
---
**BDO** is not Free-to-play friendly, and I would recommend a budget of around $100 for BDO in the first couple of months for semi-required upgrades, with a minimum of ~$20/month after that if you wanted to stay PvP-competitive.
---
&gt; I've read guides and saw some videos of different games but they often lack information about the "typical journey" of a max level character.
---
Other people have typed up descriptions of average days in GW2, so I'll just do a quick comparison.
---
**GW2**: Log in. Do some daily crafting, do your daily achievements. Go to a world meta event/world boss with a couple of friends and group with 60 other players to defeat a boss (with the rewards going towards funding new gear or new armor/weapon skins from the market), repeat until friends/guild are ready to do Fractals, spend an hour running challenging Fractal instances, spend an hour exploring a new map and completing achievements to unlock new armor/weapon skins.
---
**BDO**: Log in. Do the daily event fetch quests. Run to a grind spot and if its free then grind for a couple of hours. Go to a world boss if you still need that boss' weapon. Grind for a few more hours. Chop trees for 30 minutes or so.
---
&gt; Last but not least, is there any class that does damage through summoned Foes/Pets?
---
**GW2**: Mesmer has clones/phantasms. Necro has a fairly popular pet/minion build. Ranger has a pet as part of it's primary class mechanic. Engineers have turrets/gryos but they're not always great.  
---
**BDO**: Tamer has a wolf which you can command, similar to a ranger in GW2. Witch/Wizard have summons but you're still mostly an AoE bot.
---
Nearly all armor not just medium in this game is ugly bugly neckbeard loser crap but there are some diamonds in the rough and yearly fock shitty outfits just ez lazy cashgrab
---
Make pvp great again
---
Okay, does the runecrafters get you a 100% drop of charms/symbols? The drop rate on those are terrible with other kits.
---
Not all medium armor pieces are ugly!
---
&gt;picks something that's not exclusively medium
---
Dragonhunter in raids or fractals with Quickness &amp; Alacrity is probably one of the smoothest rotations in the game in my opinion, but I've mained guardian since beta. Even without boons, I don't find DH or Greatsword clunky. Spear, Procession, and GS4 for Retaliation followed by GS2 for burst is very straight-forward and, when compared to actually-clunky and non-cohesive weapon rotations like Scrapper hammer for example, I really can't relate to you feeling that DH is at all clunky.
---
Personally, I find the Holo's need to pre-heat, their photon forge rotation in general, and their somewhat self-centric capabilities to be a lot less appealing for long term play.
---
it is the Heavy Requiem Armor set they added with the Jahai Bluffs. The Wings are a Bug from one of the Dragonhunters skills :)
---
Updated engine!
---
Minus being out of order chronologically, I find HoT areas greatly enhanced since obtaining mounts from PoF.  Sure, some may call it easy mode now, but the mounts won't help with some of the more annoying mobs in HoT areas (or those damned minigames). 
---
I played HoT back on release though, so while I did PoF story on a different character, I still knew what all was going on 
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/categories/game-release-notes
---
Guides for returning players are on the sidebar of this subreddit.
---
Friends to play and talk about the game with :(
---
I am torn between SoulBeast and Spellbreaker for now, as my Engineer levels.
---
Is there any fun having a longbow/greatsword with warrior or a dual sword/greadsword, or dagger-shield/greatsword?
---
and for soulbeast would dual swords be good?
---
It's because ranger doesnt have a role in big blob. It's essentially a roamer following a group of people and their websites doesnt offer roaming builds.
---
Definitely improved, good job!
---
reporting in now, 12:00 pm PST, divinity's reach turned back to normal
---
Cool, thanks.
---
Check to see how close you are to your monthly Chest of Loyalty. If you choose Legendary Crafting Materials it's 7 clovers. On average mystic clovers cost around 5g 76s. So you can save a chunk of resources by snagging some free clovers that way.
---
In low populated areas, I use medium settings and it gets to 40fps max, pushing it. The only place I can use medium/high is at fractals/pvp, with a steady 30fps in general. Today, at Lake Doric, I had to run everything at low and it performed at 15fps, which is barely playable.
---
I avoid WvW zergs because it is literally unplayable. At Teq, everything at lowest, it's 15fps as well.
---
The courage to get into fractals and learn chrono
---
Can i have one too?
---
i would love to but i only have Path Of Fire expansion, reaper would have been my nuumber 1 choice, i love the dark arts, and cool animations. 
---
As a break/save your sanity measure - gather the platinum that you need for the gift of metal. If you don't have a pick with glyph of the leatherworker, get a karma one and go hit up the rich platinum nodes in the appropriate zones, especially in mount maelstrom.  You will need 1000 plat ore, so the leatherworker pick will also get you about 330 rugged leather - sell it and buy something you need.  Further, leverage the map bonus rewards (currently shiny bauble -raw coin-  and hardened leather in the rotation for mount maelstron) by tagging/completing any quick events that you pass.  Next week is onyx stones/ectos/vicious claws.  If you still have excess karma you can dump it into the pact supply network agents mapping materials and consume on the best map.
---
They don't gut support classes in each patch. They just don't want to have one class giving every boon in the game while having insane cc, so they nerfed chaos chrono. Chrono is still good now and it opened up for other classes like Firebrand/renegade to become relevant
---
So, I guess this where folks like me come in handy. I put up buy orders for select gear and then salvage it myself and sell high on the resulting mats. The folks filling my buy orders are getting gear as drops and choosing to sell to folks like me rather than salvage themselves. The economy at work.
---
yeah for sure, but some don't stack well &amp; when you login to a map the stack order is random.  When it's a particle effect though you need to use different stats on the infusions otherwise you only see one of each type 
---
HOLY SHIT I FOUND THE BUG
---
...and we're back after a coffee break.
---
So far we've established the "sell instantly" button is active by default. Now let's see if the trade will actually go through in the client (and we know from experience the server is going to accept arbtrary sell orders. Again, no checks there, because fuck good practices. Let's just blindly trust the client :P)
---
	this.execute = function() {
---
		g.execute()
---
	}
---
	g = new s.OrderState,
---
	
---
Oh hey, I already have this module. How convenient. Let's isolate the execute method, mock some shit and annotate it some. We assume item is in player's inventory to avoid injecting the entire inventory checker here. `this.maxUnitPrice` attacks us again.
---
	{
---
		execute: function() {
---
			var mode = "sell",
---
			sellAmount = this.maxUnitPrice.get("amount"); // defaults to 0 on init
---
		
---
			return this.get("quantity") &lt; 1 ? __mock$error : i &lt; 1 ? __mock$error : (this.set("uiLocked", true), "buy" === mode ? this._executeBuy() : (true) ? this.get("listingFee") &gt; h.stats.coins ? __mock$error : this._executeSell() : __mock$error)
---
		}
---
	It looks like moneky shit so let's unwrap this abomination of a ternary statement, assume we have enough gold to pay the taxes, and throw away UI manipulation and checks that pass by default.
---
			sellAmount = 0;
---
			if(sellAmount &lt; 1) return mockError();
---
			this._executeSell();
---
	Uh oh. So `execute()` won't pass with default amount of 0. Let's dig deeper. Intermission: what happens if we try to *set* the amount to 0 anyway?
---
	minAmount: {
---
		value: void 0,
---
	...
---
	maxAmount: {
---
	minAmount and maxAmount are undefined by default (`void ` anything is undefined) so the mega-check in amount's setter will allow us to set the amount to 0. Okay. But `execute` won't pass in that scenario so we know the total copper amount has to be nonzero for a bugged sale to occur instead of returning `transactions.error.price.notzero`. And yet, it somehow does!
---
	NOW WAIT A MINUTE
---
	Let's assume this method passes and we get to `_executeSell()`. But what's this?
---
	_executeSell: function() {
---
			...
---
			return ... (this.get("instant") &amp;&amp; this.maxUnitPrice.set("amount", this.listings.get("buys")[0].unitPrice), void h.call("SellItem", {
---
				id: parseInt(s.itemId, 10),
---
				price: this.maxUnitPrice.get("amount"),
---
				...
---
				
---
	So, even *if* the UI has properly set the price of the item, *if* we're selling instantly, the price ALWAYS gets overriden by the top instant buy listing **WITHOUT PERFORMING THE `amount &lt; 1` CHECK!!!**
---
	But what happens if the list is EMPTY because it hasn't loaded yet? If we pass undefined to the amount's setter, due to how the setter is written, undefined will be turned to 0: `t = parseInt(t, 10) || 0`. Then further check will pass for undefined because comparisons with undefined are invalid and always return `false`, and `minAmount` is undefined by default! So if we don't initialize minAmount, we will be able to pass `undefined` to `amount`, resulting in 0! Let's check if the code actually initializes `minAmount` and with what value. And pray.
---
	_onFetchItem: function(t, s) {
---
		...
---
		minSellPrice = Math.max(h.vendor + 2, Math.ceil(h.vendor / .85)), this.maxUnitPrice.set("minAmount", minSellPrice)
---
	AAAAHHHHH
---
	MINIMUM SELL PRICE IS SET TO 2 COPPER ON ITEM DATA LOAD ALLOWING THE SALE TO PASS 
---
	BUT IF THE SELL ORDER LIST FAILS TO LOAD, THEN IT GETS RESET TO 0 COPPER AFTER IT WAS ALREADY CONFIRMED TO BE NONZERO
---
	AAAAAAHHHHH IT BURNS 
---
Yes, old zones have a mix of stuff to do from low level and high level stuff, so every area of the game gets reused and is active, it's all kind of mixed in. 
---
You'll see plenty of low levels and high levels in early zones.
---
anything
---
&gt; And yes this does mean WvW is literally uplayable for you, unless you feel like fighting 30 floating HP bars at 10fps. 
---
Oh god this was right on spot :D

You spect me to beleive there's a norn without belly hair?

This really warms me cockles. If only i were European.

---
What's your twitter? o: I'd love to commission some day.
---
you forgot the recipe part that includes 100 freshwater pearls, 100 maguuma lilies and 50 of each symbols.
---
Playable Tengu.
---
It just became a chore towards the end. The map felt simultaneously empty and yet, overpopulated based on performance. Just the number of extra models added for scenery made the area feel way too packed even if only like, three actual players were hanging around.
---
Maybe once I get my first naturally leveled 80 and start playing PvP more I'll actually join something like this.
---
Its great to have people who want PvP in an MMO to thrive! I used to play a ton of SW:ToR PvP, but since the game went down hill, I slowly migrated to GW2.
---
I'd go for a winterberry farm with multiple characters to get the obsidian shards quite quickly, then use the mystic forge to get the clovers, as you will generate a few T6 by that. I would not waste fractal relics on the clovers, as you'll probably need those for fractal god/whatever.
---
Then for everything gold related do a mixture of enjoy the game and farm the most profitable gold farm and buy mats from trading post.
---

Those shows what timezones the most points are made on each server.  I can't vouch for communities in EU though.

i like how the healing laser auto looks, i dont care about effiency on druid since i play it to chill out so i mostly ignore my other set and camp staff
---
Thank god, I was exhausted from giving all those gifts to Orphans erry day.
---
Empty? You are probably playing in off-peak hours or something. Everytime I wp-ed to DR, there was a lot of players around main areas.
---
*shodan plays gw2*
---
You mentioned improved screenshots... how much did he improve them?
---
This website is strictly for zerg play and not roaming indeed. The main issue for Ranger and Thief here is that everything they could do as part of a zerg squad something else can do it so much better or you can do it without having to be part of a squad/boon group (for example picking off the backlane or people late as a focus party)
---
Beautiful and disturbing at the same time :D
---
It was fun while it lasted. Let's hope for more mini-raids that are suitable for getting the playerbase interested in the gamemode. The Lair was perfect in that it had reasonable mechanics to learn but wasn't super punishing. It was definitely a step in the right direction!
---
It'd only add 12 armor sets.
---
I'd rather have all the gemstore "partial sets" to be turned into sets designed like Hellfire and Radiant. Have the helm, shoulders, gloves, and boots be the same across armor classes, just the chest and leggings differ.
---
A bit less work than actual doing an armor set for all three classes, and gives the illusion of mixing armor classes together.
---
power reaper doing 34k dps or more
---
T3 is the proverbial trench. Learn the mechanics well, buy the AR if you need to, and graduate to T4 ASAP.
---
I think the reason is that "armored look" or "scholarly look" are far, far more general than "trenchcoat look".
---
Charr look so much better when they aren’t hunched over like 90 year old men
---
Unpopular opponion: Stance Share SoulB is criminally underrated against ranged groups. With Imob Tempest gaining a little traction it would be super nice to have [Dolyak Stance](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dolyak_Stance) if your Revs don't run Dwarf (WTF?) and your guards don't have the cleanse mantra (double WTF?).
---
Basically it shouldn't be necessary but people still run Spellbreaker and not getting imob in Winds can really help people out. (Though with less SBs running around resistance should cover everything)
---
im with you on this one, thats exactly what happened it only shows Anets understanding of there own game sadly, im sure you have seen Noodys video about thief matchups, we really only have 2 for sure matchups where as mesmer can easily beat just about all classes easily. 
---
You might as well just copy the entire GW2 folder, assuming it's all up to date you should be able to just launch and play. 
---
Before you do this though, run "gw2.exe -image" to be sure the image on your computer is the freshest it can be.
---
For the past couple weeks (as I had been off from work), I was playing at a variety of times and days. I saw huge crowds there, but I've also been there during midday and it was a ghost town.
---
My entire point however, before this derailment, was that even *with* low player count, the model count from trees, NPCs, snowmen, etc etc was so high I was having some performance issues even when it was mostly vacant of players. The place being packed with players only worsened that issue. That was the entire point of my comment 
---
I do this every time now. They say if you are just after gold go for the 20 laurels. Though If you ever use clovers they are worth more and harder to acquire. 
---
Someone else already mentioned it but I'll repeat it, PUGs get so much better at T4. People are familiar with the mechanics, and with their own rotations/jobs in the group. I haven't had a problem with a T4 group in weeks
---
Yoda base?
---
that's for sure, I'm an enemy and a supporter of this speculation, though.  I can see downsites of the 2nd death and not having the same impact on a player, but who knows, right? 
---
Take it please as a very unlikely possibility. :)                                                                                      
---
Also, Tumblr no longer allows pornographic imagery.
---
Well for raids one druid is pretty necessary but there is no good reason to run 2 druids most other heal builds will be better than a second druid. Dont know about pugging but with my group at new raids we run 2 healers on the hardest boss for a couple months before we get good enough for a single druid. 2 healers would be just fine for a lot of people.
---
Reworked Scrapper with interesting profession mechanic and cool utility skills.
---
I believe it's reportable if you're kicked right before a boss is killed, just to fuck you over. Other than that, you just move on. 
---
Power holo all day I use sword with grenade kit    With pistol offhand and sometimes shield when I’m having a bad night lol it’s fun flashy and does great dps    Rifle is slightly less dps but better cc and more burst if I remember correctly. It’s been awhile since I’ve played rifle( I have bolt and quip so ya) 
---
Berserker's Power lasts 15 seconds and can stack up to three times, whether that's in one big burst or three single bar bursts.
---
Realistically there is no reason to have a second druid.
---
now they refuse to let pvp devs push updates while limiting what they can do.

Oh, haha. I do have a drawing of people kissing, so I thought he meant that. :P 
---
Exactly. The saying should be amended to "if you're not going for a legendary, get the laurels".
---
Class-specific keybinds
---
A couple other things to keep in mind are your tool-belt skills and elixir. Before getting holo, I liked running with rifle, flame turret, grenades, elixir U. U gives the swiftness when I would switch to rifle and get crazy auto attack damage in. Probably wasn't the best build, but I had fun and could kill a lot of non-vet mobs pretty quickly
---
Are you on eu or na? 
---
If you were willing to join LFGs before, this shouldn't change anything. There will always be asshole commanders and rage quitters. It's the price to pay for not having statics. Don't let it discourage you, just do your best, have a positive mental attitude, and encourage your team in a positive manner.
---
I bet you draw them holding hands too, ya degenerate.

the commander did, but I think the commander will lead the Fleet and his Guild to the destruction so they will die with him...

I do have a static, most of us are just on break because of it being the holidays and all (and we raid tuesdays and the last two tuesdays have been Christmas and New Year's Day respectively so...)

I would hop on youtube, Woodenpotatoes does game of the days that are both entertaining and informative.

Here is a warrior build, might help: https://youtu.be/zMgT4ciCt1A

had this happen to me when playing to kill a god.  Not having a high dps, it took me a long time to kill balthazar.  When i finally did and the cut scene started playing, I dc'd.

This isn't the first time this has hapoened but it will be my last.  While I still play, I'm just not going to spend the money on the story anymore until they fix their game.

Getting a mail from Ela Makkay telling my character that she should go see her now that she is awake. Learning that she killed some really mean Sylvari but got caught in the explosion of her Breachmaker and got tended to ever since. Realize that she can't remember anything of the past year because of the shock. Having to visit every remaining trace of Season One and talk to people and view cinematics to understand what went on. Being called by friends she doesn't remember to the Dead End and having every single one of them trying to get her to remember the hard battles and the good moments. Finally recovering memory and preparing for Season Two. Getting a daily Season One related task afterward (Fractal, kill remaining minions, do JP etc.) to gain the APs that I may be missing from the pool of Season I achievements so that every player can hope to bridge the AP gap.
---
This is my wish.
---
I want one for my friend :D
---
Might be too much for tumblr to be honest
---
&gt;  all i want is good community and active server  
---
same
---
Then yeah, love your static and never let go. LFG sucks.
---
Haha yea, I logged on my vanilla/release 80 Thief and my build had sprint on the bar, couldn’t play without it. I also never got rid of short bow just so I could use the double teleport. Mounts feel so great now.
---
Omg please yes
---
My 1k Herald Regen ticks say Hi :D :D :D In all seriousness though I find far too many pug druids don't even use regen at all, when it's super strong especially given how easy it is to keep up nowadays. Remember when it was the longest single application got priority? Dark days indeed.
---
Probabaly, but would take a lot of time etc
---
2K gems plz :D
---
We always said “sir” in PT
---
So many wrong things here.
---
1) Revenant can share boons to 10 man. In fact, if you look at it, you'd see that it's actually better at sharing 10 man boons than Chrono.  
---
Renegade can give 10 man Alacrity without having to rely on positioning Tides of Time or Well of Recall. Herald can give 10 man Might, Fury,   
---
Protection, Swiftness, Regen with no boon duration at all (no 25 Might without BD of course). 
---
2) Most people don't realize how hard Chrono was nerfed this last patch. Currently if you run a 2 Chrono comp one of the Chronoes HAS to take Time Warp for initial quickness. This means that the total CC of 2 Chronoes has decreased by A LOT.
---
3) Chrono's strong point is no longer its capability of sharing Alacrity/Quickness at the same time or its CC potential. The strong point of Chrono at the moment is their focus pull which is INSANELY POWERFUL on a lot of fights and their ability at tanking the bosses without moving. For this reason I would say that ONE Chrono will always be a part of a pug raid squad.
---
4) Once the Diviner patch hits this will make Power Renegade very strong. This build will do good damage (around 23/27k small/large hitbox) while giving 10 man Alacrity and also bringing Assasin's Presence and Soulcleave's Summit. By taking Staff as off-hand weapon this build will be able to apply more CC than 2 Chronos combined on large hitboxes. So more options are on their way :)  
---
You are right it is entirely possible for a 2nd death to have a big impact to the player.
---
I for one would love for us to go to the mists again and be greeted by your faction mentor. I really want that Tybalt and Demmi interaction one last time and if they did that it would make it a very emotional moment for me.
---
Maybe even an interaction with Trahearne or another we have lost in the past. I feel like when we did this in PoF and our guide was someone we have never met before was a bit weak. I understand why they did it but damnit let me see Tybalt and Demmi again!

Now you can choose to become a victim of this fact. Or you can choose to get in touch with the organizers, in an appropriate manner, and see if split-timed qualifiers are a possibility or suggest a time that would benefit the majority of possible contenders.

hey man nice. This is what I've been using. heard it was the icyveins of GW2 haha. Thanks for taking the time to respond!
---
OG Lineage M is only a thing in Korea. In the rest of the world, L2R is doing better. L2R is a garbage p2w mobile game but all you need is a wide net to catch whales. 
---
GW2 knows that in the wide sea the casual PvE player base is easier to cater for and profit off of than trying to make a PvP game. They showed very early they did not have a great grasp on managing the continued support for the PvP/WvW side of things, and it continued to deteriorate from there.
---
Yes, everyone will be playing as Faren from now on unless you remembered to save your game before the fight.
---
I think creating too much striation between levels of difficulty in PvE content does little to encourage personal player improvement. It can also have the opposite effect you think it does as it creates an entirely different tier of player rather that the desired effect of bridging the gap between. It also removes quite a bit of integrity from the design process as it establishes multiple baseline difficulty thresholds that designers have to adhere to separately. Having to design for this phenomena can hinder the normal raid design and vice versa with the easy mode raids hindering the normal mode design process. You also have to consider that there's very little vertical progression in this game.   
---
Arguably, separate difficulty thresholds are more important in games like WoW where gear score and gear-power-creep is an artificial progression mechanic. There's no need for that in GW2 because you only have (realistically) two classes of gear: exotic &amp; ascended, which is only a 5% overall increase in stats from exotic (legendary and ascended are the same) - compare that to the scaling and gear-power-creep in WoW. And further, I think most of the raids currently in GW2 right now are not really even mechanically challenging more than they are phase-distinct and require basic knowledge of how to play each phase. Therefore, the difficulty is less essentially-mechanical, but experiential.   
---
It's not a crime to want easy mode LFR, but it harms the integrity of the design, creates striation in the playerbase, makes the formation process a joke, amplifies the visibility of class imbalance, and so on. It's something GW2 honestly doesn't mechanically need and it would harm the game more than help.
---
I saw some people talking about condi mirage, is that good for any/all encounters?
---
Shared dolyak stance lasts 3s. RIP ranger dream.
---
The main thing is that it's easier to give a pug Druid latitude for covering the essentials; 25 might, fury than it is other classes. For example, a Guardian would have to run either Sword or Axe both of which require melee space vs. ~~social awkwardness~~.  Scourge can't provide Fury.  Neither can Renegade.  Herald can via one of the facets; however, if you ever need to re-seed it you're stuck on a legend that offers no healing capabilities, and that hurts.  
---
I regularly pug Fractal CMs and am earning Fractal God tomorrow.  The main reason you see people asking for Druid is because it's a much simpler and more straight-forward way of providing critical boons (25 Might, Fury) in a larger radii than alternative classes.  Being able to provide might via Rejuvenating Tides or lay down a bonfire for some quick might blasting via Staff 3, Warhorn 5, Banners and whomever else may be paying attention is actually really nice quality of life.  It means you waste less CA prebuffing.  
---
Furthermore, Druid can do "spot-healing" -- aka -- you can give people love taps with CA3 and CA1 spam.  Furthermore, something people don't consider is that Druid has a considerable number of both light fields, water fields and blast finishers.  Blast finishers in a light field cleanse 1 conditions off of 5 people; that's significant.  Other than Ventari most healers struggle w/ condi-pressure.  CA2 has the additional bonus of being an AoE blind for more dangerous trash mobs.  Healing Spring is also pretty powerful traited as well. 
---
There's definitely merit for alternative healers like Scourge, Renegade or Firebrand if you play in an organized static or semi-static, but when you're pugging you want to cover all your bases -- you don't want to place too many eggs in to many baskets.  In my experience playing Firebrand, Renegade &amp; Herald most things other than Druid have much, much more limited might-sharing capabilities.  If you aren't within ~ 600 range when they're generating might then you're pretty screwed.  Whereas with Druid almost all healing you do generates might.  It's something don't really consider until they've played an alternative healer. 
---
The issue isn't that Druid is an amazing healer.  It isn't.  It's everything else that it brings to the table that other classes can't really compete with; spirits; on-demand AoE stability, light fields/solid condition cleanse, multiple blast finishers, both fire and *smoke* fields which are criminally under-utilized by pugs.  Pet CC is also really underrated.  As much as people love to hate on ArenaNet's pet AI there's no question that things like Iboga, Blue Wyvern, Rock Gazelle, Pink Moa, Smokescale (Smoke field) or Jacaranda are useful.  Having powerful CC outside of your "normal" rotation is really, *really* underrated.  
---
It's true that you can visit Dregehaunt Cliffs and pick up some consumable metal-rods, planks and rocks for usage in FoTM, but that sort of optimization is something that's very rare to see in a pug setting.  The pets have the advantage of being very consistent and low-effort; whereas if you fudge up the timing on your CC on alternative healers (eg; Staff Rev, Torch 5 Scourge, Golem positioning) then you're pretty much either out of energy or stuck in a few perpetual frames of feelsbadman. 
---
Had it, and the opposite, male mentioned as female.
---
But you can move freely with strafe. I watch youtube videos from new players a lot. And their most complaint is how weird the movment is until someone tell them to change to strafe. Or they figure it out later.  Turn just mess up your movements overall when new.
---
Honestly, my boyfriend would love this dress, but I really don't love it. 
---
Hey man thanks for the input ill check Noody out. I've seen shorts intro to Mesmer videos and they helped a little. unfortunately for me I can watch a video a million times and it just doesn't stick.. 
---
3 days later Uber moves into GW2 and takes over the market.
---
I feel like I would manage to kill or seriously maim myself in this dress. 
---
&gt;Not happening. It's not because of resources, it's because of how GW2 pvp works. It's great as player experience, but horrible as spectating experience (crux of being fit to be an e-sport).   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Visually the combat is a huge clusterfuck that even spectators (let alone combatants themselves) have difficulty following. A 1v1 on a node between a spellbreaker and a reaper may be a fun watch, but move over to middle node, or just place a mesmer or two with their endless clones and it instantly turns into unwatchable clusterfuck.   
---
&gt;On top of that is the huge readability problem with same professions on both sides. Especially if you're the viewer. That well of suffering ....that blue team necro or red team necro?   
---
&gt;And what about character models? You can have a fucking ele looking like a warrior (outfit), or a two players looking exactly identical leading to huge problems identifying whom you're fighting actually.   
---
&gt;With all that chaos and potential for deception, GW2 pvp is fun as hell to play, but shit to watch. And no viewers = no e-sports. No e-sports = no armies of new pvpers starved for fame and fortune = no big competitive scene = game stays PvE focused.
---
Didn't play a single day of Wintersday this year outside of running the raid once :/
---
Cantha
---
There are plenty of great replies already, but the bottom line is that GW2 is free to play (with some QoL restrictions) so there's no downside to just giving it a go and seeing if it floats your boat!
---
It’s from Love Nikki! Fun mobile game
---
That might mess up alot of collections.
---
Sad. I wanted to visit Tixx's Infirnarium one last time.
---
That's not really friendly for mass salvaging ...
---
Elementalist mechanic where we enter an "arcane state" where we float and can switch between a bar of offensive and a defensive/support skills.
---
What is it? I'll tell you what it is! It's the eve of Wintersday eve eve eve ^eve ^^eve ^^^eve...
---
Imo this works way better. If you have needs or demands you make your group and ask for it. Can be the speedclear know all be all and fuck you if you miss 5 dps in that boss. Or it can be I am new and want to learn, all welcome. Both groups get what they want and noone need to be upset about it the lack of something, may it be patience or maybe it be dps.
---
I think you simply need to accept that we do it differently and it is us the players who create the groups and manage them instead of the game throwing us in were we might not want to be. 
---
Cool GS legendary.
---
To have more than one wish!
---
There have been a lot of little tweaks, but chronomancer was changed in a way that impacted the entire raiding meta.
---
If you're not part of that or don't play chrono, just make have a glance at your characters' changes in the release notes. 
---
&gt; It is not a crime to want to play this content on easy mode.

But it is to be handled everything on a silver platter.

I'm a simple dude. I like to run my own experimental builds that I find fun, and I'm good at using them. But they're not meta builds.

Which is fine because challenging content isn't for everyone. Don't blame the system, blame your own capabilities, it's not like raids are impossible to play. There's plenty of easy content in the game already.
---
could also be different between EU and NA. Overall PvE is more empty in NA. Not saying there are less players i have no clue, just the time zone might be the reason.
---
FYI, we use adult actors even for child roles. (Many female VO actors have amazing range and can convincingly play kids of any gender.)
---
&gt; But I also have the same issues with Light and Heavy Armors. Why do most Light armors on male characters seemingly lose about 75% of the fabric when translated to female characters, especially cultural armors? What if I want to be scantily-clad as a male character?
---
I have no stats to back this up, but it's a guess i'm pretty sure about.
---
Male and female armours are for guys, because both gender get mainly played by guys, even tho MMOs in general have a pretty big group of female players too.
---
Nobody stops you from making a relaxed raid group on lfg.
---
Something to know too if you're just starting is that Thief and Mesmer are the two most mechanically difficult classes to play, let alone master. They both have a number of tricks and combos that you really NEED to learn and get down to effectively play. Mesmer also has a few fairly complex bursts that you're just going to have to practice over and over and over again until it becomes second nature. If you're hopping straight into spvp with either of these classes it will definitely feel like you're scraping your face on pavement for a while... If you get them to lvl 80 though WvW is a great place to hone your mechanical muscle memory in a much more relaxed way. 
---
And you're just as bad as he is 
---
Trust me, I feel the same way. No point in getting immersed in a story if it’s just going to kick you out of it. Hell, happened to me when I fought Balthazar too. Raged quit for a good 2weeks.
---
Select a waypoint from a list of favorites when logging in with a char.
---
It's absolutely disgusting how good it is on some encounters. Condi Mirage is considered top tier condi DPS for most condi-favored raid bosses, except for Dhuum (Condi Renegade) and Sabetha (Condi Scourge). Just to give you an idea, the meta raid comp for Cairn and Matthias recommends 6x Condi Mirage.
---
Out of curiosity, how do you know you're good at using them?
---
Thanks for the tip. Gonna start spamming the attack button like crazy lol
---
LFR is one of the maireason that WoW is dying right  now, "easy" mode wont solve anything there are people that think the Wintersday Raid was "too hard" they will ask for an easy mode then complain on how the rewards arent good enough or how its not easy enough, people find story mission too hard.
---
well before the runecrafting change, salavging meant extraction of upgrades. afaik... now with a rephrased black lions kit... yeah well. Sophism to get people to spend gems on a revamped extract o'matic
---
RE Taimi, if you check out my posts after S4E1, you’ll get a sense of what’s ahead for her. We have a lot of players living with disabilities and the last thing we would want to do is simply exploit her disease for cheap pathos. Not interesting to us.
---
RE Debi voicing Aurene, that’s a pretty funny idea. :-)
---
no it sounds like you want to go in full blues, spam 1 and "feel" like you're actually competent
---
It was my story instance, so that wasn't it.
---
I am sure Anet is happy that they created a game that requires players to join a group outside the game that in turn requires players to follow a build and rotation created by some self-declared experts. All that just to play the game's content. 
---
make your own squad and run that shit there
---
That's a lot of dolleridoos 😅
---
Hey guys, is there any pvp tier list?
---
I’m currently building spellbreaker but it seems to be in a bad spot right now, so I’m thinking in switching for gs guardian but not sure anyways. :)
---
You dont need to, it just makes it a lot faster and easier. Whats the difference of wiping for 10 hours in meta builds and wiping for 10 hours because you used random builds? Desire and dedication to raid, thats the answer you're looking for, something that a lot of vocal people are lacking. Raids arent supposed to be world bosses so you can spam 1 on your flamethrower engi with 5 turrets.
---
Maybe is Oasis, but it depend on materials... my oasis look similar but totally different weight so not sure.
---
&gt; i want to play raids, not deal with groups in the way they.
---
Raiding is group content. Therefore, you will *always* have to deal with groups -- it's like asking 'why doesn't GW2 have a singleplayer mode'.
---
&gt;There is no way I am the only one who feels that way, in fact its likely that people who actually tried any kind of raiding would want to have an easier way of playing them sometimes.
---
The raid encounters are pretty easy, even for players who don't have good DPS. It's all about learning the mechanics. Making them easier would reduce them to world boss level, e.g. Unbound Guardian in Bloodstone Fen.
---
&gt;What wow has done is amazing with their LFG-Raid thing, its just so intuitive and easy to get into.
---
WoW is not GW2. GW2 is not WoW. Both games function on different principles, and asking GW2 to be more of a WoW clone is pointless.
---
It's the same amount of klicks as before the new kit was introduced (if you wanted the optimal result). Anyway it's just a comparison, no one is pushing you to change your salvage habits.
---
How do you exactly know that open world people would actually do raids? Is it really worth the effort developing an easy mode for people that may consider the wintersday mini raid hard? How much anet must simplify the raids for open world people to join this content?
---
To be quite honest, I see absolutely no point in simplifying raids since our current raids require at least some effort. If Anet removes challenge and good rewards then people will not do them at all just because there are better ways to make money or have fun. Also Anet never goes back to previous content in order to simplify or redesign it unless it allows players to farm money or materials in insane amounts. 
---
&gt;Might dependent on field blasting
---
Every Guardian will be your friend. "*area condi cleanse, area condi cleanse, area condi cleanse*" :D
---
However, viability on support classes is always good. 
---
&gt;Maybe make it so health stays at what you cleaved it down to and make respawning while the group is still in fight possible. Something like that, at some point you will pick up the mechanics.
---
If GW2 players actually learned without an incentive, people wouldn't be stacking on the edges during the Wyvern Matriarch encounter in VB. Or attacking the abomination during Triple Trouble at Amber, or CC-ing properly during the Shatterer meta. 
---
Remove the need to learn and the vast majority of players will not learn.
---
You don't pay much attention do you. Ok one last time then i am done. Strafe dose not give clunky movments. Turn does. There for Strafe will always beat turn. Not to mention most of us old players swap to strafe because again it is not possible to play the game with it in a fluent way. 
---
I mean if you see a person turn in WvW then i know he is new and you will kill him before he know what hits him. How often do you use turn in PvP and PvE? I mean do you turn in fractals? Would have you killed so fast. It is not making people favors by keeping Turn on default instead of swapping it to Strafe. 
---
I don't even get why you argue it since i am fairly sure you do not use turn in your daily game play. I don't even know anyone who does. Do you?
---
That's the reality of pug life. Dps players that fail all dps checks and quit on the second wipe. 
---
Like at some point people learned to not CC instantly on DS, CC Vinetooth prime in AB, wyverns in VB? Jump over the wave on tequatl? Of course no because they dont have to since mechanics arent punishing enough (or at all). 
---
First time I entered t4 fracs I got absolutely demolished by mechanics. Why? Because t1-t3 ones werent punishing at all. Was I prepared for t4 after doing every single t1-t2 fractal for months and months as f2p? Hell no. Easy raids wouldnt do anything either.
---
Salvage kits salvaged gear, it didn't recover it.
---
LFR in wow aren't all about autoattacks either. There is a way to make it easy enough for people to learn the raids by actually playing
---
Keep an eye on [ANet's blo](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/)g, that way you'll miss less stuff going on.
---
This game mode is so dead that the guy who drew a charr has more upvotes.  Anet let this mode die. All the competitive players have left. Only bots, win traders and season farmers remain. GW PvP was great. GW2 PvP is a joke. 
---
I don't track my income, but as I'm neither a trader, hardcore farmer or crafter, I guess it's from about the same sources as yours - T4, daylies, raid and random loot. It's your decision how you want to salvage it, but I found it interesting to compare the kits, do find the best way to get rid of all the unid gear thats piling up in my bank.
---
For some people it's endgame
---
Yet you're still complaining about bunch of pixels. 
---
I didnt mean you personally in my previous comment, more like a type of players who think raids are hard to get into.
---
Just in case you aren't aware, you can actually participate in sPvP at any level, you don't need to be max level, or get any gear for it, everyone has the same level/gear in PvP more or less. 
---
Dyeable weapons at least one channel like energy color or something on them.
---
Yeah it has been off, we kinda figured out with another commenter that it was G-sync related and the problem fixed itself with turning G-sync on and off but I have no idea what caused it in the first place. 
---
If kudzu ain't ya thing then you're in luck! The legendary normie bow will release on Jan 8th! 
---
Is condi soulbeast not that good in raids anymore? Is it good enough to keep it for when there's already a druid or two in the squad? Is it worth it to change the stats of the gear for power, or maybe gear another profession with that gear?
---
Is it even worth it for that? Seems extremely niche for a gem store purchase. What do you really get that's worth a damn that wou wouldn't already get from a copper/mystic combo?
---
*     Black lion for everything that has expensive upgrades
---
*     Mystic/silver-fed for everything that drops ectos (rare/exo &gt; 67lv)
---
*     Basic/copper-fed for everything else
---
I mean, if we are serious here, motes cost like 12c each. And essences seem to flow readily. Is it really worth the gems and a shared slot?
---
There is an obvious difference between "Sylvari-humanoid" and "Charr-humanoid". That's what I'm referring to.
---
Upgradable skills. Some system to improve your skills that takes at least some time and effort to cap. I think we could use some more vertical progression, just not in the form of gear. 
---
I'll probably just stick with silver for everything, nice and simple, albeit inefficient.
---
[Gods of PvP](https://www.godsofpvp.net/) has guides and builds as well as [metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Conquest).
---
test
---
I'm not sure I know what you mean by clunky movement. I assume you mean that you have a fixed turning speed while turning with A and D.
---
&gt; Strafe will always beat turn
---
You mean keyboard turning, right? Because if you're turning with Right-click held and moving the mouse, A and D become strafing while the right mouse button is depressed.
---
What I personally use is irrelevant to the discussion. There exist plenty of players out there in the MMO space that turn using their keyboard. They are often derided for it, especially in pvp settings, but those players exist.
---
I don't know why you're arguing since nothing you've said negates my point that were a company like ANet to change the default on people, it would lead to a similar amount of confusion for new players who would then not be able to figure out how to turn because they wouldn't know to use the RMB, and would also lead to a bevvy of complaints from existing players who do use A and D to turn and wouldn't immediately know how to switch it back to how they're used to.
---
And if you're going to come back with "Oh, they'll figure out how to use the RMB or change the controls." Well, they can just as easily figure out how to change the controls right now to make A and D strafe without the RMB depressed.
---
Congrats. I hate the art direction this game has went.
---
Well, I guess I can do all solo content without problems (I know that's not hard). I can kill Liadri, do that 8-orbs-thing, or kill turai ossa for example. I feel useful in group content or the wintersday raid. I can adapt to boss mechanics quickly, which is probably more important than my off-meta-builds. I don't calculate rotations, I just make up rotations that feel good to me.
---
To be honest, if I really really wanted to raid, I could probably get into it without too many issues. It's just that it demotivates me to change all my builds to meta-builds and craft meta-gear for all of my characters, and to find 9 other people whos schedule I fit into.
---
This argument irritates me. Those self-declared experts spend days theorycrafting and testing to find the best builds after every single balance patch, and share their efforts with the community so that we can clear raids just as efficiently as they do. Many people care about bringing their best to the team and consider these builds a valuable resource. You don't have to use them (because raids aren't nearly difficult enough for them to be necessary) but, you know, they do make things a hell of a lot easier. 
---
I don't think that raids puggable though? Succes rate of 10 random people thrown together would be pretty low I guess.
---
Is guardian hammer better than spellbreaker gs? I’m a bit newbie and I’d like to spend my (little) resources on the best warr or guardian viable build possible. 
---
I don’t really want to play mirage or scourge or some other top build because I don’t like those classes.
---
Plenty of people get income for mats. For an open world guy like me this makes a difference. I have done T4 fractals, but I don't do the regularly. I don't raid.  I spend more time doing stuff like Dragonstand, AB and VB meta, zone completes, gathering. 
---
I tend to save all my unided gear, until I can use buffs to open them all at one time with as much magic find as I can, thus maximizing rares and exotics. 
---
I tend to sell the blue unided gear, but I open green, rare and exotics. It works for me.
---
I'm not interested in flipping, because I don't have the attention span. I'm not particularly interested in running challenging content every day either.   I think there are probably as many people like me as there are like you.
---
But it's not just income from materials. I craft a lot of stuff and I keep a lot of the materials so I don't have to buy which saves me money as well.
---
Yeah, but class mastery is a thing. And PvE helps to learn skills and such.
---
An opinion is a judgment, viewpoint, or statement that is not conclusive. 
---
So yes, it was my opinion and still is.
---
Emi trains are super hype!

Being top DPS in a Gorseval pug that wiped for 4 hours isn't really an achievement, sorry.

This sounds like a common mistake. New LS chapter next week (the 8th). I think people just assumed Wintersday would end when that episode dropped, but they did announce the holiday would end on the 2nd.
---
Lets be clear, all of those are good things and can be quite helpful in random groups/solo play (it's actually very good to do that in solo play).
---
However, in most organized groups you wouldnt need to do all that because there are optimal builds for every situation so you can either ignore certain mechanic by having strong burst damage or having a support who can deal with that, but most often it's a combination of both. But again, it doesnt hurt knowing what your class can do and help group if they are clueless about their classes. It's just a lot easier to skip a mechanic than adapt to group fails.
---
Before I started doing any harder content I used to swap between all 4 elements, use basically all necessary skills for damage, kiting, cc and so on, but I could also just do a simple 5-skill part of dps rotation with maybe different weapon/utilities and kill enemies immediately. And it actually felt impactful because I used utility skills when actually needed (which isnt that often if you burst everything down) rather than as precaution.
---
Try a meta build and adapt from there, you'll notice big difference in performance.
---
I vote Engi. Condi may not be viable right now, but it floats in and out, and it is like playing a piano when it comes around. Holosmith makes me feel like yoda (I play asura) with a flurry of wide reaching attacks, a resource bar to manage, and multiple kits to weave into your cooldown phase. Scrapper has its place in Pvp, WvW and even open world content. Your builds can be as tanky or glassy as you want them to be, though tankiness comes at the expense of dmg, and vice versa. Finally, if you like farming istan, or any zerg open world farm, engineer is a Godsend. Flame thrower + turrets makes tagging everything a breeze.

I use a Razer Tartarus. It is like 1/3 of a keyboard with a thumbstick. Thumbstick makes movement control very nice, plus wasd are freed up for binds.

Exotic is quite cheap actually, you can buy it on TP or from dungeons/karma vendors for example. It's a huge improvement over rare gear.

Interesting pitch, I like it?

Mr.freezies raid was pretty much the most unique thing of this year's Wintersday.

Archer-nature freak-nature freak is my favorite class and I agree.

Amazon is a legit seller, yes. As long as you're buying from amazon and not a random seller in their marketplace, you're good to go :)

Polymock is wish #1.  All others are #2 or lower.

The wording might be a bit misleading, yes. You can try to get a refund from the support, if you write a ticket.

In before naruto asuras

Arcane gives allies boons on attunement swap too. Keep in mind, though, that protection is really good on Tempest since Tempest has higher protection damage-reduction.

i only need 1 more claw kill, i just killed it and didn't get the thing, i realized that i need 1 year to do a 10min event to get that 1k g skin.

i think it's interesting too. im not being sarcastic though- i want to know if it really makes a huge difference. i get up to 250 of a material over the course of a few weeks and then sell it for a payoff of.. 1-5 gold? except ectos and brandsparks i didnt know anyone was making any kind of dollar off of mats in 2019

Yu got a problem?

My main norn elementalist wear the same clothes since one year now. I photobomb everytime i can. The colors are just reverse for me. ^^

You aren’t required to follow a build or rotation to play the game’s content. It is true that Snow Crows builds are frequently referenced and advocated because they spend a lot of time figuring out how to play most effectively, but you can come up with your own skill rotations if thats what you want to do. Theres even a training golem in the special forces area where you can practice and see your dps.

Roy, i love you

Mmh, I see. I thought the Istan event trains are the way to go atm. There's none of my friends left in game, it's harder than I expected to catch up to everything that has changed and is going on.  Anyways, thanks!
