Well the ring, Coalescense can only be made with PoF.

In the time it takes you to find and participate in a VB map for the coat, though, you could have gotten a full set of the Mistforged *and* unlocked super easy recipes to make more of any weight you want. I had an entire set within a day of the release of Dragonfall, and I've since made two more for other alts without even putting a dent in my mistborn motes, and I don't even play the map that often -- I just run it a couple of times per week.
---

---
If you already have a ton of VB currency, by all means use them on some armor and try to find a meta map for the coat... but personally I'd rather use Dragonfall for Diviner's so I can use my VB currency for other hard-to-get stats instead.
---
Yes, but where are the other mordrem mobs is what I'm asking
---
It's certainly A Way, but it's nowhere close to the easiest way.
---
I hate that anet has players conditioned to think that utilizing legit game mechanics is abuse.  I do think anet needs to adjust in game mechanics with unintended results to get them in line with what they anticipated.  However, it’s not abuse or exploitation.
---
Not quite. The achievement progress was not supposed to stop with the cap. The lootcap itself is still a thing as far as I know. But you can finish your "do it 15 times" achievement in one go now.
---
G2A is not an approved seller by the Lionguard and can lead to trouble if bought from. Just stick with the approved merchants so I don't have to come bail you out, recruit.

The question is: How many Ap you've already got? Around 36k-ish? Than go for gw1. If you only do it for the AP and Skins of cause.
---
If you are looking for another game with an entirely other take that is still quite similiar in names and places than buy gw1. If you are more on the puzzle side of games it will not let you down. Learning the game is hard, really hard but luckily we are living in an era of quick information excess. So many years ago I would have said getting 50/50 will take you at least a couple thousand hours but nowadays - with guides and the fact that the whole game is basically beaten for years - it may be possible to achieve in a few but dedicated months. Depends on your gametime, your motivation and of cause your ability to learn and adept. Gw1 has not the ultra mechanical moment to moment gameplay that gw2 can have but it is way more top heavy especially for new players with things to learn and remember. Paired with the fact that a single mistake (sometimes this mistake can be to enter a mission or map without the right skills on your bar) can really screw you over the stakes are simply a bit higher at the beginning. One thing I can say is: preperation is the key in gw1. This and the acknowledgment that failure will help you learning.
---
Not the best, but the easiest to play with no skill. Just press 1 and sit back lol.
---
You need to do actual stuff kill stuff faster, which lets you get through content faster. It’s usually more interesting to actually do something rather than sit around.
---
Power reaper’s strength is that it’s a nice mix between survivability and dps. It’s noob friendly for those who want to achieve decent dps (some where near 4 times minion master).
---
But from a more elite pve player, reaper is garbage (along with heal scourge in most situations) because there are other classes that have higher dps and skilled players don’t need survivability.
---
Minion master, reaper, and other meta dps all cater to a specific player. It’s all about context as to what is best. There is no general “best” build.
---
For OP, minionmaster may be an option, as he is new and probably doing just open world. And for open world, dps doesn’t matter. That’s the beauty of it; it’s inclusive, yet it’s flashy. Not everybody WANTS to do amazing dps (I feel ya tho I turn off arc in world bosses or I just cry inside) and that’s ok. I think it’s important to suggest multiple builds for different needs, such as minion master for beginners and power reaper for actual dps.
---
As the bot said: Don't do it.
---
Good bot.
---
good bot!
---
That doesn't really answer OP's question about gear though.
---
I think heal FB is great, but not with more toughness than the tank -- which they'll have if they're running full Minstrel.
---
As the bot said, no, G2A is not recommended. We hear so many stories of people who got "such a great deal!" from them only to have their key revoked because oops, it was bought with a stolen credit card and the owner issued a charge back and then you're locked out of your account. Sure, you can sometimes work with ANet to get access back by buying a real key, but why sit on a ticking time bomb? Just go the legit route to begin with.
---
 If it helps, there will probably be a 50% sale on the official store for GW2's birthday at the end of August. If you can hold off as a F2P player til then, I would do that.
---
I think that's the joke
---
In lore I could understand it as them not trying to offend sylvari (even thou there are enough none-Sylvari mordrem) In game as just not wanting to add hologram filters to the mordrem.
---
  
---
I was similarly disappointed that they didnt add a new candy for mordremoth: Mordremarshmellows would be so great,
---
Oh boy I'm getting downvoted for this...
---
So, in my opinion, almost all of Path of Fire was complete dogshit. So when we had expansion launch it seemed pretty good, story content was polished, maps looked interesting and I was curious about what developers have in store for me. But right after I was done with the story and map completion I discovered there was nothing more to discover, I was done with expansion and if I wanted to do something I basically had to go back to HoT. 
---
If you look at separate game modes things aren't looking great either. WvW develops the most obnoxious and unfun meta we ever had (and still have btw) with scourge and firebrand dominating everything, PvP is getting terrorized for like a year by condi mirage, and raid release schedule (&amp;difficulty) is getting worse with every wing. And I don't really have to say much about Siren's Reef and Twilight Oasis, do I?
---
Living world episodes are short and easily forgetable, maps feel hollow and reward structure for events is a total failure - well at least until last episode of the season. Everything feels rushed and unfinished (member long live the lich?) Content instead of being fun, interactive and full of new gameplay mechanics instead is just frustrating and feels more like a labor. The only expection is Jahai, this map was pretty cool actually.
---
If I had to compare end of HoT and PoF, which one was a better game or better MMORPG, I'd choose HoT and it wouldn't be even close.
---
I am getting back into the game because some of my friends are joining. Personally I am going to level a new character. Mainly because of three reason, first I am making a character I’ve never played, Mesmer, and just seeing what it does. Secondly, I’m only playing that character when they’re on so I won’t lose out on anything on my main(s). And last I think it’d be fun to level together and experience things together. 
---
But that’s just me! Do whatever the F you and, most importantly, your wife want to do!
---
G2A resells keys. Goldsellers use stolen credit cards to buy keys and sell them to places like G2A. If you get one of those keys your account will be permanently banned. Don't do it. It's absolutely not worth the risk.
---
He is so wise.
---
Noooo.. no no no no nooooooooooooooooooo
---
Depends on your choices. I think the cutscenes are actually cool if you play as a Charr. They've got so much personality in their movements, especially their faces. I hated the cutscenes as Sylvari.   
---
Death of the mentor: cool if you picked Vigil. Forgal was tired of all that shit to begin with, had lost everything and killed himself for his last chance to become a hero. In comparison, Tybalts death felt completely unnatural and out of place to me. 
---
All in all, it feels to me like they often started out with one story line in every race/order/whathaveyou, and shoehorned the remaining lines around it which end up feeling wonky.  
---
Trahearne: no issue with him. I found him to be a good plot device because the player character was not supposed to be the one and only heroest hero around, but a believable character in an MMO.
---
I hear there are technical issues with NPCs not doing their part in battles or not progressing/walking/whatever, but I only experienced that issue very rarely.   
---
On my first play through, I was inexperienced enough to not just breeze through everything. 
---
In contrast to apparently everybody else, I liked that they cut the final battle against Zhaitan. So to me, the point of that story line was, to show that with cooperation, planning and strategy the enemy is defeated before the boss fight even begins. A glorious victory in a 1 on 1 battle would've weakened the whole quest we did before.
---
Oh no, gonna play Berserker like someone suggested.
---
^ This bot is wise..be like the bot.. be wise and stay away from G2A
---
Elona is busy farming Aurora Glade.
---
Rap god
---
copying a build from metabattle or snowcrows or discretize has nothing to do with being mindless.  
---
those builds are designed in a way that they work together in a group scenario, for example reaching 100% critchance with banners and spotter in mind.  
---
the only one not adapting would be you then. adapting in gw2 comes over skill usage and maybe minor trait changes. but not in the grand picture in terms of "oh i take too much damage because i can't dodge, now i have to take more toughness and therefore do less damage".  
---
for not so experienced people there is already the groupsetup with chrono, druid, warrior and 2 dps, where you get carried by boons, heals and other active defenses like block sharing so you do not die or you do not have to move out of your way to dodge something (if the chrono is good at blocking for you).  
---
why would you need in such a groupsetup a tanky necro? why would you need to "adapt" in the first place if your ass is getting carried by another class?
---
And keep on holding a big pile of the EU host servers closed because they are "full" and they want to cash in on gems for moving servers so that players who did not manage to get on their servers that their friends and guilds are on have to yet move another link period.
---
Definitely make a new one. You'll be better able to relate to/predict what your wife will need as a new character and be able to direct her along if she's feeling lost.
---
I'm just imagining you being on your main asking your wife what she wants to do next and being met with wave after wave of "idk what do you want to do?"
---
You’re being unfairly harsh. Episode 4 was a solid release with tons of rewards, a great map, and shiny new armor sets. Two episodes also released a fresh new mount.
---
We had to wait for months after HoT for LS3. A few weeksafter PoF we had halloween and then LS4E1.
---
They had a holo eye of zhaitan from personal story AFAIK
---
Dunno about vine tooth.
---
Rest are from 2013 dragon bash.
---
Bounty trains in PoF maps might be up your alley
---
You French sure are a contentious lot.
---
" An immovable object of constant damage reductions,...."  this is impossible in gw2, because there are simple machanics that will kill you if you dont move out. but If you want to play a sustainable dps class, go for warrior,guardian or necro.   these 3 classes have massive selfheal with just a few little adjustments while keeping a decent dps
---
First statement shows you didn't understand my intention in my post. My bad. Will try to be more specific just for you in the future. Second statement is proven by some really funny comments here. What you take away from all of this is your thing. Good luck.
---
Incorporate a raid tutorial in the story and add a low level raid . Something to introduce new players to raids. As for high level raids Anet needs to listen to community responses . Maybe introduce another level of difficulty for experienced high level players that's worth the time and energy. I personally can't tell you how many people like myself who have never even raided and Ive been here 6yrs.
---
Wrong, I crafted 250 crystaline ores and I'm exchanging them. It's just 5 per day but there you go.
---
Same, luckily enough I “only” made 97. 5 days to go.
---
I'm don't really intend to put survivability stats on existing DPS builds. Just wanna pick existing DPS build that has the most survivability by itself out of all the others.
---
I think 3 groups will just form every evening. A german lead, a french lead and an english lead
---
Honestly, PoF was pretty meh and it was lacking any critical expansion features like a new class or race (while you might say that the retroactive PC VA and armor sets is an issue, I'm sure Anet could have done it if they had a small team of 10-20 working on a new race for 2+ years straight. They just don't want to commit on it as they lack the direction they need). In addition, the metas were legitimately awful and are really lame and easy (with the exception of SI, of course). 
---
The expac launch storyline was fun in terms of gameplay and set pieces (The domain of the lost is a stand-out) but lacked any real consequences for the plot as a whole and was basically a glorified teaser for LW4 at the end of the day. Saving the actual world-shaking events and the death of the two remaining villains for LW4 was a bad idea.
---
As for LW4, it suffered heavily from the reduced budget and manpower that Anet gave it as it was very clear that plenty of shortcuts had to taken (Final Kralk fight reuses a raid boss fight's skeleton, Thunderhead lacked non-meta events, the glitch-fests of Sandswept and Kourna). I wonder how much better and faster LW4 could have been if Anet hadn't lied to their player-base that the game was receiving the utmost support.
---
So how should the next story arc after the Elona, Maguuma, and Orr story arcs should go? It needs to have a much better set-up with less of an around the world trip that ends with "we're going to X place in expac 3"! Going all around Tyria is fine if we know what the direction of the storyline is. So, if we're going to Cantha in expac 3, it should be heavily hinted by the halfway point. Finally, the Elder Dragon storyline needs to drawn to a decisive close in the next expansion. It's a boring "kill all 6 baddies" plot, and there can be more interesting low-key plots in the game.
---
short answer: no
---
long answer: nooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
I multi class in fractals and these three classes are pretty hard to kill: condi Soulbeast, condi Scourge and Core Guard. 
---
They may be non meta, but atm you say you're looking for survivability so you can learn. 
---
**Condi Soulbeast**
---
Pro: Easy rotation, great sustain. There's a lower dps but easier to play double shortbow variant too. Can bring spirits when party is lacking druid. 
---
Con: Slow ramp up damage. Pretty much needs expensive full stat infusion to do decent burst damage. Not very effective in Recs and in groups with amazing power dps players. 
---
**Condi Scourge**
---
Pro: *Boon corrupt*. Easy rotation, very tanky with Vitality runes and barriers. Superb cleave damage because of Epidemic. Faster ramp up damage and better burst compared to condi Soulbeast. 
---
Con: Epidemic will not be very effective if all other dps in the party are power dps. Might have trouble generating life force in single target battles. 
---
**Core Guard**
---
Pro: Simpler rotation and better survivability compared to DH. More versatile in a defensive support way. On demand Blind, Stability, Retaliation and lots of condi cleansing. Party quickness elite skill. F button Virtues are instant cast, have wider range and lower cd compared to DH. Cheapest among the three classes to gear as it only uses zerk stats. 
---
Con: An ok class. Difficult min max playstyle (need to perma keep Aegis up). When played normally DPS, especially burst damage is much lower than DH. I did 60k+ burst damage on DH before, Core Guard can only dream of such numbers. 
---
Out of these three I recommend picking Scourge. This is because Scourge brings unique Boon Corrupt, an ability only available to select classes. It's very handy for fractals with No Pain No Gain instability or in fractals where bosses shits boons like in Twilight Oasis and Siren Reef. As an added bonus Scourge is a ranged attacker with barrier panic button so you'll be much safer than playing melee. 
---
Core Guard is actually a decent choice as well. Use it as a stepping stone to learn the class as well as T4 encounters. Once you get more confident you can convert core guard to DH. When playing recs you can respect as power Quickbrand to give almost perma quickness to party due to short fights. If there's one thing T4 players love, it's speed running :)
---
I still need  32 days 😭
---
In all seriousness? There were probably just too many enemy types. More enemy types makes fights increasingly harder to keep track of (watching out for CC or other dangerous attacks) without really adding to the fun of mowing through goons. Medium cost, very low payoff, no reason to clutter up the spawns.
---
The domination build from here https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/ except I use Mirror Images instead of Well of Calamity (allows me to stay in GS) and Improved Alacrity instead of Danger Time. Just yesterday after making my comment I threw away the idea of ever using Danger Time and switched to full Assassin's gear except Berserker's helmet and I've improved my DPS quite a bit. I'm able to get it up to 9k now, and I've even reached 13k during a meta-event today (don't know exactly how single-target that was though). I think crit chance was my problem. I'm still working to get it up as I get ascended trinkets.
---
Also worth noting that it's only Ranged Deimos strat you would theoretically need to avoid; the melee Deimos strat is higher dps and better for faster runs, but less safe so it's less common in pugs, so you wouldn't necessarily _have to_ avoid deimos
---
I didn't think I could run Illusions with GS. Thanks, I'll check it out!
---
Art request from my friend. Had some fun with dynamic poses and coloring. Done with tablet.
---
Yeah, domi is the GS traitline and all that, but dueling sword phantasm is so strong, and illusions is a must for solo play.
---
&gt; I've just seen and read enough on both psychology of art and advertising
---

---
&gt; to distinguish what creates a logical harmony in human brain from what generates the strongest impulses in human receptors.
---
We are possibly centuries away from being able to write down this question in a way that makes sense, let alone be able to find a meaningful answer to it. You have certainly not discovered how to distinguish between two things that you don't understand, because nobody does.
---
Champ trains were replaced by world boss chains and meta chains. There's still a train, it's just not in one zone. You need a timer site like the event timer on the wiki or http://gw2timer.com which is my personal favorite. You also need to learn to use the LFG tool to taxi to a map where the activity is active.
---
Is THAT what happened! I was trying to finish it quick on my day off but I stopped getting credit for stampedes. I guess I'll just do it this weekend.
---
Play Alacrigade (Renegade that focuses on providing the Alacrity boon).  [Here's the Discretize build](https://discretize.eu/builds/revenant/hybrid-renegade).  If you run with Legendary Dwarf stance as your second legend, you get tons of defense, with both elites granting significant survivability, (either in the form of 50% DR for you and your party, or significant life leech) a trait that makes your legendary renegade skills give protection to you and your party, life leech when attacking foes, defensive/healing options from staff skills, and significantly reduced damage from conditions when you have high stacks of Kalla's Fervor.  All while doing decent dps!  You're not going to be invulnerable, and true face-tanking is out of the question, but you grant significant survivability to both you, and the rest of your party, while still contributing your fair share in the dps department.
---
Never trust that website.
---
UhhhYOU THERE. You look useful.
---
Imo dungeons were never hard *to complete*, as shown by the huge portion of the player base that interacts and has interacted with that game mode, while they are very hard to speed clear. Raids have an actual entry barrier that cuts a significant portion of the community (those that aren’t willing to put in the effort or don’t have time) out of them. Neither is better or worse, just different. Overall, I would say raids appeal more to the idea of epic endgame boss content, while dungeons do a better job providing something to do for both casual players and veterans who want to speedclear. That being said, I think fractals do an even better job of that, which is why fractals have eclipsed dungeons as the 5man endgame content. I don’t do a whole lot of dungeons, so would you mind telling me your point of view on the differences between dungeons and fractals? Genuinely interested
---
I ended up using an old level 80 character that didn’t have map completion yet.  That way I’d still get decent rewards but also get to play with her.  For me, it can feel like I’m wasting time if I’m not progressing, even if I’m playing with someone, which would make it less enjoyable for us both.
---
I did promise her no mounts or gliding, though.  No fun when your guide just flies ahead and you never see them.
---
Wow. This is actually the best art I've seen either here or on r/FFXIV in quite a while- except for that one picture of Estinien, but that was official art so it doesn't count.
---
I feel like I'm in the minority, at least on this subreddit, in that I like PoF way better than HoT in basically every aspect.  I prefer the PoF maps, both in terms of visuals (Tarir is incredible, but I'm otherwise pretty unimpressed with HoT, visually) and functionally (I know HoT's whole thing was being a tangled jungle, but I'm kinda over how frustrating it can often be to just explore).  I like its armor and weapon sets better, I think it has better collections, a better story, and more personality.  I like the elite specs from PoF more too.
---
LS4 vs LS3 is a bit closer, but I still prefer LS4 overall.  I enjoyed the story more, and going back to the LS3 maps with mounts makes them feel so much smaller.  Draconis Mons remains my favorite Living Story map from a visual perspective, but the latter half of LS4 has been really cool too, and I like all the LS4 maps better than Bloodstone Fen, Lake Doric, and Ember Bay.  We also got way more "stuff" with LS4.  We had two episodes that introduced mounts, with multiple masteries, we got two new weapon sets, two new armor sets, Suns Refuge, and a smattering of individual pieces.  LS3 on the other hand, we got one new full weapons set, no armor, and some limited masteries.  I think it had a few more individual weapon/armor pieces than LS4, and more backpieces, but that's it.
---
The recent patch that went through and made a bunch of changes to the PoF metas just further cements how much more I prefer the content in that expansion versus what we have with HoT.  I don't hate HoT (not anymore, anyways) but I just generally prefer all that came with PoF.
---
A dragon has made it to the water
---
I'm guessing time constraints. Excluding the boss mobs, the holographic dragon minions are 100% exact copies from 2013. In all honesty, Dragon Bash was probably a rush job established to be done after the layoffs, or otherwise done by a small group who didn't have time to get everything done. The decorations, set up for the arena system, the bosses, and the stampede probably took up most of their time.
---
Fuck me that is just beautiful to watch. I really really miss it now.
---
I'm almost at 7 and I have three non-accessory pieces on my main. Currently I'm slogging through crafting with all the daily gated materials. Sometimes I'll buy deldrimor steel or elonian leather if I'm close to finishing a piece, but I like my gold better in other sinks.
---
If uou dont have a lvl 47-53 one you should make one and stop playing when you are at that range and transition back to your 80. Yhen you have a mid lvl bag opener/salvager account.
---
HoT is better than PoF. Season 4 is better than season 3.
---
My record for 50/50+GWAMM was 452 hours, but some ppl do in less time, helps a lot if you have a friend that could send you some money in gw1 otherwise you will have a lot of farm to do.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
**As i read somewhere once; Do not play Gw1 because you want something in gw2, play it because it is a pretty damn good game.**
---
 and thats the truth, dont try rush it, take your time you will get there, enjoy the game withou thinking about how much time will take to reach all 50/50+Gwamm, cause if you set a time on that you will probably get burned out.

Using a level 80 character has the advantage that she can play on her own without leaving you behind. With two new characters, they are kind of bound to each other, where each person feels like they can’t play without the other one.
---
Maybe restrict yourself to core classes only though.
---
Yeha LB Ranger is really really boring especially for levelling. Def stick with GS for now.

I only ever use LB in PvP. Wait til you get access to daggers at 80, I find it really fun!

That's pretty good advice, I always forget about that!

---
In t4 fractals, most boss attacks are one- or two- shots to basically all but full-on defensive builds that do literally no damage. It’s balanced around evading or negating those attacks, not facetanking them. 
---
That’s also why t3 fractals are so hard to pug. The damage levels are ramping up, so mechanics cannot be ignored anymore.
---
There actually is some pretty cool ambient dialogue about it in the fractal area. Two lionguards talk about it.
---
Lion's Arch contains zero lions (these days).
---
Exactly
---
Play with Berserker Stats and you're good to go. Reaper is already very tanky and you will have a hard time dying at all, also the rotation is easy and you will have good damage. Probaly the best classes to start getting into T4s.
---
I can only do 1:06:280 :( Pretty well done!
---
Wait until you find the lobster.
---
Just wait until he finds the lobster.
---
&gt;Dragon Bash was probably a rush job established to be done after the layoffs, or otherwise done by a small group who didn't have time to get everything done.
---
They did a lot of new voice acting for it so it doesn't seem like a tiny size project of just a few devs.
---
That's exactly the backstory I use for all my characters. I use the same base look for all of them, and my first character was mesmer, so I just assume that all the other characters are her pretending to be different roles. Chronomancer makes it even better, they're all the same character from different timelines.
---
There isn't really one that does both a ton of damage and that is highly survivable, though.  Reaper is close, but it also lacks the thing everyone else in fractals is looking for; burst damage.  There's condi Firebrand or power Firebrand.  Condi has slightly worse burst than power there, however both utilize many active defenses with aegis and provide quickness while having a rather easy rotation.

Sorry if this a dumb question, but could you please clarify where quickness and might come from (when playing solo)? Phantasmal Fury give 10s of fury, but Phantasmal Haste is only 3s, so it should be over when phantasm becomes a clone, am I wrong? and I don't see how phantasms can get might by themselves.

Struggles with an enemy? Here, have some clones to help you out. Running the risk to become overwhelmed? Here, let me knock a bunch of them back and snipe one or two of them.
---
It's not rocket science to not use my mounts or roflstomp everything.
---
I'll bring the popcorn.
---
Yeah came here to say this, also I have 3k hours in this game and never noticed :/
---
That's a Pinata, they're made to be beaten. I see no Choya here...
---
See that squid over there?
---
You can climb it.
---
Any. Its called dodging. The build closest to what you want would be dh, blocks and whatnot.
---
The crafting plaza is a starfish.
---
damn, I never noticed that because half the time LA doesn't even load for me and I'm just walking on nothing
---
It's also a whole lot less likely for the entire sucker to burn down at once.
---
They were planning to release other games (likely including the mobile one) instead while having GW2 on auto-pilot, but then their plans were suddenly changed by the tops. Can't really bundle a season as an expansion on short notice, can you.
---
Also, we don't even know if there will be anything past season LS5. Or, maybe their data showed that paid expansions had some negative effect on the amount of active players, and they'll instead better of with more new mounts tied to heavy gemstore monetization.
---
New feature: Armor and outfits are disabled during this expansion to experience the best moments of Faren (which were in HoT).
---
it just takes practice but you did pretty good i think =)
---
99% of LfG pugs are speaking english as well
---
100g/h is unreasonable high. This WILL destroy an ingame economy after even short periods of time. Stuff like this cannot exist in a game. The fix for this was more than reasonable
---
Intel said they would cut down their prices of 12-25% [Which means they don't have a backup plan that can rival Ryzen in terms of cost and efficiency.]
---
Yeah instead of playing the events we just... stood there (even all night 100% afk).
---
I much prefer the gw2 holiday structure.
---
I rather have an expansion that took it times and it good than a expansion that was rushed just to bring out an expansion
---
I don't use the normal drift button that most people do because I didn't know about it when I taught myself to drift. To do it  I don't drive with the "W" key, but rather keep my forward momentum 100% of the time with the right and left mouse buttons held down. The key trick that I use is when I reach the turn, a little bit before it, I press S and D (brake and right), and while still holding the mouse buttons, i swing my camera around to lock in the drift. Once I know the drift is started, I start pumping the S and D key together to prevent a spinout, but maintain the drift in the direction I want to go (A and S keys for left turn of course).  
---
The hardest part is learning the timing for rotating the camera around you but that's about it =)
---
i guess you could, but there is a version of the game specific for china with less skulls n shit to get conform with their laws.  
---
so i do not know the situation over in china and how it is when playing something that is illegal and how fast you would get in trouble (since china is kind of a surveillance state), but i would informt myself over this first.
---
Check out the East side of the city. There are living areas made up of hulls still.

Can't just say LA like that
---
Is this the anime-avatar argument in a different format?
---
My brain automatically read that abbreviation as the same for always sunny in Philadelphia.
---
I was utterly confused for a moment.
---
I see! I didn't play gw1 so that's why I didnt understand the reference. Sure looks like an interesting (afk) event!
---
I personally don't need it as thief has been my main for years, but videos like these are great ideas.
---
Thanks for making it so others can enjoy!
---
Sorry for replying so late. Thing is, I've been playing this game since release and naturally someday you'll get tired of the same content. I've done everything in the game. Well, I didn't achieve everything in the game but I am not an achievement hunter, I played for the fun. Another reason why I lost my fun in the game is because a lot of my friends stopped playing.  Because of raids that is. My guild just fell apart because some people wanted to do raids as their main content and other's (including me) didn't. Raids are fun and all but I don't have the time and motivation to do them weekly.   
---
Lately I had some fun playing the dragon bash festival. I always come back to this game when there's new content but I realized that I invest less time than I did in the last years. Someday I'll stop playing this game completely. That's just how it is.
---
Surely if they become "worth" to open, people will open em, meaning supplies run lower and the price runs higher again?
---
Share away! Kitty created the video so that people would become more aware of their CCs as currently so many don't seem to have a clue about them (as the game itself doesn't teach about them) and thus many peoples seeing it might be helpful in general. And she's planning on creating similar vid of every class.
---
Wow, so much Pof hate in that thread!  
---
Hot and Pof have different purpose, and are different. Some people are disappointed because they expected PoF to be kind of a HoT reskinned into the desert, whereas it is obvious that the second extension has been though in opposition to HoT, to fill the holes HoT hasn't been trying to fill, to do something different. (Let's remember how unpopular Hot map system was back then. The community was always heterogeneous about these stuff)  
---
Storywise and worldbuilding wise, PoF is amazing. The amount of work, to make everything feel coherent, living, and natural is completely crazy. As an example among many, when Hot was trying to stay with non human civilisations, or an empty asura rata, PoF didn't try to avoid setting fully in details how Joko's empire worked, how Amnoon was compared to it, with a lot of subtleties, characters, details...  
---
I think the choice between "which was the best" entirely depends on what you expect  an expansion to be. Of course, people tend to idealize old memories and it impacts the judgement, but in my opinion, the real question, which is way more interesting than just the "hot or pof?" pit we often ends while talking of this is "what matters in the content to you?".
---
*That* soldier, is a threat!

I don't do TP flipping but if i did I would probably use this tool: [profit calculator](https://www.gw2tp.com/calculator)

How did you get up there &gt;.&gt; I couldn't get past invisible walls.
---
Took me a long time to notice that part, now I sometimes stand under it and watch the fish :)
---
congratulations! \*clap clap clap\*
---
here is your price of nothing!
---
I don't disagree with your comments but I do think the sword picking by necro is due to Trahearne, not Marjory... he'd always used it. And his has been a GS since forever.
---
I was utterly hopeful for a moment.
---
Fuck.... I never knew what the hell that charr was referring to...
---
Does the Aetherized Warhorn make a trumpety sound when used, and if not who's with me in petitioning Anet to make that a thing?
---
yes but only the dx12 dll

---
Actually running around Rata Sum with the mounts is fun too. The layers are large enough for speed, and the different levels adds a whole new layer to the fun (pun intended).
---
gz you are oblivious
---
Man imagen reading so much that you think a subjective prefrence is inferior to you lmao
---
Paladin roleplayers don't have a place in instanced pve and neither do hunters. Learn a proper build.
---
&gt; They won't remove the game modes so they can still pretend that they are developing MMO and not single-player story episodes.
---
This right here. Outside of fractals and raids, nothing in PvE requires any help. The only way you know it's an Multiplayer game is PvP/WvW.
---
Kaineng did not ask for this.
---
Thief solos make me happy especially if they dont use build templates
---
Lol so amazing
---
Oh boy, did I afk a lot in GW1

The maniac's **IN THE MAILBOX!**
---
I'm no pc or game freak but are there even games out yet that properly use multicore cpu's? Does GW2 benefit from having multicore? Almost everyone kept telling me over the past year that raw single core cpu power is the only thing that matters and is the thing you want from your cpu for gaming.
---
Right, I had forgotten about that, not the best example then, lol. Chronomancer illustrates my point better, mesmers just find a shield in the jungle and they suddenly start controlling time
---
If you start a new character, you'll know exactly what she unlocks and when.
---
So, for instance, when you unlock the ability to use utility skills, you can say "alright we have a new skill type to equip" and you can show her how to unlock and equip them by doing so first yourself.
---
If you're on a US server, hit me up in game on Vayne.8563. I help a lot of people learn the game.
---
Bruh... The lights are eyes
---
No, sulfur is breathtaking!
---
I always upvote map breakout posts.
---
Thanks for the quick reply. What about all the crafting materials and stuff? Are they salvageable too? Shouldn't I keep them for crafting?
---
Noone has to cater to you and lower their damage. Just go ahead and open doors by yourself, people very much entitled to tell everyone else to not run ahead or only autoattack
---
Thank you for the offer :) but I'm playing on an EU server. I'm afraid my ping will be too high.
---
They are not salvagable and go into your material storage  which is another tab in your bank; you can deposit them on the fly via an option in the gear icon in your inventory window.
---
as gk_asn said, salvage any gear you wont be wearing. Generally the crafting materials are worth more than the common to rare gear pieces and you can store a stack of 250 in your bank simply by right clicking the crafting materials and depositing them. Even at level 80 i salvage anything but a few spesific exotic weapons that are worth a lot of gold due to being precursors or wanted weapon skins. 
---
What comes to skillpoints, dont worry about it just max what ever you find interesting as you get points. Youll get many skillpoints by completing hero story and by 80 youll probably be able to take every trait and hero skill that's in core game.
---
ingame: /wiki itemname or [itemping] or questname or whatever there is in the game  
---
brings you instantly to the wiki page for more information.  
---
in general on vendor -&gt; sell junk, junk gone.  
---
for most part of the items you might want to grab a salvage kit from vendors and then just rightlick -&gt; salvage all x.  
---
greens and blues are mostly not needed, but their materials can be worth more.  
---
top right click on the cog and "deposit all"...then all those salvaged items go into the mat storage, so you can sell or use them later.  
---
for leveling, stay with your gear within range of your level. for example, get level 29 gear, play till level 36 and then get new gear for level 36. either use the gear you drop or if you didn't get anything, use the TP, but go for the cheapest stuff you find (uneven levels are often cheaper then for example level 30, 40, 50 gear). so even if you are level 30, sometimes its just more cost effective ro get that level 28 or 29 gear and it doesn't make a huge difference.  
---
also with gear: get the power gear, then power and precision. later with ferocity as last stat. it doesn't make any sense to go anywhere defensive, especially while leveling. the faster those mobs die, the better. also DO NOT mix and match different stats. you will loose out if you do this big time if its not within "the rules". for example it would not make sense to get assassins gear if you cap critchance already.  
---
im terms of bags: get bigger ones, you can find them on tp but since that stuff is cheap af, i bet if you ping your name here someone will send you bags to help you out. or ask in mapchat. while begging for gold or other items is not cool, people are usually cool about stuff like bags since thats really shitty not to much inventory space.  
---
crafting is not needed for now and would be a gold waste, if you go deeper into the game later you can still instant craft your shit up via guides. crafting while leveling your first toon will just drain all of your ressources into nothing.  
---
in terms of traits: i would advice you to get the power damage boosting lines first or those where you get buffs like fury / might on certain conditions since those buffs will really carry you if you can stack them like mad while leveling (and also in endgame).  
---
but in the end you can't make any mistakes. once you reach level 80, you will have enough points to get every single skill and traitline unlocked. also to swap those is always free and will cost you nothing. so just explore and play arround a bit.
---
Well you can still hit me up in game via whisper and I can answer questions. Or join up in discord or something.
---
Made in Cantha.
---
welp; now i regret not doing any dragon bash till now
---
Next time don't order over AliExpress.
---
I actually opened several characters. I've got a Thief, an Elementalist, a Revenant and a Ranger(which I like the least so I might just delete him). The races don't matter right? They're only for aesthetic and story if I recall correctly.

Underwater is breathtaking

For all intents and purposes, the Chinese version is a completely separate game.

nothing carries over from the main version to this one.

These could be commander tags!

Races are just for fashion as far as classes go.

I see. Well, thanks for the help I'll go and try to implement some of it :D

All the countrys formed the EU, but when they are  combined in a game its a desaster.

Maybe you should leave the EU if you want to be only with people from your own country..

Congrats on this :D

Btw where can I see this resume of achievement points ??

A decent list to start with is [here](https://discretize.eu/guides/consumables). There's a lot of other useful consumables, but they're not really that well documented.
---
What savings!
---
I hate it because I don't like the layout.
---
Not quite sure what you mean. Maybe that's a track that's not from tekkit but bundled with Taco and you didn't disable *that*?
---
How is it possible nowadays to do the achievement "Honorary Crew Member" in doric lake, it seems impossible without a zerg, we tried it many times with 5 people, but they are just too many of them and you need like cc from 3 people alone to stun one of them..
---
There is this list on [wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Purchasable_bundles) which should list all the the bundles you can buy from vendors. It might be a bit outdated, but i don't think anything usefull for dungeons is added with the expansions or living story patches.
---
The aetherblades were recruited from pirates and ex-pirates, some of them from LA. They even have a secret HQ in LA.
---
It only made sense for the Council to want to distance themselves even more from their pirate past after that.
---
Regarding weapons: almost all classes allow you to have two weapon sets. I find it very useful to have a melee weapon and a ranged weapon. For instance, some enemies have skills or effects that mean projectiles do more or less damage. Or sometimes you need to avoid environmental hazards, like clouds of poisonous gas.
---
As to which weapons you use with which  profession, play around with them. If you get a weapon drop that you can equip but have never tried with that toon, give it a go. A staff's skills, for instance, will be different for an ele and a necro. You may love it for one profession but find the same weapon vastly annoying on another! If you hate it, sell or salvage it and try something else.
---
Also, just because "everyone" says you "should" use a certain weapon for your toon doesn't mean you have to.* Use what works for you! If you love a certain weapon combo, learn to make the best use of it. Do some research and buy a good weapon. Remember, it's your game, and it's supposed to be fun!
---
I played GW from its first month of release, and GW2 since beta. I use some weapon combos that people consider only fit for noobs. But I enjoy them, so I play them, and I can hold my own in most situations.
---
*If you get serious about PvP, WvW, fractals, dungeons, or raids later, that's different. You may need certain builds (armor, weapon, and skill combinations) to be survivable and get into a good group. You can also do most of those things casually with a combination of exotic and ascended gear. Raids, maybe not.
---
The only thing you need to slot as warrior for succes in pvp is rampage. the double arc divider combo had some potential but it's already nerfed to the point it no longer oneshots the low hp classes in pvp. sometimes it's already hard to survive as spellbreaker with shield and full counter, you will just get focussed and die in seconds. you don't have the luxury of full maurader stats + durability, neither do you have a melee blob filled with guardians to keep you alive.
---
The Lion Statue was moved to the mists-connected area, over the Fractal portal.

I'm disappointed to look and see this thread has only 68% upvoted, where this video showcases actually skillful gameplay and then there's a picture of a fucking bird that says "Bran" with 1.4k upvotes. The state of this subreddit is pathetic tbh.
---
The original arch in lion's arch was a very weirdly shaped keep.
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/images/c/c7/Lion%27s_Arch_Keep_tower.jpg
---
This model was rather tiny, but it was meant to represent a huge tower with a massive arch behind it, all of it made out of a lot of different structures cobbled together into a massive castle. 
---
All of that was destroyed when the waters rose and massive tsunamis washed over LA.
---
Yeah even with that ele thread it's just not really garnering attention nearly at the level it should. Pretty much anything I've ever seen posted on this subreddit showcasing proper gameplay seems to get like 1/10th of the attention that low effort posts and "Just made my first legendary after 6 years of barely playing :)" posts do, you know?

The bank building is an octopus, not a squid.

---
Tfw you have more daily/monthly points than I have in total.
---
Congrats, though! What an achievement :O
---
I agree with that. It's worth playing just for fun, experiencing the lore, and then you can decide from there
---
If you go to your hero panel (H) and look at your skills in the build panel, you can look at what each weapon's skills are for your class. Based on your comment, you are either a Warrior or a Ranger as they can equip the most weapon types. Take a look at them and see which ones seem appealing to you. These will change depending on your class. For example, Greatsword is a powerful melee weapon for Ranger offering several strong hits of flat damage as well as a skill that lets you close the distance to your target, a block to avoid damage, and a bash that dazes/CC's your target. However, on a Mesmer, the weapon becomes a ranged weapon with a beam attack! So make a habit of looking through your skills if you are trying out a new character.
---
Crafting is useful, particularly in getting a lot of skins. My advice is to check out [gw2crafts.net](https://gw2crafts.net) and find the most efficient/cheapest ways to get whatever crafting skill you have up to 400/500 depending on what you choose. You can have two disciplines to start on each character at the start and you can pay money to get additional disciplines on each character. BUT you can max them ALL out on a single character, although you have to pay gold to swap between them. In the end, I just maxed two out on one character, and used two other characters to level up the other 4 disciplines (and ignored scribe because fuck scribe). ALL of this is stuff you can do now or later. Since you're just starting out, if you max this stuff out you're likely to get a lot of crap you can't use. So a smart thing might be to level up the disciplines up to where you can use the gear you're making and nothing further. Then when you get to a higher level, you can level up that discipline more, etc.
---
Since you're just starting out, I would just deposit all your materials into material storage (gear icon in your inventory and then click deposit all). Those gemstones will be useful in leveling up your Jewelcraft in time. Once you're at max crafting in all disciplines, you'll get a general idea of what materials are actually useful for you, depending on your goals.
---
You are playing a nice range of classes with a good spread of possibilities for "meta" (aka optimal) playstyles at endgame (level 80) with their elite specs. Thief is really the only pure DPS class you have, the rest can do a lot of different things. Revenant can be pure DPS, support with boons, or give out alacrity to make skills recharge faster. Ranger can be a DPS, focus on damage over time, or can be a solid healer with boon support. Elementalist can also do flat DPS, DoT, or healing. All this is long in the future since you're only 15-20, but it's something to keep in mind. In the end, I would make sure you have one of each class, as all of them are useful and you never know what new elite specs might change about an existing class.
---
It is unlocked in the wardrobe and they are account bound. Why do you want to craft more?
---
Can you explain how? They don't get to keep the mounts, on map transition they're dismounted, and dismounted if the loaner decides to take it back.
---
Because I can only get one weapon skin and not all? (:
---
But now you can do much crazier map breaks with them
---
Does that mean I... shouldn't upvote this?
---
In the past, exploring maps, getting to a vista was challenging that could involve mini-jp, it maybe frustrating but sometimes rewarding when u finally reached the spot and made you appreciate the design
---
Now, skyscale breaks all barrier, takes u almost anywhere with minimal effort, even without switching mount at all, it is very convenient, but sometimes too convenient that most ppl forgot to stop and take a look at the scenery around them.
---
Give her butter, she'll give you a boon :D
---
Nah you are gonna faceroll content and it's not gonna be fun for her whatsoever having all skills and traits unlocked makes a difference 
---
Start a new one imo
---
Skyrim intensifies
---
I had no idea of the amount of min-maxing until I realized you following the broad boards of the Trade Commons to minimize speed loss.
---
You put more effort into that race than I put into my life.
---
It's normal for the icons to show up on the big map if that's what you mean.
---
46. How many do I actually play? 3, and sometimes a 4th in WvW.
---
Hitting 80 becomes trivial and you're only limited by character slots.

---
Without mounts, HoT is awfully hard.
---
I have 6: my main Guardian (currently specced as Quickbrand), a Revenant (currently an Alacrigade), an Elementalist (Weaver), a Necro (Core, but building to Reaper), an Engineer (Scapper, but in the midst of respeccing to Holo), and a Mesmer (Mirage).  I also have a level 50 warrior as a bag opener, and a level 60 thief that I don't really enjoy playing. 
---
Guardian takes up far and away the most of my play time.  Originally I split between the engie and ele for my main alts, but my Revenant has recently usurped them as my primary alt.
---
It doesn't help that guardian shares the lowest base vitality with elementalist and thief at around 11k HP, there is an honor grandmaster trait called "force of will" that will you an added boost of 300 vitality (3000 hp).  If you want a stat that has a good amount of a trade off between damage and sustain, I'd recommend **Marauder's** (Power, Precision, Ferocity, Vitality) or **Valkyrie's** (Power, Ferocity, Vitality). For full tank stats that synergize with Firebrand boon output I'd recommend **Minstrel's** (Toughness, Healing Power, Vitality, Concentration).
---
1 Vitality = 10 HP, Toughness gets added to the total defense stats of your gear (the total is your "Armor" stat) and is used as a divisor when all the power and damage modifiers of the enemy hitting you are added up (weapon damage, power, other modifiers, etc.) You can find the exact formula for damage calculation [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Damage).  
---
While vitality and toughness usually go hand in hand when you're building tanky, when you're trying to find a sweet spot between not dying and dealing a bunch of damage you'll want to focus more on vitality as toughness doesn't really give good dividends unless you have an assload of it.  Extra vitality will help you soak some extra hits without losing 90% of your HP.
---
When you come up with a build, always keep your end goal in mind, ie. "I want to do more damage" or "I need at least 20% more HP" So you can look for ways to accomplish these goals by looking at what combination of armor, trinkets, traits or runes/sigils will most efficiently fill your requirements and, at best, also allow for extra damage or sustain than another build that would also otherwise meet your sustain or damage quota.
---
One of each class. I leveled about 6-7 of them using tomes and lvl boosts from my birthday reward chests
---
It's not important at all. You dodged a bullet.
---
I personally avoid full rep guilds because 99% of them are some retarded snowflakes that you dont need in your life.
---
He didn't tilt his head though.
---
27.
---
Woah what?  Changes everything
---
It's a stingray
---
Just avoid wvw in EU right now if you do go, ‘tis a silly place
---
What do those awful choyas have against vases?
---
QQ
---
Oh ok. Yikes, I thought I Bm'ed the guild hard.
---
Thanks for clarifying.
---
I miss being new in GW2....the months after launch were so exciting. I remember having sucha  hard rive to play the game
---
Race skills are absolutely trash and never used
---
Just a heads up: says "Available for 6 days only!" right now; so definitely not 3 weeks.
---
There are specific times when it is required to get credit like during guild missions, so you would do it if you're participating.  There are times when maybe you'd do it for a sense of community or something like if your guild organizes normal events in the world or if you run together in WvW or PvP.
---
Any time else?  Entirely up to you.  You can chat with all your guilds by setting up your chatbox to show them.
---
Bigger guilds often have benefits for members due to their guild hall upgrades.  I'm not sure if you have to rep to get these?  But they may be worth it for you to decide who to rep during your "normal" play.
---
Did you throw the ring in or did it poses your soul as well?
---
One Acount with 30 lvl 80 and one account with 3 lvl 80
---
Honestly all of the gaming subreddits I've been a part of either didn't have this issue at all or had it to a far lesser extent, this game is just... I dunno. Different. 1% of the playerbase cares about gameplay nowadays.
---
So, what probably happened was that you had 19 of the food on your inventory, then clicked on it to add to the collection and they all got account bound. Support will definitely help you, just wait for a response on a ticket.
---
&gt; "There! Up there is the altar!" Or "Up the slope! We need to reach the altar!" she won't finish her walk and the path hard bugs.
---
Fucking hell so *that* is why. It's when someone triggers some of her previous dialogue from being too far behind that causes it. For the longest time I've been thinking that it was someone triggering past the spot she begins her slow walk before she says "up the slope!" but recently I had her bug even after I waited for that like of text before running in. It makes sense now.
---
Do pistol and rifle have unique sounds?
---
So, casual clothings for gw2 when?
---
I broke out of Dtagonstand and towards the north east, South of the hidden beach, there was a weird building that looked really incomplete but along the way there were red oozes and an updraft with some mushrooms for boosts. I still don't know if that was something that was meant to be a jp or not because I died trying to get up out into the open sky above and haven't been able to find my way back out of the map on the north end to find it since.
---
Every class fits any race somehow, except if you make a Charr Mesmer, that's one of the ugliest thing i've ever witnessed lol
---
Try condo scourge.
---
You can heal yourself from condi damage you deal, can solo most bosses.
---
To some people.
---
I have 22 characters atm and 11 are at 80! 
---
Only 5 of them have been leveled through playing, though. Most get leveled through tomes from wvw. 
---
I hate switching builds and having multiple armor sets in my inventory, so I'm working on a character for each elite spec. I also spend most of my time on fashion wars, so I have a lot of duplicate classes on different races and genders.
---
oh yeah...the second i realized those boards didn't cause me to launch up multiple times, my time trials really started to improve. The other major trick for maintaining speed is an itty bitty hop up to the first mound right before the hairpin
---
The asura-sized answer is "it depends". The more norn-sized answer is that while there's absolutely no Word of God (i.e., ArenaNet) requirement that "yes, you're playing Guild Wars 2, you must represent a guild at *all times*!", certain guilds will require you represent more than others. Said guilds should usually make it pretty clear in their rules what their representation requirement is. My main guild, for example, does *not* require that you ever represent, but that if you *do* represent, it must be on Asura. That may seem weird, harsh, whatever, but: 1.) You're allowed to talk in guild chat while not on an asura; you just can't represent, and 2.) That's *very* clearly explained as the nature of the guild when you join. If you dislike it, the guild's not for you. I represent my guild because they're awesome mousepeople.
---
I'd echo what some others have said, in that mechanically, the only two times you really *need* to represent a guild are during that guild's guild missions (you won't get credit if you don't rep) and when accessing the guild's guild hall services (they'll just ignore you if you aren't a repping member of the guild).
---
lol thank you...would have been fun...nothing like a little friendly competition =)
---
When my gorseval squad has problems with immobilize i like to bring the sylvari skill that does that when playing scourge instead of the minion.
---
You could've just waited 7 years for the skyscale to release and save yourselves the effort, lul.
---
10. One each plus a mirage.
---
5 out of my 6 slots are 80.  But I really don't play them much at all, other than my main.  They just got leveled over the years by all the free exp scrolls and stuff.
---
Don't know
---
Do you have logs for condi soulbeast runs? Just curious
---
Good question, and ultimately it's up to you, but I'd strongly suggest making a new char. Keep your old one as a reference, but now that you know *how* to level (more or less), I feel it'll be more fun to level together on your new Asura characters. 
---
With a max level char chugging along with a brand new char, you'll 1.) be constantly doing more damage than she is, and in some cases making stuff feel not challenging, and 2.) basically forcing her to take the lead in almost all story instances (since you likely won't see the story markers).
---
&gt; There's an absolute shit ton of content in PoF besides story and map completion though, even if it's not the kind of content you're looking for
---
I'm so sick of "even if it's not the kind of content you're looking for" argument. It's a fucking MMORPG, what do you think, for what kind of content I'm looking for. Is it unreasonable to think I want the game to feel like MMORPG if developers sold me it as MMORPG? 
---
&gt; The story improved a lot and the worldbuilding [...] in open world is on point.
---
Maybe its just me but decentralization of the story in MMO's is more interesting than running blindly after a super villain. Making a player character literal unkillable god is just boring. I'd rather be one of the many heroes that linked different cultures to stand against evil. Talking about villains, I'd rather have someone like illidan or arthas (or caudecus, or joko, or balthazar) than a dragon that literally doesn't interact with player up until his very end. Like who tought it was good idea to have a villain that just behave instinctively (in this case, all kralk was doing was absorbing magic) was a good idea.
---
&gt; and exploration 
---
I don't play mmo's for exploration. Your main content pillar cannot be based on single player open world content. I like exploration but I do it once and that's it. 
---
&gt; Also, what is wrong with the most recent fractals? Are they bad because we can't just rush through them in 2 minutes and be done with it?
---
What r u talking about, fractals never were about rushing through them up until PoF. Old fractals were very progressive, most of the time you had to do A do go to B to do C to unlock the boss and move further. PoF fractals you just run past most of the stuff to the boss, kill the boss, rinse and repeat. And the bosses themselves are inherently designed to frustrate players instead of interact with em. Pushing away, interrupting the rythm of the combat, putting shitton of condis on players is just not fun.
---
They invited a new person, had to explain how to even rep the guild, but didn't explain that guild rep is per character?
---
willfarrell.gif
---
Don't give it another thought, loads of great friendly guilds without that antiquated requirement.
---
Also, welcome to the game!
---
Then I'd definitely say make a new character. You having a character that is, storywise, miles away from her is not going to make her feel motivated to continue with you. Pick a race/story combo that you haven't done (as long as it's Asura, because mousechildren are best race).
---
2012 was lit.
---
9 Asura
---
10 Human
---
9 Char

9 Norm

1 Sylvari
---
That's your opinion but dont take YOUR opinion for general truth.
---
99% of them retarded ... wtf ...
---
Personnally I'm ONLY interested by full rep guild because I like to invest into a guild where other guild members are also fully invested in that guild.
---
The fact that almost everyone in this post is saying "100% rep is retarded" make me feel like it's time to leave this game and its "awesome" community.
---
Yes, they did it on purpose and announced it loud and clear.
---
Why in the world you spend gems on a transfer knowing it was coming?
---
And then bitch about it? Quit spending money on this game and they'll get it.

X/WH = Mightbot/Boonbot builds, usually replacing a Druid
---
Staff = Pure healing, recommended if you already have a might source like Druid
---
&gt;How important is representing a guild?
---
Short answer: Not at all.
---
Long answer: Since the removal of [Influence](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Influence) and the addition of the ability to talk in any guild chat without having to directly represent, representing guilds does nothing but make the guild appear more active to the public.
---
46? o.o
---
It doesn't work all the time. I was in a guild that asked me to leave for being too toxic as despite providing that sort of incredibly positive feedback, I mentioned in broad terms why we wiped. Repeatedly. For the same reasons. A group of raiders in the guild refused to sign for raids or discuss their issues with me, despite my reaching out, and the leadership - who I otherwise thought were lovely people - asked me to leave.
---
Mind you, those members that refused to raid also referred to a pug, who was perfectly competent, as "a fucking cunt" because they rightfully called out one of the guild members for their low dps and inability to handle Deimos oils.
---
Nice leadership that caves easily and terribly immature membership that don't actually play that well is a recipe for toxicity, no matter if you praise them for handling basic mechanics.
---
Specific gear set up  but also not over writing food. For example on warrior, you switch between condi and power all the time when you raid, popping new food over and over can get expensive
---
Wife chiming in! My husband and I have always gamed together since beta, but he plays more than I do. (Three or four  times a week together, though he often logs in for a couple of PvP matches on other days.)
---
We found we were happier when we had characters to play together that were the same level and race. We did have have characters we also played freely.
---
Now it's not an issue for us, of course, since we have more leveling boosters of various sorts than we'll ever use! We usually play to level five or ten on new toons, then boost to instant 80 when we get impatient. :D
---
Thank you for that :D!!!
---
dat wishful thinking at the end
---
Thank you, this helped allot.
---
Things that are relevant, and apply to more people, will get more upvotes. This isn't all that relevant to people. It's a solo of content that isn't supported anymore. While that is impressive, it isn't as accessible to the majority of the subreddit nor is it necessarily relevant.
---
People can walk up to the bird, see it and go "Heh, Game of Thrones". Those same people probably can't solo Arab nor are interested in it.
---
Especially bc they are so rare. And those ppl who got one put a lot of care into them, too
---
It's like a theme park
---
&gt; this is bullshit.

You accidentally put a dot instead a colon there.
---
Thank you so much!
---
I transfered months ago, before there was any news about a potential re-link. Even after the news, nowhere was anything mentioned about what servers would be linked to which other server. And i didn't bitch about it - i just bemoaned my bad timing. The only one bitching here is you and i honestly don't know why and i even more honestly don't care why.
---
So please, take your crazy little tirade elsewhere. Blocked.
---
I used to have i5-4440 and some time ago I switched to 8700k @ 4,7. It made very noticable difference in FPS.
---
&gt;The fact that almost everyone in this post is saying "100% rep is retarded" make me feel like it's time to leave this game and its "awesome" community.
---
Well, if that's all it takes to make you quit a game... Okay, bye.
---
Welcome to seaworld
---
Yeah.
---
The short of it is I used to work till 3AM, and when I got home nobody was on. So I used to complete a map or half a map a night while watching a couple episodes of Netflix to sort of destress.
---
It got to the point where I had almost one of every class/race combo (Pre-HoT), so I just did that. I do not have map completion on all 46. Most slots were bought with gold nearer to launch when it was easier.
---
Why 46 I stead of 45 then? I have two Sylvari Elementalists and they're waaaaaaay to old to delete. I need to keep my dye collection propped up!
---
15. All geared for a specific build so I don’t have to worry about swapping builds. I’m at a point in the game where I can instantly level to 80, gear out in full ascended, and unlock the elite spec I need. So if I have an idea for a build or need a specific role, I just make a new character.
---
5. My old main, a ranger, my current main, Elementalist. A thief and a mesmer i haven't really touched in years and who i only keep around because of their age and birthday gifts. And an relatively new Engineer, because i felt like completing the entire Map and going through the whole story again.
---
I do agree that Shatter Storm does not bring much - it does not reduce the cooldown or makes Mind Wrack more powerful, but only adds a bit flexibility in when you can use it. However, still not sure why you called it "a terrible mistake", as it does not look like in solo play phantasms would have enough boons for Persistence of Memory to have much impact.
---
Particularly, what is you assumption "phantasms die in about 1sec" is based on? Could not find phantasm duration anywhere on internet, and my own impression was that they stay longer (about 3sec, at least) - that may be wrong, but do you have a reference to different data (or did your own tests)?
---
Now, even with only Fury transferred, Persistence of Memory may be still better, just not sure how much - after all, that added Mind Wrack flexibility does improves the burst capability, which is arguably more important for open world than boon you'll get after you target is dead ;).
---
The only way to salvage equipment is buy that from some of the vendors correct?
---
Ahhh the good ole' days :P
---
Eh, you can't help people that can't help themselves. But props to you for still trying
---
Staff is what makes tempest great, if you're not playing staff you're just a scuffed druid, Water autos and Geyser are probably the two best healing abilities in the game and on the flipside there really is nothing great about either dagger nor warhorn abiltiies.
---
So why is this build on SC then? It does quite a bit of damage for a healer build but that's irrelevant for 99.99% of the community and only speedrunners should concern themselves with it.
---
Here's a build for staff : https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Tempest_-_Support_Healer
---
Forget the part about switching in Earth traits, if you don't need to be in water for the time being you can hit Water 4-2 -&gt; Earth -&gt; roll on ice field -&gt; activate and detonate Earth 3 and then overload earth more protection, Blasting ice fields grant frost aura and regeneration/vigor/burst healing, you can also wear half harrier half magi if you want longer boons.
---
Get a salvage kit from vendors, yes. 
---
Id advise getting 2 of them. One with a higher chance for rarer materials to use on orange and rare pieces, and one with lower chance for blue and green and white pieces. Though this only applies once you get a lill bit of a higher level, say 50+ ish. Otherwise a normal  kit with a low % will do.
---
It's an octopus 😂😂
---
Depends on the game mode and build but if you're running power or condition DPS (lynx) in PvE  you stay merged as it's a DPS loss to not be. The one PvE exception is the condition dagger/torch build with Iboga, you can damage by swapping between merged and not. The Iboga build is better on fights with lots of attacks and movement since it generates a decent amount of confusion and a little torment. Basically any place you would bring mirage. You can see [the rotation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEKreVYIj2U). Otherwise for the other builds just stay merged for maximum DPS.
---

I realllllyyyyy liked HoT. PoF I loved but not as much as HoT!
---
You can easily buy it for like 350g if you have patience. That put aside, if you want to "earn" it for yourself, all you have to do is raids that award Gaeting Crystal (that is, any encounter from wings 5, 6 or 7) and save them until you have 2k crystals. Then you can buy the throne from the W6 vendor for 2k crystals + 100g.
---
150 crytals per week, so 14 weeks + 100g if you do not get a lucky drop...and its fairly rare. so you just gotta raid.
---
The grandmaster marks are used to buy ascended armor and weapons. If you're buying them in sPvP you'll also need [ascended shards of glory](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_Shard_of_Glory) which come from doing ranked PvP. The higher your rank the faster you get the [reward chests] (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/PvP_League#Rewards) and the reward chests give better rewards higher up. In PvP you can get a limited number of markers per season from the reward chests and after that you'll need to craft them. Check https://gw2crafts.net/ for help in leveling crafting, it gives you a cheap guaranteed crafting path but will actually require less than it says especially if you use any boosters.
---
And if they did the said content well, they wouldn't need to have full rep because people would recognize them anyway.
---
Hey, one of your initial Warband is a Guardian. Don't forget poor Dinky.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
fixed :)
---
Thank you for clearing that up.
---
&gt; Pre-orders were somewhat relevant 
---
Key word: "were". They were relevant when a physical copy was presented. But now everything is digital and a company actually stands to lose money on making physical copies (losing money on materials, shipping, packaging, etc.). And with their last debacle (we all know FO76 was bullshit and the way they handled it was bullshit), what makes you think that they are going to actually make physical copies?
---
I'd say the best course of action is to abstain from any and all preordering until companies and developers can provide something concrete; not just a flashy trailer that ends on a cliffhanger and just hands out tickets to the Hype-Train. You can feel free to disagree with me on that, but the fact is that preordering has gone from getting a guaranteed physical copy to teaching the developers/companies that they can spoon-feed the buyer shit (since apparently they'll continue preordering whatever they make despite it never being completely finished or even good).
---
Ehh you also MUST rep to be recognized as guild teams for PvP or tournaments. 
---
Aside from that (I can’t think of anything else on the “mandatory”rep list).. great list!
---
The other way is to get https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Copper-Fed_Salvage-o-Matic from gemstore. You'll need to spend real money on it (as I do not think you have enough gold to convert to gems that early in the game), but IMHO added quality-of-life benefits make it worth. Do that only if you're sure that you like the game and will play for a while, of course.
---
What the hell is that thing in the back...
---
Just give it a bit 
---
Oh burn me, its a lobster

It's actually an octopus. Squid are a little different in the head
---
Rome wasn't built in a day. Not to mention, it had character and I loved how it look.
---
Funny you should mention Rome, they had great concrete.
---
Staff for situations where damage pressure is high, or when you need to heal from range. 
---
Scepter/Warhorn is preferable for most Fractal fights for Might and Fury generation. 
---
Scepter/Focus is used when either additional CC, or projectile blocks is needed. 
---
Dagger/Focus is probably your best break bar setup since you can instantly share Lightning Aura and Transmute after. 
---
Dagger/Warhorn Arcane also works for Might and Fury upkeep.
---
Way too much abuse by a lot of developers, both big and small. Also, sorry if I came across as a bit of an ass there. Just a bit of a touchy subject to me; seeing something that I used to enjoy (all these game companies) turn to ass right before my eyes.
---
I am also loving this course! I have found that the start and the first turn make the biggest impact on your time. Here is my current best of [01:02:600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIRgH6v6p6E). A guildie and myself have had ongoing competition since these races were released which really helps to drive improving our times. I've been spending most of my time doing these time trials so if you see me in Hoelbrak say hello!
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/6/6d/Plastic_Spider_Underside.jpg
---
That's two different groups though - audio and designer. Just because there's a decent amount of work from the audio team, doesn't necessarily mean there's going to be a lot of work from other teams, and vice versa (we practically got no new models, and only one concept art image seen so far, so the art team's involvement seems minimal).
---
If someone takes pride in their club they can wear in wherever.  If I join a club to do certain things with and get nothing but badgered for not wearing their shirts in MY OWN personal time (say, not repping a wvw only guild while mapping in Caledon), then y'know, maybe I should find a guild that holds itself together based on what it does rather than how it looks.
---
*Burn it, now, burn it!*
---
&gt;for some reason
---
* Tastelessness / Stupidity (very interchangable in the case of Bethesda)
---
* Ignorance
---
* Blind brand loyalty
---
These are the three things that sell bad mainstream games. People are either dumb or tasteless enough to buy games that are so shallow that the only kind of person who can enjoy them is a complete dunce, or they don't care about the problems (in Bethesda's case it's commonly "well I can just download mods to fix all the problems") or they remember enjoying Skyrim when they were a shitty fucking 13 year old kid so they want to stick to bethesda's RPGs no matter how bad they are.
---
I got my beetle and never used it until I was levelling an alt, saw a track, and thought it might be fun XP. Oh man, it's great. I wish there were more tracks to complete, I genuinely loved doing the time trials. I use the beetle for everything now, it's amazing to roll around old maps with.
---
Thank you for the answer.  I dont relaly craft but assuming I finish a ranked pvp season getting all the rewards, that should be enough for 1 piece of ascended armor right? so with my math itll take 6 seasons to get all ascendeda rmor if i dont craft?
---
Well, don't worry, those first two years it was a pile of rubble.
---
What have you wrought
---
For real, people complaining give zero craps about the design philosophy. Every single time multi-mapping is found, they kill it because it kills the economy. Maybe people would be happier if the rewards were instead tide to contribution towards the total kill count or completion of events in the fractal. "Oh, you were only in here for the boss, but not the 3 events leading up to it? Have a champ bag"
---
... especially considering t4 doesn't even give ess, only high CMs do.  People are crazy.
---
Ohgawd the mouth at the base of the neck
---
To start, warhorn is probably the only OH weapon you should use since no other weapon comes close to the boon generation it provides. Boon generation, especially in 5 man fractal play is pretty much the only way youll get a spot in any serious group...which leads to my next point.
---
Staff is kind of junky. This isnt because it is weak at healing, it probably has the highest healing output, its because healing alone doesnt really fit any current group makeup. Right now, support pretty much has to provide boons, either 25 might/fury or some mix of quickness/alacrity. If it doesnt, you need someone else to, but that person will likely either not be able to maximise DPS or they themselves will be a healer, which would be an already excessive amount of healing. So in the end, staff is a great weapon on paper, but pretty bad given that it provides too little boon generation.
---
Scepter isnt a bad choice, but I dont think its a very good heal mainhand. The only heal it provides is pretty "meh" and can easily miss if people move out of it. It ends up relying on blast finishers (not reliable in group play) and OH heal skills, which are long cooldowns. It technically provides the best boon generation due to the blasts, but again, thats not reliable due to how the combo system works.
---
IMO, dagger is the best heal tempest weapon. The heal on water 2 is super strong and you can move with it to reposition mid cast (also, water 3 is a blast you can pair with wh5 if you insist on blast being useful). Both fire and earth 3 have mobility skills. And air 3 gives you an extra CC. (I also havent mastered the rotation, but I wouldnt be surprised if dagger/wh also put up decent dps for a healer that can put up perm might/fury/prot/vigor...which isnt a small feature in fractals...though also one that likely doesnt beat out firebrigade)
---
Yes officer, this post right here
---
You need to kill Dhuum once if you want to do it that way
---
which still is the hardest raid encounter for most ppl
---
Well, you do that.  I think SW is relaxing.  Istan was only good if you blew your heart out desperately rushing for more champs that died instantly when they spawned (I've never seen a champ in GH and I'm not sure I believe they existed).  Everything else was morally dubious exploitation of something clearly not meant for how it was being used.
---
Fractals and raids still give a load of cash when done as intended.  No need to cry over a closed exploit.
---
Good point; I've only done guild PVP in a guild missions context, never a tournament, so that's new information for me!
---
You can get 3 marks per season from the [box](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Box_of_Grandmaster_Marks). Some armor pieces of armor need 4 marks (chest and legs) rest need 3 so it would take 7 seasons just for the 20 marks. If you plan to only PvP though there isn't really a point in ascended armor besides the skins so just keep that in mind since crafting is very easy (and relatively cheap) to do. Can also take a look at [this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) on other ways to get gear for PvE and WvW, it's mainly focused on exotics but it has all the best ways to get ascended gear too.
---
You also need to rep a guild if you want raid/fractal cm kill guild-hall decoration rewards. aka Kill proofs (KP) but this is pretty darn endgame stuff.
---
From Raids? Solid 10. From the TP solid 1.
---
=O but how will i know it's you?
---
By Ogden's Hammer, whAT THE FUCK IS THAT
---
Also, it must be more than the first turn, because I can lock down that turn in time trials without even losing speed and still only have that 1:05ish
---
put that thing back where it came from or so help me
---
Jesus Malchor get the fuck over her already

Just for fun.

Please be nice :P

&gt;It might be that simply people browsing the subreddit like to see other things. And in that sense, I would not call all those different tastes pathetic.

WuT, yOu MeAn tO sAy OtHeR's OpIniOns mAttERs?

i am currently in 2 social guilds with the 3rd being my own. toons i rarely use or are just for storage or farming will rep my own guild, and i rep either of the 2 social guilds depending on the last guild interaction i had. i might be repping one guild for days on end simply because i did missions with them a few days ago, then if the 2nd guild got together for a world boss i switch to repping them.
---
my last 2 guild slots are empty right now, i'm hoping to find time to join a raid/fractal/dungeon guild and do runs with them, and i will only rep those during the actual run but even then it shouldnt be necessary.
---
when i first started playing i joined a 100% rep guild, they were nice and helpful, but they complained my storage toon wasnt repping them when i was just cleaning my bank, so i quit them.
---
I say we beat Todd Howard senseless with a wrench, but your idea is good, too.
---
You don't get Raid's decoration tokens unless you represent one. :)
---
Love this, I have also spent countless hours trying to get to places I wasn't meant to be  🙃
---
Whoa, lvl 25 is still nothing. Don't level up so many heroes at the start because you will have hard time actually learning any of them or gearing at lvl 80.
---
Gw2 is action oriented game so gear and level won't change anything. You will die even in most tanky gear unless you learn how to play a class.
---
You will start to notice bigger differences once you unlock few specializations (trait trees). 
---
What to spend your points? On anything. The only advice is, to finish one line of skills/traits once you start learning it, and before starting another one. This way you will get most powerful skills and traits and not just pick few random and unfinished trees. By lvl80 you can afford everything. Or sooner if you gather hero points.
---
Also, there is no way of "breaking" you hero, or gearing wrong way. Pick weapons you like, find traits for them and hit lvl 80. Then we will talk.
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
Could be possible but I doubt they would do it. It does remind me however of how exited I was when they added all those elonan hairs and faces to the base game. I imagine the sylvari design to be a bit more demanding by comparison.
---
and then the Choya turned around and grabbed her by the throat and broke her neck before she could stab it in the stomach

Considering the amount of drama, I suspected that!

and also if you want that wp cost reduced, important one right :P

18 one for each spec.

Is this still the case in raids with the new Jangly chest system?  Since the trophies are now drops within said chests?
---
I’ve been wondering, but haven’t tried for science...
---
This is a joke, but I wish they would get into more body horror creature design. Like the Mouth of Zhaitan and things like that. Those are the fun things to go up against. I don't really care about purple-tinted humans/charr/griffons.
---
Is this still true with the new Jangly Chest Raid rewards system?
---
I haven’t tried myself, but I heard you get kp from the coffers whether yer repping or not now.
---
havent tried either but ill try in a bit, will update in like an hr
---
So help me, SO HELP ME
---
oh lol sorry about that! Akkara Axagor or Omp.2501

*chuckles*
---
Well done!

My wife face tanks everything, never dodges...always dies...
---
What’s even worse is that if you talk to her, she’s looking for transport to the Dragonbrand because she’s heard stories of the Brand and wants to see for herself the effects of Kralkatorrik...
---
We'll get plenty of body horror again when we visit the DSD's minions, which are "twisted into tentacled monstrocities".
---
39 so far. I have 2 of each elite spec and now I’m transitioning to 1 of each profession on every race.
---
I second this!
---
Personally I'm returning after a 6 year hiatus and spent the last week trying to figure out what to do even with a lifetime of MMO experience. I realized it was a terrible idea to pick back up my old main as I had no idea what was going on or even where I left off. 
---
From that perspective, I couldn't even imagine a new player even being able to direct where or what they would like to do. Additionally, and my wife is passive too, they don't want to interrupt or make you have less fun either. 
---
Definitely make a new character. 
---
Do not craft gear for her except leveling crafting as you go. 
---
Do not give her gold. 
---
Do not give her any unique armors or anything like that. 
---
Basically, if she gets the golden ticket I guarantee she will probably lose interest. 
---
We enjoy our accomplishments because we work for them. She will appreciate it more as well and have a treasured experience of leveling and acquiring those with you together.
---
which 7 ap are you missing in fractals?
---
Why are you the way that you are.
---
I love meep
---
Is it this one? The hope of Tyria?

So they can die more often, Harrier really helps with that! Same with Healbrands - its really fcking cool when the Healer sits at 8k HP and dies first!
---
 /s
---
Minstrel only gets up to about 85%-90% Boonduration with pots so sometimes you need more and go for Harrier. Also most people don't get two Healer sets so they prefer raid equip and get Harrier. Thing is you loose about 20% Healing throughput while using Harrier so its not the best choice for hps, some Druids like the additional Power for their Celestial Avatar tho but I really don't care about Healer dps. 
---
Some classes like Renegades really need the 100% Boonduration from Harrier but thats spec specific.
---
*The world eroded around you*
---
I've tried that, there were 3 gw2cache files, deleted all 3. Not working :(
---
Omg I love your vids! This is just amazing!
---
EOTM died because pips came out in wvw and it’s now far more efficient to do something in wvw every 10 minutes and afk than actually doing stuff in EOTM.

Every time I hear "debacle" used while on the topic of FO76 or Anthem, I think it's another YongYea listener.  He writes decently, but god does he love that word.
---
Forgive my ignorance but.. What damage? Is the healers (in that case druid's) damage even noticeable?
---
Mesmer isn’t actually very good in pvp right now, mirage is just very frustrating to play against. Frustrating/anti-fun doesn’t mean broken.
---
What savings? How about save us!
---
You know you can like... Not use mounts? 
---
I love mounts, and my favorite is the skyscale because it lets me go where i want; what you consider "fun bit sometimes a little frustrating" is irritating content padding for me.
---
Thank you 😊
---
More noticeable than defense from minstrel.
---
Depends what fractal content, sure normal T4s noone cares but look into fractal CMs and you will see that while providing your group with more Stability boon uptime you get way more group dps than Harrier ever could.
---
DPS on Healing classes is a meme, its really not where a wipe would arise.
---
inb4 +/-4k Druid dps is #litdps for you mate, a 4k difference in damage is a lucky crit for a Weaver/Dragonhunter/Soulbeast. Prefering Harrier for its dps is the wrong desicion.
---
They made arena on a map that already turned into gvg playground. Interesting enough for a map designed as overflow map.
---
Yep! It's \[TINY\]. We're pretty chill about most stuff, but that's our one important rule (and we let you know that when you join).
---
I'm relatively new to the game, playing for about 2 months. I'm using a condi engineer (yeah I struggled in the beginning but I'm ok-ish now). 
---
I've been looking for ascended gear for PvE/raids/fractals (not really interested in PvP or WvW at the moment) and most guides recommend Viper gear. However, I wanted a bit more of survivability and maybe a few Trailblazer pieces would be good.
---
What do you guys think?
---
You don't need to rep a guild any longer to receive KP
---
That is up to each guild to decide and something you need to ask when you join. It is say full rep then you are expected to fully rep. Some say if you play WvW you need to rep in WvW or if you play in PvE you need rep in PvE and so on. 
---
In your case i can see two issues. One would be why did not the guy who kicked you just whisper you first asking why you did not rep and then tell you that you have to rep or you will be kicked out. That would be a fair option. 
---
And two if you get kicked then why did you not whisper the person saying you were new and you were not aware of how it works when making a new character and did not even realise you were not repping and sorry about that could you possibly invite me again?
---
Either way it might be that you are angry with them and dont want to join back and that is fair, but for your next guild ask them about rep rules and what you are expected to do.
---
Why would you mock guilds who have those requirements? Why does that involves you what other guilds you are not even in do or don't? 
---
Rep rules are totally ok if it is said and explained. If you still want to join the guild who have those rules then you are aware of it. If you don't want to be tied to such rules then you pick another guild. There is plenty to pick from on all sides
---
I think this could be a fun idea and would be all for more customization options for all races.
---
But I do feel like with the existence of the infusions and their effects on characters skins could be their answer to this.  Unfortunately its a expensive solution for players.
---
Mistlock is my base and my love! only time when I go to LA is for story reasons...
---
Alright I'll take the bait on this one. How is this even cancer weeb music? There's no Japanese vocals or anything really unique to Japanese music in it. Is the simple fact that it's made by a Japanese person so revulsing to you? (Hell, I didn't even know that before I posted this, I had to look it up)
---
I love it, looks pretty awesome. Could you do more?
---
Unpopular opinion but I'm not too big of a fan of Kralkatorrik's final design. The next is too long and thin for the body, and his body is too thicc and short. It just looks slightly disproportionate.
---
There is only one teeny tiny thing that I'm not fond of in this race adventure : I was hoping that new ones would come with a timer that starts at 1st checkpoint so we don't have to abuse the "start" button anymore :)
---
\#choyalivesmatter
---
It would be really nice to get some more options for sylvari and asura when it comes to hair and faces as someone who has a ton of alts of both races it's real hard to make them unique after the first couple (since there's only some options to my taste)
---
Melandru damn it.
---
That actually allows me to be MORE involved in the general community. I have a guild that’s just for close friends to goof off in. I have two guilds that are larger communities in different time zones, so I can play with whoever’s awake when my insomnia strikes. One guild is a bank for my husband and I, and the last guild is a big, less social guild that is about organizing events and finding people to do raids and fractals with. Each one serves its purpose and I reel free to rep whichever one I’m actively playing with in that moment.
---
Good druids are hitting 4-5k which is a decent chunk. Killing the boss faster means you need less healing, boon uptime, mechanics, etc.
---
Cmon dude, don't be "that guy". He's new!
