It's [this thing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Death-in-a-Bag). You could gain multiple of them if you never opened them, resulting in mine having the name "34 Death-in-a-Deaths-in-Bags". It was such a quirky name that I kept them, but after today's patch they just say "34 Bags of Death".

---
Shame, really.
---
---
---
How are they threatening exactly?
---
Where tf is the night watch stool
---
I did the same thing. I valued my time and convenience more than my gold (still do). But if you want to save every penny, I'd recommend whatever is the green rarity salvage kit for greens and lower (and then mystic for yellows, black lion for exotics).
---
This. It always feels like it's 2 steps forward, 3 steps back. This feels like a re run of "expansion worthy content" only to find out that phrase included levelling cooking to 500. It was the same with their big announcement in the theatre and now this.
---
They have a habit of exciting people then pissing them off almost directly straight after.
---
This game needs some sort of monthly sub you can opt in for various gem store items. Imagine if you pay $12-15 a month and you something like: A mount license, a outfit of your choice, 10 BL keys, etc. That is a service a lot of players would gladly sign up for each month.
---
Each character gets three personal build slots.  You can get more by unlocking extra slots on each character.  Your account can have 24 shared build slots and you'll get 6 off those free at launch.  Technically, if you forego shared builds on other characters, you can have 9 saved builds at launch.
---
It's ok most people don't really understand the time value of money or do an analysis of what they spend on. It's the same reason people won't spend $2 on a mobile game that they'll play for 20 hours but will spend $20 on takeout the same day.
---
If you're in this sub you've gotten an incredible time value for your money probably. It costs like at least $60 to go out and get dinner and a movie at any decent place for just one evening
---
On the plus side, Ascended gear now actually has some value and isn't an ignored step child. A small plus side, but one nonetheless. From here I think it's far easier for them to add value to Legen. Whether or not they actually do so is uh.. on the table I guess.
---
I think arc just demonstrated the simplicity and full capabilities of such a system that it makes anets limitations seem needless outside of a monetization standpoint.
---
I think we'd still be questioning the limitations had arc never been a thing, we'd just be blind to exactly how much anet was limiting the system's potential
---
wait, you thought they were trying to make it MORE visible?  the effect that made your entire character look like they had a pink dragonball z aura?
---
I play everything, and I have [everything](https://i.imgur.com/OXjUKel.jpg).
---
Paying for equipment tabs is really not that bad...and can be justified, as it acts as extended inventory.
---
However, paying for build tabs is stupid and cannot be justified by any means.
---
it definitely looks less like an earth element spell, more like holy magic.  but anything that's a bright glow is going to get lost in this game.  no saving it really.
---
Would you care to explain to me how spending money on a bad product makes me less of a baby?
---
And exactly how much do I have to spend to be an adult?
---
Can I pay half price and just settle for teen or young adolescent?
---
Yes, the upper limit of 6 equipment templates is "fucking fantastic" /s
---
This community is absolutely insane. That is 24 builds account-wide, that you are NOT USING. When you pull them from the library they are no longer taking up space. So your character can have 6 templates and then you can have some in a "bank".
---
This is like declaring that 17 bank tabs is "not too much in the grand scheme". Are you fucking insane? WHY on God's green earth do you need so many goddamn builds? If you need more than 6 builds per character, why not just fucking make another character and use that character's template slots?
---
The system they showed off is more than anyone was reasonably hoping for. I was 90% confident that they weren't going to even let you store your equipment in the template and that it would be like the fan-made build templates in that it would just swap gear out. And yet the first thing I see, like always, when I look at reddit is people who haven't engaged with any of this and don't know what they're talking about telling everyone who much of a failure the game is.
---
&gt; i expect that this costs at least full 400 gems like bag slot
---
This is also what I put them at. If they're 400 gems I deem it acceptable. Anything more and that's gonna be a issue.
---
I just made a Twitter for my current art! https://twitter.com/ButterUp5
---
Yes.  Each character gets 3 personal builds, with three more per character available for purchase.  You also get 6 shared build slots that can be expanded to 24, so you can have some builds that all characters of one type can use.
---
I feel like you and I are on the same page in that a lot of work went into this so it shouldn't be scrapped, but the current sale model is offputting
---
10 years too late, thank you Anet ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Personally I think the Skyscale questline is bad game design, pure and simple.  
---
The quest line doesn‚Äôt know what it wants to be or what it is trying to achieve.  It literally feels like it was designed to time consuming for the sake of time being time consuming.  Even then, the components of the quest line feels like it was haphazardly thrown together with minimal rationalisation.  
---
It is a far cry from the Gryphon quest line, which was largely designed to reward players that fully cleared POF content.  Even then the Gryphon quest featured a major GW1 Nightfall character and had some awesome story moments built into it.  
---
The Skyscale is a classic example of what not to do in game design.  It‚Äôs a bad idea to deliver your rewards via ‚ÄúRube Goldberg game design‚Äù.  Rewards must always be a journey that feels natural to the player.  It is worth noting that the ‚ÄúRube Goldberg game design‚Äù is not restricted to the Skyscale and is something that affects Season 4 as a whole.  
---
In all honesty, I would like to see more discussion on reddit on the game design of GW2.  What works, what doesn‚Äôt work, what needs improving?  If the player base make a loud enough noise on the game design issues of GW2, we might start to see better game design in GW2.
---
they were scattered remnants who were no real threat, and then yes, bangar got them to sign a treaty offscreen immediately before the events of bound by blood.  hardly a "handwave".
---
it can be blocked with guardian passive lol
---
Another post! Here‚Äôs my new Twitter!
---
it's fun sized, like Halloween candy
---
because they need a "technical reason" to charge money
---
Was wondering the same thing xD
---
plot twist. all this could have been avoided, if they never allowed a 3rd party dps meter.
---
So that's why I got a key, not because RNG smiled at me this time =/
---
Yup, the exact nerf I was talking about. Killed condi reaper DPS.
---
I know, but im talking about dark bond as being separated thing and not only working with certain minion that has a 20sec duration Gw2 versi√≥n.
---
Im talking that you could mix and expand your minion capacity while having to sacrifice Hp (the Hp pool in general not life of the master) to increase the ammount of minions (based on the trait) you could have at a time.
---
Like if i wanted to use the one you linked from Gw2 and i wanted it to be "permanent" you kind of could, but then again Gw2 isnt meant for minions at all.
---
Its just sad because it could be a fun way to play at least those that would enjoy the feel of being an actual old school necromancer, hell you even see traeherne running 4 golems at a time, and so many other necros in the game doing so.
---
In fact some pve bosses are now elite specs, but minions are long forgotten.
---
Nonetheless i understand you showimg me gw 2 version of it, but its by no means the same feeling of being an actual necromancer minion master
---
They're being extremely hyperbolic. There's no way anybody could believe they came up with something that A) doesn't even fit the UI of the game, and B) isn't anywhere near as seamless.
---
People can hate the monetization all they want, I don't disagree, but to make claims like "worse than arc"... absurd.
---
A sub fee wouldn‚Äôt necessarily deliver the things suggested by the OP.  
---
GW2 has traditionally suffered from project management issues and game design issues.  A sub fee would probably result in an increased frequency of the type of content we‚Äôre getting already (e.g. Legendary Runes and Skyscale).  There‚Äôs no guarantee a sub fee would result in stuff like mount skins being obtainable outside of the gem store or more weapon/armour skins. 
---
I think if GW2 was relaunched under a management team, via a ‚ÄúRealm Reborn‚Äù mechanism then a sub free could definitely work.  The sub fee would have to work like other MMOs where it is optional and provides quality of life benefits (e.g. increased exp, all story content unlocked, 500 gems per month etc.)
---
Just to reiterate, this idea would only work under a new management team that would wisely reinvest the sub fee revenue.  I have no faith in current management team and I highly doubt they would wisely reinvest the sub fee revenue.  At the end of the day, the quality of your software development is governed by the quality of your project managers.  Bad project managers will always result in bad software development.
---
I see it as the only reason build templates were approved by stakeholders to be worked on in the first place, otherwise they wouldn't waste the dev effort on it (especially since it seems like a lot of dev effort was put in)
---
They could at least have a more expensive account-wide option that costs something like 10 times more, since there's no way they'll get a ton of people buying many of them in more than 9 characters.
---
I'm sorry, but the idea that because I mostly play one class and have a main means "I play less than 1/9th the game" is incredibly laughable.  Nor does it mean I don't have alts or haven't played them for thousands of hours either.  I've probably done more in this game than you have over the past 7 years, so please, go fuck yourself and don't tell me how I should or should not enjoy GW2. 
---
And yes, ofc I'm going to complain when Anet's version of Build and Equipment templates is a straight downgrade and limiting compared to Delta's version AND I have to pay for it.  And I'm going to especially complain when Anet's changes will affect me more than it will affect the average "log in once every two months" type player.  
---
And please, don't try to tell me the "Hard Limits" (6 equipment templates per character) are not an issue, because it absolutely is.  I have, as mentioned, dozens of builds with different stat and rune combos.  EVEN IF I WANTED TO BUY ENOUGH TEMPLATES TO STORE THEM I CANT BECAUSE IT HAS THE HARD LIMIT OF SIX.  That's a MASSIVE problem.
---
&gt; Goes on cooldown regardless of if a utility skill is recharged.
---
It's pretty clear that this is the intended behavior. You were too optimistic about them buffing it.
---
For any individual with legendary gear this is incredibly limiting, dude. I took so much time to give my guardian legendary armor, trinkets, weapons, etc. Depending on playstyle and game mode, it's not at all uncommon for people to invest in around 8-9 builds for a character they placed legendary gear on. Not even builds to goof off in, either, but legitimate builds used competitively depending on the game mode. 
---
I get that they think we should pay for the "armory" space, but that armory space does NOTHING for me, someone who sunk in enough time and effort to acquire all this legendary gear. With arc currently I can swap between multiple high demand builds within seconds. With this system, I objectively get little to no benefit on that character. 
---
It's not the end of the world, sure, and I understand that I am in a minority here when it comes to legendary armor, but this makes me feel like my effort was largely wasted. Sure, I can still pick whatever stats I desire, but there's not much point when I can't set up enough builds to spend significant time with a new stat/trait combination. It's just disheartening is all.
---
[removed]
---
6 is not a lot because there is more to this game than just story PvE content.
---
You might stick to a singular build, but others don't. You need to remember, they are actively removing the ability to have unlimited builds in order to replace it by their incredibly limited build selection instead.
---
They really need to start disabling that while they do not have the Virtue up.
---
It also works inside freaking Activities.
---
Went around trying to recreate what I saw to make sure [I wasn't crazy.](https://i.imgur.com/zxmReaU.png) If a Guardian has their passive aegis on, they are immune to a single roamer trying to get the initiative via the new Lance skill.
---
Which do you imagine? 
---
A. A build template should cost $1, but they are instead charging $1 for the stat template and another $1 for the gear template, forcing players to pay twice as much for both.
---
or
---
B. A build template should cost $2, but they are instead splitting that cost into $1 for the stat template and $1 for the gear template, allowing players to choose for themselves whether they always want both.
---
What if I told you, both models are completely arbitrary and they can just charge whatever they want and let the customer decide whether they want to pay it?
---
Not even insufficient, \*wholly\* insufficient. This dude expected a lot more than we all did.
---
Even for people who don't use ArcDPS, if you play each game mode, you aren't getting any new slots. We currently have three slots, one for each game mode that autoswap when you go to that mode. Now we'll have three slots that don't autoswap, but can be used across modes, which I guess is nice. 
---
We need at least one more gear and build slot per character to start with, so we actually are able to use them to swap between builds for a mode while still being able to have the functionality we have now of having a saved build per game mode.
---
You'll have more luck going to the train station to stop trains in their tracks with their bare hands.
---
Dead game mode.  No one cares.
---
It's for players that have multiple characters of the same profession, so they don't have to use the same template on multiple Characters.  Players that have one of each class, like myself, will use them as extra build templates.
---
Purple mess and random edgy outfit. You didn't saw proper fashion yet I assume.
---
&gt;This is also what I put them at. If they're 400 gems I deem it acceptable. Anything more and that's gonna be a issue. 
---
I bet my first skritt it will be 1000 gems.
---
Ok? Big deal? Guardians have aegis, it blocks attacks. No surprise it could block an attack.
---
As long as I have some chance to copy my existing build templates into the official templates I will be happy
---
I am well aware of the "upper limit".
---
I'd repeat myself again here, but clearly what I've typed is too complicated for some to comprehend.
---
It's in the blogpost
---
That would require me to remake all the legendaries I've painstakingly built over the years to add to another character.  
---
Get over yourself dude lmao
---
*It's been a long day without you, my friend
---
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again*
---
Did they fix daredevil-&gt;dismount 2/3 dodge bug?
---
That is literally the point of the opening post.
---
People tend to rely too much on outside sources rather than just trying things out and if it works, it works!
---
OOOOOOO gotta hit me with the vague "you're too dumb to comprehend my argument" and "I'm intellectually superior argument."
---
I'm SO shook.
---
I'm trying! I'm just really new and don't know what I'm doing. Please be kind to me. Lol
---
Or. Craft a fucking ascended set for less than a tenth of what you did for the legendary stuff. OR get over yourself and manually swap the gear's stats if it 's this big of an issue for you. You know, like you've clearly been doing all these years because you actually have a legitimate grievance and aren't just lying about this to manufacture bullshit about how this objectively great feature is really a "MASSIVE" problem.
---
Threaten? Why is him saying that he is quitting the game a threat?
---
He is a player that poured his time and skills into Fractals, a big chunk of the PvE end content, creating a clear, professional visual guides for the entirety of it, supporting their content through YouTube and twitch with every new release.
---
Yet here you are pretending that ‚Äúhe never streamed anything noteworthy‚Äù.
---
How did this community turn into such a bunch of hateful players against other proper content creators, instead of seeing the real problem with the game publisher themselves. Geez..
---
Even if I wanted to be milked and buy all their shit, gear template cap is what, 16 sets? Laughable.
---
He does have an NPC named after him in the fractal lobby though. But yeah it's not like any content creator has content to create anymore. Open world story is not gonna get him any views.
---
F
---
Subscription model won't work for Guild Wars 2.
---
1. ANET marketing suck.
---
2. Because marketing suck, ANET made base gw2 f2p to attract people
---
3. Competitive contents release are slow as hell, no one would pay sub
---
4. General player base are already molded/used to current business model, changing it now means losing a lot of customers from business standpoint
---
I think that selling us build slots is clearly a cash grab. I can accept selling us gear sets, as this feature will eat into their bag slot revenue, but selling the other is just unnecessary.
---
1 gear set, 1 build per character. I use this until a new expansion hits and say something like, "Oh, looks like power building will be better for this new elite spec!"
---
Cantha's making them all man-sized, for maximum production.
---
Funny how a free 500kb dll didn't face any technical limitations.
---
I reckon this might be a final straw for me at least.
---
I'm not lying about this to manufacture any sort of issue.  It is a MASSIVE issue for people like me, that play like I do, and have the things that I have and have worked for.  And people like us do exist btw, despite your very loud, vocal attempt to drown us out and deny our existence.  
---
Again, not surprised this isn't an issue for people like you or something that you care about.  What's funny though is that you care so much you're whiteknighting hard for Anet.  This is my last response to you though, as you're not worth any more of my time
---
&gt;not removing anyone's ability to do anything
---
&gt;other than guardians who raid and WvW have more than 6 builds
---
You are so clueless, it's almost funny. Mostly sad.
---
Well. The game should have launched with this. Now approaching 6 years later they‚Äôre ‚Äútalking‚Äù about it.  They dropped the ball
---
There was a time I‚Äôd disagree... but not anymore.. this is basically it now.
---
You get it from the dragon bash regalia coffee
---
Umm...build templates go live on the 29th.
---
you, I like your honesty. There is a limit of how whiny a person can be. I was all in with the comics criticizing the scrapper changes, but saying that there are NO ENOUGH SPECS for Engie is ridiculous.
---
Err.. could you please clarify what exactly prevents you from doing that currently? To the best of my knowledge, there's no limit on how often you can buy gems, and gems never expire.
---
In the end the test area's dmg pulse is actually better to see if a heal build is viable for raids than arcdps. On arc you either only see the average heal per second, that could include big gaps of no heal (which could be dangerous in raids), or you have to analyse the logs, upload it to a website etc. to see what you did. That takes much more effort than the test area aoe. 
---
Take the middle dmg puls, go inside and stay long enough alive for several minutes (5-10 minutes for raid bosses). You can see pretty easy if you are able to stay alive and if not you see easily where / at which point of your rotation the problem is.
---
If you are able to survive the middle dmg pulses, your healing build is fine for every raid boss. Easy as it is.
---
From the looks of it they can self heal very well but the AOE healing is very low compared to other healers and they also lack the ability to apply protection to allies.
---
If they would change the grandmaster minor to heal allies when you grant them might that would change however.
---
Yaaassss fashion, the true endgame. Love seeing what the community's imagination can come up with
---
&gt; other chars on your account can't use your gear templates, since they don't have that exact item
---
To be pedantic, for account-bound Ascended items, other characters on my account **do** have access to that exact item
---
Actually they're all busy masturbating over being able to 4v1 people trying to get back to the fight again  
---
Anet made WvW that much less appealing for a lot of people and everyone cheers because "muh easy kill dopamine"
---
They are absolutely removing the ability to use arcDPS templates.
---
I have more than 6 builds on my thief that I seriously use. Just because you use a singular build doesn't mean everyone else does too.
---
Is your CPU actually cooling? I have a Corsair H80 (original version) and neglected to clean between one fan and the radiator. There was about 5 years worth of dust built up. Might not exactly be your issue, but make sure your CPU is actually cooling.
---
Its about half what a guard can heal which in turn is about half what an engineer, ele or rev can heal.
---
It also lacks protection and any special effects.
---
I don't even really care about build templates. I know my traits and skills anyway, and the interface for changing them is at least decent.
---
6 gear templates per character is a hard stop fail. I have more than that on three separate characters with plans to increase that to a fourth when I (soon) finish my next set of legendary armor. Anyone who was approaching the game as 1 class = 1 character is getting hard screwed.
---
No?
---
&gt;Just whining
---
Yeah, you sure do whine a lot love
---
thank you very much, I'll go there now.
---
Those burns are insane. I‚Äôm guess a bit of power creep since I last played? I don‚Äôt remember seeing anything close to this a while ago.
---
Forced fights (because they can't get away if they wanted to) is ganking. 
---
Fighting over _objectives_ is roaming.
---
TJ max was hit every time within 20 minutes of having it open. Case fans and pump rpms I could not get the readings of. I had applied an ‚Äòx‚Äô shape of paste on my cpu.
---
Meant half a decade, but nonetheless the point is we've had templates in Arc for almost 5 years now, seem shitty to give us a lateral-at-best solution now.

Yeah sorry I guess its hard to install Arc.

I don't think anyone should pay for chat link space.
---
The reason that Equipment Templates took so long and may cost a gem price is because they just expanded the "Equipment Storage" that already exists. Because of this the item doesnt really exist in any storage it exists on the character. Therefore tons of QnA went into verifying the item doesnt dupe or delete. Not really a complaint but this method also limits the ability to do a "Multi Character Equipment Template" since it is now tied to that character.
---
The solution to this would be to make a new storage. Then have the build template pick and choose items from the Armoury Storage. There for all templates will only gain or lose connections to those items not the items themselves when you create or delete the templates. It would give players an easier way to see what important items they have on a character instead of haveing to filter threw every template. You could allow Account Bound Armoury Inventory Slots to exist for multi character builds. and it would have saved all the QA that comes with inventory managment since it would reuse what we already have for inv managment on our bags.
---
Selling the inventory storage would be more reasonable then selling the templates. So more equipment presets due to the value existing in how many items you want in your Armoury Storage.
---
Right now each Equipment template has the ability to store up to 60 item slots (Weapons, armour, runes, sigils, infusions) and that will effect their price and its why we only get 2 for free due to this design decision.
---
I hit TJ max repeatedly and crashed my PC before I made the adjustments.
---
Or they make something less shitty than what they currently have instead of some bloke that has a bit of spare time..?
---
We don't say colored anymore.
---
wha?
---
Alright, are you willing to pay gems for the slots to fund that development?
---
I remember I got the Shrine Guardian skin when I first started doing (Regular) key runs. This is how RNGesus hooks you
---
All cores running that hot, or just some cores?
---
All cores
---
You can; use notepad.
---
I don't want my builds stored locally. I play on 3 different computers and I want the game to *just work*, I don't want to tote around a config file to each computer every time I make a change.
---
There will be a hotkey
---
that is pretty sweet.  Not as sweet as a better system, but still pretty sweet.
---
I would love one of my asura, please let me know when you have a free slot!

0
---
every character should have unlimited build template slots, including equipment.

if you want to sell extra different versions of bag slots to hold equipment go for it.

Ok, well that's Herlads. You were whining about Guardians.

Why would a skill be placed ingame to engage two people in a fight, that only Guardians can easily just walk away from? You can dodge them on Warclaw, but to outright not need to put any effort into not getting engaged is dumb, and your argument is as well.
---
LMAO!
---
Ah, sorry then - I thought that build templates are "the last straw". I get how you feel, but from my perspective build-in templates are something I really appreciate (cannot use addons on MacOS). And it helps that I use 2 builds on each chars I have. So it's perfect for my needs. And stopping the introduction of build templates would be definitely something I'd like to not happen.
---
And now the "but...". GW2, as you saw yourself, have this business model that relies on ppl buying stuff in gemstore. And templates are thing ppl will definitely buy, so no wonder they want to sell it. And to be honest: it's just their goodwill that they allow use of third party apps. It's not browser that having add-ons is a must. So knowing that they have to pull a stunt like that to keep the game going, I am gonna just agree with the terms on which they decided to re-implement templates. There are unacceptable practices ofc, like heavy use of loot boxes and RNG - and on that occasions I would protest. What I'd call the situation rn is "nice enough, but could be better".

Charr shoulderpads are ridiculous. I get that charr have an odd body shape but they don't need to hover a foot or two over the shoulders.
---
Alacrity is definitely impactful for me but the original visuals weren't too helpful compared to looking at the green cd on your skill bar
---
So if I have one set of legendary armor w/berserker stats equipped can I have the same set of armor only with Viper stats in a second template for the same character?
---
"Give us real tangible stuff on build templates, 'cuz I really do think they're losing people's hearts and fast-- including mine."
---
Considering he's a GW1 veteran and has used ArcDPS, I'm really curious to know what he thinks of these build templates. I'm just real curious you know? One thing he has said he won't stand for is a sub fee on GW games, but you gotta wonder if Anet would. Would they do something like that? The company that knows everything we loved about GW1? Hmmmmmmmmm.
---
Anyone called dibs on his stuff yet?
---
&gt; if we ignore the slot limitations
---
yeah but, the limitations are real.  They aren't going to disappear.
---
...So literally all they did to the original barrier &amp; alac visuals was just palette-swap them?  
---
smh...
---
I would say GW2 PvP can have a bigger skill jump to get started getting into it because you have limited access to abilities and some popular builds can really destroy you. WoW PvP is slower, every class has access to some annoying shit that lets them be a big tanky for a while so you get to learn some stuff before getting blown up.
---
That being said, balance-wise GW2 is better with more ways to vary your builds and counter things or play around others. You also have the benefit of standardized builds and you scale to levle 80 when you enter PvP. It's not like WoW where if the meta changes and favors one class build over most others and you don't happen to have that one geared then you'll have to grind it all the way up to compete.
---
Aegis sometimes need to pita some skills like de f1. This is silly when you use f1 from the stealth and aegis block it... this even not do dmg -_-
---
I see this guy a lot throughout this subreddit, can i get a tldr to who he is?
---
everyone in here is  complaining about an upper limit, and how people who have lots of legendaries will be affected by this.
---
  well i just read, builds can be shared, copyed, and have a special code attached to each and every build.
---
so why can't you make your own build copy down that build code and surpass the 6build limit by remembering its build code off the top of your head.
---
oh my slots are full,.....thank god i can remember  how to type in [Warrior Build 111465376] and just use a post it ctrl+v .

or am i gravely mistaken and will be beaten for this comment?

It reminds me of the anime called "That time I got reincarnated as a~~n Asura~~ Slime". I really like the warmth of the picture. Good job!
---
Hey just like those WvW alliances that have been coming for *checks calender*
---
Oh.

Want warmth? ;D  https://twitter.com/butterup5/status/1179235380085870593?s=21
---
To be honest I could just mention Sweden, but i'd actually like to bring up an even better argument: Take a look at Japan's poor, or even what Japan considered to be a "ghetto".
---
&gt; These guys worked hard for a long time to get one of the most requested features added to the game. 
---
Yeah, right.
---
The way the left charr uses Celestial Blue infusion is creative and worthy of commendation.
---
&gt;Yes, for me is so strange that ArenaNet don't want add any extra premium so they can get some extra income.
---
It's cuz they're amateur as hell on average and rarely have any good ideas that aren't just "different" for the same of being different.
---
yeah i'd like if it swapped between the two once a minute or so
---
or on a mouseover tooltip
---
People believe a sub fee would reduce gemstore releases. Wish I was that young and naive.
---
&gt; Did they handwave it offscreen 
---
Yes.
---
Agreed.  Let's try free for once.
---
You should ask for a refund. That feels like a bait and switch.
---
"Complain about having build templates that do less and costs more than the existing 3rd party solution"
---
FTFY
---
Most players are reasonable people. We understand some monetization is fair, even necessary. But to have it function at a much lower capacity than ArcDPS templates and almost zero account-wide support for legendary equipment and upgrades while charging for it? People are rightly outraged.
---
Me: My pugs never last beyond 1 boss
---
Only thing i can say is mounts help cut down on the to and from ive literally only did this once soo far on an engi which seemed slow with the killing.
---
24 shared max, and 6 max per character. So while you might use like 15 on your Ele, that‚Äôs 6 for the character and 9 of the 24 shared. Unless you use more than 5 builds on every single one of the other 8 classes while also not having any duplicate classes, you‚Äôd be fine (it‚Äôd just cost a bit of gold for those shared slots, or extra Ele characters, or etc.) Its not great, but not THAT bad. 
---
Extra characters (1 PvE Ele, 1 PvP Ele, 1 WvW Ele) makes that a lot more viable cuz that‚Äôs 9 builds + 3 to share between them for free if you‚Äôve got the character slots for it (so probably 1 build for each game mode if you wanna do something else without having to switch characters.) 3 per other classes is probably fine, and if you need more than that I think the hardcore players will have the spare gold to buy a few extra slots (character or build or etc.) 
---
It‚Äôs not perfect but there are at least workarounds for those who really need more.
---
So currently I have a Mesmer with everything legendary expect the second ring and amulet . I have in arc DPS 5 different builds. But when the last 2 accessories get released I still need to buy additional templates if I want to store different stat selections with that singular set of gear? Then what is the bloody use of legendary gear at that point. 
---
I may as well have kept my 5 sets of ascended gear and put those in the templates instead. Legendary gear is just a complete waste of effort in this case. I also don't understand why there is a limit on build templates if their excuse is that it's saves inventory space. It does for gear templates but not for build templates. 
---
Am I missing something here or what? This is such a shitty cash crab for people that spend all this time getting full legendary...
---
Why are you here then commenting? You have zero investment or interest in the game if you've stopped playing.
---
Not how it works. The chatcodes only tell the build what traits and skills you should have. The real nuisance is having your gear change to the correct pieces, and for stuff like legendary gear swap to the correct stats/infusions/upgrades. Those don't have chatcodes. I mean, think about it... if what you were saying is true... why would anyone ever buy extra slots, when having all the codes you need in Notepad would be enough.
---
Arcdps's build template breaks the terms of service because it reads game memory. Arenanet worked with Delta to allow this feature to exist under the condition that it be retired when the official build templates went live. They made a massive exception for the add-on. 
---
They also stated in the livestream that there are backend issues that prevent some features from being part of the the template system. For now.
---
So I refuse to pay for a game sub. I buy the game, Pay monthly for my internet, and pay monthly again for the game? Nah there is a sucker born every minute. 
---
On the other hand. I have spent exactly $70.00 USD in the gem shop since lanch. I have better things to spend my money on. 95% of the gem shop skins are garbage anyway. I "Possibly" would buy armor sets. I will NEVER buy an outfit. 
---
However, I did buy both expansions and would buy even more expansions. This Living story/Saga thing won't be getting any of my money. Simple as that. They want my money they will make xpacs. 
---
So either way, really, they won't lose much in me by switching to a sub-model. I would just go back to playing BL3 and GW OR whatever else I play at a given moment. 
---
I love the game. Its great. But Xpacs are the way to go for me.
---
It's a skill guardian has. If you don't want to deal with it don't engage in the damn fight. If you do want to engage remove the damn aegis and engage.
---
Well the first step is to fire the whole team that creates the cosmetics lol. The designs are pretty much piss poor.
---
&gt;SO naturally they're going to default choose a high price. 
---
Ok, but, again, it's up to the players to decide how much they want to buy into the system. If it's higher than you want to pay, don't pay. 
---
&gt;In this scenario, I doubt they would find a price for 1 "Full" build template that would be equivalent to the price they end up at with two "half" templates they're selling, since there is that "upper limit" of "what price is acceptable"
---
Also, different players might require different numbers of each aspect, so it's more affordable to them to buy only the parts they need, rather than having them bundled.
---
Good lord, you're a contender for Olympic gold in mental gymnastics.

---
I bought bag slots because of gears and now anet wants me buy more? Their delivery of monetization is getting worse every time. Yeah, you can say not all buy bag slots and all. But then let me ask, do those ppl spend any real money on game?
---
I wouldn't mind this anet being greedy and all if anet was providing contents consistently. But as I've said multiple times, it feels like anet is milking on ppl that actually spend real money on game as if there's no tomorrow.
---
This template thing would satisfy casual gamers and most ppl here. But as a guy that played the game for years and spent gems frequently, it's cluster of disappointment with latest live streams, which just turning me to a casual player without buying anything from BLTC. Currency either in real life or in game gets valued from the insurement that it carries the value. And I just can't trust anet is doing good job on it.
---
Some may ask, then why you play? To answer, I don't play that much but hesitant to uninstall the game yet. I've invested way too far to do that. I know sunken cost should not affect on a person's 'economic action', but that's not really how it works in real life. So I'd say I'll still log in to collect dailies in hope that some day I'll get some contents that I'll enjoy or they ressurect wvw from just being a k train grind.
---
Before they gutted all the engineer builds last balance patch my templates for it were similar. RIP.
---
They were intended to be unique skins, so yeah they shouldn't have had that advantage.
---
Not jumping over an aviator box at Tarir  , come on .

---
popping aegis doesnt put you in combat, so if you get the drop on them and can autoattack, mount and then use this skill, then it will work
---
The only new partners they've been adding lately is fan artist channels. They're mainly non-controversial, so it's an easy/safe option for them to promote.
---
I do agree that it feels bad to be nickle and dimed for templates. For failing to reciprocate for 7 years templates should've been added with no gem bullshit in sight.
---
So, the right way to address this: review dailies. There are days that WvW is easier. There are days that PVE have a majority of easy things (Mystic Forger and vista/any resource collector are the only ones that come to my mind. I really don't count bounty/event/activity/adventure since most of them are boring garbage). But I have to shift between those two, PVE and WvW, if I really want to be sure to have my 2 daily gold. And I am not even taking into account things needed for legendaries.
---
We are at each other's throat when actually the system is at blame for having PVE people, with PVE goals, in WvW. And I know it is not like we didn't suggest changes for anet, but welp......
---
&gt; After being spoiled by Arc for all these years, this is going to be a big downgrade.
---
Something 99% of GW2 users have never heard of.  I, for one, am happy as fuck.  You might need to adjust your expectations as you continue to want cheap drugs when they have just been legalized in your state.

More accurately he is a data miner. Hacker in this context can have negative connotations.
---
Go back to Kimetsu no Yaoba, Michael Jackson!
---
Size matters
---
Me too. I was salty over the lackluster ‚Äòevent‚Äô in August, but now this build template issue is another nail to the coffin
---
The most builds I've ever used on a character is 2. Switching between Druid and Soulbeast, and between condi and power berserker.
---
&gt;"The Armory" is the internal name for the gear template storage area. This was mentioned when asking about moving ascended items from the bank to the character.
---
No no no. We should go to The Armory. That's where Zadorojny is likely to be.
---
Same, working on a hunter, I will throw 25e at them for Forsaken.
---
Guardians must be meta in every game mode!
---
Do you have a new build for every utility you swap? Why would you need 25 Mesmer builds?
---
It's quite the double edged sword in it's nature, isnt it. There is barely any option to monetize this that doesnt mainly target players that are putting in an extra effort (hence feeling like a punishment for doing more than the minimum). I'm personally in the situation that i slowly replaced extra characters that i made for builds by getting legendary armor on my original toons.
---
Personally, my wishful-thinking solution to the monetization would be along the lines of decoupling the amount of gear templates from the gear storage so that a person that doesnt care about the storage or mainly runs legendary gear gets to make as many gear templates as available/their inventory can take. Those that enjoy the option of storing their gear outside of their inventory for those templates could then buy gear storage packs that hold, guesstimate, 20 items which should equal one full gear loadout?.
---
Cause ultimately i can't help but feel like a major point in pricing for gear templates will be a result of the included storage space.
---
On a confusion heavy boss, this will for sure go over firebrand, problem is what the other person said indeed, confusion heavy bosses aren't great for stacking, so the 240 range is too low
---
If you play enough to be using a ton of builds, you can probably spare a few hundred gold for your convenience?
---
Do y'all just... forget that gold to gems exists? 
---
Like if you're playing on all 9 classes with more than 3 builds per every class so you can't spare your 3 extras for your main then yeah, you probably should have some gold or be able to grind it out. Its not that unreasonable, assuming pricing on it isn't ridiculous (yet to be seen.)
---
Okay, it's October now!
---
Can it be dodged?
---
what?
---
You only need like 10-20% before alacrity to upkeep iirc.... just oil can get close, and SoC weapons to swap to... not much they need.
---
That's a really long time.
---
Just leave the old add-on available: I have like 8 sets of armor on my main, one alt for each class: there's no way I can manage all that gear manually.
---
If the thought in my head is as they said in the announcement webcast. Being able to have diff gear sets and ofc diff builds I‚Äôm all for it cuz means more bag space that isnt holding diff weapons.
---
To maintain the old Scourge playstyle you have to waste a shade on yourself, so your overall control of the battlefield goes down heavily. If you have to move a lot you either sacrifice more shades to be able to cover yourself or you forgo your defense. Overall Scourge is a lot more squisher for more work and potentially less dps as you have less shades to work with
---
You basically took the words right out of my mouth on build vs gear for templates.
---
Its like shared inventory slots, they will increase the limit over time. When the limit is increased in a patch the gem prices will go up and it will force more people to buy gems.
---
Don‚Äôt get why they didn‚Äôt at least buff damage numbers in PvE while making this change or CD of shades or literally anything
---
The feature has seemingly pitted "hardcore" multi-mode multi-build players against "casual" players. That's not meant to be a dig at casual players, it's just the word to describe the type of player who logs in occasionally to do living story and open world stuff. There's nothing wrong with that and I spend alternating stretches as each of those.
---
Reality is, if you are the type of player who plays multiple modes and uses several characters with different builds on each, well... you can probably get away with the caps in this new system. Being able to link builds is also handy.
---
But I have to say, I'm real disappointed at just how much this restricts you until you have to pay money.
---
And it's not in a petty way. It really is in a disappointed way, because this feature makes me envision an alternate universe where we'd be getting an expansion, and this would be a headlining feature. You buy the expansion, and you get all of the slots that build templates have to offer, along with the content.
---
Chopping off features and selling those, rather than bundling features and content together to sell at once feels gross and turns me against the game hard. Everything about this feels like the inverse of how the game should be sold. Monetize the content, not the quality of life.
---
They were legal to begin with, and you could have them for free, including delivery, you just had to order them manually. 
---
They now are under state control, everyone gets some of them (without ordering) but not enough to please them. You can order more for a premium, but ofc the free ones are now banned as the state wants it's $$$. Also they are far worse.
---
Yeah, your way of thinking really makes it a lot better and reasonable...
---
Yeah i've also got to calm down after my initial very strong reaction (and them adding bulk stat-changing to gear certainly helped with it too) but then i made the fatal mistake of browsing reddit :D
---
Overall the entire system just feels like such a harsh contrast to the previous quality of life we got from the game - like wardrobe, outfits, dyes and so on.
---
I think no one really expected them to not at least go for some monetization in this, but 3 seperate sources at once was quite a pill to swallow. And you're right, the templates themselves are pretty much just a line of code like a chatcode (for example in guild wars 1 the codes looked sth like this [OQcTExp25xswXVYIMjP/bCKAA], so i'd expect the gw2 equivalent to me similar) so yeah, monetizing on saving this on their servers instead of locally feels kind of... underwhelming. Who knows what tech or technical limitation is behind this, ultimately it seems like it can be bypassed by an extra step anyways.
---
A special legendary equipment slot sounds like something with potential cause it still feels quite devalueing to the gear i crafted. And i can't imagine how much of a letdown that is to those that went even further and crafted all the legendary trinkets so they ultimately only have like 2 trinkets + weapons that are actually being stored.
---
Sooo... what about spvp and wvw legendary armour ?
---
Dont you think we hear the term "we are limited to our own code" far too often from anet? It got old years ago.
---
I really really really hope, that, eventually, we are gonna get some sort of compromise in this.
---
I'm not a coder so I'm not real in tune with just how challenging this was to implement. But I can say when GW2 launched it had a VERY different design philosophy than GW1 or even present day GW2. At launch there was a huge effort to reduce the games complexity over the first, especially to cut skills and make balance easier for the team. I would guess at launch they hoped to design a game that wouldn't even require build templates. Over the years though the game has expanded and developed a build complexity of it's own. Now they are retro fitting a system to a game that likely wasn't built with it in mind. I think to say it's simply a "basic UI feature" isn't quite doing build templates justice in GW2.
---
Well, you were the one who wanted an opinion.
---
About monetization: it's obvious they would do that, but there's a big difference wanting to pay for build templates (the system) and HAVING to pay for every build slot on every character and still not have enough for more than 1 game mode.
---
About convenience: yeah they remove gear from your inventory, that's cool, but i already have 320 slots on my main so i don't see the point of it (for my main), but still locked to 6 builds on that one, which are just the raids builds i have for free with arc. Fractals, wvw and gvg don't even fit in the slots.
---
Thinking of the people that really minmax their gear, even if its only a tiny amount of the playerbase, is what makes it a bit dissappointing to me. Granted you can probably remember what to manually exchange on a few classes but ultimately shouldn't exactly that be what build templates are supposed to help with.
---
For gw1 you only needed to copy a folder that's it. Quit the bs. It was plenty better 12 years ago and can't even keep the qol a free third party tool gave you. Just bad.
---
You're right, let's all get our credit cards out and support this company!
---
In all seriousness, and forgive me if I am mistaken, but I don't think you have the same feelings towards their decision to monetize something like this like I do because you didn't play the first game. I've been following and playing the content of this company for 15 years. I can tell you with absolute certainty that these build templates and equipment templates were not monetized in the first game and it a flat out slap in the face for them to make us wait 7 years and pull this. They were never about the money originally but this game, the Gem Store and them seeing what whales will purchase has fueled greed.
---
You can say it's a company and that's fair, they have to make profits and I understand. That being said, as a company you want to make your customers happy and they don't have to monetize every little thing you release but instead they are choosing too with the exception of the Living World Episodes which I'll give them that.
---
A while back after the Deepstone fractal was released Bookhati and I broke out and he created a nice video of snippets from our exploration. He got some good shots of our spelunking adventure in Deepstone. I don't think this was already posted, so I'm sharing it now.
---
It was a very fun map break and dangerous too.
---
I love it.
---
You're a mistake.
---
I'm happy with incoming build templates, no matter if it's paid thing or not. It's good for people who don't have arcdps (and honestly I don't see any reason to have this thing).
---
Thanks for understanding man.
---
The underlying factor for me was that I've been following and playing the content of this company for 15 years. I can tell you with absolute certainty that these build templates and equipment templates were not monetized in the first game and it a flat out slap in the face for them to make us wait 7 years and pull this. They were never about the money originally but this game, the Gem Store and them seeing what whales will purchase has fueled greed.
---
It's unfortunate but it's the way things are now with the developer and this game. I saw them go from caring and engaging with the community and the game to straight up monetizing everything they can get away with when it's not necessary.
---
&gt; Two people dancing around each other on their mounts for five minutes straight
---
If that's only two and not more people, why don't you go into PvP instead of WvW?
---
Why announce something like this other than to generate drama/attention to yourself? I‚Äôd hate to see prominent members of ‚Äúthe community‚Äù leave as much as anyone, but I think this is kinda childish. The game doesn‚Äôt revolve around you.
---
At this pacing, when is GW2 going to run out of Content Creators? I've lost track of how many have stepped out of the game; more than I've ever seen for a MMO.
---
Nor did I claim you did. Hence not a straw man.
---
Noone asked for this extra storage. Idc about extra storage. I want to change gear and build quick. I couldn't care less if it sits in my inventory or not.
---
Oh no, a random person on the internet called me trash... If only there was a button that could block any further communication from that person.
---
People are whiney sometimes. When you get too much, you start to expect too much.
---
Doesn't make it any less true. It will probably be true unless they go rewrite a ton of the game or build a new one. That's what WoW had to do, but they also have regular downtime, GW2 doesn't which limits what they can do with the code/DB schema/architecture of the game.
---
I just don't get the hate.  The way everyone was talking I thought it was pay only.  I think it's ridiculous to see that you get 3 per character for free and people are still talking like ANet ran over their grandmothers.
---
Let's make a *2-hour* video about a *2-minute* topic!
---
&gt;EA kind of monetization.
---
are you stupid?
---
What have they done? This is bs. 
---
Noone asked for this extra storage. Idc about extra storage. I want to change gear and build quick and many of them. I couldn't care less if my gear sits in my inventory or not. People wanted something like in gw1 or what arc does. The whole fucking purpose of build templates is to have as many fun builds as you like. This is just shit they can monetize. Give me a propper system people actually asked for and I pay just to access it if money is the problem. Who the fuck came up with this abomination of "templates".
---
As long as you can get rewards for afking in game there womt be any drop in the number of afkers. There is virtually no punishment for them.
---
An optional subscription sometimes hurts games more than others. Look at ESO, they added an exclusive feature that generated **a lot** of backlash.
---
Quality of Life is about users, why don't they even ask us questions before or during spending money, time on something ? It only give more ideas about it and lead to a better product.  
---
They started the BT development 2y ago and they didn't even see problems in users testing session how is that possible ?  
---
Well, we "hardcore" players aren't there target is the only possibility or this company lives in another world.
---
dont try to argue with this special case of whiteknightism. i gave up yesterday
---
They aren't going to let us keep arc, and they should work on the build templates NOW. Before they release this - sorry - clusterfuck.
---
The changes I'd want for the skill/trait builds shouldn't be hard to implement.
---
- Give us unlimited skill/trait templates on a character.
---
- Sell the KEYBINDS. Hotkey-Swapping? Great. Pay for it? I wouldn't mind! But I don't want to pay for the basic skill/build templates, but it would make sense to limit the amount of available keybinds. 
---
- Sell the shared skill/trait template spaces [I still don't see what they are for, but whatever.]
---
For the gear templates, it will probably be harder to implement:
---
- Let us save unlimited 'blueprints'. (No gear load out) 
---
- Sell the LOAD OUT only.
---
This results in: 
---
- You can still share your gear across characters, without deleting your gear templates.
---
- Actual QOL improvement for Legendary gear
---
- People still being able to get the gear loadouts
---
Wouldn't it be nice if we could have it this way? It would be an actual upgrade over Arc Templates!
---
Most of the playerbase would be fine with it (minus the ones just crying wolf for the sake of it), according to comments I've seen from both the "hardcore" and the "casual" side.
---
Players: This is outrageous! it's unfair! Why do we have to pay something to a company, that depends on us for survival!  
---
Arena net: Take a seat, players.  
---
Players: Yes, master...
---
Waaah waaah
---
This community is actually getting more and more retarded as time goes on. If Deroir is moving out, than people should be worried and wonder why. He has been one of the content creators that has been incredibly invested in the game and still sticking around despite what the game as become. This thread is completely irrelevant.
---
What if it was positive in nature? For example, "I love this new feature! Great job Anet, I'll definitely be staying for years to come!". Would you still say to him "The game doesn't revolve around you."?
---
I don't think you would. So say what you really mean, that criticism or showing of concern of any kind is unwelcome in your opinion.
---
How dare they rob you of the fun of killing of full minstrel guard with a roaming spec :o
---
Either your definition of 'everything' is funny or you are not actually reading what I wrote.
---
Can you input chatcodes to switch builds?
---
Living world is not free if you are not there on release. That counts as paid content.
---
Why would anyone pay for a hot-key when the manual template switch would take like 10 seconds?
---
&gt; 3 because it would've won our hearts and restored some of the lost trust.
---
They. Don't. Care. The game is dying. They know it and we know it. They'd rather just milk what is left of the player base who are seemingly relentlessly loyal no matter what decisions they make, than actually try to win over old players or bring new ones into the game. Imagine not playing this game, then hearing that 7 years after launch they're finally giving players the ability to save and load builds, but that they're charging for it.
---
What do you think supply drops are ?
---
I do not use so many builds . I do not want to pay for a subscription . Most people do not even need additional build at all .
---
If you want the game to die then add a subscription.
---
If u want the support every month then buy gems every month
---
on top, even if you unlocked them during the release period, you still have to buy PoF to actually play them
---
What happened to being able to play how we want? That only applies when playing how we want means how you want, right?
---
Chore Templates?
---
The same reason people want build (as in skill/trait) templates in the first place: 
---
People are lazy in general.
---
Why would anyone buy skill/trait templates at all, if a manual switch takes like 10 seconds?
---
Yes, Lord Vader
---
Well, its not like he has much else to talk about...
---
Moons haunted
---
With manual template switch I mean going from template 1 to template 2. Switching all traits and skills obviously takes longer.
---
&gt; Where I work, we aren't afraid to tell our customers or business side "No" because sometimes what they ask for would either not work, make things worse, or be too risky to complete. Just because the customer spends money/wants it doesn't mean they always get it.
---
Well we weren't told that build templates are impossible, so what exactly is your point?
---
&gt; And if you pay attention, the entire project (which includes the planning before development begins) took almost 2 years to get where they are.
---
I think you're the one who wasn't paying attention to the stream. The timeline for the project went like this:
---
- October-november 2017 - design work started
---
- April 2018 - implementation of build templates started
---
- Beginning of 2019 - implementation of equipment templates started
---
Quoting my message:
---
&gt; I can understand gear templates being a problem, **but builds - give me a break**.
---
I was talking about build templates development, which took from april 2018 till the beginning of this year AT LEAST, hence 8 months.
---
&gt; That's not how development works in most cases. It's iterative and changing, to say it will never change contradicts what they said on the stream.
---
Have we been playing the same game for 7 years? Have you seen how often ANet was going back to improve on old systems? They almost never do! And if they do, it can take them years until they get to that point. Let's take a look at a fascinating example: the LFG panel.
---
It was released in September 2013 and was not touched anymore until after HoT release in 2015, when raiding was added, prompting them to finally add squad support despite players clamoring for that for 2 years (world bosses, taxiing, wvw). The next update to it came in March 2018, where they added a search box. Meanwhile, Open World category continues to be a mess for years. The window, when resized, always keeps the category panel to be half the window's width, which is utterly pointless because the width of the data in it is fixed, and by resizing it along with lfg listings panel they make it harder for players to read lfg descriptions. There are still bugs where lfg item can sometimes stuck in an empty state, making the list grow vertically infinitely, leaving mostly blank space on the top. You can sometimes stop "watching" a category serverside even when you still have the window with it open, resulting in lfg listings not updating until you change category or click Refresh, except you won't even know there's a problem. If you change category too often, you can get stuck, unable to switch them. And these are just bugs, I'm not even getting started on additional feature that could be added to it. But 6 years have passed, I remind you. So enjoy waiting for future improvements to templates, I guess.
---
&gt; The limitations on builds is a technical one

Once again I don't understand what limitation are you talking about. I'm perfectly content with the technical implementation of them. It's monetization I have a problem with. The fact that they will be selling you what is essentially a bunch of text strings for a premium. The name is limited to 32 chars, double that for unicode; I expect chat links to be at most around 50 chars long; we get a total of 114 bytes per template. You know how much does it cost to store 0.1 KB in a database? Orders of magnitude cheaper than the cost of 1 gem.
---
Salaries? Dev time? Don't spend 2 years on it! How, I'm sorry, HOW is it acceptable to work on a simple feature like this for TWO YEARS? And yes, it is a simple feature in the context of the ENTIRE GAME. How are games being made at all, if it's supposed to take TWO YEARS just to make build templates? If you want to tell me this is supposed to be common practice, then we should be looking at 1-2 decades of development time for a reasonably complicated game. But yet we somehow aren't, 5 years in development is considered abnormally long, and acceptable only for MMOs. Iterations? They spent 5 months (refer to the timetable above) working out the kinks of the design, "trying to catch all problems at design stage" (almost a direct quote from the stream). They came prepared. If after 5 months of brainstorming you still haven't came up with a solid plan that won't need to be radically changed and iterated upon when it come to implementation, then you're simply incompetent.
---
The rest of your post just as much unsubstantiated fluff as mine is.
---
Thanks for your 'thoughts'. 
---
How is this 'exactly what we want', it is most definitely not a perfect solution? It's ok to monetize parts of it, but the shared builds and character builds should be **unlimited** and probably free.
---
I'd be happy if we were only paying for the equipment templates.
---
It's wvw and pvp they should have no use at all. So Anet has developed a tool for two years to archieve that by devaluing legy to two asc sets. /s
---
You just made the point. You have a few extra builds to play with, why can't everyone have a few extra builds to play with? Why only people who play like you? Why can't I have 5 builds on one character? Why do I need to pay to have the same fun you're about to have? Isn't that the entire point of adding build templates? So we can have that extra flexibility to play with our build?
---
Somthing else I would like to mention:
---
With the current iteration you will always have a template equiped. Any changes you make to your current build apply to the template. So actually we are only getting **1 Gear Template and 2 Build Templates**
---
No u
---
If you know your traits? Not necessarily. 
---
Have you ever watched a speed runner video? It's crazy how often they switch things around :)
---
The increased target is there only to make up for the loss of targets hit by the shade effect around your character (3 + 3 around you before, now it's 5 around you or your shade). It even is a nerf with only one shade up.
---
I try to dodge but at that part of the meta, my CPU is the temperature of the sun and my FPS is lower than a 20s silent film. Not to mention the visual chaos on screen.
---
As a chronomancer, I feel vindicated. That's about as noticeable as the pink cloud.
---
On my Mesmer with Legendary Armour, Runes, Weapons and Trinkets its a total downgrad from arcdps build template since i can only safe 6 different builds after i brought the slots. So i need to pay for smth i can do atm (which got greenlight by anet atleast to end of october) and i am not as free as before because i am limited on 6 different gearslots.
---
But yea if you dont got legendary aka on my other characters it safe bag space which is nice also i hope that they dont sell every upgrade character bound since that totally would suck. i am okay with accountwide upgrades but i totally hate character upgrades.
---
pretty sure they said that due to the way builds in sPvP work the new templates won't work with it so so technically you get 1 new one (plus the 3 extra you can get on launch)
---
&gt;Why **some** veterans are concerned with official build templates: in numbers
---
Fixed that title for you. 
---
I am a veteran, I am not especially concerned. I will use the free slots and the things that won't fit in those I would either buy another slot for or simply move things around manually, as I have done for 7 years without any sort of issues.
---
And that is from someone who plays all 3 main game modes and switches around builds quite a bit.
---
Have gotten bascially the same indications from other veterans in our guild, including people who mainly plays PvE raids on multiple classes (including Mesmer).
---
Wait, so you can't set dyes separately? Dyes should not carry over form one gear template to another, because color schemes that work with one armor would not work with another.
---
you are not paying a sub fee of $15/m, that $60 would have been worth 4 months subscription.
---
That makes exactly one of you. In a game of hundreds of thousands.
---
What's your user name maybe we can play sometime .

Looks like OP touched a few nerves lmao
---
People who enjoy their game and want them to continue making it?
---
I wasn't exactly *demanding* this, but I think it'll be fun to play with. Being able to swap build concepts at a button press is much more convenient than going through the menus.
---
I role play with builds a lot, and so have ended up with pretty much 1 build for each skill type for each profession. That's close to 62 builds just for open world casual PvE.
---
I then have 5 builds for raids and another for fractals. 
---
I currently have 3 for WvW, as well. I don't play PvP, so none there, but if I did, that would be more.
---
To cater for all my builds, currently across 2 game modes, I would need 71 build templates, which arcdps stores for me for free. However I'm now going to be limited to 33 baseline, unless I want to pay through the teeth for the possibility of additional storage.
---
They monetized them too agressively and without any consideration for those that will actually use them. You should be able to have like 6 from the get go and an unlimited amount of expansion. This at least covers most players who use templates heavily even if they end up paying for them. But having 3 with a maximum of 6 is plain bad. Casuals never use templates so even 3 are wasted, hardcores tend to use a ton, especially on certain classes, so a limit of 6 is very problematic. Anet is slipping with bad decisions all over the place......
---
It all depends on what you enjoy. 30 percent completion is nice, but not as nice as playing the class you enjoy. 
---
Try different things, experiment, see what you like.
---
What I did when I was starting is to roll all classes and visit structured PvP with them. It might not be exactly the same, but you can try most of the skills and weapons for free in a fair comparison and see what you like best. It took me whole evening to try all, but I felt like I kinda knew what I was going with and what to expect from other players.
---
That being said, a two handed sword warrior, for instance,  could look as cool as as other classes (:
---
do whatever ya want, you could always pick up the warr later
---
For ONE Equipment template? No way. Even for a bundle of "1 Equipment template + 1 gear template" it's too much.
---
I'd recommend just looking at other games than GW2.  Come back every 3-4 months to look at the two hours of new content every LW episode and leave again.  This game no longer welcomes veteran players, ANet is mainly focused on new players and casual players.
---
I'm in general mostly impressed at how civil the discourse has been so far. Sure, bullshit on both sides. But compared to the screeching hysterics that usually set this sub aflame is Anet as much as breathes? Exemplary.
---
Regarding the issue itself, I think it's pretty clear to everyone that arcDPS has to stay. That's probably the biggest reason why there isn't too much of a divide.
---
Warrior is a strongest class in any game mode(I don't say about broken build etc) so don't now from which side other are cooler. üôÑ
---
&gt;2 hours of contents every 3-4 months would be beyond me
---
To be fair, your argument there is being as stupid as the original one.
---
There actually were armor templates, but only for PvP. I believe it was weapon types + weapon upgrades + armor upgrades.
---
Since all of them are empty, i'd say its just for the meme
---
You're also a dedicated anet whiteknight. Best save your powers, you'll need them as anets need for money grabs will only increase.
---
Okay. I'm not gonna disclose how much I've spent on gems, but I can tell you, paying for each ls episode would be extremely cheap in comparison.
---
If others don't spend money on the gemstore then that's not something I can do anything about. I'm just saying I'm not spending money on templates as I think it should be free. 
---
But yes. I'm damned spoiled.
---
No he's been very clearly whining about the state of the game for months now. There's a saying, "if you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all." Why is that? Well because it's just painful on the ears. You can have fair criticisms, and I'm not saying any of your opinions are wrong or unjustified, but it's *vastly* blown out of proportion, and if this update is what breaks the camel's back, then I think it's well deserved.
---
Like I said in my previous comment, I really don't understand that black and white thinking. It seems to be you're either only playing this game, or not at all. Just quit for awhile, come back when you're bored, and see things with fresh eyes and you'll realize it's really not a big deal. It's not hard to memorize a few traits in your trait line and having to click them yourself, and it's certainly not something that's game breaking.
---
In PvP I probably have 15+ builds per class, and I play every single class. I have zero issues simply remembering what I take frequently. I also have a hard time believing that other veterans who supposedly build craft so often can't memorize traits in a trait line, and most of the time it's only one trait line, or about 1-2 traits that are actually specific for your fractal, or raid encounter and whatnot.
---
Going off of your argument, this game does encourage trying out new builds and testing new combinations. Does that mean you need to have a save option for every single one? No it really doesn't. If you really know your class at even a basic level, remembering what traits and *why* is trivial. If you understand the reason why you take certain traits, then it's pretty easy to logically walk backwards and figure out which traits to take. For example, if I'm Chrono and want to share buffs in raids, it's pretty damn important to take the inspiration trait line to share buffs between 10 people. That practically describes a third of my build right there, it's really not that hard!
---
Because that's a completely different game mode, which, outside of custom arenas, is designed for a group of five, has way less gear customization and in general is... just not WvW? Where I can join a large group without even changing map, defend towers take camps or w/e?
---
It's two seperate gamemodes
---
&gt; when you equip a piece of armour it is deleting the item form of it and applying the equipped version of it to your character. It becomes a object tied to your character and no longer accessible via other characters. 
---
I don't quite get what you mean. There is no difference of the item being equipped in the current system, being in the regular inventory in the current system and being in some slot in the future system. None is available to other characters, unless you actually move it to some sharable storage.
---
&gt; The limit would be less harsh if they didn't include this storage. Have Gear templates link to the gear in storage. If you would like the gear to be stored as well then sell the storage separately. Make a new storage format/bag type that only stores weapons/armour/runes/sigils/infusions.
---
That sounds like a better option, true. It would also provide an incentive for legendary stuff, as this would allow more builds for smaller storage. Another way to do this without totally redesigning storage might be special bags that you can replace your regular bags with and only stuff within those can be used for templates. This makes those items still easily accessible, limits overall storage, as they would still count against the total number of storage slots, and it would allow for customization by everyone to their own needs.
---
There's always criticism with everything ArenaNet does. Nothing is ever good enough.
---
ArenaNet: releases something
---
Subreddit: "Okay but actually [criticism ranging from good to bad]"
---
Repeat every few weeks. For like the past 8+ years. Don't you guys ever get tired of it??
---
I don't mind if it block skills that do dmg, I'm talking about skills that don't... f1 dead eyes skill for example...
---
You can get 6 for free
---
I think going back to manually switch shit is like going back to a questhub grinder MMO. I'm quite convinced that I won't be able to do it. Just like opening stacks of bags pre open all without an auto clicker, or building a stack of superior siege without a mouse recorder.
---
It's basic QoL now, and I'm more likely to not do it at all anymore than doing it in the worst way possible for no other reason than a big, honking fuck you by Anet. The switch back is too big a step back for me personally.
---
That's not putting down the ingame templates. It's solely about the template *addon*.
---
All will be perfect if arcDPS's build templates stay.
---
Hear me out. Could people make another external application that is legal but interfaces with the new build template system. With the security and edge cases of the new system.
---
WeirdChamp
---
Omg, how long will you talk about this stupid templates -_-
---
&gt; It's like Hearthstone's deck slots all over again...
---
Imagine the CS guys when this launches and thousands of people who don't read any media or patch notes or literally anything suddenly have "the game break" when they change game modes.
---
Chair from wing 7 cms does the justice too
---
And just like that I finally understand why we get 2 gear templates vs 3 builds. Guess we'll have an extra free one on release of sPvP gear templates then
---
Even if you simplified it down to having only power condi and support (which I know is not enough) you still need to buy an extra gear template :/ 
---
I thought 3 would be the absolute minimum but as it stands I would need to buy at least 1 extra slot on nearly all my characters without even thinking about wvw builds
---
So, after having some time off and thinking about it... the biggest gripe I have with the build templates is that they don't separate gamemodes anymore.
---
Right now, you actually have 3 builds on every character. One for PvE, one for WvW and one for PvP. They will automatically load whenever you enter the respective gamemode. 
---
This will change with build templates: you now have 3 slots and can use them all for PvE, or just some, or none at all and judging by the things they showed, you'll have to switch to them manually. That's great for people who only play one mode exclusively, but not for people who like to play more than one gamemode.
---
Another thing is the limitation of gear templates. 6 per character seem low for some classes that have very situational gear builds. A solution that behaves just like the account-wide build storage, just for gear could help maybe? But the way the system is set up, this won't work.
---
I don't have a problem with them monetizing the feature, as I already expected that to happen, I just think it's very limiting in a way that is unnecessarily complicated, maybe I'm just not thinking this through correctly. Just wanted to share my concerns.
---
This is due to the poor explanation about the % drop chance among the categories (Common, uncommon, rare, superrare). It creates false expectations.
---
In this case though these special skins have a rather high drop chance compared to other uncommon items. If you open lets say 100 keys and get 6-7 uncommon drops most surely the special BL skins will be included among them. (I know from experience since i only open keys when new of these items are released and stop as soon as i get them all. In my worst experiences never reached to 100 keys, being the usual from 20 to 40). This higher than expected drop chance on BLC exclusive stuff is definately intentional to create a higher expectation that you can get all the shinies.
---
BUT,
---
The problem is that it's ussually the opposite, and the higher the tier the more unfair it can become. The best example is with the highest tier. Lets say (for examples sake) that a super rare tier is reserved for items that have les than 1% chance to drop. Well you can put in the same bag items that have a 0.9% chance with items that have a 0.0001% chance.
---
It's also more tricky because nowhere is clarified that each tier covers the same range of drop chances for every kind of loot box (super rare might be &lt;1% in some kind of boxes while being &lt;2% in others). And if there's no clarification the only thing we can do is have people keep opening them and sharing the results to get an idea. But with super rare tiers not even a person opening 10000 boxes and sharing the result gives a big enough sample to make sure of the drop chances of the super rare tier.
---
I have opened tons of BL chests since the game launched, no idea about the exact amount but it's probably quite high since i did those key runs a lot back in the day before they nerfed it. But i was wise and didn't use them right away. I stored them and started using them when the good shiny stuff started appearing on them. Defintelay i don't think i have opened 10k chests, probably it's more closer to 5k. All i can say is that i have never got a super rare tier drop from a BLC.
---
This subreddit is the worst merry-go-round. Every time something new gets released, it immediately gets criticized. When is something just good enough?? Never, not around here. It makes all of it blend together into a meaningless blob of negativity, obscuring the actual problems.
---
What's going on here o_o
---
When you're a content creator for a game and you've been for a long time, you kinda built a community around yourself and the content you're producing. I don't see this as a way to generate drama/attention to yourself, but more as an information he gives to his followers that he may not be producing anything anymore, so they don't expect content from him.
---
Yes. I don't regret going for three sets of ascended armor instead heading for legendary.
---
Judging by your post, I can infer that you are not using arcdps templates currently. Thus, for you, Anet's templates are a net gain (from no templates to SOME templates).
---
Those who have been using Arc's templates however, will now have to pay quite a sum of money to retain functionality (from many templates to fewer templates or equal number of templates, depending on how much one spends). While I am glad that you and your friends do not find coping with Anet's templates an issue, I hope you can understand why some people who have been using arc would be very unsatisfied with this recent announcement.
---
Depends what you like to play. If you want to quickly kill stuff play power warrior without the banners. If you want more flexibility play guardian. You can find optimized builds for open world through metabattle‚Äôs website.
---
THE MEMES
---
I have no issues with the builds because I can always put extra builds into a Notepad after the update hits. Janky work around but whatever. Being limited to 6 gear templates MAX is the most infuriating thing in the world when you play classes like Mesmer or Guardian where you have to worry about condi duration capping, crit capping, boon duration capping, etc. What's the point of getting a set of Legendary Armor when you can only use 6 builds effectively? Anything after that, enjoy manually selecting stats and runes and infusions? At that point it's actually just easier to use additional sets of ascended gear.
---
Because content isn't optional, having a bunch of build templates is. Will you people GTFO already with your paywall for content, FFS.
---
I like that your looks are very fitting to the fantasy setting. I always prefer when there is a clear theme and nice choice of contrasting colours that aren‚Äôt too vibrant or washed out. Nice!
---
&gt; For my mesmer, I will need to buy 6 equipment slots, for 2400 gems total. Please note that some mesmer players have far more builds than this, just for instanced PvE content alone.
---
You can't buy 6 equipment slots, max of slots you can have is 6, so you can buy only 4.
---
Why not buy 10‚Ç¨ worth of gems? You get your sub and a choice of free additional stuff from the gemstore's selection.
---
Yeah this is a serious buzzkill for me. I have over 20 guardian gear variations saved on arcdps right now that I will never be able to emulate no matter how much gems I pay. What a joke.   
---
On the other hand, Destiny 2 is now free to play.
---
because it would be for the whole game and not just for the last update, ffs. 
---
you think ppl pay blizzard 13 bucks a month only for the last update? 8 2 5 was 15 minutes of "content".
---
I completely agree, unlimited build templates with paid gear templates.
---
The account bound build storage spaces are supposed to let you save builds you click while you're not on the class that uses it, since you can only view other ppls' shared templates while you're on the classes they're for. I think they should just let you view all the build templates you have on your account regardless of what class you're on at the time. That way you can also share your builds for a class you're not on with someone who is currently on that class without anyone having to swap, would be great QoL for things like raids.
---
The storage spaces seem like they're currently intended to hold builds that you don't want to lose but aren't currently using on a character. Which is pretty useless tbh, they're just traits
---
Are you sure about that?
---
Tomes of Knowledge. They seems to sell pretty high. Are people using it for leveling alts? and if they do - when it's a good level to start 'Spending them'? Or It's actually the Above level 80 price that makes Tomes so important and I should avoid using them during leveling?
---
Also, Crafting. It seems like my Crafting level is goes real slow. It's hard for me to find materials to builds things that level me up (Weaponsmith, Leaderworking). I know there's gw2crafters, but I prefer for the first time to do it "old-school". In other MMOs I player you unlock new recipe when you level up your crafting profession. I didn't see it happen with GW2. So how are you suppose to level? buying recipes from Vendor so you will have more options to level up? or those recipes are end-game mostly?
---
Most of the legendary armor skins are ugly as sin, and with awful dye channels too. (Medium perfected envoy, anyone? Somehow it has fewer dye channels than the medium experimental envoy??)
---
&gt;Let's say you play 4 classes everyday and each need the 6 build templates available. That means 3 build tabs and 4 equipment tabs to purchase. For 400 gems / pop that a whopping 11200 gems which is 140‚Ç¨.
---
That really quantifies it, doesn't it.
---
Even if they make increasing slots account-wide, that's *still* the price of an expansion for something that's currently free.
---
I fucking love when people try to speculate on software problems in other companies with zero knowledge of the systems involved.  
---
They should just totally just hire you.
---
Also on the list of unexpected things blocked by Aegis: dummies' detection fields in Ash Training Course adventure in Grothmar Valley. Gave me a mild WTF moment this morning when I tried it on my guardian.
---
He was looking for a reason to leave, and he just picked the first thing he found slightly negative. He couldn't blamr it on poor prologue because it was done very well : )
---
Exactly. A cheaper character-bound option for people who want to pay just what they need, and need on their mesmer or druid or whatever, and a more expensive account-wide option for people who want permament unlock. I'd be more likely to pay for the latter even if it's 10x more expensive (30x to unlock all tabs, even if I'd probably not buy 30 character-bound slots otherwise)
---
Hmm I guess that makes sense. Although I still can't see the need for many of thoser shared templates. :) 3 (or rather the 6 we get) will probably be more than enough, since I can just store the copy-paste for the skill template in a local text-file \*shrug\*
---
So you'd prefer 0 critisicms and a world where you get to plug your ears and imagine the game is perfect?
---
I'm full legendary equip on my elem, my build as condi and my build as power will take one or two storage slot? Cause it's still the same stuff, so it free nothing as place except one ring I can swap manually... So the "leggit 800 for a slot cost" is bullshit...
---
&gt; Power Boon Support with full minstrel if you need to absolutely go full toughness because there are PUGs who can't go lower (like the handkiter can't do it)
---
OR there's a rando in their 80 boost soldier gear who managed to blag their way in to a raid, stayed silent during the toughness check because they don't even know what toughness is, never mind being able to find it until they spend the first pull trying to kite Vale Guardian all around the arena.
---
&gt; I'm just giving a warning that trying to enjoy the game as a veteran player is going to get more and more difficult for the majority of long-term players.
---
Dont you think that other veteran players have enough game experience to make that decision for themselves based on their own needs and goal in game?
---
&gt; In some cases, like mine, I have no reason to play GW2 anymore because of the removal of Monthly AT
---
How often do you change your build during a MAT?
---
&gt; which still has not returned, even though it was originally cancelled July 24th
---
Announced for this saturday
---
Must feel super embarrassing for you then that the clown is right if that's all you have :)
---
Wonder what that makes you
---
How? Does it have a chatcode input like arc? And yeah, I agree, non of my comments regarding the build templates are positive. It even gets for my Necro reaaally fucking close with the cap.
---
the 3 slots at release will have saved your 3 currently builds you have equipped in pve/pvp/wvw per *default*. you can change it whenever to whatever you want.
---
when you enter wvw from pve your build will still change automatically like always. so you dont have to go to your template tab and click it. thats how I understand it.
---
Probably not. What would that external application do? Giving unlimited build templates? That would not be different from arcDPS and it would undermine the monetization of build templates by ArenaNet. 
---
You can like it or not (you probably won't) but build templates have to bring in money. Besides selling the game once to a new player selling gems is the how ArenaNet makes money. How they pay their employees. So for every feature they make they will look at how to make money with it. The business case for build templates is making players pay for them. We get a few for free and we will be incentivized to buy more. 
---
There is off course another way for ArenaNet to make money and that is to develop a new (paid) expansion. A lot of players would love that but it doesn't seem that ArenaNet is going that route. Either they don't think an expansion will bring in enough money, or selling gems is more profitable, or they simple cannot get the funds to develop an expansion.
---
This comment is toxic af.
---
Well their earnings haven't gone up the last few years so doesn't seem like it, at least not enough new players to replace and increase the paying player base.
---
Reimbursed with a corresponding number of gems? Seems like a no-brainer.
---
The intense jousting gameplay we always wanted
---
key runs? Since the story level 10 is nerfed to once a week your choices are:
---
1- Personal story, Final mission of level 40 (meeting in Lions Arch)
---
2- Personal Story, Final mission of level 60 (fleeing from Claw Island)
---
(These 2 are easier/faaster to do that what you would expect but of course not to be considered a farm like level 10 was. It's specially easy/fast if you have stored tons of level up items from birthdays)
---
3- LS2 has one mission (Into the laberynth) that rewards one.
---
4- HoT story has one as well (when you reach Rata Sum)
---
(These ones are easy to get but since you basically require a level 80 character cannot be considered on farm level)
---
5- Map completion. There are very easy to complete maps out there for a chance at a key as a reward. To make it fast look for maps that don't have hearts to complete. The easy winners for me are both Bloodstone Fen and Dragon Fall. You can easily do each in 15-20 minutes or less but then again you need a level 80 character since the instant teleport item for zose zones require a level 80 character and even if you use a teleport to friend item low level characters don't have a chance to get a key.
---
6- You can get them as a drop. Yeah, it's true, they can drop. I can even say that their drop rate is higher than that of a precursor. But then again this is not a farm.
---
So TLDR; No farm exploits found that i know. The closer you can get to farming is the 1st one i mention but you require some of those level up items from birthdays to bypass the grind level, so you will end up using all of them.
---
This is an important note, that I barely see anywhere... as addition to having even less templates you will also "ruin" your currently equipped template by temporary changing things... if you then switch to a different template, you will save those temporary adjustments "by accident"... I expect this to be a main cause of gg's in fractals/raids, when people notice their template did not load "correctly"
---
my dude
---
Path of Koda boots :)
---
I doubt anyone will try to release any more 3rd party apps considering the game is losing popularity and Anet's stance on them going forward.
---
To be fair, if you consider templates as shortcuts for roleswaps and accept having to do customization manually they are fine.
---
The issue is that most people are used to complete freeswaps even for minor stuff like slotting in a couple of assasins pieces or changing runes/traitlines, due to ark allowing it/prior experieces with gw1/other games.
---
In the end you have to play with them to see how they work. 
---
I for one am still willing to take the qol they will bring and i hope other people can give them a chance as well.
---
let's not forget that she also celebrated tb's death on twitter
---
the library is templates to be shared accross an account. (and isn't important because you can save the templates as a chat code in notepad)
---
you can only have 6 gear templates or 6 trait templates per character.
---
I had a stroke reading this

For traits/skill build, there's a chat code. So if you wanted to be cheap, you could just save all your builds externally in a Notepad file. But there's no chatcode for gear, and you're hard capped at 6 gear templates even if you wanted to buy more, so if your character has more than 6 gear variations, you have to do them by hand.
---
After 7 years, this filthy casual has 12 toons, one of each and some doubles. My Necro main has 6 builds. Between this slap in the face template money grab and the nerf to Necro/Scourge PvE again, it only further pushes me away from supporting Anet anymore. 
---
\*Oh, and 7 years of Spaghetti code excuse is way past getting old.  If I didn't perform at my job and kept using the excuse it's too hard, my ass would be on the curb.
---
There's no need for that.  It's just multiple permuations.  Even to put it drastically simply, you have:
---
* tank vs offchrono
---
* dps vs boon support
---
* power vs condi
---
That's 9 possible combinations right there.
---
If it means being limited to only 6 gear slots per character I would rather they get rid of the gear storage feature and let us keep it in our inventories
---
only your traits.
---
You can't chatcode your gear templates.
---
The PvP playerbase has been dying for years which means the few people who still play are mostly veterans who don't have any patience when they get new players on their team that don't know basic map strats or duelling experience. Doesn't help that the skill floor is quite high for a MMO since people can burst you down in seconds without you knowing why.
---
That would be fine, but it also imply you can have 3 build templates for all 3 game modes each, for a total of 9. I highly doubt that's the case, otherwise it would be shown or stated somewhere as that's something to brag about.
---
A lot of this is dependant on pricing, is it # per equipment/build slot per character? 
---
Or ## for # slots for every char on account.  Are the slots sold in singles or just packs?
---
It's a real pity they couldn't find a way to share equipment as codes though, just knowing the stat combo and sigils is enough.
---
oh boy...
---
There's the thing that you don't need to store all variations of a build. If something is just one skill swap or weapon swap...you just do it. And now you will know that whatever changes during encounter you do, you can always just go straight to last saved template.
---
The disappointment with Anet must be strong with you.
---
First thing? You make me laugh! This is the very first time I've expressed any intend on leaving despite my **many** problems with the game. This isn't the "first thing", this is "the most important thing for me to enjoy the game" which is getting crippled intensely.
---
The potential of this single feature has been the sole reason I kept on happily grinding the game to maximize every profession. The limitations of the system however, will force me to either (1) abandon my main toons with their legendary armor in favor of buying more character slots, or (2) be contempt with only playing a minimum of builds. None of these options are desireable to me.
---
Read, I do not want to leave, but if this limit to build templates is put in place, all I see is *my* greatest joy about this game getting chopped to shreds.
---
6 templates just isn't enough if you play your class seriously and want to be optimized.
---
The monetization feels like milking a dying playerbase.
---
People who say "don't optimize" and "it's not necessary" are kinda toxic, they tell others how to play and enjoy the game. It's basically the old hatred for people who actually try to get good.
---
We had this in the form of arc. But there was an agreement that build templates via arc won't be available anymore as soon as arenanet develops their own templates. Which is fine. Sadly, we go from "as many options as we want, for free" to "limited to max. 6, pay for it."
---
it's the first part that's the problem. And, like I said, the old absolute toxic af shitheads who can't stand people who expect a good product. Or want to optimize. 
---
Just look at things like this:
---
&gt; 1% of the player base loudly bitching that they don't get 25 build templates per character for free when they haven't even tried the feature before.
---
Literally this thread. It's dumb af.
---
Can't speak for pvp as I never do it, but there is very little toxic behaviour in pve. With 90% of content being open world people are very chilled out. 
---
The worst thing in pve is usually at high level fractals or raids you will have a hard time getting groups if you dont optomize your character and pull your weight, but that's pretty much standard for games
---
What did you expect? Sunshine and rainbows?
---
I'm quite the hardcore player and am still super excited for these. 
---
I've never been a fan of 3rd party apps in games, so like you, these build and gear templates are a huge upgrade for me. I'm really happy that we will have an in-client system. I'm planning to upgrade my Chrono to 4 of each tab and see how things go from there. I'll make minor tweaks to builds depending on fights as I do now, but I'll be able to do large switches with two hotkeys. Planning to add a Mirage build in there too... I never had one before 'cause it was a pain to swap all that gear.
---
these are not "random thoughts". you are clearly against everyone who is okay with the implementation. nice try.
---
On yesterdays stream they confirmed the equipment unlocks will be "inline with other storage upgrades since they give you more bag space" which to me sounds that they'll charge a bag slot amount (400 gems) per unlock.
---
Really ? Is anet a Onlus? I do not think so. They decided a free number and if u Need more than that is you who want an additional service.
---
Let's try like I would explain to a two years old. If I have a house let's say they give u a free parking slot. But you have 10 cars. Then you have to pay for the additional 9 most people won't never need. It is not an exploit. Moreover if I have so many ascended sets and armor u can pay for an additional service.
---
You guys are crazy
---
Play unranked instead of ranked. And to get better map awareness you can try the custom maps area/
---
Pics would be nice.
---
Even more convoluted...
---
Oke... so I need stay far away from pvp... but that was my main point at the end game - pvp, what a shame :(
---
WvW is pretty ok
---
I get your point and for owners of legy equip its stupid, but to even to make it free for legy owners you would need a complete set of legendary everything. I for example only have legendary weapon and backpack. The number of fully legendary equipped players is probably very low compared to the playerbase.
---
But PvP is not endgame..not really because you can play it from level 1.
---
Those visuals are usually about others seeing that you have alacrity, imo.
---
PvP templates have always been separate.
---
**Just to summarize the issue ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù players have:**
---
Most of them are currently using multiple builds and multiple stat combination on many different characters for *one gamemode only*.
---
They are currently using a legal tool called ‚Äúarcdps build templates‚Äù which gives them an *unlimited amount* of builds to safe on any character **for free**.
---
**So for example**, I‚Äòm personally using 5 raid builds with 5 different equipment/stat-combinations for my Guardian only. Apart from that, I currently saved 2 WvW builds for my guardian. *So overall, I‚Äòm using 7 different builds with 7 different equipment/stat-combination*.
---
The **current situation** is comfortable, giving me the chance to save the templates and load them via ‚Äúarcdps build templates‚Äù and I even have the option to save like an unlimited amount of builds if I want to.
---
But **with the new build template feature** I only have access to 3 build template slots and 2 equipment template slots. **If I‚Äòd like to save more builds, I have to buy them in the gem shop. So I‚Äôm forced to pay a disproportionate amount of money, just to gain back the game experience I‚Äòm having right now.** And even when I would have bought all of possible slots, it‚Äòs not even enough space to save all the builds I‚Äòm activeley using right now. So I have to drop off some builds. Sure, there‚Äòs also the option to change everything manually, but that‚Äòs a pain in the ass right now. And honestly the players shouldn‚Äòt be forced to it that way since the actual awesome feature called ‚Äúbuild templates‚Äù should get me rid of this problem.
---
&gt; Delusional whiteknighting is the most entertaining aspect of this game.
---
Dude, can you teach me something? I mean, legitimately teach me this mind set. I get frustrated over this. I can't stand to see people being like that. I can take it if people have a different opinion, but how am I supposed to deal with it if they base it on pure idiocy and misunderstanding and still get their way because they scream the loudest?
---
I really struggle to find entertainment in that. Because it helps ruining things I enjoy.
---
It's not a big problem or anything, but I regret that I get worked up over it for 10 minutes instead of, i don't know, taking a longer, nice hot shower in the morning.
---
So what kind of mindset do I need to enjoy this a bit?
---
Granted, I'm living in my rather elitist friend circle of educated people, because I chose those. So I tried thinking that maybe, just maybe the ones posting here are the same idiots I see outside. Still doesn't work. 
---
Idk, pls help.
---
One point you actually missed. As of the current shown material you cannot buy 6 additional slots for your Mesmer, but only 4. Which means you either create a new char for the 2 additional builds or you swap around manually (Which is kinda stupid when you actually have buildtemplates).
---
Fun times.
---
increasing earnings isnt the goal of any business, its increasing profits after operational costs.
---
I mean, it really is.
---
It's literally a scam.
---
I haven't done PVP in a couple of years. I didn't remember it being that toxic, but I can understand how it would have gotten there.
---
I'm sorry this happened to you, and can assure you the community is a lot nicer in PVE mode. I've never had anyone be insulting towards me in PVE, and I am a casual player who often blunders through things. As long as I don't blunder my way through high-tier fractals, nobody minds, and even in fractals, I've never been insulted. (I've never attempted raids, too serious for me).
---
I also play in WvW, and people there have been nothing but nice.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Im courious what is the communitys opinion on that Skyscale quest line?
---
As soon as they have it they convince themselves that it's okay, because they did it. 
---
I came from dota 2 back in the day, too. The communities are shockingly different yet similar....
---
&gt; then
---
than*
---
Which *"drama commander"* from FSP are you referring to ??
---
The pre-HoT months truly were a weird time and beautiful time for balance, stuff like this crept up a lot. 
---
I remember getting a few hackusations from surviving someones burn guard with my thief.
---
Something *smooth*
---
It's sad that nowadays some people thinks it's normal to have thoses features in exchenge of money just because the game is subscription free.
---
If you compare to a lot of game subscriptions free, just a cash shop with cosmetics is a strong starts and allow a very good business
---
**95% of the payer base:** WHO?
---
That's "I want my money back" level bad. I would legitimately attempt to get a refund.
---
True, guess their operational costs may have gone down after they fired a third of their staff when their attempts on other projects failed and were cancelled.  
---
I'm just really sad that they attempted to create other projects while letting GW2 stagnate to the point of not even having any plans to create more expansions.
---
False! You have to heal from time to time. And jump. And move in at least one direction. Also, it would be extremaly hard to do anything outside of core maps to accomplish anything that way. 
---
Also, your downvotes may come as a result of oversimplifying a complex issue. Yes, the game is easy - it's an MMO after all. But that doesn't necessarily mean that pressing more than 3 buttons is redundant, just because you can do stuff "easily" with that gameplay. Not to mention how boring it would be.
---
I misread your first part as equipment tabs for reasons unknown...   
---
Now I'm just going to leave it to reinforce what you said as being the good stuff.
---
Welcome to GW2 PVP
---
Something people don't need behind a paywall, yes. This is no different than bank and bag slots. It is an item of convenience and nothing more.
---
&gt;and in the meantime just searching for a new main in PvE.
---
What about reaper?
---
Maybe it's your picture.
---
Just report every douchebag you encounter, don‚Äôt talk to them, block if they continue to harass you. Live‚Äôs to short to care about toxic ppl. And tbh. I met wonderfull prople in pve and wvw. I wouldn‚Äôt say ppl in pvp were often rude, rather just deliciously salty. ;-) In comparison in WoW I recived death treaths or kyses, so in my experience WoW was way worse in this regard (f-mage/pala few years ago). Now I am just another carebear, so maybe pvp players went on different level, but that‚Äôs how I remember pvp (mesmer main here btw).
---
Actually, you all chose the hill. You are okay paying for literally every other item of convenience, but not build templates. No stink about bag slots or bank slots or character slots or home instance nodes or buff items. Just build templates. You chose this fight, not me.
---
Not sure if this is good place to ask this but here we go...
---
To mods - can we get flairs? For example news, datamining, rant. I would like to filter this reddit...
---
To be fair, the recent patch (before today's one) cut the number of engineer builds I used frequently by 1/6th. Used to play condi engineer, power holo rifle, power holo sword/shield, condi holo, wvw roaming scrapper, support scrapper.  
---
  
---
Now my legendary armour set sits exclusively on wvw roaming holo cause they fucking gutted all my builds in one patch and I can't be assed any more when other classes are easier to play and have a higher output.  
---
GG anet for saving me money on build template slots.  
---
The comic is still pedantic though.
---
&gt;You do get three. There are three game modes.
---
PvE, PvP, WvW, Fractals, Raids.
---
Nope.
---
&gt;This is like declaring that 17 bank tabs is "not too much in the grand scheme". Are you fucking insane? WHY on God's green earth do you need so many goddamn builds? If you need more than 6 builds per character, why not just fucking make another character and use that character's template slots?
---
Because I enjoy tweaking my character for the maximum impact. I want to use the proper sigils and utility skills on every fractal level, I want to have a few min-maxed open-world builds for different scenarios and I want a raid meta build for raids. That's why.
---
Sure, I could only play the raid build everywhere and do the job just fine. But that's less fun *for me*. So I won't. I'll just manually tweak stuff when I need it, because the hyped-up, official, paid feature doesn't give me enough freedom to do it through it.
---
1. It's oracle and lotto.
---
2. They just outright mentioned 6 max character bound build templates, 24 account-wide build templates, 2 free equipment templates, unspecified limit to number of equipment templates but definitely no account-wide version.
---
FYI, there's no such capacity limits for ArcDPS templates and they are free. And because ArcDPS doesn't create actual inventory space to store Equipment for the templates, players can actually store their legendaries in Shared Inventory slots and utilize ArcDPS to template equipment configurations across different characters.
---
How do I know? I literally just listened to them. You could try doing the same.
---
dont think teapot left, but ERPs are gone
---
lol
---
One feature. Three times the monetization. I don't feel good about this.
---
That comment is rather toxic, maybe you should cancel your internet or play reddit solo from now on?
---
No, i said to be thankful for the months they allowed you to use arcdps templates.
---
arcdps also didnt give you extra storage slots and you had to re-install it after every update (wow, what convenience).
---
Average GW2 player: "what do you need more than one build for?"
---
The left one looks like a new race.
---
unfortunetly WP joined blind white knights. He is defending every thing gemstore releted as he is getting everything free from his viewers to "help him with master challange". He lost connection to the world and directly ask on every stream to donate shit to him. and is acting sad when no one is giving anything that day.  
---
He love getting donation so much that he wont say a bad world about the game as he know most of these donation come from white knights who blindly love the game so much that they will even pay real money to keep their last streamer happy as they can't afford to lose him.  
---
WP was one on the side of players, on our side, now he is on anet and white knights side. Game can turn into real shit but all he want are more ecto and more black lion keys. He dont care about the game, he is addicted to getting donation, he feel like a god of gw2 community. But in reality he dont even make videos anymore often enough to be called content creator, he become lazy.
---
Thank you for taking the time. It's nice to see it written down somewhere.
---
It's just sad to see what happened to such a great game. At least all the fun I had and friends I made aren't going to shit like the game itself.
---
My point is that some people want enough build templates to cover every variation of thougness and precision of every party setup.
---
Have some restraint.
---
The math is good but basically I won't be using equipment templates as I have my ascended gear in bank and currently I switch manually each time I want to play different game mode. So basically I will need only 2 slots for each character - one for exotic open world build I have just for fun and free slot for equipping ascended gear for meta builds.
---
PS. I "liked" how they avoided question about account bound gear, and FYI  ArenaNet, armory is not good enough for me I will still need my bank with gear in it.
---
From the looks of it, the gear templates took 90% of the dev time. Gear Templates on the other hand are quite basic and extremaly restrictive. Not to mention the false vision of having more build slots without spending money.
---
It looks like they spend more time figuring out how to monetize this, than actually making it possible
---
Did you make a clean install? I had 1.8 before the update and no problem with it
---
This entire topic is also full of "I don't have a problem, quit bitching."
---
there is no problem if you spend 100 euro and use only 4 builds ber character yes. Great game.
---
What an out of place comment .
---
&gt; Extra inventory slots don't matter at all to people who already had huge inventories due to storing gear there and people who share gear among different chsracters.
---
Oh, it does.
---
Actually ANet returned my gems after a not-so-clear item description.. and i got to have my utility after they return my gem!
---
P.S. This is a very long winded post and a specific example, but I hope it will better explain why the Equipment Template system does not favor Legendary Items. This isn't an argument, it is just to help people understand this topic a little more. I just wanted to give some context to this conversation.
---
Thank you for at least reading this part lol. :)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
About the Legendary gear and Equipment Template interaction specifically . . . overthinking it logically, this technically benefits Legendary Armor in a small way. It is a quick swap between different attributes that are common favorites, Berserker's, Marauder's, Harrier's, anything. Quick swapping your Rune and Sigil and different sets of Weapons, all for one character. It has been said "The Armory" being the name of the storage that holds all your gear in the Equipment Template, is specific data to that character. Because it is physical items on your account, It cannot retain a template code (as PogoChoya explained) of these physical items. Again this info cannot be shown or shared to other players or your own characters.
---
I think you might know what I'm hinting at . . . so... I need to point out that Legendary Armor is meant to be fully Attribute and Rune's/Sigil's and Infusion, swap able, that is the reason to obtain it. You may use it in all your Equipment Templates, "Why not it's a great QoL!".----But then . . . It's not going to be pretty when all your Equipment Templates will be deleted (or very empty) when you take a full set of Legendary Gear off your character: As shown in the live stream when you take your Gear out of The Armory that one piece or more if used in multiple Equipment Slots it will remove the item(s) from all Templates they're used in. That's lost prefixes for Attributes and also Legendary Rune's/Sigil's. I'll leave that nightmare to your imagination!
---
The point I'm elaborating on is why the template system cannot fully take advantage of Legendary Gear, this system is better suited for gear that cannot be easily altered, without mistakes or a risk. Like replacing slotted runes with a different rune upgrade, because the new rune will delete the slotted upgrade, or changing the stats of a Ascended item in the mystic forge.
---
The Equipment Template system is perfect for multiple sets of gear and it's also good for Soulbound Item's like Exotic. I think swapping your Ascended gear between characters, like Berserker's with Scholar Runes, you're not going to easily ruin the play ability of both or more characters you'd use that gear on.
---
This is a very narrow example but this is bound to happen to someone and it shall be complained about! But for now. If someone has a different idea or point of view than me, please share. I think it is important to talk about the gave and take of this overall template system and it's really confusing... Thank you for reading. :)
---
Sadly yes. I hope at least they will increase the max limitations from time to time like they do with other storage expansions.
---
Charrtifact*
---
I'm so done with this game.
---
So you mean "If anet will learn anthing from these complaints is, that they should not allowe 3rd party apps because they will probably be better than the implementation from anet directely and players will complain about it and we wont get the money from it we want"
---
Just copied over the top
---
No problem ! I was just worried that I hadn‚Äôt been clear in my comment, and you conveyed what I meant with more clarity.
---
As for equip templates, that‚Äôs a whole other debate I feel, and some valid discussion can be made on that topic. I‚Äôm ok with equip slots being monetized, but I‚Äôm just worried the QoL value of legendary items is a bit taken away. 
---
At least they just alleviated some of that by making it possible to tick a checkbox to change the stats of your whole legendary equipment in one go, instead of one by one.
---
One of the worst classes for pve dps already, now basically unplayable against a huge number of enemies, if someone walks away slowly you lose all your dps with very little you can do about it.
---
ANet's answer will be to nerf every class to have only 2 builds viable, mark my words
---
ArcDPS Build Templates
---
the thing we need to remember is that globaly the part of the community using the cash shop is the "hardcore" part of the community, not the casual one (who still buy, but not on the same scale) so if anet loose this hardcore community (and that is happening) the new players won't compensate for it.
---
And the hardcore community is largely the contents creators for gw2, without them there won't be any new players anymore (as in : a really low number of new player)
---
They have charged for UI features since day 1, why would they change after 7 years?
---
Also, people seem to forget that gems can be obtained without spending any ‚Äòreal‚Äô money
---
I would much rather have the choice on optional upgrades (which we get some of for free anyway) than having to spend money on new maps / story content / etc.  
---
If you truly think it would be better to pay for, let‚Äôs say LW episodes instead then I would point out that this would split the player base considerably, end up costing us more, and be way more ‚Äúrequired‚Äù than a few more build slots
---
We have managed fine without them for 7 years, I think we will be fine with 2 free per toon with the option to get more
---

Stupid or not, it's true.
---
He has some really high quality content (Guides etc..) but outdated I believe don't know if he uploaded new stuff lately.
---
As long as you can have a decently sized pool of equipment templates - and can share the same gear (with different custimization) across them I'm happy.   
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
Sadly having them expensive would be nice for me to have tangible goals to work towards instead of having them slapped on and taking them for granted.

Under EU regulation you can ask for a refund for misleading advertising.

Remember back in 2007 when we had these things for free in GW1, nearly infinite, storagable in strings and the ability to share on the fly?
---
Anet don't care about the hardcore players, why would the casuals?
---
False advertisement, fix this fix this fix this.
---
Just as long as you people keep dancing around and yelling that the game is fine and that everyone should deal with it.
---
??? I don't remember disagreeing with you? I just said that it isn't only Mesmers. Fb also tanks nowadays and sometimes on some encounters even Druid. Also dps classes which switch to other gear based on spotter etc. Besides the encounter specific builds like HK. Isn't this feature only relevant for those people who care about this stuff? Aren't these 1% the people who ANet adresses with this feature? 90% of the players won't care about this with their exotic personal story reward gear.
---
How do you check that?
---
In my whole time raiding someone never told me I should just kill myself or just die. Or that I am the fucking scum of the world ^^
---
And this happened not just once as I started pvp.
---
I think now you're mixing something.
---
You may mean that ppl may be a little elitist, but never as toxic as people in pvp.
---
I found a lot more people willing to help my with raids than people to help me with pvp.
---
It feels completely trash to play.
---
&gt;Or have the manpower to make an expansion AND release a few content updates until the expansion goes live? What if they announce that they will focus on releasing an expansion end 2020, but cannot provide content updates in the meantime?
---
That exact thing happened, twice iirc, and the game's still here. After they announced HoT at the end of LS2, we didn't get any new content until HoT launched 9 months later, and a similar thing happened before PoF, although the wait on that was only 2 months. Some kept playing during the "content drought," while others left, but most of them came back when HoT launched (same with PoF, although most kept playing).
---
Now whether people would stay/return if the same thing happened now is unclear. I feel like Anet's used up a lot of the good will they had before, so people might be less willing to stick around or come back, but I feel the outcome would be similar regardless of whether they have an expansion or just continue down this holding pattern. A good amount of people have lost trust in Anet and see nothing ahead for them besides a few hours of living world every few months, as well as the possibility that their favorite class gets made clunky and unfun to play. Those people probably wouldn't be made more likely to leave than they already are if a content drought for an expansion started, because for many of them, GW2 is in a pseudo content drought. In fact, it's possible that you'd have more returning for an expansion than for another LW episode.
---
Browser version of Reddit shows it. I assume it went up a bit since every criticism to the game gets insta downvoted in new.
---
It's funny how much that sounds like a post about chrono if you replace some words.
---
I recently decided to main ele hard core, may I ask what builds the 6 are?
---
When you whisped them and you regret it, either you were whispering the people I told you to ignore or you behaved the wrong way.
---
Not how that works. Telling people to stop whining is not whining.
---
And people aren't being fed shit. They are being given what they asked for: official build templates. No one has ever whined about having to pay for convenience before so why the crap are they starting now?
---
At this point, the solution might be "special bag that works as extended equipment template storage". 20slot, 32slot, same cost as other bags, insertable into regular inventory slot, basically cutting your inventory smaller, but usable for more templates. 
---
But then....such bag is same 400gems but in gold xD
---
I don't remember, did you get unlimited templates in Guild Wars 1?
---
Slightly unrelated question: Are the arcdps templates safe to use? The readme warns of possible equipment loss and while I 'd love to be able to use them, that's something I wanna avoid at all costs.
---
I think the biggest 'meh' is the fact that these are paid OUTFITS. I would be more interested in Armor sets in gem store than full outfit which I can't mix and match.
---
While I understand your concerns, I think you're making some big assumptions here. I would suggest to leave the pitchfork in the shed until we know all the details.
---
1. We don't know the pricing of the equipment slots yet. 400 gems might be a reasonable guess (more on that in point 2), but if you start drawing conclusions like "semi-hardcore players playing 3 classes for 2 game modes will need to fork out at least 60 USD in gems" you're entering the domain of wild speculation.
---
2. We don't know if equipment slots you buy from the gemstore will be character bound or account wide. In your estimations you're assuming that you need to buy equipment slots separately for each character. The announcement text seems to suggest that, but it's a bit ambiguous on it. The other equipment storage options you based the 400 gem guess on (like bag slot expansion, shared inventory slots) are mostly account wide. If you assume that to be the price it, would be reasonable to assume that they will be account wide. 
---
Now I'm not saying I'm sure Anet won't try to sell character bound equipment template slots for 2000 gems each, I'm just saying that we shouldn't grab our pitchforks prematurely.
---
So I have legendary focus to avoid carrying additional foci with me. After update I either have to not equip it to templates or equip it to templates and carry additional item to blast. What a great design.
---
400 gems to unlock new mastery
---
it can't
---
And just like that, you saved him money.
---
equipping everything else? I mean, If you are in such a need to swap your weapons that much beyond the already available weapon set for most professions then you could just do it like you did before there even where templates. I don't know what you expected really because it should have been clear that it won't fix every "problem".
---
Can confirm 8 frequently used builds on my guard.
---
Yes let's rework an entire system for the 0.001% of the playerbase that blasts might in fractals with different weapons and ignores the trivially easy task of getting another focus for blasting.
---
&gt; the thing we need to remember is that globaly the part of the community using the cash shop is the "hardcore" part of the community, not the casual one (who still buy, but not on the same scale) so if anet loose this hardcore community (and that is happening) the new players won't compensate for it.
---
maybe you didnt register the detonations around you but its exactly those veterans that are complaining right now that they have to spend gems.
---
&gt; And the hardcore community is largely the contents creators for gw2, without them there won't be any new players anymore (as in : a really low number of new player)
---
Players dont buy the game because there is third party content available they buy it to play the game. They cant consume 3rd party content without buying the game. Sure, it helps to make the game more engaging but just because a content creator leaves doesnt mean that their previously released content isnt available anymore. 
---
Dulfy left half a year ago but I reckon her website is still frequently visited by new players looking for guides up to that point and since then, plenty of new websites have popped up continuing her work, so there doesnt seem to be a problem with new content creators popping up.
---
Which is not bad... Could be 3 slots, but I can understand the reason they will give one (it's essentially extra storage for gear).
---
But people are crying about not having enough slots for all the builds they play, when, some of thoose builds only differ on a weapon or one or two assassin pieces over berserker and vice versa, which is ridiculous. Change the small stuff manually, and then go back to the "default" build when you no longer need the encounter/group specific build.
---
The author of the free version made a deal with Anet. The deal was that they will allow his version but as soon as the official build tamplates are out he isnt allowed to update it. His version has to be update after every major patch or its stops working. So its dead after the official version is out.
---
Min maxing is overated and you know it unless you are trying to go for record runs
---
So you've spent hundreds of hours and literally *years* of real time to get legendary armor and now you're being asked to pay fucking money to use it to its full potential.
---
Build and gear templates should be (within reason) infinite, and free.
---
&gt; It's lateral-at-best for the top tier raiders.
---
It takes an exceptionally uncreative person to believe that there aren't people who care about having lots of builds besides raiders.
---
Yeah Shari from TLS, I played there when FSP and UW where linked, thought he was on FSP.
---
I call bs... You crafted legendary gear way before they announced build templates. Don't come with the victim act over that.
---
Or maybe that 39% recognizes that we can't make any assumptions about how much money were going to have to pay if we don't even know the pricing yet. Until we do, it's all just scaremongering and doomsaying.
---
Yeah I noticed that while writing :(
---
Both look like a pile of trash.
---
"You can instantly swap stats and runes on your legendary gear!!!"
---
...
---
"if you pay us money"
---
Curious, do you have any citation for the hardcore players making more purchases?
---
You can use 1 set of legendary runes and armor across multiple equipment tabs for that character.  If you want to use the armor for a different character you have to right click the item and remove it from all templates.
---
I understand the frustrations but at the end of the day I don‚Äôt believe anybody has any right to be upset about Anet‚Äôs implementation.
---
Arc templates is a third party program made by a private individual with no affiliation to Anet. Just because they made build templates first doesn‚Äôt mean Anet should have to make revenue impacting decisions because of it. It would be akin to Skyrim implementing its own version of a popular mod, but doing it better, fully supporting it and charging people for it as an expansion. It‚Äôs their game, and their choice and just because ‚Äòsomeone else did it first‚Äô isn‚Äôt a reason to not try to recoup development cost on a much requested feature
---
Anet‚Äôs implementation is better than Arc‚Äôs; (Gear consume, build sharing, pet/legend swap), Will always work on patch day and honestly is fairly generous without paying money.
---
As I wrote in another post, all those other storage expansions are account wide. Assuming a similar price but then also assuming that they will be character bound would not be "in line with other storage expansion".
---
Now I'm not saying Anet won't do that, I wouldn't even be surprised if they will. But before we know the details we shouldn't be picking up our pitchforks just yet.
---
People just love to set themselves up for dissapointment by denying this.
---
Yeah, it's kinda crazy that the people who wanted the templates the most will not be able to actually use the templates in the way they wanted.
---
What I gather from everything I read:
---
There are three types of templates.
---
- Shared skill/trait templates
---
- Per character skill/trait templates
---
- Gear templates (loadouts)
---
What we get: 
---
- 3 (or rather 6) shared skill/trait templates; buyable until a max of 24(? not sure if 24 or 27)
---
- 0 per character skill/trait templates, but three hotkeys, counting as 3; buyable until a max of 6
---
- 1 Gear loadout, counting as 2; buyable until a max of 6
---
Why?
---
- The shared skill/trait templates are completely new. We fully get those. But I don't see myself using them much, because I have a text editor that can store those unlimited.
---
- The individual skill/trait templates are just your current existing three traitlines; PvP, WvW and PvE. You don't get anything new except being able to switch them with a hotkey.
---
- You get 1 gear loadout because you basically already have one with the stuff you equipped. If you want to switch around a lot of gears, you'll probably continue to keep 1 template as a switch-template and have only one with fixed gear inside
---
What problems arise?
---
- Shared templates? None. But as I said, I don't see myself using them. Maybe as a loadout from some characters, but then 6 would not be enough (neither will 27)
---
- Individual templates? Not much problems here as well, because you can keep your texteditor file. It just doesn't change anything for anyone (if we don't keep arc in mind) playing all three game modes. 
---
- Gear templates? Uuh now this is a stomper. Legendary gear used for a lot of builds? Have fun manually changing them. Ascended gear sharing? Unequip from all your templates before. Legendary gear sharing? Unequipping all, and equipping again and then manually changing the stats each time over again. Shouldn't Legendaries add QoL? 
---
Getting two gear templates is just for having one PvE, one WvW. But heaven forbid we use more than 1 gear template per game mode. (PvP excluded fully here, cause it works differently.)
---
Sure this is fine, for anyone who never needed build templates. Nice QoL addition, not gonna argue. You have a second gear slot.
---
But anyone who was vocal about getting these templates? Massive downgrade from Arc. Gear sharing in arc? No problem. Unlimited skill/traitlines without copy pasting? We had that as well. Unlimited gear blueprints? Of course.  
---
"What about the additional bag space though?" - Anyone who had the need for multiple gear slots already has the needed bag space.
---
I'm not gonna spend a single gem on this feature like this.
---
Two improvment suggestions:
---
- Please make ascended, or only just legendary gear easily shareable without destroying the gear templates. This would be possible if you gave us the option to store gear blueprints (more than 6! Ideally unlimited) in addition to gear loadouts.
---
- Why limit the individual builds? Just sell the ability to bind them to hotkeys instead of the templates themselves.
---
Bag slots are not account wide
---
Yeah. I dodged 2 in a row with careful timing. It should be unblockable... and I main guard but that is kinda funny that aegis blocks it.
---
Let's make *this comment every time*.
---
Good point, corrected it.
---
Character bag slots aren't account wide.  They also said some things would be sold in three-packs only.
---
Lmao nice
---
Corrected it. The three packs was referring to the build templates, and those are confirmed to be account bound.
---
I am casual GW player who has never played so much to feel need of using so many templates. Tbh I've never used templates at all because I play PvE only. I'd be happy to use this new game feature since I wanted to try different builds and this solution is convinient but I can see that many of more hardcore than me players are upset. Could anyone explain to me why this change will be bad for you? Will this change disable your templates addon which you were using earlier?
---
Why not?
---
As I said there is a difference between pvp banter and actual genuine toxicity.
---
No one has ever tried to dox me irl or sent my friend unsolicited nudes in all my time playing in PvP. I don‚Äôt even think I have had anything much worse than insulting my skill at the game.
---
I‚Äôm not saying there is MORE toxicity is raids, I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs much worse stuff that happens.
---
Except condi chrono can do the same as a condi mirage can, this also doesn‚Äôt include wvw, fractals, or openworld... so there‚Äôs 4 more for you to *simplify* into this.
---
If the casuals only pays 5% or 10% of what a hardcore player pays, that's still a shitload of money.
---
It agree, we got one in particular who's copy and pasting his opinion like it's law, while he yips in other threads like an autistic Chihuahua.
---
Bag slots are account wide now! When did that change?
---
I used Scourge in pve. Now I don't.
---
Tested it for 1-2h and there were no problems with tagging in open world (not really a surprise) but when you get to actually fight with anything that moves and placing shades make no sense... Well, in melee Reaper is better, that's all I say.
---
How dare you. Our Commander must be present at every lore-relevant political meeting, marriage, fall-out, minor rebellion. Even if they are happening at the same time. And they all deserve a cutscene!
---
Fixed it. Also, as far as I know bag slots are the only storage expansion purchase that isn't account wide.
---
Lol if you think they are gonna fix it, they have your money already.
---
My mains not long ago: power/boon Chrono and viper/heal Scourge. The amount of salt I can share...
---
This isnt ffxiv
---
He got my downvote not because he is able to express well in the English language, but for assuming he is a semi hardcore player, which in fact is false. He is part of the high class elite lords who have  more than 5 builds and equipment sets for one class. That is absolutely great. However, he/she falls in line with comments such as: I have 20 builds for my ranger alone. Me and my partner are reading the reactions on Reddit and we laugh every day before going to work. It's our little comedy skit. It's hysterical, really.
---
I don't have an issue with them adding clothing to the gem store, but I will never buy any Outfit, and wish that they were armor pieces instead. 
---
The biggest gamechanging overhaul they could do would be to unify the three armor weights, so that pieces are completely interchangeable, so that they could release "Outfits" as fully separatable armor skins.
---
I'd like to point out that the author of arcdps add-on, who had to basically hack the game, implemented this feature just fine in his(her/their) free time. Saying that it may be hard for actual devs with access to documentation and codebase is basically insulting their ability.
---
Okay but that's really not how anything works. They can't tell you exactly how they'll implement something before they've spent a good amount of time working on it. They don't even know just how much they are charging for this, and the key reason they are charging gems at all is because they implemented the equipment builds to clear part of your inventory space, so giving you endless options is like free bag slots. Had they just kept your equipment in your bags, perhaps it would be a different story (or at least gems would be much less justified if the system doesn't save inventory space). 
---
The cap on this stuff is a different story, and my understanding is that it's because of limitations to their system. I'm not sure how that all plays out, because it's really not great to be capped. Stuff like this makes me think that they tried to make their system convenient in one way (absorbing inventory slots) instead of sacrificing a bit of that convenience in favor of giving people more options (e.g. just letting it be a text file that saves locally, like in GW1).
---
I think the issue is more nuanced than that. People may have been happy to pay for a version of templates that is a significant improvement over current free alternatives (eg. With transmutation templates as well, or the ability to share gear across characters). People may even have been happy to pay for something that is equivalent to what arc has now, just with a nicer UI and more stability.
---
The issue now is that many players will lose access to arc, and will likely have to pay a decent sum of money for a large LOSS in QOL. I would say that is a justifiable ground for complaint.
---
Try this: [Dagger/dagger spellbreaker](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PKwAgiJlZwuYWMKWJOSX+veA-zxQYhoDBvD3Tp0SEEYBERCUeIoyA-e)
---
The key of this build is to gain a lot of might, which heals you and gives endurance back. The tooltip says 2 endurance per might stack which doesn't seem like a lot (one dodge is 50 endurance) but I fills up rapidly. [Here are all the might sources](https://i.imgur.com/vXeH5lP.png). With the strenght runes those might stacks will last 50% longer. 
---
I minmaxed the stats to get 80% crit chance, with fury it's 100%. "Sun and Moon Style" in the spellbreaker line heals you for 7% of your outgoing crit damage while using a dagger in the offhand.
---
Interupting enemies gives you ferocity and might, therefore you get rewarded for actually watching the enemy instead of just going hack'n'slay. For more interupts I put a hammer into the second set but you can also go for double axe or greatsword for more raw damage.
---
The adept trait in Discipline can be swapped for the lower one since the only swiftness source is from dagger 5.
---
Spaghetti code is a pretty terrible thing to deal with - I've been a software engineer for 15 years and have seen some pretty bad projects.  Apparently this game was built on the engine that GW1 used so they're dealing with almost two decades of engine changes.  That's a hard codebase to keep under control.  The solution is to refactor the code and clean things up but that's an insurmountable task.  At some point a decision maker has to ask themselves, "do we provide these things that add value and generate money or do we clean house?"  Almost always the first option is the decision.  I know.  I make that call all the time.  :\
---
The studio has limited resources.  If a team went in and tried to surgically fix things then we wouldn't get updates and we'd likely get a more broken product for awhile.  That's just the reality of very large software development efforts.
---
Other studios might not deal with this as much because they're not dealing with such an old engine, or they do and you're not hearing about it.
---
If "shit breaks" that likely involves many players... they are capable of doing a "server rollback", this was evident on Aug 23 2016 with the whole soulbound bug/glitch that screwed up for a large majority of players.
---
TBH this does look stretched. Are you really using all those builds on daily basis?
---
Autoclickers, like the other guy said
---
teapot left as having GW2 as a main game, but he still enjoys GW2 combat system an plays it sometimes or when there is a huge cue to enter WoW servers. Unless he changed his mind lately (I haven't seen his stream in the last 2 weeks)
---
So the partner program is turning into Reddit? ;)
---
You are not receiving a reduced feature, paid or otherwise, because Arcdps was never official and was only barely tolerated.
---
I guess you don't know how the real world works then.  My 12 years experience in software development gives me a good idea on what's going on from a 30,000 foot view.
---
Arcdps templates won't be supported anymore after the official templates release. It's part of the agreement between the guy behind arc and ArenaGems.
---
Even if someone else keeps updating the tool's template functionality (if it will be possible, nobody knows how the game's code will react) you'll just be exposing yourself to the banhammer.
---
they would have to be astronomically incompetent to not be able to implement it as shown by arcDPS
---
Don't be sorry. He's full of shit and it's a red herring argument.
---
I have every legendary on my ele except for sigils. For the price of a single legendary I could've filled all of my gear templates with full ascended.
---
considering the fact that this will now actively compete with the free version you get through Arcdps its easy to assume that Anet will tell them to shut it down.
---
There's really no evidence that the hardcore community is actually paying them well at all. On the contrary, a lot of the hardcore community sink far too many hours into this game which comes at the cost of earning actual money in real life. They also tend to have accumulated a lot of gold, so they can make most of their gemstore purchases like this through gold exchange. 
---
Obviously this doesn't apply to every hardcore player, but in general they aren't the big spenders.
---
Uhuh. Legs are overrated too, why won't you just buy a wheelchair? (Second wheel isn't included in the base package).
---
Thought the same thing. However this would be favorable for people who have a lot of Character slots vs people who do not have a lot of Character slots. For example: it would cost 1000 gems for it. You have 5 Character slots. Would cost you 200 gems per character. If you have 50 Character slots, it would only cost you 20 gems per character. So by paying per slot per character makes it a bit more interesting for all players.
---
The game launched with paid characterer slot, bank slot, inventory slot, transmutation stones then shared inventory slot and material storage expansion. 
---
Paid build template slot is exactly the type of monetisation Anet have been doing since launch. Anyone who's angry about it now is simply a fool.
---
This is... Somewhat less than the full truth.
---
The article compares a mobile 8250U chip, which is ~50% slower than the now *ancient* 6600K desktop chip. Sure thats good on Qualcomm to compete with Intel but its nowhere near a "similar to core i5" real world gaming scenario. And this is of course completely ignoring the GPU - the 8CX chip would have something thats probably worse than Intels HD graphics, the article basicly says "well lets hope for whatever" in the GPU area.
---
And let me tell you, you *do not* want to play GW2 on a core i5 mobile with HD graphics. I tried on a Surface Pro 2 once (which have the comparably fast i5 due to fatter cooling, they didnt match it until like Surface Pro 5 or something?). I nearly vomitted from the nauscea of low fps.
---
He is trying to get everything available in the game, all achievements, skins, gliders,...
---
See! I knew there could easily be a middle man for copy pasting. The equipment obviously is the more concerning one.  
---
There is probably a middle ground somewhere. Arc obviously instantly equips gear... where as the new system has various cooldowns and checks.
---
Ah yes.. monetize what was free in the real guild wars game. I guess this is the type of shit the community should expect since they are not making expansions now.
---
It will get much worse.  I didn't expect them to charge for template or that they'd be limited . In eso and wow I do this free  with addons. 
---
Their decision to go back to crappy small content updates instead of xpacs is going to kill this game. The pvp been dead for ages already.
---
Expansion level features lol... with a price  $$$ may as well just make expansions and not nickle and dime what shouldn't cost anything in the first place. Trash company horrible management.
---
Semi hardcore ?   
---
Maybe hardcore whining.   
---
It's not like you lose the ability to manually kit yourself out.  
---
it's literally ***NOT REQUIRED BY ANY MEANS.***   
---
And reddit, of course, is going to do the reddit thing of thowing a  toddler tantrum over it like Somehow Anet is required legally to bend over backwards and make zero income to appease their desire for everything to be given to them free.   
---
Anet Needs to make money somehow. No expansion money = Monetized QOL ( that's all this is, quality of life, like the fucking copper fed or a 19th character slot ) . Most, if not All, other QOL changes were Monetized in some way or another.   
---
Inb4 " Anet White Knight " for stating the truth about the matter
---
I think its hilarious u kids talking about deroir. u wouldnt say this stuff to him at lan, hes jacked. not only that but he wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes. yall are pathetic lol
---
Do u even play
---
Yeah, let's wait until after they are implemented, have the price tag literally everybody with a brain expected and then start complaining. Except then the counterargument will be "people already bought it for this price, so it would be unfair to them. You should have voiced your complaints earlier, so they could have done something before implementation".
---
It is **absolutely**, without the shadow of a doubt, the correct decision to complain to a company *before* a product is shipped. It is possible that they never planned for the slots to be 400 gems, but 2 thoughts on that:
---
First of all: Their fucking fault! If you talk about pricing, talk about pricing. Don't give this vague "it's gonna be in line with previous products" bullshit. Say "it's gonna be X amount of gems", or shut the fuck up. Making these vague statements only fuels speculation and with a company that has spent the past couple years burning through any and all goodwill they had with their veteran playerbase, speculation is **always** going to end up bad for you.
---
Second of all: You have a PR department. You see threads on the largest GW2 online forum, apart from the official one, popping up, complaining about pricing of a new feature. Unless the speculation is pretty much accurate, or your entire staff consists of inept monkeys, you're gonna get in there and clarify your pricing model. So either the "400-600 gem" price range is pretty much entirely accurate, or Anet is still as good at player communication as freshman college students, pick your poison.
---
The fact that we haven't seen anyone adress these speculations pretty much confirms that 400 gems is either accurate or lowballing it.
---
I know I'm likely a whale and a long time player. 
---
However I have 26 character slots.
---
I have roughly 1 to 2 armors per character. 
---
With 1 exception: I have 2 characters with 3 armors.
---
I would have no problems with 2 or 3 builds per character.
---
It would invalidate the legendary gear a lot, however I have legendaries only on my main and 3 other alts. That's legendary weapons for 3 alts, and legendary armor, back, trinket and many weapons for the main. For all other characters I have dedicated power, condi , heal or wvw characters.
---
However If I could only use 8 builds or 16 builds I'd see problems in this. I expect 50 or so slots in total. Some characters are mainly used as chest openers anyways.
---
I mean, you can call it bs, but I call it a thing I have experienced. Zipping up, backing up, and then downloading and unzipping a folder daily isn't something I want to do. It really isn't. I don't know why wanting my game to just work is bs...
---
There is something wrong with casual players when they continue to gimp this once great game time after time because anet constantly bends over backwards for them leaving everyone else in the dumpster
---
And, apparently, you can't read or comprehend what I just said. Pointing out someone is whining is not whining. Never has been and never will be. If it was, you need to take your own advice and stop whining since you are pointing out I am whining.
---
I had those builds to raid before I quit. Dude quit being an apologist, these are legit builds, most on scs website.
---
its better to play with a guild
---
Speak for yourself, punk. I wasnt that stupid to expect templates not to be monatized.
---
This is wrong. I knew many hardcore whales. But tell yourself whatever you want.
---
Gear and trait templates are separated though, surely you mean 6 gear **and** 6 trait templates per character
---
Oh man, your statements are filled with logic and commons sense. Stop it! :D JK. I appreciate you expressing in this way here. I feel the same. Can't wait for build templates. I am still laughing 4 days after I saw a guy commenting they have like 20 ranger builds. Still cracks me up.
---
That's an interesting point. I'll evaluate that some.
---
From my perspective, I was pointing out that they weren't making rational arguments, but just being angry. If someone walks into a room screaming and shouting insults, it's generally best to ignore whatever they say and calm them down to have a real discussion in a rational way.
---
I bought exactly 1 bag slot for the exact same reason. But since they already compared it to bag slots and implemented it in the way they did, it will function similar to a bag slot and would devalue bag slots if 1 slot would be sold account wide and not per character.
---
In an ideal world I would suggest having 2 versions, 1 that stores the gear and is costly and 1 that just links the items to a build. But I assume there won't be any big changes to on how things will be implemented and that is why I did some adjustments to make the best out of the current situation.
---
They said on livestream "it would be in line with other expanders" so we are looking at around 400 to 500 gems
---
That's some expension level price ! 
---
We understood you, anet
---
Anyone have a chance to run Heal Scourge? I started playing that in fractals a few months back, and really grew to like it.
---
I know right.. how have I not learnt by this point. New feature = "can we monetize it?"
---
It was done, albeit with caveats, through a free and approved third party plugin.
---
This games cash shop is pretty excessive as is. Things keep stacking on top of each other, so it can get pretty annoying.
---
QoL features are monetized in gw2 since day one. Expecting the most requested to be free is naive.
---
Aye and that arrogance will make you a pain in the arse to work with. 
---
Catch yourself on.
---
&gt; and an unlimited amount of expansion
---
Which, in all likelyhood, is coming at a later date. From a technical standpoint there is pretty much no reason why you should cap it at 6, since, ideally, this should be information that can be stored in a couple string variables. The most likely reason they capped it at 6 is the same reason they initially capped shared inventory slots at 5: Easy sales boost for future quarters.
---
What's the livestream. They said gem prices will be "inline with other expanders"
---
They didn't say if extra unlocks are account bound or char bound though. So expect the worst as the swirved that one :)
---
so will they ban ppl for using arcdps or what
---
&gt;then there would be no solution that could possibly satisfy you.
---
Pretty sure unlimited, locally saved templates in a folder you can set a path to ( or at least in a separate folder within the game files ) would satisfy literally everyone, since you can point Google drive and other cloud based storage to a folder to sync it even on other PCs. I'm willing to bet my genitals that you would not find a single person dissatisfied by the ability to save their own templates.
---
&gt; we've all been asking for build templates here on Reddit
---
and the most common form those requests took was the "shut up and take my money" meme
---
My personal feelings are that it just isn't worth taking. Maybe if you are dead set on taking minions, but I don't use them apart from flesh wurm. DM is fine in open world pve though.
---
For scourge and Reaper, there are hard choices on what to give up to take blood magic. 
---
Maybe if I had to take it on scourge I would drop soul reaping for Death Magic, but then give up on marks being unblockable and giving life force, and fear giving life force. It would lead to problems getting life force. On Scourge I can live with losing dhumfire.
---
For Reaper maybe some pople will like it but for me both blood, and curses are ahead defensively. Curses just because of enfeebling shroud alone. Axe does a lot of vuln which gives decent stacks, and shroud 4 will get you close to 25 stacks alone.
---
Since the sand shade change I have been messing with core condi necro in pvp with curses, and soul reaping. It is then a choice between spite for more corrupt and might, blood for condi management and some heals, or Death Magic. I blood magic is still better for sustain than Death Magic.
---
From messing with it when in combat it seems stacks average about 10 -15 stacks, which isn't really enough to make enough difference. I haven't been proccing the 25 stacks to get pulsing protection enough to really consider it relevant. If it was easier to proc the protection then I would consider it pretty good and competitive.
---
I am curious if we may see some minion bombers in pvp, but on core necro I can have 3 or 4 condi transfers, so I would be standing in their poison clouds on purpose.
---
I think it was designed badly. The whole traitline revolves around Corrupter's Fervor to get enough stacks. I think Corrupter's Fervor should have been a minor trait replacing armoured shroud. If you don't take apart from minions it is worthless. 
---
I think they are really tentative in making anything to op on necro now. Just looking back on the offhands rework they really seem to lowball the power levels of new stuff. Maybe after Scourge just after POF they are scared of making big balancing problems further down the line.
---
This is in pvp, where I have to kite a lot so maybe different in pve. I will leave it to others to weigh in on pve. If the 300 power from max stats adds dps compared to other builds then it could get some use, but obviously the toughness is a problem in group pve for tanking.
---
I believe the playbase is doing more than enough already .
---
Kind of missing the nuances of the problem here.
---
Legendary armor is locked behind raids though. If it weren't for that, I wouldn't care at all. But it is like that, so I care a little bit.
---
These limitations will make the game look like those shitty f2p limits you see around regardless of if you bought stuff or not
---
&gt; I mean saying the questline doesn't suck...is exaggerating.. 
---
Dude you asked, I gave my thoughts and you're basically saying I'm wrong?  
---
Really?  
---
&gt; why do we need to reach level 80 to have a mount 
---
Because the content where they take place is post 80. Kinda clear as day there.   
---
Look, if all you wanted to do was bash the mount system... don't hide it behind a dumb survey and then act like this.
---
You have to consider the vet GW1 mindset though. It actually didn't even cross my mind (and I know many others in the same mind-set as myself) that they'd even think about monetizing templates. I started playing GW1 when I was 11 so for me, this feels like the final straw.
---
Idk, I do need Build Templates to be able to switch between PvE Gear and WvW gear on a character, or 2 versions of WvW gear. And Im sure plenty of people do. Build templates being designed for a small minority isnt exactly how Anet operates, they design them for the average joe (though that being said, Legendary gear should just have its own, unlimited gear loadouts. The amount of people who have it are small enough to not hurt Anets bottomline, it would make legendary gear more attractive and would satisfy the most hardcore of players).
---
I dont mean to be rude,  but perhaps you should have watched the livestream before writing this. Check my comment to OP you replied too üëçüòò
---
No, they should've had this feature in their games \*years\* ago, so there wouldn't be a need for a hacky version fo the feature that was highly enough in demand to exist. Lets not forget GW1 had build templates.
---
The only reason you perceive this as a loss of qol is that arcdps templates exists.
---
Arcdps templates exists because ArenaNet made an exception for something that would otherwise have been a clear violation of the TOS. They wanted to do something nice for the players.
---
Throwing a fit about this is sending a clear signal to ArenaNet that goodwill from their side will be immediately forgotten and can turn against them quickly.
---
\&gt; years later 
---
This part is kind of key to the issue.
---
This is why you don‚Äôt buy gems , I have played GW since the start ... I have never seen a greed like this from GW and now it‚Äôs all pay for x if you want y .
---
Ya know what.. I'd happily pay up to $50 for unlimited templates. However, **I am not** playing this micro-transaction mini-game where I have to buy slots individually for specific characters. I chose to vote with my feet.
---
This is gw2 though, different game from different times. Its time to stop romanticizing gw1 times, they are gone.
---
From mechanical standpoint, gw2 templates offer more than gw1 counterpart. Major thing is freeing inventory space.
---
People like you are the main reason we went from cosmetics-only microtransactions to whole features in microtransactions as the norm in the gaming industry within 10 years. You people disgust me.
---
Traitline's still pretty bad even post rework. It's interesting and has some flavour but toughness is just simply undesired. And in most end game content there aren't enough adds for the Death Nova trait to work in your favour. It doesn't have very many good synergies with other trait lines, it's middle tier traits are boring, or force you into a minion centric build which minions as they are are too weak to consider. It's only hope is WvW or an elite spec that can synergize with it. The Putrid Defense is one of the more interesting traits increasing poison damage but necro actually doesn't have a lot of poison application tools by comparison to other classes that have poison as well.
---
&gt; If Anet will learn anything from these complaints it is that they will take a hard look at future 3rd party apps that offer convenience and think twice to allow them in the first place.
---
This is likely the take away for them after this I gotta agree. I would assume that in the future if this sort of thing comes up again and there is even a slight chance that they'll implement 'a thing' in the future they'll make sure there isn't a third party app for it.
---
Anet will make sick money on templates. With or without you.
---
I guess because the dude has gone full-autismo and thinks having eight build templates, eight sets of ascended gear for minor stat variations on a single character is anywhere near average or relevant.
---
We'll see how the paying part goes. Most people probably didn't even think about build templates that much, while the people who have been using 3rd party hacks to use them either are either full-blown whales or haven't paid at all.
---
Speculating here but since we'll be able to link build templates in chat, we'll be able to save an "infinite" number of builds here just like we did in GW1. It'll just be less convenient to do 'cause you'll have to copy/paste the template code manually versus the save/load feature on GW1. The code might even be hidden which means someone will need to data-mine for the codes and make a 3rd party app for generating the build template code.  
---
The only issue will be equipment templates because we wont be able to link those, making it impossible to save externally. This is actually the more important part of templates since we only get a default of 2. Even if you simplify your gear setup, you would still need 3-4 equipment templates; power, condi, harrier being the most common ones.  
---
Another thing that bothers me is; how will rune swapping work on non-legendary gear? You technically need an extraction tool for those. If you store the same set with different rune setup, will it require extraction tools? I have no idea how this will work.
---
That‚Äôs how it was with GW1, if I recall. Stored locally in a txt file I think? Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, anyone. I always found this out by accident on fresh installs where I‚Äôd lose all my builds.
---
I know many casual whales. See where this leads?
---
Downvoted because OP's assumptions and math behind them seems far-fetched. I have issues with build templates, but complaining about gem cost of convenience feature in b2p game without sub is just ridiculous.
---
The heal is way too strong. It needs to be d20+10 at best, and maybe changed to once per long rest. A cleric healing someone for 40% of the cleric's HP on short rest is insane. They need to roll for it. Wizard free spell needs be level 1 or 2 at most, else you're giving them a free level 6 spell every short rest. 
---
The downed state is worded poorly. What does "roll a death save with no downside" really mean? I think you mean "roll a death saving throw. Failing does not count against your failed death saves" or something like that.
---
&gt;The other option is to copy the build to a text file on my desktop and use that. ;)
---
And the consumer friendly option would be using a locally stored plain text file with references to your gear, accessible without needing to alt tab out of the game to do things in game.
---
i could have spent time explaining why data has a cost in terms of designing and mantaining but this is not the point. they decided for a limited amount of build which is probably what most ppl use according to their statistic. everyone below that number will never use . who needs more will pay. but this is not the point agin. you all had been saying i'l like this feature even if i had to pay. now you have and you want for free. 
---
really...
---
Make another character, dumbass.
---
I'm not romanticising anything. This **is** how the franchise used to be. Like the use of that word in your sentence is just wrong.   
---
The funny argument about "saving inventory space" is that for 400 gems, or less during a sale (like the one we just had), you can literally unlock a bag slot which will hold equal to **or more than** a whole gear-set. Even though the QoL is nice, its just not nice enough to warrant paying. I could use arc templates to equip the gear straight from my expanded back-pack... It's just a load of rubbish. Even the content creators are tweeting at the developers because they are unhappy with the update as it stands. Do you want links to tweets?
---
You don't need the /s there.
---
&gt; Ya know what.. I'd happily pay up to $50 for unlimited templates.
---
In other words you say "I'd happily pay less money for more stuff".
---
Gemstore.
---
Yes this, please. Otherwise my leggy armor has been crafted for nothing
---
If you are not a fan of any other content the expansions will not really give you much besides elite specs.
---
The game also allows you to buy legendary runes and sigils, the price for Gold 2 Gems stopped being reasonable long ago. 400gems isn't far fetched at all, maybe a bit too low but we'll see.
---
actually i'm a veteran since i had been playing since day one. and i am a "casual" according to you since i do not raid (even if i do wvw, pvp and pve (fractals and all but raids).
---
so no i did not left nor did many others. the only ones leaving are the elitist pro or supposed pro-. good luck in other games. actually the game is perfect for who need to play in a open world fanasy map and relax without having to coexist with toxic players (well not too many). if u find another game like gw2 i'd like some suggestions . (plz no wow classic...lol)
---
Until their game dies off due to individual bad decisions they make over time which drive people away from their game. They have no idea the longevity GW2 could have achieved and the resultant revenue from it.
---
Merch
---
and btw since the game is so easy why the fuck do you need 12 builds and 24 equips ? why are you still here? can i have your stuff when u are leaving ?
---
Outfits and chairs.
---
&gt;Will this change disable your templates addon which you were using earlier?
---
That's exactly it. Anet and the ArcDPS devs agreed a while ago that they'd be allowed to have build templates be a feature in ArcDPS until Anet officially implemented their own template system, and then ArcDPS would stop updating that part of the add-on, which would effectively disable it (ArcDPS needs to be updated after most patches so it'll still work with the new version, so not updating build templates means they stop working).
---
Yeah it is. There are equipment and build template folders that are loaded in the client
---
Why should I care about content creators whining? Nike whines all the time about everything, teapot lost relevance after leaving to wow and deroir... Im not sure he is even making content anymore. I dont see how some random dudes from Twitch are relevant argument.
---
If you dont like templates, dont buy them. I dont see issue here. Most of you whiners will cave in anyway, once you go through 5 stages of grief.
---
It is not, you can get it in pvp and wvw aswell
---
Cool, just quit
---
Hahaha and you do? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
I had hope that there would be more interesting gameplay involving the minions, but I don't think the devs want to go in this direction (not blaming them or anything, I think they have good reasons to not go down this route).
---
At this point, I just want the minions to be turned into the guardian's spirit weapons, where you click on the skill, the minion is summoned, does its attack, and then disappear. Maybe then they can be used more often/the gamplay would be more interactive.
---
I think it'd be better if we could just use our gear from our inventory if it had to be limited amount slots and after payment wall.
---
What do you need a build for? I just put on traits I like the picture of, and same with skills. I don't care if they work together or not /s
---
Kind of unrelated but is it worth using Virtues for DH at all? I feel like Radiance and Zeal always have advantage.
---
Gemstore merch
---
&gt;eight sets of ascended gear for minor stat variations on a single character is anywhere near average or relevant.
---
1. Legendary Armor
---
2. If you care about your class and remotely care about the different game modes that's pretty common it isn't like ascended gear is especially rare or something, you get it thrown at you in Raids and Fractals.
---
&gt;3rd party hacks
---
Hacks... lmao
---
AAAAHHHHHH!!!üéâüéäüéâüéä
---
Yes please
---
Aren‚Äôt veterans also the ones who have a tons of gold? Can‚Äôt they convert into gems? Seems to me a good gem sink for whales
---
Unlike you, I'm not actually mad. I am simply disappointed. Why would I go through grief when I hardly play the game? I just want to make crystal clear the depths of anets fall from grace.
---
Hey look, more bitching
---
How much is the upper limit exactly?
---
Most people with a brain do, yes.
---
Why are people still arguing about build templates now that we know we're getting them? Are they expensive af?
---
Best idea I've heard all day!
---
&gt; "We need to make money to keep the game going and we're not asking you for a subscription fee ~~and you don't need templates any more than you need the other convenience items in game~~ ***so we are going to make your experience as miserable as possible, but just miserable enough a calculated % of players will end up paying enough IRL money to make the misery go away and keep us afloat***so...?"
---
FTFY. Im new to the game and I have never seen a community in other online multiplayer game I've played so defensive about the company's anti consumer practices.
---
a new glider and a chair
---
You won't be able to use ArcDPS' templates anymore after the update. The arc devs and Anet agreed it's okay for arc to have templates until Anet officially implements them, and then they have to remove them (more accurately, stop updating them, since most patches require ArcDPS to be updated or else it won't work at all, so the templates feature won't work even if you kept the old files).
---
how you want me to enjoy them if they are behind heavy paywall friend? And I wanted to enjoy them..
---
&gt; Unlike you, I'm not actually mad. I am simply disappointed.
---
No, you're actually whiny and entitled.
---
I mean, nr 2... that is what is fun about raids though. Its a 10 man -group- content, and one of the fun things is being able to change gear, traits and even classes because the group needs something else to be able to handle the encounter. Is it that maybe you assume dps players can only do dps?
---
Was about to say this, GW2 is easy to play dynamically. **Solo**! The moment other players show up I'm reminded yet again why I finally threw the towel a few months back and went with FF14 instead. At least they made their engine aware of what this weird newfangled "graph-X cart" or something is.
---
If I have a power warrior for example that has 2 power builds, 2 condi builds and 1 support type build, that shared power and condi armour sets but variations on runes, infusionstraits, skills etc,  I wouldn't have enough template slots. 
---
It would be cheaper for me just to buy a new char slot and have 2 warriors and obtain the extra slots for that char.
---
So although me expecting them unlock account wide is delusional n your opinion, in my opinion its not cost effective if they were released "inline with other expanders cost" as they stated on livestream. 
---
If they are char bound I'm not going to throw a hissy fit, il just work around the issue by spending as little gems as possible.
---
6... 3 personal builds.. but 2 equipment.  You can upgrade both to 6 each.
---
&gt; the grind/cost is too high for me and many other players.
---
The current solution already works for most of the non-hardcore players, and that's why it was the way they picked. Those who actually optimize as heavily as they say in reddit threads do so for playing challenging modes which give out a lot of gold as well as natural progress towards legendary gear, thus they have the money to craft it.
---
So by expansion level features they just meant the price?
---
It all started when those damn Charrs attacked ascalon.
---
is there a meme I'm not aware of?
---
Thanks :D  I think that's one of the enameled dyes, perhaps Emblaze? I'd need to double check
---
Not only that, but how many of those builds are just changing one single trait or one weapon? Stuff like that doesn't need a quick loadout.
---
Allow me to explain, and it's not just that only raiders use lots of builds. 
---
First let's clarify: I don't consider the build template part (skills/traits) to be a limiting factor. Plain text files will be fine, and swapping individual skills and traits is easy anyway for small changes. You don't need a full build template to alter one trait or drop in one utility skill. So, we're just talking equipment templates here. 
---
High level raiding takes the most min-maxing of any game mode, with the possible exception of WvW. While someone at my level of raiding is just happy to find a DPS or support build that works and tweak it very slightly between encounters, I see speed runners in statics who tweak their entire setup in between bosses. That definitely seems like it'd be easier to do with arcdps templates, where you could just label every little tweak by boss name and then forget all the little fiddly stuff you did. Doing that with equipment templates sounds like it'll be expensive or impossible, and raiders will have to either stick with stats or they'll need to do the fiddly changes themselves in between bosses. 
---
Meanwhile, if I'm running power in PvE, I'm running my power set. I'm not going to bother micromanaging my infusions to optimize based on whether or not I have a warrior nearby with a banner or a ranger with Spotter. I can't do that with arcdps right now anyway because of the lag on equipment changing, even if I wanted to or could control my environment enough to reliably have those buffs, which I absolutely cannot do. Optimizing for personal buffs is really the only way to go, and consider any other buffs extra. That drastically limits the number of ways that I need to think about slightly tweaking my gear in general PvE, even if I'm trying to be optimal.
---
Also, raiders are more likely to have legendary armor. Legendary armor seemingly does not benefit as much from the equipment template functioning as a secondary storage mechanic, because you already are saving yourself those inventory slots via your legendary swap. So while I can swap between my heal and DPS sets on my guardian and save myself an entire bag slot doing so, someone with legendary armor is just going to get the automatic stat swap. More benefit to me means the downside is offset more than it is for you. 
---
Lastly, as I intimated before, raiders are the most likely group to have downloaded arcdps before. It's a dps monitor first and foremost, and I kinda doubt most players have even heard of it if they weren't looking for a dps monitor in the first place. It's also an external add-on that requires more than a little dedication to figure out how to use it. I'm not saying it's hard...but it's not pretty, and it takes a bit of figuring out how to download and operate. Obviously I don't have usage statistics, but considering how key the baseline functionality is to raiding (and how irrelevant it is to other game modes), I don't think I'm off-base here. This means that, for many players, the comparison is not between ANet's templates and arcdps, it's between ANet's and nothing. Obviously, ANet's system is a straight upgrade for anyone who never used arcdps.
---
Anet would like to thank you for paying your subscription money
---
A pigeon? A dragon? A repair anvil? A toaster PC?
---
So let me get this right: You prefer being limited to 3 slots/character with paid slots after that, to spending 10 minutes once for every computer you use to set up cloud sync/no time setting up cloud sync if you only play on one computer for infinite slots/character?
---
He probably won't care and will just pay for the templates.
---
Every side project they were working on has been cancelled. They are working on GW2 we just had the prologue to the Icebrood Saga in September, yesterday there was a balance patch, Halloween is likely to be released in 2 weeks and last till the early weeks of November with the release of build templates releasing on the 29th of October. Then its likely episode 1 of the for Icebrood saga with Wintersday in December obviously between episode 1 and Wintersday there'll likely be small patches like bonus weeks and current events. Then there will likely be no patches till January which could be episode 2 of Icebrood Saga or the new years festival. Then after that for GW2 we don't know all we do know is there are 4 content teams with team 1 having worked on the prologue, team 2 on episode 1, team 3 on episode 2 and team 4 on we don't know what. There I hope you can see whats likely coming up obviously it could change I'm only 100% confident about Halloween in October and Wintersday in December. I could have taken the cynical route and gone "oh Anet aren't developing for GW2 anymore they just care about the gemstore" but seeing as how I believe that is the biggest bunch of bullshit I have ever heard I am not going to do that.
---
Well I think that's the biggest thing: they've been using this third party hack for free and now they have to pay to get that functionality. They've known it was coming but now that it's imminent, cue the rrrreeeeeeeeee.
---
Personally, provided the pricing is reasonable, I think this is *great*. The way they're rolling it out will give greater functionality and QoL to a ton of users at no added cost, and gives them another form of totally optional monetization that for a change is aimed at hardcore players who actually consume a lot of ANet's development man hours instead of whales being fed a constant stream of pretty cosmetics to fund content for the hardcore end.
---
Don't want to pay gem prices you feel are outrageous? Awesome. Don't buy slots. You can still do everything you could with the slots, it'll just take a few minutes. It's just a convenient time saver, pure and simple, and ANet can and should make money from the demographic who uses their game the most and who wants this feature the most.
---
I don't they think they will change automatically and instead you will have to change it yourself, through the hotkeys given or smth.
---
My guess (as a fellow GW2 noob) is that:
---
* Elite specs allow you to take entirely different roles. Sometimes you just want to play a Condi Mirage instead of your usual Support Chronomancer, and they're all Mesmer builds.
---
* Sometimes those roles aren't that clear-cut. You could have a tank (high toughness and vitality) but also with healing or condition capabilities, which you can tweak as the team or encounter needs.
---
t4 or cms+t4?
---
t4 only with shit groups that have unreliable comps: take the hit via your build, not your gear.
---
cms+t4: play optimally.
---
For now it seems... there's definitely room on the top of the hero panel for more tabs so it's possible we might see more in the future.
---
To be fair the one on the right looks a lot more comfortable than the left one. There's even a place for your tail to go.
---
Agreed! Would love the logo as a decal!
---
About an optional financial support for a completly free addons whitelisted by ArenaNet. Get yourself new glasses bro.
---
that doesnt make it less of a dickmove
---
There's many ways to fix that. Like making the aegis pulsing for 3s instead permanent.
---
Just T4, I wouldn't do CMs until I had more gear.
---
So you're saying (in T4) use Scholar and just change the build to generate might?
---
it's not a dickmove at all
---
and so my response is relevant, sis
---
You don't have legendary gear, so you can't even hypothetically consider the value of a feature that would incentivize players to strive for legendary gear by playing the game that they enjoy?
---
The biggest limitation will be equipment templates.  As you cannot create chat links for those.  Builds that can be shared between personal and account build storage by simply copying and pasting chat links will have an unlimited amount since you can put them in a text file, or personal guild motd.
---
Judging from the names and thumbnails of his twitch videos, he seems to have streamed slightly over 43 hours of GW2 over the last 15 days.
---
Care to explain?
---
I just have a character per armor weapon set..... the change doesn't bother me much.
---
They managed to make the issues with scourge and necro in general worse.
---
It's worse in PVE, worse in PVP and better in WVW. The exact opposite of what they wanted to achieve. (Or atleast what the aim should be). 
---
I can only conclude from this that anet isnt capable of balancing. They do not understand what makes their classes strong in any of the gamemodes.
---
Mind you if they didnt change the target cap they might have the desired result in atleast one gamemode. If they relocated power in the right ways (I.e. single target) rather than the most retarded ways (I.e. target cap) they could have actually improved things.
---
But by doing the opposite they've only shown that after more than a year of them investigating the issues with shade functionality, they STILL dont understand what makes it problematic or how to fix it.
---
Next attempt in a year?
---
But how does that matter?
---
Sure, since the beginning we knew they would make their own system eventually, but it doesn't change the fact that their system is far, far worse for people who play a lot of different Builds on the same character.
---
These people will have their current flow in the game completely changed, for the worse, that's not a concern that you can brush off with "you knew we were doing our own templates, not our fault that Arc is/was so much better"
---
6 builds? Sure.
---
6 builds requiring drastically different equipment setups? That would mean that you think everyone is running around with 6 sets of armor, or multiple infusion and rune sets in their inventories. That's just...not normal. I understand it's normal in raiding for optimization, but that's because you can absolutely control your environment and what buffs you're receiving from your group. For most people, it'll be sufficient to have their power set, their condi set, and maybe their support set. 
---
Skill builds are different, but not only are those pretty easy to swap anyway, they can also be stored as text files. That limitation is far lighter than the equipment builds.
---
Except the templates were not  a part of the game. ArcDPS introduced it, but it wasn't meant to be in the game up until now. So right now, you are crying about Anet implementing a new QoL change only because you were using external program that had no such limitation, which makes no sense at all. As per game Design until now you were SUPPOSED to swap the gear and traits manually. 
---
I have multiple builds on my toons, using multiple gear, and I was not using ArcDPS template. When I had to switch the gear I was just doing it manually. And I never had problems with that.
---
Man for once I agree with someone called Boris. But I do agree with people upset about it. I find the "oh but ArcDPS gives it us for free" argument idiotic as Anet is a business that needs to make money to pay their 200+ employees however I hope they see this back lash and they monetise the side tabs where you save templates but all 6 tabs for build and equipment storage are made free and then they can release new tabs through patches. But yes the hypocrisy of people saying they'd pay for build template and yet they are getting them for free but need to pay for tabs is not lost on me.
---
All this outrage does send a very clear message to ArenaNet though: Never ever allow any sort of 3rd party tool if you are planning on implementing the functionality yourself. Because it seems like basically all the complaints is about: "arc did it better!!".
---
Please stop pretending this is 'goodwill'. They're a corporation trying to pull a profit.
---
Did you update your Windows? Their are reports that since then some windows user have performance problems.
---
Look at how many trolling ppl are here XD
---
None know what anet doing but from what we know the second project was abandoned. Now all teams work on Gw2 expecially on a full living story with expansion like content (aka saga), the rework of wvw, the Swiss tournament for pvp with off season 2v2 1v1 and other things. 
---
For what I understand, Anet changes to gw3 only when Gw2 engine don't allow at teams to work on new contents. ( like was already appended with gw1).
---
&gt;because let's not be kidding here, it's not the casual players that make the bulk of the cash shop transaction
---
X: Doubt
---
Even if raiders bought gems at a rate 10x higher than casual players (which I think is ridiculous, considering how important fashion wars is to everyone, not just raiders), there is no way that the hardcore raiding population is even 1/10 that of the general population.
---
Yeah this is the economic limit switch here: at a certain point, it's more cost effective to split your 47 mesmer builds that you demand free templates for but are never gonna get...and just add character slots.
---
You're gonna get 3 build and 2 equipment slots per character slot, so that is, one way or another, going to put a soft cap on what they can charge for packs of template slots.
---
Cause you can just send it to yourself in 10 seconds. You could even post it to discord and copy it from there. It's that simple and takes no effort whatsoever. Besides who uses 3 computers on a daily basis AND changes several templates majorly? 
---
But yeah with the new system instead of saving every build you instead have to redo everything. Sounds way more useful and less time consuming than sending it around with the easy of a link. /s
---
on the other hand, anet's templates are exactly what I wanted them to be, especially that they free my inventory from carrying multiple gear sets
---
Funny, you dont WANT to play any pvp gamemode yet here you are telling us how WVW should work and be managed.
---
Keep in mind virtually all resources go to your gamemode you're whining about and yet... the game hasn't grown. It has only declined. Anet does what you ask. None of the pvp modes or raids ever received a fraction of casual openworld resources. Go buy some gems to support them. They need it.
---
NA only rip
---
Not at all.
---
Pathetic and desperate is what it is and it's not the sign of a company going strong. It's all so backwards.
---
They are monetizing QoL features but not actual content besides expansions and when you are too late for LS. I seriously don't get it how we ended up like this.
---
All I know is that I stay the fuck away from any game that monetizes QoL because it's the most anti-fun you can put in a game.
---
The account storage builds do not work for equipment, rendering then mostly useless.
---
6 slot for a single character is more than enough for quite everyone
---
if you give me the jpeg/png, ill make you guys a vector / svg
---
Spend gems on build templates ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
While i agree that they are way overpriced for what they offer, the number is fine for casual players like me who at most have ~3 different builds per class.
---
I guess the pricing would be alot fairer if they got progressively cheaper the more you own eg 400-&gt;300-&gt;200 gems per slot.
---
For now its probably best to just put the most frequently used builds into the slots and do the less frequently used ones the old manual way.
---
The point of Templates is to be able to store multiple builds in a single character. If it's so restrictive and expensive that it forces you to create more characters to have more builds ready to use, then it failed its purpose.
---
I like it.  People with legendary gear wouldn't have to worry about being limited to so many equipment templates.  Meanwhile people with Ascended armor would have to buy more tabs.  It still brings in sales for ANet while giving an incentive for players to get legendary armor.
---
You are angry at everyone who disagrees with you. Its fruitless as a result.
---
You'll simply wait until you can "discuss" with people agree with you, then use that to validate your arguments and how you argue. 
---
At no point did I presume to know you. I only based myself on the words and actions you wrote here. You can outline where you disagree but j expect you wont.

[This blog post](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/) remains pretty close to what we knoe they're working on. Just remove what's since been released and add Living World Season 5 aka The Icebrood Saga. For a more up to date list that is kept up to date see [this list on the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Upcoming_changes_and_features).

Guild Wars 3 is unlikely to be a thing in development for years still, especially given the layoff fiasco early this year. They were working on a Guild Wars mobile game (no, not a conversion of GW1 or GW2 into mobile), but Ncsoft forced ArenaNet to end all in-development projects for the sake of getting immediate profits with the layoffs. There was also an undisclosed secobd project in development, our best hints imply possibly a console title. These two projects were likely the original focus for the PAX stream that became a fiasco and major disappointment last month.
---
Team 4 its possible aren't a living world team for this simple fact why not just say team 4 is working on episode 3.
---
They are working on another poorly thought piece of content that will be relevant for 3 days.
---
Or they could just make something better than a 3rd party tool made by some random guy made in his bedroom?
---
You severely overestimate the amount of agency employees have when controlled by management. The audience isn't adverse to good will, because there isn't actually any good will in the first place. This is a business decision designed to bring in as much profit as possible, period. 
---
Arenanet will only respond to profit. If people rejecting this current iteration of the system has a tangible impact on profits, then it will change. The employees aren't children who act based on their emotions getting hurt, they act based on what their management tells them to do.
---
Is this FFXIV ?
---
To graze or not to graze, that is the question:  
---
Whether it's nobler of the cattle to suffer   
---
the yokes and prods of outrageous monetisation,  
---
or take up our horns against a sea of greedy devs  
---
and by opposing them change them?
---
Moo, I say!
---
I just think build templates is going to be put out as a version 1.0.. and they will add on to it based on feedback.
---
Its pretty much in line with everything else they've done. Bags, Storage expansions, Bank Tabs, Shared Slots. Many QoL features are locked behind the gem store. And as with all of those, they could expand the cap limit in the future.
---
Pasta code is just Anet desire to underpay core programmers. They lost best coders a while ago due to noncompetitive wages. They do not want to invest into software/tool development. Why the fuck they would do that when they can do cashgrab on core features and when people ask "where the content is?" they just "Spagetti code peppehands bru"
---
Let's not forget that GW1 build templates are nowhere near to GW2 implementation. And could never work with GW2 systems, especially those we had on release.
---
Dude you aren't meant to give a serious answer its clear they don't care about GW2 they are lying about working on GW2 and they are just making gemstore stuff. Obviously I'm being sarcastic.
---
&gt;Anet whiteknights are really sucking hard on their dicks now lol.
---
When have they ever not?
---
Surely the message is that professionals working on their own game for years should probably have managed to produce something superior to a third party tool created by a hobbyist in their spare time?
---
I think the "realistic" QoL of legendaries is to be able to adapt to different meta without any cost. People pretending it has something to do with templates are using a victim card, because legendary stat swap was a thing waaay before templates were announced and people crafted it anyway. But I do agree that build templates could have been a great opportunity to add that extra QoL to it.
---
As for the amount of slots, wasnt the shared inventory slot also limited and they kept.increasing it? Iirc it was, and I have a feeling it will be the same case here, from a monetization standpoint it makes no sense to limit sales at the end of the day... There's that.
---
I'm just opposing to people who are demanding 10 slots for free for their "various needs" when the needs are in fact just a change of stats in 1 or 2 armor stats and a choice of weapon, either do that manually or pay for the fact that you can't be bothered to loose 1min of your time.
---
As I said somewhere else, the only solution to keep everyone happy, is to still allow use and updates of arcbuilds untill Anet can provide a equal product, just don't expect it to be free, because at the end of the day they need and should make money, it's a business after all.
---
I know that I'm going to eat downvotes for this, but the two main factors are that a) people hate change and b) people hate being unable to control their situation. This is why you'll have people claiming that the sky is falling before every single change in every patch - hyperbole, but you get the point. 
---
In the current situation, players with a billion different builds are seeing that their current solution to build templates, arcdps, is being taken away and are automatically assuming that the Anet solution is worse when we honestly haven't even gotten to play with the templates yet and I haven't seen anything from the devs of arcdps about not being interested in continuing their project after new templates go live. 
---
There's a *lot* of assumptions going around right now. Same as before any major change.
---
&gt;For what I understand, Anet changes to gw3 only when Gw2 engine don't allow at teams to work on new contents. ( like was already appended with gw1).
---
This will pretty much be the case. ArenaNet will milk GW2 for all its worth, and will only make a GW3 when a) they finish the Elder Dragon story entirely (we're only halfway folks! If that!), or b) when the engine cannot support the desires of the core content ANet wants to add for the next story.
---
Most likely it'll be when both a and b occur.
---
Bruh my shit's souldbound ‡≤†‚å£‡≤†
---
It sucks far more than people realize.
---
That must be why there is no visual difference between the leg and asc version of the pvp armors. There is also no inspect option to show off the armor quality.  It's only to show off the different color of the item in your bag to yourself! Why have I not thought of this earlier!
---
Your argument is rock solid, congratulation!
---
If you're a whale, you're not casual. You thinking this is wrong.
---
 Unless you have this research ready, you have no position to claim what you claim.
---
We aren't obliged to play the game either, you know.   
---
That's a weird "argument".
---
Fractals and Raids are PvE. They are not different game modes. Different builds are of course beneficial, I don't argue against that. But that is what ANet wrote: one for each "game mode".
---
It takes far longer than 30 secs to guarantee you haven't made an error.
---
That's the galling part, expansion price for no content for something we've been doing for years
---
Yet you still seem to be interested in what's going on with it.. otherwise you wouldn't care enough to post.
---
I am thinking about Archeage Unchained when it comes out. Besides that - there's nothing else really...
---
\^ the cultists- I mean the fans of this game pretty much, about everything that is wrong with gw2
---
"it's been terrible since day one you guise, it's a-ok if it keeps getting worse"
---
Oh yeah that one was very short lived!
---
It's not
---
.......you do know ANet endorsed it, right? Please use that peabrain a bit more.
---
Random thinking : league of legends
---
If you're still taking commissions, I'd love to hear from you when you're able to take one!
---
I'm gonna copy paste another answer of mine from another thread. If anyone tells me 6 slots are enough for 6 game modes, they don't understand shit.
---
----
---
Hm they are not tho. Imagine 6 build slots for necro.
---
Necro currently has the following builds:
---
Power Reaper - Raid variant
---
Power Reaper - PvP variant
---
Condi Scourge - WvW variant
---
Power Scourge - WvW variant
---
Condi Scourge - Raid variant
---
Condi Scourge - PvP variant
---
Condi/Heal Scourge - PvP variant
---
Heal Scourge - PvE variant
---
So 8 builds total .. all totally valid currently (maybe condi scourge in wvw not so much, but certainly will be viable after balance patch). You can't fit these many builds in the slots at release (6).
---
I've left out on purpose some less viable builds like core necro pvp variant, or open world builds .. if we include those the number of builds would be even higher for just one profession.
---
I'm sure Guardian also has this many variants .. and Mesmer Ele Engineer probably too .. Imagine 7 variants per profession, with 9 professions total, thats 63 total builds. So unless you max all slots on 9 professions, you won't be able to store this many builds in the shared build storage, so the system ultimately is ineffective.
---
I would argue that build templates are made for high end content players, like raiders and wvw ppl, who have a crap ton of builds. Using you hyperbolic numbers, most of the 99% of people don‚Äôt really use build templates or need them. The in game templates are geared towards the 1%, and they aren‚Äôt satisfactory for their target audience.
---
Sure, some casual players may delve into getting multiple builds because they finally have access to build templates. But build templates are necessary for the endgame players, not the majority of the people running one build for open world. Most casual players won‚Äôt be using templates.
---
They are basically useless to raiders/wvw‚Äôers, and pretty much unneeded for casuals.
---
There aren‚Äôt many people satisfied by the feature.
---
Oh hey, another personal attack by Etheri!
---
They could also have them stored client-side, that's how it was done for gw1 and you didn't have any number restriction.
---
You could also make folders and all to sort everything, but we are in the future now so better have things that are.... better ?
---
Wouldn't work because they still have to keep track of weapons and trinkets.
---
The game already ridiculously incentivizes the creation of alts of the same profession by the nature of how account bound everything is. A character can be leveled with an elite spec in an afternoon. If he already has 8 sets of gear in his bank (8*18 = 144 lmao?), then it would be a terrific boon to be able to split it up amongst several characters, one for WvW, one for Raids, one for Open World. Why pay "800 gems" for 2 equipment slots when you can pay 600 gems for 3 equipment slots in the form of a new character?
---
thats how you think as a player, but not arenanet when it comes to money.
---
lul.
---
Maybe you should buy a wheelchair, after all you are the one crying about 'omggg, I have to manually change the stat of 2 armor pieces so I can have optimal crit chance, how dare you anet???".
---
&gt; Every side project they were working on has been cancelled.
---
I have not seen that statement anyplace official. Large side projects: yes. Every side project: who knows? And that was in February. That is a lot of time to start a new project or two.
---
&gt; You had to buy rune pages in LoL too.
---
Yea and that system fucking sucked
---
well they really like to pull the whole dangerous/legacy code bullshit every time they can
---
can't touch dungeons cuz scary code, can't touch inventory cuz scary code etc.
---
why invest effort and money to rewrite when you can just throw your hands up in the air and say "it can't be done"? they're well aware they only antagonize a small portion of the playerbase and they're fine with it
---
If this looks alive to you then fair enough.  [https://i.redd.it/eyr4apfmkfk31.png](https://i.redd.it/eyr4apfmkfk31.png)
---
Eh I have played the game since launch and have complained alot about Anet in the past but I still don't really get the concern about this issue, people have been begged for build templates and to me it doesn't seem that egregious even when we do not know the prices. I mean bag, bank, mat expansions are monetized similarly. It's not the ultimate convenience with the limitations it has but it is better than no-templates and complaining that it doesn't accommodate all 1400 configurations people seem to want comes off foolish, "waah I don't have enough slots for my jumping puzzle or RP template". Hell most people have alot of builds for one class already have two characters of the same class. 
---
Idk maybe I am missing something here but it just sounds like a lot of whinging about monetization practices that have been the norm in the game since the beginning, Convenience=gems. Quitting the game over a nonessential feature that is silly
---
What? They still not fixed them? Good lord.
---
Can win an argument with logic, use insults. Great tactic!
---
Oh yeah predatory probably the dumbest thing I've seen this week.
---
The "level of QoL" OP wants is not possible.
---
ANet would never have released an equipment template system like arc's. It's too risky, it requires the player to keep items in their inventory, they'd need all sorts of edge case checking to deal with situations where the player changed or banked items, it would never work well enough for an official release. Arcdps does not work all the time, but that's ok because it's an unofficial add-on. 
---
ANet's system needs to incorporate equipment storage. Equipment storage means that the system needs to have a price tag akin to bag slots. That's all that's going on here. The real problem is that OP has an expectation of what level of QoL they should be expecting, based on a system built on a hack that was never going to fly officially.
---
I'm trying to craft Minstrel's gear but don't know where to buy the inscription. The wiki says I can get them from the Heroic's Notary in WvW, but when I visit them I don't see it for sale. Both HoT vendor tabs say "There are currently no items available in this tab" What am I doing wrong? Can I get the inscriptions somewhere else?
---
So...let's review. I tell people to stop whining about build templates. You tell me my complaining is just as bad. But since you are complaining about my action you are just as bad as me. But I am the one with mental issues.
---
Right...makes perfect sense.
---
it would work though if you could only use weapons and trinkets from other already existing templates runes and infusions would be a problem but imo can they be overlooked because you already safe a lot of space by using legi armor.
---
Not yet, no. For all we know they may be team 4's project and come with episode 5. Or never at all.
---
Well, actually, you can have up to three build template slots on one character! So you can swap builds without creating an alt :)
---
Considering that they specifically described Build Templates as "you can have up to 24 that are shared across all characters" and call it "Account Build Storage" that'll be sold in packs of 3, but didn't add that little titbit in for *gear templates*, then actually I don't think the distinction you're making is relevant. Because it just seems like desperate grasping at straws to me to play devil's advocate for the least likely outcome.
---
The customize UI window says otherwise.   It started out allowing you to change your stats and runes / sigils around (1.0).  Then they added a search bar to allow you to quickly locate those stats or runes / sigils (1.5).  Then they added in a function to automatically change legendary gear to all the same stats and runes in 1 go (2.0).
---
Templates will have improvements over time.
---
I'm new and wish to understand the game better. That being said I have no idea what I'm looking at here. What is all of this and what does it do?
---
Yup, exactly what I've been proposing. Unlimited gear BLUEPRINTS that are not LOADOUTS - in addition to the monetized loadouts.
---
&gt; Because of UI/tech limitations.
---
What a fairy tale. Why it is 6 and not 1.3 then? or 11? or 42.
---
To be fair I have knowledge in HTML5, Java script coding and substantial game modification. Most of that BS, and when it comes to money is not an issue.
---
Good to see that you're doing something with your life. Your crusade is righteous, and you need to keep fighting the good fight. You're all that stands between my evil and the freedom of this sub.
---
I‚Äôm right there with you. I play the game by visiting the sub and seeing what ANET screws up; it is pretty entertaining.
---
well, Fresh Air Tempest is even more fun to play now
---
I wonder if the heal skills should scale with level. A level 20 wizard regaining a lvl 6 spell slot once per short rest is prob not too out of bounds given the magic equipment and whatnot around then. A level 10 or so on the other hand being able to have free spells is getting iffy. The early levels are defined by limited spellslots and heavy cantrip use so it doesn't work at all at low lvls imo
---
You have no idea what a bad cash shop looks like. Guild Wars 2 has one of the best in the business, especially considering they went free to play. Selling minor convenience items and storage extensions is small potatoes compared to the straight up game play advantages from many other cash shops.
---
heal skill alone would be autopick for everyone at 4 and variant humans would be way stronger with it's current balance. 
---
Heal skill should be a full action considering its benefits and also recharge on a long rest not short.
---
Dodge is meh, not horrible op at 1/ short rest but it should cost a reaction. Doesn't need the limit of half your proficiency etc. Also it shouldn't refund the spell to the attack if you're the only target. 
---
Downstate is pointless and not worded well for a dnd feat. Death saving throws don't have a "downside" or did you mean you can't fail it but if you roll a 10+ you can succeed?  Technically as soon as you hit 0 hp you are considered unconscious and can't take any actions and since the feat doesn't say you remain conscious at 0 you'd be able to do none of these things.  
---
Look up the Zealot barbarian trait at level 14 if you want to see a psuedo-downstate that's done well. It's like gw2 warriors downstate 3 for barbarians every rage except instead of on kill Rez it's on heal before your rage is done. You could do something similar but just put the limited actions etc and make it so 3 or 5 failed death saves kill you outright since it's not like your raging etc.
---
Yeah, sure, and what about those players that actually play all gamemodes?
---
I can feel the legs splitting apart
---
Smart people has backups.
---
&gt;DPS Chronomancer for raids, DPS Chronomancer for Open World
---
How much of an equipment difference is there between two power chrono builds?
---
400 gems for equipment tab, 400 gems for personal build template tab.. another 400 gems for account build storage tab.. 
---
Lets just pretend you have 20 characters.  You need all 6 equipment tabs on everyone of them.  That's 120 equipment tabs you would have to buy at 400 gems each, that is 48,000.  $600+ alone.
---
They want to charge money for an inferior version of a game feature thats is free at the moment and then axe the free version.
---
As a player I like the idea.
---
As a software developer the idea gives me solidarity headaches for the poor people who would have to implement it.
---
The UX department would probably also not have an easy time with this.
---
Free to play is cancer.
---
Imagine catering Build Templates to players who don't use different Builds, instead of the Players that have Legy Armor to be able to play any Build they enjoy/want to test out or those who don't have/want Legy Amor and instead have a lot of Asc. Sets
---
Many recipes need to be "discovered" by putting the components for it into the Discovery tab of the crafting menu.  Discovering a new recipe like that gives you bonus XP for crafting, so it's the best way to level it up.  Each time you reach a new threshold in crafting (each 25 points), new recipes will become available.  Some don't need to be discovered and will automatically be there, others will need to be discovered by trying new combinations.  For the crafting professions that make equipment (like the two you picked), you'll figure out the pattern eventually once you start discovering things, and it'll reset itself once you get to a new tier of materials (iron from copper, etc.).
---
2009? For game files? Sure. Of course. Everyone had that. /s
---
Calm your tits, Mr. Angry Pants.  Not sure that I was defending the system or just giving information that I learned from the stream and trying to give the guy a solution.  
---
And you can switch gear.  Why do you think you can't?
---
Way to go from one extreme to another.
---
And the best thing is, if you were a poor soul creating legendary armor and hoping for more QoL, it takes way longer switching gear than if you'd have multiple ascended pieces in inventory.
---
does not having to take mats out of your storage to put elsewhere once it's full cut into gameplay? and managing bank space when you run out? how about fetching things from other characters because you don't have shared inventory slots? if youre going to complain about cutting into gameplay at least do it with all these things
---
I see, I missed that part. Thanks for the clarification.
---
&gt;st... forget that gold to gems exists?
---
We know gold to gems exist, but just because someone was/is hardcorde doesnt mean they have a lot of gold to spare, and just fyi if 1 gearslot is going to be 400 gems which isnt that unlikely, id have to pay 14000 Gold to get slots for 4 of my characters. And it would still be worse than what I currently have since id only be able to have 6 slots on each char compared to the 15 different setups I have saved on my mesmer atm.
---
*Akshually*, I‚Äôm all for paywalling all in-game rewards behind BLCs because developers need incomes too!
---
I don't think NCSoft would let them. I think and this is just my opinion they will want to build up a separate team for a side project. We all know GW2 was suffering late 2018 early 2019 before the layoffs because people were being moved. NCSoft and Arenanet probably realise this was a mistake because GW2 is their main money maker so everyone on GW2 now stay there and anyone new hired can be moved to side projects. If they try to do the same thing as last time its will end in the same way. Keep the GW2 team as it is, hire completely new people for other projects and keep treating GW2 as your primary focus while working on these side projects.
---
are you people all actually crying about having to swap one trait or something manually.
---
yes, please!
---
I'd go through so much more fashion styles, if I had this. But I'm too lazy to go through all the skins and then all the colors again and again and again. I don't even mind if it cost 8 transmogs every time, because I got A LOT of them banked already.
---
Even if everything were unlimited, this is one of the reasons why I think allowing add-ons or mods for actively-developed games is a bad idea. You can't compete with free.
---
&gt; but they aren't taking anything away from you.
---
They literally are. The currently free arcdps build templates will not be ToS compliant/work after this new not free build template comes out.
---
And you fell for the trap and don‚Äôt even realise it.
---
All of these minus naval battles are highly likely. The 4th content team could be working on a massive fractal and raid release highly unlikely but we never know.
---
I understand why anet is doing this and I understand why people are annoyed .  I think it all comes down to gw2s business model needing a huge update. I know they need to make money, but I‚Äôd rather pay a fee for content once and have everything earnable in game, than the system where a lot of content is free but some of the cool rewards can‚Äôt be earned in game.
---
What's not normal is that people spends money for mounts / costume / chairs / minis.
---
This is a RPG: I spend money only on equipment that makes may char stronger: ascended armor  with the best infusions, runes / sigils according to game mode,  solo/party.
---
1 berserker war, 1 viper war, 1 marauder wvw war, 1 berserker guard, 1 viper guard, 1 harrier guard, 1 diviner rev, 1 harrier rev, 1 viper rev, 1 magi rev...
---
NO I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
---
I think they said its a general template with a set build (traits and gear), but we will see when they release it at the end of the month, for now its all prone to change.
---
A telegraph similar to the DH chain is enough if it dismounts the attacker (the dismount will be the telegraph :)
---
Yes I did unfortunately.
---
Who‚Äôs this rando asshat and why should we care about his opinion?
---
^/s
---
That's interesting, I had no idea you could get there as F2P. That definitely simplifies things.
---
Will be interesting to see what they do!
---
... now you just made everything you said look retarded, good job.
---
‚ÄùFell for the trap‚Äù .. yes ofc it was your plan all along, if you dont have anything else to say just dont answer.
---
I don't think you're evil. You're harmful but not out of malice, just out of sheer stupidity.
---
While reflecting on my life, keep in mind you're posting significantly more here than I do. If only your gameplay was as hardcore as your whiteknighting we might even get along.
---
"often is more than 6 different builds people use."
---
Fucking really?
---
yeah, the game is pretty much dead because of this
---
The storage can be limited and sold, but the gear swap should be free tbh
---
Maybe, but I have 800+ tomes of knowledge in my bank, spending 20 of them a week + 15mins of playtime doesn't feel like gambling to me.  More like re-purposing obsolete resources.
---
Just to add, I have 8300 spirit shards already, and I only make Legs for my own use.  So yeah =P
---
Yup. This is my thought too. There were some (not so) subtle hints in the livestream about how precarious of a house of cards this system had to be built upon...
---
People who regularly raid and/or do fractals are swimming in ascended gear. It‚Äôs fairly easy to get more ascended gear than you know what to do with if you raid each week and do the daily fractals. So no, it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúrich person rant‚Äù and yes it does matter to more people than you think.
---
Woah, you need to BUY these? I haven't really been paying much attention to the game, I've just been logging in and playing around casually but not giving much attention to the news.
---
Suddenly I'm filled with regret having ever come back to this game.
---
&gt; I also estimate that I've deleted a couple of thousand Teleport to Friends by this point
---
Sounds like you need more friends ^_^
---
My knight geared reaper loves it!
---
So before arcdps was a thing,  end game players in pve, pvp, and wvw basically just made and leveled a second character of the same class. (Admittedly buying a character slot)  I'm one of them. I have 4 guardians, 2 eles, 3 rangers, 2 necros, etc.  When arc gained build templates,  I could easily rely on one or two characters per class. With the potential limitations of the new system,  I will still be using multiple guardians and rangers. I'll probably be fine on ele. But here's the thing: I don't raid anymore,  and if I raided hardcore, I'd be looking at adding 2-3 more build variants. Guardians, eles, and mesmers will have frequently have 3-5 loadouts on arcdps. Sure it's just a couple trait changes here and a couple gear piece changes there,  but with arc that's 2 clicks. With the new system you may have to buy more slots or get capped. Don't get me started on if these slots are character bound instead of account bound.
---
Hello,
---
\- Infinite salvage kits and gathering tools save you both time and money, as you'll never have to go to a vendor and waste gold or karma (which can be translated to gold) on them. Copper-fed would be my first option simply because it's adequate for greens and blues (and by extensions whites) and that is what you'll be salvaging most of the time;
---
\- VIP passes, if you care about saving gold more than time, are pointless. Considering you can go to the WvW lobby and access vendors, a banker, and trading post, everything exclusive to the pass of mostly occasional use (mystic forge, crafting stations, etc.); meaning: not a lot of saved gold;
---
\- Yes, you will have two shared inventory slots, occupied by two level 80 boosts. These can NOT be removed and kept elsewhere - the only way to free up the slots is to use the boosts. You can either make a new character and use them, or just use them in an already level 80 character (you'll get everything else that a boost gives you, such as equipment and boosts, etc.). I don't really recommend those boosts if you don't already know a class very well. The way to being a proficient level 80 players is to have learned the class slowly through regular leveling, specially for new players;
---
\- I agree, gem prices are high, and I totally subscribe to the hesitation in giving up the amounts required for tools. Gladly, you can convert gold to gems. Lookup a few good regular gold sources, do some of those (probably metas) daily and in time, you'll be able to cut a chunk off that price by converting some gold;
---
\- I always advise against bag slots, as they only work on one character and do not benefit the whole account. A new character slot gives you technically more space per gem, with the added advantage that you can always use the level-80 boosters on those if you want.
---
For those curious, the statement mentioned can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cz1rrb/build_templates_only_available_with_legendary/eywxzz9?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).
---
They're kinda already doing this with the big delayed box they sell.
---
They will probably increase the cap on both types of templates.
---
And I can only think of a few classes that could trully use the 6 gear slots (guardian, mesmer, ranger). If you need a gear slot for min maxing situations, sorry, but I have no empathy there, change that manually and roll back to the standard saved version of the build.once your are done with the encounter soecific build.
---
Then offer "non-storage swap". Like ArcDPS. As in "here's a method of clicking through pasted/stored chatcodes that switches stats on stat selectable items _in your inventory_". If the choice is "we want 400 gems per slot because we decided to 'store' gear in them" and "easy swap for already stored legendary item in inventory in 10 seconds" I'll always pick the second.
---
its not all rewards in the cash shop and you can gold 2 gems and even if you don't like it you have to be realistic about the world we live in.
---
im not saying gw2 is balanced. Both are unbalanced shitgames. If gw2 had league balance 3 classes each patch would be allowed to kill you with their mobility spell alone while you stnad inside your team while everyone else would be just canon fodder
---
Grats!  My keys have been pilling up since the last chest I was interested in was the one with the Humminbird, but I opted to open at least of these new series, and on my first key also got the mount.
---
I got so excited, I accidentally clicked on "open another", for which i was rewarded with a Tele + Wardrobe unlock
---
I'm not sure the OP was saying like just paying them. There's other kinds of support that I see other MMO's doing for their Content Creators that I don't see GW2 doing much or even at all. ESO for example has it so you can link your account with Twitch and get [reward drops](https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/56199) by watching people streaming ESO during certain event periods. That brings in viewers. While not all (or even possibly most) are going to stick and stay watching after the drops period ends, it still helps pull in some people who enjoy that streamers content and come back, but wouldn't have given them a chance during normal circumstances.
---
Beyond that though, just look at ANet's streams in comparison. ESO will bring on a lot of different content creators to play the game with the staff and ask questions (they won't always answer everything though) or just hang out on normal streams, while also having normal Q&amp;A dev streams and stuff to themselves too at other times. ANet on the other hand, seems to only bring on some creators (most from the art side of things) during major releases for small interviews purely focused on what the creator has made or feels about what hasn't been shown yet, while almost exclusively staying to themselves during all their other streams.
---
&gt; , I have legendary weapons: ascended is more convenient.
---
&gt; I'm not interested in those who play dumb, I'm not paying a ransom / extorsion for my templatas becouse ANET has not been able to deliver a honest / good one in 7 years.
---
ascended is more convenient if u do not need to bring 10 with you every time... and it is nor an extorsion nor a ransom. just keep on doing it manully like u are doing now. 
---
btw they are still alive after 7 years which is hard in mmo market so i suppose they had more than a good one
---
Holy shit you are such a toxic causal.
---
I know gw1 wasn't a huge success financially, but remember when all of these features were fucking free? They could've just kept releasing skins for stuff and made plenty of money.
---
Doesn't arcdps delete your gear
---
Nice! problem solved then.
---
So how come there are so many complaints? Have you even stopped for a second to read them before insulting people?
---
Wtf does this have to do with anything? I'm on the trump-is-a-traitor train, too, but it has no relevance in a gw2 subreddit. Get this bullshit outa here.
---
Good for you. If you look around any city, you'll see that you're not in the majority. People love paying for cosmetic stuff in MMOs.
---
Genuinly curious, but what other Add-Ons are there really?
---
Some that enhance Performance or Graphics, neither would be a problem here.
---
Overlay Programs like TaCo/Augmented Tyria, which in no way will be officially implemented by ANet since they are direct ways of shortening content to "follow this line" "go here" etc.
---
Radial Mount Menu - only one that I could imagine ANet to implement and that might be in danger of getting sacked if they do go the way you are proposing
---
Is there anything else I'm not aware of?
---
-------------------------------------------------------
---
For the actual Post: If we just stop complaining we loose even the last chance of hope that they make changes (even after implementation) because they think they made a system everyone is happy with, how exactly does that help?
---
And yea, I know a lot of people are just throwing their opinion in and for the most part not in a constructive manner; many are memeing the whole thing and others just want the drama, but the base for the complains is very much there and shouldn't be ignored
---
That's what he said.
---
Was there ever a confirmed instance of it *actually* doing that? I've always seen it explained as just a disclaimer and not that it ever verifiably deleted anything
---
can i ask, did you complain about locking mounts behind a paywall? how about raids? masteries? specialisations? all these were locked behind a paywall, and you cant even use them for free at all
---
What really could make this work.  is if the traits and utilities template section.. would allow you to save gear stats, rune type, and sigil choices.  If someone else tries to load up the build and they have legendary armor, runes and sigils as well.  It would populate their gear with those stats rune set and sigils chosen.  No need to put legendary equipment in a template and limit them.
---
This would be 100x better.
---
The things we would absolutely need though are the remaining legendary items, amulet, other ring, and yes that also does mean legendary infusions (nothing overpowered like +30 AR each) which would allow you to save the infusion stats into the shareable build section
---
According to efficiency I'm too 3% lol, 700lis and whatnot. But keep your opinion. I honestly don't care.
---
And I don't use arc templates cause I have proper organization. Arcdps I cool tho, always wished they would make it a internal thing.
---

\^ This
---
But I think it's way too late for this. I've said and had hopes for this for 7 years now. It's too late, the hole has been dug and there's no escaping it, especially with the situation Anet is in.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt have to create alts to have more builds
---
What has ffxiv to do with all of this?
---
I don't have a problem with people disagreeing, I try my best to encourage it. Learning about opposite opinions gets you closer to truth, and exploring the opinions of other people, especially of those who thoroughly disagree with you, can open you up to new ideas, even if you never fully agree with the other person.
---
Let's go back to the start real quick
---
&gt;No what they should have done is made build templates years ago. And what they should do now is not beeing greedy little goblins and trying to squeeze every last cent out of their long time users before they jump ship.
---
If I say, "Yeah, it really sucks that they didn't do that before, but let's move forward. Keep in mind that most people will only want 1-2 slots for this feature, and it's a relatively small set of players that are looking for 6+ slots, so I think it's reasonable to give the free QoL feature to the majority of players and ask the heaviest users to help contribute to the cost of development," do you really think that would be that much better? I've definitely made arguments like that around these discussions, and yes they get better responses, but you're probably right that my post and theirs are probably equally useless. They are angry about this change, which is understandable because it feels hostile to them. I am intolerant of people making arguments I see as irrational. In this case, I actually care more about that they are demanding retroactive fixes or free features more than the goblins phrasing.
---
I've sort of lost my train of thought here, so I'll drop off and see where you go with it.
---
Yeah this whole thing is an actual disaster.  I can't believe they're choosing to roll out such a requested feature (THAT EXISTED IN THE PREVIOUS GAME, BY THE WAY) in such an ass-backwards way that literally fucks the customer.  Way to let the marketing team roll out something your loyal fans and customers have been waiting for for years, dickweeds.
---
Whaling doesn't occur only because you play the game tons, in GW2 especially, with gems -&gt; gold, a hardcore playtime is not the only way to gain access to ingame valuables as well as pure QoL/convenience via gem purchases. The more time you spend outside the game, the more value you put in the little timesavers for the limited time you have playing the game.
---
nah, you can literally play full condi chrono with only switching chronophantasma to StM, that is a rather low dps loss and condi chrono does insane amounts of damage on SH and largos, condi quickbrand doesn't come close
---
And I'm pretty sure he hasn't. What a conundrum
---
ANet, my pride has broken.  You have won.  I don't believe I can continue earning all Story Achievements, when you drop these level of requirements into the category  :(
---
Honestly though, things like *Merchandise Collector* either need to be under the Rare Collections category or the drops need to have some other way of earning them over time.  Most story achieves are basically earnable through persistence.  This one appears to be heavily based on RNG or untold thousands of gold.
---
There is not a single case with proove where Arc deleted the Gear of even a Single Person
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/92s8m1/psa_arcdps_build_template_seems_to_have_eaten_2/) is the closest you'll get to someone claiming they lost their Gear and in the Same thread Delta (Dev behind Arc) stated:
---
&gt; This. As long as the "equip item X into slot Y" function is detected properly (and it is, else it wouldn't work for anyone), anything that happens as a result of using my tool could happen as a result of drag-drop or doubleclick equipping from the client. The warning I wrote half jokingly for the worst-case scenario where the "delete" function starts being identified as the equip function following a game update (which would also affect everyone, and I'd have remotely disabled it if this were the case). I'm honestly surprised so many people have taken that warning this seriously
---
Yes, thanks to Arcdps that lets you have unlimited amount of templates for people that actually need them.
---
Im sure casuals with one mixed armor set will be fine and dandy though.
---
To me it looks like whoever was responsible for making the ad was uninformed and thought the chair was bigger.
---
Seen a similar situation in Warframe
---
You will never have to use other runes than scholar in fractals. If your group really has problems reaching 25 might go for golden dumplings while playing base warrior or swap signet of might for "for great justice" while playing berserker.
---
Having a different opinion doesn‚Äôt make you an anet white night. You don‚Äôt have to purchase the new equipment slots and this post makes it sound like we are forced to purchase a new template slot for every single build variation we want. You can still manually change your build LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN.
---
I think all this controversy is stupid and I‚Äôve talked to other people who think the same but it‚Äôs difficult to actually discuss things on reddit because if your opinion goes against the reddit hive mind opinion then you get downvoted
---
Are you playing ranked or unranked?
---
I'm not one of the people angry about this whole thing, but I would definitely be something that bothers me. In my opinion, the gear slot is worth 300-400 and each copypaste slot is worth, at most, 100.
---
And I have zero problems with that, I love to play with fancy flashin' party people with my dim dungeon skins.
---
I have a problem when ANET kill _the game I_ play after years of gear perfectioning.
---
Yes, I 100% agree that legendary should have been done differently. It's sad really, I have hopes tho, glass half full.
---
Let's hope they find a way to make it fair for people with full legendary when they finalize the set at least, and given this new feature, add repeatable accessories since you are gated into 1 per account (except for pvp and wvw backs if I'm not wrong).
---
Nono! The art itself is colored instead of monotoned!
---
YOURE NOT WRONG??!!!
---
I have't touched my necro in a while but if it helps me keep being lazy with my minionmancering I'm for it.
---
I am a veteran and I dont use arcdps or even have multiple builds. I am not impacted at all /shrug
---
&gt;Just because they could do it with ArcDPS does not mean they can do it with the game itself without it being too expensive to make.
---
This old chestnut...
---
&gt;And, how many of these builds you are using regularly, you know, when you actually play the game outside the 2h/week raid run? 3-4?
---
I use all of them very regularly! Personally I am the designated chrono in a raid training guild. So I can be called up to use any of them literally any day I'm online, with no real warning in advance. Though I believe that this shouldn't even be a consideration - but boy did that blow up in your face.
---
It seems pretty clear that equipment, build, and account build are each three separate purchases, especially considering the mismatch in how many free equipment vs how many free build slots we get.
---
Hopefully they will have a slightly discounted build+equipment bundle permanently available, though.
---
Real talk though: a set of legendary armor is about 2000g and at least 10 straight weeks of raiding. 2000g is equal to ~5400 gems. Anyone capable of farming up a legendary armor set is not going to have a problem unlocking more than two gear templates.
---
Guess I am too casual
---
This is next level OCD
---
Also the templates hardly have any real worth for the casual players. They were mostly used by raiders who wanted to be more efficient anyway. So this kinda a moot point.
---
Do you mean account bound stuff specifically? Or any cool armor that you get from PvE?
---
Cause all the Dhuum drops look amazing, and Dhuum is a relatively challenging boss to beat.
---
For account-bound stuff, i love the armor set you get from Dragonfall. You need to finish quite a few achievements to unlock all the pieces.
---
There is too much negativity on this reddit nowadays
---
Depending on class, fractals or raids could easily have 3 builds alone.   
---
PvE could easily see 3 more depending on content.
---
I tested it out last night on my scourge in wvw. I replaced soul reaping with it. My results were less dps without feeling any tougher at all. Would not recommened unless someone can come up with a better build.
---
I kinda like the [Spirit weapons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spirit_weapons).
---
Might not be what you are looking for, but I'm a big fan of the [Zenith weapon skins](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zenith_weapon_skins) you get from achievement points. They actually have a lot of detail if you look closer, and there is a subtle glow effect when drawn. I especially like that the set includes underwater weapons so I can keep the same look everywhere.
---
As soon as I get. 1 or 100 means nothing for random Jesus.  And it is always shit
---
You can have it!

Just go cut them on a cutting plotter
---
This seems like an appropriate move actually because it stops more people from getting hit by the false advertising in the future. It's just a question of whether they're also willing to refund people who want it (which apparently they are).
---
I mean you could argue that they should fix the chair to look like the promotional image instead but even if they decided to do that, it would take time. Maybe they still will and they'll return the image, who knows.
---
ANet should probably develop and anounce compliance requiremets to allow 3rd party build templates at this point.
---
The extremely low hard and initial caps for templates suggest underlying issues that may not be very fixable without a massive rework.
---
More discussion with the community much earlier in the development of templates probably would have been a good idea.
---
Why did we need a totally new equipment storage for build templates anyways?
---
It could have just been a new inventory bag type (Armory bag/box/satchel:  bound equipment or upgrades in this container can be used with equipment templates), with inventory bag slots covering monetisation
---
Not having your templates on different computers must have felt bad if you didnt email the file to yourself or whatever though
---
 Very very good post! I agree with you 100%! Very well done!
---
I don't see why we shouldn't be critical of a product their selling us while a free, significantly better version exsist.
---
 Like, great they had the good will to let someone develop something good for the game until they can introduce an in-game solution, but then they turn around and release a worse version and remove their only competition so they can sell it to us. 
---
I'd buy an in-game version that did what Arc can do, This is not that. This is far worse. 
---
On the upside since it's based on chat codes atleast the build templates can be made unlimited via third party with a text editor without hooking into non-ToS compliant parts of the code so I expect that to be interesting to see developed. I wonder if they'll change the ToS to specifically outlaw them to sell us more build templates.
---
I dont want it for free. I just want the same convenience a 500 kb dll file done by one dude gives me. 
---
If you can't do that while being a relatively large company i won't pay you. Simple as that.
---
I used all mine (44 keys) when they added chaos skins on the chests.
---
You do realize the vast majority of players/veteran players don‚Äôt only buy gems with gold, right?  Most players don‚Äôt have the kind of wealth that you do that would even allow them to do that. you (and players like you) are definitely an exception and Anet is most certainly making tons of money off of nearly all of its players, including its veteran communities.  Also I‚Äôd say veterans are more likely to spend, too, since they‚Äôre more invested in the game overall compared to the randoms who just come in and play for a month
---
They said that the effect would be more related to profession / race, I don't see any difference for a mesmer / mirage.
---
Would be nice if you could earn them with eg. 500 Hatched Chilis for every skin. This would be an extra incentive to do tasks on the map and its a high enough amount that you do not get the skins so easily
---
It just feels bad to have skins locked behind rng (we already have infusions for that one), especially when you finally have charr only skins and will never be able to aquire them with a droprate this low...
---
Are you saying a system like what FFXIV has *wouldn't* be great though? Like, a system that allows complete freedom in what a character can do is objectively better than limiting what I character can do.
---
Yes 2 sets of it. How hard is it to grasp that the whole reason for templates is to switch as many as you want. I currently have 4 sets in wvw and 3 sets for pve on my guard. Now they remove the functionality of legy gear through arc and sell me this crap. I'm not going to be silent when getting ripped off.
---
I use mine whenever they have a mount in the chests that are 2000 gems on the store. If I don't get it, then oh well, better luck next time. I've gotten 1 or 2 skins on the 4th or 5th key so it's not so bad.
---
They thought they could fuck me and make me fork out gems for the ridiculous number of roles I play in raids... Jokes on them, I have over 20 alts with separate gear. Ready for all the inconvenience the game has been throwing at me. Ha.
---
... Still feel like shit about it, even if I play another game now. I jokingly said they were gonna monetise it in some awful way, didn't think they were gonna go through with it. Well.
---
And somebody get those damnable Quaggans off my lawn!

This achievement should be banished to the "Collections" achievement tab so we can forget about it.
---
I normally do map completion to get my black lion keys.
---
When Arenanet said LW Season 5 would have "Expansion-like features", I didn't expect to have to spend more money in Build Templates than what an Expansion would cost, without actually getting anything close to an Expansion.
---
For players who use many Professions and play all game modes this shit will cost them a lot if they want to actually have enough slots for it to work like it should.
---
They have changed the UI? Didn't logged in for couple of days.
---
Here you go, [this is the timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hoheLHE-8g&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=13777).
---
so in case of the build (traits + utilities) system you are okay with a system, which is basically a cash grab and does not even do what a template system would do...loading a build you have saved instead of saving every single change you make in your active tab while playing the game?  
---
that is rather strange to me.
---
Support, I definitely see both sides of the argument, but you nailed it.
---
Indeed. While I don't speak for everyone else, I would have been better off if the devs had never done any work on build templates.
---
FFXIV basically allows complete freedom in what a character can do, want to a be a caster DPS but your Viera is a tank? Slap on any caster weapon and now you're a caster DPS.
---
It's basically build templates but better.
---
If Arcdps never existed, there probably wouldn't even be an uproar about this right now. People were playing before arcdps and will continue to do so. Clicking a drag down menu to stats 10 times is an inconvenience, an annoyance, but not a nightmare. I get it, it sucks.  The real issue at hand is that people were using something for free, and now a lesser official version is coming out and you have to pay for the rest of it. If it was up to me, I'd give away unlimited build templates and charge for the ones that store the gear inside the template as a compromise. If that happened, another group of people would cry foul. The only way people would be happy is if they got everything and anet didn't make money off of it. Unfortunately that can't happen. People can say other things are coming out of the gem story every week, but when it comes down too it, its mostly stuff not enough people want. I have all legendaries, my fashion is set in stone. I have no need for gem store weapon skins, outfits, or even dyes now. I suspect there are a lot of long time players out there like me.
---
PvP is just toxicity and trolling and bot cancer. The serious players left a while ago. WvW is barely hanging on to playability. If you want to start GW2 I'd suggest looking at it from a PvE perspective, the golden days of PvP/WvW are long past.
---
this is the ui of gw2efficiency

I like to check the subreddit every now and then and I always perk up when I see one of my bosses :) nice job guys really impressive.
---
You do realize that what the 500kb dll file did wasn't even remotely close to what A-Net did, right? Arc basically is a glorified auto-clicker. That's it. The one A-net is making works with the game's data and code directly. Not to mention it has official support so if something does happen to go awry, you can actually get help.
---
There's a world of difference in the back end that all of you guys aren't even seeing. Refusing to see. Just because you do want it for free.
---
This is from [GW2 Efficiency](https://gw2efficiency.com/)
---
It's a website many use for tracking their GW2 account stats.
---
for everything? even blues and greens? If so then you have just wasted gold and had the inconvenience of an item that only has 25 uses.
---
Don't think it twice. If there's something worth spending gems on (with real money or converting gold) it's definitely the copper-fed kit. ANd of course place it in one of the shared inventory slots.
---
Point being that the Durmand Priory is a PvE map, and therefore *not* supposed to be in the mists.
---
Or convert each &lt;x&gt; bought character based bag slots into 1 account based bag slot unlock to match prices.
---
I did until yesterday. What little testing I did, did not feel good and I was constantly wasting abilities because I would forget I don't count anymore. It was hard enough to get people to stand in the one shade while running after the ones who didn't to hit everyone before and now it's just painful. Going to try going back to 3 shades and uping dps or might try out the new death magic with blood and scourge to melee tank somehow.

Remember when Anet stealth-edited out the advertised 2nd generation legendaries from the HoT sales page when they realised they couldn't deliver?

It will cost a lot if you actually get enough slots to make it usable. For a feature that should have been there from the beginning and free.
---
So yeah, players have the right to feel irked about it.
---
They do this and make it so rare so people will run strike missions then look at the metrics to pat themselves on the back for making popular content.
---
It's bad: more fragile, less dps, less support to party members, more time to positioning then someone kicks / pushes / pull the targets away.
---
If scourge was hi-dps or fast-dps it may have had sense to make it harder to accomplish that but...
---
&gt; It will cost a lot if you actually get enough slots to make it usable. 
---
Entirely subjective, and imo, blatantly false.
---
Quite often? Haha being playing the strike missions daily and so far aint  got nothing...but you unlock all 3 shouldrs from it or you have to pick one(heavy, medium, light).
---
The map of the mists show places in the mists? Scandalous!
---
I can't imagine having my chrono and my mirage be the same toon. Just buy a different character slot. If you had the gold t o gear 33 builds, you have the gold to buy a fucking extra slot.
---
Have to pick one
---
If they cost more than 400 gems per slot then picking up another character slot (800 gems) will be cheaper as it comes with 2 equipment slots.
---
Personally blew as many as I needed to to get the currency for Exhalted shoulders when they were in (coincided with grabbing a starborn outfit) 
---
Other than that rare weapon skins as others have mentioned. Ele sword, chaos skins, etc.
---
When in the history of ever has Anet responded to backlash *with change* in GW2? I'm honestly asking because I can't think of anything significant off the top of my head.
---
Maybe the time you suddenly couldn't exchange LI for LD? They brought that one back and clarified it was intentionally changed so you could not, but they understood players wanted it back.
---
But I don't recall anything regarding gem store and account upgrade stuff.
---
Multiple but its not 100% guaranteed you'll get transmutation charges more often.
---
Ok, maybe I didn't necessarily mean the developers working on the code. I do understand it is an old engine, however, a third-party program is giving us better templates than Anet can. If things are that bad then put it rest and move on. 
---
Realistically if someone comes to your house or business and you are a paying consumer would you really accept this?
---
Hol' up.
---
(shrug) It's all he said, douche said.
---
ez solution,dont play wvw or pvp,i didnt seen cheater in years XD
---
The sad thing is the glorified autoclicker is more effective.  Just because they worked hard on something doesn't mean it gives it value.  It has to actually provide the value they are asking compensation for
---
Its the completionist mentality, if this was under collections tab it would be fine, but as it is now its a huge thorn for anyone going for full story completition.
---
Honestly, I'd come back if they pulled what eso and swtor do. 
---
I'm not interested in paying a variable amount of money I  _know_ devs want as high as possible, but I will pay the cost of lunch out once a month for so called "premium" Quality features.
---
At least that one is still cheaper than this atm
---
Being completionist has its price. So pay up or change the mentality.
---
Yeah but executives need there new yacht and bootlickers need to make reddit posts.
---
Why spend my money on gw2 convieniance features when I can just go buy actualy content in the form of other new games
---
Did you pay for the content you got a few weeks back? The one before that? The one that will come next? Yet even after getting free templates, you want 100 more for free.
---
The short path to prevent this is not to ban anything else, its making it better than everyone else.
---
How can i take a product serious, which they want to sell me, when a basement hobby programmer does it better? I always feel like the look of something is always more important then the usefulness for anet.
---
I don't understand,  I already forgot about it with it in it's current spot.  If I can do it, then surely anyone can.
---
Im pretty sure when the patch hits, arc will break as usual and delta wont be allowed to fix it.
---
what? I have the exact opposite opinion. Build tabs are basically just QOL copy paste feature, so why would I ever spend any money on them what so ever? *Especially* if I can save the chat code in a notepad. If anything, *this* should be something you earn as a part of in game character progression or achievements or something. It's so low value, beyond the QOL, that I can't imagine ever buying them.
---
The Armory, however, frees up storage spaces in inventory. That seems like a big deal, since you don't need to hold the equipment in your inventory anymore. I would consider this an additive value similar to bag expansions.
---
From what I can tell, the limitations that are the root of all of these problems - having to separate build &amp; equipment, not being able to share equipment templates, having to charge inventory space prices for equipment slots, and legendary gear not being as useful as it ought to be, all appear to stem from technical issues with how the inventory is set up, and is likely why the feature was dropped in beta. The restriction to 6 equipment templates might be because of UI issues, but that one is harder to speculate on because devs have said less about it.
---
There is a possibility that the hardcore players would be better off without this feature at all, but they would have kept asking for it until the game sunsets.
---
Hopefully there will be a compromise where some form of arcdps templates will be allowed to continue, but I don't think I would count on that.
---
No one will come to your house and delete .dlls from your gw2 folder. A-net won't even be able to detect if you are using template file tbh. 
---
The problem is, arcdps developer won't publish updates to it anymore, like he stopped doing it with gearcheck (because remember what happened to that other guy who didn't comply?), so as soon as any patch that breaks them hits - you are on your own.
---
I don't want anything for free, i didn't ask LS to be free, and if they costed money i would have decided if i want to pay or not my dude. There is a very good reason they are free(and that's only during the first 3 months) and they are most definitely not doing out of their good will for us.
---
No better wait for anet to push out a price that is shit and complain then. They will certainly listen and adjust the price. Oh wait they never did that...and won't do so this time.
---
I rather tell them now to keep the price low than afterwards when it looks very bad for them to change prices.
---
Hmmm what's that last item in your shared inventory slots?
---
I'm with you, but gw1 build templates weren't involving any gear so it's a bit comparing apples to oranges.
---
And I‚Äôm sure you are being ***forced*** to pay $60 for all these things that ***should*** be free!!! Anet bad! 
---
On the other hand you can take your two ***FREE*** slots with a smile and think: ah nice at least now I can have my best/most common builds readily available at no cost compared to the past. 
---
Dude. NOBODY IS MAKING YOU GO OUT AND EARN $60 FOR ANET. You do that to yourself
---
Not every raid boss has a (significant) breakbar though
---
If you don't know your class well enough and/or have poor memory...then yes.
---
You are right but you will be downvoted to hell cause that's how this community is.
---
Just off the top of my head, these are all the builds I use for my Rev, which is my main. I run more builds, but I will separate these by general equipment differences.

I am constantly changing my build. I love to experiment and mess around with stuff, so I am often deviating from the above options. I don't mind changing traits up because it is quick and easy, but changing equipment is a pain in the ass. I dont feel like I *need* a template for each and every one of these, but I am admittedly a bit bummed that I will only have a default 2 slots. That said, I believe I read someone say that there is now a "change all" feature for legendary gear, so that itself is a huuuuge QoL improvement for me and lessens the double-edged-sword from the template announcement. I have been doing this without ArcDPS this entire time, so regardless I'm not absolutely heartbroken.
---
When I like something that I want or when I foresee a good return.
---
Yes
---
No, you don't have to buy them. You get 3 build templates for free and 2 equipment templates for free.
---
Probably they will increase the cap with time like for any other type of "storage" they put in game. I think a limited starting amount is also good to see how the servers will manage all the swapping and saved builds.  
---
After that...idk. I mean... If they put like 12 build templates it should be enough for everyone ffs XD
---
The game is getting too big for the status quo to continue, there are too many things in the gem store for the microtransactional business mode to work anymore. What do you guys think is it like almost 30% of the content by now? Lol. Literally every content release is met with rightfully (excluding trolls) angry people. After all, to just have access to a basic amount of cool looking things (not asking too much here, just one cool dragon skin or two, maybe a couple other things from the gem store), you could pay hundreds of dollars a year on a single game. Anet should drastically change how their company makes money and get rid of microtransactions to a large extent. It‚Äôs just not working anymore. They can‚Äôt even release a basic functionally that so many games provide for free without charging a completely unrealistic price for it. And because Arcdps will most likely be in a weird position from this, it‚Äôs not a cool option the community gets but rather a net negative in many ways. Company has to get paid, they need to get paid in a different way. This stuff is making the game go down a weird path. Not trying to be dramatic, just looking through the eyes of knowing how this company got to where they are in a realistic way.
---
Koda's Blessing
---
I mean, unless he can prove it, the statement stays the same.
---
People saying things happen all the time and with what Delta explained himself, it seems highly unlikely that if something were to go wrong, it would only affect one or two people.
---
Yeah, usually in around 20 keys.
---
You can't manually swap items anymore when you have so many. How can you find _that thing_ when you have 4 versions, same skin, in a ~150 inventory?
---
how about charging for content instead of in game settings? that just feels better
---
Ok, that's not so bad then. The way I read it, it sounded like the templates were account-wide not per character.
---
I thought there was a reason we pay 20 ‚Ç¨ for a mountskin that doesn't 99% consist of greed.
---
If there is a free plug in that does the job better than the implementation from devs, which also costs you quite a penny, than it's about to get ugly. Especially if there won't be a possibility to use the superior product anymore.
---
I'm sorry if this is the way this translates to you. I can't deny that i'm certainly on the side that wishes those templates to be more than what they appear to be right now, however, my goal with this post was more on the side of "understand why the people complaining are taking this so seriously and don't just aggressively shut them down/brush them off because you disagree/don't see their point"
---
This skill only functions this way if it doesn't stunbreak you though.
---
More stuff from the top of my head:
---
* the whole HoT rework/rebalance thing
---
* Jessica Price and Peter Fries
---
* adding an option for moving "Compact inventory" somewhere else
---
I actually have no problem paying a subscription if it means I get guaranteed content and no paywall bullshit like limitted bag slots.
---
&gt; Phantasms do not have additional effects on self
---
Neither does signet of air if you use it in the situation where it triggers the interrupt cooldown.
---
Implying the Gemstore has been closed for two years?
---
If they wanted a big kick in revenue, akin to an expansion, they could have charged $20 or whatever for The Icebrood Saga, which as I mentioned, most would happily pay for given the last expansion was two years ago. 
---
They are not "giving two months of subscription fees for the last two years", they are releasing a gimped feature players are expected to pay to fix.
---
&gt; What made it normal to expect that you get other peoples work FOR FREE?
---
False sense of entitlement and disinhibition, resulting from the use of the internet.
---
Jackasses are everywhere and any game pvp usually has those. I very much doubt wow community is any better. Last time I checked, it was toxic even in early game pve.
---
Would you mind telling me what they do? Because, as I said, I genuinly don't know aside from the ones I mentioned
---
Thanks for telling us how to play the game.
---
This is not build templates. Ok for the traitlines and skills it could be fine since we have a way to work arround that with copy paste outside the game. BUT this not actually saving stuff at the moment we want save. For instance, I'm on a build with my build template and just for this specific moment i want to change 2-3 traits that fits more, i cant go back to the build i "saved" without changing everything back manually afterwards. And this is the BIG issue on espcially gear templates. Let's say I'm on condi firebrand, so i have some grieving, some sinster, some viper stats and i want to go for quickness condi and put all on viper then. I cant go back to what it were when i was on condi because its not saved, your current equipment is replacing your gear template. I can't experiment changing a few things on my build cause if i do so it will overwrite my gear template, the "template" is not saved.   
---
It's not a build template if you have to change it back everytime you do a few tweaks.
---
Out of curiosity, what are you critical of in the game? I have never seen you give any criticism toward ANET or GW2, but I imagine its impossible not to think they could improve on something.
---
So in your opinion, what do they need to improve on? What are criticisms you would give?
---
&gt;Sure, there are new partners
---
Agreed but remember that we have now some yoga pants to buy :V
---
Your entire argument falls apart by comparing it to WoW. We also receive objectively less updates and content by comparison. We also did not choose the business model Anet uses for the game.
---
It also misses the point because, while yes there is concern over the yet unstated pricing of build templates, the limited functionality is the overwhelming concern
---
My reddit name ;)
---
Should be 3 minimum. I don't know why they didn't, they gave us 3 build templates default (pve, pvp, wvw supposedly) but only 2 for gear? I don't know about you but I'm not running around in wvw in the same gear I use for pve, let alone having power vs condi sets for fractals or raids or whatever else I want to do.
---
I was looking forward to having a power set, condi set, and fuckaboutwithbuilds set, and I can't even do that without paying for gems. And that's not even considering the ranger and mesmer characters with 3+ meta builds already. For them it's even worse.
---
Hey, they can't detect if a player teleports from point A to point C either...
---
In the stream yesterday they said WvW builds can only be swapped in the keep or base of your side. You cannot just get out of combat for a second and swap your build.
---
Having two different types of templates is the kind of idea that sounds simple, but will cause all kinds of complications down the line, both in the implementation and in UX.
---
Most end users/players do not pay enough attention to grasp anything but the most obvious stuff intuitively. It needs to be as simple as absolutely possible, otherwise it will cause confusion, additional support tickets and lost customers.
---
It's meant to help people who have no use for the "inventory slots" freed up by differet gear templates
---
&gt; Most players don‚Äôt have the kind of wealth that you do that would even allow them to do that. you (and players like you) are definitely an exception
---
Most veteran players also dont have the amount of login hours I have. With over 14k hours clocked and around 250k account value, I am in the 1% percentile for both categories of gw2efficiency users. 
---
If you check the percentile graphs for account value and playtime there, you will see that 50% of its userbase has played at least 1.4k hours and accumulated 15.5k gold account value. 
---
If you multiply that by ten, my account value isnt that extraordinary anymore.
---
Of course not, any game you play on a computer is, to some degree or other, storing information on that computer, if not on the drive than at least in the RAM. My point was more that, for a modern online game, storing what amounts to player account data (in the case of Equipment Templates) or even just information that the player might want to access from more than one location on that player's computer is risky on several levels and almost certainly unnecessary.
---
Arc changes gear slower than the anet templates so kinda questionable
---
Thanks. The salvage one in particular was big and I just completely forgot about it.
---
Fair criticism, different weapons would cause some trouble, as well as the fact we can't reliably get qol legendary trinkets for every character
---
Csgo copy pasta
---
There's plenty of maps that are faster than newbie zones like Queensdale.  Go map complete Bloodstone Fen, Dragonfall, Grothmaw Wardowns, the Silverwastes, all three Orr zones (four if you count Siren's Landing, its hearts aren't too long).  If you're purely aiming for keys, those maps are much faster than non-Orr core Tyria maps to complete.
---
I've been here since launch. This "the game is dead" narrative has been there since the beginning. The game is doing fine.
---
Isn't the point of an MMO interaction with other players? If they want to donate, why would he stop them?
---
I use them when there are any type of skins I want. Currently have 17 normal and 3 gold saved but the beastslayer and Abaddon skins do nothing for me. Got mount on first key so they are just wasting bank space until next chest update
---
Ignoring the fact that you think their work has no value just because you don‚Äôt find value in it:
---
How do you know the auto clicker is more effective? Have you somehow used the anet solution in game across several modes and characters already?
---
Or are you simply assuming it‚Äôs worse after reading a few posts and looking at some screenshots? 
---
Honestly. Having used arc templates since they have been available, I find them very clunky and problematic, they are ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù but that‚Äôs because they are all we get right now.
---
I have no problems paying a small amount for some gems to unlock a few more if I think I need them. Just like when I got some more bag slots, shared inventory slots, bank slots, crafting slots and character slots
---
If you don‚Äôt want to pay, don‚Äôt pay. But don‚Äôt delude yourself into thinking you are entitled to anything for free
---
You are delusional if you think this was easy to implement. If it was, they would have monetized it years ago.
---
Necro has been my main class for many years, and will likely still be even with the changes.  
---
What i can say: I understand why the change was made in WvW, and I'm ok with it there, as the way scourge plays in WvW group content, the changes make sense.   
---
It feels bad in PvE. Not bitching about the damage or whatever. It just feels like what was before a decently fluid mechanic, where you could be close to a group and deal with other groups via shades from a distance, or at least engage those groups, now feels very cluncky and overall less satisfying to play.   
---
I honestly think they made a change based on a competitive game mode that affected PvE, where this was not an issue but now makes the class \*feel\* weird. This is one of the few cases i think a distinction between WvW and PvE skill behaviour would be completely acceptable.
---
U forgot somethink , you need to pay  for arenanets shittier version, not for arc :)
---
Post is inaccurate, the ANet template would only come with 2 bullets, the other ones are extra gems
---
Well also the fact that we simply don't have enough legendary trinkets to cover all 6 slots at the moment.
---
That seems like a very reasonable option, but in the end, only anet programmers truly know what the code behind the game looks like, so this may be super easy or extremely dificult to implement
---
Tbh, it should looks like this:
---
You are starting with a pool of 9 build templates (3 per game mode on default), which you can freely use between any of the game mods (with a minimum number of 1 per game mode), so in theory, you could have 7 for PvE, 1 for Wvw and 1 for PvP, with a maximum pool numer of 18, for now.
---
Because even right now, you have 3 overall, and you can get only 6... and it should be 3 per GAME mode, not overall.
---
But does it count if they add the pieces one at a time? Or if they won‚Äôt ever complete a set, then at least add chest and legs for some sets and pass on another piece
---
It's nothing new, really just a big circlejerk. They really don't like being told that things are being blown out of proportion, time and time again. 
---
There's a reason why no one respects this subreddit.
---
I interestingly have the opposite problem at my game, death saves are too easy because you can just heal someone and get them up instantly and reset them with a healing word as a bonus action. 
---
Most classes have some form of sustain (fighters second wind, healing spells, druid temp hp in animal shape, bard short rest bonus) also everyone has Hit dice for daily healing. There are also items and consumables for healing that you could give access to for the party such as healing potions or the Staff of healing. 
---
 healing/ abilities that heal are a major party resource and these feats would completely reduce that mechanic to nothing which would make it difficult to drain your party of resources and get them to take a break from the dungeon or have them weigh the pros and cons about using their resources for a fight vs leaving or negotiating out of it to rest up and go back at it tomorrow better prepared. 
---
It's one of the problems with the life cleric/warlock multiclass that makes it very difficult to drain parties of their healing resources when they can just heal a silly amount in an hour with refreshing spell slots. 
---
For the wizard alone: you could cast Tensors transformation or one of the investitures every encounter... That's insanely powerful at high levels. By level 5 they have permanent haste or fly or some other crazy 3rd level buff. 
---
Also how would the trait interact with multiclassing? Could I refresh 6th level spellslots while I'm a high level cleric with one level of wizard and get a free mass cure wounds?
---
Full action, 1/long rest. Only way I see it not being insane. A free spell slot that costs you a turn to get and gives you a heal once per day would be ok and would be closer in power level (although still reaaaally strong) with feats in the game like Magic initiate (which btw can get you a free cure wounds or healing words once per day at first level and adds it to your spell list that you can cast with your own slots if your a caster, just saying if you want to recommend a feat to your players that have no healer)
---
Lets not forget equipment template slots are per character, imagine paying up 400-700 gems for each single build you want to use all your characters you play...
---
and even if we would pay for it, we are still caped at max 6 slots, thats not even half of what many use here for their characters.
---
Legendary gear also loses a lot of their value now  pointless when you get the same effect using asc gear and paying up for equipment slots, but i
---
guess thats what they are aiming for nowdays, making what you work hard for via ingame means being less worthwhile, while pushing you to pay up in gemstore more and more...
---
Yes but this is about FASHION WARS! Not cost effectiveness lol
---
So i've been absentmindedly completing the dragonfall maps for some easy mistborn motes, when I received the map completion chest when this area of the wing was still completely undiscovered. Turns out an extra POI was hidden here that doesn't account for the total...
---
That is the biggest problem right now, I hope eventually they make a proper way to go full legendary
---
Right now, my idea is that those "infinite templates" would only be different in the legendary stat choices, not in any equipped items
---
Elegy/Requiem Armour from LS4 Episode 4, which made people complain on its release that it looked better than Legendary armour.  Stellar Weapons from LS4 Episode 1.  Many raid-specific skins.
---
Most of the LS4 maps have some unique exotics dropping rarely from chests or events in them.  Things like the Sunspear and Sunscythe from Episode 1 and 6, and the Branded Eye of Argon from Episode 4.  You can find these skins on the Trading Post, but they only drop in very specific places.
---
Imma just keep doing it for free by having a bag dedicated to gear since my bags never fill all the way anyway, and just manually change out my stuff and rebuild, which takes about 5min. Less if you know what you‚Äôre doing.
---
It‚Äôs free but hey, you get what you pay for.
---
Oh that is pure garbage. So If I want go from Minstrel FB to Celestial since my squad is dead and I deep behind enemy lines roaming/hawoking, I just cant.
---
I cannot name all as some are privately developed and therefore aren't available for download anyway but here's a list:
---
* arcdps
---
* buildtemplates
---
* mechanics log
---
* scrolling combat text
---
* boontable
---
* bufffood overview (the one I am developing)
---
In case you know how to code, there's an API on the official website, with which you can code your own arcdps addons
---
oh my god for a second i thought those were lightsabers
---
They can:
---
1.  Leave the gaps and marks and have some skin showing. They‚Äôve done that before plenty of times 
---
2. Carefully design it so it can look the same on all weights without clipping at all. The new legionnaire shirt looks the same on all weights and it‚Äôs amazing to have something that does
---
3. They can just quit whining and design 3 slightly different versions. Yeah it takes more work, but not THAT much more work, come on
---
I already got one, we might as well compete for downvotes lols
---
They technically are! They're the Holosmith swords. :D
---
Fair
---
I wish we had legendary trinkets without the shiny effects and with a lower price than the current ones, they certainly wouldn't hurt the game if they were added
---
The point is that complex games are not developed for majority by any stretch.
---
The Point of Interest on the Wing there is for some reason a copy of the Verdant Falls PoI elsewhere on the map rather than the unique PoI it's meant to be.  As such, the map can be completed without going there.
---
The fact you said "class" singular kinds points to the fact you didn't use arc DPS templates anyways and arnt particularly relevant to the conversation....templates are not replacing knowledge they are QOL and speed improvements. 
---
Most of the loudest voices asking for robust templates are the top tier players who have extremely deep knowledge of the game.
---
That is always how it works.  You make an assertion.  You need to provide the evidence.  You haven't.
---
You've only made some hand-wavy appeals to majority and logic using imprecise language, which I've illustrated the faulty logic of.  You're arguing because you have nothing and you don't like that I continue to say you have nothing.
---
If you are at the MINORITY that pays for items in the gem store, then thank you for supporting the game that 70-80% of players (don't have the exact numbers ofc but you can see the mount skins and how often the new ones come by near you in-game) do not give event 20$ a year.
---
Also, can you point me to said addon?
---
1 build per mode per character is all I need. I don‚Äôt understand why anybody would want to roll all specs and builds on each and every of their 5+ characters. Seems just dumb to me.
---
When has this subreddit not bitched about every single change yet continue to play?
---
That‚Äôs a whole new low for Anet if they think adding a whole set to the gem store, one piece at a time, is different from adding a whole set. Low and stupid
---
&gt;Ignoring the fact that you think their work has no value just because you don‚Äôt find value in it:
---
Uhm, if I don't find value in it, it doesn't have value to me.  That how value works.  Just like feminine hygiene products don't have value to me because I am a man that would not have a use for them.
---
&gt; How do you know the auto clicker is more effective? Have you somehow used the anet solution in game across several modes and characters already?
---
Based on what Anet themselves stated how equipment templates work.  I can't auto equip, stat, and upgrade legendary gear just by moving it from character to character like Arc.  I have to remove equip the template on one character and move it to another to manual equip and upgrade.
---
I mean I guess you can doubt Anet themselves, the do say a lot of things they don't deliver on.
---
&gt;Honestly. Having used arc templates since they have been available, I find them very clunky and problematic, they are ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù but that‚Äôs because they are all we get right now.
---
I don't disagree but they had more function than what Anet has proposed on thier stream and posts.
---
&gt;I have no problems paying a small amount for some gems to unlock a few more if I think I need them. Just like when I got some more bag slots, shared inventory slots, bank slots, crafting slots and character slots
---
Good for you.  My however will not be.  Even having them still will send me back to the days before Arc templates and have me manually moving gear.  Yeah they added a cool new feature to apply all stats from a single piece of gear, but I don't have to pay for that.
---
&gt;If you don‚Äôt want to pay, don‚Äôt pay. But don‚Äôt delude yourself into thinking you are entitled to anything for free
---
Are you sure you are replying to the right person friend?  I never said that anything they are releasing should be free, only that it has no value to me.
---
&gt;edit forgot to add, the simple fact that I won‚Äôt have to update a 3rd party app after each update to use the templates (and not crash every 30mins) has value to me. That‚Äôs easily worth a one time cost of ~¬£15
---
Cool.  For me its about having a function that no longer exists because its a has more value to players that equipment share than the paid solution that they are rolling out.  If I could pay Anet for the same function I would, but I can't, because they didn't make it that way.
---
People who do more than open world, Yes.
---
Raids have multiple builds, fractal will be different again for agony infusions then you have open world/for fun and WvW which has zerging and roaming.
---
This is too funny .. "Please nerf a core ability of one class so that I can gank them" ... omg lmao!
---
But they advertised that the game would have hardcore friendly content. PvP and WvWvW for those types, and repeatable dungeons that would have variations each time you went through them. Sure, no raids, but the plan for hardcore content was already there.
---
yep, confirmed in the stream yesterday...everything you do i automatically saved on the tab you are on. even if you just change utilities in your bar outside of the tab.
---
At first that's what I expected this to be. I'm horrifically disappointed, though.
---
Well initially there was no wardrobe and you couldn't just bind skins to your account. If you want to transmute stuff you had to combine two items with elite transmute stones.
---
&gt;I'd say we've seen a heavy decline in these players. You can short term replace them with new players doing content once a month. Long term I believe this lowers the accessibility and value that gw2 has to offer and will limit its further growth. 
---
Only for Raids and WvW. PvP could go either way, but open world PvE won't bat an eye.
---
GW2 at it's core ultimately *is* "players doing content once a month". It's far more akin to a modern "live game" / GaaS than a traditional MMO. Both in terms of business model and gameplay.
---
Honestly I am surprised how much empathy and sympathy this community is supposed to have, or how they're "the friendliest" in any mmo. Bc anytime something is an issue that doesn't necessarily bother them too much people who are bothered by it are "whiny" or can go play a different game.
---
Actually, the PvP ones did include gear templates as well, though I think they might have been separate.
---
But I agree yes, I think what would be better to say is trait templates, as they would be closer to GW1 build templates
---
As a long time guild wars 1 player with well over 10,000 hours. I over 200 build templates. 40-50 of which I used regularly on my characters.  When GW2 came out I was flabbergasted that the old template system didn't make the cut. Now 7 years later one of my favorite features is coming back, but their implementation is really adding insult to injury.  I don't find the limit on equipment templates that bad, especially being it functions as storage for the gear too, but only allowing a finite amount of templates to be saved effectively makes the whole feature useless in my opinion.  I wouldn't even mind paying for it if there was an option that allowed an infinite amount of skill templates to be saved.
---
I'm seeing an influx of bots in general in all modes including pve, wvw, and pvp.  In gaming there will always be people trying to bot but not doing anything about it is what really reflects poorly on the game itself. Anet needs to get out their banhammer.
---
They're just making dumb jokes.
---
If you played for 1 year you owe them 180 dollars? Are you nuts? 
---
You realize other mmo's with sub fees make up for the sub fee by having FREQUENT content.
---
I was happy paying my WoW sub fee back when i played because i got REGULAR raids and dungeons... instead of waiting 9 months for a raid (which gets cleared in an hour), and 1 year for a new fractal.
---
Your logic is flawed.
---
If they magically changed to match the production quality, pacing, and content of other games which charge that much?
---
... Probably not because I'm more frugal with my entertainment expenses and don't like MMO style design of invalidating all of your gear with new stuff to replace it with. My point being if they want to be compared to a game like WoW they need to become competitive in update, pacing, and price. It would not make sense to charge $15/mo for what they have right now.
---
Only if it releases content as large and frequent as WoW does. Then yes, I'd happily pay.
---
Currently, at the rate Gw2 releases content, it'd only be worth like 2 dollars a month to me, since it has literal years of nothing new that interests me.
---
As Deltaconnected found, GW2's inventory system is a bit more complicated. When you need to factor in different configurations of legendary gear, you can't settle for a simple fast swap system. Also, they made it a hot key based system so you could swap gear instantly, I'm pretty sure that would get gummed up if it had to search your bags for the right item every time. 
---
Also I'm more than reasonably confident that items don't have unique IDs, they're identified by name, so if you had the same item with different stats but the same runes (easily done with transmog) the game wouldn't be able to search your inventory and correctly identify which belonged in the template. 
---
Edge cases don't come up often, but anet isn't going to release something that can possibly screw up in these (and gpodness knows what other) ways. One thing we know for sure js GW2's inventory code is old and spaghetti. I would not be surprised if it simply was not something they were comfortable doing like Wow.
---
if there was a sub fee, i can guranutee that the last 1 year of the game would have much more worthwile content to do
---
Why so much hate for outfits :o
---
and ive been pissed since day 1
---
Make an assertion -&gt; provide the evidence.  And yet you have no idea how many people because what you have isn't data.  You have no idea how many shards because what you have isn't data.  You can call it data, but it isn't really data.  That's called being dishonest.  What you have isn't a reasonable conclusion of anything.  It is simply a guess that you cannot prove.
---
content is optional if you choose to not pay for it
---
you dont have to buy the expacs
---
people are upset because they don't get "enough" templates for free. but they also forget that GW2 is a Buy2PlayGame with no subscription fee and free content updates.
---
The truth is GW2 has the best business model for a B2P/F2P game. just for comparison: in ESO you need a active subscription for the material storage, you can buy Houses for $100 in the shop and even more expensive mounts compared to GW2.
---
that's one cool charr
---
This is the dumbest reply I have read maybe all week. Of course you don't care about template limitation if you only play fucking minstrel chrono on every boss. Thankfully not everyone wants to leech their way trough life. Get real
---
punk.
---
because nickle and diming veteran players to death is good for the playerbase?
---
In Pof they implemented the ability to 'chain' instances that happen in the same map, and dynamically changing the limits of the instance, the chunk of the map the instance takes that is shown as red borders that kick you out of you leave them.
---
Towards the end of S4, they implemented mid-mission checkpoints that they used much more in PoF, allowing you to continue a mission from more points instead always at the start.  
---
I've seen no situation in which the worldmap changes without changing the map, so it likely goes with the map.  So when they change the world map, the map had to change too, like when going into Kormir's library.  
---
They probably chose to put the Special collections and the lair of glint in the same map so there would not be a long loading screen between the priory and the lair.
---
I'm not telling you how to play the game, im just confused as to why there such a negative outcry when I can't think of more than 4-5 builds that you'd need to switch between on a constant enough basis that you'd *require* a persistent equipment slot. Just seems like there's a disproportionate amount of anger towards something that isn't nearly as bad as people are making it out to be.

Fair enough. Then DO NOT BUY and, just like you did the last years, continue playing normally like me. I am also not buying any. You could also stick it to the man by not even using the ones they give you for free. That will make your point stronger. Try that!

arc did it better, and quicker

---
Built templates should have been in the game from day one. They were a key feature of GW1, and you could argue that there is even more flexibility in GW2. There were no condition builds in GW1 and support builds were for niche roles.
---
Releasing the build templates now is nice, but it's severely limiting players who either can't or don't want to fork over a lot of cash. You just don't have the same flexibility you used to if you're used to arcdps. What's the point in having a dozen viable builds if I can only play with a fraction of them? 
---
Regardless of if you think arcdps should have ever been allowed or not, it was released by a small developer years ago without ANet's support. That begs the question of how hard it would have been to implement if it was prioritised at any point.
---
Look up "naturalcrit homebrewery"
---
anet and communicating with us ... good joke
---
Didn't they just recently release a patch that lets you switch stats on all legendaries at once? Like literally yesterday.
---
They expanded the max number of shared inventory slots multiple times. They've done the same with bank tabs a bunch.
---
If people end up buying these to the max, anet will increase the max.
---
I just joined this club. Hi guys.
---
i have enough of an idea to state that the majority will not have that many shards. what i have is data, it just isn't terribly specific, but it is specific enough to reach a conclusion. whats dishonest is arguing out of spite and not for any real reason other than the logical conclusion doesn't conform to what you want it to be.
---
I mean if that's how you want to read my message then I won't stop you. Take care bud
---
1. Wrong. It is, and will remain, valid reference against which the official solution will be measured. And if the official solution isn't up to the standards of the 3rd party one, this WILL reflect badly upon the developers. So yeah, it is productive.
---
2. "Pay attention to details"? How is a whole new interface section a detail? How could you possibly not pay attention to this? This is just ridiculous, and you know it.
---
The issue must be handled, simple as that.
---
I can't play normally after the update because I've been relying on build templates for over a year now. Those templates are my normal. They're what enabled and encouraged me to try more builds and create more legendaries.
---
I don't want to "stick it to them" -- I want my concerns to be heard and to be able to retain playing "normally" with their official solution.
---
&gt;  they could have charged $20 or whatever for The Icebrood Saga, which as I mentioned, most would happily pay for given the last expansion was two years ago.
---
Yet they will release it for free and the thing they ask us to pay for (IF YOU WANT TO - Something that would not be possible with an expansion - AND ALSO get some for free) is templates. I think we get a very very good deal. Cause I will not be buying templates (I don't change builds at all) but if there was an expansion I would have to.

Houndskin mantle https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Houndskin_Mantle.
---
It would be pretty easy to make a $10/month sub that just gives you gems plus some skins that can be found in black lion chests otherwise.
---
This is the unfortunate truth. Regardless of how many builds a single raider has set up in arcDPS+Templates, theres at least twice as many players who use neither arcDPS nor more than 1 build on their character.
---
Or 1 million dps deadeyes. Easy cheese dhuum cm.
---
Yeah.. that's super sad, only for builds right? Or does the same thing happen to equipment too?
---
no because each map is a contained instance, like in core maps where you can see the outer area just as a void when you get high on mount
---
It's account data from https://gw2efficiency.com showing completion of a guild hall. The website can help you manage your account(s) collections, inventory, currencies etc.
---
what free build template tool?
---
&gt; **What made it normal to expect that you get other peoples work FOR FREE?** 
---
Simple thing. Modding cannot be remunerated because it uses assets that belong to a trademark. So as modding developped, awesome things given for free (for lack of a way to monetize them) became the norm. Unfortunately, workplace regulations and the sheer amount of modders make paid developpers keeping up with modders a difficult task.
---
ArenaNet wanting money for a (seemingly-)inferior product is fair. ArcDPS not having cost a dime to those who used it is where the injustice lies.
---
That's like saying a sabre is dull because the side that isn't sharp doesn't cut. If you pick and choose you don't get the actual result.  
---
The skill doesn't have an effect without a target, but it can have an effect. Phantasms don't break stealth, and they are just an example of a skill that requires a target and only has offensive effects.  
---
Signet of Air is a skill with only offensive effects. It's has an effect on enemies, an effect on self, and players are meant to be able to use  either or both.   
---
Now, why should it go on interrupt recharge instead full recharge when used with no effect?  
---
Not everyone plays with Discord or other voice commands, and they should not be expected to do so, or to type in chat before doing things.
---
An ally breaks stun to the party, you use signet of air right at the same time, the stun break is wasted.   
---
What's the ally supposed to do? Ping the skill in chat and let you prepare? And what about ally stun breaks from traits? How do you ping that? Opening the freaking hero panel and pining Gale Song or Indomitable Courage in the middle of a fight?   
---
That's completely unreasonable.   
---
But if an ally breaks stun and you use the skill at the same time and it simply goes on interrupt recharge, you don't get to spam the skill again, but also you don't lose the stun break just because an ally was skillful and responded fast to the stun.
---
Reacting to a tun break quick before the enemy stunlocks is to be considered skillful play. Skillful play should not be punished by having the skill wasted just because two players used them at the same time.  And so the change is an improvement.
---
So you're saying that making a collection that requires 30k gold (just to clarify, a price tag that is barely reached if you buy all gen 1 legendaries) to complete is perfectly fine and a part of the community that likes to hunt achievements should just bend over and take it?
---
No, they store it in a database:
---
Traits: 3x6=18 slot  
---
Weapons, trinkets,back,Armor: 19 slot  
---
Weapons,trinkets,back,armor stats:19 slot  
---
Weapons sigils 4, weapon stats 4 slot  
---
Weapon infusions 4x2 slot  
---
=18+19+19+4+4+4+4 = 72 slot for one template , for one toon.  
---
at least two columns, 1 for id, 1 for the content  
---
multiply it with account count 212.885 from [gw2efficiency.com](https://gw2efficiency.com)  
---
thats 15 327 720 line in a database for only one toon per account.
---
Give me back my idle animations!
---
The fuck?!
---
Making scourge worse in PvP sounds like a great outcome, it's a horseshit build in a game focused around standing on points.
---
If Anet stepped up their game to match FFXIV's quality, yes I would.
---
As far as we know, UI is spaghetti code and they're scared to touch and change anything.
---
And I think arcDPS templates "simulate" players' clicks, so the server "thinks" we clicked something and reacts to it. Not an expert here, that's how it was explained to me/I read it somewhere.
---
Exactly. It isn't as if GW2 is bug free, streamlined, and performs flawlessly for the majority of its players.
---
Never ascribe to malice that which can be explained by incompetence.
---
small developer vs a professional team isn't an argument... they did prioritize it... it was prioritized differently than the small developerr. Small developer's list of features to add to guild wars 2 was likely ridiculously smaller than the the dev team's... in fact if the dev team was 10 people and the indie dev was 1... I bet the list was disproportionally larger... meaning the small dev probably had 2 items on his list, the larger team's is probably closer to 2000. So realistically they have less people to work on it than the small guy.... Honestly... I would question them if they prioritized something like templates over other features... like say... bags. Would it have been nice to have on day 1? Yes. Surely it would have. I can guarantee that anet would agree with you as well. But I can guarantee they still have items on their list that they came up with when the game was still in conception that they have not implemented yet that would have been nice to have on day 1. Unfortunately, they do not have unlimited money so they have to prioritize it, and they felt like templates weren't particularly high on their list... 
---
and to further the point that they should have never made that deal in the first place... the fact that they got someone to do something for free... probably lowered the priority of this feature even further. Had they not made that deal, I could have seen them adding in Templates instead of something like the griffon mount as part of Path of Fire and then saved the griffon mount for the last living seasons and just cut the skyscale entirely. If you wanted this feature sooner... not having alternatives actually hastens it. If there are alternatives, why would it rank high for them?
---
Also while I may not care about the company as an entity or the NCSoft executives, the developers and artists who make the game are people who seem to really love their work and their chance to create a world, and so i connect with that. They do not know me, but their whole job is to make something that I will enjoy. And I apprecoate a lot of the creative brilliance that these individuals put in.
---
Well I hate doing UI code as well, but when something needs to be done you roll up your sleeves and do it. It's what you get paid for.
---
Sure, once they give me 180$ dollars of content.
---
The thing is, no one gives a shit about the lesser inventory slots. Like we invested already, our chars got 200-300 slots and we can store all the gear.
---
It‚Äôs about swapping fast. 
---
Gw1 had its templates on your client, you could have as many as you had space for on your pc
---
I mean arc kinda does the same
---
Sounds rough, but id still prefer it over the current situation.
---
The whole achievement UI is one big sadness.
---
Aww
---
I always wait for there to be a much desired item, usually a mount skin, since getting that saves you 2000 gems.
---
Since I didn't really want that Gallant Lightbearer raptor skin (too cute), the last chest I was really interested in was the one with the Hummingbird, back i April.
---
When this new one was announced, I didn't "think" I wanted the jackal skin, but opted to use 1 key on it anyways.  Luckily got it on the 1st key, and boy was I wrong, as I love this skin.
---
I still have about 30ish keys stockpiled, all earned from weekly key toons, map completes and PvP reward tracks, so the next juicy chest that gets released, I'll have plenty of chances.
---
Was it Charr Norris? Only Charr Norris could do something like that.
---
The strike mission ones pale in comparison to the helm one from charr artifacts

You learn something new every day. I knew about ARC but do not use it. Didn't know it has evolved to a template builder aswell. That said, they allowed it even though they are very strict on external software. Good for them. If I was in their place I probably wouldn't.
---
&gt;ArcDPS introduced it, but it wasn't meant to be in the game up until now. 
---
lol? i love people saying things like theyre fact when they in fact have no clue whatsoever ,then they go on making a strawman argument on it.
---
we used to have build templates in gw 1, and many of us EXPECTED that build templates would be a feature WITH THE LAUNCH OF THE GAME in 2012. then we found out this very BASELINE FEATURE along with GUILD HALLS wasnt a thing AT ALL. it took them up until 2016 to actually give us guild halls, which clearly show they both they had the intention to include them, and also that gw 2 was by all means a very rushed launch and they had to leave out many features that shouldve been in the game from the get go. including build templates.
---
saying they had no intention to include build templates until now is just untrue and an outright lie. makes you look incredibly dishonest.
---
" But don't blame the fact that you are burned out on some QoL changes which you don't like. "
---
 youre using made up facts  to make an argument that suits your narrative.
---
youre gonna have to do a lot better than this if you want anyone to take you seriously.
---
So would you rather have the system keep the gear in your inventory but have unlimited auto-equip sets? Genuinely asking, not trying to "gotcha" or anything
---
You got knowledge in HMLT5 and java Script? I didn't know Guild Wars 2 was a browser game though xD
---
Quite often? Done it daily since launch with magic find boosts and I haven't gotten it once.
---
Maybe they made a mistake deciding not to develop this for launch. Maybe it plain slipped their mind. What I can tell you from a meagre 2 years of producing games is, scoping a game for launch is hard. Stakeholders, deadlines, resources, I don't have the time to get into it but it's not as simple as you make it out to be.
---
This. Exactly this. That's what I take away from the "debate".
---
Well fuck us for wanting something implemented properly instead of this bullshit about there being a cap due to fucky inventory code lmao right
---
Hilarious.
---
I'm not a fan of the upper limits, particularly on gear templates, since I now have to make some hard choices about which of my builds are going to be templates and which I will go back to handling manually.
---
However, I would still much rather use ANet's official templates instead of the ones from arcDPS. I'm actually surprised those were so universally loved. The official ones will at least save on inventory space and they should be easy to use. More players will use them, which is a good thing, and getting more players to use templates is more important to me than my own situation.
---
"Arguments" from players who need 6+ templates:
---
"if you need 50+ build templates, you have no business telling others they shouldn't like it".
---
It's funny, you'd think these supposed veteran players could memorize a couple of traits.
---
Yaknow that's fair, that's prob where our disconnect is, cus I'd prefer to have the equipment be dedicated to a certain build. Touche
---
This is what happens when a good company, with a good idea that's made into a good game, decides that milking dollars out of every aspect of the game take priority over quality.
---
&gt; We paid for the core game when it came out, we bought the expansions when they came out. We supported the game. Everything within the gem store is optional.
---
We all did. We do have the right to complain. Even if you never spent a dime, you can complain.
---
&gt;That is Anet's business model.
---
And since that is their model, we "don't have the right to expect it (complaining) to lead to anything"
---
Unfortunately thats all you have the ability to do. Buy for karma, convert and break down (as it says on gw2efficency) karma to gold is never going to be terribly efficient

---
Describe in single words, only the good things that come into your mind. About your mother.
---
No, arc templates are being disabled when these go live.
---
You don't seem to understand that those minimal things are a huge improvement for some players. And they should be valid no matter what is your opinion.
---
In the case of build templates, the best workaround for this dumb monetization system is if someone creates a website where we can keep all our templates here and just copy and paste it in-game. But, this is still annoying because we could have it in-game for free, but instead, Anet will monetize that which will only make things harder for players who can't keep a web browser open while playing the game. A game that also runs poorly in some hardware already and Anet hasn't done anything to change that in years.  
---
They will also block the further development of ArcDPS Templates which could be used as a workaround for that without the need of an external website.  
---
I really understand how hard it must have been for those devs to work on this "feature", but if they decide to keep things like that, it will only create more problems.
---
I hope Anet comes out and speak with the community about those concerns and they are willing to change it to solve those problems.
---
This is just flat wrong
---
You clearly show you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. Thanks for proofing my point :D
---
I didnt have lege armor and I didnt make small changes. I didnt change sigils in my lege weapons or swap out a few zerk pieces for assassin when changing between raids and fracs. Essentially, arc templates let me actually start having build changes since any gear change, small as well as big, took nothing more than being out of combat and a single click.
---
I main revenant (basically the only character I play) and it‚Äôs a ton of fun. So many different options for play styles and there is a version that is meta in pretty much every game mode so you won‚Äôt feel left out ever
---
So the item I bought is broken down through a salvager perhaps copper fed o matic as I heard it the best. Then I sell the mats from that item to a merchant ?
---
Main issue, imo is not about memorizing the traits, they know them. It's about the ease of swap from one setup to another. Also main issue is more about gear templates rather than build templates. As soon as you need a non obvious stat mix (like a weird/specific mix of Zerk+Assassin or Diviner+Zerk+Assassin) then it becomes a big pain to have to remember all of the combinations for all of the situations for all of the builds (raid, fractal, do you have sportter, does the target have a specific condi, etc) and spend qui some time doing reptitve tasks of manually changing half of your gear to adjust your stats correctly instead of the current equivalent with ArcDPS which can give you this freedom because you are not limited to 6 gear templates.
---
I play every single gamemode, every single class, and have played since launch. But, sure thing dude. Keep living in your delusional bubble.
---
For the current and future strike missions of course!
---
Everyone keeps talking that the invested players are in the wrong here, cause welp fuck them for wanting to play the game at peak performance, but thats not the issue here. 
---
The system intended will not cut player's needs .. the casuals will enjoy it for sure, or people who only play 1 game mode, but if you play all 3 game modes on your main character, the system will already under perform, as it will only allow you one build per mode (unless you pay for one extra build per mode). Admitting you get all 6 slots, then you're restricted to 2 builds per mode, so lets assume 1 build per elite spec. It already falls flat here. 2 elite specs + a core build and you can't fit in the system the basic styles of your class. 
---
And we all know one elite spec only has one build .. Scourge, simplifying it a lot, has 3 (Power, Condi and Heal). 3 Very different builds on the same elite spec.
---
Its just too low, and even if they increase in the future to 10 slots per character, the fact they are character bound will not make players get more of those. 
---
Whats gonna happen is that hardcore players, who already have lots of alt characters, will keep using those and people who only have a few and were looking to finally have a way of extending their gameplay will likely not gonna use the system. 
---
The purpose of the system was to serve as an incentive for experimentation, making you play other builds and other characters, but that's not going to happen.
---
Iirc you buy the items (say 4 gloves as used to be the standard method) then you bring them to the mystic forge and combine them to make a new item which can now be salvaged into mats and sold. 
---
Someone who has done this more recently correct me if im wrong but for core this is the best karma -&gt; gold conversion that i remember.
---
Honestly there's a good chance it wouldn't even be detectable.
---
Gz, nerd.
---
üòÇ
---
You'd be surprised at the amount of trait/gear variations that exist for mesmer.
---
Oh yeah... No they could have done it on thier own forms or email surveys.
---
Reddit is where we go to be pissed at the game and tell everyone who is not ourselves to "fuck off I got mine so it's fine".
---
There are a lot of hardcore players who have invested *significant* amounts of gold into legendary gear that can't be easily shared between alts. They've been using it with arcdps templates to have *more than 6* gear sets on these characters thanks to legendary stat and upgrade swapping.
---
These players are getting smacked down hard. Not only are they getting suck with a big bill to mitigate this issue as much as they can through excessive gem purchases, but they aren't even able to continue playing the game the same way due to the 6 template limit. Alts aren't a good solution because these players have been investing in legendary gear which can't be conveniently transferred between alts in the gear template system.
---
It's not so much about the barrier to new players trying to become hardcore; existing hardcore players are hugely impacted as well.
---
Another option is to pool it up and buy a ton of wintersday gifts
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Wintersday_Gift
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Charity_Corps_Seraph#vendor75
---
Every Christmas, at wintersday event, there is a merchant in Divinity's Reach that sells wintersday gifts for Karma. For 208600 karma you get 100gifts (daily) That comes to about 7g per 100 at TP. But if you sell AFTER wintersday. Prices now and AFTER the event are around 6-7silver per gift. During the event, 4-5silver. So BUY and sell after. OR if you are like me, BUY, keep for 1 year, and then THE FIRST DAY FIRST HOUR for the event, sell for like 7-8-9 or whatever the maniacs will pay for at TP.
---
YOU MAY make more with the buy gloves, Mystic forge, salv, sell mats. BUT PUT A VALUE AT THE  TIME YOU WILL WASTE DOING THAT. Literally! While the gift solution will take you less that 30 secs a day. 
---
Good luck :)
---
I mean, you somehow imply I want that shit for free. If someone imagines things here it's not me...
---
Regarding Memory Essence Encapsulator
---
Is this item getting consumed and disappears from inventory upon achievement objective fulfilling or remains and can be salvaged for components it requires in first place to be created (50 ecto, 10 ori filigree, 1 small vision crystal, 3 xunlai ingots)?
---
see, the issue with that clip particularly is that WP conveniently leaves out the part where they shoehorn 3 distinct monetization methods into a single rather limited (even if fully unlocked) system that has - to our knowledge - some rather significant flaws like e.g. the fact manual changes overwrite the template you have currently equipped.
---
I mentioned in some other comment that yes I am against both forms of gameplay that arise from the current death saves either you die without rolling from a random minion poke, or you ping up and down a stupid amount.
---
The heal on the other hand will work like simple extending of health resources mid fight. When intended for a group with no healer it should extend a time to death by about 30% but with decision on when to use before getting knocked out or maybe even hold till after. It is intended similar to healing potions but without a cost, always available since you gave up having a heal support. 
---
I didn‚Äôt want to make it main action as much as it becomes more disappointing to spend the full turn on it, and you will just take the damage again by next turn, but at this point I agree. I still think 
---
You are right about multiclass, I intended it to be based off first class choice but did not add the text in editing.
---
the copy link thing only works for traits and skills.... not gear
---
If you have the expansions, there are merchants in the new maps that sell TOOLS for MINING,LOGS and PLANTS that ALSO give magic. You can then use that magic when you get enough to buy crates with random mats from merchants that you can sell.
---
I'm kinda paranoid with security so I don't think I'll ever take my account informations outside the game but thanks anyway.
---
"I don't need it, so nobody needs it. Who caters to minorities anyways."
---
Sick of this.
---
With a few thousand gameplay hours I know a little bit, and raiding every weekend just for fun, not even seriously and killing all bosses, and seeing my wealth rise when I do, is more than proof enough that you get more than just shit. Of course there are faster ways, no one forces players to raid in order to get gold. There, you even just mentioned ways of getting fast and easy gold, which in turn means, again, free slots.
---
Oh and prices have not been disclosed, but since you seem to know more than everyone else, tell us more.
---
Oh no! Someone else figured out my money-making super-secret method!!! :)
---
Yeah didn't they spin this during the announcement that it was to reward our most loyal and hardcore players?
---
you first my man
---
&gt; Good thing nobody cares about gw2 outside of gw2.
---
thanks to the community
---
But is it enough that you couldn't just have four or so "base" builds that the others stem from? It wouldn't be as perfect as having one for each, but it'd still significantly reduce the total time to switch if you just have a Chrono support, Chrono tank, power, condi set, and then just change the minor bits as you have to. That'd even be an improvement over arcdps since arcdps couldn't change gear, only traits. I dunno, I'm just trying to find some way to appease everyone while still allowing Anet to make money so they can continue developing this game
---
It only uses a code given to you by ANet and your public name, you know the ‚Äòpoolsnotclosed.1234‚Äô. It‚Äôs completely safe, can only recommend it.
---
i'm assuming the discretize build recommends strength runes for a group without a healbrand, just the power quickbrand. so if your groups have a healbrand (mos pugs do imo) you should be fine with scholar or thief, depending on how much precision you need to hit crit cap
---
None asked for infinite gear slots, all we want is legendary gear remaining their value, enabling you to **freely** swap your stats **without** restrictions and not becoming more or less worthless what you worked hard for when anet just sells this legendary feature via the gemstore now...
---
Suggesting absurd prices because you are either rich or wouldn' buy them either way... nice
---
In the new living world maps you can farm volatile magic and spend it to buy shipments, you get double de return in materials, 1gold -&gt; 2 gold. You can farm volatile doing everything on the maps and you can even buy volatile tools for karma that give you volatile magic while gathering etc
---
A "No, you!" response? Really?! The best you got is "No, you"?
---
Try getting better at trolling before actually trolling.
---
Fair enough, excepting the dodge action I think most of the same could have been applied to WoW back when GW2 was released, I agree the percentile calculation doesn‚Äôt much feel like 5e so I‚Äôll likely change that, thanks for feedback!
---
Honestly after seeing people say shit like "UHHHHHH I need ATLEAST 30 slots for my toughness chrono, slightly-less-toughness chrono, slightly-less-tougness chrono but with 1 item being some random affix, dps chrono, slightly more dps chrono"...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. etc. I'm also very inclined to call BS. I don't even give a shit about the monetization, sure I'm down with it all being free but wanting literal 50 loadouts? I'm PRETTY sure people can make do with less and taking out 1-2 gears for that SLIGHTLY altered chrono.   
---
Not only is min-maxing like that not in the least bit required it's flat out autism by this point. I'm usually on board with most of the communities outrage with certain things and while I do agree this is a cashgrab, I don't agree with people crying that they need to click more buttons. That's flat out laughable and jouvenile af. A lot of MMOs don't even have build templates and a lot that do you can't change them just whenever you want and out of combat.   
---
A couple of clicks don't kill people in other MMOs, why would it kill you in this one? If somebody is willing to bother with 8 iterations of toughness chrono then I'm sure they'll survive having to click buttons ;)
---
Wait, it was a secret?  My bad.  Been saving up my Karma for 10 months now...minus that one unfortunate incident when I was impulsive while standing in front of a T3 cultural vendor.
---
you bet your ass im not buying a single one of those. id rather swap out my gear manually (i have memorized all of them at this point) than paying for a qol feature that should be free. if youre buying it - your supporting it, and youre essentially saying "no matter what you throw at me, im gonna shut the fuck up and take it".
---
Wow, wtf? I can't believe Massively reported that. The community is not grumpy. There are some people unhappy (mostly leeches), as there will always be, but the great majority is very pleased. Just look at the thread here. 94% upvote.
---
The game has existed for 7 years without build templates, so no you really don't \*\*need\*\* it. You want it, but you don't need it.
---
Ever heard of something called subjectivity? A lot of people would say the very same about GW2.
---
The cap is 6
---
A thief can technically keep up or be faster then the warclaw mount if the thief truly tried. Short bow + shadow step + signet of agility + dodging. Not extremely faster but it can outrun a warclaw slowly
---
Man, people understand that sadly, Arenanet is not a non-profit. Development time costs money.
---
The servers where your data is to be processed costs money.
---
Databases where your info is to be stored costs money. You can't expect to have everything for free. Hell, they're even giving a few slots for free. People complaining are mostly leeches (who go by converting gold to gems and never invests real money in game) and some people with 20 alts. I feel it for he laters, but if you have 30 builds, invest some money.
---
Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of how having alts and how alt friendly the game is?
---
You need to spend at least 95‚Ç¨ to make the template system usable
---
You have enough of an idea to state an opinion, a guess.  You're the one who wants to keep arguing for it as if it is fact, as if your opinion invalidates mine.
---
Oh, but they WILL see a difference in the final product. Deroir's statement is difference enough, and he won't be the only one. Just wait to see the actual outcry if they release the templates like this.
---
I can't even begin to tell you how much easier it is to create a gem store item than to code an entire new system. They're not even remotely comparable.
---
The thing they are claiming needs monetization build templates giving "free bag space" is not actually relevant to most who actually care about build templates, for one you dont swap 15-17+ pieces of gear for every single build you want to use.
---
And 2nd noone asked for those "free storage space" in favor for extremely limiting the number of builds we can use to only 6.
---
Also this system will massively downgrading legendary gear, with just putting the legendary feature in the gemstore now, as well as limiting the freedom you had before with them for years.
---
When you develop a new feature for your costumers you should provide something better from what was there before, not delivering a downgrade while expecting that players will pay premium for it.
---
Thing is that your client is only able to load one character/database entry at a time.  So you only ever have access to what's in your inventory, never anything in the inventory of your other characters.
---
We have been waiting YEARS for this and we cap out at 6, which is far too few, especially for certain classes, not to mention if more elite specs come out.
---
Lmao
---
Because people use multiple builds and gear setups for different game modes. And if you run multiple characters you will have to pay big gems and could still easily run out of room.
---
At least he is streaming GW2. Not like some new GW2 partners that have received Aurene's outfit codes and when you follow their twitch channel they stream WoW and every other game but GW2. These are the players that say nothing and are happy whatever Anet does. They are just busy enjoying other games and do not care about GW2 like some of us do.
---
....and do not worry, people are leaving, not only threatening . 85% of my friend list does not play GW2 any more. Some even do not log in for a new episode.
---
That's a lie, at least in this subreddit. Every time something negative happens so many people have to come by and chime in with "I quit X time ago and this new update sucks".
---
Reward with that sense of achievement like Activision does.
---
Ok cool, I missed that.
---
Because a small portion of the player has 247 different templates in a 3rd party addon called ArcDPS, and last we checked Anet's going to stop tolerate it once they implement their own version. So people lose all their unlimited slots in exchange of three slots plus paid additional ones which completely fucking obliterates all the QoL people enjoyed for the last few years.
---
&gt; Bc anytime something is an issue that doesn't necessarily bother them too much people who are bothered by it are "whiny" or can go play a different game.
---
Yes, because people are dumb. Today they tell raiders to leave and they go. Tomorrow the wvw players complaining about the derelict state of their gamemode leave to fanfare from people who are "sick of whiners". Next go the folks disappointed by lack of new content and constant stream of cash shop items. Who is going to be left in the game then? Folks who log in for 3 hours once every 5 months for the story?
---
Yes. You can make more with gloves but instead of 15mins total for all 10mil karma, it will take you MANY MANY MANY hours.
---
Just for reference, a world boss tour run for 1 hour (Including TeQ and Karka) will give you 4-5g total not taking in account if you get ascended gear or rear drop. You will not get anything more with the glove method.
---
I recommend you do 2-3 mil in gloves and IF YOU ARE NOT BORED TO DEATH AFTER THAT, do the rest. Do that soon though so if you decide to go for the gift method, you don't miss this year's event.
---
This video pretty much wraps it up.. even if you are not a hardcore player the template system is by design unusable unless you spend money on it.
---
https://youtu.be/ekp0NtBBIu8
---
No, just pointing out that no one at that level is going to "wave a wallet", unless they already do that regularly. 
---
I'm not gonna deny that some raiders, depending on what builds they regularly use, will be inconvenienced by only have 6 max equipment templates available. I'm just trying to keep it to reasonable arguments here, because there's a lot of frickin hyperbole and pearl clutching going on the last two days. "But think of the poor raiders, they'll have to spend money!" is pretty weak, honestly. These are the same people who use 1g food because it gives like 10 more stats and complain that there's nothing worthwhile to spend money on once you've gotten your full legendary gear; they'll be fine, money-wise.
---
The Office?
---
All true. There are, after all, convenience items. I would not look to them for profit - or even consider them if I'm planning to save up the gold for something else.
---
That's great, I've heard people say that for 7 years now. The game is fine and will stay fine without those players. But let's be real, they're coming right back, because they're dependent on the game, not the other way around.
---
I see I see ! THANK YOU MAN :D
---
I'll check it out! Gotta spend roughly few million Karma lol
---
maybe read the threads and then you know instead of making another one.
---
That was EA though :p
---
Yes. They are developed for the majority that will take the journey and may or not finish the game.
---
And for those players 6 builds are more than enough. Your point?
---
Paying for a feature that was deleted of the base game in order to make it a money grab IS pay to win
---
And 2 right don't make a wrong a third right, Anet do a lot of good thing, but it's no reason to not catch them on their bullshit.
---
Especially when a lot of people were waiting for icebrood, build template and what might follow to be an extension, and i would have gladly bought it
---
Only the base game is free to play, and the rest is buy to play. Which honestly is the ONLY way they could of possibly gone with. Content is released so incredibly slow it'd never be able to sustain people on a subscription based model.   
---
I do play other games, and yes, compared to some games it's better(example: every EA game in existence /s). But it's still pretty awful considering the "End Game" is GW2 is the cash shop. It's a virtual mall simulator at this point.
---
I'm doing great except that it's still summer temps outside and it's freaking October. How's your fall going?
---
Otherwise I'm looking forward to build templates cause I never bothered with Arc and just made extra characters for other builds.
---
&gt; These chat links can also be copied and pasted out of the game and back into it from your clipboard, making trying a new build from another player or an external website a breeze.  
---
From the blog post
---
You're so passionate
---
Ya, I have completed all achievements and the reward track in both spvp and wvw already.
---
I am fully geared out on all my characters with each unique "currency" (aka gatherable stuff of each map) stacked to 2000 in storage. The rest I am just converting to VM.
---
Are the LS4-Reward Tracks still the best - gold wise? With the shipments and the additional VM?
---
This sucks, but they gave a clear explanation as to why this can't work. In the database backend, the gear in your inventory/equipped is tied to each character not to account and since they weren't allow to touch the inventory code (with good reason, a bad semi-colon somewhere could erase an entire user's inventory) that relationship in the database schema can't be changed. Databases are the most integral, yet scary, thing in any application as a corrupted database, bad relationship, or simple mistake can break the entire application.
---
They forget the point that if you can afford 10 ascended sets and need that many builds, you more than likely have plenty of gold to convert to gems anyhow.
---
It disappears after use. You can't just recycle the same one sadly.
---
This response seems a bit detached from your initial post. Your statement of:
---
&gt;**Everything** in the game needs to be paid for somehow 
---
was presented in a way which made it sound like the players both owe ANet and that our purchase of the game was not support itself. While it remains true that we do no have subscription fees in GW2, that dose not mean we owe them what they could have collected if there was one. They chose this business model; they are not owed for that "potential" from using a different business model. The fact of the matter is that they are not owed support either. The company will live and die based off of their decisions as a company. They are not entitled to our money or support. They create a product and consumers decide if they want to purchase it.
---
&gt;But I also think it's reasonable to determine that thousands of hours across 7 years of added content (if we liked or call it content is a different discussion) and maintenance deserve the price of core and expansions at least.
---
I feel like F2P games throw a massive monkey wrench in that line of logic as well. Path of Exile, Warframe, League of Legends ‚Äî probably some of the biggest entries in their genres are all free to play and are regularly updated. Warframe even takes a step closer to GW2 where, if a player chooses, they can obtain everything in the game for free by trading with other players for the equivalent of the Gem currency. Path of Exile monetizes a lot of convenience features for inventory management but many of those convenience purchases are one-time only (such as the Currency and Map tabs) though they also provide a lot of cosmetics (at what I think are ridiculous prices). League of Legends mostly locks monetization around skins and obtaining new characters but have also added free to play ways to earn those over time.
---
Again: They are not entitled to or owed anything. They provided a product or service and consumers chose to make a purchase or not. You can try to calculate the potential of if they had used a different business model, but ultimately that's just conjecture. Try thinking about it from the other perspective: Do you think it makes sense to consider what FFXIV would be like if they chose not to charge a subscription after launching ARR in 2013?
---
&gt;Where I live (and I suspect this is EU law), companies are legally defined as service or product providers, and acting towards the sole goal of generating profit.
---
Which brings us full circle:
---
&gt;We paid for the core game when it came out, we bought the expansions when they came out. We supported the game.
---
You pay Reddit with your exposure to ads (unless you use an adblocker). You also generate content on it by posting and drawing in other users to be exposed to those ads. You also help bolster communities which can be used to advertise or promote things. 
---
You pay Google with your exposure to ads and offer them data points for improving their algorithm for better services *and* selling user data to potential advertisers.
---
You paid for your copy of Microsoft Windows. There's no subscription for it, yet you've used it for how many years now? How much would you owe them if they charged a subscription? If they charged for every update? (tangent: man I really don't think MS365 is worth that sub cost ‚Äî I just stick to google docs or libreoffice personally)
---
You are paying for Mozilla, actually. Even their [official FAQ](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/faq/) states that user data is being collected. While they're not selling this data the way Reddit or Google would, it's still being published. But, regardless, using that "potential" line of thought, if you've been using it for this long and other alternatives do sell that data, do you feel like you owe it to them to let them sell your data?
---
Guild Wars 2 is a product created by ArenaNet. Whether or not they could have made more money doing x, y, or z doesn't really matter because at the end of the day *this* is what they did.
---
We're not owed anything in regards to potential and neither are they.
---
The people who spend more time playing are given a reason to pay more. How unreasonable...
---
Well it's more that I'm gonna buy a the pack with the unbreakable tools and extra character slot cause I need both but it also comes with a level 80 boost so wondering should I use it or not
---
Didn't say anything about the game being dead. Maybe playerbase will shrink in the next few years but enough will stay. I do think it will become more of a fringe game though, since Twitch and YouTube presence are becoming increasingly involved in a games success.
---
&gt;blend together into a meaningless blob of negativity, obscuring the actual problems.
---
this is an actual problem you cumbrain
---
you think the negativity around this is unwarranted?
---
Yea thief can. Before I got the mount and I was using thief I kept up with the people on mounts and that was without agility. So I could see it out run a mount. Another class I think could out run a warclaw is mesmer. Not as frequent as thief but it def can. Blink + mimic + jaunt
---
its not just about the price it also only allowing 6 max slots
---
That which was previous free and unlimited now costs money and is limited.
---
I like the [Bladed armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bladed_armor) set for any armor class.
---
As for weapons, [Favor of the Colossus](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Favor_of_the_Colossus).
---
I don't think they did, it's just not a very good point.
---
If the lvl 80 boost is "extra" anyway, then just use it? Obviously it will make the map completion faster. Also you can play around with all skills at once, if you are interested in that.
---
If you are a new player with little to no experience in endgame, then maybe save the boost for later. Other than that, go for it.
---
I believe so. Unbound magic is not as good in comparison.
---
Gift of Battle for WvW. Legendaries = money. Sell/trade them. They are the defacto currency for the TP Barons. (Yes I know you have many but others reading will see this).
---
Domain of Istan for sPvP since it gives 250 Map Currency at the end instead of 25 like all other Episode Tracks.
---
I'm using it to practice builds, like support druid.
---
Or just running DPS Deadeye :p
---
Maybe they could also give some of these crazy build count players a bulk discount
---
I agree, the logic is so backwards, it's actually quite dystopian people take it as an argument.
---
Are they not seeing this thinking in monetization is not built on a stable foundation? It's volatile as fuck. The longest running and most stable MMOs have a sub-fee. Simple as that.
---
I have to be honest that trip down memory lane made me LOL!
---
You deleted too late!
---
An the people who already spent money on bag slots to accommodate gear switching can just spend some more for a worse version. It's their own fault for already paying for a service, right?
---
If I dont play open world, what did pof offer me?
---
&gt; As a software developer the idea gives me solidarity headaches for the poor people who would have to implement it.
---
Uhm. The worst part is actually already there.
---
Now, how can legendary slots be done easily with all that's already done?
---
* Step 1: make sure every gear piece exists in legendary rarity - including all rings, infusions and breather.
---
* Step 2: make a slot sub type that has a filter on input function - it only allows "legendary" rarity to be put there.
---
And bam - there it is, you only need 60 item slots of armory storage *total* (which supposedly is the main technical limitation) for any extra amount of legendary-only-slots.
---
Trade in bag slots for equipment slots.
---
So they are already sponsoring anet by playing a lot and they desire ever more? That is not exactly how basic decency works.
---
Gw2 radial will probably do something about it like they did with mounts and novelties.
---
What do you mean deleted? They never had it to begin with.
---
Can be dodged.
---
Can hide behind a tree/wall to make it obstructed. 
---
Can be blocked by Aegis.
---
I have not tried reflect yet. Would be funny, since it dismounts both you and the target, if you reflect it, it should still dismount you and the caster? Or does the caster dismounts himself only? Someone will test this soon.
---
I only have one character, with one build, so templates are useless to me, but for who need them, good I guess?
---
There are application limitations with what they can do with the equipment templates. Largely centred around the inventory code (they were explicit in that they were *not allowed* to touch the inventory code). I don't doubt they will eventually expand the amount of tabs a character can have, but before they do that, they need to know how hundreds (potentially thousands) of players making changes to an Equipment template will affect database performance on release. If the DB goes down, the game goes down
---
...huh
---
How we just don't nuke ArcDPS? Ingame templates are faster and less fussy, but are limited in numbers. ArcDPS is a bit fickle and needs to be updated all the time and takes forever to switch all your shit and whatnot, but has an unlimited amount of slots.
---
What fuckers downvote Blade Runner references?
---
why should Anet give u anything for free?
---
you can buy more template slots for money or gold. whats the problem? 
---
this is a fucking Buy2Play game. you don't have to pay for content updates and now you're crying because you have to pay for some template slots? stfu ... this community is so fucking awful.
---
Because right now I can have 30000000000 build templates per character.
---
I agree WvW and PvP didn't get as much attention and don't and it's really sad those game modes don't get a lot of love. At least PvP still gets some updates, slow and steady, the platform for tournaments and rewards is nice now
---
So people like me.
---
What's the problem?
---
That works too, but refunds have to be manual, so far more work for ArenaNet; if they can be properly refunded in the first place, too.
---
Gw1 equipment also didnt have stats, stats (attributes) were part of your build.
---
Just ANOTHER example why stats on gear was a terrible decision for gw2
---
all the data available points towards it as the logical conclusion, literally nothing points towards a different conclusion. call it a guess, stamp your feet and say there isn't enough data available all you want, anyone who thinks about it and ignores their bias for a single second will realise that it is what is going on. if this was a peer reviewed journal or some shit, of course i'd need to get more concrete data from anet even if everyone knew it was true, but this isn't a peer reviewed journal and i have no way of obtaining any more information, the only thing i have access to is what is publicly available. it is dishonest to use that as an excuse to pretend like you actually have a case. you can't invalidate an opinion because many are wrong, including yours, you however seem to think that the lack of 100 % accurate data from anet invalidates *all* the other information that points towards my conclusion, which is silly.
---
&gt;  and seeing my wealth rise when I do, is more than proof enough 
---
It's an average of 3 gold per kill.
---
You need to kill **11 bosses** to get the same gold you'd get from **a single hour of dragonfall farming**.
---
Now here's the 2 big differences:
---
1. If you're claiming you kill 11 bosses an hour, while playing "not even seriously", then you're lying. 
---
2. Raids have a weekly limit of 1 boss kill per week, farming dragonfall does not. Meaning you have a maximum hard-cap of how much gold you'd get from Raiding per week.
---
3. Raids actually require you to think, and you'll fail relatively often, specially with pugs, greatly inflating the time to kill, reducing gold gain... Dragonfall on the other hand, you can turn your brain off &amp; run around pressing 1.
---
If you genuinely believe Raiding is a good source of income compared to farming metas with your brain switched off, you're insane. The numbers speak for themselves. Raiding is inefficient, but raiders continue doing it because it's more fun than running around a map in a meta.
---
&gt; Of course there are faster ways, no one forces players to raid in order to get gold.  
---
Exactly... So why the fuck would you claim " raiders get rewards all the time and can easily and fairly quick convert gems to gold"... When literally **anyone** in the game doing **anything** in the game gets pretty much comparable gold? Why specifically call our Raiders for this, when their income is on the lower end of Gold/Hour? It makes no sense.
---
Specially considering raiders need to fucking **spend money** on food to actually raid.
---
&gt; Oh and prices have not been disclosed, but since you seem to know more than everyone else, tell us more. 
---
Even if it's 200 gems per slot (which is laughably low compared to Anets history, it'll realistically be 400), it'll still cost me over a thousand gold or 40ish dollars... For something **i already currently have for free**.
---
\-
---
It's hilarious that people are trying to justify this. Have fun continuing to eat the shit Anet is feeding you, while claiming it's delicious, and telling everyone that's unhappy about it that they shouldn't argue.
---
bree is like this subreddit though. she is only commenting on gw2 when she has something bad to sya or post.
---
How much experience do you have in large database schemas, relational databases, client/server applications, cloud/datacenter architectures, scaling, memory management? 
---
This game isn't written in HTML5 (which isn't a programming language, BTW). Some may be written in Javascript, but I doubt it as Electron was young when GW2 was being developed.
---
The technical limitations are definitely there, especially once you factor in the backend Database complications AND the fact that they were NOT ALLOWED to touch the character inventory code.
---
This could work as a non-intrusive monetization model for the system. I would love making different looks if they could be saved and changed at ease. Now I just have 150 transmutation charges sitting unused cause i can't be arsed to mix and match/remember what skins looked good with what.
---
It might be 50 for all the others, but I know Istan is (currently) the exception.
---
It seems that by rephrasing our points of view it became clear that we're more in agreement than initially seemed.
---
I'm with you: we owe nothing to Anet. It was an agreement that we wouldn't have to pay a dime aside from core content and expansions. No one should feel pressured to buy gems now, under any circumstances, and it's perfectly fine for a player to never spend added money, while other players chose to do so (I myself played for 7 years without paying for anything). That was the contract. 
---
I also agree that I owe Mozilla (or any of the others) nothing. When they add a paid service that I want, I'll pay and frame that cost as general support for the whole product I've been using for years. This is what I do with gems, and is what I was suggesting others do if they want extra template slots but feel they're not up to par in implementation - a sort of "think of it as general support", but always, ALWAYS, if you want to. This is where my argument (that Everything has to be paid for somehow) was supposed to fit: we can think of our gems as support for the whole of the game and not as approval of a specific feature. Maybe it's a psychological gimmick 
---
Now, I totally understand that for a specific group of players, these templates are not only insufficient but actually disruptive, as you put it. I'm not pretending it's flawless. Anet will forever prioritize the majority, that's another of their choices as a company. There's really no consolation for those that happen to be in the minority, unfortunately.
---
"train wreck", "trashfire". always this exaggeration on this sub.
---
To clarify, I don't have an issue with legendary gear being stuck on a single character, at least for the purposes of automated build swapping. My point is that *because* it works that way, the 6 template limit royally screws anyone who used legendary gear to manage a large number of builds.
---
Can't have more than 6 builds on one character, and can't share legendary gear between multiple characters. You can't win with ANet's proposed system.
---
i have so many builds in templates right now, where i copied builds from yt or metabuild's, copied and renamed them for different circumstances for different weapon loadouts or zerg taging. then something broke and gear templates dont work anymore (maybe cus i changed runes and sigils without overwriting)
---
tbh i will wipe the slate clean when the official templates arrive and look for new builds. my old builds might not be optimal anymore anyway.
---
I mentioned I don't argue about that. You are absolutely right. That doesn't mean it's another game mode though.
---
He's not threatening, he's stating a simple fact. He's not even doing anything that's egocentric, he just tweeted it for his followers that he's going to be leaving the game because of being disappointed and fed up with it and somebody else posted it to reddit. The literal definition of the word 'egocentric' is to think only of yourself with lack of regard for others. To use it in this context makes no sense because he isn't doing anything at the expense of anyone else.
---
Or I could keep switching stuff manually for free. So template slots should be free, too.
---
You my friend, are doing the legions work!
---
The op said the goal of the system should be to play on one character (class) so my comment is a vast improvement.
---
That would just be infuriating always having a flashing Aegis on your bar. There has to be a way to just remove the Aegis when the virtue is removed.
---
A druid is primarily support, so your damage isn't going to be nearly as good as condi or power soulbeast. 
---
That being said, tagging shit is pretty easy because you get contribution for healing your teammates. Point your little pew pew laser at a mob and heal/laserbeam your enemies.
---
They should just keep ArcDPS available to keep those with ~200 templates saved happy. Maybe they'll try the in-game ones and still use them for a few builds. Heck, they may even eventually like the in-game system more after updates/gemstore sales and completely transition.

I feel like there's a very small number of players (Reddit is a fraction of the player base) that uses ArcDPS, or even know what it is. The casuals and folks that don't like/know about the add-on will be satisfied with the new feature, because it's better than what's available in-game now. The 'hardcore' players can keep their 40 chrono builds with ArcDPS.
---
I've never bothered with add-ons, due to my own fears (I feel like anyone can get banned for anything these days). I'll be utilizing the in-game templates, out of ease of mind and convenience. 
---
Just an opinion too, I feel like the monetization of templates is due to NCSoft West. I think far too often people are ready to raise pitch forks at ArenaNet, but completely ignore their parent company that will always have their hands in what's going on in the game, especially when it comes to making a profit out of resources used to fulfill a fan requested feature.
---
&gt; hoping for them to revert the change 
---
i'm curious now - has the balance team ever actually reverted any big class changes like this before? i've heard of plenty of balance patches which have made things clunky or completely upset class playstyles, but i can't recall if they've ever admitted to making a poor choice and reverting those changes
---
Back when PoF launched and Hall of Chains was all the rage, I absolutely spent a lot of time talking the game up to people I knew.
---
These days I'm doing the game a favor by not talking about it to people because I don't have many good things to say.
---
Also, I'm not sure how it's somehow the community's fault that ANet never advertised the game. Granted they seem to have tried a bit more recently, but there wasn't really any content to advertise so it all seemed pretty pointless.
---
I 100% agree with this if they made these gear templates account bound instead of character bound I would be more willing to swollow this.
---
I think you miss those that need build templates, but for which the proposed system would be sufficient or almost so with just a few bought slots.
---
This is the result of not having players involved in the development proccess. Remember when anet added to the materials storage a lot of new items, and it was the players giving tons of feedback and suggestions of which items should be there. That was great.  
---
However, most of the time we just get a "here it's, like WE want it. If you don't want it is your problem". I wish there was a public Beta or something.
---
Which means you don't need templates.  Which necessarily means you were not the player asking for this feature to begin with.  
---
The players who have been asking for it for years *are the ones who needed it* for the reasons outlined in this post, which details how those exact players are getting shafted by its implementation.
---
Another likely long-time player who doesn't understand they're **playing a transaction-based game.**  Here's an idea - if you don't want to spend ~~$60 USD~~ some chunk of money that you've merely speculated the sum of for enough build template slots to accommodate your eeeeeeeeeevery desire, then **BUY. FEWER. BUILD. TEMPLATE. SLOTS!**
---
A "semi-hardcore" player should recognize and appreciate the fact that all the *free* content we get from ArenaNet isn't free for ArenaNet to create.  It's a product of years of professional training and months of technical development, and it costs a lot of money.
---
Consider being grateful for players that *do* spend a shitload of money in the gem store and subsidize the build template feature and slots that you're already being given for **FREE**.  You know - the new feature you're complaining about based on speculation.
---
The point is gw1 didn't include gear because it did not need to. The functionality of gw2 gear was included on the player and was separate from the inventory system so it was safe to save in builds. Yes, runes could boost the attributes, they could lower hp grant how and grant energy too, but the fact that everything attributes did was removed and placed solely on gear, as well as bloat that across more than double the amount of items grossly exacerbated the problem. Thus the implied argument of "didn't have gear in templates in gw2, dont need it in gw2" is invalid. 
---
Gw2 forces gear to be part of the build by taking a ~25% statistical increase and grossly bloating it to what, 400% or more if you include quad stats and the interactions those stats have that make all skills scale hyperbolically, where theres an inconceivable delta between offensive and non offensive stats all spread amongst 228% more items. The fact that each piece of gear is 8 times more numerically impactful on skill effectiveness makes it clear that any system must include them for completeness
---
that picture makes me sad, reminds me of the good days of when the game was alive and well.
---
You are correct, but the person in initial comment said they wanted one set for everything, so I assumed that they wanted to use same gear as the build shown in the video and thus use Balthazar runes.
---
What is it then?
---
May you and your meme die in a fire.
---
My guess is that Anet learned from previous player drama over nothing. No matter what they will do, people will complain.
---
So internally, they already decided to give players 3 build templates per player. But if they would offer players 3 build templates right from the announcement of the launch date, players would still complain that 3 arent enough.
---
So now, they start with offering 2 for free even though they already decided that gear templates will shi with 3 free slots, which they will reveal right before it goes live.
---
The complainers are happy because they think their complaining made a difference and everybody happy when it launches.
---
Same difference.
---
Ok so you're happy with the changes. And now can you start thinking about others who play more than you and see problems? Maybe they're right ? Maybe it's deserved ? Maybe you'll see theses problems later.  
---
Take a time to understand others point of view. It's called empathy and it will help in your life.
---
Everyone should have seen this coming with the way they treated BGDM/Bhagawan
---
Of the many I have been booting up this month for research gw2 has no problem.
---
I agree. The people comparing them and saying GW1 didn't have the equipment part that GW2 does don't really understand why GW1 didn't have it. It wasn't necessary because gear played a much smaller part of it. As a ranger with a bunch of different builds, I don't think I ever really changed my gear unless it was for something extremely niche, and then it was only to get rid of a marksmanship rune and replace it with a vigor one.
---
So when they expand the cap in the future I'll consider this a job well done. For now, it's a half-assed money grab and nothing more.
---
Lick my fuzzy cuddle balls :&gt;
---
Wait, did we actually get a confirmation of Anet that they're going to fuck us and that's it?
---
The official statement is that they're internally working on the pricing but expect it to be priced in a similar range to other inventory options, i.e. bag slots/bank expansions, which are 400 and 600 gems, respectively.  Assuming they'll be ~400 is not an arbitrary number.  It's an educated speculation based on the information they gave us.
---
I don‚Äôt even see an article in my scrolling through their mmorpg feed about the release of the prologue, much less an interview with the devs responsible for the Metal Legion concert design (which has been hailed by players as the most fun event they‚Äôve experienced in gw2). I feel like massively posts more heavily negative press for gw2, which turns away potential new players. Not to say these things shouldn‚Äôt be talked about, they should; but posting only bad news is bad for everyone.
---
I'm already planning to have a sort of Estus Flask be something the party can acquire relatively early on, a session or two in. 
---
This is a necessity considering the party layout is going to be pure physical damage with nary a drop of healing, and I still want to be able to field challenging encounters without having to pull punches to navigate their lack of sustain.
---
I think that, and adding dodge roll+down state will have given them enough advantages that I can still design nice encounters without necessarily playing to their strengths.
---
For the general player though, this number makes sense. I do wish that there was 3 equipment templates baseline instead of 2, as this would give parity with the build templates. For most players, each class will have three main playstyles: power, Condi, support. The build template reflects this and I wish the equipment template would too. 
---
However, you don't need a separate build templates for every possible niche scenario and build. Unless you are above opening the Hero Panel like the peasants to manually make a minor change, in which case maybe you do need a dozen build/equipment templates. The difference between a low and high toughness support chrono is minor after all and you will do what you always did: keep it in your bag and swap as you need.
---
Long story short, You don't need a template for every build on snow crows and metabattle At the very least, see this as ANet removing some friction in your gameplay and clutter in your inventories, rather than a shameless ploy to make money.
---
Maybe they want the game to fail so NCSoft shuts it down and they can keep working on their other projects ü§î
---
That's just for exotic gear though, I'd suggest taking a look at [this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) and see what your options are for getting ascended trinkets or even magi stats until you're ready to upgrade. To answer your question though they drop from the chest in the [oasis JP](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sanctum_of_Nabkha), the [desert forgotten chests](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grand_Forgotten_Chest), [Buried treasure](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Buried_Treasure), and upgrading from [black diamonds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Diamond) (not worth it imo).
---
Too little too late Anet. Might sound harsh but that's my opinion on this.
---
Just a different part of it. Along the same lines you could argue lots of dungeons need their own build, not only fractals, but groups of fractals and/or instabs need their own build. Just because it's instanced and benefits a lot from a different build means it would be a separate mode. PvE just means it's players against the environment, essentially AI. That's what all of those are. Both WvW and PvP are a whole lot different in that respect.
---
And yes, I agree that determining the needed number of build slots from the number of games modes does not make a lot of sense. I guess this just stems from the fact that in effect you always had different build templates for different modes already - just no one really called them that.
---
I think if you're going to shame someone for bad business practices you should get their name right so you don't accidentlaly let them off the hook
---
It's only a problem if you aren't going full Fashion Wars 2 with them
---
Nice, or just put berserk in one template for any content when you play dps, and one support role :thinking: i am sure you are using other builds rarely enough so you can just click it.
---
Without theses tools people will just leaves the game faster. Without buildtemplate i would not have tried so much builds, i would not have crafted legendary gear, ...
---
Not great if you're building it as a proper healer. Getting a cheap power set would be better so you can have some damage. In general you want damage in open world so you just kill things outright instead of spend 10 min healing and chipping away at it. You take 0 damage if you just kill things right away :)
---
Not from Anet but from the developer. The agreement was that when Anet released their official version, Delta (the developer) would discontinue development.
---
Hardcore is such a broad term and a Lot of people fall under the category even if they are "casual" from a raiders perspective
---
Yet it will be the "hardcore veterans" that will play this game until the servers shut down. Even if the current "hardcore" group move on someone else will take up that mantle. There are "hardcore raiders, "Hardcore PvPers", "Hardcore open world players" you name it someone will "hardcore" it
---
Just here to answer your question.
---
raids is full zerker, scholar, force, impact or air on s/s s/f
---
open world is likely assassins, pack rune, bloodlust, air, fire, maybe frenzy, gs and s/x
---
quite a big change, but keep in mind you'd notice virtually no difference btwn the two though and making a template specifically for open world is silly in like 99% of the cases presented in this thread including this one.
---
&gt;And at the end of the list of features "All of these content updates, features, and QOL improvements continue to be given for free with no monthly subscription fee."
---
That didn't age well.
---
didn‚Äôt they have keybinds for weapons though? Seems along the same lines to me (since as u/glytchypoo stated stats were gained primarily through your build)
---
&gt; That's just for exotic gear though, I'd suggest taking a look at this guide and see what your options are for getting ascended trinkets or even magi stats until you're ready to upgrade.
---
I am aware on how to get the ascended ones, but I am grinding for my ascended trinkets for 6 characters at the moment, so I want to get harrier's exotics to hold it's place for now for some characters.
---
&gt;To answer your question though they drop from the chest in the oasis JP, the desert forgotten chests, Buried treasure, and upgrading from black diamonds (not worth it imo).
---
Thanks!
---
If the new storage system is so problematic and limiting, why not just keep using normal inventory and hand out a bag slot increase?
---
WvW dead in comparison of what it use to be
---
Oh ye, so you have to swap the build in 0,5s or your raid training group filled mostly with regulars will wipe for 10th time on VG. /facepalm
---
Action economy and death saves do have this sort of interaction, yeah. 
---
A few sessions back we were fighting a Solar (one that thankfully didn't have its instakill bow) and I got absolutely trashed by a crit, went down, but I realized that death was quite literally impossible. Every other party member came before me in initiative, and every one of them had healing available. I'd only have been in danger if literally everyone at the table ignored me. Even the Solar using LAs to hit my body wouldn't have been enough to chew me out before SOMEONE could pick me up. 
---
5e is funky that way.
---
Hm. Wrong link? I don't see a dev comment.
---
Sacrifice a purchased bag slot to gain an equipment slot
---
I was completely under the impression it would not work like that, that build/gear templates would work as "saved presets" and that you could activate them (changing your skills and gear) and from there you could swap things without changing the saved template, and when you wanted to roll into the saved build again, you would just do it. If there is no way to change your gear and build without impacting your saved template... that is truly disappointing.
---
Who honestly expected them to be free? Aren't you at least happy that you get some for free? Those developers need to get paid after all.
---
Don't laugh, but I literally have all of mine drawn out front and back on a sheet of printer paper. It's ghetto as hell, but it's what I had to do to remember which ones I use for various occasions.
---
Pepehands
---
the problem is professional redditors can't accept monetization out of spite, even if it doesn't impact them financially whatsoever
---
they will pull out some nonsense such as "it's the intention that counts" or idk
---
it's made even more ridiculous when literally everything else is monetized from bag slots to mount skins but this is where the beautiful and so so brave reddit enthusiasts draw the line!
---
\&gt;graverunning  
---
Go back to WoW Classic
---
I fully comprehend that; to quote my earlier comment:
---
&gt;Build Templates are probably the least risky example
---
I'm well aware that storing Build Templates locally is, in the grand scheme of things, quite safe, but it still isn't an ideal solution for the reasons I outlined. Also, storing Gear Templates locally would be far more risky than sharing your API key, as all the key allows someone to do is see certain information about your account. Keep in mind that Gear Templates are effectively inventory space, so storing them locally could allow their contents to potentially be modified by the player without any real way for the game to tell the difference, and I don't think I need to explain why that would be a bad thing.
---
Similarly, if something happens to that computer than any items in those templates would be lost, which is just as problematic. There are all sorts of solutions with encryption and checks and such that ANet could use to mitigate these risks, but at the end of the day just storing everything remotely is both easier and safer, which is why they do that for every other part of a player's account (except game settings, which it makes sense to store locally due to different computers having different capabilities).
---
&gt; Who honestly expected them to be free?
---
morons
---
Well that‚Äôs one I haven‚Äôt checked but I could understand that. Don‚Äôt think they ever managed to get a sustainable nice ramp for wvw reward feedback loop. And too dependant on too many people to be of same mindset as you, eg for spvp you only need like 10 people to want to play, while wvw you need at least 50 people on each server.
---
For Largos bubbles, do stun breaks work?
---
Just don't use it on Guardians?
---
ArcDPS can no longer provide their better build template system.  I know it's not a directly deleted feature, but it is a popular tool denied to the community so Anet can sell a worse version.
---
People were bitching non-stop about the Ranger being able to dismount them  
---
WvW'ers have no idea what they actually want which is half the reason Anet doesn't bother to cater to them  
---
WvW'ers: We want to be able to get back to the fight quickly. Hoofing it across the map sucks.  
---
Anet: Okay, here's mounts with high movement speed.  
---
WvW'ers: What the fuck?! This isn't what we wanted.  
---
Many such cases...
---
Eh. The game isn't static. Plenty of good stuff to say about the latest episode. Lots of ways to make that interesting.
---
Okay, deleted my comment because I'm stupid. You meant ArcDPS's developer.
---
Yeah, I know about deltaconnect's deal, but that deal is years old and Anet may have changed their stance. They once didn't accept 3rd party addons and changed their stance on that. It might happen again. So far I'm open to Anet not enforcing their deal.
---
Is it a bird? Is it an airplane? No! It's Tentacle Tina!
---
As far as I know people wanted a way to store their gear.
---
&gt;That'd even be an improvement over arcdps since arcdps couldn't change gear, only traits.
---
This is patently wrong. Arc changes gear and that's the main functionality of it. 
---
Also, to use a quick example, two of my mesmer builds are power chrono and power chrono when my sub doesn't have spotter - stuff like that is hard to remember even if I could use one as a 'base'.
---
Another good example is I have a set with 1251 toughness (to be higher than firebrands when tanking) - I can't remember the exact pieces of gear I need to swap to Knight's to get that exact amount.
---
Even if I take a lot of 'base' builds:
---
- Power Chrono with Greatsword
---
- Power Chrono with Focus (different traits, precision, etc)
---
- Support Chrono
---
- Support Chrono (high tougness)
---
- Condi Support Chrono (for Largos/Cairn/etc)
---
- Condi Support Chrono (high toughness, for SH)
---
- Mirage
---
- W3 Towers
---
That's also avoiding a lot of the cases I do want weird traits and gear.
---
My honest opinion on this one is they missed the deadline on this Guild Wars 1 style template system and Deltaconnected find away to do it by himself so they can't just put the existing system as it is since it would damage their reputation, not that I would mind having ArcTemplate as it is but it's related to PR and Marketing side of things, so they are trying to do something new with and engine they don't really understand ( Remember they said inventory system is a nightmare during the stream ). Kudos to person who is working on this project since I know how terrible you feel when you work with something fragile and alien to you but that doesn't mean ArenaNet can expect us to accept inferior system and go a step further and try to milk us.
---
(Just to clarify when I say milking us , I'm talking about build templates part since they can easily store that info in the servers without needing much space but they want us to pay for it, gear templates however is something necessary as I explained above.)
---
IN REGARDS TO COMMISSIONS: Please see my twitter for the open post! It will be first come first serve probably this weekend or next week! Twitter.com/butterup5
---
majority of the casuals will still refuse to  use something proper for their current build and prefers their random useless build they made once the hid 80 the first time
---
Thanks for the reply and yeah it does seem a little silly to me too.
---
....probably shouldn't have decided that arcdps would never go away, when it was labeled as temporary from the start. It's only been here for like two years out of the game's lifespan of seven. What did you do before? 
---
The more I look at this, the more I can't take the howling seriously. You raided fine before arcbuilds. Just make a few equipment templates with your generic power/condi/support builds, and adjust infusions manually. Like you used to.
---
Gear slots saved on server is fine, but build (trait/skill selection) could be saved locally and cost 0 to have more for Anet. How do we know this? We have this now with arc. 
---
Since gear works as a ‚Äúbag‚Äù for inventory, that‚Äôs fine.
---
No that guy was an ass for the sake of being an ass and he could‚Äôve removed the tos breaking tech behind BDGM but insisted on keeping it in spite. 
---
And I gave him suggestions on how to handle gear checking and he refused .
---
"We ArE VeRy ImPOrtAnT YoU WIll ReGRet ThIS"
---
Just because you don't strive for excellence in your GW2 experience doesn't mean others don't.
---
And they are technically free the way people are talking about them you'd think Anet are locking the actual feature behind the gemstore.
---
Shoutout to the warrior for having both the best and worst skins of all elite spec weapons, respectively Silence of a Thousand Years and Wild Abandon
---
Oh wow, I completely missed that in the stream. Great then, the technology is there already. 
---
Thanks for pointing it out.
---
People wouldn't be complaining if they add a brand new feature and monetize it. A
---
People are complaining because Anet is disabling something we already have from arc templates, then making us pay for a shittier version of it.
---
It's DuckDuckGo, it's not always great.
---
What the fuck, really?  
---
Maybe they intended because they thought it would be hard to reach it without Skyscale? Otherwise that's just retarded
---
I see. How about Story missions and such? If I go for a Staff - Axe/Horn build will that be enough? Will I have enough story characters around to help out and keep alive?
---
just use the tomes as u feel like, they are used in guild upgrades and that's about it.
---
Unfortunately they do...
---
If we could just load our gear from our inventory with gear templates. We wouldn't be so upset. Who needs 4 more gear template storage when you have max bag slots?
---
It seems that it has a reliance on having to heal people to grant some boons to them. At the moment, warrior doesn't have a decent way to output those heals and therefore doesn't have a decent way to output the related boons. I suspect that anet is planning for a support elite spec down the road.
---
But for pvp.
---
Surely, these items could always be newly generated thanks to how pvp items worked, but considering even arc had these checks for items in inventory ...
---
Maybe you just spoke to people that enjoy the same things you do and therefore don't actually need the multiple templates? (Yes, I am blatantly assuming you don't raid or do any other kind of "hardcore" PvE content.)
---
Because the people I've spoken too don't like the implementation as well. My entire guild for example. Or several people in regular map chat.
---
Swapping traits/skills is a lot less work than gear.
---
I wouldn't mind if that's true either. This company needs that kind of smart more often, at least while the mood is so heated.
---
Players, choose one:
---
- Pay monthly sub and get everything in-game for free
---
- Pay once or get game for free, but everything in-game is monetized
---
Funnily enough the devs who do raid design have said they play out encounters using tabletop versions of it to see if the mechanics would be fun, I wonder if you could ask one of them directly for their actual homebrew rules to see if yours are close.
---
Homebrew what you will, just like with gw2 you will find trying to attrition your players with these feats very difficult, as gw2 has found in it's combat.
---
Hey man. Thanks for the templates and arcdps.  I appreciate them a lot.
---
oh god, you're serious... -.-
---
I'm kinda surprised they didn't add some kind of advantage to the official templates. Making them be considerably better would allow them to keep ArcDPS around without impacting sales.
---
Something like accountbound templates for the gear would have been great, since ArcDPS can't do that. Big mistake not to have it.
---
Where in the world did you dig up the part about being "burned out"?! I have never expressed anything of the sort, I log in every day and enjoy my time very much with the game. You are either confusing me with someone else or you are projecting something completely unwarrented onto me for no particular reason other than maybe to act like it strengthens your arguement.
---
On the topic of arc: ArenaNet essentially created an inferior product, monitized it, and then technically monopolized it (it's their game their rules, I get that). I've enjoyed the game to its fullest because of arc, and now I'm being asked to tone that back or "just buy more characters" because of an upper limit to the official template.
---
Me too , and we keep arc. And those of you who wish to give money to anet for nothing , just go tp and buy random useless shit there is right now.
---
Never said we couldn't go on, just that it would be exceptionally more inconvenient - but that would be *nuance* and I suspect a thing that is lower than a clown is incapable of understanding anything like that
---
You realize there are 3 systems in place each costing money? One of them no one would have issue with it's the other 2 that's the main problem. I'm reading multiple posts defending the system and completely missing the point.
---
Brb, buying some slots
---
It didn't break the TOS, gear checking is allowed in other regions, he can't control who downloads it.  ANET just has stupid policies that are anti-player, like they're doing to ARC now.
---
Dude wtf you on .. costs gems cause of database maintenance? Not sure if this is troll or not. The traffic generated by people messing around in one day is probably lower than the traffic generated in 1 teq fight.
---
i have curently  38k dps on berz in fractals with scholar runes. play meta,dont join shit comps and dont try reinvent the wheel. META comp is there for reason.
---
That's more on Anet's awful marketing.
---
Huh.. neat. Propably didn't know about it since many of my characters were pvp ready.
---
Dang, and you only tell me this now, when I have only one month left to use it? :')
---
After thinking over night what this build template can provide, it is actually opening many great possibilities how easy it is to swap builds. For example: Swapping from DPS daredevil to pylon deadeye. Or swapping from DPS holo to farmer engi. Or swapping from BS warrior to DPS warrior. Or swapping from weaver to tempest.
---
I see this QoL feature, there is no more room for human errors and builds are easily changed by hotkeys. Autoswap feature will get removed (automatically change build by gamemode), but hotkeys compensate that almost 100%.
---
Provide proof or you're just a liar
---
I probably would have been less upset by this whole situation if we got a raid wing twice the size every 3 months, instead of 3 bosses once in 10 months. Hardcore players get taxed the most, but don't get content in return. This is like the biggest issue here. Anet just once again showed us, that it does not care about the most dedicated part of the community.
---
Started out well with the wardrobe slots and took a nosedive into absurdity right after.
---
The lore and story were engaging. Cutscenes and voice acting are getting better and better; that scene in Bangar's office was on the level of quality of Joko's monologue. The underlying sinister themes in the story and peppered around the map, which makes it pretty fun to run around afterwards and go "omg how did I miss that?" Bangar is a nice change from an overwhelmingly powerful villain, to something more sinister and on our level, something we can definitely connect with. Plus, the political themes in this episode cannot be missed. Oh, and as always, Ascalon looks gorgeous.
---
Event design across the entire map is interesting and varied; Doomlore is the only one that is slightly disappointing as it's just another escort/kill/boss chain, but the other three all have unique mechanics and actively reward players working together (more than just playing near each other) without being overly punishing, dove-tailing nicely with the overlying theme of unity and celebration. Sound design in the metal concert is awesome. Bringing back the red/green/blue auras from Scarlet's invasion is always welcome, it's a great mechanic for PUG bosses. The JP is fair but not too easy, and suits the environment very well. 
---
The new weapon skins are really cool and interesting, and are not too expensive to acquire (plus you get one free from two weeks of dailies, so that's nice). The t-shirt and microphone skins in particular make for some awesome new looks. Getting a new emote as the meta reward is a great change, and I'm thrilled that they're open to expanding the emote system after all these years.
---
The Strike system is effectively giving us what we've been asking for for years: repeatable dungeons in the overworld, outside of fractals. They're awesome. Who cares if the first boss is too easy? This is a system that they'll be able to build off of and use to make content reusable going forward, and so it's probably the most important new feature in the patch.
---
I have seen a deadeye which can get on a mount midcombat
---
No he never mentioned anything about all classes on 1 character.
---
Maybe read the post.
---
This is more like the TP where everyone interfaces with a single database. That is why the dev in the livestream said doing more than 24 would be getting scary.
---
My girlfriend would love some of those pants.... what's wrong with a little merch?
---
&gt;Someone who likes to switch gears with builds and actually makes use of all game modes will feel strangled unless he spends a lot of money
---
Subjective and false.
---
No one taught me to play.... doesn't take a genius to figure shit out with trial and error. Pretty much like real life except you... can die in game.
---
I recommend avoiding Neverwinter Online as well, guess what, you only get 2 Loadouts (build+equipment template, but you still need the equipment in your inventory) and you need to pay 500zen/5$ to get one more.  
---
Preposterous isn't it?
---
Just too mich of them....

-caledon forest end of asuran lab jumping puzzle (that one was planned for the forgotten cerebro jumping puzzle, if breaking the map you can see 6 rooms the other side of the gate behind walls)
---
-Rata Sum: the one for polymock arena lead to one gate at polymock arena but at the arena there is a second non functionnal one.
---
-BL vaults lion's arch: that one is spotted by only breaking map and is very interesting:
---
In the last vault, you have a giant broken asuran gate interactable. It emits sparks when interacting, it turns on then after some seconds it shut itself down. The gate is hidden behind crates.

That's what I remember, have to recheck ls4 maps. You're welcome.

---
Well with this statement it seem like it's going to to be gone for good.
---
You're running a 5-year-old productivity-themed notebook processor with 2 cores and a 2.6 ghz clock speed. The game is poorly optimized, but your hardware is very low-end. Not many people get great FPS in this game, but your setup and your results are well below average.
---
Resetting my router helped!! Maybe you need to do it as well.
---
That was my plan, but my rev's inventory has too many stuffs in it for raids and fractals for me to play it in Open World. I don't want to fall back in Inventory Wars 2. Probably going to switch to main rev when build templates go live though.
---
So are you ignoring the gold sinks of copper fed slavage kits, shared inventory slots, character slots, bank tabs, material storage tabs, bag slots, commander tags, the griffon etc?
---
Im still working on getting those things, and now ill have another per-character gold sink to worry about
---
Also let's be careful not to forget that gold to gem conversions get worse the more people do it. Gem prices are gonna climb like crazy
---
hey look, more bitching
---
I was thinking about creating an entire new topic for a suggestion, but I thought it would be more modest trying to post it here and having some feedback.
---
So, problem number 1-  Now actually using shades feels like, at start, a negative gain on damage or healing, whatever is your role, since it takes the shade from you to use it at a distance.  
---
problem number 2- since you won't have much benefits on closer range if you place a far away shade, (which takes time to aim, cast and them use skills)....being at a melee range is actually a vantage now for using shades. Like the Scepter on Guardian, it is theoretically a ranged weapon/skill, but no one use it as such.
---
problem number 3- I think they tried nerfing Sand Savant doing that, which actually made it even more popular. I mean:  
---
No Sand Savant - you use one shade, but lose yours. You have to place two others, which have a greater cooldown, so you can have max benefits from it.
---
Sand Savant- one button. Bam. You got the 3 shades benefits of Sand Sage, and since it is a bigger area, you can somewhat place it between you and your enemy, using the whole diameter of the shade. Also, faster cooldown  
---
My suggestion: Make you have "unused sand shades" at your position.
---
Without sand savant - You place one, but still have yours in your place. But when you place all three, then you lose yours. Placing two will kinda be optimal for when you want to cover a greater area with the help of your movement. Make the number of targets 4 per shade (I mean, they can do that, right? It is not always 3, 5 or 10 targets, since Mace 5 in warrior have 6 targets). I just don't know how would Sand Sage deal with the numbers. Maybe have a base 75 bonus to conc/expertise, and you can stack two more for the 225 total.  
---
Sand Savant - stays as it is. Sand Savant is good enough as it is, it is almost literally the only average fix to how they dealt with the sand shades.
---
I don't think they ever did. That's why I think this option isn't going to happen.
---
It's a struggle, I did it before the nerf on a condi druid and it wasn't easy, but with the pet nerf it just feels like hard work. Condi trapper is an almost reasonable build still, but it's definitely lackluster.
---
Oh, that could be interesting. Even if not meta, it's still make me curious. Ty for suggestion!
---
I'll definitely give it a try tonight. Thanks for the tip!
---
I mean, they made that decision pretty much right out the gate with LWS1 and Fractals and it hasn't killed the game yet, so I doubt this will be thing that makes it spontaneously implode.
---
Holy shit, that's seriously egregious monetization right there. I understand they have to make money on the 2 years they developed the feature but ffs, I'd gladly pay 400 gems per upgrade if they were account wide. I won't get ANY if they are by character. I have 19 characters and that would be impossible to get more than 1-2 to max. HAVE THEM ACCOUNT BOUND!
---
No joke, all they do is quote reddit and getting payed.
---
I honestly wasn't being critical. I do key runs and even buy keys from time to time, both with gold conversion and real money. I just recalled that little aphorism :).
---
Yeah they are selling me a bag I can't put anything in since all my gear is legendary. The storage space is moot for me so why do I pay to be able to store legendary gear stat combinations?
---
You can only swap runes this way if they are legendary runes. For legendary armor with standard runes you still have to click a dozen times.
---
Isn't that the way you fall into the cave after the tree code?
---
Couldn't you just bypass the limitations of having so little free slots by leaving one slot open and pasting in your alt configs from a notepad or something?
---
honestly even that might not save anet from the shit storm.  6 equipment templates is incredibly limiting for the players with legendary armor.
---
from what i've heard anything "official" with anet has to go through so many channels its ridiculous
---
Except that the developer would likely get into some sort of legal trouble if they decided to add a monetary value to arcdps. 
---
It was an unofficial third-party program. Of course it's going to be free.
---
So I will be able to hold all the templates I could ever need in a folder on my PC?
---
Well, then. I may only have up to 24 online slots for builds, but harddisk space is cheap, so as long as I can import build templates into these 24 slots, there will be no problem for the vast majority of players. As text files are rather compact, you could store them on any given online storage, or keep a copy on you private e-mail account. The possibilities for local templates are vast enough for me to work around the slot limitation.
---
Sounds pretty up-to-date. We'll see if they change their mind. Fuck them if they don't.
---
Literally everything in the game is optional, so thats not really a valid point.
---
&gt; has to go through so many channels its ridiculous
---
This is where a lot of GW2's problems come from. There seems to be so much management on *everything* that anything worthwhile either takes ages to get approved or they corrupt it somehow.
---
Not in the context. This collection is not stopping you from completing this episode's meta achievements, therefore receiving a gold star in hero journal.
---
&gt; There is a possibility that the hardcore players would be better off without this feature at all, but they would have kept asking for it until the game sunsets.
---
Hardcore players required the templates the most. Switching legendary stats (will be easier with new update for legends) was the biggest imo. Changing each and every piece was VERY time consuming. Not to mention difficult to remember ‚Äúwhere the arms X stat and the shoulders Y, or the other way around??‚Äù.
---
Not to mention, a large complaint from those hardcore players is that Trait/Skill templates, which wouldn‚Äôt require much storage space on servers, doesn‚Äôt just load from local. Currently, Arc saves a local file for the trait build, and we know gw1 did the same. Theoretically, it wouldn‚Äôt be much to do the same client side. Have a reader for local files, and then be able to have unlimited trait builds.
---
Gear, since it‚Äôs also a storage now, doesn‚Äôt seem minded to be paid. However, limiting it is an unusual thing. The only rational thought would be to push people towards buying more character slots to get around the limit, which reads as ‚Äúgreed‚Äù, since it‚Äôs an additional $10 before even being *able* to buy more. Especially since we can reasonably suggest they‚Äôd increase the limit later on (either with better servers in the future, or expacs releasing a third elite spec, which would ‚Äúrequire‚Äù extra slots). Which would be to metaphorically spit in the face of those who *do* buy extra char slots - level them, gear them, grind for hero points for the specs, buy extra tabs for templates - just for them to increase the amount in the future.
---
Not to mention, the limitations and devaluation of those who spent time and in game wealth (and irl, looking at you credit card warriors!) to craft.
---
To call Anet ‚Äúgreedy goblins‚Äù, isn‚Äôt too far from the truth. Even when you look at their Aug 30th announcement ‚Äúwe‚Äôre bringing these updates out free and without sub fees‚Äù. Which really should be ‚Äúfree*‚Äù, *to start.
---
It was just a suggestion.  
---
Sure I can use a .txt file and keep all the templates with names here, but a web site where you can see the skills/traits and just click on the code link and have it directly copied for you is much better.
---
Hard for me to say for sure, but...
---
it probably depends on the diversity of gear in each game and what's historically been available. I haven't played NWO, so I don't know how it compares to GW2.
---
In GW2, there are a wide variety of different gear stats, and thus there is a wide variety of different roles and, thus, gear sets, that are frequently used for any given profession. If NWO doesn't have as wide a variety of gear types or roles, that would help explain this.
---
And in GW2, there's been a different (it seems many would argue better) source of templates that is now being replaced; I feel like if that had never existed- if we were going from no templates at all to the built-in solution- there would be less outrage. If NWO has had the same "loadout" setup since launch, or at least never had an alternative replaced, that would also explain why GW2 has more outrage over this than NWO.
---
I think another source of the GW2 outrage could be that we don't have a price for extra templates yet. People are estimating with what they think ANet might charge, but in the end, we don't know. It could be 50 gems for a new tab; it could be 400. We don't know. (someone correct me if there's an official source out actually showing prices)
---
I have some ideas as covers. Ty appreciated
---
And I acknowledged that the game is poorly optimized. I'm just saying that his abysmal performance is not typical and well below average, due to running the game on a productivity notebook designed for word processing and spreadsheets.
---
That's what I understood. Mind you, it's interpretation based on their wording. I COULD be wrong. Which in that case, sorry.
---
I don't get it. This feature ranges from a net 0 (assuming you have no need for extra inventory that can only be filled with equipment) to a godsend.   
---
Also, while I admit that I could be wrong here, I get the feeling that you have 3 or 4 armor sets, and occasionally, swap out 2 -4 pieces of equipment for min max purposes. And IF that is the case, you have reduced the amount of fluffing about in your inventory SIGNIFICANTLY by buying two armor sets.   
---
Now all that being said, if they were pulling support for addons (like making it bannable to use them) that would be messed up. Otherwise, I don't see anything but positives for this being implemented.
---
They said they wouldve loved for that, but something about an item being on one character,  isn't accessible by another character currently
---
It's so bright out here with all the White Knights around.
---
Well, there's always [Iron's tailpipe bandana](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Iron%27s_Tailpipe_Bandana) which is extremely low effort, but rare due to its location.
---
&gt; Because Anet is dipping their toe into borderline (if that) p2w territory
---
I really get annoyed seeing this being thrown around. Build Templates are not a P2W feature. By your logic anyone who is using Arc templates is cheating. Build Templates are a insane QoL feature. You can still change your gear manually if you choose so. I know you guys are upset by come on, you're making fools out of yourselves saying its P2W.
---
I'm not really sure what counts as "hardcore" or "semi-hardcore", it's a bit of a vague term and all, but I basically just use my thief for everything with about 4 templates or so in arc currently for my usual raiding business.
---
Also, calling the price "60 USD" is silly, because you know that me and all those other "hardcore" players are just going to convert gold to gems for it and don't spend a single euro or dollar on it, anyways.
---
They are getting paid through micro transactions in the in-game store, you wet noodle. They don't need to get paid through the build templates transactions themselves.
---
I doubt the same people work on build templates and game performance though.
---
Per character. But if you buy to increase the slots (to a max of 6) it‚Äôs assumed you have the extra only on THAT character.
---
I've always asked for storage. In fact this is the way I've always imagine build templates would work.
---
&gt; it would damage their reputation
---
is this a fk joke?
---
the **** they want to pull of now, asking for premium for an heavily inferior version, did already more dmg, then anything coping an existing third party tool would have done
---
I mean, if you have 100% Legendary gear you just kinda *don't*, and if not you pay to store all the non-Legendary stuff as well as swap it all around instantly, or not if you don't care that much. They've already added functionality for changing all your Legendary stuff at once, so unless you're running very specific mixed stats just, well, *not bothering* with the whole system is actually a realistic option for you.
---
After every new GW2 announcement nowadays, I feel more and more demotivated from even visiting this subreddit. It's as if those vocal people lost the last bits of common sense and perspective and developed the ultimate entitlement over here - and with no one to control them.
---
I - honestly - just can't wait when all those who are so mad about a game in which they are not the target audience finally just leave for good and play that other *perfectly real* unmonetized MMO with an insignificant subscription fee that releases more content that they can ever play which is tailored precisely for those hardcore players which definitely account for the absolute majority of paying gamers in the industry.
---
Then we will, hopefully, have some sanity here again.
---
warhorn still sucks
---
You guys ever stop to wonder what your life would be like if you channeled this much energy into things you enjoyed?
---
All that's needed is to keep ArcDPS around. All Anet has to do is to not nuke it. Problem solved, everyone's happy.
---
I think you missunderstood what Equipment Template was there to be, and a lot have missunderstood it. It's not there to store a build for each encounters in the games and every possible build you might be using.
---
It's there to give you the possibility to change all your gear for a complete different setup. Changing only runes/sigils, increasing/lowering toughness or precision isn't why Equipment Template was created. You could easilly change it manually in nearly no time loss.
---
This can significant be lower if you only keep store some builds, do runes swap manually and all stats gear swap (with the new check box it's really quick to change all Legendary like Harrier to Minstrel in a few click):
---
- Berzerker Gear
---
- Viper Gear
---
- Diviner Mix Gear (if you really use it that often)
---
- Healer Gear
---
- WvW Build
---
In conclusion, people need to understand that the Equipment Template isnt there for small changes like runes, sigils or few trinkets just like Arcdps Template give the possibility. I didnt say that Anet might not implemented something for those small changes but it's not Equipment Template that will achieve that. Even more with the Legendary Armor, Weapons, Trinket, Sigils and Runes millions combos possibles you might wanna use.
---
I mean that is another possible solution, I just don‚Äôt see that happening. Like ever. This stuff could at least happen. Maybe?
---
It's a personal decision based off of the coming reality expressed as a short tweet. It wasn't meant to make a point.
---
Also, thanks!
---
doesnt matter to me. i have enough characters BECAUSE of the limited bag slots that equipment isnt going to matter. the issue: actual builds that i dont want to have to go look up whenever i want to change.
---
Depends, who are you fighting? In NA at least, it feels like it happens most when facing a couple of servers.
---
You‚Äôre making the assumption that delta actually wants to keep updating his system, but he might very well be glad this is finally coming out and he has this less to work on. And he would have to rework his system completely to match the new gear functions, which would probably be a lot of work. 
---
Not to mention it would make zero sense for them to allow a 3rd party tool to cover a game functionality
---
Then don't buy it, so what?
---
gotta spend money to make money
---
Sorry if I caused confusion, but I don't even use ArcDPS (as mentioned due to lack of interest in add-ons). I was referring to those that do. I personally use three characters and run one build for their intended purpose.
---
Spent too long developing them with some hard design choices and not understanding player base sufficiently ...gets us to the current situation .... players with pitchforks.
---
If this was a business customers would be leaving and walking out to the competition down the road.
---
I was broken up with the Dragonsblood weapons. Move over it. I live better every release now.
---
at this point i wish they at least allowed the legendary gear swapping. keep anets build+equipment slots while allowing arc to save different legendary configurations. this allows anet to still monetize the extra slots but allows legendaries to keep their convenience.
---
Eh, it's details. I actually don't really care what they monetize, it's a given that I'll end up spending money on it. If I spend it on the purple box or the yellow one doesn't matter to me. So, if it's about me, yeah, sure. Whatever. Monetize Gear Templates. Makes sense, seperating the inventory part from the template part.
---
What *does* matter to me is not losing years worth of QoL. I'll be genuinely pissed off if I actually lose all my templates. And for that, they'll have to keep ArcDPS around. Or, you know, give us like 500 slots or something for free. I think keeping ArcDPS is the better choice for them, monetary-wise. Far, FAR less people using that.
---
But isn't it making it public, with a meme, kinda making a point though? I mean, if you didn't want it to make a point you could just up and quit and be like, hey guys, I'm done playing the game. Ionno, that's just me though.

---
Possible problem: unless literally everything in a template is Legendary (which is guaranteed at the moment) you would still need to track non-Legendary stuff in the "Legendary Templates," effectively giving anyone with a single Legendary Rune or Sigil unlimited templates on at least one character. Also, if my understanding of the systems at play here is correct the problem is less about the raw volume of data and more about the number of entries in the database. A larger database takes longer to do anything with, and letting players put as much stuff in as they want is a great way to make it get very big, very quickly.
---
Use `!gw2`.
---
&gt; they want to pay for expacs and you see where that got us.
---
no more expacs?
---
I'm literally shaking right now
---
...wait, what? I can't safe my legendary gear in different slots with different stats?
---
It's there to give you the possibility to change all your gear for a complete different setup. Changing only runes/sigils, increasing/lowering toughness or precision isn't why Equipment Template was created. I have Characters with litteraly 6 armors+trinkets+weapons ascended set and I think thats for those situations that the equipment template was created.
---
People need to understand that the Equipment Template isnt there for small changes like runes, sigils or few trinkets just like Arcdps Template give the possibility. I didnt say that Anet might not implemented something for those small changes but it's not Equipment Template that will achieve that. Even more with the Legendary Armor, Weapons, Trinket, Sigils and Runes millions combos possibles you might wanna use.
---
But builds are heavily impacted by gear... you cant be so naive to think that people would be happy with just trait saving
---
GW2 is limited to one-core so single core performance is what matters most for it. His dual core @2.6-3.1GHz processor is really single core as far as GW2 is concerned, making OP's extremely mediocre CPU much more of an issue.
---
Cry me a river. You didn't have templates thus far,  I'm happy I get 3 free. If you want the game to survive and keep putting out more FREE content with a free to play model, and don't want jt to be play to win, embrace monetization
---
Well, yeah. If delta is sick of templates, that's his decision and the entire discussion is moot. I'd accept that and move on without *any* further fuss. Like that. *snaps fingers*
---
Depends: are u asura?
---
Asura don't need chairs :)
---
My take on this is simple - they tried something new, complicated where players wanted something like the GW1 system where skills.weapons,trinkets,attributes,sigils,infusions could all be saved to a chat code and all swapped out/over.
---
The funny thing is arcdps has managed this - if you look at the files it saves locally it stores all this information.
---
There is absolutely no real need for it to be server side.  I believe they tried something it hasn‚Äôt worked their is a significant proportion of the player base that is unhappy with what is being shown/proposed - which should at this point mean going back to the drawing board.
---
What would be the point of that, the money you would make of it would be shit
---
Yeah the more I think about it you may be right. However the thought of this seething cess pool of a subreddit actually pulling together with one voice is something that makes me laugh pretty hard. I‚Äôm convinced there are people in here who don‚Äôt play the game anymore who simply stick around to stir up drama. 
---
That being said, I would be be overjoyed if they kept ArcDPS Templates and would probably crap my pants.
---
He said character. You said class. My comment to you covered both complaints.
---
But how does the addition of an official build template system cripple your main fun? It's not like this replaces the "existing" system of doing it manually. You could just go on like you, presumably, have before and literally nothing would change for you.
---
You could report him to customer support, I guess.
---
Don't get your hopes up, though. That's part of the risk you run when mailing stuff to people, especially those who you might have just met.
---
Unless you know what you're doing, are working with a good friend or trusted middle man, I really recommend just doing things the old fashioned way to avoid getting scammed.
---
so you mean guild wars 1?
---
Uhh I don‚Äôt use arcdps and I still agree with the stance that build templates shouldn‚Äôt be monetized and if they are it should be more expansive(higher cap) and either be an expansion feature or a 1 time payment. People complaining about lame monetization don‚Äôt make them insane
---
Show me one argument of someone saying "1 build template is enough for most of us"
---
It's just the same people who want to be part of the outrage machine who get mad about every tiny thing.
---
if you don't value in it, why would you pay?
---
&gt;questionable
---
Ah yes, charging for goods and services, truly we live in a dystopia
---
Well, you should've done your research i.e. look at r/GW2Exchange instead of just asking random people. Yeah you'll still technically be asking randoms but *randoms with reputation.* But you're shit out of luck for the most part.
---
For one or two classes? Yeah, 24 is probably sufficient. For 9 classes? Absolutely not.
---
If you want to troll at least try to make sense.
---
Can we trade build slot for additional inventory slot? 6 x20 X character wow. Ok for me . Whenever you want
---
That **is** their argument. If it's enough/fine for me it's enough for everyone else. And that's worse than the already laughable "but they need to make money somehow" argument
---
mesmer sword/ staff makes it keep up, I've kept up with warclaws on dd ele but cant keep it going
---
you can but that means you have to use a new slot for the every change. changing precision to make up for no spotter--&gt;spend an extra slot.
---
jesus Christ.. well no. not even that guy could help you..
---
Ppl sad about arcdps templates going away I guess
---
read his response to me. it gets even "better"
---
I can't say I'm impressed with those things either. Build Templates differ from these things, however, in that there was already a community provided solution to a problem that Anet spent years not addressing. It underscores how little work is really involved with making build templates.
---
Yeah, just like ArcDPS. I get that. One of the reasons why nuking the Arc templates is fucking bullshit.

its called arenanet. a company which once cared for their community just a tiny bit more, was able to fit in build templates, easy and hardmodes, content for all kinds of people, be it casual or hardcore into one giant community with so many different aspects and great fansites. not to speak of the constant updates over quite a few years.   
---
...didn't age well tho when it came to gw2 in the end. so why should i support any of the games from the same company?
---
The long dev time is because they didn't commit to making them. Rather they had just a few devs dig around in the code to figure out what it would take design wise and they didn't start full development until the middle of 2019.
---
I agree that they didn't understand what we wanted, but we also don't understand the way the game is programmed. Maybe there is some limitation we don't know about. They kept acting scared to touch any code that interfaces with the inventory on the livestream.
---
I had so much faith in Anet, but now I just feel betrayed. This is like when Anakin betrayed Obi-Wan, except worse.
---
Because hyperbole is the best way to make a point
---
Just the amount of code to print half of a 6x6 square with asterisk is way more than you would think as a non-coder(?). I lost it at the point of arrays and calling things.

It's Vulkan with a 'k', but yes I 100% agree with you. Vulkan has all the functionality of dx9, anyway, so it's really just swapping out graphics API calls to port it over, hence the ability of dx912pxy to work.
---
Yep, they did.
---
Ofcourse we will buy them. What do you expect? Micromanaging Legendary Gear is a nightmare, especially if half the party needs to do it. If your whole Raidwing takes 30 minutes and you add another 2 minutes for every boss, you suddenly took 38 minutes. 8 mintues of standing around for each half an hour. If you raid 2h twice a week, those waiting periods grow old very quickly.
---
This whole "lets sell them Templates" after all this time is like giving someone electricity free for a year and suddenly we have to pay a full game price for half the voltage.
---
They know that. Anet isnt dumb. No one would have cared if the feature was better than what we had already.
---
&gt; others at least try so find solutions or explain which part they do not like exactly.
---
lol, no they dont. ppl who dont like the template news make threads all the time and they get upvoted and they dont get told to search first, because it fuels the current hate..... its always the same on this sub.
---
and you can take your smartass comment and shove it

Pretty much every MMO on the market right now has bigger content releases than GW2 for a long while now. 1 Episode every 4-5 months with 2-4 hours of content and shitty story is embarrassing, but at least there are shop updates every 2 weeks to milk money. Look at WoW, a Patch every 3-4 months with content for weeks, same for FFXIV, ESO constantly releasing new DLCs with tons of content. In all of these MMO's you will usually end up spending less money than you would in GW2 too.
---
There is a reason why a large amount of the MMO Community is staying as far away as they can from GW2. Pandering to hypercasuals that play the game once a week isn't going to keep this game alive forever. Actually this might already be the last chance GW2 will have, before it will follow in the footsteps of Wildstar, which did the exact opposite by only focusing on super hardcore players and eventually getting shut down by NCSoft. Why? Look at the layoffs.
---
Most of the vocal people that complain here, actually care about the game and want GW2 to sucessed, but hate the way Anet is wasting the potential it has. The casual fanboys keep defend everything Anet does and without them realizing it, they will eventually end up killing the game.
---
Hmm I wonder what are the missing notes. Updating a banner shouldn't require ~40+ files and 97MB.
---
Eeerr...the wardrobe system IS monetized...they gift a lot of charges, but they can be bought with gemstore...and the overall system makes people more willing to spend gems by buying gemstore skins. Same for the gathering wardrobe
---
And while the collection system isn't monetized directly, a lot of the rare collections etc are generally revolving around some rare item drop which cost a lot...and i've seen people gold converting to buy some of those because they couldn't be bothered, but wanted the achievement, lol...
---
Yeah, but they gotta test the port unless they want a select number of fans to test for free, which I would totally do for this game.
---
Just request a refund. They honored my request and were very understanding.
---
No need to have another post about this.

Yeah, that one actually looked decent but, well it's still underwhelming. I am pretty convinced that without reworking minions it's still well, bad. Plan to test poison builds tomorrow, but I don't really have high hopes.
---
[Well, this sums up my reaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_hJthMgtM)
---
That sentence doesn't make any sense. If you want to use equipment on the same character why do you need to transfer the gear to a different character?
---
I do however think that account bound gear should be treated like an account wide bank, and different characters should be able to equip gear that is technically on another character. Based on the way they designed it, I'm guessing thats not in the cards though.
---
Guild Wars 2's engine is a heavily modified (overloaded) version of GW1's.
---
Guild Wars 1 released 14 years ago
---
No berserker build has used tactics for a LONG time. Discipline is just sooo much better.
---
For years there has been a mod that does the same thing, but better, for free. Anet is discontinuing that mod to sell a worse version of it for cash. The new version also reduces the value of legendary gear, while the marketing stream specifically mentioned 'our most dedicated players' or some such.
---
TL;DR, these are a paid-for, but worse, version of a tool that has been available for free for a long time.
---
I honestly don't care at this point. They took so long to do this, I already invested in character slots to avoid having to change builds/gear. 
---
At this point though, if I were them (which I am not)... I would have presented this as a gift to the community with many more slots and not tried to use this particular feature as a revenue source since it has become a very touchy subject for a lot of the community. 
---
Maybe they would have lost some revenue as a result, but the goodwill would have brought back in the end.
---
Absolutely
---
How...?
---
Is that stock or OC'd? Quite hard to believe its possible to get constant 60 fps on a stock 8700k with everything maxed @1440p
---
So you mean to tell me that in a story driven RPG (MMO or otherwise) the vast majority of players do not do anymore of the personal story beyond the very beginning? Dude, that's bull and you know it.
---
Already did but you see.. I don't really want a gem refund. I want a kick ass charr version of the iron throne. I'd rather they admit it and fix it than quietly change the image and give refunds to those who think to ask for them and pocket the money from those who weren't.
---
Players: This can't be right. The chair doesn't match the advertisment at all.
---
Anet: Oh, I'm sorry. I will fix it immediately.
---
Player: Thank goodness :)
---
Anet: *changes the advertisment to match the chair*
---
Player: ...
---
I asked for a refund and I got it.
---
Next time you have to make sure the guy has good reputation(see the gw2 exchange blacklist). If you have evidence customer support should be able to get the guy banned. Not sure about  getting your item back though.
---
Slightly OC'd. I wasn't one of the lucky ones that could get 5GHz stable.
---
Didn't get this until recently with d912pxy
---
So keep using your old method then, instead of the new oh-so limiting build templates? I really don't see the big game-quitting-worthy problem here.
---
Also, these skins were designed by members of the community!
---
Let me go get my pedant-o-meter, hang on a minute.
---
This is super useful! Much easier to pick up trails when it goes into an area you want to skip. Also easier to see where they start from if you didn't go to the correct waypoint.
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Laughs in Monster Hunter World. Even saves your transmog and dyes too &lt;3

Maybe I expressed myself wrong, I meant this as a single solution, i.e. implement all 3 items %)
---
Oh yeah for fractals you have to go full glass cannon , dw though the support core in GW2 is stronger than ever so you won't die as much as you think .
---
Haven't played ele in pvp ever , so there is that .
---
Oh I see. I just misunderstood. That is a pretty massive difference from their current iteration.
---
I am pretty sure whoever was supposed to make the market art was given the chair model and assumed it was bigger.
---
Not the first time seeing something like that happen.
---
What the point of changing set when you can faceroll everything on zerk/viper ? At best you're gonna switch from Druid/Chrono to DPS for raid but I can't think about anything else.
---
Yeah but like, have you ever tried just enjoying what you have and not bitching about what you don‚Äôt have or what you have to pay for, for like five minutes? It‚Äôs a pretty fun way to live.
---
Well maybe because the entire post is just complaining? Typically you don't complain if you're having a good time.
---
Most of the gem store chairs only cost ~150 gold, though...
---
No,they fixed it.
---
I like thief videos in general gj .
---
I don't think that the exact numbers he gave as an example are important in his point ...
---
Well at least there is that... &gt;\_&gt; (I'm still steaming x\_x)
---
The ARC addon is not simple to use or intuitive, it's not for everyone. The anet implementation would be simpler though severely limited. Not siding with them on this but I predict that months after the feature release Anet will just come out with a statement that "98++% of our active users love the new build templates feature"  and declare it a massive success. This whole thing will be swept under the rug and you will still be angry.
---
Well, fair enough, but I assure you the bench of the final judge is large enough for any charr.
---
INOY UP.
---
&gt; utely does not use only a single core. Just take the 30 seconds to check for yourself with task manager if you don't believe me!
---
I'm not retarded, I assure you. Single core performance will far outweigh anything else with GW2, and I spent a year figuring that out for myself with various hardware configs, OSes, etc. (was surprised that running it in Wine wasn't as big of a performance decrease as I thought it would be). Granted, this was about a year and a half ago so maybe they changed something but Anet doing meaningful performance improvements without fixing a bug or crash they introduced is just a hilarious thought.
---
For some anecdotal evidence, a Xeon x5660 in my spare rig running a Radeon HD 6970 and 8GB generic value RAM has maybe 15% less fps than my main gaming rig (6700K w 980Ti normalized to 8GB RAM for testing). The game is single core performance bound to this day.
---
Trust me, I know. A big part of my life is a lot of fun. But it's not always sunshine and roses. Life sometimes makes things hard for you but at that point you have to pull up your pants and just keep going. This is such a thing.
---

I was honestly a lot happier before joining this sub, just playing the game and having fun.
---
I originally joined to sub to keep up to date on GW2 current events, but instead all I got was a bunch of upset nerds, complaining about shit that doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
The funny thing is, their aim is to point out things they think are a problem with the game, but all they‚Äôve succeeded at doing is pushing me away from the sub. I‚Äôm almost at a point where I might just call it and unsub from this.
---
When you actually log in, the in game community is not only thriving, but generally happy to be online and playing. The people on this sub try to make it seem like the game is dying and that honestly couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth.
---
Yes it was /u/linseymurdock
---
you can, you provide a better service
---
Cool, thanks, I haven't used that wiki much, so I wouldn't think to check it.
---
Crazy that I'm getting downvotes for just... not knowing features of a game I played briefly a few years ago...?
---
I maxed out bag slots on all of my 10 characters (except the engi, which I did not enjoy playing, but even she got two), just to store all these piles of ascended garbage, which I swap around all the time (lost count at 25 ascended sets). And now they bundle gear templates with armory and charge for that. (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
---
equipment templates were only available for pvp only characters because it was safe to modify their equipment willy nilly because it couldnt be introduced to the economy at all. But you knew that before responding to me, right?
---
right?
---
They are currently advertising for developers with knowledge of console development and Unreal engine. Given the age of GW2, it' s likely they have started work on a cross platform successor but any release will be several years away.
---
SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING. updated jpg
---
There's a small scaling issue in this build when things are war away on the world map, I have a fix but will wait for other feedback before I put out a hotfix release.
---
Limited? So i can‚Äôt do the old manual stat selection? That sucks, i thought that was an additional feature. Did they say the slots were account bound?
---
Not nerfed balanced
---
Cuuute
---
I. Fucking. Love. You.
---
It's huge!
---
I feel like there's far simpler explanations: 
---
1. They could monetize it.
---
2. Noone at Anet now knows how to properly work with the GW2 engine, and they just kind of have to ducttape new things on. Cynical me reckons they don't actually have a lot of programmers left and most of the (diminished) team is artists and writers.
---
Pugs will be pugs man , play the class you enjoy and don't worry about it seriously .
---
I'd take a necro main over a fotm weaver reroller any day of the week .
---
They actually have software engineers that work a lot on optimization and engine work.
---
"That, soldier, is the quote."
---
Well, all I can say is I'm happy I was already in the process of gearing a healbrand‚Ä¶
---
Could have probably done it for free, if they offered him official support.
---
I'm so glad I quit maining this game for FFXIV.  Anet are a bunch of greedy ass clowns LUL
---
Shrug.. I'll wait and see how they actually work before getting upset about anything.
---
The ignorance in this post is astonishing.
---
Do a -repair of the client, use the -forwardrender launch argument. Enjoy way higher FPS all across the board. There is no way your system should have such a shitty performance so either you have no idea what you're doing or there is something you're not telling us.
---
It's an exaggeration. It's not only using one CPU core 24-7 but dx9 dos not support multithreading very well, because doing so can cause significant performance degrade. So for the most part the bulk of rendering is done on the main thread, and pretty much the only thing that matters for performance on GW2 is single core performance. That's why overclocking makes a humongous difference for this game.
---
So why don't  they just use the GW1 system with all the extra paid bollocks as, well, extras. Noone asked for all this nonsense, most of us would have been perfectly content with a simple system like in GW1. It was extremely functional. It worked extremely fine.
---
Look where druid is now though  :/ the way i see it anything that isn't the absolute uber duber top dps flavor of the month thingy right now tends to get the hate even if it does a decent job in an average run (i would even dare say this happens across all game modes on my own experience and other roles besides dps).  But i see the point being made about necros,  having suffered the same as ranger.
---
Feel bad for you there are some rotten people in this world
---
I get what you're saying, it doesn't fix the bots, afkers, and win trading issues that have been way too easy to exploit in this game. Those things are also toxic and blocking/reporting doesn't fix the issue since those players can always come back. Even "top level" players who are caught only get temporary suspensions and a slap on the wrist from anet, making the situation even worse because even more people are doing it now that they've learned anet will just roll over and take it and not crack down.
---
I go by the notion that anet should worry less about balance and fix the key issues that are making people quit this gamemode. There have already been suggestions tossed around for implementing a detection in the spawn in pvp that will remove people who afk or bots that break in the spawn and never leave. In addition anet needs to start rewarding success and not participation in ranked pvp. There's too much incentive for people to afk and that is another reason the gamemode is becoming infested by toxic players.
---
They're not allowing people to keep the chair. I was confirmed by a dev already that once an item is added into the account it can't actually be removed.
---
This was brought upon one day when I bought a skin and I wasn't happy with it. I told them to remove the skin so I could just purchase something else instead. They refunded me the cost in full and told me that the skin could not be removed at that point.
---
With Arc's build templates, your legendary armor can be used in infinite number of different stat and runes combinations. With Anet's build templates, you're capped at maximum of 6, after you pay from the initial cap of 2.
---
they said they'll release expansion worthy content so there's hope for guild halls yet :) 
---
(haha jk)
---
Not just that. But because Anet decided to monetize a new system with extra bollocks noone really asked for, when the functionality we wanted already existed in GW1 (which uses the same engine, don't forget), and has already been functional in a mod for a good time. Now, \*seven years\* into the game, they try to make people shell out for it, whilst also dropkicking that mod. Personally i'm upset Anet is trying to weasel money out of players when it's entirely on them for missing a realistic deadline on templates by \*several years\*.
