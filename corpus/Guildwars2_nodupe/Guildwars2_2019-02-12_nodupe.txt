Hey yes I saw a player with the Greatsword "twilight" in Ascalon near the black citadel and the effects were pretty f_ing cool lol 
---
Following that logic we should be able to also craft exquisite serpentite jewels.
---
what a dumb fucking post
---
The distinction is they come in a setting already, less that it's a expac stat. 
---
:)
---
Just keep your inventory open and dragged to the side.
---
you are right, having to press dodge once in a while is far more taxing than getting 1shot by some random trash mob because you were facing the wrong way
---

---
how can you say fire is easy to avoid but then on the next sentence you say birds waste dodges? does fire not waste dodges too? i know you can block or reflect but most of the time you do have to dodge those too..plus if the fight has adds good luck avoiding all of the procs
---
slippery is slightly different physics?? if you use any form of movement ability you fly off the map..if you get knocked back somehow you get thrown halfway across the map
---
do you genuinely believe what you say or are you just trying to make a case because you don't like birds? i don't like them either, i don't like any instability honestly but they are a joke compared to everything else
---
I feel like this is a no brain since pretty much every other MMORPG has skill bars that you can put your inventory consumables on.
---
Too cool! I really hope you decide to include regular dailies. It's be great to wake up in the morning and ask Alexa what the dailies are, and know if I have time to do them before leaving for work. :)
---
i mean, im not talking about wiping. even a good ele will only get 15k DPS if it doesn't have constant quickness / alacrity uptime. quickbrand can get 15k DPS with no support at all, and upkeep 100% quickness on allies, so for pugs I'd rather take fb. it's just incredibly frustrating to play ele and be the #2 or #3 DPS compared to a dragonhunter or soulbeast because there isnt proper support for my ele to shine, whereas in statics or well formed groups my ele excels 
---
you're correct that these comments are encouraging people to play different classes rather than find better teammates, which is bad, but it's really hard to have a static if you're only on sporadically, which is the kind of player fractals are tailored towards

Archeage is awesome, I love the trading packs and the moving carriages from town to town.

The mount is nothing special imo, besides carrying passengers. The mount can boost but players on their own can already do that without it.

yeah, you did say issue and not bug, my mistake üôè

Mobile games too stronk.

I recently got transferred to the 2nd shift at my job working from 4pm to 3am, so usually when i play on the NA server lfg feels pretty dead, so im considering on transfering to the EU server hoping for more action. I am just wondering, will it be very laggy to play on Eu Server when i am in Canada? and will i be by with knowing only english?
---
I kinda want the option to hide chest armor. Or at least an invisible chest armor set. I know this has been asked for many times before though. I'd also like the much-in-demand (last time I checked) build templates. I think that's all for me. Even without these, I'm actually pretty happy with the game.
---
Do you know when the next GW2 sale might be? I've seen mention of a wiki that shows when sales might be, but can't find it again. Thank you!
---
i just fear with dps meter that ppl start to care to much about dps and not the task. Ive seen that a lot in raids. But i do like 2 be able 2 see how i do and where i can do better :D 
---
You are right. There was no LW episode in 4Q 18. If an episode would generate such more money the Arenanent should avoid larger gaps. At least they announced to aim for a two munths cadence in terms of season 5.
---
incredibly smooth. thank you for your work on this, anet needs to give you some props for this!
---
Not mean to be rude, but you also haven't bothered on searching for this before creating a new post, your request has been asked years ago, and also denied for whatever reason.
---
Ah like u can with shoulders and helm?   
---
if anything i want more slim armor xD :D i miss better heavy legs also, for females 
---
This is just a bad post. 
---
I mean more people use mounts than run Fractals. The mount comment is more or less of universal interest. Effort in a post isn't more important than a post that speaks to people.
---
Also, praising mounts isn't blind. There's this tendency to say that praise is blind, when that's not always true. Sometimes, as in the case of mounts, praise is deserving...thus not blind. To discredit people by saying their opinions is blind doesn't make you a hero. 
---
Blind praise post that are wrong often get downvoted. People who put work into a post that doesn't interest a lot of people sometimes get downvoted too. 
---
I'd say this isn't a competition, but I sort of feel like you're a competitive person and wouldn't listen. lol
---
I forgot there wasn't an episode in q4. That's pretty devastating, but reassuring that the drop was probably just from that. I was worried the generally better received ep4 wasn't enough to generate income for the quarter, but it seems it was actually ok in q3.
---
*Woah!* It's your **2nd Cakeday** Zerumiel! ^(hug)

Funerary legs and chest, Foefire Wraps, Wild Magic backpiece, nevermore and dunno the headpiece.

I'm glad someone posted this reply, or I would have
---
very cool!
---
Aurene's death had less impact on me than Blish. I knew Blish wasn't coming back, whereas with Aurene it was a frustrating death. Frustrating because Kralk's defeat will be delayed perhaps to next season. We all know Anet will write themselves into a corner if they don't bring her back, so she will return. Would be one hell of an ep if next ep, Aurene is resurrected AND kralk is defeated. Won't happen though since that's too much development for one ep. Expect Kralk to go down in late 2019/early 2020 in season 5.
---
I gave the same level of politeness in my reply as the reply from you that I was replying to. If you want me to be more polite then maybe you should have lead by example with lots of flowers and gifts.
---
The thing is that there really wasn't there a good chance for dropping the episode. It would've been squished between 2 major festivals, and also support on December would've been provided for 2 releases approaching the holidays. They stated the episode quality wasn't optimal ( in fact I have to say that despite some bugs, Ep5 release was smoother that usual ) and I do believe it just wasn't ready to be shipped.
---
Add to that the really controversial content ( spoilerfree resume: something major happened in the story that made the playerbase very conflictual about it ) and you can see why they just couldn't handle the release in early December.
---
We will see if the cadence will be more regular in Season 5, but I honestly think they'll stick to 3 month releases. Not a bad thing per se, but surely not a good selling point for at least a year.
---
This is a graph of NCsoft's quarterly earning for GW2 since 2015 https://imgur.com/a/dPtWRIo. We're nearing end of Season 3 profits. Maybe this is just what happens to a game that has a development model like this, profits go lower as the year wears on, but a new expac is how they recovered last time. Despite the leaps and bounds in improvement the storytelling and new maps have made, profits are down and we know this time that they intend to move right into Season 5 after this one ends. 
---
I wonder if they plan on introducing expansion-level features into the release of Season 5, like new elite specs or another gameplay revamping feature like mounts or gliders. If we assume that season 5 will only bring the same features as this one, maybe 1 or 2 new mounts, then its a little worrying. 
---
Then again, the recent episode wasn't included in this quarter so that is likely why the numbers are lower. They seem fairly satisfied with having their profits within the 19-25 billion Won range. Also, Anet doesn't like sharing future plans in detail with us anymore so I hope they have something big up their sleeves that will bring expac-level profits.
---
Chabs!
---
What WvW announcement hype?
---
No.
---
absolutely, we got something for novelties that assign hotkeys to them, but i'd love a toolbar with hotkeys.
---
Headpiece is the winged headpiece and he looks to be wearing the legendary pve shoulders 
---
Even the non-story content is becoming less and less repeatable :/
---
The last few fractals have posed little challenge.  The achievements are just a time investment really.  Most of them can barely be called achievements anymore and are better served as a checklist of content to explore.  The list goes on...
---
Yeah, I know the usual response is, "take a break" or "this game just isn't marketed to your playstyle",  but it just suuuuuuuuucks that there's little market for people like me here.
---

Supposedly we are getting an announcement this week. With how often we get thrown a bone, it's pretty hype. Hopefully news or a release date for Alliances.
---
Awesome! Returning player here and I cant believe I ever stopped. More in love with the game than ever and like you said havent even done crafting or dungeons. Hope you continue having fun!
---
I think they're just taking more time to expand their scope and make a more robust expansion. Personally speaking, conflating the time required to make PoF and the time required to make a good expansions fails as a premise for me because I don't consider PoF a good expansion.
---
The story was solid and mounts were good. However, the maps, especially in regards to repeatable content were, and still are, buggy and underwhelming and the elite specs were overpowered as hell and threw a massive wrench into the game's balance. There's only so much you can do with a good story. People aren't going to replay the personal story every week, let along every day. People were playing the HoT maps and metas up to PoF's launch and are still playing them today. When was the last time you saw someone do the Augury Rock meta, or the Desolation meta? Let's not even talk about the Desert Highlands meta which is hot garbage, even in comparison to the Desolation meta which is likely to just randomly bug out irreparably and the only reason the people suffer through Serpent's Ire is because it's required for two collections. The primary content of PoF could have used more time. If an expansion that's better than PoF takes more time than PoF, then I'm happy to wait. Because I don't want another PoF where people barrel through the expansion maps and then two months later the expansion content is dead because nobody wants to deal with it.

&gt; If you got a skin from tp or gemstore it would be cool if you could delete that skin from ur bag/bank but still have that one free transmute. Or an option to make it into a transmutation charge.
---
I think this could quite easily be done, by salvaging the skin. It would unlock that skin to your account, and give you a transmutation charge.
---
It's unfortunate. There has hardly been a day over the past...15 years that I have not thought about this franchise. Lately I have trouble caring. The maps are so disjoint and isolated, and once you do map completion all you can do is an hourly meta event for a skin you may or may not care about. This game is absolutely marketed to my playstyle because the number of hours I can play is as casual as you can get, but I can't bring myself to make up random goals to chase after for no reason.
---
If Anet was here, they would delete your post and ban you. The Mods here are fair and lenient, unlike the forum nazis at Anet. 
---
Oh wait, I get it.  I didn't include a nude in this post, that's why the negative karma
---
&gt; good amount of hours   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; (we are lvl 8 or 9) 
---
Is that even possible
---
1. Main Quest starts at lvl 10 and which is continued every 10 lvls (Iirc)
---
2. You get everywhere enough exp to lvl reliably but best would be to aim at zones in your lvl range.
---
3. Mounts are only for POF players. POF will cost irl money.
---
4. Your main weapon skills wont change dramatically for most classes. The looks of them are subjective.
---
5. They tried to throw the holy trinity away, but it exist somehow in form of metabuilds for dedicated healer supporter dd. There is a disparity in dps classes can do at most the builds from the site I'm using are all in the range of 33-38k dps supporter do 15-22k dps. Balance is a complicated concept.
---
6. The P2W thing is complicated. Addons HOT and POF seem mandatory for high end group play. Your bank gets full really fast the same with the base inventory. I calculated for all mxs like Bank inventory and indestructible gathering tools you would pay about 200 bucks at most, that is nothing when compared to annually sub fees. 
---
7. No clue about pvp
---
8. Good content, well designed Fractals, a progression system that starts vertically and then switches to horizontal, non trivial content. Found a nice guild what I think is what is keeping me at the game the most. Active dodging.
---
You should atleast try the dungeon at lvl 30 most pve stuff I done till now are about the challenge they offer.
---
See? now you‚Äôre getting the hang of it.
---
Die 1000 deaths 
---
Been playing the game since launch and still do (max 30 minutes a day or so) but I am not surprised by the revenue drop.
---
* Months between two hours story content
---
* No reason for veterans to repeat hearts unless you absolutely need that 3 silver, some bogus mini or some ascended trinket that is worse than what you currently have since years ago
---
* Once you are happy with your skins there is no carrot on the stick. Vertical progression not a solution of course but something meaningful to strive for should be there. Fishing? Housing? Mini battles? More masteries?
---
* New fractals are too long, full of gimmicks and take far too long to develop. No new assets apart from a few things and voice files
---
* Non-HoT events are very meh, just fetching 125 billion junk items or escort some random dude, rewards just 3 silver or so and that 200 karma
---
I know this is just the way gw2 is but it is not a recipe for big money.
---
Entitled much? Yes I am but that doesn't mean I can't critize a declining game.
---
Yeah I went here when I was still kinda new and saw a vid that said this is a good place to grind hero points. Boy that vid must've been outdated. At least now I know PoF essentially gives a free full elite spec since the HPs are easy to come by.
---
I think they should tackle this by adding guild content or giving bonuses to do existing content as a guild. By added incentives to play with a guild, you create communities of people that play together. Alliances may do this but I think there should be a pve incentive as well.
---
Things would help a lot if certain QoL features were actually added to the game.
---
Sure they won't be the sole reason for success but no matter how much short term, long term content is thrown out.. If things like QoL features, Pvp not being addressed at its core, balancing correctly and wvw having actual progress (I say this knowing there is an announcement due).. People will either pop in and out only or those who stay ingame spend less if anything at all as there is no need.
---
Ugh the evicerates that MISSED
---
Verrrrrry impressive..
---
Its reddit. It's not exclusive to this sub. It's just the way it is. Not worth getting down or irritated over. :)
---
The most important thing is content.
---
Things like quality of life or engine updates are pointless if there's no game to play.
---
I found a group just asking people, near the story entrance, if they needed party. Try that too, most people get stuck in that part of the story so they wait there to see if anyone else can help. Is not that hard once you know how the stages work, but can be long if you cant do much damage and sucks having to fight everyone again if you die trying the story alone. The most annoying is the flying really.
---
Yup! Been about that long for me as well. Welcome back!
---
Seriously, DS is A+, killing kralky in an instance alone seems so underwelming to me... 
---
1. In the last two days I had really relaxing and enjoyable full runs (cms+t4+recs), between 60-85 minutes (started 10 minutes before reset), and while fb/ren are really welcomed alternatives for variation in the current meta, support chrono, now called hybrid chrono, is perfectly viable for fractals and pugs.
---
2. 100% is desired, but how you get it, is up to you. With high ar over 150 and potions, you can compensate lacking diviner stats for example and concentration food is quite cheap. Mix zerk, assassin and divinier as you need. When at 100%, look if you can get around 65% crit chance as well to reach 100% with a bs and a druid in your group.
---
3. Before a boss encounter, prestack at the singularity. Start with time warp, both wells, and then cast shield 5 and during its animation cs and soi (practice that if needed). Repeat shield 5 and soi after cs ends, pick up the singularity and start the fight. There might be other prestack rotations; I found this one useful. Many pug druids will start to stack might when they see time warp - i delay my sois a bit then to expand the 25 might stack as well. If you have weavers or holos in your group, ask them to start prestacking and cast after their fire field, or they will blast into your time warp for chaos armor.
---
My starter in fight after prestacking: sword 3, shield 5+cs (again, during the cast of shield 5), time warp, soi, recall well, action well (cs will end bwfore action is on cd, so no second action, but that's ok because of time warp os still running), recall well, soi, swap weapon, focus 5, heal signet, focus 5.
---
The rest is practice. Some tipps:
---
- avoid swapping back to shield before you cast a third focus 5 phantasm - this way you can be sure, that shield 5 will be off cooldown
---
- hold wells and soi on cd unless you have cs up soon (takes experience)
---
- shatter your phantasms, when you have 3 up, unless you have cs ready soon (experience, sometimes you are inside heavy aoes and need to distort - then use sword 3 and run the starter routine for cs with one clone)
---
- during cs, your priority skills are shield 5, time warp and soi. You can always cast all three with at least one clone without stress (with practice with no clone); evrything else is a cherry on top - that said, prefer recall over action well
---
- if you have no clones up (between fights or while phantasms are up) you can shatter to get free seconds of alacrity) - but spare shatter 3 if you know you need it for the extra cc
---
- hold sword 2 off cd to maximize your damage, unless you know you can use it in the next seconds for damage mitigation BUT
---
- if you have to mitigate damage, prefer shield 4 over sword 2 to fish for a de ja vue (the extra shield 4 when you block a hit with it)
---
- sword 3 is a fantastic skill for closing gaps. Use the leap everytime, to start it's cd faster
---
- all skills, that generate clones (like sword 3) can be used on invulnerable or ‚Äúengaging‚Äú enemies (like all bosses in nightmare, cpt ashym, charr boss while shielded in chaos fractal, artsariiv in 100cm, etc.); use it to precast your clone for cs
---
- all skills, that generate phantasms (like focus 5, shield 4), will fail on invulnerable targets or when you are blind (looking at your, bird instability). avoid wasting them this way
---
- there are tons of more tipps regarding other utility stuff like mimic, focus pulls, blinks, portals and stuff, but this should give you an insight into the potential and behavior of the class as boon support
---
Surprised Aion is doing so well
---
IRL and In Game too
---
I would play games at 4 fps if the content is good.
---
I saw the sketch of this a while back but my god it looks so amazing with the coloring! 
---
It can be a very draining mission , mainly because if you wipe you start from the beginning. You didn't really say what your spec was but condi warrior should be quite decent. Longbow berserker is great dps and if you bring the right utilities, it can help enormously. I would always bring shake it off, shattering blow and it would be a toss up between for great justice and maybe a defensive stance or perhaps endure pain.
---
I get some Final Fantasy vibes from this guy.
---
I don‚Äôt know. The problem with zones like that is that they eventually go the way of so much other content in that people stop doing them. There‚Äôs already too much forgotten and abandoned content in this game like that. 
---

The most recent lore piece I consumed was [the complete season 1 movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d17gwV4vXOg). Towards the end you see a teacher talking about Elder Dragons being strong forces of nature, and when they act you cannot blame them for acting the way they do. They appear, cause lingering effect on the earth and disappear, just like tornados or earthquakes.
---
Considering this, and Deep Sea Dragon's visible effects on the Tyria, I'd say it's not a theory I'd support, but crackpot indeed.

I‚Äôm personally hoping for a map like this set in the Mists. It would be neat to get an open world map set in the Mists a la the Domain of Anguish in GW1. 
---
Content is most important for an existing game. A new game should have updated features. They may as well just do a huge xpac revising the whole game and continuing as GW2 if they are not going to use a new engine etc etc which is pretty much what WoW xpacs do anyway.
---
i'd say for gw2, give us everything we want. play in a tuxedo or biker jacket, fly battle dragons and lance raptors on the ground, revamp the gui with lots of modifiers and filters, give us templates and battle minis (or what ever is popular/needed/wanted)
---
and most of all, make weapon and armour skins that are must have, not meh.
---
put the one best team on living world stories and the other teams on qol to give the fans what they want and god damn advertise it and watch this game hit the charts
---
Type|Parts
---
:--|:--
---
You will definitely get by with English, the majority of mapchat and squadchat will be in English either way. People rarely type in other languages, unless the squad ist marked with a flag other than the American one.
---
As for ping I heard it isn't that bad. 
---
I noticed that too. I would run with a small Zerg group nowadays.

Same. My IGN is Distinguished.6531 if you guys wanna add me. We can all be new(ish) together.

You don't both NEED to get credit/xp. You join him doing his for fun, then he joins you in yours for fun. It's only a handful of quests every ten levels or so (and you don't have to do them as soon as you get them; you can wait as long as you want to tackle that stuff). 
---
Don't get me wrong, personal story is a fun experience, but it's not the majority of the content you'll be doing with your brother. Go explore, do hearts, do dynamic events together, etc. And when you decide to tackle personal story, don't sweat not getting progress/credit -- every segment of quests will probably take you thirty minutes or less. You sacrifice nothing, really.

Druid and chrono and firebrand and renegade.   Those 4 classes can save a shit group with the amount t of options they have

How do mobile games make so much damn money? I've only played like 2 decent mobile games, and even those are highly repetitive and feel like half a game, if even that. And the others I've played are complete trash.  With pretty much every game developer heading towards mobile gaming, console and pc gaming in general is headed for a big decline. Sad times.... 
---
Lol I forgot this even existed.
---
Nobody unfairly singles out anything and downvotes it -- you're just in a subreddit of people who clearly really enjoy the game, and thus probably happen to disagree with people who dislike it. If you go hang out at the front row of an Adele concert and then proceed to criticize Adele, what kind of response do you think you'd get? Of *course* the people who are fans of something probably aren't going to respond kindly to negativity about the thing they like.
---
That said, you must be blind or selectively read just to complain I guess, because there *is* a fair amount of criticism of ANet here that doesn't get downvoted to oblivion. It makes it to the front page frequently.
---
Funny this account awakes every few months only to post NCSoft financial reports.
---
While I'll freely admit I spend VERY little time in PoF maps because there's a lack of replayability, I think that might be by design.  Locking rewards or earning potential behind certain content is part of how they'll keep their releases earning money in the future.  If PoF offered everything HoT did, then future additions to the community might not buy HoT.  The same goes for Living World.  S3 maps are still relevant enough that we recommend new players pick them up when they can, even if it's just for the trinkets.  As a new player, you'll want HoT for the metas (and gliding and some key elite specs), at least some S3 episodes for the trinkets (if you're running almost any meta other than full zerk), and PoF for mounts (and other key elite specs).  
---
I picked up both xpacs before they launched, but I know this method makes it harder for newer players to catch up.  They're trying to walk a fine line.  GW2 is still a fairly 'casual' game, as far as MMORPG's go, but it's still an MMORPG.    I also think that *if* that's the reason for the content being designed the way it is that they could do a better job of balancing it, and I completely agree that PoF could have been better.  I'm very much looking forward to a new xpac, but I'm also more than happy to wait if the next one has more/better content and is way less buggy.
---
Aww, that‚Äôs the first I‚Äôve heard of that. Thanks for letting me know, though.
---
New story content comes out every 2 - 4 months.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World should have all the information you're looking for.
---
not a decent pvper myself, i wouldnt be too worried about winning, since loosing still reward progression, if you do choose the pvp route make sure you have arah story done, it rewards the pvp track for you. There are lots of afk farmers in pvp, the thing is if you join enough pvp matches you will have a set of armor eventually.
---
Nothing at all!
---
320
---
Mallyx Legend, Pain Absorption. You get extra resistance from traits in Corruption and Invocation too
---
Completely wrong. ESO pushes out content much faster than GW2.
---
Regarding gear in particular, they come in importance of Boon Duration &gt; Power/Precision &gt; Ferocity. You'll want to aim for 85% BD, which becomes 100% BD with fractal pots and 150AR. The most optimal way to get these attributes is to get all of your BD strictly from Diviner's and the rest go full DPS gear/sigils/runes/food, but if obtaining Diviner's weapons+armor is difficult, here's a pretty easy setup you can do:
---
\- Diviner's trinkets: +\~39% BD (bought with laurels or LWS3/4 trinkets, winterberries would be the easiest LW currency to get)
---
\- Weapons/Armor are all zerk's (on support chrono in particular, power and precision are almost equal value, so don't feel obligated to hit crit cap)
---
\- Pack runes: +15% BD (better than Leadership since it gives more power and precision, also maintains fury for your group)
---
\- Sigil of concentration: +10% BD
---
\- Concentration food (Soul Pastry): +6% BD
---
\- Concentration utility: Peppermint Oil for a cheap option (+4% BD), Potent Lucent Oil for a more expensive option (+9% BD)
---
This puts you at at least 74% boon duration, which becomes 89% BD after pots. This should be good enough for daily T4s, and if you want to get into raids (where you need only 60-70% BD), you can take power food instead of concentration food. You can also work slowly towards obtaining a few Diviner's weapons/armor later if you really want to optimize things further.
---
Very nice collection OP!  
---
I honestly don't know because it was a mix of purchases between alt accounts, other players, and the trading post.
---
I started the festival with between 11-12k gold, and about 3k worth of TP listings (post tax).  I'm ending it with 20k gold and ~9k worth of TP listings (post tax).
---
I didn't track it well enough to give a good answer to you here other than I made a fuckton more than I thought I would before the event started.
---
This was predictable considering the sheer amount of sales they did over a 3 month span. *"WE AREN'T SELLING ENOUGH! SALE! EVERYTHING IS ON SALE!"*
---
Wish ar was account bound
---
&gt; people bash it but
---
No one bashes the Dragons Stand meta. Its really well done and it shows the massive scale Mord had. What we *do* bash is how he looks in the final instance where we fight him.
---
That's only true for zones that lack a meta and rewards. Dragons Stand is always going on when reset happens because it has important rewards tied to it. 
---
Let's just throw in some instabilities. Just to make sure everyone is satisfied. 
---
Wildstar. It died.
---
Not dead yet: 
---
WoW - vertical gear progression (not something GW2 can or should emulate, appears to be finally tiring its userbase with BfA)
---
Path of Exile - random gear drops with incremental crafting improvements of exponentially increasing difficulty to obtain (still tires out playerbase once they obtain it or hit a plateau), crossed with approximately quarterly seasonal content featuring new systems allowing for alt reroll
---
Warframe - short replayable matches with potential large variance of gameplay due to different weapons and ‚Äòclasses‚Äô, immensely long lateral progression grind that is timegated or shortcut with real money currency (some of it is remniscent of GW2, but where GW2 fails is the lack of quick soloable/groupable feels-good/fast content to jump in and out from; may and probably has also tired out veterans over time), oh and roughly quarterly updates with new systems and massive dev communication
---
I‚Äôd love for people who know more to break down stuff like FF14, MHW, etc.
---
&gt; The maps are so disjoint and isolated,
---
I really loved the fact they connected Vabbi to Kourna with Jahai. It was a really nice touch and should be encouraged more. I had hoped EP5 to be West of Jahai for a better cohesion but instead we were thrown up north. *sigh*
---
I wonder about the possibility of maybe re-purposing it into like a WvW lobby area in the same vein as like the the PvP one? Like with EotM, I honestly don't know if there would ever really be a way for them to revamp it effectively enough, especially with it needing to be in a secondary position to core WvW. It feels like if it was a lobby area for WvW then it could see it flourish again, but in a new capacities. Like it could continue to fulfill the purpose of being able to teach people aspects of WvW with areas dedicated to different things (while having things that they can practice on or - in the case of the golems, charr car, banners, etc - with the skillbar of), be a useful area to recruit people when the upcoming Alliances changes hit, continue to offer a place for people to shop for WvW stuff without taking up a potential que spot in core WvW maps, could maybe restructure the GvG/duel area into something that people could possibly get better use out of (like the option to pick what color you are so you can fight guild's that might be allied with/same color in a matchup if you wanted), potentially offer like leaderboards they could do and be presented on the map, be a place for people to spam click the WvW portals at reset besides LA, preserver aspects of the dev work that went into making the map, and ensure that the map will always have a significant amount of life to it.
---
But I really don't know. Like I can't actually think of a way for them to make it work as a WvW map, while balancing it with core WvW. It seems like everything they could try with it is going to be a tug-of-war that would be a nightmare to get right and maintain on it's own, let alone with also dealing with other areas of the game. To me, this feels like a way that ANet can respectfully retire the map while doing something cool with it.
---
This is amazing, do you do commissions? :eyes:
---
I can only hope they've been deliberately misleading about a third expansion in order to make it an actual surprise, after what happened with PoF getting leaked two whole episodes before release.
---
It's nice that they've been getting more ambitious with LW episodes, both in terms of masteries and also in terms of story impact, but I don't think they can coast on it forever.
---
LW just doesn't have the same level of mystique as launching an expansion with multiple zones in a previously-unexplored region, with new masteries that completely change movement forever, and new elite specs that change combat forever. Those were what Path of Fire was. LW feels like "more business as usual". An expansion with masteries and specs on par with PoF is another "the game is forever changed".
---
The problem with PoF, though, was that the story had too many pointless / fetchy / padded sections. It followed the season 3 model where the story conveniently funnels you through every renown heart with contrived excuses, rather than allowing the zone to stand up on its own, tied only to the story by virtue of location.
---
If we get a third expansion, I hope that:
---
1) The maps stand on their own from the story, and the story doesn't force you through every heart.
---
2) The story has the intensity of season 4. I'm sure everyone has problems with at least some of the writing this season, but it has been consistently well-paced, emotional, and climactic. Every episode has had at least one huge story beat that kicked off rampant speculation. Of course, you don't get speculation if it's all dumped at once in an expansion, but the only real memorable parts in PoF to me were the commander dying and the final fight. The rest is pretty much a blur. In season 4: Taimi being captured under Istan, the raid on Rata Primus, infiltrating the Moon Fortress, escaping the mists after leaving Blish behind, and the Kralkatorrik fight were all memorable.
---
3) The expansion zones need to feel dangerous again. Path of Fire was way too safe. Hell, Vabbi was one of the safest zones in the game, and while justified by the story, it doesn't exactly make a compelling finale.
---
4) Masteries need to be as game-changing as mounts. I don't know how, unfortunately.
---
I agree and would really like this, but I just came to say that "upsetti spaghetti" got a significant giggle from me. Thank you. 
---
thats what i meant...people bash the instance fight...i thought its one of the best story boss fights in the game, and actually has a penalty for dying.
---
...he just thicc...
---
Just out of curiosity ... what would be soo bad about mounts in WvW?
---
what If they only made it so mounts worked in controled areas - as in areas of the map controlled by your side - like gliders work.
---
They might have, but the problem is what they have said a lot more recently. 
---
To give one [example](https://www.mmorpg.com/guild-wars-2/interviews/guild-wars-2-gamescom-2018-interview-looking-back-at-living-world-1000012975#xUIwpcoLe2QjMJVZ.99):  
---
In this interview Mike Zadorojny (game director) is asked the following: "*Why did you decide to continue the Living World and go straight from Season 4 to Season 5 rather than say, work on an expansion in the background?*"  
---
The second part of this sentence seems to imply that season 5 is being worked on instead of an expansion. He isn't asking "why deliver season 5 before expac", or "why deliver season 5 instead of expac", he's asking why deliver season 5 instead of *working on an expansion*. If I were a game director I would at least correct the interviewer here, but Mike is just answering the question and completely ignoring this seemingly pretty massive implication. Another issue is that whenever they are asked if they are still working on an expac they completely refuse to even acknowledge the question. They're not asked about sepcifics, or a release date, jsut wether expacs are still on the proverbial table. That's a pretty easy "yes", if you're actually working on an expac, because you're revealing jack shit. Instead not even acknowledging the question seems to not have many advantages. I'Ve heard this issue come up 5 times over the past week in different meta events, so it seems the rumor that GW2 won't have another expac is growing. That's not a rumor you want to have, especially when a potential reveal could still be a year off. That's more than a year of your customers questioning their gem purchases and debating wether they should stick around if LW is all they get. So to not just kill that rumor by answering a simple yes/no question with 1 word seems a little weird.
---
I mean, when you‚Äôve got 2 or 3 map blobs it would honestly just be a crapshow.... and then it would give teams a huge advantage based on where people are fighting, it would be horrible for framerates....
---
I‚Äôve heard from over a dozen people who basically say they‚Äôll quit the game if it happens a, and not a single person supporting it...
---
Little late here, But don't you say that the dps revenant bring in this situation equal or better than druid buff?? (because druid can't deal any dps on their own)
---
If one or two fo your teammate dies, druid can't bring dps but rev could.
---
specifically because you brought dialogues into the table, I have to say that it's hands down [gw2's world's cutest contestant](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Yokko).
---
but other than that, it's obiviously the one and only [GW2's Best Girl](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lord_Faren).
---
probably something from me, if I ever post something relevant.
---
He looks like he's from a furry mobile game kek.
---
I think the strangest thing is they butchered it in a way where you can't even reliably obtain the **eotm achievement points** in there at a decent pace. Pretty sure one of them is cap 1750 gens... ooooof. RIP to anyone who didn't play the map when it was in it's hay-day. You gonna be in there for a loooong time solo'ing stuff.
---
Definitely most pugs don't stand in wells due to not paying attention or low visibility with low graphics and overwhelming effects spam from GW2 combat nature, it can help sometimes to just say 'stay inside the purple-ish circles for alacrity/quickness'.
---
I don't know how many of each piece you need to get max BD but around 97,8%~ should get you to max duration already (almost same as 100% but yeah), as suggested LWS3 trinkets would be the easiest, for weapons/armor you can use the Fractal vendor and craft with grandmaster marks etc or raid currency if you don't feel like farming the new map.
---
If you do go for full diviner's you can probably run power/precision food + sharpening stone.
---
Rotation-wise i always have 2 wells + SoI, heal signet and Time warp, prestack whenever possible.
---
My prestack CS rotation (0 clones): Drop TimeWarp &gt; WoA/cs at the end of the cast &gt; WoR/cs ends &gt; WoA &gt; WoR &gt; ToT &gt; SoI. Should give roughly 25-30s of quickness/alacrity to everybody.
---
CS rotation in combat (1 clone): WoR/cs at the end of cast &gt; WoA &gt; Time Warp &gt; ToT/cs ends &gt; ToT (you'll get -20s from catching both ToT's) then just Wells/SoI off cooldown pretty much, i personally use Bundles (Metal Rod, Wooden Plank, Rock) for CC.
---
WvW exclusive Dolyak mounts here we come
---
Exactly. There are honestly so many reasons not too, and few reasons to.
---
Basically, mounts are what killed open world pvp in WoW at least. You could just mount your flying mount and go up and not be in any real danger.
---
It could be bit same thing. See enemy? Mount up and run away. Any sense of danger is gone. Specially when mounts are instant cast and not 1.5 seconds they used to be in wow (now 0.5s)
---
Oh and with bunny you'd be able to just reach places others can't.
---
It still serves its purpose; **WvW players can go to when all borderlands are queued**. Besides, there are vendors etc that players might need so without the map it'd suck to have to wait in Q just to access WvW related vendors.
---
You know what was wasted dev time? When they added the so called GvG arena in eotm... wayyyyyyy toooooo lateeee. Sigh.
---
Well, there‚Äôs a difference there.. there‚Äôs not much ‚Äúcare‚Äù from the general populace about a speedy fractal clear. But talk about something they can relate to, and it‚Äôll be popular.
---
THis looks great!! FANTASTIC color and shading work. 
---
My suggestion is to look at how cat toe paws work because they look slightly like fingers, but overall they are pretty üëå
---
For HoT, expect to die quite few times compared to "old world". HoT is more group-oriented and event-oriented. Also seems to have bit of influence from Dark souls since that was hype back then.
---
There are lot of events where you build up for the grand meta-definer with either bosses or something (octovine).
---
It gets time to get used to, but I'm sure you can do it!
---
If you want to check tactics on metas, see (Eva guilds guides)[http://evaguild.com/]. Some are bit outdated because you can cheese mechanics by sheer out-dps and sustain but still.
---
For PoF? it's more solo-oriented. Not massive metas (those are for living world maps). But the world and experience is amazing. Bit less stress on enemies being on your butt all the time. 
---
For PoF all i can say is, EXPLORE! Oh and no, ya can't solo bounties so don't spawn them alone. Oops.
---
Most people just stack up at Matriarch spawn at reset, nuke it in a few minutes for the chest, and then move on to Tangled Depths for Gerent.
---
&gt; I wonder about the possibility of maybe re-purposing it into like a WvW lobby area
---
I wonder if this isn't more or less what we will get today.
---
i am so excited for you!!!!! you havent even started the real content!! have fun and enjoy the ride!!!
---
Saying "ele" is pretty vague.
---
There's support Tempest and a large variety of DPS Tempests and Weavers.
---
Overall, it's a strong and versatile profession like it always has been.
---
&gt; otherwise you'll just be wasting XP
---
not until the final mastery
---
While everyone can mill over the issues plaguing GW2 the thing people seem to miss here is that the space that MMORPGs occupy has eroded over the past 15 years.
---
MMORPGs were (and still) social platforms, you played them largely in part to make friends. However with the rise of platforms such as a Steam and Discord, the big draw of them; play games with your friends is not as unique. I can play anything, while talking to whomever I please thanks to these platforms, which means I never have to log into GW2 (or other games) unless I want to.
---
I used to like MMORPGs for not just the game play, but also the social aspects, making friends, building up guilds, adventuring together and just shooting the breeze. 
---
Okay here goes, I've written some sort of underwater expansion concept wich inplies just this and also that Quaggans are her minions.
---
some snippets:
---
**Melaggan the Sleeping Dragon**  
---
She is a huge Quaggan Queen sleeping on the bottom of the ocean accompanied by a city of followers and a caste of priests and priestesses that after initiation as a tadpole have to sing ‚ÄúThe Eternal Lullaby‚Äù to keep the Queen asleep. 
---
While she sleeps she hums the lullaby at such a low frequency that normal ears can‚Äôt hear it.  Deepsea Quaggans refer to this humming as ‚ÄúThe Hymn of the Deep‚Äù.  
---
Melaggan sleeps on a crack on the bottom of a trench absorbing all the ley-energy that seeps through, this ley-energy has formed a cocoon around her.  
---
Melaggan has no corruption like the other dragons do except for the ‚Äúenrage‚Äù property which changes body and mind, but can be doused. Her name starts with an "S" when she's enraged (like Jeckyll and Hyde)  
---
Ley energy in water diffuses and imbues the water effectively making the entire ocean a ley-line energy hub just very diffused.  The Hymn pacifies otherwise very hostile seacreatures but creatures that are in places where the Hymn is not strong enough tend to ‚Äúenrage‚Äù which results in attacks. 
---
Some of these creatures are told about in legends. Only the really big Creatures are capable of crossing the dead zone between the surfacewaters and the bottom of the ocean although quaggans must have found a way long ago since they are here.  The Ley-energy carries and amplifies the Hymn making use of the Ley-lines as a globe spanning communication device.  
---
The Eternal Lullaby and the Hymn are the same song just at a different speed and tonehight. 
---
And about the orb inside the underwater city:
---
All Quaggans come here to praise the six (not the six we know ;) yet)  
---
The Quaggan Six are the six first eggs Melaggan has laid and have crystallized, these eggs ward of any corruption from the other dragons and keep Melaggan doused. One was stolen by the Krait and later retrieved by the Largos and currently resides in camp Trinity.   
---
Sure.  Just let me hop on my raptor and run into a zerg and use my skill to pull them into a neat pile for cleaving.
---
Oh hi Ross. 
---
GW2 does not run smoothly, as there are different amounts of players at different occasions, but if you are willing to sacrifice amount of skin, effects and people (inc. their names) you wish to see at any given time (i.e. lowest) you cold reach some sort of consistency.
---
While i'm not sure about exact parts in this laptop, the numbers seem enough to play gw2.
---
I‚Äôve sent tickets to support twice about this issue and they blamed my antivirus both times. Adding the exceptions to my firewall and my AV fixed most of them though.
---
Just expect it to be something you don't care about or find significant. 
---
Even if it was about mounts they ain't going to change their mind just because you posted this.
---
Just wait for the announcement and see what they say :)
---
I‚Äôm scared for tomorrow now...
---
Wildstar.
---
It is reason why no developer shoud listen to hardcore players.
---
Outflanking slippery firebleeding crystals ? I'm sold.
---
Those kill stealers, man.
---
lol, for sure
---
Maybe they could re-purpose this 
---
Gw1 Mobile wouldn't be wildly successful
---
I'd like to see it as an alternative EB maybe 
---
T1,T3,T5 = EB Map
---
T2, T4 = EOTM Map
---
Off course it would need a few adjustments first 
---
I did not promise proper, i imagine something like: weld/launch spear, bash through enemies, maybe bite them for small damage, [removed]
---
I'd like to take this chance to elaborate on some of the reasons for my own dislike of the map.
---
Now, to get this part out of the way: The fight against Mordremoth itself? Totally fine. The march through the zone? Totally fine. Neither of these were bad.
---
What is bad about the map is the fact that you cannot complete the map without going through the meta.
---
When the meta isn't being progressed, the zone essentially locks off the blighting towers and everything beyond it. There are ways to bypass that of course, but require probing invisible walls in a way that is basically map breaking.
---
When I go through a zone, I want to beat the zone. I want to go in, clear it out, get my reward, and then say "I have beaten this" and walk away. You can do this to practically every map, with rare exceptions requiring an event or two. But Dragon stand demands you go through the entire thing to get map completion.
---
Until I found my method, Any characters I tried to "Complete" HoT on always stopped at dragon stand. There was neither point nor possibility since I was never around when a meta was going. And if the next map demands that, I will decry that again, since it isn't fun to lock out map completion like that.
---
However, if the map, say, lets you go get all the POI's and Vistas and all that stuff alone, while still being based around a cool as hell meta event? That is perfectly fine. Tarir was like that, and tarir is one of my favorite events. Tangled depths was like that, and you could get around verdant brinks night system by going through a specific path meant to access a jumping puzzle.
---
I don't mind map metas, they are generally pretty cool and tend to have the occasional decent reward. What I dislike is not having a choice in the matter. Give me the ability to get map completion and you can do whatever you want with a meta.
---
That's my two copper at any rate.
---
Imagine attacking a keep and then 30 Bunnies rain on top of your head with their knockdown. Or you getting pulled together because someone used their raptor in enemy territory. Or the defender using the Jackal to get barrier. You basically would make attacking anything a lot harder and unforgiving in a very cheap way.
---
I also don't think that Mounts are really that good in WvW because you would have to remove everything that makes them special like the attack skills and then they are only used for traversing the area BUT you can't do that in enemy territory at which it would make the most sense, but then you have the problem of players being able to jump over walls.
---
well, if they let us know the wont do alliances 
---
I bash a lot of PvP/WvW Anet stuff, and generally don‚Äôt get down voted. You just need to word your posts constructively, and not come off as a whiny brat. 
---
Is base rev allowed?
---
make sure youre literally in combat. just drawing your weapon won't work :D
---
Thing is, there is nothing wrong with wanting others to pull their own weight.  
---
Obviously you will still get some really obnoxious raid leaders who will take it too far, but that's something that's been around since day 1.
---
Try again during prime times and tag up if there is no commander!
---
Yes!
---
Dry top has 40 events. Verdant Brink daytime has 55 events just during daytime alone. Nighttime events add at least 8 more counting the bosses and defend/escort/etc. events. I can understand why Dry Top might feel like it has more events since a lot of Verdant Brinks events are ‚Äúchain events‚Äù with less being standalone, but VB does have more events and more going on than Dry Top or most core maps.  There is certainly a ‚Äúfocus‚Äù in VB vs Dry Top/Core, which I guess can lead to making it feel less varied, but lack of variety isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. It‚Äôs really just a subjective thing where some players will prefer hot meta type maps vs ‚Äúmore variety‚Äù core types.  And let‚Äôs be honest you can call ‚Äú90% of hot maps a massive waste of time and resources when the meta isn‚Äôt running‚Äù but isn‚Äôt that every map? HoT maps still have tons of exploration aspects, side quests, adventures, and all the other things that make other maps fun to play, and it‚Äôs not like you _have to_ join for the entire meta event to do events in those maps 
---
A lot of the PvP meta relies heavily on the elite specs, in both sPvP and WvW, so...
---
I agree with this, but I'm willing to put up with those flaws if there's a variety of content to do with interesting cosmetic rewards. When I buy an expansion, give me 4 dungeons at launch. Have a raid wing a few weeks after launch with more wings every 3-4 months. Add difficulty levels. Bring back dungeon set armors. An expansion feels so naked when it ships with 0 instanced content.
---
Add more guild missions. They were such a unique type of content in between dungeons and raiding. Such wasted potential. 
---
Have a collection achievement involving races that rewards mount skins. I got tired of only getting weapon skins as rewards, with armor pieces being drip fed and each piece being locked behind drawn out scavenger hunts.
---
And on the subject of events, they have quests in the game, I don't know why they're so shy about them. The Caladbolg collection was an excellent quest chain. Quests aren't bad, you just need to design them well. And maybe spread development time out a bit so they're not focusing on story quests that last all of 2 hours.
---
For someone who runs and comms DS almost every day, I couldn't disagree more. DS is for me 10/10 mmo-map. Thing that got me into MMOs in first place - like open world raid.
---
But that's subjective.
---
What I find funny is how HoT maps were complained to be just these huge metas and full of events and not a single breathing-room..
---
So they made PoF maps with small events and basically no metas.
---
Now some people whine PoF maps are useless and dead and have no reason to be after map completion. And people "love" living world maps with metas and all that. Some people say Istan is 10/10 and that's not even for the money. Jahai bluffs was praised when it had buttloads of events and something to do all the time.
---
Can't win.
---
&gt; make your character look as good as possible and then get good at PVP
---
* generally, everyone in pvp will not be seeing your looks, only a default model
---
&gt; Is this really enough to justify the price?
---
No, because you get much more than what you stated. If you are f2p and like what you already have definitely buy expansions, if you are core player, and fine with what you have, still why not -if you spend time on gw2 there will be more stuff to do now.
---
and the money is the problem,  obv. don't.
---
you should've searched for the other billion threads asking the same thing
---
They're definitely still doing that. They're never doing seasons/tournaments again because it resulted in a permanent drop in WvW playership.
---
&gt; I was thinking of replacing 
---
and food
---
Well, that was easy
---
The real reason we lost in All or Nothing was we fought alone with NPCs rather than as the community. :)
---
No pips and also less reward track progress
---
&gt; Myrtenaster
---
technically it shoots raw magic dust projectiles so is considered also a range weapon, besides the ability to combine with Weiss semblance.
---
When open it looks like a normal gun.
---
It was pleasant to find Jaune's weapon still being Melee after what happened at Vol. 3
---
Crazy thought I know, but maybe, people gave a difference in opinions and so downvoted you as they disagreed with what you posted?
---
If only my friends were this easy to convince
---
Mate, put down that tinfoil hat. You're not downvoted because of Anet, it's because you behave like an asshole. Learn how to communicate.
---
FF14 has 
---
-accessible Raids. with easy mode and dutyfinder
---
-truely hard content with prestigous rewards
---
-a shtton of repeatable content updates with crossovers to other popular series
---
-Subsystems(like housing) and minigames (golden saucer, mahjong)
---
-a ridiculously big modding community
---
-and an Expansion soon.
---
gw2 has
---
-a bit of Story every couple of months and is bleeding in every other aspect (raids,wvw,pvp)
---
Queuing in OS has pros and cons with the change to participation decay. 
---
By queuing in EotM you would be able to continue making some progress on the reward track without wrecking your "normal" WvW participation level.
---
I will add you and others tomorrow when I get on!
---
&gt; the flexibility to swap between Sword Weaver/Staff Weaver/Scepter Tempest
---
What decides you to take the 2nd or the 3rd ? Don't they basically fill the same role, distant aoe/cleave ?
---
Let's not get too hyped about this announcement.... the bigger the hype the bigger the disappointment....
---
guys listen here is what you need to do to make WvW more appealing, its super simple
---
1. rework those pips, a bit  (cause its just too insane  you get 5 if you are the best in map, but you get 8  if you are the worst and outnumbered???? logic? )(not saying it needs to be otherwise, that's a thing to talk about :) )
---
2. rework achievements( like in PvP where the achievement "legendary Champion" is split into many different achievements) that will give players  a feeling like they are working for something not just running around mindlessly
---
3. increase the reward track progress a, bit, cause let's be real nobody plays the mode for loot its so much inferior to PvP or PvE,  give us  a bit more, 
---
4.  and get in some refreshing skins( there is  a reason why everyone gets chaos gloves, they look shiny and cool) give us a chance to get something like that a cool royal guard armor set with a yellow glow( make it not 200lvl gated).
---
  and if you include theese things people will be super happy to go in once more to grind it out, while getting rewarded like you are getting in other modes. 
---
   P.S some other mobility wouldn't hurt ( as in portals to other keeps(you should ask veterans for their suggestion in this)). And yeah im not a native english speaker so i can't express myself very well but i hope you got the idea.
---
[removed]
---
I can easily see them now going with the base idea Gw1 had and changing it so that it suits gw2. They made the skills (masteries) mostly area specific (exluding gliding etc) so that those same skills dont distrupt the meta elswhere in the world. Then they removed dps aspect from them and are mostly mechanic based. Yeah I think they already implemented what I wrote in the post, but as whole new set of skills and not the ones we place as professions. 
---
I agree with you, but I would like to say that dry top is a much smaller map than verdant brink... we should try to calculate the difference. Maybe dry top has more events per square meter?
---
Not that I care, I love the HoT maps but im too burned out to play them at this point
---
I made all my friends in the open world. And lost them to Raids/Fractals.
---
Or craft the others too, with additional cost.
---
^ My go-to strategy with every Gw2 update 
---
Yes.
---
Not everyone is wanking on speedruns, mate.
---
hotkeys to share slots! have my upvote.
---
&gt; Yeah, I know the usual response is, "take a break" or "this game just isn't marketed to your playstyle"
---
"I'm glad that GW2 gives me the time I need to play other games"
---
&gt; FFXIV'
---
I really tried with FFXIV, but after GW2, I just can't get into an MMO that has that structure.
---
It doesn't force you to do those, there is a lot of things to do for someone who's looking for long-term goals, be it legendary crafting, achievement hunting or upgrading your fractal buffs, but i'm not one of those people. You know what kind of game doesn't respect your time? WoW, when it forces you to grind raids and world quests for a random drop, which can also be useless because of this titanforging system, or FF14 which requires you to get through it's boring story and other quests to unlock meaningful content. One of the biggest GW2 pros for me is the freedom to choose what i want to do, and when the game doesn't force me to get through 200 fucking hours of badly written and voiced dialogues just to being able to play it's content, i consider it respecting my time.
---
It's an absolutely beautiful map, with some amazing areas. The main wvw borderlands look completely bland in comparison. It's such a shame to see all that beauty go to waste :(
---
&gt;At this point I'd rather the next expansion bring back quest hubs just so I can have at least a somewhat interesting checklist to get through.
---
That'd be me falling out of GW.
---
I love the dynamic system. "Dynamic" might be the wrong word to use (or just a bit of a buzz-word) but I love how it's area based and calls players together.
---
I tried FFXIV last autumn and I just hated it. The old-school way of having a checklist of quests, and playing what amounts to a dull single-player RPG (because no-one else is doing the same quests as me) just bored me; there's no way I could go back to it.
---
There's a huge difference between the game giving me a chance to play other games because I don't want to fall behind vs a game giving me little desire to log in despite us being only 1 month past a new release.
---
No we had one last week its bi weekly if there is something to release that is. Also announcements are rarely forum posts balance patches are forum posts but thats more announcing a date. 
---
Now everyone becomes a businesses&amp;finances expert lol
---
I have 3 mains basically: Guardian, Ranger and Mesmer, and I am trying to get 3 tiers of looks for each of them. The tiers progress as the lore progresses. For example the first tier is the Order theme and I have a complete look for all three of my chars (Priory Guardian, Vigil Ranger, Whispers Mesmer).
---
The second tier coincides with the time we leave the Pact and go through bit of a soul searching, so the theme is Adventurer or Crafting Master. I have a Blacksmith Guardian and Huntsman Ranger, but I am missing the Tailor Mesmer at the moment.
---
Final tier is 'finding a new home' and each character is themed after a faction that fights against the enemies in Elona (Balthazar, Joko or Kralk). So far I have Sunspear/Primeval Mesmer, Olmakhan Ranger and I am in the process of making a Zephyrite Guardian.
---
I will share you with the pics when I can.
---
I miss you too, man.
---
I'm aware of this, I know it's tied to the buff and that just drawing a weapon shouldn't trigger that (:
---
I'm at work so I can't give you the exact build, but roughly speaking:
---
1. Mostly Valk stats with some marauder/zerk mixed in to give me enough precision (need 30% base crit chance) as well as extra HP since I'm playing with Aussie ping I prefer having a bit more health.
---
2. Radiance trait line all the retaliation traits. This gives me increased crit chance and damage when I have retal on. And it gives me retal when I use a heal skill.
---
3. Valor trait line for the trait that gives you fury when you use a meditation skill.
---
4. Fireworks rune.  I used to run travelers, but switched to fireworks because it gives me a higher burst, the boon duration is great and the movement speed is generally useful. If you want pure damage potential, I think Scholar runes are better, but I like having the movement speed bonus from fireworks rune.
---
5. There's a food that gives you an extra 200 power after using a heal skill.
---
6. Staff and sword/focus
---
7. That signet that gives you more power
---
Under ideal conditions I think I can hit something like 4.5k power with 100% crit chance. Even without ideal conditions I can still reliably hit 3.6k power and 100% crit chance. Holy Strike (staff 2) is a big part of the ranged damage
---
Seriously, adding pips, even at a _reduced_ amount would be enough to make me go there again - I love the map design! Had tons of fun there too! But like you said... No incentive at all.
---
The latest one take 4 times, 3,3,3,1..., that's the problem. The standard one takes 3, as it double strike on every last hit..
---
On Siren's Landing you can also get ascended back items for 300 Pearls and 315k karma for 5 human Gods (example with [Lyssa](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Relic_of_Lyssa)) and once you collected the 5 back items (1500 Pearls and 1.575 million Karma) you get a bonus back item. Since Karma is not an issue for me it's my go-to map when I need a back item because pearls are fairly easy to get, it does not require magic to get them and most other currencies are slower to farm than Pearls imo.
---
&gt; A solution could be to make GW3 happen at the Mists
---
&gt;The MMO market is on a decline, they can't afford to start a new project from scratch.
---
What is it now you want? Even if they use the exidting parts, this would be a huge project and they don't have enough ressources right now to fix stuff.
---
... which does tell me that when GW3 should be a thing, I'll stop playing ANets games. They tried with GW2 because of similar reasons you call out a GW3. This shows me and maybe others aswell that they didn't learn. How should GW3 be better than the two before in this setting?
---
What if they placed in the borderlands rotation? I liked the map, more than I like the desert bl.
---
There shouldn't be any announcement hype. T
---
It doesn't unless they change monetisation methods like having a sub, or charging individually for new maps as DLC's.
---
is your game fully downloaded yet (can see on the launcher)?
---
"made gw2 one of the biggest mmos"
---
It made GW2 one of the biggest MMORPG's in terms of population or popularity. GW2 isn't even one of the biggest MMORPG's out of NCsofts games alone.
---
One whale is worth hundreds, if not thousands, of avg players.
---
One whale might throw like 500$ to game while avg player spends 0.99$ *only in dire need*.
---
The difference is 99% cosmetic: the 1% left is functional when you have too many tag of a type and colors are not enough to tell them all apart, but this is pretty rare with all the colors available (not sure how it fares for color blind people though).
---
I haven't seen any tag being taken more or less seriously in a while, for most people a tag is a tag so pick the one you like the most. Note that if you save up an additional 150g (iirc) later on you can still get the tag you didn't pick at first and end up with both shapes available.
---
So if i don't want to wait around for events to spawn or craft items that take 250 planks of wood, I've got a middle of the road fantasy story that ends in one sitting and checklist achievements for a different looking pair of wings to put on my back. 
---
I've never understood the notion that you're forced to grind over and over in WoW, because if you spend the time doing everything at least once, you're just naturally getting the gear to see all the content and do higher difficulties.
---
Okay, of course you're not gonna be able to jump straight into the last boss of the new raid in Mythic, the same way you can't just jump into 100 CM or Matthias with blues and greens and 0 AR. Except in WoW, you don't have to farm some random event in some random zone over and over to get 200 Ingots of Masculinity  to buy the gear with the right stats to fight the last boss in Uldir. You just go into Uldir and get your gear while you're learning the fights.
---
how does me quitting the game because i have nothing to do help raising gw2 earning?
---
Oh I didn't know about these items. Thanks a lot. Just a side note: how are you so comfortable with karma!!!!
---
No difference, nope. People generally don't care if it's OG pin or cat, go with whatever your heart desires :) 
---
I think if we only had DS maps it'd be bad, but that DS exists is awesome and was sorely needed. DS is one of the best examples of how the events system can make for a great group experience.
---
I am pretty sure Kralkatorik is done for already. I doubt they try to cook up even more epic battle against him on the next episode. And just prolonging the Kralky storyline even more will just stall the storydevelopment so bad that there is no reason for it.
---
My theory is that Aurene needed to be written of the story anyway, a dragon posessing Kralkatoriks magic is just too strong of an ally. They can't really just kill her off either, not yet atleast. So how do you achieve this? We were given a reminder of the magics Kralky possesses, Zhaitan, Mordremoth and Balthazar. So I suspect the "impossible" task Glint told Aurene about was to win a fight against Kralkatorik yet make everyone believe she lost and died - to make her escape/disappearance possible. This she did by planting a vision of defeat and her death to everyones minds with mordremoth magic absorbed from Kralky. Then she re-animated kralks body "to just leave" for the others who were outside the main battle with Zhaitan magic. Followed by her leaving/disappearing in to the mists with Balthazar magic, where she will be hiding until she is needed again.
---
In next chapter we chase Kralk to his "origin" point in the bloodlegion home lands, expecting a major fight but instead we find a dead kralks body - commander has a "wait a minute" moment, we rush back to Aurenes body to find nothing there. Kralk is killed, Aurene is alive - plot problems solved and we are left with a relief of Aurene being alive but we don't know where she is.
---
i havent made it yet, but i know my next character is going to be a greatsword charr berserker with citadel runes; so i can use the steam chainsaw sword (recent one, not halloween) and headbutt things to summon artillery strikes on them
---
Thought the funny thing is most of those aren't "MMO", only WvW is actually 'massively multiplayer', PvP/fractals/raids are simply 'multiplayer/co-op' and what is more they are all instanced off away from the supposed persistent world which is supposed to be the basis of an MMORPG.
---
This reminds me of the time they needed to DOWNGRADE zhaitan, as the fight was too hard for the player base. Vanila players know the pain hahahaha
---
Would recognize that art style anywhere, its @jacketbear on twitter (a whole lot of nsfw stuff there)
---
[link](https://twitter.com/jacketbear/status/1057877533855703040) to sketch
---
no it doesnt
---
SW is better than DS in the sense that if you don't want to do the meta you're not map restricted, tho. DS has some nice events post meta and the map is fun to explore, but it being meta gated means that I never go there just to run around and have fun. 
---
FF also has a subscription fee which is why I only played a couple months then never went back personally. 
---
You used to be able to level alts up there relatively quickly and it was a good place to grind WvW rank/karma before the nerfs, but unfortunately there's pretty much nothing left these days.
---
People speculated that the reason for killing it off was to try and entice people to play on the actual borderlands because at the time, EotM was more rewarding.
---
It's sad. What's left amounts to wasted development time, essentially. 
---
I bet 1g they will permanently remove the downstate.
---
ppl crying that the game is doing bad when it's doing pretty well compared to previous years given the lack of an xpac
---
&gt;  tomorrow they will be announcing 
---
they never said that. they said next week. not next tuesday. we have gotten blog posts and announcements on thursdays/fridays before.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_gameplay
---
It was heavily implied (maybe confirmed idk) that Selbubb was what drove the quaggan, krait and largos toward the surface.
---
**Cooperative gameplay**
---
Cooperative gameplay (often abbreviated as co-op) is a feature in video games that allows players to work together as teammates, usually against one or more AI opponents.  It is distinct from other multiplayer modes, such as competitive multiplayer modes like player versus player or deathmatch. Playing simultaneously allows players to assist one another in many ways: passing weapons or items, healing, providing covering fire in a firefight, and performing cooperative maneuvers such as boosting a teammate up and over obstacles.
---
In its most simple form, cooperative gameplay modifies the single player mode of a game,  allowing additional players, and increasing the difficulty level to compensate for the additional players.

Mesmer main here. It all depens on your fighting style.
---
Even so metabattle is existing because dps matters much more in the game, you need to utilize what you can and how you use the class system of the mesmer.
---
Look into the weapons and their behaviour when you start to decide - then you can choose the other parts: skills, traits and such.
---
It is f.e. possible to use power mirage, which will be very visual because of the greatsword-ambush visualisation.
---
This can be a problem when stealth and not dominant play style in bigger groups / zergs is helpful to not be on the enemies radar. Anyway, it differs when you can utilize the mirage system... or choose Sword.
---
Focus and sword would be in cc style, so be aware that a huge amount of stability would be your biggest enemy.
---
At the same time, if ranged classes kills you too fast, traits-supported focus reflect and reflect in general could be a friend.
---
There are many possibilities and depense of if you can play what you choose and counter others with it. You need to choose your fights.
---
Other than that, some wvw servers got wvw builds for zergs, which will be focussed on the help of your team whike doing your role in the zerg. At least for my server, there is no use for mesmer so bear that in mind.
---
Have fun out there and don't let the hate get you.
---
you can choose diviners from ls3 map-trinkets? arent they only hot-stats?
---
Devs confirmed it and Varorson bashed this topic over and over on reddit and the forums, but some people still don't get it: 
---
The entity named Mouth of Mordremoth IS the Elder Dragon (or specifically his physical body). End of topic.
---
I have really been playing since HoT so the times when I was short on Karma are long behind me. I don't have a lot of Karma sinks outside of LS3/4 heart vendors currently.
---
I also did a big year of frequent WvW that helped a bit with it.
---
Finally Wintersday is the biggest source of Karma you ca have even if you don't farm it a lot. I did 1 round of bells, 3 times the JP and all the orphans most days with most karma boosters (less than 30 minutes) and I got roughly 2 million karma during the whole event. Most years I just keep afloat almost only thanks to Wintersday.
---
I didn't really think about QoL features in relation to this until you mentioned it, but now you have it is sort of astounding (at least to me ) that they not added some sort of build template system in 6 years. 
---
Doesn't matter either way, my original point is that neither the avatar within the dream or the Mouth look draconic in comparison to all other Elder Dragons.
---
Renegade is in a really good spot, doesn't need tweaks - don't see why F skills should also apply to its summon, what if you don't use Kalla as one of your Legendary Stances? You'd lose a lot form not using her.
---
* You can grant perma alacrity already
---
* You can grant perma might already
---
* Citadel Bombardment is already solid and can be traited to be more effective
---
Oh nicely done :D 
---
the map never resonated very well with actual wvwers. it already had some of the issues anet later also implemented into dbl. people often rather waited out their queue than join eotm, because it entirely failed its purpose, and now there rarely are enough queues in the first place to even consider eotm as an option.
---
if rewards were to be brought up again, including pips, i'd worry about the remaining wvw population. even at a reduced rate the effort/reward, considering the grand majority would treat it as a pve farm map, would turn actual wvw into laughingstock - why play wvw when you can farm its exclusive rewards with pve.
---
permanent portable provisioner is a feature long forgotten by the devs, and only really useful for the big spender daily. it hasn't been updated in ages, lacks a ton of food variants, there is close to zero reason to purchase blueprints through it, and it utterly lacks functionality as ticket or wvw laurel vendor. hence wvw related vendors still need to be accessed directly.
---
The lack of HoT-like meta events starting with Season 3 is really upsetting. We had endgame taking place in the open-world, how awesome is that!? Now we have maps that just die out once the new episode comes around :/
---
Technically, diviner's are hot stats, but were only avaible in pvp the recent implementation in pve.
---
Yeah Chronos would obviously be a chronomancer if I made him but I wanted to focus on the olympians first - wanted to give Hera a supportive role - with reflect bubbles, teleportation, alacrity and all, she brings lots of utility to a team - she's the least 'similar' character vs profession I have, unfortunately.
---
&gt;Mellagan was confirmed by the devs to be an aspect of Melandru, so nope.
---
[Citation needed]
---
even at reduced rate, people would farm it as a pve experience, completely invalidating any rewards actual wvw gives. pips cannot be the solution, especially in the current state of wvw, where any loss of population could prove to be fatal.
---
A new expansion would work too, but both HoT and PoF have been very underwhelming for what other MMOs (even GW1) had to offer. Also, GW3 would be better because it would garner more attention than any expansion, and we really lost a lot of people over the years, specially after release, due to a bad first impression.
---
My ideal GW3 would be pretty much GW2, but separate, so everyone gets a fresh start. Everything achieved in GW2 (specially the QoL) would be there at release, and be used from the very first minute (collections, masteries, mounts, etc). The biggest change would be the world, we would get complete new zones and maps, and keep nothing of the old, or just pieces of it here and there. New story too.
---
But yeah, I definitely prefer expansions to LW. I would even prefer if we got less LW and more frequent expansions, as long as those expansions have enough content, built to last for months. Waiting 3 months for 10~ hours of content (I'm being generous) is far worse than waiting a year for, say, 100h of content.
---
Another good thing about expansions is that the whole story is longer, and planned from beginning to end. The LW feels more spontaneous and random in some things, and the plot suffers way more.
---
Also, I would adapt WoW's model regarding expansion+patches. We get the big expansion, but we don't get to fight the villain. Then we get 2-4 patches where we wrap up the expansion's storyline, before moving into the next expansion. Always felt pretty lame to finish villains so quick here anyway.
---
If you want an example of what I would consider a solid expansion, check my Canthan expansion idea: [The Celestial Tournament](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Lon-ami/Cantha).
---
This seems to be identical in features to the Trilogy + EotN I bought on Steam.
---
It is possible to do without. But it is better done with the expansions because it offer you so much more. And especially when it comes to PvP and WvW, it makes a huge difference. 
---
Imagine full body Kralkatorrik flying above the map and blocking out the sun.
---
Just revert it back so it doesnt have reward tracks and you get xp from capturing stuff again.
---
Dry Top and Silverwastes maps are part of Living Story Season 2. These events happened before HoT, so they are free to visit to all player, whether they have the HoT expansions or not.
---
Enjoy the farmig :)
---
bcs she told customer to FUCK OFF? even SJW protection has limits.
---
maybe you can explain why were school uniforms removed from the game,why bikiny which are in game,still are NOT available for players,why there wasnt single sexy armor piece in game for last 3 years or why  there isnt single sexy outfit in last  3 years. waiting for your answer =))
---
I hope it is removing links, merge servers, add tornaments. Would be totally possible and the tek already exist.
---
I feel like you don't completely understand the terminology behind "respect my time" it means not that the game gives you everything by your wish, it means that the game doesn't FORCE you to do something you don't want and wasting your time on purpose, you CAN waste some time on getting that skin you want, but it's never required to see all the content in the game, you're getting yourself cheap exotics and you're golden, everything else is up to you. If you don't want to wait around for the events to spawn, then you're playing the wrong game. If you want to game be centered on yourself then just play some single player game, complaining about waiting for the events is like complaining for waiting for a group in lfg or raid, or that someone killed your quest mob, you're playing an mmo, you're not alone in this world and events were purposely created to emphasize it. There's a minimum ilvl threshold in lfr in wow, so you still have to grind yourself both equip and azerite through the world quests, for example, the highest ilvl you can get yourself from the Uldir's lfr is 340, Battle of Dazar'alor requires minimum of 370 to being able to play it through the lfr. Yeah, in wow you don't grind materials to buy some piece of gear you need, instead you grind some random gear which can be useless to you and every 2-3 months blizzard makes all your hard work obsolete with an increased ilvl cap.
---
In terms of keeping old systems relevant, I do think that Masteries are a good example of that. But again, after I‚Äôve explored all the maps and chanelled my last mastery point. Now what? Go back to SW, go back to the same daily fractals. I need content to support the systems.
---
And in terms of content like maps and instances, I don‚Äôt mind outdated old content if there‚Äôs just as much new content to replace it. I really don‚Äôt understand the appeal of making me do old content to get new stuff. I‚Äôve done Arah a million times by 2014. I don‚Äôt wanna keep redoing it forever. I don‚Äôt wanna wait 15 min to spawn the champ spider in Kessex Hills to get a new mount. Add new rewards, add new content to go with it.
---
Are people really this dense...
---
At least last year they started doing sales again, I bought the trilogy + EotN (basically this pack) for less than ¬£18 in June.
---
what? I'm so confused GW2 raids has nothing to do with servers and resets every week. What are you even talking about?
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Raid](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Raid)
---
Yeah, I agree that more frequent expansions would be better for the game as opposed to more LW, since expansions are better for profitability and player retention, as well as having less constraints.
---
I don't think we'll ever see GW3 though, but if we do, I'd expect a game that's much smaller in scope. One of the main reasons GW2 doesn't get the level of support it deserves is because it's basically 5 games in 1, leading the devs to spread their resources thin across the various facets of the game (and eventually shifting those resources to where the metrics tell them).
---
No one every played EotM before. It was rejected by WvW players because it is a freaking PvE map and abused by PvE players to farm or level up. Now it is people gathering and guilds trying to GvG in the area they got for it and hoping there wont be griefers around.
---
Don't see how this ever will change 
---
Time for an expansion!
---
The map is just awful, sorry.
---
Wait for a sale, they started doing them last year again (after 4 years of no sales). I bought the trilogy + EotN (basically this pack) for less than ¬£18 in June.
---
Zhaitan is a decrepit mass of snakey tentacle things that make up the rough shape of a dragon. Kralky is a giant hulking behemoth with a hammerhead, not the classic dragon head shape. And we haven‚Äôt seen anything other than the heads of Jormag and Primordus, and no Bubbles at all. And Mordy‚Äôs head (just the head) still looked dragonesque, so I‚Äôd argue that none of the Elder Dragons have a specific form similar to the others, they‚Äôre all different. 
---
The avatar was a bit of a mess though, true.
---
Not too Surprising, it was only out for about 1 month in Q3 2012 on release so big number right after release is not that weird.
---
and then it went down surrounding scarlet, until Late 2013 when it bumped up a bit probably due to Shit starting to go down until eventually battle for lion's arch happened in early 2014.
---
then went up With Heart of Thorns and after, went down until Right before PoF Around when it was announced.
---
after it then went up again further when PoF was released and is now going down, yet again. probably until next big thing happens.
---
*Woah!* It's your **2nd Cakeday** Aragorn2013! ^(hug)
---
Could have at least taken the screenshot from the front, you can barely see anything there but the mountainside 
---
Thats bs because slb dmg will tank super hard too if you dont have quickness and alacrity since you cant utilize your buffs fully and you attack slow as fuck. Try using maul hilt maul f3 4 5 without quickness which is most of your dmg. Pointing out a classes dps will tank because of no quick/alac is pointless because every class has this issue
---
i wish they would just revert the changes and make it so you can gain exp from it again, no reward tracks. thats all they need to do, it may not have been what they designed it for but the community made something work, now it's gone for no reason.
---
Even when gliders were announced, people made more compelling arguments against them. This is such a low effort post
---
if i were to put on my tinfoil hat, i'd say the decision might have been influenced by the introduction of level 80 exp boosts for 2000 gems :) 
---
One of the two most popular games of the last decade have shitty graphics, so yeah.
---
I don't think GW2 needs a substantial graphic update.
---
I would say that a FB/Ren composition is superior to a Druid/Chrono comp imo. FB/Ren feels a lot more active and allows more positioning mistakes because the main boons (alacrity/quickness) do not come from wells you need to stand in when they go off. And the damage output of said FB/Ren is higher than the Chrono one. Both are viable though, dont wanna talk someone out of playing Chrono/Druid.
---
eotm playerbase was mostly full of PVE players that came to level, the commanders were usually WvW players ( i dont know exactly why they were there) but there were usually a max of 2 commanders per side, occasionally some wvw rejects came to farm bags from the low levels but they were also in the minority, they just had better gear and better builds than level 20s 
---
Hype? I thought we were getting PTSD from golem week and desert bl release. 
---
They should make it so you get a fixed number of pips, like 4 or 5 wtv... the minimum you get on the main maps...  
---
And also make it the 3rd map of WvW. The design is just so good and so wasted if people don't play it  
---
&gt; A new game should have updated features.
---
Why? I would be fine if GW3 was everything GW2 at release. They can add the new features later on, or hell, focus on expanding the existing features, instead of adding more and more crap that leads nowhere.
---
I refuse to believe that Arena Net is not working on a new expansion, just because of the phrasing of one question. Mike Z is a games director, not a marketing specialist. Yes they are asked to present their game to the public via interviews and such, but we can't expect them to correct every single word the interviewer asks them. The main information he wanted to bring out there was, that Season 5 will start directly after Season 4.
---
And then there is the fact, that interviews are way more dynamic conversations as the articles or video summaries we get in the end might suggest. And it happened before that an interviewer asked a question phrased differently than the question that was printed in the final article.
---
But all of this doesn't matter, since we have no direct information on either or not there will be another expansion. Except these assumptions some people read out of an interview we have no way to proof if or how it was altered. 
---
This will be a rather short reply but my gf used to be a heavy LoL player as well. I spent ages trying to get her into the game, she liked it for the first week or so nicely but her interest died down after that (especially wvw related). Then I took her to wvw and she's been living there ever since :p 
---
Perhaps the pve side of the game isn't for you after spending ages with a game like league? My gf said she hated knowing what was coming next and repeating the same thing. So yea, try out some of the other stuff at lvl 80 (yea there's a bit of a grind to lvl 80 but just go at Ur own pace and use the personal story etc). Game modes like PvP u can almost jump right into, whilst others do need lvl with exotic or higher gear.
---
PvE players do not go there anymore because the farm was removed. WvW players never went there except some guilds who done GvG and now more so at the GvG spot that was added. 
---
It is a WvW map or was suppose to be one and exp was removed from WvW long time ago so ofc it was also removed in EotM. And it might be that you and your friend are there and have a blast then  good for you and you should keep on doing it because that is why we play games to have fun, but there is a reason it is not played by WvW player now nor was it when it came out. I mean i am not even sure why you trying to say otherwise. 
---
And just to be clear i do not call farming ranks by capture a worm or take a keep that was taken by the enemies 10 min ago and their cattas are still up and so are ours because noone cares, is not WvW. 
---
At least Planty K Rool had a more than just awsome battletheme
---
eh, why do you include PoF in the season 4 era, but HoT (and the 2 following quarters) not in the season 3 era?
---
I know season 3 started later, but HoT wasnt season 2 era.
---
There are so many mistakes done with GW2, and so many great things that weren't brought from GW1, that you don't even need a GW3 announcement to understand that many people would love a GW3 announcement.
---
It would be everything GW2 is now, at release.
---
GW2 was a mess at 2012, causing such a bad impression on some people that still today, 7 years later, there's a general belief that this is a dead game.
---
Like the comic book character, I throw rocks (Ventari Tablets.) and knock people around. 
---
what a dumb fucking comment 
---
Yeah it's dead .. I miss playing there. Zerk vs Zerk .. leveling twinks, farm for Hero points.
---
...which was kind of the whole point. Glad you figured that out.
---
I agree, I do think there is more appeal in making the Elder Dragons look very different from each other. If they follow through on the changes they made to Kralk, he may end up a dragon similar to Aurene (the neck is starting to show similarities and there is a concept render showing his wing) while Primordus could look more like a massive drake or crocodile. 
---
Bubbles I would like to picture as some sort of deep sea horror, big blind eyes, massive fins, very serpentine. That sort of thing. 
---
Jormag could be anything. We have the Norn intro cutscene, which isn't necessarily accurate, and we have a tooth. 
---
 
---
&gt;players who come in later, have to pay about 140g only for the sigils to get the new armor and the early players got it way way cheaper?
---
lmao they were 20-13g for the first week and steadily 8g until anet introduced the sigil crafting rework
---
This is utterly awesome!!!
---
That's amazing!!
---
I love to see "unusual" combos in drawings, like a Char Elementalist, as I have in game a Char ele, necro and mesmer!
---
I think they are pretty cool and your drawing makes me love them even more!
---
I am a data analyst in one of these 100 - 1000 ppl companies and I need to agree, as much as I hate to do so...
---
More often than not, Management sees only the current situation. With no background on what the shift of focus would mean for other areas of the company. And to be honest, they don't care. Better start throwing around fancy buzzwords like "digital" and "AI" and talk about how good of an manager you are for finding the new "business opportunities". And when they start to realize that the company has not enough manpower to support the new focus plus the old business, they most likely get a new job within months and leave a big pile of shit behind.
---
I seriously stopped counting the meetings where I asked them to not do anything without thinking about the consequences... Yes numbers can show you where your might have a potential market... But you also need to look at the resources you have to work with to make this new opportunity happen. And this is where most companies/managers fail. And then it comes down to who screams the loudest...
---
Interesting. So you lack the sense of perspective. I'm guessing you're blind of one eye?
---
Never occurred to me how it could impact perspective in a 2d image with depth
---
(Yes. Most are "innies")
---
Honestly, the reason it's like this is because of ANET's refusal to take Edge of the Mists seriously. There is no incentive for actually winning, since it doesn't contribute in any major way to the Mist war. The rewards are also toned down significantly, and no pips.
---
It's so sad because I personally think Edge of the Mists offers a playstyle that is very different from other maps and fills a niche that they are missing with its smaller chokepoints and unique structure.
---
Could any of the wvw "tryhards" explain to me why EoTM couldn't be converted to a normal map and simply fine tuned in its weaker points?
---
You can't talk optimization without talking about what you're actually optimizing, which is graphics rendering primarily.
---
The game is perfectly playable as it is now. Updated would be welcomed, but they're far from a priority.
---
&gt;I can't remember why I quit 4 years ago
---
There was no mounts, no gliding, no specializations, no fractals, and no new content. It feels like a full game now.
---
You after wow introduced upright orcs I was amazed! But now, I want upright charr!!!! More than anything!!
---
&gt;WvW players can go to when all borderlands are queued. Besides, there are vendors etc that players might need
---
This is now fulfilled entirely by Obsidian Sanctum.
---
I'm an alien.
---
It's a completely different market, like movies vs books. Hope they aren't dumb enough as to pull a Diablo: Immortal.
---
I feel the opposite, they just gave underwater combat some quick fixed here and there to forget about it for a few years.
---
Can't blame them, there's far too many more important things anyway.
---
9-11 was an inside job. 
---
My G600 paid off for doing that achieve lol.
---
I quit GW2 a few years ago because I felt like I ran out of stuff to do (A bit less than 3k hours played).
---
I got real high in fractals, crafted a Legendary on my own, did some Guild Quests, 100% the map twice. Now the only content I can see myself coming back for is raids and it doesn't seem worth getting back into the game and learning my class now that it has elite specs when I could just try a completely new MMO (though those are in quite the shortage).
---
I'm not interested in the story at all, don't care about LS much. I'm more of a show don't tell guy. I like breathing worlds with lore that you can bath in (like Souls games). GW2 DOES have this, but mostly in nostalgia winks at GW1, which tbh right now is more fun to me than GW2.
---
Oh, I play an Inquest themed Asura mesmer, basic stuff but I love it: Inquest Exo-Suit, all Inquest Mark II weapons (for both Chronomancer and Mirage builds), Dynamics Projector Module glider, and Exo-Suit mounts!  
---
And to complete the asura look, of course, Job-r-Tron gathering tools and Golem Pummeler finisher.  
---
Name is Zmodd and I use 'The Archdesigner' title.  
---
^(I think I'm actually retarded...)
---
The only events post-meta are group events and treasure mushroom though, and the only parts of the map restricted to the meta are the Blighting Towers and Dragon's Domain - little different than the Vinewrath's and Labyrinth areas being restricted to meta.
---
PoF lasted only a month for me, but cmon. Mounts were huge enough to make PoF transcend what an LS episode is. 
---
Those deep undersea tendrils that rippled through the darkness and scared Quaggans? They just wanted to hug them and play with them.
---
Ever heard about sarcasm? :D
---
Nah, you can't use them in that instance, sadly.
---
Be realistic. Probably no more expansions but a season or two of LW then maintenance mode. They havent produced anything positive in the past few years (besides new unfinished maps, 10h of content in PoF). PvP and WvW completely left behind, PvE endgame scene is slowly degrading (unfinished maps, longer periods between raid and fotm releases).
---
But hey as long as we have those cringy anet streams. 
---
A good dragon wouldn't have forced the quaggans out of their home.
---
Or, technically, the krait and karka, or be battling the largos.
---
Maybe that something massive is GW3? Maybe they plan to release it next year some time and a new expansion is too close to the release (don't want to release an expansion and 6-9months later a whole new game)?
---
Living world has smaller releases so it might also give them a bit more flexibility with timing and resources. As the release of GW3 nears and each LW team finishes up they can move to working on GW3. Or maybe they will continue LW with GW3?
---
I‚Äôve been saying this the past few days. Why not just make an episodic single player narrative game when that‚Äôs where all their resources are going anyway.
---
It has been confirmed, yes.
---
I second this, though it's not really "annoying" as much as potentially dangerous.
---
As someone who's at risk of developing CTS and similar conditions, I firmly believe that no game should do this sort of achievements if they are timegated. If it was something you could finish long-term outside of the festival (like festive imbiber, even before the "consume all" thing) it would have been a different story, but this pretty much forces anyone who wants APs to either break the ToS with a macro or do the same thing 1500 times in a row (even when using all the fireworks I dropped in the past 3 weeks I barely managed to get past the first round of the achievement). That's bad/careless design, sadly.
---
I started GW1 during the post-HoT content drought, and I had more fun there than here. There's so many things to do, and they feel much more rewarding. It's sad how they got rewards so wrong in GW2 when GW1 did such a great job at it.
---
I even made an expanded [HoM to 80](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/User:Lon-ami/Hall_of_Monuments) to track completion even further, and still log in now and then to finish the few things I have left.
---
A very good magic cat! Far too few elementalist Charr out there!
---
Like I said, the only thing that is bothering me is the fact that you actively have to press a weapon skill to activate the firework, if they would streamline the fireworks with the firecrackers then you could just spam the fireworks and you would be good.
---
But, again, I did the achievement three times this morning.
---
I also didn't argue against your point though, it could be better for sure but this is hardly anything that annoying.
---
Yes, i was wrong about ilvl 370, yet still, to have a full set of 350 gear you should complete dungeons and raids more than once, and even more if you're aiming for mythic dungeons, so to get yourself items from the first try, you should wait up until the new ilvl cap and only then do the old content. :/
---
Please insert the plot point into spoilers. I understand your point but what I was talking about was more related to the fact that Episode 5 is more marketable to new players because a lot of press can get involved. I love Istan, for example, and I do think Episode 1 is how episodes should be done, but that doesn't mean that a farming event is a selling point. Overall, the general quality has increased in the Living World and that's what matters to the veteran player to keep retention ( obviously replayable map content is the most important goal ).
---
Same deal with [southsun](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Southsun_Cove) which was added in season 1 and is therefore in the base game.
---
&gt; It's sad. What's left amounts to wasted development time, essentially.
---
Just like with dungeons. So many dead zones and entire dead game modes.
---
Oh wow, I didn't think of that.
---
Now it's my #1 favorite theory! Dang, that would be sooooo cool!
---
Also totaly impractical
---
It won't. People in this reddit are too biased towards what they want and what is good for business.
---
I've played the free trial so I have experience with how the game's class system works. A new class should be equivalent to a new elite spec,except that any character can use it. That seems pretty big to me.
---
FFXIV is also a PvE-driven game. Its PvP was always an afterthought. Meanwhile, GW2 tried to appeal to three different game modes, and for years its balance patches have favored some at the cost of others, only for that to be in vain because WvW and PvP ended up dead and unsupported anyways. Last I know, FFXIV never had years of pvp balance screwing pve players, so it's a non-issue.
---
I agree. As much as I love the group content in FFXIV (dungeons and raids) but the leveling process with quests is a pain. The moment I ding max. level in each expansion, I just complete the Main Story Quests and sidequests for feature and dungeon unlocks.
---
I rather spend days in deep dungeons to level other classes, than picking up leftover quests. For people who don't know what I mean: Deep dungeons are a set of 10 floors of the same environment filled with enemies. You need to kill a certain amount of enemies to unlock the teleporter to the next floor and you get rewarded millions of EXP after the 10th floor. So yes... I rather stupidly farm the same 10 floors of deep dungeon for hours before picking up one of these stupid kill quests.
---
Is this sales of the game including or micro transactions or not?
---
&gt; You could argue GW2 also gives two group driven content every patch (open world metas and raid or fractal)
---
We get one new raid/wing (3 bosses tops) once a year and two fractals that are 10 minutes long twice a year.
---
Those achievements are not meant to be done directly but over time. That I did it because I wanted to was my own choice and not something the game forced me to.
---
Slomo my fucking man
---
Is there also an easy way to get mastery points? I have 19 and did the fast math and need 34 to unlock all the masteries for finishing my Tempest collection.
---
That is Dry Top over the oasis, but its confusing for me to use screenshots so I'll just watch from afar and let someone else win (:
---
&gt; A new class should be equivalent to a new elite spec, except it's available to any character. That seems pretty big to me.
---
Once again, don't talk as you know it, when you don't. Go do some research on the Blue Mage class and then talk about. 
---
Here's a resume, Blue Mage is a class that only goes to level 50, it uses recycled mob skills and it can only be used in certain game modes up to level 50, these game modes are very rarely done with level 50s since it's slow so the only thing a Blue Mage will be used for is: Do the game modes to obtain skills, play on tiered arena with mobs specifically made for Blue Mage to basically farm a few limited currency.
---
&gt;  WvW and PvP ended up dead and unsupported anyways.
---
Here's the thing, you talk about WvW as if it was dead but I normally tend to find a shitton of people there maybe they are NPCs or maybe your just saying things out of your ass, while it's true it's been neglected for a while now it's most definitely not dead.
---
Question: We've seen "negative" things about the water dragon, driving various species out of their natural range, but I can't remember if we've seen anything about it actively being nasty. In other words, is it possible that the negative impacts on the quaggans, krait, etc. could have been an unintentional result of the water dragon just waking up? Something like Rip Van Winkle waking up and knocking the bird nest out of his beard.
---
Hi, I am a Anet employee and I made several thousand bot accounts. We monitor this sub 24/7 and will down vote anything that makes us look bad.
---
Crack is bad.
---
So the actions of two slaves define the proper fate for a species?
---
-shrug-
---
Pro tip: you don't have to do the whole achievement in 5 minutes...
---
You had 3 weeks to do it, enough time to use some fireworks every now and then. 
---
If you want to fore all 1500 fireworks in row, I think it's your own fault. There were/are enough ways to do in convinient.
---
The game came out, but the sales were split between two quarters due to timing.
---
what's a 1d waifu for a 2d alien ? 
---
&gt; The problem is we don't have any prestigious skins, due in big part to the lack of long-term progression systems
---
&gt; Also, some skin types are pretty much gem store exclusives, gliders and mounts being the biggest offenders.
---
I started Ad Infinitum because it was one of the few glider skins that can be earned in-game.  It's also one of the few backpacks that doesn't clip with long hair.  I started work on the PVP glider but hung it up as I dislike PVP and realized I'd gotten what I'd wanted with one of the earlier tier backpack skins.
---
Agreed on mount skins, though - the fact there *isn't* a set that features a big involved collection feels like a glaring omission at this point.
---
Content I can buy doesn't interest me.  Content I can play for *does*.
---
In my opinion Verdant Brink, Auric Basin and Tangled Depths are meta-focused maps and surely we also need those in the game, while they've gone with Dragon Stand too far. Making a map that is a huge meta so either you must to participate and success in events or you cannot see it's full potential was so wrong. Entering this map just to quickly explore before timer runs out and you die is not comfortable. It's so frustrating and nervy. I also hated locking some areas behind events.   
---
Sometimes I think like devs completely don't think about population of people on the map that lowers with time  and when everybody is having fun in the new content and it's not helping new players in any way to complete their achievements.   
---
Maps in Crystal Desert are better, because on the other hand you do what you want to do and there's no pressure at all which is so relaxing, I like the ideas of Bounty Hunting and medium metas like the Casino Blitz in Crystal Oasis, Jundudu Assault or The Mouth of Torment in Desolation, Serpent's Ire in Vabbi and for some reason I feel like that's more enjoyable way.    
---
I hope there's a common ground between HoT style and PoF style and that they will be experimenting with it.   
---
I gave up on this story step on my main - Mesmer - for around a year. Checked Youtube guides, Reddit, Builds etc. Failed everytime. Then I decided to go in with a Scourge, and it was easy, beacuse the minions take the agro, and I could better control what was going on.
---
1st part - focus on Garm (if you chose Braham) until he's dead, then, when Eir is rezzing him, focus CC to break her bar, and do as much damage as possible. This part is annoying because you have to dodge Garm, and Eir's ranged attacks, which can be overwhelming.
---
2nd part - if you chose Canach, it's basically CC until bar breaks, damage after, and dodging his bombs.
---
3rd -  Modremoth comes in, this is easier at close range just dodging his swipe attack.
---
4th - he starts spawning the Corrupted versions of your friends. Focus damage on them, until it's possible to open the rifts, and pay attention to the grounds attacks from Mordremoth (like the mordrem sniper line attacks, but in blue/white).
---
Alternating with the above, comes the phase where the ground break, and you have 3 options: glide, get on the tree, or get under Braham's shield dome - I prefer this last option, as you can still attack Mordry from under the dome.
---
5th - he spawns a bunch of minions, and you have to kill them while your tem opens the rifts. Once the rift is open, focus damage on Mordry until dead.
---
After succeeding on the Necro, I switched the build from Chrono to Mirage on the Mesmer, and chose skills with hard Cc (mostly signets), and went in, and did it on the first try.
---
It's just a reaaaaallly long fight, with a lot of different phases and mechanics.
---
It's not greed. We aren't talking about gold here, be serious. We are talking about completionism. Achievement hunters have to deal with shitty unfun achievements very often. I am just asking for something better than "do this shit 1300 times". The devs can do better than that.
---
&gt; But one title carrying the burden of everyone's happiness isn't reasonable.
---
I don't know how we got here but we have; a lot of folks seem to play fewer games but make much larger investments in them.
---
No, that would mean we have to take the Renegade legend.
---
You're the first one I've seen complaining about it.
---
Really nice idea but... Anet please add an amalgamated gemstone as an end reward of this potential futur meta !
---
I‚Äôll do it daily if they do so 
---
that :
---
------------
---
Giving swiftness-equivalent speed would level the playing field for many classes that have limited swiftness access. So they don't have to swap utilities or weapons to get back.
---
Giving more speed than swiftness would give defenders an advantage, and reduce the importance of EWPs.
---
unless ANET reshuffled the map territories so that sentries get their own 'zones' so reinforcements can be slowed down by capping the sentries (think capping the north ruins on alpine to prevent gliding from garrison)
---
Most fun I ever had in wvw honestly. They ruined power berserker
---
&gt; unless ele has a high functioning, meta veteran druid
---
Druid hasn't been used in good groups for quite some time, and weaver was and is still meta without them.
---
uuuu sexy
---
1. Quaggans have free will. Dragon minions don't.
---
2. Quaggans don't consume magic, dragon minions do.
---
3. Quaggans aren't tentacled, the DSD's minions are.
---
4. Melaggan is stated to be dead, the DSD isn't. Melaggan is also potentially the same as Melandru (in which case, "she is dead" by quaggan is just presumed because lack of contact caused by Melandru leaving).
---
5. The DSD forced the quaggan out of their home, its minions are enemies of the quaggans.
---
6. The DSD may not have threatened Central Tyria, but it has threatened those local to the Unending Ocean's depths: quaggan, krait, karka, and largos. Supposedly it has also prevented naval communication and trade between Cantha and Central Tyria.
---
7. Your theory presumes the DSD is still sleeping. It isn't. It was the second to wake up, after Primordus and before Jormag.
---
As written before, understandable perspective but I don't know if I got the energy to get another fresh game and wait what they do to see if they finally learned - you need a good amount of time for a truthful check.
---
Evens o the way you wrote contains a learning curve, many other aspects shows that it's lacking any really solution or just a concept of that.
---
The market design and resources management for example are really lacking, because of the bottleneck design with gold. The crafting were in a very long time down to nothing for any ingame / game related system but an exchange clone habit. Just with the latest attempt there is hope.
---
Also like other comments wrote, the management of events here is not very healthy.
---
From my perspective, you could change the resource management and the lack of content on maps (therefore fewer players on the different maps) if you chain both together: focussed resource drops like ht leather farm, but way more advanced and spread through the maps. This way, you can farm specific materials for crafting goals and are less dependent on gold, yet at the same time the farming map problematic would be spread through all maps (=not focussed on just one and thinned the players on one map) and this would give more short time goals for the whole player base.
---
This is just one idea of how this could work, not better than any others. I just don't see that Anet will do anything to signal that they recognized and learned from the mistakes in both games, yet alone that they communicate properly to the community.
---
Taylor Swift
---
Pro tip:  Opening the festival bags is more effective doing it all at once at the  last day, while maximizing you magic find in the silverwastes. There you  get many fireworks and buy the rest that you need. You have no way of  knowing what you need before that.  
---
I already replied that to another comment. You are the third who commented the same thing.
---
No, it's the community that circlejerks in a fanatical manner. Watch this get down-voted because it's an unpopular opinion.
---
Viper is condi gear while both sword and gs are power weapons so it doesn't make much sense to use them for damage. It says gs is ok for farming since you don't need to do much damage to tag mobs and gs ambush is quite good long ranged aoe.
---
Isn't it a weird way to do it when you first learn about it?
---
But once you know, it makes so much sense.
---
Technically, it's never been confirmed that "dragon minions are immune to being corrupted by another dragon". This has always been pure player theory. Though Taimi does state she thought sylvari were immune due to being dragon minions, there are multiple counters to the theory:
---
1. Subject Alpha, Kudu's Monster, and more recently Subject Beta are all dragon minions corrupted by multiple dragon's power. And no, the Inquest are not capable of doing more than Elder Dragons with their corruption; the Inquest literally just made these minions by exposing test subjects to the Elder Dragons' corruptive magic and nothing more, as we see in CoE story.
---
2. During Season 2 and, more importantly, Heart of Thorns promotions, it was stated that the sylvari's immunity came from "protection from the Pale Tree", suggesting their immunity isn't due to their origins, but because of the Dream of Dreams. These bits also suggested that Soundless and, more interestingly, Malyck would not be immune. Furthermore, this connection to the Dream is why the Mordrem Guard are not enslaved to Mordremoth but [1. able to return to their old selves](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Solitary_Sylvari). 
---
3. Technically speaking, ever since Season 3 we've seen "dragon minions corrupted by the power of another dragon" ever since Primordus and later Jormag and Kralkatorrik took the power of another dragon and altered old/made new minions with such.
---
might have been nice to have some recipes introduced to craft firework batteries, that require 10 regular fireworks and also count as 10 fired, when using the battery.
---
For FFXIV I'll just say that one thing they do well is releasing content for both casual and hardcore players. They have their high-end raids and maybe the extreme trial if you count that as hardcore (milleage may vary). For casuals they have the normal mode raids, 24-man raids, dungeons, hunts, Relic Weapon (Legendary equivalent) grind.
---
They also release new skins, mounts, minis and sometimes housing items spread through all of these types of content. So, even if something is old and considered dead you can probably find some groups to farm these cosmetic items with enougn patience.
---
However, later we got told that's just human opinion, and that the quaggan proclaim Melaggan is dead. Killed by krait, no less.
---
I guess if I don't get an answer here I can start fishing around in other guilds or make a post... but does anybody know of a guild or commander that runs Serpents Ire or a regular schedule or even at request? 
---
I wanna get my gloves :P 
---
Just as a mod note: it is perfectly acceptable to share this application and discuss it, but please note we don't endorse it and are also not responsible for any repercussions you face for using it. Taking this thread down, however, is not something we'll do.
---
Thanks for the help. Sorry, I meant axe! Guess I need to just get better at melee. Although I still feel like theres always time I could be doing GS ranged damage where if I was just running axe+torch and pistol, I would just be doing nothing waiting to be able to get back in to melee range?
---
When is the last time we saw two LW releases released within 2 months? Season 3 Episodes 1 and 2? The average release cadence for season 4 has been much slower and there's no indication that it's going to change.
---
The thing is, Edge of the Mists was created as a waiting room to join WvW, when the servers were full, however now with the server emptiness in WvW, minus reset, there is basically no need for it these days, unfortunately.
---
&gt;Maybe, just maybe developers can think of fun achievements to do during festivals.
---
Firecracker Finder, Races, Adventure, Dragon Ball Arena were fun to me. That's roughly 2/3rd of the achievements there. For the rest, I used few firework every day up to the 60mn duration cap, part of daily routine and nice free bonus.
---
Not all of them need to be your kind of fun. If it's not fun to you, don't do it, doesn't mean it's dull for everyone.
---
Creating an event where there's Kralkatorrik with his full body is not only complicated but also cotly. In the interview they told that the latest story episode was the most expensive to create in the game history ever. Not speaking of crying computers of most of players.   
---
If they decide to create it though, I hope they won't go Dragon's Stand way, because that map in my opinion is the worst in the game and time consuming.  
---
It should be rather "We want to kill him? Okay we must do X to lure him out" not " We go, oh no we must kill X, we go, oh no we must kill Y, we go oh no we must kill Z, we go oh no it's huge XYZ and we have to kill it now and after that (which was longish) we enter the event to kill a dragon (which is also long)". Fingers crossed.   
---
Staff is much better option then. Mirage has lots of evades so melee range shouldn't me an issue in the first place.
---
Thank you for the official statement.
---
Hmm...some bosses in fractals and world maps even my health gets obliterated sometimes even with all the evades. Guess I need to git gud. Will look into staff. Thanks so much for the help
---
The whole "Elder Dragons are mindless forces of nature" is a case of an intentional unreliable narrator that Arenanet created. Though said NPC was a Zephyrite, that's the false perspective of Tyrians in general. It's shown in the Orr campaign (and far more so in HoT as well as the Edge of Destiny novel) that the Elder Dragons are very much intelligent and malicious.
---
I disagree with OP. And I also think OP you should learn how to give proper constructive criticism and feedback. Negative comments are very common but hey are always structured to make sense and have a point. They aren't written like 'wiufhiedgf hdfgb bleh, thats my opinion kbai'. Gotta justify it, keep your cool and support it :) No salt needed
---
Hammer core guard is a hard counter to several classes and does quite well in spvp.

Fairly new player here. How is this map different from others? 
---
It was made when we had stupidly long ques to get into wvw.  Anet fixed that problem by ignoring wvw for 6 years. Now it is not needed.

Which is why it's so amusing that their efforts are costing them profits.

g2a is not approved seller by the Lionguard and can lead to trouble if bought from. Just stick with the approved merchants so I don't have to come bail you out, recruit.

---
The latter half would be easy. Modify the same tech that does standard enemy models in PvP to be mandatory and swapping models into Branded variants.
---
They would need to create new models for branded norn, sylvari, and asura, unless all models are turned into charr/humans/awakened instead; turning everyone into branded awakened would be easiest due to model animations - branded female human and the tailless branded charr model used most in PoF have unique rigging from standard female human / charr models.
---
The hard part would be having Kralkatorrik included into the maps.
---
But as awesome as it really sounds, I doubt they'll do it for two reasons. First, mixing formats (Edge of the Mists was the closest they've ever gone to mixing WvW/PvP into the story). Second, timeline - what about after Kralkatorrik is dead? What about players who haven't gotten to the "Kralkatorrik is in the Mists" bit yet?
---
The later could be solved by having this be purely cosmetic and even optional, where players must complete a certain achievement to activate it, and Kralkatorrik never actually gets involved in the mechanics of WvW, but instead it's just a model change for standard enemy models.
---
I remember once there's a Guild that regularly run that Event every Sunday if i'm not mistaken. Thanks to their help i managed to finish the Sandswept Isles collection. Can't remember their name though.
---
It's an official post, by a dev. I don't know what to tell ya.
---
Yes! And some minor editing to give it an analogue effect.
---
Do you have a link or a source? Because I'm looking at the forums right now and don't see anything of the sort.
---
It's on the official forums under WVW. It's literally the most recent post and clearly marked "news , dev"
---
Only if you find some strange/unexpected behaivour in terms of performance. Better run normal build to find issues and troublehoot them over by performance log.
---
Todays changes is not critical at all.
---
Yea s4 achievements are so amazing when they work as the bloody should. I have killed the bloody ships and Iberu in Istan a million times and I just don't get the achievement.
---
Dry top is literally on a fixed rotation of events....
---
The Catmander tag doent give you anything better then the regular tag just the option to have a cat tag instead of the regular one, as far as I know Catmanders are pretty much treated the same as every other commander people generaly judge them more by their actions then their tags.

In the end it will probably be mounts in WvW with the same system like for gliding.

DLGamer is an official partner indeed, have you looked under "Digital Download" on Anet's retail list?

They're the only ones I know of that are both legit, and offer regular discounts.

Oh you mean how Hearthstone has been such a failure on mobile? People complain but I'm sure Diablo is going to rake in the cash.

actually no. i know tons of people that do not know there even is a search bar in the bank tab.

anyway, go figure, was sure it took tooltip info into consideration.
---
Destiny's Edge Too would have been a nice small addition for The Crystal Dragon. Seeing Braham leading his own small squad...
---
  
---
Just have random generic norn models named "Destiny's Edge" (quotations included).  
---
Thanks! And thanks for the heads up. 
---
Raiders say yes! If not these two there would be free loot each week!
---
Ur fun 
---
One of the main reasons we don‚Äôt see many canthans or travel to Cantha is because the DSD is making travel through the unending ocean treacherous. Even the Quaggan and Largos state the DSD is making life impossible. 
---
Season 3 and later do not count, as you have dragons wielding "multiple dragon powers" so to speak. Icebrood Quaggans are found in Frostgorge Sound, the map "dating" before even Zaithan's death where this is clearly not the case.
---
Regarding Subject Alpha, here's what we find:
---
"The side effect of being cross-corrupted was that Alpha not only gained abilities of different dragons' minions but also the power to bend any dragon minion under its will."
---
Icebrood Quaggan do not manifest the same abilities.
---
And why do you think Inquest aren't capable of doing more than the Elder Dragons? EDs are often compared to forces of nature. Is it so hard to imagine scientists inventing and creating something that doesn't occur naturally?
---
&gt; Can't win.
---
Whenever we get a third expansion you can bet people are going to complain bitterly about.... whatever.  They'll find something, they always do.
---
My favorite thing about HoT is no matter how much experience you have with the maps, some of the content is just flat-out multiplayer and can not be run solo.  It's multiplayer in a way PoF isn't, and dispenses loot that rewards coming back regularly.  It took me quite awhile to get all HoT collections completed, and I'm still short on AP - I've completed *one* of the four VB meta chains, and still have to do the rest one of these days.
---
Good point re roadmap. I love getting that from other developers, or even in different industries.
---
Leveled soo many characters there! I miss it. Always liked EotM mechanics, for example those generator camps and breakable bridges. Map itself is beautiful and quite versatile, it is like a mix of a WvW map and a PvP map.
---
As many have said here, some kind of re-purpose would be really nice. Maybe bring same rewards as normal WvW maps? Or make EotM as a 4th borderland? Maybe even replace EBG every second week with it? Or simply just make it generate more karma than anything else in the game.
---
I'm expecting they'll be more open about discussing the future after LS4 concludes with the next episode. Who knows what spoilers will come with that?
---
But once we know vaguely where LS5 will be set and this current part of the story is concluded, I think they'll be much more comfortable discussing things more openly. Just trying not to jump the gun by telling us too early.
---
This whole thing will probably be a big transition for everyone as ANet experiments with their new system. Will Living World exceed our expectations? Will that be enough to drive up sales or are expansions necessary selling points? If we're getting expansion content in Living World, will these new seasons be gated behind owning some previous expansion?
---
So many questions need to be answered, and I think they're just waiting until LS4 is done so they don't rob excitement from the last episode. But that communication needs to happen as we launch into this new thing.
---
i don't think anet really planned to take eotm seriously. the map it was a short term solution for the long queues. there were no grand plans for the map at all.  now if the map can be converted as a normal map well that depends. 
---
Expansion based on players nostalgia are the worst. 
---
It actually does.
---
See https://imgur.com/gallery/AU2KNPH
---
Not really. I think the company even before this was aware of this situation but has done not much to fix it because they either don't care or can't.
---
GW2 is a fast food MMO, it's fundamentally flawed. Its base design is full of good ideas, but the desitions that Anet has made just never let it reach its full potential, and not fixing them before has caused major issues now. The game is like brooming all the trash under the bed; if you do it once it will look like a clean room, do it enough and it will pile under and become a mess.
---
The way the game is designed is just making it a side MMO you can play and drop (thus a fast food MMO) without any sort of REAL content or replayability, masked by the playerbase as "play how you like" when it's evident this isn't the case.
---
Anet has already stated that there won't be a third expansion after this season, going directly to Season 5, and I really suspect they're using S5 as a finale to the game and announce GW3. GW2 just won't be able to compete with the AAA MMOs like FFXIV, ESO and WOW, all of which are in healthier states (maybe WOW not for long).
---
I recently started playing ESO and FFXIV and tho I can see how GW2 is miles better in the casual department, both MMOs blow it to bits in terms of content, quality of life, polish, and even new player experience (as convoluted FFXIV can be for its asian MMO tropes and systems, you actually end up being able to raid naturally because the game bothers teaching you what your class and roles do, for example).
---
Golem week was the best week ever! I wish it could come back.
---
But it does not need to be Golem week! It could be a portable siege week (mmmmm portable cannons), or a wall-less/gateless week, or a naked week, or even a week where everyone are allies!
---
Desert BL and EotM are really beautiful and fun maps! I wish my border could be red more often so DBL would have more players. One of the best features of DBL is defending keeps from massive amount of enemies, it is much more fun than defending keeps in Alpine maps.
---
The funny thing with Mordremoths Story mission appearance is, that we are in his mind. It can't possibly become any more personal than that. So was this the way how he sees himself? 
---
I would be anything I want to be, as long as I can think of it. Your own mind is after all the place where you can imagine to be a super hero/villain, the most powerful person alive or whatever. And he choose THAT?
---
likewise
---
WHAT'S THIS...?
---
No difference to now. If you want to play the new living story you have to buy the PoF expansion and in addition pay 200gems if you didn't login in time. Back then you had to buy the base game to play living story. I don't see how the new living story is free to play
---
The thing is: there's no middle ground here, you wither play ultra casual or ultra hardcore.
---
I'm playing FFXIV right now and I feel like I'm at home, I don't plan to go hardcore in the game but I've already had the chance to raid, I'm slowly working towards furniture for my apartment and completing all the job stories, plus filling hunting logs and exploring the world. It's only the vanilla game and sadly it has tons more to do than our MMO two expansions in.
---
GW2 failed to find a balance and add any singificant activities.

I agree, GW2 has become a glorified Tumblr blog or Instant Messenger, at this point it has more of avatar games like Gaia Online than actual MMO stuff and... that's sad.
---
So I‚Äôve been back to GW2 for about a month now. I‚Äôm working my way through PoF and looking ahead toward group content like fractals and raids. Are there any good resources that break down what each class contributes to group content? For example: the benefits of chronomancer support vs firebrand or renegade? 
---
Also how well might my experience with open world content reflect organized group content? Thanks!
---
Is this why they released shoulders and locked them behind black lion keys? Its bullshit, a horrible way to provide content, and I'm shocked we arent throwing a fit about it.
---
I couldn't disagree more with your second point. Events are the only thing that keeps me in the game. Improved, yes but if they ditch them in the future I will be extremely disappointed.
---
Yeah, bugs happen. In any game. Don't stress yourself.
---
&gt;FANTASTIC color and shading work.
---
This is what I was thinking. As awesome as the linework is, the color and shading are truly stellar.
---
And then it gets dropped by most of the player base in one-two months...
---
The GvG arena is the only reason to use EotM. For some reason they still decided to make it small and annoying to GvG at so the south plain is still used... it's literally a floating island on a dead map, the least you could do would be to make a reasonably sized arena...
---
Well, the thing is this time GW2 went as low as making the same money as Aion. And THAT'S bad.
---
**Why doesn't it matter?** They both look draconic in one way or another. Doesn't have to look like a western dragon to be a dragon if that's what you're getting at. 
---
I disagree. There's a clear visual improvement that 4K has over 1080p.
---
Despite being fairly old, GW2's textures are of high enough resolution that 4K yields a clear benefit.
---
They've basically made OS the lobby and let EotM die. Anet is just poorly using the available content and always too focused on creating new things with less longevity.
---
Totally agree with you.  Fighting near a Cliffside there really made positioning in a fight important.  Knockbacks and fear were serious weapons there.  
---
There is no indication whatsoever that there will be a patch at all today. Quite the opposite, since we had a patch last week. 
---
&gt;  as you have dragons wielding "multiple dragon powers" so to speak.
---
And how, per se, is this at all different?
---
You still have dragon minions imbued with multiple Elder Dragon domains. The only difference is the enslavement of will, and that shouldn't be causing immunity to dragon corruption.
---
&gt; Icebrood Quaggans are found in Frostgorge Sound, the map "dating" before even Zaithan's death where this is clearly not the case.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; [...]
---
&gt; Regarding Subject Alpha, here's what we find: "The side effect of being cross-corrupted was that Alpha not only gained abilities of different dragons' minions but also the power to bend any dragon minion under its will." Icebrood Quaggan do not manifest the same abilities.
---
I think you're misunderstanding my comment of countering the proclamation of "dragon minions cannot be corrupted by other dragons" with me supporting that guy's theory that quaggan are dragon minions. They're not, but not because of your reasoning.
---
Also, normal dragon minions cannot command any other dragon minions, and this would include all seen icebrood quaggans and almost all risen quaggans. Only dragon champions can lead other minions.
---
&gt; And why do you think Inquest aren't capable of doing more than the Elder Dragons? EDs are often compared to forces of nature. Is it so hard to imagine scientists inventing and creating something that doesn't occur naturally?
---
It's pretty obvious by now that the claim that Elder Dragons are "forces of nature" is pure unreliable narrator BS. It's been clear since Edge of Destiny, really, but people are ignorantly stuck in that mindset.
---
Elder Dragons are sapient, intelligent, and sometimes cunning.
---
And I stated why I said the Inquest aren't capable of doing more than the Elder Dragons. All they do to make dragon minions - including Subject Alpha and Kudu's Monster - is merely exposing things to dragon corruption in their labs. This is doing no more, and arguably less, than what Elder Dragons do.
---
The Inquest are literally doing the most primitive form of experiments when it comes to Elder Dragons. That is "let's see what happens when we expose X to Y".
---
They're not gene splicing shit up in the Crucible of Eternity or Rata Primus.
---
[Black diamonds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Diamond) and [exquisite black diamonds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Exquisite_Black_Diamond_Jewel) are different kinds of item. 
---
Even though all of them have the API type "upgradecomponent", the subtype of jewels like the exquisite diamond is "default" a, while the subtype of gemstones like the diamond is "gem".
---
https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?ids=72435&amp;lang=en  
---
https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?ids=76491&amp;lang=en
---
The 'default' ones are the ones that can't be put in any gear other than trinkets and backs, while the 'gem' ones can be put in any gear, and are stored in the bank.
---
Or more precisely Intact Mosaics.
---
I think it's incredible what they've done with Kralk so far given that insight. He has no nuance to his goals. He definitely comes across as the most relentless and unwavering dragon we've fought yet.
---
&gt; Just know it is against ToS.
---
Could you please clarify which part of it exactly against which part of the ToS?
---
While I agree that WvW wasn't played much by actual WvWers, it was still a great feature for us.
---
It provided a place for hypercasuals and ktrainers to "WvW" without having constant low-end ktrains on EB. Forcing all these players in WvW does give each side more bags to farm, but it doesn't promote more action. These players don't provide competition or action, they actively avoid it. 
---
I'd rather send this "WvW" population back to EOTM and have them ktrain in circles - which they clearly enjoy more - and have WvW be played with a smaller population - THAT ACTUALLY WANTS TO PLAY WVW - than have thousands of players that want to play; just not together or with remotely similar interests making the gamemode dead more often than not despite having hundreds of active players. 
---
Hey, I need the lifeforce!
---
A patch will be as two anet devs talked about it.
---
The maze is still an impressive work. Yes. It is. But i see "event" in the post title. No word about it ? Even in french. 
---
And sorry, but i'm still looking for the credits to all the fellows who helped you build this. Even if they're random, unknown or strangers, don't you think every snowflake "gifted" deserve a tiny but warm "thank you" ?
---
It's still an impressive build anyway. ;-)
---
beside just waiting around is there anything to do to speed up the alpha beetle spawn time in the far silverwastes?
---
&gt; EotM cannot be converted because it doesn't have many areas conducive to fun fights or sieges. The objectives are also too far apart. There's barely any room for mobility and nobody likes falling off cliffs or fighting on tiny bridges, it would just end in stalemate.   
---
&gt; It works for smaller style engagements and the environments are cool but it wouldn't be very fun for those try hard players and coordination that keep the mode going. 
---
All of this is true for desert bl. Anet doesnt' have a clue. 
---
Also the benefit of EOTM is that it attracts the players not interested in more "try hard" WvW and filters them out for a ktrain lyte edition. 
---
That's one of the annoying exceptions.
---
Someone must have made a mistake, and removing them is quite probably harder than adding new ones.
---
Another exception is the [Crafter's Backpack Frames](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crafter%27s_Backpack_Frame). They are the kind of item that you buy from the crafting vendor when you are going to use it, and do not need to keep in the bank or buy in bulk because even if you often level up crafting disciplines by crafting a lot of backs, you still won't buy them often enough to deserve a material slot.
---
A huge waste of a material slot.
---
Good games also fix their bugs. Istan has been out for a decent amount of time.
---
Mhm I think that is debatable, at least in the OP‚Äôs context, which seems to be open world.  
---
The burst you gain from traps are amazing however having perma quickness and higher might stacks is very nice in open world. Strictly speaking a solo power firebrand will have higher dps than a solo dragonhunter. It‚Äôs a sustained damage vs burst argument. 
---
In openworld/story content it is contextual which will serve you better. Dragonhunter is not strictly ‚Äúbetter‚Äù there. 
---
hey, it's me, your brother.
---
&gt; sylvari's immunity from dragon corruption is due to the Dream of Dreams
---
We've seen Awakened sylvari. I wonder what allows Joko to bypass this protection that Elder Dragons can't. It's not the same as corruption of course, but it's notably similar.
---
I do. It's the only meta in the game that I often fall asleep doing.
---
Visually the final fight is amazing, the soundtrack, the terrain - it's all well executed.
---
Mechanically it's a flop. The hardest part of the entire map is the mordrem champions in the towers, not the actual Elder Dragon. The mechanics of the fight have you sitting around doing almost nothing, waiting for a burn phase with no ability to speed it up. Compare that to Triple Trouble where each wurm head has it's own mechanics to trigger a burn phase.
---
While the lane phase functions well as a suitable build up to what is the united forces of Maguuma taking on an Elder Dragon and each lane represents the different allies we gathered (who were almost completely divorced in the instanced HoT story), it still takes too long. The laning phase just drags on, especially if one lane struggles in the towers. 
---
Overall I think Dragons Stand is a bit of a mess - visually and orchestrally it works really well, narratively it's not bad, but mechanically (especially balance) it's a pretty boring experience once the novelty wears off.
---
The Lunar New Year festival is ending today, but past that we don't have anything confirmed.  I doubt we will have much, but there is supposed to be a WvW announcement this week.  All we know on the WvW front is that it isn't about alliances.  I doubt they'll do balance today, but one can hope.  I'm holding off on some gear until after and I'm getting impatient.
---
You literally can. Do both. Meta maps and exploration maps. Silverwastes is the gold standard and it came out before HoT and PoF. The largest JP in the game, huge cavernous areas to explore underground (above ground is fun to explore with mounts), several layers of the meta and solid rewards delivered in multiple ways.
---
HoT had 100% meta maps. PoF had 100% exploration maps. The two aren't mutually exclusive - you can put exploration goals on meta maps, you can put metas on exploration maps, you can even have an expansion with a map solely for exploration and a different map *shock* with a meta.
---
You can't win when you go all in on one thing, but you can win if you go diverse.
---
I also think PoF is a bit of a failure for exploration maps because the rewards just don't hold up after the initial exploration. People run HoT metas partly because they are fun, but also because they are rewarding. PoF exploration is terribly rewarded and that's a major problem. Why is treasure hunting so bad? Why are the chests all around so stingy? It was a great opportunity to give us a repeatable activity that heavily utilised the PoF masteries - mounts - to explore and gather every day. Instead they give trash and you are better off spending your time chopping wood.
---
ArenaNet can win, they just go all in on one or the other leaving players overwhelmed by one thing and craving the other.
---
A game must remain a game. With or without competitive mode (PvP, WvW) or HL content (Fractals, raids), players should have fun playing it.
---
Clicking on a button just for the sake of clicking and supporting Logitech/Corsair/Razer business is not having fun.
---
Is the artist open for comissions?
---
&gt;I disagree. It's *always* been normal to put a game down for a while and come back later.
---
Openworld maybe. 
---
WvW? Nah.
---
PvP? Nah. 
---
Raids / fractals / dungeons?
---
Guilds &amp; giuld missions?
---
Dailies / monthlies? 
---
The openworld mentality of "put it down for a while and come back later" has infested the entire game; and makes it so that communities struggle to survive. And without communities, you lose a huge part of your population; as well as accessibility towards content. 
---
No, it's not.
---
Yup, envelopes can drop 2 figurines at once.
---
I know they are. Especially Jormag's way of corruption is too interesting, and Mordremoth could just speak to us and build puzzles to break us etc.
---
That's why I said strong, not mindless. What I try to tell is they are selfish giants which are bigger than anything. They can consume vast amounts of magic and still be hungry for more. We're talking about huge amounts of magic, to a degree which if we kill just one more, the world will fall apart. A force this strong cannot take sides. Will not make pacts which could be malicious for their cause. For them, we must be like animals. Sentient species like Seers, Forgotten or even Mursaat come and go. But they last, somehow, someway. Zhaitan's magic still resurrects Shatterer for example. 
---
BTW, I have been sending my daily envelopes to him via ingame mail from a few accounts and he is a pretty trustable source to sell those envelopes. Just a side note.
---
I don't know why, but I love Kay from the deepstone fractal. "I am NOT okay with giant spiders talking !" feels so dramatic..
---
The envelopes can drop 1-2 Boar Figurines.
---
Can confirm this! fast and reliable! 
---
I wouldn't call undeath similar to corruption. Even with Zhaitan, who can and has corrupted the living, dragon corruption is often a case of transforming a "material" from A to B. In Zhaitan's case, it was turning flesh into decay, nearly instantly for the dead, while slowly to the living.
---
Undeath is effectively turning a body into a construct to house the original soul (as opposed to resurrection that would be returning the body to a living state as well as returning the soul) while controlling the mind to some degree. Corruption would be turning the body itself into the relevant element, without a soul more often than not, and erasing the old mind/will with a new one.
---
Not the Mordy!
---
GW2 is doing the exact same. They're losing a large portion of their customers by only providing content for one subgroup. The only difference is that this time it's the casual playerbase. 
---
And as a result? Income declines, content output declines, and the vicious circle continuous. Who'd have fucking thought? Oh wait everyone who didn't reduce these issues to one-liners then pretend they have the obvious solution as if nobody ever thought of it. 
---
One of those two is the correct place, but you need to get to the correct location and take a screenshot from up there.

Which makes it 1g 39s 17c pure gold (trophies) per enveloppe. Usual number confirmed :)
---
When some of your competitors like ESO, WoW, FF release expansions almost once a year keeping players engaged in your game is difficult when you do 2 year expansion cadence. Combine this with a lack of a end game gear treadmill,  players begin to lose interest. 
---
(Not saying the competitors expansion were good,  just that they receive hype and attract players.)
---
FF is releasing a new race this year - a female bunny race (lol) ,  ESO is releasing a new expansion with a new class. This will continue to pull players from GW2. New LW chapters will not offset this. 
---
(The bunny girls will definitely pull some of GW2 main demographic üòõ )
---
The two are connected. Guilds and communities don't exist if all content is completable "solo" no matter what you do. As long as everything is designed to just "work out" even when done by completely random players who aren't even trying to improve; there's no reason for guilds and communities to exist.
---
I think they could have some bigger thing planned for 2020.
---
I know it's been discussed a million times and everyone says no but a GW2.5 with improved engine, improved UI, improved overall systems, maybe even a "side chronic" system to replace those stupid achievement-questlines, that would o alot for the game.
---
God, Can you imagine a DS style map for Kralk where we would have to jump off of airships onto his giant body. 
---
Most likely. Changing stats gives you the generic named ascended armor piece. They are not precursor equipment. 
---
The support may be able to help though, I'd try that first. 
---
Why doesn't this stop all these GW2 players from quitting? 
---
Oh right the game becomes progressively worse. 
---
If you used the mystic forge to change the stats and it's no longer the original item type then you won't be able to upgrade it. Is the name of the item after changing stats the same as the pvp vendor name?
---
You could try asking support to restore the item if it's not. As long as you can prove the account had one and what happened to it.
---
As if your character comes back home after a long day of hard field study. 
---
Meanwhile I‚Äôm going for ‚Äúmost luck sold to drooburt‚Äù in case that one ever shows up.  I‚Äôve sold over 39m luck to him this year :D
---
&gt; GW2 is considered by a lot of people to be one of the top 4 MMORPG's, with WOW, FFXIV, and ESO. I think in terms of quality of content, gameplay, graphics it definitely is.
---
By a lot of players on this sub? Around release GW2 did compete with these games. But GW2 has been declining faster than WoW and FFXIV for a long time. This sub just has incredibly rose-coloured glasses towards the game they prefer and its community. 
---
Don't take me wrong, the base game is amazing and GW2 did a lot of things right. But it also did a lot of things wrong which alienated a lot of players.
---
I really liked eotm, rarely go there now after all the changes.
---
Good points, though you said that the take a side and it's theirs. Which is my ultimate idea to explain why this theory won't make sense. All the other things I said weren't citated, more like my idea of understanding their complex nature.
---
As a sentient species, we used animals too for the similar reasons. This is one level beyond so we have no way to understand their real motive. When we can't comprehend things, we compare them to simpler things like saying an elder dragon is just a bad wind.

Plenty of people play mobile games. It's a low barrier to entry given most people have phones and look for something to kill time. I know many people who opt for a mobile optiob rather than being on their computer because they spend the whole day looking at one at work. 
---
I think primordus would fit this method pretty well. Since the ‚Äòredesign‚Äô I can‚Äôt help but think they are planning to have the new look be an outer shell he formed much like his minions. A large scale meta event destroying this shell followed by an instance to deal with the real primordus from seen in gw1 would be cool.

You might be maxing out your CPU, particularly if YouTube is stuttering rather than just pausing to buffer. On the Performance tab in Task Manager, you should be able to see both CPU usage and network usage to see which is the culprit.
---
I still find it pretty funny that after the mentions of it destiny edge 2.0 pretty much got dumped.
---
That is, for those of us that can't do currency exchanges in our heads, just shy of 14 million USD, putting the year's total at about 71.4 million. That adds up to a pretty tidy profit by my estimation, unless server costs and/or ANet's average salary are higher than I anticipated.

Orion's wife (Side) wasn't turned into a stork. Hera threw her into Hades because she dared compare her beauty to Hera's one. \^\^
---
For the same reason, Hera turned Antigone's hair into snakes (Antigone of Troy, Daughter of Laomedon). Later, gods pitying her turned her into a stork.
---
Q4 2012 were the first time Halloween and Wintersday happened. They hit the festive holiday market *hard.* And with the "Lost Shores" teasers (posters in LA, Dead whales washing up on the beach, the unfortunate limited time event when the karka attacked LA) stuff happening, there was a lot of "this is amazing! In an MMO! Its got some problems but its got so much potential!!" kind of talk from sites and journalists covering the game. 
---
Also, during Q3 2015 and Q4 2015, GW2 moved to its F2P model, and the lower earnings of season 3 probably reflect that- new players aren't required to pay admissions to get into the themepark mmo.
---
Earnings aren't flatly indicative of the enjoyability or quality of the content.  
---
I've done specimen chamber twice just this week during off-hours. People still hang around that map bc it's a great VM farm. 
---
The game should be fun, but fun is also subjective. You may like PvE but hate PvP, which means you'd also hate the PvP Achievements. But while you dislike them, others would enjoy them but may hate the Story Mastery Achievements instead. Some players also like slow, contentious grinds on occasion, so it isn't bad to have some achievements like that (e.g. A Pack Dolyak's Best Friend).
---
But Achievements are optional bonus things that you don't have to do. Hunting Achievements is part of the game, but it isn't the game itself. Some achievements can be a downright pain to get, whether through difficulty or grind. But even if they are universally agreed to be not fun by all types of players, that dosn't mean it was designed wrong because it wasn't fun. Most players don't play games because they expect every optional achievement to be fun; they play it because the game is fun. So if you do only play to hunt Achievements and you dislike the way achievements are designed, then clearly the game is not for you. But if you like the game for the game, then you should be able to just ignore the achievements you don't like.
---
Ooooor it is is users like you and me that downvote, just a thought.
---
Power DH is one of the best shit for open world cause you go sa fast to kill foe, you dont need that alactricity or that might for firebrand when everything is melted in a second
---
ANet always develops new systems and instantly drops them because they dont want to admit their fuckups so insted of refining a system they just throw it into the trash and move on to the next one.
---
It's a game.  The purpose is to have fun.  
---
If you're not having fun, what's the point??  It's a game.  GW2 doesn't even have a subscription.  
---
This isn't marriage, or a work contract.
---
&gt; One map and a few achievements every three months isn't enough.
---
Considering their resources, and the quality problems with some of the maps, and how their focus on LW has negatively affected other gamemodes, it's more than enough.
---
Many people agree (including me) that we don't need a new map for every single episode. If we get less quantity with more quality it will be better.
---
Why does none tell him about shortbow renegade ? Most satisfying auto attack in game, little combos which are easy (4+3), a skill which tags ERRYTHING and rewards you for placing well (3), mass CC avaliable whenever you don't feel like that smokescale plays fair, a way to make your attacks unblockable...
---
Seriously, if you like playing heavy armor bow builds, try it it'll be worth your while (get grieving stats from that free ls4 armor collection, they are great for open world)
---
Wintersday and Halloween came out for the first time, aswell as the Lost Shores, which most people remember as a lag riddled abomination and error fiesta, was pretty well hyped- the dead whales washing up in LA, the warnings in new kyrtan about going swimming and the consortium npcs smacking away on that broken asura gate. 
---
The content itself- outside the limited time event when they turned LA into a combat zone and scaled all players to 80 to fight against the karka  that destroyed the lighthouse in a 3 FPS fuckdown, the evolving new story branch that introduced Canach as a villain-ish type guy, the free new map (Southsun)- There was just new stuff after new stuff after new stuff, and that outweighed the fuckery of some of the implementation that players then will remember most.
---
You gotta remember that they are in the middle of reworking world v world and edge of the mists will defo get a rework too, probably after living world season 4 is finish
---
The point was what ever the core do elite specs do better. I think i said it two times even that it is possible to play it but elite specs are mostly better. Not all are better in all game modes, but in WvW for example, core guard is pure shit compared to firebrand. Can the person play core guard in WvW, ofc he can, but can he do what the firebrand do for his party, not in a million years. THAT was my point.
---
If I were you I'd subbmit a support ticket for a replacement for that armor with the original and wait for about a week. Usually they are very good at replacing items lost/changed! Good luck!
---
In the east yes for sure. But looking how this was recieved at Blizcom for US and EU and only on mobile well if you did not watch the video then do, it is so cringy you want to turn it off and pretend it did not happen.
---
There's literally ambient dialogue in Divinity's Reach where a guy says he hates centaurs because horses are made for riding or some such. There's also art depicting riders entering battle on horseback, and texts describing the same events, and horse stables.
---
They aren't mythological, they just haven't been shown. It's general player headcanon that they "aren't real" because they haven't been explicitly shown as an ambient creature/enemy type/mount.
---
I didn't get that impression when it fresh content, but haven't been there since Istan was nerfed into dust.
---
But the achievements should be about achieving something notable in the game. Playing the game, doing stuff, doing content. Double clicking and pressing *1* 1300 times isn't serious "content".
---
If between those 3, I'd say go for Power Dragonhunter/Guardian. They are in a good spot right now and can play multiple roles (power, condi, support) so it will feel like you're playing multiple classes.
---
/r/evilbuildings
---
Apologies for misunderstanding! 
---
I never really do that content myself, so it was a guess. My bad. 
---
Personally I appreciate GW2 for the more casual parts of it, but to each their own. 
---
Basically a pink reskin of [Golden Feather Wings](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Golden_Feather_Wings_Glider.jpg). For comparison: [Wings of Love](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Wings_of_Love_Glider.jpg)
---
Wings of love backpack, if you already have the glider do you get the backpack?
---
As it stands renegade, FB &amp; chrono are really the only ones that can.
---
Scrapper engineer could with a few basic changes to the elixer GM &amp; Applied force (so that they would share boons).
---
Warrior could if the GM for their stances caused them to share stance effects (maybe also share some of the quickness it grants itself as zerker)
---
Necro could be amazing with it if they could just share some of the boons they only grant themselves.
---
As for everyone else they don't really bring enough to justify it even if they could share what they grant themselves.
---
i figure it was mostly like the mursaat after gw:prophecies, they pretty much got exterminated
---
Boon thief (primarily useful on Matthias) can make good use of Diviner stats, as can Strength rune Fire for Effect Deadeye as it allows you to maintain full Might over 10 people with only three stolen skills per rotation. 
---
&gt;  dungeons with procedural path obstacles and monster spawns
---
rerolling for swamp tells me that this would not go over well.
---
Right, but like I said, give me a good reason as why you cant just use consume all on fireworks, like you do with other consumeables for achievements.
---
You didn't respond that. Simply saying its meant to do over time instead of having a consume all is bullshit, because otherwise why does festive imbiber have consume all? That achievement should be done over time too with this logic.
---
Bottom line, you're basically telling me there is no reason they don't have the option to consume all. So why argue that at all?
---
Well you're definitely not in Kansas anymore
---
I think WvW is designed to simply be a MMO sandbox PvP with conquest added to it. Leaders and people who stand up and put a tag have the most influence on the map and score. It is an ambitious game mode that few games dared to make as there are many balance cons in it. On the other hand it offers a unique experience. You go with a fantasy army and take keeps, farms and castles and you fight against other fantasy armies. What really makes it unique that its a 1v1v1, or 3 factions fighting each other for control. The only other game I know that has that is the MMO FPS Planetside 2 (if you heard of Planetside Arena, yeah that's is it's 6 years old predecessor). It is a screwed yet unique game mode that simply requires you to invest time to understand it, and to die many many times.
---
Is the DPS worth it?
---
Why do people keep thinking there was going to be any patch this week. Anet haven't announced a balance patch, or any patch. They did one last week Anet don't do weekly patches they do bi weekly patch meaning a patch every 2 weeks.
---
Kind of annoyed that I cant buy the backpack separate.... I had gotten the glider the last time they had it out. Now I'm forced to buy both if I want it :( 
---
Hope is a strong force.
---
I main thief. But I'll tell you, if you're new and want an easy time doing big damage. Go with dragonhunter.
---
I usually bring my DH to daily t4's and raids because it has a lot of things going for it. A lot of sustain even if you're a dps. Great damage with a really simple rotation. It even brings somewhat decent amount of CC.
---
You can't go wrong with a DH.
---
 nO dAmAsK PaTcH!? 
---
but...you get a piano noise and there's a better backpack now.
---
Didn't that\_shaman datamine some text saying you get the backpack for free if you already bought the glider?
---
Yes, I got in game mail telling me to visit the black lion specialist vendor
---
&gt; Most commanders will choose to go to the border they are most likely to find good fights, regardless of their preference of map design. 
---
This is 100% correct. However it ignores the fact that desert bl's DESIGN doesn't promote good action / fights / .... That's why the DESIGN of the map from a functional point of view is shit; regardless of how pretty it is.
---
&gt; The fact that red border is known to have less fights going on ensures that it continues to be the case, since even the players who like it will end up defaulting to alpine for fights. If red border was where most fights happened, the remaining players who genuinely dislike it would suck it up and go there anyway. 
---
This again ignores the fact that the border is DESIGNED in a way that DOES NOT PROMOTE fights, ever. That's what ensures the map will be shit, forever. 
---
You tell me the map would be popular if it was the best for fights... But it's OBJECTIVELY the worst for fights. That's why almost every fight guild and fight commander hates it. Going to desert BL is the "last option if nothing else is fun" similar to going to EOTM. You don't expect good fights there, but at least you can farm some bags. 
---
In order to promote fights, you need a gradual change in objective strength. There need to be objectives which groups of various relative strength can fight over. And these objectives need to make the "fight" more even. That's how you get good fights.
---
So groups that are similar in strength should fight openfield or over easy objectives. Groups that are widely different in strength should have "difficult" objectives for the strong group to try and push. This makes it so that groups of different sizes and strength can still have meaningful interaction.
---
Desert BL doesn't do this. There are no easy objectives to fight over that people will bother defending. There is also no progresion through the map. Want an easy objective? You've got camps and southern towers which are rarely defended because nobody wants to run that far. Medium objectives? Run to the enemy spawn and hit T3 north towers. All keeps on the map favour the defender so, so, so much that they're only attacked when you already have a significant advantage. They don't promote "good fights". 
---
These keeps don't promote fighting over. They promote farming plebs while not carring about capping, or giving plebs a chance to not get completely fucked so they can feel relevant despite still being trash. 
---
Add to this that the keeps upgrade at insane speeds making it a whole lot more meaningless to actually downgrade objectives, which also pushes the map into this "overly defensive" state. Equal groups (which is what leads to good fights) dont' have ANYTHING to fight over on desert bl.
---
&gt; On a different point, the funny thing is that the most common complaints about red border (towers having no tactical significance, long time to run from middle to outer keeps, obnoxious keep lord mechanics, difficult to counter defensive siege spots) are primarily PPT related problems. In terms of providing numerous and interesting places to fight it is, in my opinion, the best map of the lot yet it has ended up as the map where, generally speaking, PPT players and roamers go and fight guilds avoid. 
---
This hurts to read. You know what? If i'm going to do a BvB or GvG and agree to fight with enemies, desert bl is a GREAT map. It's empty and dead, so both sides can get their players in and it has space down south which is open. 
---
Your opinion is irrelevant because it shows you have no clue how WvW really works. I'm sorry but all those issues you summed up are exactly why fight groups avoid the map like the plague that it is. Unless you pm another fight group and say "hey, lets go ignore 99% of the map design and just fight for luls", the map won't generate good interaction between groups. It promotes sitting on unhittable siege and shooting at walls / players that can't touch you. 
---
How is that NOT a major design issue if you want to... fight other players? 
---
I'll ask a simple question. If you were a commander, how would you find / create good or fun fights for your group? 
---
TL DR : Analysis ignores the influence of map design on generating (good) fights.
---
No. No alternative offensive Might share build (Mirage, Tempest, Deadeye, PS warrior) will be truly worth it, at least in a raiding environment, until the issue of Druid bringing 25 Might over 10 people and unique boons and healing is addressed.
---
Compared with just using a Druid and a true DPS build, the opportunity cost of a non-Druid healer and offensive might share is too high. 
---
Nope.
---
Because everyone seems to forget a tiny thing. 
---
The alcohol you drink doesn't do much other than make you drunk.
---
The fireworks however apply an effect on you that can only be stacked up to two hours.
---
And there is your reason why you can't consume them all and that is why I said it is something that  you should work on while the festival is active and that everything at once is your own choice by "wasting" that effect.
---
You'll never get to the mysterious charr's village this way!
---
Try talking to the scout in VB and see if you get it, or you might have it in your mail? It was datamined that you should get it for free.
---
Check the Black Lion Exchange Specialist, last tab at the bottom.
---
&gt;  Leaders and people who stand up and put a tag have the most influence on the map and score. 
---
No they don't. Jobless players that are willing to karmatrain in the middle of the night, when nobody else is actively playing, have the most influence on map and score. PPT is more heavily determined by nightcap, not by active primetime groups / commanders.
---
that seems pretty cool
---
My only complaints is the path finding bullshit required for utilities.
---
Logically they should be craftable, but practically I don't think it really matters. Either we loot the Serpentite Jewels directly, or we loot an accountbound Orb that we then need to craft into a Serpentite Jewel.
---
Working fine over here! I love these runes so much. My mirage says hello ^^ 
---
The expansions contain only endgame content, but there is other endgame content to partake in, like WvW and (un)ranked PvP. Along bunch of PvE things. But it is true that most of the endgame content is in the expansions
---
Nope, I did not forget about that.
---
You see I asked for a good reason and the only reason I included **good** was because I figured this would be your comeback and I literally don't think it's a good enough reason.
---
It's an issue I would call "hand holding". How much should the devs hold our hands is a question for another time and day. But honestly sometimes I wish they wouldn't think of their player base as braindead children.
---
For example, when legendary armor was new you could literally salvage it. A huge oversight by Anet sure and it got fixed. But you bet your ass people still did it for science and of course it shouldn't be a thing with a damn LEGENDARY and I commend Anet for fixing it relatively fast. That is a good use of hand holding.
---
Now is fireworks really that though? A stack of the cheapest available firework is 1 gold 80 silver currently. If someone chows down on a stack of them I wouldn't say that much was lost.
---
Even comparing it to festive imbiber again, imagine you're at 9999 drinks and accidentally consume all on a stack of drinks. Wheres the hand holding there? Non existant.
---
I would be willing to take the risk in this case, if people want the buff they can read the damn tooltip that pops up when you hover over them that says "stacks duration up to 2 hours". After all if they are going for the buff I assume they already read that, since they most likely read the line right above it that says what the buff is to begin with.
---
It's a case of choice and in this case I certainly choose the lesser evil of peope being taught a lesson for basically what is scraps in todays gw2 economy, over people getting arthritis.
---
because the metas been stale and mirage/soulbeast OP for multiple months now, thats why. Last balance patch was a joke
---
F keys are thrown AoE elixirs - or are they not affected by concentration?
---
If you live in the United States GameStop sells them at 15$ instead of thirty. If you have access to a game stop in your country you could check there.
---
People waiting for balance patch is one thing, I wonder why anyone cares about balance patches anymore.
---
it's braindead easy and a desired class
---
&gt;The endgame of GW2 is aesthetics
---
Simply not true.  
---
GW2's endgame is whatever you make it. WvW, PvP, Raids, exploration, RPing, Collections, Achievements. There's much more then just aesthetics. Some couldn't care less about them and play GW2 solely for it's different take on combat.  
---
Other then that, i agree with you. The problem is, Guild Wars has never had prestigious items or titles. And if they did, they got nerfed into oblivion and lost any prestigious status it had.  
---
LDOA, reduced to nothing.  
---
GWAMM, reduced to nothing.  
---
Survivor, reduced to nothing.  
---
This applies to many of GW2's aspects as well. There's no long term goal whatsoever.
---
I‚Äôm not realy getting what you are trying to say. Isn‚Äôt basicly every elite specialization core +? And isn‚Äôt the elite spec supposed to revolve around its own unique weapon and mechanics? 
---
Again I fail too see what you want to mean/proof because what you say, to me, is very contradictory
---
Take care, or you char may like like one of [them](https://imgur.com/a/A6RLHPg) soon. Guess they were waiting for a balance patch too.
---
I forgot these chairs exist at all.
---
Ultimately, to the board it doesn't matter where the money comes from. That said, I highly doubt that the normal PC/Console MMOs are going away for the very reason you state. Even with Mobile Markets far outpacing the PC/Console markets, for the time being said markets are still too large to throw away. If they were smart, they'll just focus experiences for each type of player.
---
Where it gets tricky is the Blizzard situation (or rather just a part of it) where players of a certain franchise feel that games carrying X name should only ever be built a certain way otherwise the brand is sullied. While I can see that perspective, it makes sense for the business to use brand power to make a game that uses a brand to target users and get them to play. Those users won't be the same that play the PC games in the series, but that's not important to the business.
---
the one with the mom is particularly terrifying.
---
Can't wait to spam 2
---
I wasn't complaining, sorry if it seemed that way. 
---
And you're right. Looking at the the history of the wiki pages, the Golden Feather was created 02/16 and the Wings of Love was created 02/09.
---
Sure but its just a tiny part if your skills that rely on that mechanic, not your whole main bar. 
---
And its not because I find this too random and undesirable(myself, anyone else is free to disagree) that we have to instead use a mindless and boring mechanic. I just believe we could find a better balance between "randomness" and challenge/strategy in a elige spec. 
---
Thief steal works fine for 1 ability, maybe 2, but a full bar just becomes too complicated, even more so than remembering cooldowns on ele. 
---
You can level up to 80 and play the core game that we did for 3 years. There is plenty to do to keep you occupied for a while. BUt i am not going to lie in the long run at some point you will want to have the expansion but by then maybe you could wish for it as a birthday gift or there is a sale or the like so start the game and enjoy the leveling and then you will see how it goes.
---
I Never Really said anything against this being a good reason I just questioned the general statement that those achievements are boring.
---
I mean if I only farm then GW2 would also be boring but if I use those fireworks as they are supposed to be used I don't see an issue with this.
---
I'm the exact opposite. I'm by no means the best druid, but I'm competent. More importantly, I have major trust issues and just don't trust anyone else to play heals during especially difficult runs.
---
No
---
The success of MHW is based on 3 fundamental pillars: First a franchise that has lasted more than 10 years of satisfied players who have seen their personal skill progression count also in this new chapter while enjoying at the same time the news, Second a graphic improvement awaited for years that has brought to the spotlight of the world all the other qualities that have always been shown in the past, Third the collaborations with other videogames integrated with the standard updates that have continue to keep the title interesting and almost devoid of dead times.
---
they did the same with all the wings that were initially released without a glider. It's a logic move considering both backpack and glider are the same exact skin.
---
&gt;As a general policy, ANY form of unattended gameplay is prohibited in Guild Wars 2. This includes:
---
&gt;    The use of auto-casting abilities to farm while not at your computer or not actively playing the game.  
---
Jeez, they really made a rule out of that... What's next, making it illegal to afk with active pets/minions?
---
It's going to be mostly the same game before you reach level 80, whether you're f2p or own any/both expansions.
---
You won't be able to buy much in the Trading Post but you don't really have to while leveling. The gear you find along the way is more than enough.
---
If you reach level 80 and decided you like the game, that's when being f2p would lock you out of a good chunk of content and possibilities.
---
ahahaha
---
And me too, If I see the end fight to fight the head only, confirmed Im quit.
---
have you tried grieving?
---
a little bit "/s", yeah, but i still use my exotic grieving armor on my firebrand... for fun.. yeah..
---
Ima keep it real with you chief. Are you honestly expecting any meaningful, meta changing nerfs to Mirage?
---
LWS - Living World Season
---
KWN MN - I surmise means Korean Won in Millions
---
Well, i did understand that. Then, why just... not to do it ? Or doing it while waiting something else ? It's boring to wait too. A lot of people does that. While waiting to join spvp, while waiting a race start. Much less boring that way. :-)
---
Actually, the Fractals of the Mists are accessible in the core game. These are mini dungeons that scale on a difficulty from 1 to 100, 75-100 being the highest tier = end game content. You won't have access to raids though.
---
Great, then that leads me back to my previous post.
---
"Bottom line, you're basically telling me there is no reason they don't have the option to consume all. So why argue that at all?"
---
You agree that handholding shouldn't be this tight. That's great and you're allowed to do the achievement however you feel like doing it. After all it seems both you and me did complete it with thousands of clicks.
---
But that doesn't mean that consume all shouldn't be a thing. So you should see no issue with people having an easier time to complete it.
---
Either way you swing it, I feel like further arguing won't lead anywhere, so I wish you a good night wherever you are. I hope that you didn't feel any hostility your way, because I didnt mean to attack you or your beliefs personally. I just wanted to communicate and see why you think differently. :)
---
Daily rewards
---
Every day, there's a new set of daily fractals which give extra rewards for completing them once a day. 
---
And even when you aren't doing dailies, fractals drop encryptions, which are chests that contain loot to sell
---
Would it be acceptable to edit a screenshot? I would like to take pictures of two of my characters (who are girlfriends) posing at the same spot, and combine the two pics.
---
That looks spooky :O i love it !   
---
I wouldnt go there alone heheh 
---
Lol sounds like you need more in your life than GW2
---
thanks
---
Doing open world PvE and going "SEE I WAS RIGHT" whenever they step into WvW and can't find a pugmander ready to cater to their entitled demands.
---
Yes, please post an update. I'm sure you'll attract even more participants once you get back into it.
---
&gt;Tu est s√©rieux tuborg ? tu va me dire comment je dois proc√©d√© et faire mes vid√©os ?   
---
Oui y'a pas d'info sur l'event car on a pas les dates et √ßa n‚Äôemp√™che pas de faire des vid√©os de pr√©sentations et pour les remerciement je compte le faire une fois l‚Äô√âv√©nement termin√© ce qui me parais logique car sans toutes ces personnes cela n'aurais pas √©t√© r√©alisable tu imagine devoir faire un g√©n√©rique a chaque vid√©o de d√©co pour y indiqu√© qui a donner quoi ? j'aurais 1 minute de vid√©o pour 2 minutes de g√©n√©rique donc oui je vais remercier les gens en question sur la vid√©o de l'event final

la √ßa reste des vid√©os de pr√©sentation sur ce que la guilde peut propos√©.
---
For those that are looking for maximum Wardrobe Unlock value, it may be worth to finish the dungeons' collections, yes.
---
Oh it definitely does. The thing is I play exclusively in pugs. When my party members are running all over the place and not stacking well, I just prefer not to be rooted to the spot for like 3 whole seconds and be able to stay in range of most of them with my other skills. 
---
Most builds that are considered "meta" require elite specs and gear sets that are locked behind expansions. If you are at all serious about doing fractals, and unless you solely play banner Warrior or zerker Guardian, you will want one or both expansions. 
---
I dare say player will still buy gem store items regardless of the inclusion of in game items. 
---
I mean, we still got new weapon and armor sets and people still buy skins from the gem store. You don't have to pick one method or the other. They just have in these instances.
---
People are probably caring because they are worrying the game might die soon.
---
They won't do it when you get part of a glider/back combo from a wardrobe unlocker, tho. It kind of sucks having to buy the combo when that happens, since it won't get even a discount. 
---
so true, was going point that out. app games only make money if its a new ip or spinoff. but app games 90% of them are a fad before they loose most of thirr income n users. its like the mmorpg market, ppl stop tryin to make them due to they have a 80% fail rate, look at gw2... game is just unfun and pof so far been a masstive dispointment
---
Well, there goes all the gold I made from the new year.
---
&gt; And for god's sake, stop making new systems, and stick to the ones you have and support them properly.
---
Can this please be a permanent pinned post on reddit in which every account of every dev gets pinged weekly? I mean sure this is an exaggeration but it is SOOO true. 
---
If bought from gemstore at least. 
---
Can't say for those who got it from a wardrobe unlocker or statuettes.
---
also the issue is how bliz handled it... we wanted d4... instead they got a reskin app game...and some how i no longer have a phone...Mmmm magic

Is there a reason this backpack is so stiff? These wings are like rocks they don't move AT ALL. Luckily I got it through the exchange thing, glad I didn't spend money on it.
---
You are getting downvoted to hell and back but i think there is a grain of truth in that. 
---
I have not seen a single person rocking Logan's Pact Marshal Outfit or Zafirah's Tactical Outfit or Haunted Armor Outfit. But i still see people in Kasmeer's Regal Outfit pretty much daily.
---
But then again im not a fan of modest outfit on any of my chars. My male norn show belly and muscle my female sylvari show leaves and twigs. I think there is a way to make things more equal without censoring everything.

---
No. Issue is that some people are good at photoshop or editing images while others are not. So ideally we would like just the normal screenshots for this contest.
---
Thanks
---
They nerfed exlixer U a while back, it no longer grants quickness.
---
If they had not nerfed that &amp; would simply change applies force GM scrapper trait to do its quickness in aoe then scrapper healer would actually be damn close to meta.
---
Open world ps is good

Whereas AB Multiloot and Istan were *fine.*
---
Sadly the crit lost &amp; the fact it doesn't share any other worth while boons keeps it from being wort it.
---
Like I said above if war got some changes to its stance GM to share boons from stances as well as a couple other traits changes then diviners war would be worth it.
---
Same goes for alchemist engineer.
---
I always get this wrong :(
---
Didnt watch any of the videos
---
wait does that mean in 2012, 120k purchases were made or 120k in total profit? If thats the case how is this game still running?
---
A conversion holo with shield, turrets, elixirs and more importantly the hard light arena; it's awsome especially where you get often chilled/slow/immob.
---
If only mirage would go through as many changes as chronomancer...
---
I sense sarcasm.
---
But they didnt give optimization or content or features at faster pace. It would be nice if they do atleast one of those things.
---
Is it?
---
Bad for a different reason, to be fair.
---
 You can get pretty much everything (exotic mostly) at the tomb of primeval kings for elegy mosaics and some gold, if you did legendary bounties for a bit, you should be totally covered.
---
I think condi firebrand uses viper stuff, but i like going power, prec, ferocity, condition damage and  get my burning duration from runes and sigils
---
my fav mechanic is waves and waves of mobs :) its a good way to keep the game fresh!
---
There is an associated cost which comes with running an MMO of this caliber as well as paying salaries to employees.
---
yeah give us a gore magala raidboss, FF already got their rathalos.
---
Hehehee :D 
---
that reminds me, i need to watch the old movie :O
---
Start a fundraise
---
Anet nerfed dungeon rewards to get people to stop doing them lol.  The profits were only ridiculous for people in coordinated groups.  It is some of the only content in this game that rewards skill with more gold per hour.
---
Guild Wars 2 has very poor raid content in terms of design, balance, release cadence, quantity and general quality. It has been over two and a half years of fights like Keep Construct and it keeps throwing up interesting bugs and problems. To see CA do this, sadly, isn't all that surprising.
---
Nah. Narga or Jinouga pls
---
users like you and I that only downvote posts criticizing anet?  Do you honestly believe a multi million dollar company with a social media team isn't going to try and censor a social media platform in favor of their company?  Do you understand how capitalism works?
---
&gt;  LWS1 was the best thing ever (I missed it, sucks to be me) 
---
Or was it maybe just the game still being relatively new?
---
I think the announcement was poorly handled and shouldn't have been positioned as a part of the BlizzCon hype. They did however tell fans to not expect a D4 announcement during BlizzCon, that part I have no sympathy for.... that said, I don't understand why they thought announcing a mobile game during the BlizzCon presentation was a good idea..... specifically at the end - a spot usually reserved for hype announcements.
---
There is soulbeast. DIVERSITY
---
I think that Outflanked would be a lot more fun than Convergence :)
---
&gt;wasted development time
---
Arenanet in a nutshell sadly
---
See above.  Censoring social media is very common in today's business climate, it's low cost with high impact.  Every other company with an international presence is doing it, why would anet be excluded?
---
I remember making post about soulbeast on the same day of last balance patch saying how they didn't fix anything and how it's still gonna be broken in wvw.
---
Got butchered by pvp players saying that it will be balanced since main skills of boonbeast got nerfed.
---
I don't play pvp.
---
Who's laughing now :^)
---
Because its fucking retarded, a waste of time and money, and also useless. Downvoting comments, really? 
---
Youre desperately trying to be right and it shows. Just stop. 
---
It's always great to see a new ~~bug~~ feature of raid fights.
---
I had this problem too, but I recently had success getting it to spawn by doing the Mordrem Threat event that spawns in that area first. The alpha beetle spawns in either the top left corner, or the left corner, of the Far Silverwastes, so be sure to not miss where it spawns. Good luck!
---
Oh damn, that would be a twist. A massive, ever-growing army with no purpose in the world.
---
oh, ok 100 mill isn't bad at all for 1 quarter i can see how this game can sustain off 15 mil are quarter but still not crazy money when fortnite made like 300 mil in a month
---
We kinda already got a prototype "quest hub" with the keep that came with Jahai Bluffs.  It was fairly well integrated into the episode.
---
Probably just serves to teach the mechanic of the upcoming fight where you need to blow up the bombs the fight the skeleton. :p
---
They know how (sorta). They nerfed HoT elite specs just before PoF. They just want to sell the newest expansion through semi P2W tactics.
---
 don't you guys have phones? 
---
Thing is, aesthetics are (or can be) the gateway to a lot of that content.  I do dungeons for skins.  I did PVP for skins.  I do WvW for skins.  I did Ad Infinitum for skins.  I've gotten skins from raids (just not the one I'm really after, yet).  Skins are the enduring reward for doing the content.
---
Gimme that Fluffy Paolumu armor! 
---
No but I used my firebrand w/ quickness shout, mantra, traits etc. and managed to complete it with perma-quickness thus faster
---
KC, Largos and Djinns. Not a single new enemy model. Feelsbad.
---
Wow! That's quality artwork!
---
I remember back when it was the fastest way to level, was fun.
---
its used in gvg nowadays
---
I wouldn't say that raid quality is poor. It does have issues especially with the release schedule but I enjoy most bosses and clear multi please times a week. Also I don't really see boss breaking bugs regularly even in W3 and although we haven't tried to replicate it, we did try a different strat yesterday which probably was the cause of this.
---
WvW has literally never been balanced. 
---
And they cannot be branded... If only we knew half a dozen powerful Mesmers to trick them that Balthazar wants to kill Kralk again.

Hey all! As I mentioned in my last post, I started working on Lunar
---
New Year themed mounts during last year's event. After finishing work
---
on the [Roller Pig
---
concept](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/w8OL16), I decided to go
---
back and finish the others!
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
*Some insights!*
---
*The raptor and jackal were made last year so they're a bit rougher
---
than the others.
---
*The jackal skin is based on the
---
[saluki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saluki). I started with a
---
greyhound, but liked the flowing fur of the saluki's ears and tail.
---
They're also considered to be faster than greyhounds over long
---
distances.
---
*The skimmer was the most difficult to come up with as none of zodiac
---
animals resemble its unique shape. The dragon seemed like the best fit
---
(with the snake second) since they are often depicted as floating. I
---
came across a [dragon-turtle hybrid](https://imgur.com/a/EQeU7gI)
---
while looking for inspiration. I built off of that concept by using a
---
sea turtle and trying to match the existing skimmer's proportions.
---
I hope you all enjoy!
---

Also, Power Guard of some flavor has always been in the "useful" camp, even if it dropped out of meta for speed runs from time to time.  Power DH just feels like Power Guard+++, has a pretty easy rotation, and isn't painful to run solo or open world.  Would recommend.
---
can we have a graph showing the amount of content introduced to the game per quarter?
---
Theoretically it's the "overflow while you wait for your queued WvW map" area. Except it went through "rewards should be hard" and "you need to play for the mechanics and not shiniest" phase. It would be nice if eotm was a staging ground for alliances. Just make rewards the same, and see if short matchup makes some people happier. But probably nope.
---
already seen thsi graph being used on social media out of context
---
You're not wrong. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chair
---
Anything but sitting on a chair in a game... 
---
Make it a BR (Battle Royale) mode mapp  üòâ

/s, right?
---
amazing work!
---
"you have two whole dodges! You should be fine! Get good!"
---
And then later: "stupid pve players are ignoring all the new fractals, wtf! Don't they want to spend 45+ minutes on each fractal?! Mechanics is fun!"
---
* Change IH so that either clones no longer do ambush attacks, or only do ambush attacks when you do.
---
* Change IH so that clone ambush attacks do not apply any conditions or CC or boons, and only cause a minor amount of damage.
---
* Remove ability to dodge while CCed (but can still dodge while immobilized or attacking as usual).
---
* Replace most if not all of mirage's torment access with bleed, game mode-split the stacks so that they're not oppressive in pvp/wvw but still maintains dps in pve. 
---
* Change the trait in Chaos such that manipulations no longer grant reflect and do something else instead.
---
All meaningful changes/nerfs that have been suggested by mesmer mains who know what they're talking about. Anet absolutely has the resources/time to implement and test one or more of these changes and they're totally aware about the mirage complaints and have been for at least a month if not more. 
---
I wish it was brought back. Every time I replay the story on an alt I just stop after Clorr Island as it is effectively the end of order's storyline and I don't like to play literally same thing over and over and over again
---
Chronos will be nerfed in PvE. Mirages and scourges will be nerfed in PvP and WvW. Some of the scourge nerfs will hit PvE as well.
---
It's almost like chaos Chrono now :) all the boons for yourself, maybe occasional one or two for others

 - Releases a difficult dungeon with no variable difficulty levels where the only reward is a reskin of an old weapon set with low drop rate

‚ÄúNo one is doing this dungeon. People must hate dungeons.‚Äù
---
However, there still remains the question of "how far does the 'autoclicker' definition go if it also has to use the bundled skill to actually 'consume' the item". Also, even the new policy contradicts itself in regards to **auto**-clicking and **repeating** sets of actions. So... yeah.
---
Depends. If you are able to buy the expansion at some point later, I'd say that there is plenty to keep you occupied until then because you'll have the entirety of the core game available.
---
However, if you can't by the expansions at all, then I'd say it's not worth playing. I know many people would disagree, but there just isn't enough in the core game to hold long-term interest if you are unable to ever buy the expansions or Living World episodes.
---
What about the LS3 ones?
---
I disagree. 
---
Yeah i honestly belive that but you obviously do not so i leave you with your tinfoil have on and which you a plesent evening.
---
Because elixers only affect you. So you use B, U, H and elixer gun, take HGH and use the hammer. You have perm 25 stacks of might, high quickness, and high everything else. However, you provide no utility outside of CC, and you just smash things with your hammer lol. Moreover, if someone provides all those buffs to you, you have three wasted talent trees, a wasted heal slot, and 3 wasted utility slots. I mostly just play it to RP as an alchemist. Still fun in disorganized groups, and very fun while doing open world content that isn't zerg.

Sigh...

&gt;Why is Sample Size Important?  
---
&gt;Sample size refers to the number of participants or observations included in a study. This number is usually represented by n. The size of a sample influences two statistical properties: 1) the precision of our estimates and 2) the power of the study to draw conclusions. 
---

---
&gt; A sample size that is too small reduces the power of the study and increases the margin of error, which can render the study meaningless.

Look at that‚Äîyou broke Scruffy's sarcasm meters!
---
Eh i mean you are ofc free to feel that PoF is massive disapointment but do not pull me in to that, it was not what i wrote.
---
It's not being denied, but it's evident that new gimmicks aren't enough to keep the game afloat. The selling point of the expansion were the mounts but mounts alone don't make the game and if you compare what other AAA MMOs get with every expansion it put GW2 to shame.

Shared inventory slots are useful too 
---
Well, Warframe has been working as a Free to Play game with regular expansions and new content for long, so has PoE been.
---
I think the most disapointment on that paricular situation was the fact that it will not come to pc at all and only be on Mobile. 
---
Uhh...
---
Or just have a smidgen of self control?
---
Only to have her show up when the time is right...
---
Jesus, people keep commenting the same thing all over! In any case this achievement is unfun. It's about double clicking and pressing 1 1300 times. 
---
They balanced the trait a few months ago - before that, it was extremely powerful, as it was also paired with the holomancer on-dodge trait
---
Fair warning, I got a little too reliant on Graham's bubble and during one phase the NPC's all teleported to their spot to make the bubble and I couldn't find them again in time. So be ready to grab an updraft in case that happens.
---
At least they added chair in the Gemshop, now I wait that rope Gemshop item so I can finally got that gw2 experience.
---
You may want to consider an [Emperor tamarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_tamarin) for a [simian](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Cloudtouched_Simian)-inspired springer if you want an animal with a Fu Manchu mustache, and of course a [pug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pug) jackal, since it's [the most Canthan dog](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shing_Jea_Arena_\(outpost\)). 
---
As another comment pointed out. There was never going to be a balance patch today. We had a patch last week. Low effort as there is no reason to be waiting for a balance patch today and we already have posts showing off the chair.
---
Got my first pre drop at 5,8k hours and it was Venom^kill^^me^^pls
---
I had an awful time in Siren's Reef last night as a healer. My DPS was getting blown off the boat and dying in the water constantly. They weren't cleaving the adds so they just piled up. They were running away with the "stack together" green circle, and not running away with the "corrupted ground" red circle. They were doing 3k dps each.
---
I finally just thanked them for the group, swapped to a cleave-heavy dps class, joined a new group, cleaved all the adds down and easily beat the encounter.
---
It's not a hard fight. It's just a personal-responsibility boss for the DPS players. If they are garbage, you cannot succeed. Your DPS has to be able to juggle cleaving and avoiding obvious floor AoEs, that's all. Unfortunately, you cannot carry people through this fractal, so it requires some hard choices: either politely leave failing groups, or kick players who cannot avoid AoEs or fail to do high cleave damage.
---
Don't forget the Enrage that instakills most PUg groups when you got the boss &lt;50% :&gt;

Strange setup, but spares the druid from GotL
---
What the fuck are **you** going on about?  I'm having a debate about this BS.  Would you prefer I just roll over and say "golly, you're right!"?  
---
&gt; For many players, "fun" comes from being part of a group of social players with whom they have interactions.  
---
I don't care.  Really.  For some folks,"fun" is gawking at their Malibu Kasmeer.  It doesn't matter.  You define what's fun for you.  If that's the social interaction, great.  Whatever.    
---
I'll say it again:  it either works for you and you're having fun, or not.  
---
ANet has a responsibility to produce a game.  That's it.  That's all.  Their parameters for production may not match your idea of fun; too bad.  Their parameters for production may not match most of their player base's idea of fun; too bad for everyone, since they'll be out of business soon if that's the case.  
---
What they absolutely don't have responsibility for is **making** [you happy](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3hlree).  
---
Should they try to find a successful production strategy?  Duh!  Yes!   Can they execute better?  Of course!   
---
Does that mean you should abdicate responsibility for your own entertainment?  Heck no!
---
I haven't seen anyone getting them from S3/S4 trinkets, tho.
---
Ascended backs and trinkets bought from living world vendors or obtained from living world collections  often just give that season's currency. 
---
I had my first pre drop 2 days ago during the oil event at Thunderhead Peaks. It was Howl. I use Druid and Tempest, both, so it's a decent fit, but I wasn't planning on making Howler.
---
Took me over 9k and it was [Venom](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Venom_(weapon)\)
---
Same. Except it was 9k hours and I already had Kraitkin :D
---
holy shit these are great, I would spend a stupid amount of money for the lion griffon
---
I need that.. rabbit.
---
Oof xD
---
Played 10,500hrs before my first precursor drop :3 
---
Not always true. There are numerous examples of companies laying off tons of employees when profits are at their height. BuzzFeed is a good example. 
---
I had an extremely rare drop last week: a black lion key
---
I got a revive orb and a crafting materials bag.
---
My first pre was Lover from AC. My second pre was another Lover 30 minutes later from same dungeon. 
---
I bet it was less likely than winning 500 million dollars. Sad Panda.
---
Do you have a specific link for YT that you recommend watching? Thanks.
---
I'll run with your premise and actually go over the objectives, starting with alpine. You write off south towers and I would class those on the easier side, Bay is a piece of Swiss cheese that can be attacked from practically every direction and once you get to inner you can just go into lord room and know your back is safe. Both Hills and north-east tower are an absolute pain to attack if anyone shows up to defend them. Once you can get just outside the lord room in each you can control the fight. It's just a nightmare to get to that point.
---
I would also class Garri as hard since all three south gates are death traps, by the time you get to the north gates you've already had to walk strait past enemy spawn so you get gankers running back and eventually taking out your siege. You could treb from one of the north towers which is a good piece of map design, but since we're talking about "how WvW actually works" I'll have to point out that anyone bothering to do this is a rare occurrence. Once you're in lord room the defenders can engage and disengage much more easily than you and can run back quickly. Nice if you want to "farm plebs" but a pain if the defenders are half decent.
---
So for medium difficulty objectives we're left with north-west tower, and on that one commanders almost always cata or treb from north just to stop defenders hitting them strait from spawn, and if you are scouted on the way you have to get through a horrible choke point to get up there.
---
For desert border both north towers are nicer to attack for a start. They each have several directions to attack from and defenders just can't glide straight in to them. Also once you are inside each one has ample room to fight inside of if you choose to disengage the lord, and these tower lords aren't enough to swing a fight anyway unless both sides are fairly evenly matched already.
---
I would also say that Air Keep is arguably medium difficulty. Getting through outer can be done in a number of different ways, some of which are very difficult to counter. Once inside there are several areas where you can stake favourable ground to fight defenders and some pretty good cata spots to force your way to inner. The lord is quite a pain to deal with, but you can stake a good spot on the front stairs to damage the lord, avoid the doughnut of death, and then jump down into the area below to fight any defending group before reengaging the lord. Fire keep is a similar story except for inner being more difficult to siege your way through, though there is still a nice courtyard to cata from and fight inside.
---
That leaves Earth keep which I'll concede is not a fun place to fight. If I will give some defense of it though, the walls at the lord fuck over both sides equally and once you get up there you actually control the points of entry unlike Garrison. Still, I think the progression of south towers, north towers, air keep, fire keep makes for a more steady and mixed ramp up of difficulty if this is how we measure "objectively" good map design. They also have more spacious and varied areas inside to have a fight once you have managed to generate it.
---
**Moving on**, a very significant amount of the fights I have in both maps do take part outside of the objectives, particularly in the south of the map. Not because we whisper enemy commanders but because groups do in fact run around the map looking to fight groups they come across. For fights such as these, there are a number of great areas in desert border to come across another group and have it out. You might argue that top guilds are less likely to have others want to fight them like this, but this is how most of my fights against GvG guilds have actually happened. The idea of them attacking objectives to make for even fights is nice and I wish they would actually do that.
---
The areas around south-west camp on desert has several areas for a fight to move into, each of which with other ways round behind. South camp has more room than on alpine. The south camps on alpine both have a very strict choke points which can now be alleviated by necro portals, but they only existed years after desert was written off anyway. North east camp on desert has no open area but there is always multiple quick ways around each point another team can hold. Battle areas such as this make pirate ship metas somewhat less oppressive than a strait open field or a choke point, since you can more easily manoeuvre yourself into range without eating attacks on the way. Both north towers have areas south of them that are similar to this too.
---
The east side of the ruins on alpine are better than anything in oasis on desert which is one thing alpine has going for it. North camp on alpine with an area in the middle and several houses around it is a great layout for an area, and then you have to deal with people infinitely contesting from spawn instead of fighting you properly. On desert north camp is a more awkward platform to stand on, but you can at least stop people running in to contest it and can jump down easily at any time.
---
**TL;DR**; I disagree that desert border has no progression from easy to difficult objectives, both in terms of difficulty to siege and defenders advantage when fighting inside. I also believe that many areas of the map make for better and more varied areas to fight in once you have managed to come across or generate a fight.

if the new fractals take you longer than the old ones it literally is a question of getting good

I've had two in two years, and they were really cheap ones like 40g. So yay minor gold influx but it must be nice to find something really valuable

The dragon-turtle actually exists in the Guild Wars lore as one of the celestial bosses of the Nahpui Quarter mission, so it would fit in Canthan/Celestial themed mounts.

Mistlock sanctuary is so good!

Interesting.  Does it at least still give you the buff?  I may have been wasting fireworks if not...

Same, never got a pre. Got a BL key once close to launch and once again last week. No good drops in the middle. Some day!!
---
Yeah, sutgon.5402
---
Well, nothing was said about it being on Tuesday - it might as well be announced on Thursday's WvW stream.
---
Why did Anet say there would be a WvW announcement today can you find me anything thats has a dev saying "we have a WvW announcement next Tuesday". All we know is that its coming this week for all we know it could be announced on their weekly WvW streams or announced in a blog before that stream and then the devs discuss it on the stream.
---
And golden and love wings are reskin of the falcon(?) wing.

Pugged in on t4 last night and and 2 shot it with one player never doing it before. Way easier than when outflanked was the instability, that was whack

Wow crazy, I also got a pre drop during the oil meta (chaos gun). Also no intention to craft it :p

---
You're right. Upon re-watching they said "next week". I guess Tuesday is the day that we usually get news/patches/announcements. I don't think it was an unreasonable leap to make
---
No shit when tetris on game boy color has more updates than this dogshit.
---
Okay, I agree it'd be meaningful. However, has Anet's track history shown they are willing to do things like this? They'll nerf one thing then buff 2 others. The power component tacked onto most of Mirage's (a condi class) abilities are even higher than a lot of power DPS classes abilities. The people downvoting me are ignorant to trends and Anet's track record when it comes to dealing with this outlier class. 
---
One time i dreamt that we got a separate hairstyle choice for wearing a hat/helm. i was beyond happy that morning. an actual collab like this would bring me to tears.
---
You're right. They did say next week. Tuesday tends to be news/patch/update day, but that doesn't mean later in the week won't happen
---
Yes, you can.
---
I don't really mind the wvw hype. Who cares if it's only Tuesday and we gotta wait, just give us something at some point

*does more crack*

i've been with BOMB BP TSO DNT KRT CoSa I adore the WvW community and GvGing is a very friendly amazing environment.

A part of it is their own fault. Both Guild Wars 2 and WoW try to monetize the artificial barriers that inhibit socializing through server transfer fees. They try to cash out that you might want to play with a particular set of people. They've worked around this by allowing people to play in shared instances, but because it's still present, they are still inhibiting the establishment of long term social relationships within the game.
---
Are you talking about Path of Fire? Because I haven't bought it yet and this gives me the impression that it's probably not worth buying. So is it actually like that?
---
two wrong doesn't make one right
---
The wiki discussion drop rate research has someone claiming they got it from a Blood Ruby Amulet from ls3e1
---
My memory of southsun - running around in a giant zerg only go get one-shot by invisible karka.
---
I got double rewards tho
---
I‚Äôm talking about the living story season that is ongoing. The expansion is worth 20-30 bucks for the elite specializations and the mounts. The 5 zones are nice but there isn‚Äôt a reason to spend a lot of time in most of them. 
---
Play on holo. Actually makes it bearable and quite fun, since you can AOE the world. Only wiped once this week.
---
 Next week, not necessarily Tuesday 
---
&gt; I only manage to open half a stack in the golden second
---
"Half a stack", omg, I think game can only open like 20 using its "use all" command. :(
---
Buy the episode you get all the story content with the episode that includes achievements
---
No need to be hostile, but thanks for the info :)
---
Tyvm
---
you are technically correct... the best kind of correct
---
Forearmed is Forewarned is a part of the episode
---
Well your probably the 10th person to mention a patch today and the announcement it can get tiring.
---
Brand the middle put in a few random branded mobs/branded lost souls.
---
Then maybe have kralkatorrik fly in once in a while, maybe eat some magic 
---
And fix the pip's and rewards for Edge of the Mist.
---
What do You do with spare money? Spend it on whatever...
---
Tbh while I'd consider myself being a story person, I find the GW2 pretty boring. Too much boring hero clich√© stuff, nothing to discover.
---
I recently aquired GW1, do you think it's worth the time playing it?
---
Thanks, my AHK scripting is rusty :3
---
I add sleeps in between most inputs nowadays out of habit - too many times I had something not triggering elsewhere just because the script went too fast. Maybe that's something to do with the input mode, maybe that's not needed for GW2 - dunno; stuff can sure be tidied up, but "hack at it just till it works for the task at hand" is a decent enough approach for me :3
---
Which bring us back to my first comment.
---
&gt;Because dragons necessarily need wings, because without they are no dragons, right?
---
Mordremoth isn't the problem here, the problem is that Mordremoth's form doesn't fit in *your* idea of an "perfect Elder Dragon". He fits very well into the jungle theme and he looks draconic. And only because he has no wings and claws, he is "no real dragon" for *you*. But you basically said it yourself. 
---
&gt;Given the criteria that I used for my preference of what I usually see as draconic,
---
You're talking about your opinion, not about facts. 
---
Tbf I was expecting some fat juicy article about a new map/new features for WvW today as well, but rewatched the twitch thingy again.
---
I highly recommend just grabbing a few random people who are willing to help take the hall.  I want to say they don't even have to be in your guild, but it's been over a year since we took ours so I am not sure.  10-15 people is probably a good number as long as they all are comfortable with their builds (i.e can run around open world expansion areas without dying excessively).
---
You're right but that's not a very productive statement which is why I think people would downvote you...as if reddit comments necessarily need be productive... 
---
&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aotqdr/wvw\_announcement\_next\_week/
---
that fractal and deepstone feel like they were also designed by some intern. bland, too easy and no depth.
---
Sounds like amazing fun and as always, thanks for your hard work Roy :)
---
Is bringyourfriends not a mesmer main who knows what he's talking about? Perhaps you know more? Please share - what nerfs, changes and buffs would you like to see?
---
Most ambitious crossover yet?
---
I'm throwing in 20k gems for the winning team, sign up boys
---
i was saying that first day he left :(
---
Unlike a lot of other games where the build customization comes with skills, this game it is more in your traits and gear. You do get 5 skills you can pick freely based on your class, but a majority of the changes are made in traits and gear. 
---
I'm here for the five'o'clock free crack give-a-away
---
Is this the real exiting wvw announcement? :D
---
The gold per hour was on par for what you can make in istan now.  And there were plenty of casual runners when lfg was populated.  The toxicity comes with any online community, but your example of necro/ranger hate boils down to a balance problem and not a specifically dungeon problem.
---
&gt; That was my point from the beginning.
---
No you never mentioned that... 
---
You always talked about it as an fact, not as your own opinion. You took "traditional western dragons" to compare the shapes and never said anything about your own thinking/opinion.
---
&gt;All of the other dragons have draconic physical forms. They hold true to the idea of Elder Dragons. Mordremoth is comparative for power in his own sphere of magic and nature, but lacks the form that literally every other one has. 
---
&gt;Even then, compared to the others, he lacks wings, forearms with claws, etc. Zhaitan, Primordus, Kralkatorrik all fit the description of traditional western dragon much more nicely.
---
&gt;Mordremoth was literally just a fat, oversized normal looking mordrem with no defining features or traits.
---
&gt;Doesn't matter either way, my original point is that neither the avatar within the dream or the Mouth look draconic in comparison to all other Elder Dragons.
---
"in comparsion to all other Elder Dragons". Nothing about your own opinion, only an objective statement.
---
&gt;Using the others as a baseline, no, it still doesn't make sense or follow any line of logic for how Mordremoth looks. Whether intentional or an oversight, due to how he looks within the universe when stacked up to all other Elder Dragons, he doesn't give off the same vibe, especially during the story instance, so people took issue with it. 
---
Ofcourse you can check your own comments yourself. You *never* mentioned your own opinion, in no single comment. You *always* made your statements objective, made comparsions and so on. Nothing about your subjective opinion.
---
What would you prefer they switch to...? 
---
Skills 1-5 are tied to the weapon(s) you're wielding, while the 6-0 skills can be freely selected from a list.
---
Every class uses weapons differently though. There couldn't be more difference in the ways that warrior and mesmer use greatsword, for example. It does limit the variety of 1-5 skills you can get, but that won't ever change.
---
Besides, I've seen enough mmos that just grey out [shoot arrow] skills if I don't have a bow equipped, and they just end up as screen clutter. I'd much prefer the clean UI we have here instead.
---
It would be fun to play new expansion for a while.  And then the cycle would repeat itself: new ls releases coupled with gemstore skins. Meh.
---
You should for ANet! I would gladly pay 2000 gems PER mount skin that you designed... all of them
---
Except for revenant, they just get full preset packages there. 
---
I mean I'm a big fan of the game and played it like 15 years ago so there is nostalgia attached.
---
I would say the worst part of the game is the price. It's really expensive for how old it is. I can't really explain to you what you're in for because it's unlike other MMOs, I would compare it to Dragon Age Origins but with multiplayer and a worse story (not bad but DAO is amazing).
---
Combat is very deep and the game can be entirely soloed (even the hardest stuff, though it'll be harder using AI partners over humans, you can setup your AI to do exactly what you want and completely build them yourself).
---
They appeae to have meant a year of consecutive quarters that were lower than this quarter. 
---
First, unedited comment, last sentence. " That's why ***I think*** people took issue with it"
---
I've never understood why people have issue with this. If I wanted gear to be purely cosmetic I would play something like WoW. 
---
Wielding a sword or dagger but strictly casting fireballs as your attacks doesn't make a lot of sense. 
---
&gt; The gold per hour was on par for what you can make in istan now. 
---
And there were less sinks. Come on man. And were dungeons UNCLEARABLE on Rangers/Necros because of balance?
---
Anyone who likes Siren's Reef likes raids. Anyone who doesn't do raids, like me, dislike Siren's Reef. 
---
You forget the part where the drop rates were abysmal, and afking at the svanir shaman was ten times more profitable than wasting a single minute of your life at the dungeon.
---
Geez, I wonder why no one played it.
---
I fully agree here. I have 8k achievement points on my core account. The only up i got is that i have upgraded it from f2p to core with those keys anet gave as promo. And still not close to be done with most of content , for example fractals im still on t2.
---
It's genuinely the only logical combo!
---
Procedural path obstacles means you have a series of tunnels, and each run a few of them are closed, forcing you to explore instead of following the same path every time.
---
The problem with swamp and the rest was that it was the same thing again and again.
---
I enjoy the bit where you hit the thing
---
&gt; a reskin of an old weapon set with low drop rate
---
I didn't forget ;(
---
Also, remember all the development time that went into the useless bonus objectives after the last boss?
---
That turtle and that rooster-raptor
---
For the Jackal I would've gone for a chinese dog breed, personally. Imagine a Chow Chow made of sand!
---
Wow, that looks amazing. You could make some $$ on these!
---
Oooh ! Amazing work !
---
The fish rots from... The Living Story? ü§î
---
Gonna be fun.
---
That looks amazing. Do you have any progress pictures to show how you made it?
---
It's the game's endgame rewards, like it or not. You aren't forced to follow that endgame though, and you can just play for fun. However, fun is not part of any endgame, it's just you and your free will alone, it's not wrong/right, it's just fun.
---
Problem is, we barely have any fun content either. PvE is far too easy, repetitive, and grindy, and PvP takes itself too seriously while not balancing properly.
---
Maybe they should make a deal with Netflix?
---
Oh wait, I think only marvel series are allowed to be shit in there... 
---
You know we already have these, right? Only that we have dailies for all maps available at once, and they don't have any decent rewards.
---
Reduce that to a daily rotation from each expansion's and LW's maps, and we're good to go. Example of a potential rotation: Auric Basin, Ember Bay, Domain of Vabbi, Sandswept Isles. There you go.
---
Assuming they can even make it to the office for a stream. It's a couple days out, but the current forecast is calling for more snow in Seattle Thursday morning.
---
Support Chrono gives alacrity and quickness and other boons, regardless of whether or not you're tanking. Tanking just means you have the highest toughness stat to keep boss aggro (or take the special fixation mechanic or whatever.)
---
Power Chrono on SC is a DPS build. Your role is to DPS. 
---
Condi chrono is a support chrono that deals condition damage, and most groups will never really need them or bitch if you don't have one in my experience.
---
As for mirage, yes. They're better on some bosses, power is better on others, this information is literally all on the SC website if you actually read instead of clicking through each page for 3 seconds.
---
It was an advice and a personnal point of view. No offense.
---
When will this be exactly? How many hours?
---
They weren't a big deal and that's what's sad. The developers can't be bothered to divert their development resources to meaningful content. Instead it's wasted on stuff like that.
---
Neat designs, but not what I'd want from a LNY mount skin pack. I'd want mounts designed in the style of the GW1 Celestials, like the celestial rooster glider is:

GW1's story is Lord of the Rings, while GW2 is a Marvel movie.
---
You'll like it a lot. Have patience with the gameplay, it's hard to get into when you start.
---
only Anet knows 
---
If you're using Windows 10, files in the default Program Files folder, which is typically where your game files and ArcDPS are kept, requires direct administrative access to edit. When launching Guild Wars 2, make sure to launch as Administrator in order for ArcDPS' settings to be changed.
---
Tbh announcing an announcement, and with a fix date is a kinda shitty move
---
That should have been a boss gauntlet dungeon instead of a story instance.
---
Do you sell those? You should, it's really beautiful *_*
---
It made me chuckle and brightened my day. 
---
now slap it on etsy
---
I mean you said it has all permissions,but still try to run gw2 on admin when doing the change as that mostly helps as it did in my case (otherwise it wont even allow to change the build templates even).
---
Thank you! Unfortunately I did not make progress pictures. I used wire, floral tape, mulberry paper and ink based colors. An acrylic lacquer coat gives the petals and leaves a glasslike texture.
---
1 pre in 6k hours here, and it was the energizer, the cheapest non-aquatic one :P
---
I'm curently checking my awefull screenshots to share it and advertise here again. ;-)
---
I've been opening smaller amounts at 685% magic find. I have five accounts so I've just been opening the ones you can buy daily once a week three times over. So a total of 1680 envelopes. My magic find increased to 697% over the course of the event but the difference is marginal. I've averaged 35% profit from trophies only (I've not sold food or backpack items) - that is, each envelope worth 1.35g in trophies. I peaked at 1.41g per envelope in trophies, but I had a bad batch on the last \~100 that was only 1.13g per envelope.
---
So I don't doubt it that you could get a profit of 45% on 962% magic find.
---
That is something I cannot understand.
---
They were selling expansions. It was their obvious money maker as clearly shown by their financial statements.
---
Now they are going to give it away for free and its to be the same quality and scope? 
---
I don't buy it. 
---
Thank you :) As an artist I also sell some of my projects.
---
Thank you, I am glad you like it :D
---
Thank you so much :) It was fun to craft this one.
---
Thank you! I am happy you like it :D
---
Pog
---
PoF is completely worth the price, specially if you like the game.
---
It's just too short-lived for what people expect from MMO content.
---
there was sexy armor pieces there was warbeast light and sunspear light on male. mmmm
---
Most boring raid boss ever
---
Can you stop telling other people what to say and think? *Gosh.*
---
Oh, right! Woops.
---
Fair enough. Though I'd argue that hadn't it been of GW2 always trying to change and innovate, we wouldn't have gotten the LS3-4 living story format, nor mounts. So it's a double-edged sword, really.
---
this is why anet needs to make a dating sim so i can marry faren. cant you guys see the numbers!!!
---
With 963% MF, the return from trophies is 1.39g, each time I tried on previous years, 3 out of 4 times this year\*, and in reddit posts from people with similar MF.
---
So you need a higher-than-normal batch or more MF to reach 1.45g.
---
\* the 4th time was today, I opened 1036 envelopes and only got 1.28g return from trophies. Trust me I checked my MF (963) a million times, I checked that no trophies got hidden in some invisible inventory slots another million times, and I recalculated a million times both from the difference of money in my wallet and from the total of trophies in vendor's cancel tab. After a while I had to give up : I somehow actually got 1.28g/envelope return on a whole 1000+ envelopes batch, despite knowing that it's more than enough envelopes to ensure an average result (all other results that I know of with similar MF are around 1.39g with nearly no variation -maybe +/-2s max- , it's beyond me how I got a 11s variation).
---
Thursday. 2:30 PM PDT or later.
---
It's almost like there is a majority feeling that they are a terrible addition to the game....
---
The Raptor and Skimmer are the best. We need more Skimmer skins that aren't boring.
---
God, I love the good old jade maw fractal. The new ones are tedious as fuck
---
Commenting so I can remember when I am not at work. Been trying to pick a main for awhile and Mesmer just feels so right. 
---
They wonder why there Q4 was down....
---
I was curious so I put Kralkatorrik's head on the body of the Shatterer to figure out how he might look like
---
Yeah that skritt skin LOL
---
I actually genuinely enjoy Siren's Reef. I think it's a very fun fractal! The chest throwing mechanic is enjoyable, and I love the sense of needing to stick together and work together to gather the treasure at the end and not get pushed out into the dangerous areas beyond the ship. That urgency to avoid getting overwhelmed is reminiscent of zombie games/films (example [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkJGmsvmqKs) from TWD that it reminds me of).
---
HOWEVER, that being said, I do think it's too long. A lot of sections can be shaved and streamlined:
---
- Removing the mobs before the first mini boss.
---
- Despawning all mobs when the maze is completed.
---
- Adding a checkpoint near the new singularity when the maze is completed.
---
- Despawning any mobs that are currently on the ship when a ship boss spawns at the end.
---
I don't necessarily think they should make it easier, but the above changes should make it less frustrating and more streamlined.
---
Play another 10.000 hours. Than you can start complaining. ;D
---
dragon-turtle. closest thing to dragon I guess.
---
I'm starting to feel the same. What's the point of a new map every episode when there is hardly enough events to do in them? These beautiful new maps just simply don't have enough content. Go back to the core hot maps and there was events around every corner...these new ones are sparse as hell!
---
Cute. :)
---
could you imagine... it would be utter chaos. the CC, barrier, movement speed. it would literally kill WvW
---
You might be onto something here.
---
It would also be nice for things like the collections for Frostfang where you have to go to places on the map and double click on an item in my inventory. Having it on a hotbar or a hotkey would have made that less annoying.
---
I still don't even know how to get the standard chair novelty unlocked &gt;_&lt;
---
It's not a question though.
---
I would definitely try it out on this computer, but just want to add that if you do enjoy it and can afford something better down the road it‚Äôs definitely worth it.
---
The landscapes and detail in this game are gorgeous, and it‚Äôs worth running it on a decent rig to see all it has to offer.
---
Yep, if you press H and go to the achievements panel, there should be a place in the collections section for "specialization collections".  It's basically a bunch of stuff you have to do in either Heart of Thorns or Path of Fire, and at the end of it you get an ascended weapon.  For example, the Guardian's longbow is called [Ydalir](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ydalir_(achievement).  These are really good because even if the stats on them aren't what you want, with ascended weapons and armor you can actually fairly cheaply change the stats on them using an [Anthology of Heroes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Anthology_of_Heroes).
---
Like what Lorkdemper said below, I strongly recommend buying or crafting a combination of Marauder's and Berserker's gear.  They listed a bunch of super good ways to cheaply get gear, definitely look into those. 
---
Bon from stardust. Makes light. That makes sense. :)
---
Blowing job! ("awesome" was already used by others redditers). I want a new light on my desk now.
---
Many Elites have core mechanics changed or have significant additions to alter gameplay.
---
DH's Virtues are now effect spells along with passives, Firebrand's Tomes.
---
Berserker's Berserk mode and Primal Bursts, Spellbreaker's Full Counter.
---
Druid's Celestial Avatar, Soulbeast's Beast mode, both used and focused heavily when considering the profession.
---
Chrono's Alacrity abilities, Wells, 5th Shatter which resets spells, Mirage's Cloak, Ambush attacks, Melee Condi playstyle.
---
Daredevil's extra Endurance charge, Brawler playstyle, Skills tied into Evades, Deadeye's Stealth mechanics with Rifle, stupid stealth roll, Malice Stealth attacks, altered Stolen skills and Mark.
---
Reapers have a significantly altered Shroud, most abilities changed to melee, exceptional melee damage, and an astonishing amount of Chills in the kit along with the Vulnerability application, Scourges lose Shroud for Sand Shades and barriers, and uses Life force for ammo to cast their Shroud skills which are now non toggle and available all the time. 
---
For Scrapper, the reason why it's not popular nor is it unique enough, is because all yu have access to is now a Hammer, and 5 new skills and 5 new toolbelts.
---
That's it! Like that's literally it!
---
Trait wise, it all revolves around passive play with alot of bunkering traits, or lots of Stability with the Hammer, which tbh is a very boring weapon which has too many defensive capabilities, but nothing to support a Scrapper's melee playstyle.
---
Especially when compared to Holosmith, which has Heat, Photon Forge, 
---
What yur introducing with this concept, is essentially giving Thief expanded Stolen skills, with probably a traitline just as similarly boring as that.
---
Core thief + more stolen skills is essentially the same hole Scrapper has fallen into, being that it's basically a Core Engi + 5 (or 10, counting toolbelt) new skills, not altered core mechanic, and no new additional mechanics or style change. 
---
Oh, CA, I know how you feel. I do the same thing to my desk when my tea goes cold during escort and THEN we wipe. 
---
Bitch, please.

Isn't it lovely what happens with 1-time content that anet doesn't come back to after initial release? Top notch.
---
You're right.  We are talking about pre HoT gw2.  Nowadays necro and ranger are in a great spot balance wise and if they had been like that during the dungeon era then they wouldn't have been so hated.
---
this is wrong though, using GoE before stacking might is how you tilt all the dps in your group

Oh my lord.

---
I really like the rooster (maybe my frenchie side speaking here). The turtle is an awesome idea! But above all the springer mustache &lt;3
---
I guess it's clear enough thanks to the OP's edit.
---
It seems you didnt really read my question properly. I didnt ask what a condi chrono or power chrono does, it's implied in the name. I asked what LFG groups are referring to when they ask for an off chrono.   
---
Just to make my question CLEAR, if the LFG says "Looking for off chrono", what build should I be running.  
---
As for my condi mirage question, I asked because I actually have read up on it and some people say it's good some not. There is NO power mirage build on snowcrows, only condi.  
---
I'm sure I could've articulated my question better, I do know mesmer's roles in raids, I dont know what off chrono is referring to. 
---
Yup, definitely agree. We had sloppy first try because we thought it's going be THAT bad, but it seems that with enough projectile hate and pulls last phase is piss easy. Unless you eat each wind.
---
That's not sadness. That's wistful at most.
---
Wait until you go past 16K with no pres like some of us.
---
My grip with the birds is, WHY THOSE JUVENILE ONES ARE SPAWNED WHEN YOU DODGE??
---
Like, the descriptions says, you get the birds, then you waste a dodge to get rid of them and transfer to enemies, but instead you get punished more because the game spawn 4 juvenile birds that constantly blind you and deal more damage than the ones you have to dodge.
---
I know, you can kill them, but using Siren's Reef as an example, you already have a boss, toons of AoEs an ground stuff, tons of elite and veteran mobs to deal with, then you waste a dodge only to spawn more mobs to deal with.
---
For me they need to remove the Juvenile Birds and it would become a normal, balanced instability.
---
7th year is running, do you honestly think they will be pumping out content for a few more years? They have already dropped 2 major game modes, 3rd mode is on life support as content teams were "merged" and cadence of release far from goal line. People are blind to see they are only milking them via Gemstore while LW stories are there to cater to the most casual player. 
---
Definitely looks like it's your CPU (every time your CPU hits 100%, you'll notice some kind of stutter or lag, either in game or on your desktop). I would give overclocking a try. 
---
You might also try a different browser, it does make a difference on some rigs.
---
Super happy with how it came out too. Love the art style /u/primordialtrade !
---
I wish I had the skills to do something cool like this. The coolest skill I have is I can make a water drop noise with my mouth. 
---
Hmmm... i reckon is a Journeyman recipe..Crafting materials consist of Journeyman's Ink Set, Sheet of Smooth mulberry Paper, Intricate Scribe's Tools, Aluminum ingot 
---
So I finally began crafting after watching a few videos and following [gw2craft.ne](https://gw2craft.net)t. My issue right now is that my inventory is filling up with all of this gear from the recipes I've made / discovered. Can I toss / sell / salvage them? Or is the gear used as part of recipes down the road?

Note that this is not something new of Windows 10. It started being this way since XP (but in XP you had admin privileges by default). Starting from Windows Vista you don't have admin privileges by default as long as you have UAC enabled.

Hi, i crafted it with wire, mulberry paper, floral tape, cardboard, different inks, copic markers and an acrylic varnish as a finishing coat. The acrylic varnish gives the petals and leaves the glasslike effect. :)
---
Gorgeous!!
