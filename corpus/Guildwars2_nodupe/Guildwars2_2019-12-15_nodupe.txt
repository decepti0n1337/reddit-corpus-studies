There's also an "image" component here. From the frontpage of reddit you might think people were only doing random and nice looking things with this bug, but in game I was seing more and more penises and svastikas, and I probably missed some similar things.
---

---
At this point, if Anet had decided to let it happen even though they had a kill switch available, I assume they would have been liable.
---
---
---
Words evolve. Triggered in online, and some casual real life interactions has come to mean frustrated or annoyed. 
---
It’s like with the word literally where it has come to mean both literal as well as can be used for emphasis.
---
The English language in particular is cool like that. With so many different cultures using it we get some really interesting words and meanings.
---
Also don’t be part of the grammar police. Reddit is a form of informal discussion where slang and imperfect English should be expected.
---
I want to point out that you can't actually get 6 on the rings until you've got enough agony that you likely have close to a full set.
---
Yes, I love the sense of adventure and danger. I recently had to briefly return to PvE to get a legendary weapon and I actually enjoyed doing the HoT completion stuff.
---
WAAAAKKKEE UUUUPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WvW, Anet cares nothing about you, your guild or the love you have for the game. They killed the game. PVE get's it all, they are the ones dishing out the money for gems and the blt. The alliance system is just talk to get people to hold on to a dying game. If they cared about what people want, they would have already fixed the broken game. We started with 24 servers, now there's 12, come soon it'll probably be 6. Across the server's the WvW community has lost a lot of great player's, excellent fight guild's, because no-one at Anet/NcSoft wants to hear idea's, or explanations that could help the game. The release of GW2 trailer in the beginning was all about WvW, people were hyped. Then came the player's that wasn't good at WvW, INCLUDING ANET employee's, crying it's not fair, it's to hard, and 7 yrs later here we are in the midst of a dying game. I've moved on to other games, but I still have hope, that one day, somebody will figure it out and repair the game. GL to all WvW'ERS
---
Yeah.
---
They came up with boons so we would not have a hundred separate enchantments competing with each other.
---
If they then start making unique effects that stack with boons, then people will obviously bring them instead talking with each other to see who brings what, then fill the rest of the utility slots with more varied and useful skills instead more stacking passive stuff.
---
Exactly
---
That has been that way for ages.
---
Playing as batman, slowing unlocking daredevil throughout HoT. By far my favorite maps.
---
Huh.
---
Alright, gonna give that a try if it happens again. Thanks, mate.
---
Right, sorry! I mixed it up with one of the other PoF materials, and apparently managed to just glide over that part of the wiki infobox! Thanks!
---
It's impossible to "carry," as you need to gather most of the stuff yourself. You can buy certain things on the trading post. Unless you mean portal you to the locations on the various maps?
---
can someone explain what the bug is that has started this whole banner thing?
---

---
Maybe it's finally over since they were disabled
---
[removed]
---
Rub 'em
---
there is no proper answer if thats what you mean, as long as you answer all 3 with whatever random one you choose, it should be good. it is only the cheev that requires you to answer in different combinations.
---
As others have said, it's not really "carryable". If you don't feel that an unlock buddy would be reasonable due to playtime restrictions, focus on breaking it down into smaller bits - don't even look at all of it, just the section you're on at the moment!
---
The first few steps are basically a couple circuits around Dragonfall - take it one step at a time, and keep a guide open.
---
Let it take time.
---
Not really a waste since banners are literally the strongest personal DPS boosts for warriors, even though they are 10-target support skills.
---
Balance is a joke.
---
o3o
---
Simply put..Yes, all classes get more exciting later on. For Ranger...Druid and Soulbeast are both very fun to play if you enjoy supporting allies or doing lots of damage. GW2 starts out very slow, gradually getting faster paced until you reach level 80. I've played quite a bit of both ranger and thief, the elite specs make the classes so much more fun. For now, just figure out which one has the more appealing build for your playstyle and go for max level on that one.
---
Sometimes you have to answer the last question again as you don’t get the buff.
---
Been saying this since it came out, but it's a rather new "accepted" opinion. Everyone hated them at first for some reason.
---
Which one would you say has the most potential for a mainly solo and casual player?
---
None of this necessarily applies to CMs. Heal scourge is not good as the only healer, but blood magic is a good sub for a dps player in groups where people keep dying, or groups with no healer. When pugging, this can happen fairly often, usually due to a below average healer and a bad instab combo. Obviously you mostly use reaper, but scourge can be a very good sub in the right situation.

Ah, tbh I don't think it's worth the extra trouble for like 100 extra DPS or however little it is.

Useful tip though! Thanks

Honestly was expecting a stream of players falling to their deaths.

*Blinks* wow.. someone fell for it lol
---
If you don't find any solution, create a Windows partition using Boot Camp if you have the space; will certainly increase frames

Ah, well it is still probably too early in the match to see how it will go.  Indo's back to train the pugs on FA now apparently.

"Not saying it's worth developing"
---
I'm not saying they could toss it in over night. I'm not even saying they should. Just saying it could be done, since everyone thinks it can't be on a technical level.
---
Flax farms may still be profitable.  If you have HoT and the LWS3 map, Draconis Mons, there are flax nodes in a few locations.  Under Jaka Itzel in Verdant Brink, above Ogre Camp in Tangled Depths and another in Draconis Mons:   [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Node\_farm](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Node_farm)

The end of the Sanctum of Nabkha mini-dungeon in Crystal Oasis has three chests you can loot once a day per account.

---
idk ive been sending a friend, who is taking a break form the game, 500 gold every week without any messages or titles including every new bl skin, new bl weapon sets etc.  since a few months now (because  said person is taking a break from the game for rl stuff so he only logs into the game to claim the gold and logs off with maybe 30 minutes playtime every week)
---
And neither of us has been banned yet.
---
But i am sure that Anet factors in more things when banning people, e.g. Who sends the gold, who receives the gold.  I mean, if an account that has been created 10 days ago suddenly starts sending you alot of gold, with IP-access from china. Of course that would seem suspicious.
---
Just look at all the streamers, teapot got ALOT of on-stream gold donations and I haven't seen him banned yet.
---
Pretty sure they made a mistake here and you might get unbanned when you contact support at some point.
---
My work made everyone do one of these things a while back. I got ISTP.
---
I play mirage mostly, but other classes depending on party need, ( healbrand, banners, holo, etc)
---
It wasn't a joke per se. Just pointing out that between the two games, ESO had it first. Even then, Guild Wars 1 had Ice Elementals before ESO. I was only talking about, very specifically, the two designs. I should have specified.
---
It's slower then GW2 for sure, but it's faster than that at endgame. You have oGCDs and GCD reductions.
---
And I have. Warrior too. I much prefer my keyboard and mouse, but you can use Xpadder to have it work basically just like FFXIV. I'm not saying it's ideal, I'm not saying they should do it. But it can be done, and works fairly well. You won't be unlocking God of the Arena with it, but if you wanted to run easier stuff? Yeah, works just fine.
---
HoT is like MoP of WoW, underappreciated at its time only for people to realize how magnificent it is later on.
---
Warrior is top dps *while* boosting everyone.
---
Can't we use Renegade Spirits as holo dancers, and Herald landmarks as disco pads?
---
Most likely due to skill lag :P
---
Here are a heap more:
---
When you do a whirl finisher inside the hitbox of your enemy, ALL of the projectiles will hit your foe instead of getting shot out randomly.
---
Skills that attack on block will fail to perform the flip animation when jumping, so that way you can block basically an unlimited number of hits with Ranger gs 4 or Mesmer sword 4 for example, just by jumping when getting hit.
---
Weapon swapping will cancel attack animations, but not when you swap them in your UI out of combat by dragging and dropping them into your current weapon slot (or build templates now lul)
---
Chrono shield 5 also destroys projectiles, very useful to remember.
---
Weapon swapping when using the soulbeast dash skill on gazelle will cause you to retain the cosmetic dash lines all the time without needing to use the skill.
---
Every strike on the revenant sword 3 is a teleport. That means if you use sword 3 on a Mesmer before they take their portal, you will essentially follow them through.
---
Moa on Mesmer can delete other transforms. For example if a warrior uses rampage, using moa on them will delete their rampage and turn them back to normal once moa form has ended.
---
Short duration dazes and stuns below 1s always round up to have the same breakbar damage as a stun or daze worth 1s.
---
A map-wide event that occurs every few hours; that how a lot of people gather in one place. You can find timers for every map in resources/wiki or just by googling.
---
I've got 2 alts parked on the Flax farm. Each holds 'Harvesting Sickle of Bounty'. It gives a 33% chance to be able to harvest the node again. 
---
The 33% chance refreshes everytime as far as I'm aware, but caps at 3 additional hits. So you can get a max if 4 harvests per Flax Node if you're lucky
---
Yeah I had this for the first time the other day, walked all the way back and then I got the buff
---
&gt;Thanks to even trash mobs with reflects and retaliation your days of no-thought shredding are numbered. You can build for sustain while keeping up the damage but it'll basically become a game of you getting good at kiting and then kissing dirt when you screw up.
---
A trait or traitline swap can make this kindof a moot point.  The fact is if you're having trouble with retaliation, especially in open world but elsewhere also, you're playing thief wrong.  They have mass boon theft with the correct traits and/or weapons.  Reflect can be an issue still of course, but that's what weapon swaps are for.  A Sword/Dagger thief has no issues with either.
---
&gt; If you drop bows and axes and go with the mele weapons you will be  putting yourself in harm's way more often and your pet will go from meat  shield to bonus damage. Soulbeast and Druid do require more thought and  skill but I find they were designed with very specific play styles and  roles in mind and gong against those is basically ice skating up hill. 
---
Axe can still kill plenty quick on Soulbeast, as can Longbow.  Druid is... I feel pretty rough to play as solo... it's survivable but its damage is just not great.  I compensate as best I can by running a bizarre stun/daze spam power melee build that at least has so much CC that things don't pose as much a threat for me sacrificing all my support abilities.  There are definitely things you can do with either that don't fit comfortably in to the "design" of the spec, though (You can pull off a very interesting life-steal spamming power Slb build that is surprisingly effective in many parts of the game, if not actually a "good" build).  From the way he was talking I'd assume he's not really looking at end game, but rather open world stuff.
---
No, it got put in the game when they introduced the "Banners cant be picked up too early" to fix the bug where if you picked banners up instantly you wouldn't get the CD reduction.
---
So like less than a week to find?
---
If it was from POF release it'd be anytime you mounted with banners down, but it was only within that 2 second window they introduced. 
---
Thats foolish to assume it wasnt JUST put in the game.
---
thank you! i hate when they misuse ptsd terminology, it trivialises trauma so much :/
---
Flax or the ghost area in pof with all the chests for unidentified gear.
---
I love that video xD

can someone link the original of that goose video?
---
Still waiting for people to change to the 4xDHs + 1xRenegade meta for fractals.
---
I feel like you won't able to see Kiel in Aetherblade related fractals, and Braham during Molten related fractals.
---
EDIT: I meant from the instability, since they are already part of the fractal story.
---
So I'd wanna do Axe,Sword or Mace/Dagger for dw?
---
I wasn't but now I am thanks to you...
---
Yea I'm a soulbeast, that's what I meant when I was asking if I was doing it wrong..
---
The animation blending makes this look so smooth!
---
Soulbeast allows you to merge with your pet and gain extra skills and stats. You don't *have* to use the new weapon option, this goes for all elite specs. They're additional options, not requirements.
---
You should also not be staying in merged form permanently unless you are in a raid. You want to weave in and out of merged form, use the skills then unmerge and let your pet tank.
---
Necromancer with shield, and Braham with off hand mace?  Most of the time I see him he has main hand mace and shield or bow. They even intentionally made sure the off hand mace was clear that it's off hand and not main hand made since he has no main hand weapon in that picture.
---
Give this a shot in your ranger:
---
Use axe/axe and greatsword, bird pets, and utilities of your choice. That should be a much faster paced setup. Birds do a huge amount of damage but have low health, so you have them do their pet skill, and then switch before it does to the other one and have it do it's skill, and so on.
---
This is not some kind of meta build by the way, it's just fun and totally great for open world and leveling.
---
I'm a long time player who has played a lot of ranger so happy to answer questions for you and give suggestions to make it more fun!
---
I want to see a hammer or pistol/pistol Necro. =)
---
I don't really care for raids or pvp.. I just want to stop dying all the time in PvE and story quests :(
---
Nostalgia is calling. Glad I wasn't the only one to pick it up.
---
First thing I'd suggest is getting full Berserker's gear.  You look to be using that on your accessories, but I can't be sure on the armour.  A relatively cheap option would be to buy the "Nika's" armour off of the trading post.  Will cost 1-2 gold per piece, but that's cheaper than crafting it, and it comes with decent runes already slotted.  Berserker's is the best gear in general for raw damage, and is easier to get than the best condition damage gear (Viper's).
---
Second, with that Berserker gear, you'll need to get the right weapons.  You'll also need Berserker weapons, so your options are greatsword, longbow, sword, off-hand axe.  Greatsword is a good option for melee, and longbow is a good option when you need to attack from range.
---
The reason you don't want to use dagger (main or off-hand), shortbow, and to an extent mainhand axe, is that they focus more on condition damage.  If you want to use those, you'll need to get gear that has good condition damage (Viper's is best, but Carrion/Dire/Rampager's can work, but I highly recommend just usinb Berserker gear/weapons instead).
---
For your skills, you'll want to avoid any that do damaging conditions such as bleed/poison, since those are mostly useless when using a Berserker setup.  Instead, you can use things such as Bear Stance (heals and cleanses conditions from you, but requires Soulbeast to be in your third specialisation slot), Quickening Zephyr (breaks stun and gives you superspeed and quickness), and Signet of the Wild (boosts the Ferocity of you and your pet, boosts the damage that your critical hits do, which will happen often in a Berserker setup).
---
Basically don't get stuff that has Toughness or Vitality, as the game tends to play better if you kill stuff before it kills you.  So go full Berserkers, and use your dodges and the blocks/evades (Greatsword 4 for example blocks attacks for a short while, and the auto attack for greatsword will restore some of your endurance, so you can dodge roll more often).
---
Then you shouldn't stay merged, use your pet to help you.
---
There's still a lot that you have to grasp about the combat and game design if you are struggling so I recommend looking up more online resources like I mentioned.
---
Yeah I feel it. Hopefully we get a longer one eventually.
---
I'm using Nika's gear. :/
---
oh cool!   
---
Can the Roleplayers have Shards that Dont' close every 4 Fucking seconds back now ?
---
/shuffle, you need the dance book from the gemstore for that emote.
---
just skimming through - i'm basically half asleep - and what struck me as quite odd is that you name supply capacity as the most important wvw mastery (beside movement based ones). two reasons for that: in a considerable amount of other places you offer a "depends on what you want" approach, and generally this is regarded as one of the least prioritized abilities due to the very low reward/investment ratio. popular examples include pretty much any mastery not specific to a given siege type, including even build/repair master because locking yourself in place for 10 seconds is rather risky and supply is useless if you cannot use it.
---
None of it is sexist. You are just too soft not to get triggert by every single criticism.
---
too bad its good for decreasing overpopulation
---
Adding onto this, the Tomb of the Primeval Kings in Desert Highlands has some chests you can open daily, about 5 not including the ones you can open with Desert keys
---
Your saying its off hand but what if that hand is Brahams main hand.
---
Maybe mobility pot? It adds 220ish concentration with 150AR.
---
Nooooo but it's Christmas 😢 How are people supposed to decorate the aerodome without banners?
---
Although you could play with any 2 classes and play end game content together, if you're looking for complimentary roles, guardian (firebrand) + revenant (renegade) is a very solid one in fractals and raids for the quickness and alacrity generation. The guardian can either bring dps alongside boons, or go full healer, and the renegade can be built to heal and buff, bring some modest dps with 10-man buffs, or solid dps.
---
I should mention though, that revenant is kind of a pain to level up, as a lot of skills and important traits take a long while to unlock.
---
Gotcha, what's the class that is usually use to tank in those raids? I guess I dont want to go like engenier with a vitality build to face tank mini bosses when let's say idk warrior or guardian are the most effective class in the game
---
Likewise, but I play a guardian the most. That could be because I mostly play with my wife and my daughter, though, and I'm always trying to keep them safe.
---
The usual tank in endgame is a mesmer with the chronomancer elite spec from HoT. Guardian with the PoF elite spec, firebrand, also works well but is less common in most groups.
---
Thing is, fractals encourages people segregating. If youre good enough, you go CMs, if youre not, you do T4 groups. I guess scourges can do T4 groups, but even then, itd really do wonders if you use a more carry class like healbrand (which is weaker than condi quickbrand in competent groups, but has great carry potential in weaker groups).
---
I would get killed and eaten by a mordrem within 5 minutes (and I'd only last that long by running and screaming)
---
Its not like devs are psychics or anything; They dont know what every little combination of action does and neither will they get magically informed if someone figures a thing like this out.
---
And even if they did know it for a year and had it on a low priority fix list somewhere, it becoming public knowledge and being used like this actively makes it more important cause people are overloading instances with objects now
---
I just blindly followed this guide 
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/brs41g/complete\_skyscale\_unlock\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/brs41g/complete_skyscale_unlock_guide/)
---
The elevation toggle only shows about half of the layers on DM.
---
Ooof, the anet shilling is real.
---
Both are good. Thief has this extremely OP trait Invigorating Precision that allows you to heal for 20% of your critical damage when you have Fury. On level 80, with proper gear, you would be critting most of the time and you can maintain Fury on yourself reliably. So you can just pew pew away with your P/P from range and resustain constantly or go ham in melee.
---
For Ranger it is also easy to run solo as your pet is there to get aggro and you have quite a lot of evades, blocks and invulnerabilities yourself. Your passive sustain will be bit weaker than Invigorating Precision Thief depending on your spec but it should still be enough.
---
can you do it on mounts?

Elementalist tend to be in zergs and if someone tries to fight you while you’re repairing with the rest of the Zerg, they’ll probably die for it!
---
This is the way.
---
while skill (executing a rotation while doing mechanics) in pve far exceeds on what you can do and how much damage you do, the build still needs to be good.  
---
and in general that means: you specialise in one thing and thats you build.  
---
you want to play a condition build? get that condition damage and duration. want to play a power build, get power, crit &amp; critchance.  
---
...and then have the right weapons for it. if you pick a power weapon and play a condition build, you will suck. if you use a condition weapon and play a power build, you will suck. if you use a poor weapon in general, you will suck (in pve for example: warrior with hammer or guardian with staff, simply useless weapons, not your fault).  
---
...and then you still need to pick right traits. power / condition builds without the right damage modifiers and you will simply suck.  
---
next step mechanics. have trouble with 5 veteran / elite enemys as soulbeast with a power build? why not get that smokescale in and let it set the blind field. merge -&gt; greatsword 2 (for damage, and buffing the next hit), worldly impact, weaponswap axe 4 + 5. boom elites dead. 
---
use skills which compliment your build and not: i am soulbeast, i only take soulbeast skills. thats not how gw2 is played.  
---
i mean you can play it like this, but thats exactly why you made this thread on reddit.

As someone who doesn't log in much anymore, what /exactly/ was happening with banners? I heard of instance crashes and that's it. What made it fun?
---
I don't hate creative people and art, the problem is not what the people created with that, the problem is that this art crashed instances and games and you can't tell me that everyone just wanted to draw pictures, most of the people who abused it just spammed a banner everywhere until there is nothing else.
---
oh, cmon, u can do all hp solo. its just hard, as it should be :p
---
Put it this way: you cannot mount in Spirit Vale. Mount counts as a skill. They can even disable certain things in specific areas such as you cannot use traps under water. So, I have no doubt that Arenanet can do such a thing, but I believe it would take way more effort to go disable/enable banners for each map/area/content rather than to fix the issue.

I played gw2 on macbook pro 13 inch for 3 years doing hardcore raiding. First, you need to use bootcamp to install windows and install gw2 in the bootcamp. Second search google for gw2 command line arguments you will need to set -forwardrenderer.

Lastly I have tried playing gw2 on mac os but it is not good you will lag way more than using bootcamp. About 15-20 fps difference.

Chronomancers can channel certain skills and very quickly use CS as it channels and the skill will be up again. Saves about half a second which really helps

Hi!  It's been some time since I played, started up again yesterday
---
About 30 minutes ago, killing just level 12 stuff, I had an orange recipe for a Sigil drop.  Now, to me, orange is a big deal (though the sigil seems kinda dud, I think it's something about lizard killing?), but I am jus wondering if I basically just had a rare drop?!  Or do sigil recipes drop frequently &amp; are naturally the higher qualities of things?!  
---
Either way, though I never managed to gel with the game in the past entirely, I am having a ton of fun now so I am not fussed, haha!
---
Imagine being this clueless while also being this entitled.
---
Focus
---
Mount action is not a player skill per se; it's transformation effect. It's closer to tonics than anything else. Underwater skills are entirely different than regular skills, and some underwater versions are just not implemented. There was no situation that any regular player skill or trait (and only that one and not all of them) was disabled in only one, particular instance.
---
The game is nearing maintenance mode as explained by Deroir on this [clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/WildSnappyGoblinSSSsss) so I wouldn't recommend picking it up now.
---
You obviously don't know where the word comes from or its actual meaning. Or you wouldn't be talking about grammar police. And thank you for your inconsiderate nature regarding ptsd sufferers everywhere.

---
Can’t find a solution for this...
---
So I'm currently about to start playing GW again. I've never made it super far into the game before. Like level 8. I think that's because I've always played alone and had nobody to talk to . Where's the best place for me to go to join a guild? or whatever they are called in this game.
---
You have a chance to get pieces from the pods that appear after completing events. I'd say do both at the same time since to buy the pieces you also need to do the meta event to farm it's currency.
---
the word "usually" doesn't sound very comforting to me lol. but anyway, are the events in Dragon Stand enough to eventually get me to the completed armor set?
---
shield phantasm is the worst one

Fully aware yes, merely using it as an example of how players dislike the Nevermore collection
---
In front of a teleport? What do you mean?
---
I constantly ask myself why ANET keeps focusing on story above all else in a game where the story not only lacks foundation (LS1, accessibility of LS2, poor quality of PS), but also where the story iis the weakest part of gameplay.

If a plane is bugged all those of same series do not take off till the problem is solved. Are you serious ?

Precursor collection yes, crafting is crafting. Nothing fun about crafting :P

I was thinking of going for Kudzu.

Thanks for the info ;)
---
The writers are just emulating typical guild drama of the top tier guilds in gw2 :^)
---
There are three lanes in the map so open the pods of the lane you are in as you go and after the final boss is killed go back and open pods in the other two lanes.
---
I agree. I generally do not like the people they make you work with in every mission of the game.
---
I personally use dolyak stance on my soulbeast in open world for the stability and break-stun. Someone knocked you on the ground? Dolyak! Wanna run through mobs that have tons of cc? Dolyak! I love it so much I used to bring it in t4 fractals without much dps loss. The best thing about this game is that you can change your build on the fly depending what you need at the moment. Spend a little time reading all the ranger skills and traits and you will never have any problem adapting your build to your preference c:

I've been kind of scared to get into the meta because it's new and still a bit too complex for me  but I guess it should be worth it and probably the exact same way as you're saying
---
You mean LACK of rewards.

Excellent, thanks! Almost done with World completion. Only Orr left. In the meantime, gonna read up a bit more on them legendaries :)
---
It depends. Focus is higher damage on its own, but the shield phantasm provides slow, which increases your crit chance/damage. If slow uptime on the target is very low I believe this makes the shield phantasm more DPS than focus.
---
Additionally, the shield phantasm provides protection in the area so it may be more valuable if protection uptime is low.
---
The achievement from killing the boss in under 20 minutes rewards the ley-energy matter converter, which is incredibly useful as well. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ley-Energy_Matter_Converter
---
No, they are not. That item has been available for many years now. If you use it, you can choose from 3 dances and you can also invite others to dance in sync with you.
---
They recently added those 3 dance animations as emotes if you bought that item, so you actually got more for your money.

It's not just team B, the LS has always been garbage. Since gw2 is more of a single player game than an mmo, there many more of the former with far better stories than gw2.
---
When everyone saw the cape ads
---
What weapon do I use most of the time?
---
This one looks cool and awesome, Craft it. Legendary tbh is either you are going for the skin or the convinience of the changeable stats.
---
It's almost like the characters have different facets to them like regular people unlike you Hard Man Who Makes The Hard Choices
---
It was in 2013, if memory serves, and one of the steps of the earlier personal story got stuck after they overhauled the method by which the game runs audio files in the overworld. It was a performance update, said the GM who replied to my "quest stuck" support ticket, but by some miracle adjusting the soundtracks had rendered several NPC scripts unusable. They just never spawned. They fixed it shortly afterwards.
---
I agree, we should nerf chronoscourge
---
Anet doesn't have the IQ points to think like that sadly. They see problem or something affecting gemstore sales, they shut down immediately like a caveman while they try to fix by getting their 1 person team to fix their sphagetti code. That's why I'm so irate over them doing this the day before raids. They think they can take their sweet time doing this and it won't affect anyone at all. It's quite the opposite.
---
Looks like its a black friday store entry
---
Well your statement about being a boon bot is completely wrong. Not to mention the guide is spotty and doesn’t seem like a lot of experience is put behind it.
---
Aegis
---
Yes
---
The GW2 NPC scripts are notoriously fragile so the new audio code probably slightly changed the timing which messed up the triggers. There are quite a few scripted events that break because somebody or something causes the NPC to temporarily stop. You can do it on some of them by talking to the NPC before it is ready because they pause to give the generic racial greeting response. A few of the legendary collection quests break because the NPC gets attacked by something during their walk &amp; talk phase.
---
I suggest you to just do the meta every once in a while and loot the pods around the posts after the meta is done (you'll need around 50 machetes per clear). It will give you currency and mats from all the hot maps, generic loot and crystalline ore. If you ever want to do a 2nd gen legendary weapon or any legendary armor, trinket or backpack, you will need a lot of those ores. Also, start the collection for your character's spec weapon and its respective machined counterpart: there's a piece that drops from the pods when the collection is active.
---
On a side note, repeating the story with other characters will also give you 1 bladed helmet, 1 auric weapon, 1 chak weapon and 1 lootbox key per character among other stuff. I actually went to do it with all my classes, because those weapons cost a lot of currency and it's faster to get most of them through the story. After getting the chak weapon, you can choose some efficient classes and keep going till the end of the story with them.
---
I think attention should be brought elsewhere. Just look how trash warrior is without banners...same with ranger tbh
---
And no one is surprised that sometimes these heroes just idolize you as a commander, and expect you to make decisions. And in the next Chapter they spit on your orders and do what they want? Now it's time to decide: either the commander is an authority for these characters, or he's trash.
---
I disliked all GW2 story characters from the beginning. The only story characters I liked (Caudecus, Balthazar) were turned into bad guys by ANet writers. GW2 has one of the worst stories I've ever seen in a game, and that includes those games with no stories because GW2 story is in the negative. I didn't even play Path of Fire storyline because Balthazar is a good guy and feminist ANet writer is a bad guy, as far as I'm concerned, and I reject her materialism. And don't even get me started on the whole race of Gremlins, that is, Asuras, who are literary demons of Hindu mythology and in the game have pretty much the same personality/design. Ugly and arrogant.
---
This was my 1st thought too
---
OP's on about speedclears: going for a record when your squad is down 4400 offensive stat points is a fool's game. Almost any other raid group is gonna pick up their clears same as ever, because you're right about banners almost never being *required* to meet DPS checks to get kills in this game.
---
As the others said, the game has already past its peak
---
BUT
---
There's a lot of content to be played, we're talking about several thousands of hours. While those who have already done most of it may express boredom, the content is there for anyone to enjoy it from the start. Maps are really interesting and detailed, combat is neat, classes are interesting, story is meh/linear (although above the MMO average), lore is ok, group pve content is fun (some of the raids are *awesome*, and even more if you find a nice team), small-scale pvp is actually not bad but it's in a rough spot support and balance-wise, and kinda the same goes for the big-scale pvp (it can get really fun as well).
---
Definitely worth trying and worth buying later on, back in the day I tried every single MMO I could get my hands on and I ended up here. It may be not as flashy as others, but as a game I've really enjoyed it during these years.
---
I'm European so I can't help you with the second part.
---
Don't use overpriced macs in general.
---
I'll take it
---
I've had ping spikes today too, not as bad as yours tho, only with gw too.
---
me!
---
i will send the key trough a PM :)
---
sorry to late mate :(
---
When my norn ranger wears her temple armour, her head floats a few centimetres above her neck.....they never fix armour issues.
---
Gold damnit.
---
yeah, no. the most important distinction is between what a company designs and releases as endgame *content* (wvw, pvp, raids, fractals), and what customers perceive and use as endgame activity.
---
the latter can be virtually anything from gvgs to speedclears and even endless gathering or crafting which by *design* are nothing but side activities.
---
endgame content consists of repeatable post-progression activities that keep players engaged long-term through occasional changes, events, or the ability for players to add their own spin to it.
---
this type of content sits at the center of virtually any multiplayer game, as it's a simple and proven tool to form a reliable core of ever returning veteran players that make the game look perpetually active and from which content creators will emerge. and *this* is why an mmo cannot survive with mostly non-repeatable slowly trickling story content alone.
---
these types of endgame content are generally created  to require minimal effort from the company to keep them running, which is why e.g. ATs are such an amazing feature. alas minimal effort does not mean virtually no effort. if a company is too neglectful with these types of content they will pay for it with their reputation and player goodwill, and it takes significant effort to build these modes back up to where they fulfill their purpose.
---
Pfft. Surely the current Living World Saga will last all of 2020. And what is beyond that is unknown. How do you define "nearing"?
---
Any location in Central or HoT to stat selectable Exotic weapons? I'm drawing a blank.
---
Is there any solution to this problem? I got the same issue and am totally unable to play
---
the game since this morning :( for all of my guildmates the game works without any problems
---
Mine says it ends dec 24th 01:00 so it should be local time.
---
Thanks everyone! Funny what taking a few years off does to you, I click on my main character and I don't understand half the new pop-ups describing new mechanics and stats. Excited about learning it all again, especially because I've never played this with a fps over 20 before!
---
While these suggestions are great, I’d also recommend you consider parking characters in Crystal Oasis.  There is a rich quartz crystal node there that will give you 10 quartz crystals per character per day for ~43 silver in value before taxes.
---
Contrasting with the flax farm that nets ~17s per character before taxes at current prices if you aren’t using Glyph of Bounty or Item Booster.
---
Oooohh.. Nice teeth~
---
I mean, I don't dislike them either, at all actually. But let's face it, OP is right about them being not much more than a comical / sometimes annoying B-cast while the Commander does all the real work.
---
You can check the wiki for the best sources (in game type /wiki leystone armor). But dragons stand does drop them during the meta and from the pods in the zone. I would say most of the time I get one from participating. 
---
I think you can buy leystone boxes from the vendor at the end too.
---
But I already have 96% Buff Duration..
---
I wanted to make a generator out of all the legendary, map completion and "now what" posts, but then I figured this sub might already be using one.
---
Yeah I looked up traceroute and ping and it looks like some AWS instance is routing me to a network that doesn’t exist.
---
It's mostly irrelevant and used only in end game, but most sigils are fairly cheap and easier to just buy than craft.
---
In your case that hour is 1h after midnight, correct?
---
You're asking for a pretty experienced SB/Weaver that knows their class pretty well if you're expecting DH dps.
---
You can basically count on any pug DH to keep up, stay alive, and do decent DPS/CC. You can't ask that of every SB or Weaver

It's a community built around shared interests and experiences. I don't know anyone IRL who plays GW2 so when someone posts relatable GW2 things like a legendary or fanart or a screenshot I appreciate that there is a place in the world I can go where there are people who like and relate to something I like and relate to.
---
Not everything needs to be a guide or a complaint thread. It's genuinely nice sharing an experience with people online and having them share theirs, even if it is repetitive.
---
It will be broken for a few days. You'll live.
---
Surprisingly enough, none of the exchange mods have been banned for having RMT gold passing through their accounts/guild banks. That suggests they have some kind of process in place to try and minimize the affected accounts.
---
Hell, Souls middlemanned for the chak transaction you mentioned and was not suspended despite the buyer/seller being banned.
---
Of course, Anet can't reveal what their actual process is as it would just empower RMTers.
---
He wanted us to know he's a bigot.
---
third to last option worries me
---
Heyya. So... as a player for more than 7 years, I can say: Yes this game is worth it.   
---
I know it's easy to say when you grew with the game but tbh, try it. The game has a f2p/try version what is basically the basic game for free with no trading post and some other stuff. but just try it. It shows you the story, the game and fight design and also the ingame community.   
---
About other Aussie players, I can assure you, that I have at least one in my guild :'D (EU servers)

 (I am not so sure how often I check reddit tho)
---
hello fellow gamers of the same exact game. I just did something you might consider cool. Oh you don't think its cool because you did the same thing months ago? Guess I'll quit.
---
Revenant: greatsword
---
Engineer: greatsword
---
Thief: greatsword
---
Elementalist: greatsword
---
Why? Cause greatsword is OP in fashionwars and the only way to balance it is by giving every profession a greatsword.
---
I'm just ~~half~~ kidding of course.
---
See? You don't need banners for speed clears ;)
---
Well done.
---
I loved doing that, but I believe it doesn't work anymore? I actually forgot, so maybe I need to give it another shot.
---
Sooo what you're saying is that I shouldn't make a post about how I got Warclaw after semi-AFKing WvW?
---
The direction of the dev team makes a lot more sense if you take a step back and think about GW2 as a free-to-play mobile game that happens to be on PC.
---
A bit of a late reply but some people simply enjoy the up front instant damage and the power fantasy of hitting your opponent *hard* with every hit you do as opposed to the DoT fantasy of whittling your opponent down with condi builds.
---
Not much else to it, really. It's just a particular preference.
---
Not if you want protection.
---
I don't think Lost Time does any damage anymore. Run Chronophantasma instead, or Seize the Moment if you need to create more quickness (when you need to take a different utility skill for instance). As others have said, the shield phantasm does the least damage - not less than auto attacking, but not really more either.
---
However, I can think of three instances that you might want to use the signet on your shield phantasm: to increase slow uptime (for lone power chronos or thieves and the like that profit from the number of conditions, in case you are the single support chrono or think the other support chrono and the druid are not capable enough), to ensure protection uptime in critical phases (in case boons get lost for some reason), and to get more blocks (can be very handy on Qadim in W6 when tanking, for instance). So in short, the shield phantasm is almost exclusively for utility.
---
Focus for Dps. Shield for protection/slow uptime/blocks.
---
I know right, characters have feelings and weak points, what a crime!
---
*shows gen1 legendary*
---
Regardless, depending on your timezone, you'll still be playing alone, even if you beg for help.
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that caused the completion of Light Puzzle achievements to reset daily.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_updates/2019-12-05
---
Aussie here. I definitely think it's worth picking up, lots of fun to be had and unlike most other MMOs the combat is more dynamic and active than traditional MMOs like Wow.
---
The OCE hours are decently populated for normal PvE (GW2 uses a megaserver system where every player on any of the NA servers will be placed in the same map as other players until it "fills" and spawns a new map) so doing open world group content shouldn't be a problem. Doing fractals (dungeons in GW2) isn't a problem either, but raids can be harder to find a group for (that's normal for every MMO).
---
The only thing server will matter for (aside from picking an NA or EU one - OCE people get better ping on NA) is WvW (large scale group PvP). The unofficial OCE server was Sea of Sorrows and it still has one of the stronger OCE populations in WvW but it's probably not very organised anymore (WvW is mostly very hit and miss in activity until the server update lands) otherwise maybe try Blackgate if you can get onto it (again, it only matter for WvW, all PvE and small scale PvP doesn't care about server).
---
There are a few OCE guilds that play every day and even recruit during open world events. Just by playing some of the group events in the Heart of Thorns maps during OCE hours you will find other Australians to join and play with. Otherwise there is a specific subreddit for GW2 guild recruitment, I can't remember the name.
---
I should mention too that for main hand axe it's best to stick to auto-attacks and the 3 skill. The 2 skill is really weak. Even if all 5 axes hit it does less damage than the auto-attack. Axe off-hand skills are both super high damage, so use both of those plenty.
---
Greatsword 2 will buff your pets next attack in addition to being your highest damage skill on the kit, so try to use it right before using your pet skill for even bigger damage.
---
You need **both** the Righteous Rebel trait and a very high boon duration for this build to work (maintain 100% alacrity on its own). The figure I gave is the lowest boon duration % you go down to and still maintain Alacrity on your own assuming you hit F4 as soon as it is available every time.
---
I'll do some very quick maths assuming you have 100% boon duration to make it simpler.
---
An Alacrity stack from Order from above will last 3 second at 100% BD and *assuming* 100% Alacrity uptime the 20 sec cooldown will become 16 sec. So we need to produce at least 16 sec of Alacrity every 16 seconds to maintain it perfectly.
---
Those pieces of informations remain true whatever the scenario.
---
**Without the Righteous Rebel trait**
---
You get 4 stacks of 3 sec so 12 sec in total, therefore you cannot maintain permanent Alacrity in this situation with Orders From Above alone (could work with Ventari Legend and Salvation or some random other boon extension like a Signet of Inspiration or Sand Squal).
---
**With the Righteous Rebel trait**
---
You get 6 stacks of 3 sec so 18 sec in total so you can maintain permanent Alacrity in this situation with Orders From Above alone. Given that the stacks are rather short when the 6th stack will want to enter the queue the very 1st stack would have already been completely consumed so no risk of it being wasted in general.
---
Additionally for Raids you now also hit 10 targets instead of just 5, which is what you usually want to achieve (and it also makes it easier to affect everyone).
---
If you have some boon extension in the raid group (not really frequent in fractals imo) you can greed a bit the boon duration as you will get at least 3 extra seconds every 16 sec and the fact that some fights may have some phases where maintaining Alacrity is not really useful/necessary.
---
Without external boon extension the lowest you can go down to and still theoretically maintain 100% Alacrity is 78% boon duration (16 sec cd / 6 stacks / 1.5 sec for base stack) but you still need Righteous Rebel for that. Without it you would need 167% boon duration and that's not a figure anyone can reach (max would be 120% I guess with [Facet of Nature Dragon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Facet_of_Nature%E2%80%94Dragon) and a source at 100% boon duration).
---
Nah, you can do it, you'll just be judged to be a noob, scrub, and generally stupid player.
---
_shows legendary spike_
---
Is that really true though? While yes, mechanically they don't do much, Taimi and Gorrik do crucial research and come up with many of the solutions to our problems; Rytlock had his solo mists adventure which kicked off an entire expansion; Marjory's shadowing of "Lazarus" kept us on his trail when he disappeared; and we seem to be dealing with the aftermath of Braham's solo shiverpeaks adventure right now.
---
I was under the impression that OP's issue was that the B-cast have their own stuff that they care about rather than shutting up and only doing things that help the commander directly.
---
The whole point of 4xDHs is that you don't need an extra slot for quickness by simply taking "Feel My Wrath" 4 times. Add "Bane Signet" + "Perfect Inscriptions" and you got incredible burst dps.
---
Not to mention all the blocks, utility and pulls DHs have anyway. And DHs are easy to play which is pretty important for pugs.
---
No evidence, just my guess. But since the raiding community is really small I'd say that creating new raid wings every 3 months wouldn't bring too much profit.
---
I'm going to agree (based on assumption) that raids are not the largest playstyle. Particularly since they are capped once a week, and people who are serious raiders can get their favorite wings done within an hour or two comfortably, and then be left with little to do the rest of the week.
---
There is also the fact that it is very difficult to learn raids and to practice mechanics without a dedicated practice group. So I can't comfortably do Wing 7 even though I'm a competent raider with all 3 sets of legendary armor.
---
However, I don't think it's a problem of encounter difficulty but of learning curve. And precisely because the problem is learning curve, the community cannot grow.
---
Fractals do not have the learning issues raids have because they allowed one to easily learn mechanics with its leveling system. In fact, Fractals were a tremendous success during the first few years of the game. Their downfall was more because ANET abandoned the mode, introduced instabilities which are annoying, and altered rewards in a way that feels incredibly regimented. (My own personal bias suggests the 3-Fractal system is vastly superior over the Level Select we have today.)
---
Strike Missions *could* be the successor to both raids and fractals, bringing the fun of raids, but having the learning curve of fractals.
---
Hopefully ANET can perfect the system this time and grow the system.
---
It is my assumption the large majority of the playerbase play Fractals, Strike Missions, and Open World. I think ArenaNet should be concentrating heavily on those game modes over the story instances.
---
Lul
---
No, actually that the first time anyone has ever called me a snowflake. I shall wear it as a badge of honor.
---
Correct. In addition to the set amount of random projectiles, he also spawns additional ones targeted directly at each nearby player/summon
---
That was back in the good days of WoW. And when life was simpler.
---
Oki, there we got the answer
---
Okay, okay. But what about that world completion after 7 years? Ehh?
---
Scale armor isn't appropriate for an elementalist, but the notion is correct - just go for the light armor equivalent.
---
I camp my alts @ the elder wood farm near Pagga’s. It’s not the highest profit but you can log back in after a couple hours and chop more wood. 
---
It’s handy if you plan on making/farming out wood for a gen 2 legendary.
---
I don't think spirit weapons count anymore? I don't play guard anymore but I don't think they take damage
---
But that item is still available in the gemstore and non-obtainable in game? Or have they removed it?
---
You should only ever craft gen1 precursors if the journey also gives you an extra item like Kudzu, Juggernaut, and predator I’m sure there are others but I can’t think of them off the top of my head
---
The rest are just a waste of time and materials where  the only  benefit is the AP
---
Thanks for the input and reply, appreciated :)
---
Cool beans, thanks ;)
---
26:30 on the eleventeenth
---
In this case it's about the goal not the journey, because journey sucks.
---
Put that boxed copy back, right now! Wash your hands thoroughly, flush out your eyes, and head to your local hospital immediately. Contact with this game has been associated with severe addiction and, in isolated instances, rabies.
---
&gt;All instanced PvE content runs Banners, Dungeons, Raids, and Fractals for 7 years straight.
---
How do you guys not see this as the real problem here?
---
There's still new players joining the game and should be plenty of people around to do things with, even in low and mid level zones.
---
current days considering the image looks to be from /r/classicwow
---
Sorry bud, this isn't the game for you. Tea?
---
Frost Atronach from the real Elder Scrolls games looked better.
---
It doesn't. It tells you how much you have, but doesn't mention the existence of caps anywhere. You'd need to look for that info outside of the game.
---
A fantasy and preference can come out of anything tbh. Some people enjoy the fantasy of being a tiny asura wielding a giant greatsword to smack people's skulls in. Others simply enjoy the fantasy of doing upfront instant damage opposed to over time. Both of these are ultimately superficial during combat but it's really just the *idea* that people like. 
---
Also some people probably also attribute particular archetypes to damage types and vice versa which might color their preferences as well. Personally when I think of DoT damage I think of necromancers who utilize death magic or rogues who poison and bleed their enemies. When I think of warrior though I think of a brutish person with a lot of strength who does a lot of upfront damage with slow hard hitting weapons, or goes berserk with dual weapons (also a sword and board user). If OP is the same and if OP plays warrior primarily for this reason then I can see how this fantasy might clash with the fantasy of playing a warrior with a longbow (which also has the archetype of being a high-impact weapon) who does damage over time damage opposed to instantly.
---
But yeah basically people can find a preference in anything.
---
If you want profit and Volatile Magic, just go to Dragonfall.  Check LFG there if your map seems kind of quiet, otherwise just play.  Profit, Volatile Magic and even Karma if you buy the Karma drops will follow.
---
Post-reset there's usually a meta train or two that will run through a variety of Season Four maps, so you can look for that as well, but Dragonfall at any time should be good.
---
When crafting, you have a chance of getting a 'critical' craft, which adds 50% crafting XP gained.  The resulting item you make is no different, it just boosts the speed at which you level your crafting skill.
---
If you can make it to Blackgate, House of Bookah is OCX/SEA.
---
Else just head to Sea of Sorrows, The Royal Rose / Mists of Valhalla are OCX guilds.
---
Protection is always low uptime in pretty much any group. If you have nobody covering it, it's your job has chrono support. So bring those phatasm shield up for more Protection uptime. Overall it will help more the group than the couple 100 dps that focus 5 bring.
---
They mean it's cheaper to just buy the precursor.
---
I second this. Can Jormag just corrupt them, so I can get a new team? And Taimi, for the last time: "No! You're too young, too cute, and too precocious for my liking!"
---
&gt;So far they don't even have anything GW2 in the selection.
---
That I a not familiar with!  Try running a -repair on the GW2 exe file?
---
That sylvari makes me happy.
---
How
---
No, I meant in the context of fractals or other group content like that.
---
In open world I don't really care lol, sorry if it was unclear that I meant fractals.
---
Idk why I never thought of that.
---
 Thanks for the tip!
---
All I'll say is my static specifies melee only dps for that specific reason. Getting a ranger maining longbow in T4s that doesn't understand why it's a problem is far more common than one that does. It would be preferrable if you either never used longbow, or knew why it's a problem, and understood how to use it in a way that it isn't a problem for everybody else. Even then, I feel, if you're dpsing, there's far better options, like dagger, or sword, or greatsword.
---
As long as you do anything productive whatsoever youre welcome in wvw. Your server probably wont hit the population cap anyways, so just take camps and kill guards, stick with a tag and zerg, etc. Just do something to help your server and everyone will be cool with it
---
This lack of thinking is astonishing. Should they just let a game breaking bug stay in the game because a class needs the thing to work without the bug? What?
---
Druid uses full harrier because of the boon output. https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/druid/heal/
---
already did and tried the clean boot also deleted the appdata folder still not working.
---
I see people are downvoting me... I didn’t mean that image specifically, but the excitement of dinging 60 and getting your first epic mount. Those were such big milestones.
---
This is me!! This exact thing!! for at least 3 days now. I don't know enough to do the ping thing, but everything you describe is happening to me. Makes the game unplayable and it's so annoying and disappointing.
---
Is there any way to see if ANet is aware of the issue?
---
what do you bind on f123?
---
Technically, Sohothin is a one-and-a-half sword, lorewise, which means it can be used one-handed or two-handed.
---
Quite a few skins should be available as both sword and greatsword, like [Scion's Claw](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scion%27s_Claw), who's long handle showcases it is meant to be also used as a two-handed sword. And other "shortsword" skins should be available as both dagger and sword.
---
I wouldn't take the artistic liberties of a cinematic and compare them to the hardcoded limitations of game engine.
---
I even wrote that in the title
---
Full harrier for boon uptime, you want to be putting max stacks of might + fury on the party for as long as you can  and you can already overheal tremendously with harriers as long as people aren't face tanking mechanics, plus you can deal another 2-2.5k dps which can make or break a kill.
---
That's not really possible, because you're forgetting that this game has multiple localizations. Voice files in each localization would have different duration, so devs would need just pick one version (english) and hardcode the durations into the script (having the server load sound files - or worse: simulate sound playback - is incredibly pointless and wasteful).
---
This is why recently GW2 has been moving into the direction of clientside "conversations". That is, the client has the entire "script" of a conversation (which NPC says which line at which time), and the server just orders the client to start playing it. That way they can have conversation playing out in proper order and timings regardless of localization, as it's not the client's responsibility to wait for sounds to end. The side effect of this is that if you haven't been around when the order was broadcasted - you will miss the entire conversation (see Glenna conversations in W7, if you miss the start of it - you'll only see NPCs standing in place doing absolutely nothing for a long time). They could make it that the client would have to report back to server when the conversation is over, but if we're talking about any public or instanced events - it's a disaster waiting to happen: player disconnecting, or lagging out, or leaving the instance, or simply walking away can brick the entire script. Also if players are on different client localizations, it would get very awkward.

&gt;Engineer: Staff. Caster staff  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Warrior: Scepter. Caster, not clubbing things with it.
---
One of the main themes behind engineer and, slightly less so, warriors is that they don't use magic directly. They're the "non-magical classes". With Warriors it's left to interpretation (harder with Spellbreaker mind you) where it could be either "body enhancing magic" or "mundane physical training and morale boosting".
---
But with engineers, their profession is designed around being the "not magical class" where anything magic comes from tools and artifacts that harness magic, and not the engineer being spellcasters.
---
So staves and scepters as caster stuff would be a bit thematical breaking.
---
Don't remind me pls, you're making me sad that they nerfed it so much. To be fair, multi looting with different chars was absurd but after that they went overboard.
---
My forgotten druid (haven't played it for over an year) uses similar harrier/magi mix (harrier armor/weapons + magi trinkets) and I can confirm it is enough to maintain enough boons and heal in raids, unless something has drastically changed in year.
---
Thiefs got a one-way "mesmer" portal !
---
Time for you to be stars at the daily JPs !
---
I am Australian, have been playing for about 6 months. Game is fantastic. Well worth you downloading. Core Tyria (dowloaded games) is free. If you like it and want to continue, then there are 2 expansions packed with content including mounts.
---
show me an example of him using an off hand mace outside of this promo than.
---
\&gt;I'm main ranger  
---
\&gt;I don't know enough about my class to know why I can't go full magi instead of full harrier  
---
Pick one
---
Thanks for explaining. This whole thing is so sad and so frustrating. I wish it was over. I am in Australia not Europe btw. Who knows where they route us through?
---
Sometimes the answers don't stick/count, though. It only happened to me once, but I had to run back through and answer them all again
---
I mean how are mains ever gonna learn if they don't ask questions?

You guys are NA or Eu ? In any case u r awesome !
---
When does the Dragon’s Stand meta get run normally in NA? I feel like it never gets run.
---
Some of them are just impossible/crazily hard for some classes, ex: the lifestealing one that needs some crazy breakbar to stop its heal, or the freaking frogs when you don't have stealth detection yet. 
---
But eh, I could be wrong. With some optimal gear for core build, maybe it's possible.
---
He doesn't. That's kind of the point. The promo is just an artistic liberty, and not a representation of game mechanics.
---
Like how [this loading screen](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Into_the_Labyrinth_loading_screen.jpg) has him with his mace in two hands. Does it mean he ever uses a hammer? Nope.
---
I am about to start grinding so that i can start making my dusk. But i am unsure what to sell from said grind. Is it recommended to sell EVERYTHING i loot and salvage any greens/blues?
---
Guild banners are extremely buggy, some disappear when you change maps, some just stay until reset. But other than a bit of a mess nobody minds coz they'r useful sometimes.
---
He a Guardian. Guardians use Hammers,,,, Guardians **dont** use **off hand mace**         
---
Edit: **"Yet"**
---
but what have you bound on keys f1 f2 f3
---
Can't they just force the servers to reset? If they can I'd think this is would be a good reason since it's impacting the games performance for some players.
---
Oh but when I make a "low effort" meme I get down voted to the mists. 
---
Oh well. I up vote anyway.
---
You're missing the point.
---
Braham doesn't use hammers. Or two-hand his mace. It's artistic liberty. Like all the spears in the dozens to hundreds of concept art we've gotten over time.
---
So that promotional piece is not indicative of anything, as it can very, **very** easily be just artistic liscensing. Especially with Braham, who is well known for using a mace.
---
If Braham was carrying a pistol in that shot, that'd be far more telling given the fact that neither guardians nor braham ever wield a pistol. But a mace - **his** mace since 2013 - is not telling anything. Nor is a new character with non-standard weapons.
---
NPCs using non-standard weapons is old. As old as the base game, where Rytlock used a pistol off-hand (no, not the charr racial skill), and there's a mesmer wielding a shield in Orr. These weren't hints to any elite specializations since such a concept never existed at the time. They're just ArenaNet applying artistic liberties to things allowed in mechanics.
---
Are you EU? I'd be happy to jump on discord or something with you and try to bring you up to speed. I can talk and you can type if you are not comfortable with talking. We can do a lap around VB and stuff, let me know if you are interested, but I think people's replies here should be sufficient as well
---
I came back after being gone a year. Logged in and immediately had someone start insulting me in *unranked* pvp. Left my guild, deleted the discord and now just here telling people that returning to gw2 isn't going to last long.
---
Even better tracert guildwars2.com. For me it turned out to be problems between my ISP and the AWS server that the games run on and using a VPN fixed it.
---
Try using a VPN.
---
yea in fractals longbow is meta at every cm boss except skorvald so what's your point again?
---
i see you went for power damage, even tough you could get higher power stats easily and higher is better, i think 2000 power is enough to beat 5 enemies with basic greatsword. just get a hold of evade and gs 4 skill block for tanking and gs 2 5 2 combo. my advised specs for power are beastmastery skirmish soulbeast, advised power pet gazelle good with merged and unmerged. elite skill should be stance one.
---
I, myself went for condi soulbeast. weapons are shortbow+dagger,dagger; specs are skirmish wilderness soulbeast. utility skills are based on traps and survivals. 
---
with enough stats and good evade/block timing (3000 power or 2000 condi or full viper stats) it is a piece of cake to kill 10 or 20 enemies.
---
No, story rewards are once per character. And achievement rewards are once per account.
---
1. do the story
---
2. explore the maps
---
3. find a wvw guild to play with (most important){
---
4. find a pve guild for pve
---
5. dont let ppls opinion cloud ur fun
---
Its novelty as endgame is being affected by the emphasis on gem store/ black lion chest cosmetics including outfits. Many people these days plop on a shiny new outfit and mount skin. Sure they look really nice, better than most in game sets, but it loses the appeal of collecting and crafting one's own look.
---
Yea, I think I misunderstood to think he meant warrior was only useful as a bs. If that's the case then my bad haha
---
I got 3 hours out of the story, playing normally and doing 1 meta event that just happened to be on. Wouldn't say it was the shortest ep ever, especially since we know ep 2 might just be around the corner too.
---
How about they simply prioritise fixing the bug as urgent and actually fix it. If it was the gem store it would be fixed without even needing to be disabled.
---
I desperately hope so
---
Greeks arent nordic
---
Nah he just means you can't play the class because either you brought banners (and relied on them for dps) or didn't bring banners (and still relied on having them for dps). Either way the class is pretty much unplayable until this is fixed
---
Serious question. Why do people want housing in this game? Whats the benefit? What does it offer in terms of gameplay? We already have 2 abandoned systems (home instance and guild halls), 3 if you count sunspear refuge but oh well thats tied to living world so i can get behind the abandoning. No need for another instanced system that nobody uses because Anet wouldn't dare to make them actually useful as long as it's not locked behind the gemstore.... which it probably would be.
---
All I want for my house is Warrior Banners.
---
Hopefully they will put housing system in...
---
And if they don't want to make some sort of new instance , they could do it the old "home instance" , but we chose and decorate the house we want!!!
---
Can we see more lupi runs without reflect?
---
It gives people something to do outside of a daily chest list.  It can rebalance the value of useless materials, refocus Scribing, give hoarders/collectors something to work on, open up achievements all throughout the game for special decorations, and give them the ability to sell stuff on the gem store.
---
God  I miss my 4 story bar and pool......such an amazing system
---
I would just try out a VPN they often route you diffrently then your ISP to anets servers and could avoid a bad gateway.
---
Banners are ran but aren't required lol. They're just for optimal comps. Having alacrity and quickness is good enough to get through 90% of the content without needing banner.
---
That's the thing it doesn't it's set up like this
---
0%   DOWNLOADING:159   1MB/SEC                       FILES REMAINING: 406,105

Permanently no change except on downloading and the speed
---
Go to gw2 folder. Delete everything but data and launcher files. Restart launcher.
---
If that doesn't work, try [repair](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/201863008-Repairing-the-Game-Client).
---
I suggest you use a program called [gw2launchbuddy](https://github.com/TheCheatsrichter/Gw2_Launchbuddy/releases) to change the server where you download game assets from. It shows the ping to each one of the servers and you're free to swap to different ones that may have a better connection.
---
Oh, we read the post. We don't see a problem. You don't need a main. Pick a weapon you prefer the most across the classes you like to play and make that legendary.
---
DM me your questions and we can go from there. won't be able to help you with chrono but i'm quite decent with DH.
---
I tried doing dagger mainhand before and I kind of ran into the same issue. The range is short and anything more than 2+ mobs gets dicey because it struggles to hit more than 2 mobs at a decent range.
---
Instead of dagger/dagger, try sword mainhand/axe offhand. The sword allows you to hit more than one enemy with a wider range and axe #5 *melts* mobs.
---
I don't know how to use it
---
just do dailies. they're fast. master of monuments, guard killer, camp capturer, veteran creature slayer.
---
Also a PSA to piggyback: the Norn Chests (the small ones, not the glowing ones locked behind masteries) seem to not be capped across characters. I.e. take a different character through the map and your eternal ice nodes and mastery chests are already popped, but the Norn Chests have refreshed. So if you see yourself needing just a few more eternal ices and don't want to wait for reset, take a different toon through.
---
Everything you pointed out could be applied to guild halls, couldn't it? Why develope another system for that?
---
Download the program, run the exe, go to network settings and change the asset server.
---
Art is often fairly original though, where as these posts rarely are. You can hardly even compare the two.
---
Understood. Thank you for your response.
---
Thanks for the information ^_^
---
Thanks for your response. Its gonna make it easier for me to complete my skyscale collection
---
Usually the one before reset, the one after reset, and the one after that. On weekends it can pop up a little more frquently but it's hit and miss.
