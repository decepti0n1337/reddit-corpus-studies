The catch is that these builds become less stronger the more poeple are involved in the fight, thats the tradeoff.
---
---
---
Honestly looks like one zero is extra.
---
Yeah, happened to me, too. Group barely made it to one heart phase in the full 10 minutes (and that phase was over almost immediately because 4 or 5 people were afk autoattacking the invulnerable body). Then someone tried to solo the entire encounter... when we FINALLY respawned I tried to make it to the entrance and it threw me back in the fight. I /gg'd and just logged for an hour until it dumped me in a new instance where a kind soul rez'd me and I bolted for the door.
---
Fractals were supposed to be on a cadence of one every 6 months (and met that goal for a bit). Now no discussion about them and its been an entire year
---
We getting Warclae nerfs, all i want really so im golden.
---
Which, tbh, cannot be called a teaser like u/KamoteQ21 seems to be saying. We knew back from the PAX stream that Drakkar would play a role in Episode 2. That\_shaman just provided non-GW1 players with a non-obscured look at Drakkar's frozen GW1 model.
---

---
That\_shaman does occasionally tease stuff, but it's super obscure. Like when he took a picture of his character at Drakkar Spurs just before the Bitterfrost Frontier release, commenting on something completely unrelated to the location. So I would definitely disagree that "that\_shaman teases more than this".
---
Thanks for the data as always.
---
Thanks for the hard work you put into your guides!
---
The map was fun, even if it was short, the story was miles ahead of what we had before, and the strike missions were genuinely good. So yeah I'm looking forward to the next ep. Just because we ain't getting raids/fractals doesn't mean everything else they put out is trash.
---
 Hi looking, I'm Dad!
---
Hard Mode Strikes are not happening because they will “split the playerbase.” There’s a reason why they didn’t want repeatable raid cms, and probably aren’t developing any more raids at all. They also clearly view Fractal CMs as a mistake because the last one of those was over two and a half years ago. Hell, just having Fractals at all splits the playerbase into “open world players” and “instanced endgame players,” so they might also want to quietly let that die too (like they did with dungeons).
---
This is a glorified open-world solo exploration interactive movie where you only have to spam press F and 1 with optional social interactions that are very minimally rewarding. It’s time to get used to that.
---
Made it up.
---
Or an Icebrood Shark. If you play it slowly enough, you can see it has Drakkar's basic sihlouette - four fins, a long tail, and a hammerhead-like shaped head. But the fins are too short to be similar to his GW1 model, and it could just be an Icebrood (Hammerhead) Shark.
---
Chances are they are teasing Drakkar's model, though.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Here's what's interesting about the tease though: They're showing something swimming *above open water*. If this is the open world map - which Drakkar is confirmed a part of as a meta boss - then they just created new water tech for GW2, as before the water level was always at the Z-Axis, any water above was "fake water" and wouldn't enable underwater skills.
---
Would make sense, given it features the northern end of the new and expanded Drakkar Lake.
---
It seems to me we'll have more of Raven's norn flashbacks about what happened before we got to the Far Shiverpeaks.
---
Boy it took them this long to figure out?! Eureka!! People had been pointing this out since it was released among other issues. They never fail to surprise...
---
It depends on the map ip. 
---
some are bugged.
---
Ah true. For some reason I thought Deepstone was the last one. Reworks aren't generally viable for "New content"
---
I play daily but between an hour and 90 minutes. Weekends are about twice that, but only when it's too outside to go outside.
---
Yay! Signed up, as in all years! :D
---
See, you're just spouting non-sense at this point. Not even sure if you played the story or payed minimal attention while playing it. Can you give any concrete reason as to why the story is shit and "fanfic-level writing" so far in the prologue + episode 1?
---
from that interview, they did when they launched episode 1
---
If you got a Svanir
---
Yo, I'll solve it
---
Check out the hook
---
While Taimi revolves it
---
Easier=You can smash 1 and it'll be done in five minutes
---
Just because you don't touch pvp or and other modes doesn't mean there is other players who are invested to it.
---
What sells in GW2 is fluffy fashion bullshit. No one gives a flying fuck about the superficial one-dimensional story or the game play. The content (who’s mostly catered to the target demographic of casual role-players) so far has been 85% gemstore microtransactions, 10% story, and 5% laughably easy repeatable instanced endgame for YEARS now.
---
Ah, so you are the one that buys all those gifts that I refuse to open.
---
But seriously, this game's rare drops don't feel good to chase after, at all.
---
Wait for the Desert Highlands Bounty Hunter Daily. The influx of people will give a higher chance to get an unbugged map instance
---
I can't even download the game =/
---
Compared to most MMOs, I'd say content releases every 1-2 months with gemstore updates every 2 weeks is more than drip feed.
---
Even between S4 and S5, we had constant stuff going on. Community events, festivals, or bi-monthly Season 5 releases.
---
*Real drip feed style releases there*.
---
You're just bitching just to bitch.
---
I finished Vision by selling gifts I farmed from the JP and bells. Last year I funded winters presence the same way. 
---
Thank you for a second year of shines!
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Snow_Diamond Mostly minis and tonics with some other cosmetics and recipes.
---
I get what you’re saying. The same trade off happens with a zerg build in small havoc group or roaming solo, but those are two completely different ways to play wvw. If they only balance overturned builds for zergs, which do not do well in a small group or solo then they are missing balance on the other side of what happens in wvw.
---
It really has more to do with the fact that there's really just not anything worthwhile to buy with gold anymore  
---
Everything they release in game is either reasonably easy to earn via direct methods or casual farming or is cosmicly expensive like auras  
---
There's not a whole lot of 300+ gold items anymore. Even BLC weapons will often not be more than 50g a pop when they're released and the chest ones often go for less than 20g each  
---
This all means that people just stop buying gems to convert to gold and thus aren't stacking more weight on the other scale to keep things from slowly creeping upward over time  
---
This is all assuming Anet isn't just directly influencing the conversion ratios to make buying store gear with a CC more enticing.
---
I kind of hated those, though.
---
The missions themselves were fun, but not being able to control my build was meh at best.
---
I know right?
---
As soon as I saw this, I thought, *"The same people that bitch about no telling us whats happening, will be the first to complain."*
---
I’m not saying Anet did it for swiftness.  I’m saying that’s all we need it for.  Even then, it’s not what anyone was asking for.  I still don’t like the mount and probably won’t after they try and balance it.
---
They really should have just given everyone an ability that gives like a minute of swiftness after using a waypoint.  It’s not like we already had that system in place or anything!  Would have saved them time and money to develop things we’ve actually asked for.
---
Anet once again meeting the expectations......i mean i didn't expect anything so im content.
---
Heal Firebrand can tank effectively as a pure healer (you still provide boons including quickness and don't waste a slot) and if you really wanted to "face-tank" running minstrels gear on them makes it kind of a joke to tank many bosses. Only some that want dual tanks or have rapid multi-hits (peerless) would be bad. Also the meta tanks on a couple fights are druid or DPS (Dhuum) in better groups.
---
It's some kind of de-sync, that player is not there anymore, even tho you can see him mounted, immobile. Happens quite often.
---
PBM Holo.

Head cannon =/= head canon

Awesome goalpost moving.

THEY DON'T TELL US ANYTHING.
---
*anet puts out roadmap*
---
THEY DON'T TELL US ANYTHING. BIG IS COMING!@!#@#$@#!$@#$
---
*rolls eyes*
---
Yet you only cite those builds as problems though, and not those zerg ones, why are the complaints always aimed at these builds yet roamers never complain about OP cleanse and heal and corrupt aoe spam builds and just log another build for other purposes? I like different flavours of playstyles and homogenizing them doesn't sound like much fun.
---
I mostly felt bad for necros.  The change to symbol of swiftness for guardian staff 3 though made it really easy to stack it up though.  You could easily max out the time before you even got to a fight.
---
theres only one thing wvw, spvp, hard pve and soft pve players agree, we all want new specs...
---
It could also juat be a poor choice of perspective. Remember drakkar is *fucking enormous*
---
Where are the damn raids and fractals what the fuck. Why do we get time limited festival nonsense and single player story.
---
Can I ask why? I see a lot of people are reacting really negatively toward it, but here I was thinking it could be interesting since it sounds like they're going to try something new, and we don't yet know what it entails. What about it do you think will be bad?
---
The living story is not like it was in season 1, you're not going to miss anything by doing the story in order or later. The maps are going to be a little less populated but with mega servers it shouldn't be that much of an issue. Playing through the story is all in instanced content from season 2 onward so no more map changes (besides some current events added in).
---
Oh I don’t disagree. Zerg builds need balanced for sure.  I play in both zergs and havoc so don’t mean to single only one area out.
---
No.  I can confirm they said new raids and fractals are months away.  It was a German article. It isn't made up. A quick Google confirmed it.
---
&gt; but he'd probably understand why I've never, ever told anyone about being queer in real life, and will never act on it or say a word about it to my family while they're alive.
---
Lets go with your very example that you gave a comment above.
---
&gt; than with a born-and-bred American from the Bible belt in the same wealth class as me
---
Would not a gay american from a poor working class bible belt family also never act on it or say a word about being gay to his family? It once again, seems to be an issue of class. Not identity.
---
&gt;When I talked about struggles earlier in my posts, I meant social or emotional ones. Things like, relationships to parents. Some people grew up loved and cared for, some people got told life would be better if they didn't exist. In my case, I grew up understanding that my parents gave me life and provided for me, and in exchange, it's my duty to show my appreciation by studying well and getting a good job. That way, I can fulfill my obligation of providing for my parents when they're old.
---
But that's another thing that the asian billionare will never be able to care or relate about. He doesn't have to ever worry about providing for his parents, nor is he going to have to worry about life being better if he didn't exist. 
---
Both of these are problems of class and poverty. Not race.
---
&gt;What makes life difficult is physical needs like not knowing if you'll have enough money for food next week, but also emotional ones like wondering if it even matters to the world whether you're around or not, or questioning if you have any meaningful connection to anyone. I think that everyone struggles with those questions, and the way people try to answer them drives how they live.
---
But those aren't issues of race or identity either. Relationship to your parents and emotional issues about being worth it to the world are thigns that exist in all humans, and those who most often suffer crises from it are those on the lower classes because they are under far more material pressure which puts emotional strain on them.
---
All the problems you're presenting here seem to be directly correlating to poverty and the working class instead of culture or race.
---
And so far, that has more to do with the holidays than anything else. We'll have to see the pace between 2-3 and 3-4 to get a really accurate judge of the pacing.
---
Because they don’t want to make short fractals that people can farm for easy money (by selling encryptions on the TP). There’s a reason the new fractals have been longer and they’ve deliberately lengthened the shorter ones that people used to farm.
---
The next fractal they’ll add length to will be Mai Trin, followed by Solid Ocean, I think. For Mai, what they could end up doing is starting in the room directly after you finish Aetherblade Retreat and make you fight extra mobs to progress before you get to where we currently start the fractal from.
---
Grothmar came out two months before the last living world update, and this one is coming out 2 months after the current one.
---
So, no, it really doesn't have to deal with the holidays
---
Well, there is reason to believe it.
---
1. We know the map will go towards the inland sea that Jormag created in the Shiverpeaks, and cover the northernmost portion it, based on map-breaking.
---
2. And since we know that Drakkar is a world boss.
---
From this we can deduce a high chance that:
---
1. There will be underwater content in the new map, and
---
2. If this is Drakkar, it will likely be an underwater world boss.
---
But going off of #1 here, this means there must be a water level, and access to the sea. Unless this shot is of a "technically above water but altered to make it seem like it's below water", it would place this tunnel underwater on a mechanical level.
---
That all said, just because there's reason to believe such is possible, doesn't make it so. They could easily do as you said - it wouldn't be the first time they had "faux underwater tunnels" (we see them do such in CoE; even Rata Sum has an aquarium that is mechanically waterless and has "flying" fish in it).
---
My point is the *possibility* that this is so.
---
There should be hot pot.
---
And all of that is more than the pittance we’ve gotten in 2019.
---
Wow, that's so impressive. Literally nobody else does that. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
And unlike with Hallowe'en, it's not even worth opening 1,000 gifts on alts for the Rimed Verdant Wintersday Gift because you lose nearly 50g doing so
---
They will bring LW1 in Gw3, mark my words xD
---
Nah, roaming solo and small havoc is more fun than following a zerg. Just feel both areas could be adjusted some.
---
For the love of God give us something to do
---
This is ridiculous. Throughout all of fiction, it is very common to put in intentionally unresolved storylines. It's a legitimate literary tool that writers use to enhance stories. Sometimes you're never supposed to find out what happens to X, or what becomes of Y, and that mystery makes the stories have more depth than if they were to tell you what happened.
---
This is so dumb. And that's why it's dumb.
---
Careful, according to everyone on reddit ff14 is perfect in every way. I say they're fucking delusional train hoppers who obviously Haven t actually played that shit game
---
Not really. Balance is actually in a pretty good spot, but it's just the lack of content and future with the game. Why get better at something that isn't growing? A new xpac and elite spec might bring people back, but more balance patches is just more of the same. There's nothing worth getting good for.
---
Most of the team at anet are young sjw hipsters
---
Both aspects, Bell Choir wins by far. Bell Choir is what, 20 presents and a few thousand karma in 4 to 6 minutes? (Varies depending on if you have to wait for players)
---
4 to 6 minutes is barely a snowball *match*
---
So you refute the conversation entirely by blunt declaration and deflect away from the matter at hand in favor of your particular narrative. I'm not contesting the fact that there is a measurable change in the rate of production from ArenaNet, but I do question whether or not we have excessively consumed the content presented. This isn't to the merit of ArenaNet, but rather to the potential judgement of the player base. People that have anecdotally established that the game is boring *may in fact* have exceeded a relationship between play time and content.
---
Yay, I'm really glad it's back! I didn't have a great experience last year, but I hope this year will be better. I always love Secret Santa events.
---
Why do you need so many ways to avoid combat?
---
No matter what I do, it won't let me log in after recreating my account. I've tried resetting the password, using different browsers (Chrome/Opera/Firefox), and disabling all extensions. It just sits on the Login screen and never seems to register that I clicked the "Log In" button. Is this a known issue that you're all looking into or something that I can work around in some way?
---
I fucking _love_ this shit.
---
To be fair the gap between Episode 1 and 2 falls into the time period in which they close the studio for several weeks and where already 2 fixed festival dates are present. So this might not be representative of the cadence going forward. I would be seriously surprised though, if we ended up with a frequency as high as you suggest. I think optimistically hoping for LS episodes every 2 Month, possibly aided by more substantive changes than the ones we are currently seeing in a current events style delivery in between is something that is achievable.
---
Bold are release months:
---
**September**, October, **November**, December, **January**
---
That's every 2 months. Not 3.
---
&gt; And it is NOT expanding maps, they take a full map and cut it in half! 
---
Potatoe Potahto, in all honesty. It's releasing the first half, then expanding it with the second half.
---
One can argue "they're releasing episodes at twice the rate of Season 4", or you can argue "they're releasing the same amount of content at the same rate as Season 4, but dividing releases in half to make twice as many releases".
---
It's just a glass half full versus glass half empty.
---
If the Icebrood Saga is less content than Season 3, so was Season 4. But Icebrood Saga is same amount of content as Season 4 overall.
---
^(Not that any of this comment will matter and you'll still whine doomsday game is dead nonesense.)
---
It was on par with bloodstone fen, but significantly shorter than most others. Let's hope the scope expands as the we get further into the saga, similar to how it did in LS3.
---
Twilight oasis is not a long fractal though. The boss fight is long, but I see no way to split the fractal in a sensible way without making the first half laughably easy.
---
Visions of the Past sounds pretty interesting
---
Naaaaaah
---
If they're not on the list it's because they probably aren't coming any time soon.
---
I don't give two fucks about these characters and playing with a set skill bar sounds boring as fuck.
---
I am actually glad, I can just move to other things and come back 3 months from now.
---
So I can only say I think the current elite specs should be balance first before adding more only has validity if it is on the roadmap thing they posted? I'm really missing how that invalidates my point. Could you explain it to me?
---
theyre lagging
---
less violets more violence
---
No, that is quite okay to be the hero that did all that. What's not okay is that I have to talk shit to some charr freaks and explain myself for treachery and collect lame stuff and whatnot like a total noob.
---
Heck! I killed 3 elder dragons! I killed Balthazar! I killed the undead Palawa Joko! I own my own dragon. I'm leader of Edge of Destiny!
---
If you have a f\*cking problem then get over it, or I'll drop havoc on you and your lands!
---
Twilight Oasis is pretty fast since they removed the second enemy. You just need to know the shortcut to the last enemy. (It's super quick if you got someone who can portal you.)
---
Exactly, it happens to me all the time. And for some reason the only way to be normal agian is no just to re enter the game, I need to restart my computer.
---
I set my bar pretty low on that one.
---
I would say that people do like surprises, but there has to be a hint or **something**, anything to actually get possibly excited about. Saying "we have unannounced" stuff means nothing. Capes, for example, were unannounced, and while they were a long awaited cool thing they are also cosmetic stuff that ends up mostly in gemstore. They should mention what realm of content their "surprises" belong to at the very least, then that will actually get people interested or let them move on.
---
Do any of you think the F2P version with a full-game sub-fee route would have been viable? Or just a full on sub-fee?
---
He was but it was also a pretty shit comment to pick out of this post, which was already fairly disappointing at face value without having to make shit up. The part on the festival was saying they are actually adding some content to it to make it not just a glorified gold dump for two weeks. Then there was a bunch of other stuff.
---
Ya I think they said they abandoned having a dedicated guild team over a year ago. I doubt we'll ever get another guild hall.
---
I went beyond full ham sandwich building a full remake of Star Wars places in mine lol. Was hoping for more build limit flexibility. No Man’s Sky here we come haha.
---
FFXIV's main character is also mute most of the time and only "speaks" when you get a dialog option (or when retelling something off-screen). Which works really well actually. You essential control everything that you character says that way.
---
These "choices" obviously don't change the story but they let your character be slightly personalized. And for example most jokes are tied to dialog options so you can decide if you character makes a joke or not. The recent expansion had quite a few of those ... and they were all great.
---
Oh and the "Echo" power of the main character is a OP tool for telling the backstory of a character. And they don't overuse it, they usually only use it after you know a character already and not when they get introduced.
---
Yea, I'm glad we got one too
---
I opened 1k and got grenth recipe. It feels fucking awful to get a super rare drop and it sells for 2g. Thanks Anet, stay terrible.
---
GW2 events are always so fucking weird, unless you plan to win the lottery you always lose money from actually opening the containers you earn, and all events follow the same pattern. It's why I haven't done any event in years.
---
When you die and want to bail on the strike, you can use the guild hall.

---
It's so fucking cute
---
I don't know whats your problem here. The whole of lws5 will be as big as an expansion, minus the elite spec of cause... At least I think so.
---
GW1 had some of the best PVP, non-high barrier to entry formats in the industry, and stood in its niche of instanced play with optional challenging PvE.
---
GW2 is a complete abandonment of what made GW1, and only held up by whales from gamble boxes and an entire reward structure that now revolves around an economy meant to encourage cash to gem conversions.
---
GW2 is still hardly in the news, hardly popular, except it changed its focus to content with zero replay value as the challenge and instanced content focus was excised for the McDonald's equivalent of hand-held game design where failure is removed, effectively killing any incentive to return to the content as you never really have to progress or learn encounters anymore on most of the content. This is reflected in the abysmal quality of the player population whenever new challenging content is occasionally released.

---
How complex will it get for such a build? I've read alot about elementalist and engineer being the two most complex characters both of which being difficult to play. I think the expression used was something along the lines of. "Playing Beethoven 5th." In terms of how much you had to do on your keyboard. Which is a bit of a daunting task to say the least.
---
You cant beat the mistlock sanctuary pass key without getting rid of fractals or making a second set of fractals elsewhere. The best way to get gems out of players who already have a mistlock sanc pass is to just put a portal to a nearly identical gamemode elsewhere, then make a convenience zone with a portal in there. Of course, this would cause outrage (that ultimately wouldnt change anything) if they just added a second, but different, fractal portal, so they have to rename it to Visions of the Mist or something similarly obvious but different, to avoid such (ineffective) community backlash.
---
thanks! it doesnt suit my wonder woman character, but i'm still wearing it the entire silly season
---
And weekly gemstore.
---
I wouldn't expect gw3 to happen at this point.
---
People are in for such a rude awakening if they ever find a way to bring LS1back in a playable form. The game was easily at it's worst state back then.
---
Most of season 1 content was just zerg events. I'm not sure if its reasonable to bring it back permamently in the way it was back then.
---
what a retarded statement
---
Ya I was absolutely floored when I started playing Destiny 2 and found that not only do they sell their funbux in a clean 1:10 ratio, they actually do their salami slicing by giving you extra silver when you buy a certain amount  
---
Bought $10 worth for one of the expansions and they gave me an extra $1  
---
Warframe having constant discounts on their currency similarly shocked me
---
you made garfields instead of charrs
---
You don't know that.

&gt;we want to play it again after so long
---
If you want to play on EotM then there's nothing stopping you. If what you really want is an easy farm map then I'm going to give you a bit of a side eye. The issue with EotM has always been that it's not a particularly good WvW map which is why it was used as a map to farm either karma, levels or WvW rank. If you remove the farm and leave it in its base state as a WvW map, then it resumes its current state which is a map that people don't actually want to play on. So, by all means, if you actually want to play on EotM then you can absolutely already do that.
---

---
Don't take this the wrong way, but it looks to me like you are WORKING and not playing. You are missing a good part of the GAMING experience. 
---
My advice: When you play the game (ANY GAME), forget everything else. You are here to have fun. Not document your work time (even if it is a game work time for achivs or crafts).
---
20 years ago, I was doing something similar, but from the time I stopped, I started enjoying gaming way more.

Welcome to the community! We've set a lower limit of 10g for the gifts. Hopefully that's something you have. When people sign up, they write a little note about what they wish for, so you're not entirely alone in figuring that out 😊
---
They should put back the reward pips or add something to reinvigorate attention in this map. But no true WvW player would ever want EotM to be reworked as a borderland. There is so much bloat on that map... it's rarely any fun to play.  
---
One thing I would like from EotM would be to add the different aesthetics of each half of the map into the core WvW maps. That is to say the jungle, desert and artic themed keeps and stuff for green, red and blue. I'd love a bit more personality like that in core WvW.  
---
Honestly though, EotM is dead and gone, anet really cant afford to split the already pathetically small WvW fan base anymore.

GW2 allows stacking. Therein lies the problem, pure and simple.
---
Uhhhhh I think you might need to go back to preschool and learn to count... This isn't the same update speed. So far, this is every other month. Previously, it was about ever 3.5-4 months.
---
It's not "white knighting", you're just objectively incorrect lol.
---
When I first read your comment, I thought it was a satirical piece about using your own brain to map out what you've already done. Only to Google and find out you were talking about an actual app!
---
Imagine unironically wanting them to waste resources on eotm.
---
why is their marketing team so bad
---
That's a tanuki
---
Anet's release of the build templates shows us the future of GW2 - monetize the shit out of everything.  I don't think we will ever see wvw improvements, wvw alliances, raids, fractals, etc. since all this stuff is "free" and doesn't have a way to be monetized.
---
Imagine a new fractal or raid being released but you had to pay 1600 gems to unlock it.  I don't think Anet has reached EA levels of monetization, but we're heading there...
---
See, I'm usually the pessimist one and I like that you guys are being realistic here, but I'll try to be hopefull for holidays. 
---
I like that they are trying to push something out at least every month. Even faster would be even better. I have liked the balance changes a lot in PVE and I hope for same treatment elsewhere.
---
 
---
Fixing stuff doesnt sound much but without something new it at least feels like they are trying to fix some things now, and trying new things again. That has always been Anet we love - trying new things, being different and brave. 
---
Like before - Some things they try will fail for sure but they have showed us before that even with our doubt they can deliver  quality and make heads turn. I just really hope they still have the early days passion to make this best MMO in the market, It sure needs hard work but it can be done. After all actions for the game are what matters - not words.
---
but it was begining of september and its end of January so its 3 months - whole september, whole november and whole Jaruary. So 3 months but less story and smaller maps when season 3 or 4? sad
---
Episode 3 should be March if they stick to the current schedule of an episode every other month, and festivals leapfrogging in between.
---
D: I cant I am alone, and I dont have job or money, I am sad , lonely and my favourite game is abandoned, they are not working on it. They are just throwing some bones , and even less then they were in season 3 or 4. Its sad
---
whole september of wait - 1
---
whole november - 1
---
whole January - 1
---
1+1+1 = 3?
---
That wildstar death
---
&gt;The first festival of 2020 will be Lunar New Year, **starting soon after the holiday break**.  
---
No, actually I simply read the news text.
---
&gt; At least before Alliances
---
So you have many years!
---
Again, you need to go back and learn to count. It wasn't "whole September" or "whole November". They came out in in the third week of the month. 
---
**Sept 17th      Episode**
---
October       *(63 days)*
---
**Nov 19th       Episode**
---
December   *(70 days)*
---
**Jan 28th        Episode**
---
I get that you really want to be right about this because you hate Anet or something, but you're just provably wrong.
---
Here are [my family's spreadsheets.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YZmMkWAYvfc23Eb1EAelg6ijLq_rzhiNgm6k4upj_Nw/edit?usp=sharing) It hasn't been updated in a long time and is woefully out of date. It is a mess with experimental sheets and other assorted crap. I believe it was last updated about 4 years ago.
---
Nerfing the warclaw is the final nail in the coffin for WvW for me. Moving in WvW is such a pain and removing the only decent thing they've added to address that issue simply means that it's pointless to play WvW anymore. And I was so close to rank 2000 for the armor - too bad guess I'm gonna go play other games.
---
other companys see that too and they do not simply partner up with someone who has nothing much to offer.  
---
take for example a bigger company like samsung. they have ads everywhere already, so what do they gain...1 million (not even sure that gw2 has so many) active players is not that much, they probably see ads of samsung already somwhere else and i bet the consistency between user groups is also highly fluctuating. like age range for example. if you have a product which is targeted at lets say female in the range of 30 - 50, why bother to team up with anet.  
---
while the marketing was always really bad in gw2, the other question is: does someone even want to partner up with anet? do they have to offer anything?
---
[Damn boi he thicc!](https://youtu.be/arnWU1sWqKw)
---
It's a Bibarel!

Quickness on attunement swap
---
The dream
---
The issue I see with Raids/dungeons and Fractals is you need to give people a reason to go through the extra effort to do them. There's so many other ways to get ascended gear and the best skins are on the Cash shop, so what's the reason to do them?
---
I imagine strikes were created because they're short and easy. Easy for the DEVS to make and easy for the casuals to join/complete, just like a regular world boss.
---
GW2 can't copy WoW/FFXIV because those two are traditional gear grind MMOs and GW2 is... something else.
---
I have 3 codes available as well if anyone actually wants them
---
At least the ones that are left want...
---
I personally couldn't imagine wvw without a mount, the maps are huge  (the desert being the worst of all) and they do need something to get around BUT the way the warclaw was implemented killed wvw. Being able to just hop on your warclaw and run away is totally defeating, but it's also bad in the way that some classes lack the ability to dismount you if they're on foot. I personally think the new hook skill should replace the door pull since it's entirely useless and lower the point cost on the hook so more people have the ability to use it. Thus making the warclaw less effectice than it is now.
---
huh?
---
wow an actual decent partnership
---
for those that don't know tidal offers higher quality than spotify
---
&gt; What?!
---
Does it have a tab for story yet that I missed? I know they made it possible to track story progressio via API. Also, map completion overview isn't available there (I love efficiency, it's just way different than OPs spreadsheet)
---
If anyone's interested....my equipment consists of:
---
* Head: Bloodstone visage
---
* Shoulder: Triumphant Hero's Pauldrons
---
* Chest, Hand, Legs: Luminescent armor
---
* Feet: Radiant Greaves
---
* Axe: Astralaria
---
* Shield: Glint's Bastion
---
* Dies: Celestial Blue &amp; Electro Pink
---
Surprises don't make people interested in the game. For example, look at the griffon mount. It could have been a central part of the PoF marketing, look at how awesome our flying mount is!
---
Instead, they hid it "because surprise" and no one gave a damn. It generated zero interest, zero engagement, and zero hype. Things need a buildup to generate activity.
---
Well, if you didn't have all that crap, this would be a single player game. There's a reason why being a "renown world saving hero" doesn't work at MMOs, and that's why.
---
Correct.
---
Or just don't let warclaws damage walls in the first place, that chain thing is dumb as shit.
---
You know what would be cool instead? Let us use that chain to pull people from up the walls, or to disable siege (connect chain to siege, siege stays disabled while you stay mounted nearby).
---
I don't know if that's just how the game/community works but I've literally never been able to join any raids. But then again maybe I just specifically had very unfortunate encounters and I was just unlucky.   
---
In any case, my point still stands. The optimized builds are just not fun to play for me, and I feel like it's difficult to get accepted by the community playing anything suboptimal
---
I'll see what I can do on this front
---
&gt; a simple issue of balance
---
What game are we talking about, again?
---
It's a care bear cookie!
---
&gt; Many players cannot help approaching a game as an optimization puzzle. What gives the most reward for the least risk? What strategy provides the highest chance – or even a guaranteed chance – of success? Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game
---
This is true in every game, no matter how hard devs try to balance things, players will *always* find the optimal routes/builds/equipment.
---
If you play in competitive modes/instances you have a responsibility to be decent in respect to the other members of your team, but those modes are a tiny percentage of the game *in this game*.
---
I find open world gives you a lot more freedom and customization then other MMOs I've played, you do have room to experiment and find what's fun to you and it never happened to me that someone criticized what I was doing.
---
If you're complaining about not being able to bring "your fun builds" into a raid, that's a different matter.
---
Just remove stealth, teleports and invulnerabilities.
---
Truth will make you free.
---
I might attempt to find a build/profession that resonates with me more, thanks for the suggestion!
---
[removed]
---
Those group leaders are wannabe tryhards who think double druid is the way to go but have no clue about the game. As long as you  quickness and alacrity second healer can be anyone. Scepter/warhorn tempest heal can provide perma 25 might, fury and protection.
---
The only boss where you "need" two druids is Largos because the group has to split.
---
Me. I want to rotate my decorations in all 3 axis. No more stupid limits, I hate when single candle takes same space (for system) as giant joko statue.
---
Soo much things could use an upgrade in guild halls..
---
I get what you're saying, in response to messages such as these I added a new edit all the way on the top of the original post, I suggest reading that!
---
It's just like the build templates that they recently released. They aren't actually templates, they're loadouts.
---
Same here. This isn't a roadmap, it's a bunch of things that are being released some time in the next 3 months.
---
Maybe this sub will finally acknowledge gw2 is end of life
---
This is a hint that Glyph of the Tides will be buffed.
---
And to be honest... Aside from some open world things, it should not be that hard to bring the content back. Even if we ignore the two dungeons of LW1, that are now fractals, why not just put the marionett Event back in the game?
---
All the open world events with the northern refugees could also have a revival with the current storyline. And the raid on LA could exactly be that... A raid. Not 10 man but for full squads instead. The base of old LA still exists as seen in some personal story missions.
---
And while they are at it, introduce a new "current event" to clean and rebuild Kessex Hills.
---
Yeah, and it points exactly to the emptiness of the game. You got "stuff to do", but it's (mostly) nothing meaningful. And that's why a lot of people get the mood they are in.
---
I like EOTM a lot more than any borderland. I wish Anet would actually do something with that map.
---
&gt; survived only because
---
Because there is no proper PvE competitor with equally good combat system. Thats the only reason.
---
I didnt play icebrood saga so i dont know how its looking, but season 2-4 had a lot of content not dedicated to zerging. Even zerg content in newer seasons are better in one way or the other, a little bit more complex. All season 1 events (except lions arch attack) were group up -&gt; press one button till x dies -&gt; go to another place and repeat that. I remember very well that people were not happy with most of those events and there is very little reason to bring it back. I guess tower of nightmares and attack on lions arch are the only events worth bringing back, the rest is either not worth development time or already recycled and part of different seasonal events.
---
Don't delete the characters you have already, even if you stop playing them, you'd miss out on [birthday gifts](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Birthday_Gift).
---
Soon Warclaw will become nothing more than a secondary healthbar. Mobile builds can already outrun the warclaw pretty easily
---
Looks like that ugly beaver guild emblem.
---
I definitely wasn't planning on doing such a thing, but thanks for the tip anyway!
---
When a new game releases they'll have to atleast have a decent base game. As a working adult I don't have the time to no life till max so yea i'm sure it'll take more then 3 weeks when you take in account different classes. I maxed everything out class wise &amp; gear wise before PoF since its so easy and they drown you in pink gear.
---
No... Just no... Arena Net announced Alliances in January 2018 and they gave us an update that they are working on it in July 2018. They layoffs happened in February 2019. If it takes them this long to implement a single feature, then there are more issues than the layoffs.
---
Well... They also need over 9 months to finalize one raid or fractal at minimum... And thats really sad considering that other MMO's don't have much bigger teams but still manage it to release three times the content Arena Net does... And yes, I am talking about FFXIV with around 200 people working on it.
---
The bonus mission pack came with amazing weapon skins for each of the stories though. So if it is like that, then it's reasonable to expect to get some kind of unique reward out of it.
---
Too much wintersday cookies for that chart.... Lol
---
dw wvwers like the grind cause they did it already so they can get pissy and dont want anyone in "their" game mode, but the warclaw is unbalanced as fuck and should have some of its spells removed particularly 1 and 2
---
Everyone's saying it looks like a choker, but I think it looks like a charr fresh from getting blowdried.
---
:(
---
Do I really need to specify "casual open world PvE"? Everyone calls Raids "hardcore content" anyway,
---
Tbere should be a little arrow when you hover over the chat tab that let's you customize the tab. Just disable fight/ combat, whatever it was called and you're good.
---
That's why lunar new year exists, to give players back the gold they wasted during the year.
---
I guess "Visions of the past" was the project of the fourth team.
---
It looks like the Tiger from Fivel Goes West.
---
Not in the chat, the floating text above enemies.
---
You think WvW is dead because of warclaw? It's dead because it's been abandoned for years and everyone stopped caring about the gamemode.
---
I see you like foxes uwu
---
Ok so if I understood you correctly you can't raid because raids require builds more focused towards a specific roles you have to build, but those builds don't suit you? Well that is the point of Raids. You have to know what your role is, what your class does, knowing how to play your class and knowing what the mechanics of the bosses are. Its "high end PvE content". Pugging can sometimes lead to party wipes which is frustrating for raiders, and because of that they ask for LI to make sure the person joining knows at least something. High end content is less flexible but more dynamic and mechanically complex which requires more optimization than open world.
---
They are just getting downvoted into oblivion. But they are still here.
---
It's just funny to watch GW2 become to an game that has more updates to it's gem store than some mobile games that were made for a quick cashgrab in form of microtransactions.
---
That! I hate that! AGhhhhhh!
---
Why do I have to exploit the environment / bring a chrono to get through a daily?
---
Not sure if memeing
---
He ate too many cookies!
---
i hope u never step into fractals or raids, or any group content
---
So is this a trusted thing by the community? I'm a casual player with a bit of in-game wealth that I've been wanting to share
---
Do they even have a fractal team anymore?
---
ANET always trying to *replace* something what working,with something new periodicly. it doesnt work and it retarded. strikes are MEGA fail.
---
Yeah but don't forget that there was no raids in 2012- 2015 at all. And  game was actually fine. This game was never about group pve. Don't be delusional. It was always more about story, open world and pvp. Nothing new here. So hoping that it will change is not smart at all. 7 years of GW2 showed what's their direction and it won't change just like that. IMO there was little chance that it will change in 2015/2016 when they was pushing new raids so hard. But in 2017 it was obvious that raids won't be a thing in this game. Of course they will probably release w8 someday. But does it going to change anything in their approach? No. You'll clear w8 in max 1 week and then wait year or two for next one. That's reality.
---
Thats directed to Automated Tournies, not ranked matches. The issue seems to be fixed now but its still subjective.
---
Just remember to not get disheartened by bad experiences or toxic groups; you won't find a single game without those and GW2 is no exception. Keep an open mind and join as many training groups as you can, eventually you'll find positive people and have tons of fun.
---
Knowing how good gw2 could be with the profit that WoW and FF make from sub fees I would definitely agree. The problem is surely the risk of so many people never trying the game long enough to find it worth playing. Maybe if they did a 3 month sub comes with game purchase thing.
---
graphic design IS your passion
---
Very impressive, I really like the infusion squares addtion in the Equipment window. I'm not convinced by the "Effect Summary" thought.
---
The Build window looks really good and compact
---
In the same way you added Novelties to the Wardrobe section, I would love to have the option to set different glider/mounts skins depending on my build. Gotta have the bubble glider when Im on my healing Tempest, and the Geomancer one when Im condi Weaver, ya know ?
---
Trash
---
ノಠ益ಠノ彡┻━┻
---
Stacking staff weavers was barely ever optimal! You almost always wanted things like renegades, DHs, holos, in some occasions even an additional war
---
I don't know I've never played this game
---
No different than past records were Ele was stacked. Usually, DPS slots are filled with whats best
---
Arc is usually updated within a day of any patch that breaks it, so yes.
---
Make it orange with black stripes and serve it with lasagna as a side.
---
That is a new feature that tells you if your details have been leaked. I don't think it will tell you which site leaked, but it will warn you to not use them. You should check https://haveibeenpwned.com/
---
I was hoping this was exactly what I thought it'd be and I was not disappointed
---
As far as I can tell, he's different to other bounties in that it takes way longer to reset, because it doesn't have just a reset cooldown like other bounties, it has both a reset cooldown and a reset window.
---
It will take quite a long time for the event to refresh, and once the even is off cooldown, it won't reset until the next reset window, which I believe is sometime around dusk or midnight.  
---
So if the fight starts around his reset time, it can skip a reset window because it won't reset while the even it up, and it'll take an extra window to reset. If someone goes and starts it without people, they will fail it, and then anyone else who wants to do it will have to wait another 2 hours for another try. 
---
I'd recommend waiting for the Desert Highlands Bounty Hunter daily achievement, as it will be more likely that people will organize and set tags to defeat the bounty together, and there may be more instances of the map, which translates into more possible attempts if people across instances join in squads to pick and choose maps.
---
I don't think I've ever met a player who has disliked the EoTM maps on aesthetics alone. Anet is sitting on a game-mode that could, in theory, bring a lot of players back in to revitalize, if they simply took some time to rework some things.
---
Oh boi "Toxic Raiders", here we go again, definitely not a sensitive Topic on here… 
---
There is (was?) massive amounts of discussion around this, so aside from some of your examples only applying on first sight, ill give you a tl;dr: 
---
This community had MASSIVE Problems with the exact Kind of Thing youre Talking About.   
---
A lot of it Comes from the vanilla, "Core Game" basically requireing nothing but AAs for Combat.   
---
A lot of it actually Comes from overoptimization like you said. 
---
"Raiders are toxic!" and "Casuals are lazy!" is what the discussion quickly devolved into after the harsh spike in demand raid content delivered. Both sides have some truth to them. 
---
In General, I'd recommend you stay out of PUG raiding ^((unless ist Training runs))   
---
and dont join fractal Groups that have "EXP" or lots of overly specific requirements in the Group description ^((personal experience: the more requirements besides "P+F", "DPS" or "Healer", the higher the Chance of at least one Group member being toxic))   
---
for now.   
---
Fractals (and, in static/willing squads, Raids) are very much playable in off-meta builds, you just gotta pick the right group, or start your own - they fill up quickly, usually. 
---
The meta also isnt as restrictive as LFG makes it seem!   
---
Almost every Elite Spec has multiple builds laid out for many gamemodes, and most of them you can pick multiple sub-specs that still do very well, or doctor around on them until youre having fun.   
---
You also dont Need to run the hyperoptimized variants. Many offer a minor Damage upgrade at the cost of Major QoL loss, which can be ignored if youre not going for a speedclear or enjoying it. 
---
A last tip:   
---
The whole game is beatable in shitty gear with shitty builds - but when someone isnt willing to communicate in any way, they likely have no idea what theyre doing, are not willing to learn and will probably drag the entire team down.
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?

Been out of the game for a bit. Did they ever drop the big fucking patch for alliance wvw yet or it's still a myth and everyone who plays wvw has dwindled to oblivion?
---
I... uuh... uhm... that... t-that's from, uh... Fortnite.

You're.. reading into it to much

For a second I thought Tidal was a laundry detergent and this 60 day trial was for Guild Wars 2 the game. lol

Still a myth.

Skinboner v2 inc
---
How? All I want to do is kill people, and have fights. It allows people to runaway and not engage in combat.
---
Interesting, thank you!
---
Yeah noone cares
---
It was standard Chrome. But I think it has less to do with your site and more with the e-mail address I used, as RandommUser suggested.
---
Keep it up :)
---
How about using the lance skill?.. Btw if you just want to kill people go play pvp.
---
Exactly. GW2 "surprises" last less than 24h, as soon as they're found out and posted all over the place, making them pointless to begin with.
---
A good buildup hypes players across a long span of time, and its effect eventually reaches potential new players outside our bubble. There's literally ZERO official footage of the griffon being awesome, ZERO. One of the best features the game has gotten, and it has zero marketing material to sell it to new players. Hell, most people still don't know, 2 years later, how to properly use the griffon skills. That's how bad it is.
---
I did that on paper, because i have 27 character, but in the last 2 years i focused on trying to 100% with one per class, so i had to write down stuff to help me tracking their progress.
---
The sad part is that this chart made me realize how much i played HoT [maps and story] compared to Pof, where i just unlocked maps with my 2 mains and did the story with 1 of those.
---
Oh, and i don't care anymore about vigil\priory\whispers, it had somehow sense at the beginning, now i just go vigil because i remember the missions and i'm quicker when i decide do progress their story.
---
....selbbub?

Didn't asura's ass were that big.
---
Cha Cha Cha, Charmin
---
we learned during PoF that if we kill any more dragons than the two we already did tyria, as in the planet, is at risk of getting destroyed due to the explosive overflow of magic. we still proceeded to kill kralkatorrik in S4 because we had aurene who could potentially replace him and still be on on our side, and kralkatorrik himself, due to having consumed the mistwalker that was balthazar, was a threat to not only tyria itself, but also the mist and any world beyond it.
---
we succeeded with aurene taking her grandfather's place and all was in balance so we wouldn't have to deal with any elder dragon for the foreseeable future and anet could finally focus on creating new lore for previously unexplored areas... except they didn't and just randomly made another dragon (jormag) active again and went back to milking that nostalgia boner, which is where we are today. welcome back, enjoy your ride.
---
Easy! \^\^
---
thats such bs,its almost funny :DD ever heard of fortnite,HOTS,STRIFE? you know that small indie companies which add something new every few months and ITS BIG and you know .. those games are COMPLETLY FREE.
---
Well you can also just use the white mantel portal. (Easily the most OP item for fractals.)
---
I'm at nearly the exact hour count as you and I've had this game since launch. Still never raided, though. Lol. Played GW1 for 2000hrs and got a guild wars quarter sleeve tattoo. Huge fan but I don't play for long periods so whenever I come back, there's a whole new season and a bunch of system upgrades to learn. Always feels new and fresh to me. That may be one of the benefits of not being consistent, I can't relate to a lot of complaints that I've seen over the years. Not to say they aren't valid, but I simply don't know enough to recognize any of it.
---
Balthazar is dead? Has anything happened with the other human gods?

I Support Cookie the chubby charr

Elementalist has more weapon skills than other classes (save kit-based Engineer, as you mention), so it is by nature more complex.  Where other classes have two weapons to swap between each ten seconds for a total of 10 weapon skills in any given fight, Elementalist has just one weapon but four elemental attunements to swap between, with a lower cooldown than 10 seconds, giving them 20 weapon skills to access.  Weaver then ups the ante more by modifying the attunements such that each swap only swaps half of the skills, creating a hybrid elementalist who might be attuned to two elements at once, with weapon skill 3 changing based on the exact two elements being used to use aspects of both.  This gives them even more than 20 weapon skills (not going to do the math for exactly how many), and means you need to be precise to get the abilities you want at the time you want them, and to cycle through all of your options.
---
So yes, it'll be complicated.  If you have Path of Fire already, you can go into the PvP lobby and equip Weaver there on a test character to examine it for yourself, just bring a cheap sword to equip to see the melee skills.  The Weaver changes do affect each Elementalist weapon, but from what you're saying you want melee so Sword would be your preferred weapon choice, and it's quite strong too.
---
Hello Piken friend :/.
---
I so wish they would give us a personal dps check. Like the number in chat we get on the golem. If we could get them in chat when ever we fight would be so good.
---
"barely enough to not anger people enough to forcibly remove you from the group" isn't a metric you should strive for. No one is saying you need perfect DPS, but at least pretend to try.
---
I agree, we really do need a pet-focused ranger specialisation. Both current ones focus away from having an animal companion.
---
I had one but decided to reroll after repeatedly being told to kill myself
---
I mean, we have a whole [family](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bird#Pets) of bird pets. But they don't have that perching animation.
---
That char has the beetus.
---
It's just their winter coat, all fluff
---
That's a relief! For us at least. As a side note I would strongly suggest using a password manager like 1Password, LastPass or any other. It's actially something I'll give to my parents and in-laws (incl. setup) this Christmas!
---
Fractals? Raids? :(
---
A traited Tempest with the right stats heal by far more then a Druid. Tempest also catching up on the buffs because of recent ballances but we still do not have any grace of land or spirits and why druids keep their spots. In fractals i prefer having a firebrand or tempest over druid at any point.
---
only exception to that rule is LNY, which so far also consisted of virtually nothing but buying your daily envelopes. frankly after the "roadmap" i'm a bit worried they mess those up...
---
Zerg busting, pissing off the trolls in map chat.
---
Well, I was just joking because I never played during that meta but that sounds about right
---
For a second I though they had partnered with Tide.
---
Dont you need gifts to give the orphans? Or how exactly does it work?

I've helped out in training groups where they had no problems learning mechanics and surviving to enrage...but they _hit enrage_. DPS isn't the most important thing in raids, but you should care about it at least a little.
---
that option only allows you to revert back to the old condition floaters, which actually obstruct even more of the scene (they are more fun to look at though)
---
GW1 got abandoned and went into maintenance mode. Gw2 follows GW1.
---
Thank you!
---
Wow, it looks like me.
---
I'm suspicious of the RNG box tables I see on Reddit.  "See, it's totally not worth it for you to unlock all these boxes.  Here's a table I made up and conveniently omitted anything valuable.  You might as well send them to me."
---
I'd actually recommend a blue headpiece to go with the rest of your stuff. The red eyes don't entirely fit.
---
Thanks!
---
Snow Crows is the preferred build site on current raid meta builds, and you should grab a build from there to work towards to. They refer you to the correct consumables, runes and sigils as well as everything else. Ascended is recommended eventually, but exotics are plenty enough for a beginning raider. YouTube has plenty of good guides for all the raid encounters, I personally prefer the video format as text-only guides tend to get a little confusing.
---
There are tons of training guilds that advertise in the Aerodrome, you can also ask to join one in the map chat or the forums section. Joining a training guild is highly recommended if you're serious about getting into raiding, as they will likely have the most competent teachers. There are also training groups in the LFG regularly that only require you to have a build that makes sense (as in a clear purpose with correct stats and traits; dps, healer, boon support etc). I've hopped in to tons of these and success is not always guaranteed, but I've had a ton of fun and learned a lot. Don't hesitate to jump in when you see these! I've also created my own "everyone welcome" squads every now and then if no training runs have been open at that time, and I've had a surprising amount of success with those. So creating your own group is definitely an option, but you should learn about the wing beforehand to be able to explain mechanics and general tips to the rest of the group.
---
The most important thing is not to get disheartened by negativity. You'll meet a bunch of toxic jerks on the way, but don't allow it to let you down. Keep your mind open and try to learn something from every wipe, and you'll be a competent raider in no time. Good luck!
---
come play competitive and you will know how much the numbers matter when there are builds that can heal to 100% in .5 seconds and then put up 50% barrier.
---
is the login down? nothing happens when i press log in with the correct email + pw.
---
or does it not support chrome?
---
There's no need to unlock them if you not plan to raid
---
so fluffy, must be charr from north!
---
There is normally 10+ teams per AT
---
What are you talking about? Clearly the endgame content is gem store. Haven't you seen how much care is put into pumping it full of unique items, as opposed to working on the rest of the fucking game?
---
Embrace the 20XX gaming and pull out your credit card.
---
The tolerances on printers are as good as you calibrate them. They can be off by several mm, or that can be precise down to 0.01 mm, depending on your machine and your pickiness with precision.
---
Also, don't blame the machine for poor modeling. If they didn't give the cutter a cutting edge, that's not the printer's fault, it's the person's.
---
Yeah this. The actual piece itself is surprisingly durable and weve used the same printer before to make parts for old machines. It just doesn't have a proper edge because we didnt make one
---
They should add a rental already. Some absolutely irrelevant cost like 10 badges of honor and you get a "base" warclaw until you leave WvW / for a few hours. I think it's fair to expect people to put work/time into getting / training the mount but it can be really hard to catch up to your zerg if you don't have it, especially if you're new.
---
Seconding the request for the file, or a link if ya'll are kind enough to put it up on Thingiverse.
---
&gt; In WoW each class has 3 trees, only one is meta for the role.
---
No shit sherlock when the other two trees are for different roles.
---
My friend you should get out more.
---
tell me more about the different roles of a hunter or a warlock
---
"saNTa", not "saTaN"
---
Snow Crows is a website by the top-tier raid speedrun guild of the same name. I'm not sure exactly for how long they've been in business, but for a while anyway.
---
And no, off-meta definitely does not mean non-viable. Most groups with experienced players will demand kill proofs and a strict meta build to go with them, but it's definitely not the only option to raid.
---
&gt; Or better can you share your priest tank please
---
I fail to see your point because both holy and disc are very much playable right now *in the same role*.  
---
While you are at it, do tell me how my paladin has three DPS specs, I'm waiting.
---
🦀 EANET WON'T READ THIS POST 🦀
---
Honestly? Not really. Swapping some lines here and there and its completely scripted. You barely make any decisions like u used to do in personal stories. Its just a playable movie.
---
For boss guides you can try look here:
---
http://dulfy.net/category/gw2/raid-guides/
---
It doesn't have last raid wing, and some tactics are maybe little outdated but it explain all mechanics.
---
For heal tempest, I wouldn't  recommend build from snowcrows, the staff is better for beginners, no point of going dagger/warhorn if you have a druid in the raid and no need going full harrier especially if you start with exotic armor. 
---
Build from metabattle would be much better for typical casual raiding group:
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Tempest_-_Support_Healer
---
Yeah, I remember stopping a bit after that announcement saying I’ll be back to try out alliances... lol
---
Autmod didn't let me post this so if anyone can answer this here I would be grateful.
---
I just finished my personal story. I have the expansions HoT and PoF. I keep reading to buy living story s2 if I want the story to make sense, but since I already have those episodes should I just go straight into HoT or PoF? Also I've been thinking about going to the Whisper in the Dark from Iceborn Saga since it's apparently free for not so long? What do you recommend? Am I missing important stuff if I don't do the episodes in order?
---
In his case he could definitely use another source than snowcrows, since he is probably running a very safe comp at first where a staff full heal tempest might be better in combination with a druid.
---
Also for a beginners group i wouldn't call Heal Tempest + Druid off meta. In high end you definitely don't want to have 2 healers but at the beginning this is a very solid choice.
---
About snowcrows: the idea to tell him to look up snowcrows was following: he might be willing to learn other classes or gear them up and there [snowcrows.com](https://snowcrows.com) is way more polished than metabattle, also you get a better overview how to use your build on specific bosses and how to do a proper rotation, which is on most classes as important as the build if not more.
---
or you could just stop wasting money on gemstore garbage
---
You're confusing tolerance and accuracy.
---
You have no idea how mistaken you are with your statement. New e-speces would drive away a lot of people from the game (especially wvw and pvp), because they would be unbalanced af (as proved with how HoT and PoF are still UNFIXED/UNBALACED since their release). On top of that they would need to compete with current "All-In-One" packs from both expansions which won't be easy without implementing some another broken mechanics...
---
First thing that need to happen before even considering next e-speces is BALANCE for ALL current CLASSES.
---
Incoming GW2 for Google Stadia announcement.
---
Lol, nice counter argument there ^^
---
Exactly. FFXIV already does that for EVERY expansion. With purchase, you get a free month of Sub.
---
Please remember there is a max of 3 warclaw chains per gate.
---
3 warclaws matching one superior flame ram won’t change the current dynamic of taking towers and keeps imo.
---
What's the best guide to do the griffon collection? I'm like halfway through following the dulfy one, but it's very inefficient since it is in order of collection and it often makes me go to a place 5 cms close to another one I've already visited.
---
I second this advice! A little time in the freezer before baking should solve the problem!
---
you buy 30 rolls of wrapping paper for ~15k karma, and 30 wintersday weapons for another ~15k karma; so **30k total**.  
---
There are 30 orphans throughout DR, and each gives 1500 karma **without boosters**, so a full run gives you **45k karma**.  
---
But if you [maximise your karma gains](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Karma#Maximizing_karma_gain), you can get up to 3900 karma per orphans IIRC, so a full run yields more than 100k karma...
---
The rewards are worse and slower to get than PvE and there is no reward for being the better server. People who play WvW do it because they enjoy it but unfortunately it’s detrimental to advancing the rest of thier game
---
Uhh ok. Don't see what that has to do with my comment or the comment I replied to.
---
&gt; The optimized builds are just not fun to play for me, and I feel like it's difficult to get accepted by the community playing anything suboptimal
---
I think this is an interesting point of view considering FFXIV has no builds. There are different rotations, different gear priorities, different jobs(classes), but there are no builds.
---
Combat tab is also a thing..
---
100% legal.
---
Wealth applies in 2 ways here that you missed:
---
1.) A poor person would rely more on their family and parents than a rich one making harder to break off if they want. An asian billionare doesn't depend on anyone.
---
2.) Proggresivism is usually a luxury of wealthy people. Upper classes are more progressive while working classes are less. So, class is absolutely relevant here for this reason. Not all classes share the same views on all issues.
---
Its not simply that money makes things easier (which it aboslutely does) on a material level, its that the upper wealthier classes as a general rule of thumb also tend have different worldviews than the working classes.
---
1 flame ram is fairly strong against paper, it would make flipping paper much easier with roamers, think of it like this, 3 players at reset can go full havoc squad, they can hit and run on damn near anything, bay, gari, hills, it doesn't matter, it would be a war of attrition and would bust up the zergs as you cannot react that fast. There is simply too much power added to roamers by making it so 3 people can be a roaming free flame ram when you can build 1 guild ram with a claimed camp, that if destroyed makes them have to run back to a camp and try again. if that camp is empty then it's a long drawn out process which gives people time to react instead of going NWT to NET, then slamming into gari because why not then hills to SET. Eventually you will find a hole.
---
I saw a thread similar to this a couple days ago. No one could seem to figure it out just yet. You aren’t the only one. If I can find it again I’ll link you to it

EOTM is dead, give it up.
---
&gt; That was the point of my statement: emotional struggles like not knowing your place in the world or your connection to others are a universal human experience. 
---
Right, so that leaves the question of why do you need someone of a specific race to convey universal experiences? All the examples you've brought up so far are either universal experiences that don't require someone of specific characteristic, or issues that are far more correlated to class than any other characteristic.
---

---
About your story, that sounds like what the vast majority of teenagers go through. Everyone has ambitions and pressure placed upon their shoulder, everyone keeps secrets from their parents, and everyone finds shared intrest groups. 
---
Everyone can relate to keeping secrets from their parents.
---
Everyone can relate to having unique intrests.
---
Everyone can relate to feeling stressed due to expectations placed upon them.
---
Ironically, the only part of your story that not everyone goes through and is relatively unique is this:
---
&gt;To be honest, our relationship was strained after that, because I knew then that there were real differences between us - not just jokingly thinking she's classy for listening to Bach or whatever, but a real understanding that she comes from a rich family. I refused to ever let her visit my house because I didn't want her to know how different my life was from hers, and I was honestly ashamed of how dirty and poor I felt.
---
Your story isn't unique because you're gay or asian, its unique because of the class "clash" you experienced. That's an experience that is actually diverse, that's an experience that actually breaks from mold that not everyone can offer, because its not a universal experience like secrets, stress or expectations.
---
If there's something you can write a story about that actually offers a different perspective from most, this is it, and it stems from class, not personal identity.

Bring back the Lion's Arch fights and the Marionnette and I'll happily redo them. Those were some of the most badass open world bosses they ever did.

Of course, easier said than done, and I'm not saying "it's easy" or they actually should just bring those back without any other thought put into it, it's clearly something that'd need to be designed properly, maybe like the world boss guild activation, or some other form of specific LFG and timing. But those *were* great and I *do* regret not being able to play them again.

So, in essence, there are two builds for heal tempest, staff and dagger/scepter with warhorn. Staff heal tempest provides very high sustained healing and strong burst healing, dagger/warhorn sacrifices the level of sustained healing that staff provides along with limiting the access of burst healing due to following a rotation of sorts, but in retrun you gain the ability the carry boons such as might, fury, protection and regen for your squad, along with better (not good) personal DPS. Typically, if the group has good boon converage you should run staff, and if you're lacking boons you should run x/warhorn. It is also worth noting that x/wahorn has stronger CC (still lower than a lot of other offhealers). Now to answer your questions... You should use delicious rice balls with bountiful maintenance oil, don't be a cheapskate and use a concentration utility item because bountiful maintenance oil is very strong (outgoing healing). You can use exotics if you wish, although ascended is obviously better. For staff use full magis, and for x/warhorn use a mix of harriers with magis so you can cap boon duration. You definitely want monk runes though... As for tips, Metabattle might be a place to look, there are not really many resources out there for how to play Heal Tempest, although it's pretty obvious from reading how your skills work. Typically you will want to run water/arcane/tempest on both x/warhorn and staff. You can replace arcane with fire if you require condition cleanse on x/warhorn. On x/warhorn you typically run aura share in water along with aura on overload in tempest to provide more healing, on staff it's not necessarily and soothing power is better if you do not require additional condition cleanse. Just have a read of the traits and how they combo with your build, I'm not going to write a full description here. As for boss guides, I don't really know
---
Tune in next time on lunar new year when someone does this anyway.
---
It is a waste of gold but honestly, if you have that much, you probably don't have anything better to spend it on anyway. Teapots tourney would be a great idea imo but im poor.
---
Better than me ecto gambling that's for sure.
---
So only necro and thief don't require the expansions for their builds. Guess those are the only two classes I am going to be focusing on playing.
---
I have also heard that keeping dough cold by putting it in the fridge/freezer for a while before baking will keep it from spreading out. Your results are super impressive regardless!
---
There's also a core guardian build (https://www.godsofpvp.net/builds/guardian-core) and a core warrior build (https://www.godsofpvp.net/builds/warrior-core) on that site.
---
They're not getting a new map, the questing content takes place on 2 existing maps, right?
---
Still, they're getting a bunch of other content anyway.
---
Have you tried restarting your computer?
---
If all of the above + a restart doesn't work. Submit a ticket to support. 
---
Wish I could give you more things to try, but that's all I got.... Unless you want to try to download the .dat on a 64g flash drive. Maybe your HD is being weird.
---
Those are my guesses, sorry if they don't work : (
---
It's an issue that has been in the game for years and has no solution. Even the devs don't know what causes it. It sucks because I literally cannot the story without repeating some parts upwards of five times
---
Except they aren't really. They are one of the 3-4 items you get from the box, and guaranteed every box. So when you open a black lion chest, you are opening it for the statuette, the other guaranteed, and whatever rng you are hoping for.
---
u/Iviris Wrong on all counts. We haven't had interns at the company since 2018. The Narrative Dept. hasn't had an intern in something like 5 years.
---
Mentees don't work on the game at all.
---
u/DrMint Mentorship can be done remotely. We're not asking anyone to move to Washington.
---
u/FlameHamster Our hiring decisions are based primarily on ability and portfolio. Same with our mentorship applications. Read the article if you're unclear on the details.
---
True, but in a pvp setting, could bring a lot of different type of build.
---
Edit: where keg brawl only have a set of skill, and that is very limited.
---
I'd like to see Anet with a better release schedule if this is their new standard. They mentioned that episode 1 was shorter in exchange for getting episodes out faster.
---
Episode 2 is coming out just roughly half a month sooner than their usual release schedule of three months from Ls4. I'd rather pay another half-month of wait for a full map and longer episode. It's already dry enough with all this "expansion level content" getting released.
---
Yes. Because that's how you get people to try it out, and some of them stick around. One of the biggest problem WvW faces is a population one depending on your match ups. Ehmry Bay is fucking dead most of the time, so when I hop in to WvW to check it out and there isn't a single commander across all 4 maps, I'm not coming back until the next time I get curious. I know there are prime times, but not everyone plays those. Pvp I can hop in at any time to play a match.
---
I enjoyed EOTM when it was used as a place for leveling alts.

---
loving both, but GW1&gt;GW2
---
This isn't guild recruiting though, so I'm confused:(
---
I disagree. Theyve not said one way or the other at all, not even a hint. Its equally as possible as it is unlikely.
---
What I believe Ragnarok was suggesting is, Anet making on official statement on whether or not things like that are/could be coming - something as simple as "no, there will be no especs in the icebrood saga" - would go a long way in easing people's minds. I find it funny people wanted more especs, and now that icebrood saga is around, bringing "expansion like content" of sorts, people here are so adamant they aren't coming that anyone who even speculates about it gets downvoted into oblivion. You all are so contradictory, its hilarious. Its almost like you changed your mind, and you actually dont want especs, raids, fractals and so on. Hope goes a lot further than pessimism, just so you know.
---
This is the easy mode we've been requesting.
---
Because the protagonist is obviously meant to be human. Just look at all of Arena Net decisions.
---
So, I'm starting this game (no expansions unless I like it) and I'm not sure which class to play. Ultimately, I love earth/aqua/plant aesthetics and it seems Druid, Tempest, and Scourge kinda fit those based on the skills I read? Albeit Scourge is reaching because it's dark+sand, but I'll take it lol.
---
Anyway! Which of those 3 classes is best for a player who likes in lotsa pvp and ofc decent PvPing?
---
Is this supposed to be a 3rd (hybrid-)healer when your squad is so bad that 2 healers aren't enough? Or a 2nd healer when your squad isn't quite good enough for a solohealer?
---
I assume you have enough RAM and/or Virtual Memory free in case the game is trying to cache some of the downloaded data?  The amount that it is downloading and stopping at seems suspicious.
---
think of it as guildwars 2 recruiting and not an actual guild recruiting
---
besides, while a "static" might not necessarily be a /guild channel in game, you even described yourselves as a close-knit group
---
Well, Druid, Tempest and Scourge are all elite specializations, so if you aren't going to buy the expansions you aren't going to be able to play as those.  Ranger is still about the only class with 'plant' effects, while Elementalist has various earth and water spells, but Druid and Tempest will be out of your reach.
---
Beyond that... Ranger is a pet class and is balanced around that, so without getting the Soulbeast specialization (also requiring the expansions) you'll be depending to some extent on that AI pet to help you contribute with damage, and that brings some benefits and drawbacks.  Some people like pet classes, some people don't.  Elementalist doesn't have any such worries, but is a very fragile class, having both the weakest armour and the lowest HP of any class.  You'll need to learn your weapon skills well and make good use of the universal evasion system to survive.  It's definitely possible, but the learning curve is higher on that class because of it.
---
So which of those sounds better to you?
---
Looks more like a bad connection tome o.O I mean why use hacks if you just do the jumps anyways.
---
I certainly should. I've played GW2 before, and other than the SSD, without hardware change. I don't recall this trouble back then. I hadn't thought to check the virtual memory--will give that a peek. It's always something silly and small that seems to gum up the proverbial works.
---
I had this issue before and asking someone else to host the instance helped me.
---
The computer has had a couple restarts in between the download attempts. I do have a ticket submitted, but with the holidays looming, I was uncertain how well staffed they'd be, so I thought to reach out here as well, in the off chance someone else has had such similar troubles.
---
I guess the same.  risking to get banned to save like 10 seconds would be the most stupid thing ever.
---
they are moving way too fast, you don't gain permanent speed from bad connection. besides they wouldn't be seen jumping that frequently while having bad connection
---
Couple things to address here.
---
**You need to buy and play the Living World stories for the story to make sense**
---
They are not independent stories. They build off each other in one long continuous narrative.
---
If you jump straight into PoF, you'll be in the middle of the Maguuma jungle for reasons you dont know, fighting an enemy you dont know, trying to fix things you dont know.
---
If you dont care about the story at all there is no reason to hold off, but I am of the opinion the story gets pretty decent and not having the context will hurt enjoyment.
---
**Living World episodes are unlocked forever by logging in**
---
Whenever you log into the game, you get the latest episode, for free, forever. Meaning that you have Whispers in the Dark forever and will never have to pay for it. It is **not** the case that you can play it free for a limited time then you have to pay to continue after a certain date.
---
You have to buy episodes you completely missed, though.
---
Each week is a matchup and the reset is Friday night pacific timezone.  The matchups are separated into tiers.  The winner of a matchup goes up a tier, and the loser of a matchup goes down a tier.  This is a bit different for T1 and T4 because you can't go up and down from there.  People transfer, guilds transfer, there isn't much "server loyalty" anymore.  With that said, some servers are known for being more competent than others.
---
"Don't be shy. You can touch it." ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Lollll
---
I tried that the other day. I was able to blast around in the starting zone fine, but when it came time to leave zone, such hadn't been loaded. I let it sit for an hour, came back, and it was still loading said zone. That's when I knew something funky was going on.
---
trust me there is so many bots who do bell choir and no one knows about them
---
Snow crows? Never heard of it before now.  Thanks!
---
Which is funny because knives in csgo are at a 0.01% chance and still drop more than the ultra rares in this game like infusions, and they are 2.50 a pop for a chance.
---
Maybe we'll finally get to know who that nightmare court duchess from Dragon's stand is.
---
Not had exactly the same issues as you, but was doing raids and our entire squad had ridiculous ping spikes to the point where it was pretty unplayable at times. This was in the past hour
---
Yeah, that I've experienced before. But never so excessive and coupled with a full broadside of disconnects.
---
Based on the amount of posts about it (me), it's not that big of a deal.
---
Ah well.
---
Servers have been funky for a while now.
---
I'm getting flashbacks to Pony Island.
---
Well, "cast times" aren't really a thing in Guild Wars 2.  I guess Elementalist does have more cast time skills than other classes, but it's just on a few skills rather than all of them.  Those few skills tend to also root you in place when casting them, which again is something not many skills do in this game.  Even for the casting classes, mobility is very important.
---
If you don't like pet reliance, then skip Ranger/Druid.  It's a key component of the class.  It sounds like Elementalist would be your choice unless you wanted to hold out for Scourge.  While both Elementalist and Necromancer have the weakest armour, Elementalist also has the lowest HP as I mentioned before, but Necromancer has the highest HP, and the class mechanic of Death Shroud goes above and beyond that to provide a second HP bar that's generated by absorbing Life Force from enemies you kill.  So it's a much sturdier class despite being a 'caster', though it tends to lack the active defences most other classes enjoy.  While it can summon minions to assist, unlike Ranger those minions aren't class mechanics, just skills, skills you can simply choose not to equip and use if you don't want the hassle of critters following you.
---
As for difficulty, the base game that you'll be trying for free generally isn't very hard, but the difficulty ramps up in the expansions and can catch people off-guard, especially if they've developed bad habits in their play up to that point (things like not knowing how/when to dodge).  PvP is, of course, a different story.
---
You said, "balance \[current specs\] first before \[adding new ones\].
---
I am saying balance was thrown out the window since HoT. Furthermore, there are even vanilla skills or spec issues. It took them seven years to put burning on Guardian Torch#5. My point is that balance is not an issue when you have a poor track record as Anet. Therefore, balance before adding does not meet up in this situation since we know that balancing is least likely to happen.
---
Ugh those story instance crashes were the worst back then. You might be 99% done but a crash reset you to 0%.

At least these days they have a checkpoint system in place that mitigates that pain

It's been long confirmed that it's never coming back because of the controversy it would arise in the asian market.

---
There was a similar thread not long ago discussing this error, and someone had the same suggestion of playing Youtube videos in the background. I've had several characters stuck at various story parts that kept getting this error (in the Personal Story, in HoT, in PoF). When I tried playing a Youtube video on mute in the background, all of those instances played through without issue. If anyone gets this error during an instance I'd strongly recommend trying this solution first.
---
If you are wondering what makes these photos special, it's that the images are wide angle images shot at very low fields of view by using a technique that mimics anamorphic lensing.
---
Taking 3 photo's and stitching them together with image stereoscopy, yields you with a wide angle image, that removes rectilinear rendering distortion,and mimics curvilinear distortion. In other words, you can never replicate these shots in gw2 without going through this method.
---
Anamorphic lenses are common in filmmaking, and most of the great movies use these lenses to make scenes look bigger and more interesting, while maintaining a low FOV shot composition.
---
Enjoy.

Thanks for posting, I had a solid laugh, lol. That laughing guy fits perfectly
