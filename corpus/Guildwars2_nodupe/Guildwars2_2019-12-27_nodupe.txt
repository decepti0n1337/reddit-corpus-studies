I wasn't there to experience season 1, but given my experience with the rest of ANets writing, that description sounds... *generous*.
---
---
---
People need to realize though that this game isnt made to be played for more than a few hours a week, that is the exact target audience Anet is aiming this game at, because by only playing a few hours a week, the releases they call content will take a month or more to do, its also backed up by Anet pretty much putting everything in the gem store now, seriously stop asking for anything in game, as it all goes via the gem store now, because someone who plays only a few hours a week is more likely to hit that gem store up to get said items.
---

---
The total lack of communication over the years has sealed Anets fate, they put out an apparent road map for next year, but only after a 3rd party site pretty much called them out for lack of communication, Anet are always reactive and not proactive, if they arent pushed over and over and over they would never put any info out, we are still waiting for that Alliance update that was supposed to come a few months after the August announcement, 
---
I see people saying, yaya content updates every month, you got to ask yourself, what you call content and what anet call content, as that gemstore will be getting plenty of content updates.
---
This game will not get better, it will get slowly worse month on month, and eventually more and more will bail out, and follow the advice of the white knights to just get a new game, etc as this game isnt for them, Anet will not change, they will continue the process of ignoring the community that they rely on to actually play the game they create.
---
For those who continue to support anet, i hope the game does turn around for you, i played Guild Wars from Beta, and Guild Wars 2 from beta, so a total of 14+ years now, but the lack of respect Anet has for us, has made me abandon them now, everyone will have a breaking point, and sooner or later you will hit yours in regards this game.
---
I almost coughed out my spleen too.
---
If you think that was a masterwork..... I have this Rembrandt to sell you. It was in my granny's attic I swear!
---
In regards to the Divinity, I think you are absolutely spot on.  I dunno, it just felt terrible, and I'd actually kinda be surprised if anyone used that thing.  Again, that's totally subjective and I get that.  I just used that as an example of how their investment in the gemstore DID in fact impact the actual game.  And you are correct on Crystin Cox.  She was hired on before GW2 launched, though supposedly 'in a different role' than monetization (I don't know if that's legit or not but I seem to recall it being mentioned).  I will say, however, that I do not think it was merely her presence, and I fully believe the higher ups at Anet bought into the idea fully.
---
I'm more disappointed that you forgot to mention that it's also a christmas gift to Eredon Terrace, and it's additionally from Devona's Rest and Isle of Janthir. :(
---
Mastery time gate, took more time to do than the story itself. Wow! This saga is truly amazing.
---
I advise against it. Those drives are not designed for constant transfers but for data storage.
---
You are better off finding other things to transfer onto it like videos, photos etc.
---
I m pretty sure even mac OSs and browsers have a cleanup function that gets rid of old temporary files. Try finding those.
---
NCSoft is on record that they want to invest more into the mobile market.  Anet is owned by NCSoft.  NCSoft canned two additional products when the layoffs occurred.  I will let you deduce what at least one of those products was.
---
ynow these days there are games with even 150gb right?

Korag

And half the arms is twice the work
---
As a writer that's exciting! I wish I could join and will definitely apply!
---
I did move on.  As stated in my post, I moved on this summer and haven't touched the game since then.  I was only made aware of this post via a group I'm still in elsewhere on Social Media.  Feel free to check my post history if you'd like.  I'm not on here every day bashing GW2.  Also, just for the record, my requirements didn't change, ANet's philosophy did.  When I started playing GW1, I enjoyed the challenge and the ability to dive deeper into the game.  GW2 started that way and then drifted over the years.  I then moved on to Savage Raiding in FFXIV.  So no, my requirements aren't 'different'.
---
How do you fix the icing problem?
---
You're inflicting that perspective on yourself though. I'm not saying it's not a real problem to overcome psychologically, because it is. But you just can't think of it like that.
---
Do you worry about your gym membership every hour you're not at the gym?
---
If you go a week without Netflix, do you freak out?
---
If you don't use your two day shipping from Amazon because you didn't buy anything, does it stress you?
---
Same idea with a game subscription. And my point is, you don't waste money. In the year you spent $400 on gw2, you paid roughly what, $35 a month for that? Were you stressing out then?
---
It's all perspective.
---
They had amazing ambition.  But I genuinely feel HoT was the turning point with how it was received.  Also, for clarity, I never personally streamed, but was deeply involved with some large stream communities.  Don't want to come off like I'm trying to be something I'm not.
---
Co-op is essentially what raids and dungeons are, so it's a start.
---
I wouldn't even resent their open world focus if it had been more like HoT's amazing meta maps from the core xpac, but the fact is these living world and the whole of PoF in general has been empty garbage to match the empty rewards.
---
3+ years out and I still can enjoy Dragon's Stand or Chak Gerent or Tarir, whereas the "metas" for PoF have been forgettable dumpster fire that's basically HP sponges with little cohesive map coordination or encounter nuance.
---
Yeah, it's doing really well right now.  It's a great sign for the health of your company when multiple senior level staff leave within months of one another.
---
[Scroll down to see if people buy them \(yes\)](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/item/9586-18-Slot-Mithril-Box)
---
The profit is 1s, and 10s for the Orichalcum box. Even flipping them gives more profit.
---
Agreed. Though I haven't run into any problems that really irk me yet. So far it's only minor QoL things, the fact that leveling from 1 to 50 is a slog, and the fact that 2.1 to 2.4 makes you want to die if you have to do one more damn fetch quest. 
---
That last one was the only really bad one. And I'm just complaining that a small, small, small amount of the content is really boring. 
---
I don't PVP though. And I know their PVP is bad. But, most MMO's (unless it's a PVP centric MMO like Blade and Soul) have bad PVP. MMO's are typically PVE centric. At least in my opinion and experience. 
---
As you said though. It's so polished. And when a mistake is made (like the recent Ishgard restoration world hop stuff) it's fixed pleasantly fast.
---
How big is your hard drive?
---
50gb is pretty small for an mmo.
---
Because at least Bethesda has the good sense to let their players mod the living hell out of the games they half ass. The amount of play time I derived from mods in Skyrim dwarfs any MMO I've ever played. Hell, the base game of skyrim may be a short story and butt ugly broomstick hair graphics, but the sense of ambiance and immersion with the mage's guild, the dark brotherhood, thieves' guild, etc and the daedric prince quests are gold. Add in a vibrant modding community, and a mediocre game is turned into a golden sandbox.
---
GW2 does not give three flying fucks about their players. The developers make the game as they see fit and don't even have public test realms or change proposed patch notes based on player feedback. The modding of the game is immensely restricted and cumbersome. I have to use a fucking overlay for taco where in WoW I wouldn't have to deal with that bullshit, let alone installing DPS meters in WoW or modifying the UI or class resources and CD tracking.
---
My power revenant and reaper have been sitting in the PvE dumpster for two expnasions straight while they only concentrate on pvp specific patches with no dedicated patches and split balancing for raid and dungeon balance.
---
The only thing you can't solo in GW2 is raids, and what would be the point anyways given the abysmal rewards compared to GW1's reward scheme.
---
Soloing DoA with heroway was hard, even with paragon cheese. Foundry was particularly brutal.
---
Gear treadmill my ass. Show me your challenge mod records and transmog on WoW, or your world first races on content you were undergeared for.
---
The difference here is GW2 doesn't let you use weak auras or most tracking add ons for that matter. You have to mentally count your autoattacks and hope you don't clip your auto chain in bwteen skill use, as that's a DPS loss. You have to mentally keep track of the cooldowns of your swapped out weapons.  Your ability to see through the vomit of VFX on mostly human sized bosses.
---
It takes a particular person with a particular memory to play condi renegade well, or condi engineer, or power chronomancer.
---
This gizmo become slightly more afordable, thanks to Asgeir amulets.
---
he still plays actually but dunno more than that about him
---
for solo the dps chrono illusions version is great! just take delayed reactions and loads of crit, aim for 65% base crit chance(so eagle runes and assassin armor)
---
DO NOT take wells(except calamity/grav maybe) and shield is trash af
---
i'd run timewarp for slow and try to burst stuff down, it's pretty effective..obviously take feedback when reflects are needed but i wouldn't go inspi unless you wanna afk slowly kill stuff
---
you can also go the improved alacrity route but again, it's more of a crutch unless you want to solo strike missions or other very long fights
---
lol right, spoken like someone who doesn't clear mythics.
---
Someone mentioned it in mapchat today and I just had to try it.
---
Oh hey, [you actually edited a whole other part of a comment instead of leaving it on gem store capes. :\^)](https://imgur.com/mldiXS5)  
---
But you're still a dumb fuck because i literally said that you can't disprove points by saying that the other game does it too/better/worse, because otherwise i could just compare GW2 to Fallout 76 and it will be the game of the decade.  
---
&gt; The whole point of Eureka was for glamour...its almost like you don't even play the game.... 
---
The whole point of Eureka was for an open world FFXI-esque grinding and a new alternative of getting decent equpment, if you didn't know you could get up to a 385 ilevel weapons there.  
---
 
---
&gt;GW2 is 99% instanced its almost like you don't even play GW2. 
---
Well, even WoW is instanced, technically, but you now just trying to exaggerate instead of actually disproving me. 
---
&gt; As oppose to GW2 design of avoiding bad circles and beams o wait O.O, its almost like you don't even play both games. 
---
Again, not a disprove of my opinion about FFXIV
---
&gt; As oppose to GW2 story of absorbing dragon magic and becoming friends with our cute little dragon and dealing the finishing blow to the evil dragon heart with our magical dragon friend o wait O.O its almost like you didn't even play GW2.... 
---
You're helpless, are you?
---
There was some weird chick flick or somwthing woth a Rytlock doll. They just have a small "nerd things" prop area or something at the studio
---
The point is that you have already shown your cards by submitting a false version of events that omitted the actual deeds.   
---
   
---
But by all means, keep pretending, you're not fooling anyone.
---
Don't you dare touch my dearly departed Wildstar's unrivaled housing system. God, I miss that game and still hope those executive producers and managers who sunk the game many devs worked hard on only to get promotions at Blizzard when they jumped ship eventually get chlamydia.
---
That's not why ESO is a turn off to me. By far the best leveling and immersive experience of any MMO I've played, with wonderful quests.
---
The turn off is the animation cancel garbage turning my character into an epileptic and the really ugly character and armor models; the graphics of that game are really subpar.
---
sure
---
don't see why you'd care what people do in videogames as long as it doesn't impact you directly either
---
Love the dynamism of the piece &lt;3
---
And if you don't have any back to ascend, get the +5 infusion for 25 relics, and trade it for 5 bags of 15. You spend 25 to get 75, and thus make 50.
---
does that person still take commissions? cause that’s so adorable and i’d love to get one of my main character as well💖
---
Look at the top of the screen, you can see the timer of the instance. It's aprox 10 seconds cutted of idle time.
---
I'm hoping Drakkar's gonna' be a really cool map-wide grand scale meta event boss in the style of Heart of Thorns metas with great replayability.
---
Anet have made some very awesome things in the past and honestly I remain pretty optimistic. I know it's not popular and apparently as a redditor I'm supposed to be an old grouch who hates fun and nothing's ever good enough, but I still enjoy this game and I think we'll do alright yet.
---
Because we're forced to cast out those retarded pubbie approaches to krabbing once players like this join actual alliances.
---
There are reasons for advocating cheap warpspeed Carriers over blinged Battleships.
---
I kinda like this except for the idea of incorporating it into contacts and lfg. I'd rather have it be its own thing.
---
 But he himself was the sole income source for the game, a bright light of life and a savior.
---
/s
---
Yup. Same as the previous years. Shitty unpolished, non-replayable, non-rewarding "content", 2 modes dead, devs that cant balance, regular gemstore updates. Sounds right.
---
As a returning player OP pretty much nailed it with my impressions of this sub from reading it again for the past month.
---
I find this comic to be a bad example, I haven’t seen anyone bashing new players or friends who invite new players.
---
See I found HoT launch to be one of the many nails in the coffin.  Remember the Colin hype train?  I feel like this isn't talked about much anymore, but we had been promised so much and almost none of it was delivered at launch.  Not even raids which were a huge part of HoT were there at the xpaxs launch.  Here is a meme from the time: https://youtu.be/01-_jGAu_Vw
---
The average player can already easily get enough of these that it at least helps a bit. So.. why not ask for both a new tome and a way to get all tomes passes and such into a handy new place?
---
All Mastery Points are tied to achievements.  They'll be marked with Mastery Point symbols in your achievement list, colour-coded based on whether they're Core Tyria, Heart of Thorns, Path of Fire or Icebrood Saga Mastery Points.
---
Since I have no way of knowing what achievements you've already done, I can't give more specific advice than that.  You'll have to go through the achievement list, find the achievements you haven't done that have the Mastery Point symbols you need, then go and do those achievements.  Some will be easier than others, of course.  In Heart of Thorns, Adventures always give Mastery Points, as do the hidden Strongboxes, so those can be good starts.  Path of Fire has an extra Mastery Point for each mount by running around and doing various tasks as detailed in the achievements.
---
OwO, home instance again when?
---
- "We kept either seeing the same people applying for the job who weren't necessarily aligning with what we needed, but also we were seeing a lack of diverse candidates," he said. "We're a global game. We're in markets all over the world, and if we don't broaden our hiring outreach, what's going to happen is we're just going to keep telling the same stories over and over again.
---
Uh.... what?
---
You can find out every mastery point by going through the achievement panel.
---
That said, mastery insights are generally the easiest to get, they're just a point of interest to channel at.
---
But you can blow $400 on an online game because you like it?
---
I don't think I need to research monthly income to understand your situation.
---
i did know a good chunk of them are either on the map or related to completing story chapters, but the acheivements thing as a whole is new. thanks! i was wondering.
---
If there is one thing that is not slow in this game then it is the leveling process. You can get to lvl 80 in 24 hours or a few days, a week or months all depending on how much you play.
---
Every level from lvl 15 and above have the same percentage of xp needed so there will never be any longer times for higher levels. Other games have that.
---
Gear progress is very simple and easy and you can never pick the wrong path or choose the wrong traits or skills. You will have it all at the end. 
---
You don't have to back track quests in which you have to do in other games which makes it 10 times longer to level in those games. 
---
It is easy to get xp and there are no kill steal or the like.
---
Things to do whilst leveling to get xp is a shit ton of things. For example. hearts, events, map events, meta events, boss events, worldboss events, story dungeon, crafting, gathering, mini adventures (sanctum sprint and more), race (f2p can hire mounts cheap), special events (such as bandit leaders, invasions and so on, festivals, 
---
Will the first time take longer? Ofc it will. If you have no knowledge of the game at all you need to learn everything.But even so it does not take as long as it takes in other games. PvP and WvW is what comes on top of my head. 
---
What GW2 is bad at explaning is builds and traits and stats whilst leveling up. Also breakbars. This is something that could improve and make faster understanding, especially if people are interested in starting with PvP or WvW fast, since the game is skillbased and you will get your nuts handled to you if you know nothing.
---
Now to take it to the next step, if there's an achievement you're not sure how to complete that gives a mastery point, type /wiki achievementname into your chat bar to open that page on the Guild Wars 2 Wiki, which should have more information about getting it done.  If there are some steps in, say, Springer Backpacking or Reins of the Raptor that you're unsure of, typing /wiki Springer Backpacking or /wiki Reins of the Raptor will get you the answers you need!
---
&gt;  open that page on the Guild Wars 2 Wiki, which should have more information about getting it done. If there are some steps in, say, Springer Backpacking or Reins of the Raptor that you're unsure of, typing /wiki Springer Backpacking or /wiki Reins of the Raptor will get you the answers you need!
---
oh SICK i did NOT know about the /wiki thing! thanks!!
---
&gt; But you can blow $400 on an online game because you like it?
---
Yes. I repeat, it was over two years. And it's yourself who started cherrypicking arguments. Let's wrap it up here.
---
Preaching to the choir.
---
Personally I'd argue we have been getting expansion like content. And do so every LW Season.
---
Alas, none from me, but I believe a helpful individual posted a link to one above.
---
If they spent half the amount of time developing the game instead of talking about development, marketing useless shit (quiznos), and partnering with every fucking store possible to push merch... they would be doing better as a game company.
---
But what do I know.
---
Have they taken advantage of our goodwill? I don't feel they have and I've been pretty consistently happy with the content they've pushed out, to be quite honest I'm just amazed and happy to still give even the slightest shit about an MMO seven years in - even World of Warcraft could barley hold my attention prior to having a proper guild and a newbie raid team, once that went away my interest for the game did too, just wasn't anything there I gave a shit about anymore, for people to say it's a GW2 problem or ANet problem is short-sighted and plain not true - I think they just wish they were more invested than they can be at this point, peoples interest in games wanes over time, it's natural with something you spend so much time with and without the human element that will always be fresh it's easy to fall away from stuff but that's totally okay.
---
I think some people need to learn to let go when it comes time to, rather than clinging to something that wont change the way they want it to or give them something it can't give them anymore.
---
Please point out *one* place which has icebrood but not Svanir or Svanir-converted individuals and has the totems.
---
P.S., all grawl and jotun but the Frostgorge's Dragon Tribe grawl were converted by Sons of Svanir.
---
The only bags I usually buy are the 18 slot bags from the wvw vendor.

\- Jumping Mushrooms/Thermal Propulsion/Oakheart's Reach
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm probably missing out more features that were abandoned and with a track record like this, how is any player who's been in this game for a number of years supposed to have ANY confidence any new feature announced will not be abandoned as soon as there's any significant negative feedback?
---
It's like they don't have the resources to tweak what the community doesn't like about the features to make them better. Take Hearts NPCs for example. They were one and done content so they were tweaked to become daily repeatables. Good concept, but the execution was flawed because it's such a chore to unlock the NPCs everyday to buy stuff. Instead of tweaking it to be less of a chore and more rewarding, they'd rather abandon it.
---
The game has 3 major game modes, it attracts too diverse a community to properly cater to everyone's tastes. We get that. It's fine to get things wrong the first time round. I think we'd actually appreciate fine-tuning features as the game gets older. But if they keep churning and chucking features, they're trading on the long-term goodwill of their most invested players and I just feel this will eventually bite them in retention figures.
---
They rented a stage. 
---
The saga's not over yet, but hoo boy episode 1 (after the fiasco of build templates) sure didn't start anyone off on the right foot.
---
Like others have said, leveling is extremely easy in this game. Between map exploration and dynamic events you level fairly fast. 
---
Keep in mind though, the game is not for everyone. I tried to get a couple friends into the game, they hung out for a few days, but quickly lost interest.
---
&gt;You're talking in absolutes and nothing is absolute.
---
I mean, he could be a Sith.
---
Even if you arent asuran, this act of true experimentation certifies you as one. Well done, sir.
---
Thank you. I would've never figured that out. Not very intuitive at all IMO.
---
&gt; the BLTC section in the patch notes is usually 1/3 of the whole thing
---
This is (IMO) one of the main problems...
---
They really should get more content (maybe not more but some that get closer to the expectations of the community) done instead of focusing on stuff that the ppl don't want to see. Patch notes are also like a short announcement about what to expect. If you always put "we like to take your money" on 1/3 of those then ppl will think twice about staying with the game. You want to show the community "Hey, here we go with a bunch of awesome new stuff that you can enjoy for the next X month".
---
I know that they also want/need to make money but they should really think about what the main factor for them is and in this case, it should be the game and its content. Make and keep the community love your game then they might/will also be willed to pay for the game they love (at least I would never pay for a game that I don't really like and might drop in a few days/weeks).
---
Main things that are not like other games ...
---
... killing things above your level does NOT give you any bonus
---
... leveling as a level 70 in a level 10 map is still very good exp
---
... cheap food/util exp boost +25xp (as mentioned)
---
... use guild hall buffs, if you own expac
---
... killing stale mobs to get a fat bonus
---
Feel free to enlighten. I was here for the entire thing and sincerely doubt that there was something that I missed. I couldn't care less about "SJW wamann", I saw an individual who linked their twitter account with their job, proceeded to shit on someone who was offering constructive criticism on a very, very public platform, and then proceeded to lose their collective cool over some non-existent sleight to their gender. Then, upon further inspection, it turns out that this individual has made a lifetime of doing that exact thing on Twitter, and all around being an incredibly intollerant and not-so-great human being, all while "crusading" under the guise of pushing gender equality. Peter getting fired from *what we saw* in the public domain was unwarranted, in my mind, but who knows what his track record looked like internally, or what he said to his superiors about the incident. Don't try to pretend she was doing some righteous thing when all she was after was attention and self aggrandizement via a public platform where she thought she'd get a bunch of other people to chime in and tell a man to fuck off.
---
It was that or add a strobe light to the store front.
---
They did clearly say how to deposit food in the patch notes.
---
Yeah, it's not very intuitive, but I bet it was the easiest way to implement that without requiring UI changes (which is a big no-no for some reason).
---
God ur dumb
---
You mean like EVERYTIME you press 'O'  ?
---
Okay.
---
I'm going to sound dumb as fuck but I have no idea how to read this.
---
Its much better for them to cave in to the viewpoints of far-right trolls spouting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories
---
Except that no one, ever, literally, has said the fourth panel stuff.
---
And here I thought I was the only person who thought the show was bad!
---
It'll be back pieces that are worth salvaging soon (if not already)
---
You know what?  I actually want to see the Visions of the Past story and how it plays out.  Should it be the only thing they release?  Of course not... I want everyone to get content that they enjoy... but can we please fucking STOP telling them to NOT make content just because it's not your thing?  They don't have to be mutually exclusive... grow the fuck up.
---
Subreddit gets multiple toxic memes. Comic maker makes comic about toxicity. Toxic people call out. Other comic maker makes comic about toxicity and response to toxicity.
---
That's the beauty of subscription right there. It's a fixed and rather stable income so the devs can actually focus on gameplay and not the store. The rewards go in the game and not the damn store. Even better, you as a customer have way more power in your hands as you have a right for good and frequent content and no1 can tell you to "be grateful for what little you get since it's free".  Basically it puts everything in perspective. Yes you might end up paying more in some cases or feel that you need to log in so you can make the most of that subscription but at least you know where you stand.
---
For me though the biggest problem with GW2 isnt the gem store fiasco. That is actually a symptom of the deeper problem. As a lot of people might know NCSoft have the studio bought, they own all copyrights to the game and have full control over what policies they wanna promote. Basically even though this is a guess NCSoft dont give a rat's ass about this game anymore, the income is tiny compared to what lineage and most of their other MMOs make. All the millions that got transfered to the NCSoft west department a few months ago, every penny went into the new lineage game, everything.  Anet are simply pushed into hitting financial quotas here, if they dont reach them the studio will probably disband and NCSoft  sell the game to another studio along with the copyrights and everything. Or just simply pull the plug if the profits dont even cover server costs.
---
You'd love official forums then, mods have tools there and it represents the game's current state perfectly.
---
I can't believe people really want comments to be taken out, if there is so much toxicity I would look it up why. I would never say your comment should taken out because I don't like your opinions.
---
Even the most toxic comment is more valuable for me than " pLeAsE rAtE mY mEsMeR" posts. If you want only these "rating" posts or some stupid newbie question which they can find the answer in wiki page or quick Google search, then there you go it is that sub without criticism.
---
Honestly do you feel this is actually sustainable? Living story was the intermediate between expansions and provided us with not just maps and story but also gave us some raids and fractals in between. It was very successful as FILLER content between the 2 big expac releases. But as standalone content with nothing else its not enough to sustain a healthy playerbase. I mean i played without rushing and it took me 2 days to finish the new story and all the achievements. 2 days. Then i logged off and havent touched it since then.There's just no point for me.
---
Only way would be to massively recycle the playerbase but you would actually need huge marketing investment to achieve that. It's definitely not in maintenance mode but they are just releasing the bare minimum and hope it brings back enough people to bump their gem store sales. Feels like they already gave up on the game ever making a big comeback or competing with other games of the genre.
---
Wooooow. I hope you took a nice relaxing stroll after that one. Fine, you want the game to alert you. Good for you. That doesn't mean everybody else has to be. It's not a competition.
---
&gt;But even someone annoyed by this might be tempted to buy something if they click on it to make it go away.
---
And that isn't necessarily a good thing. So I'm kind of surprised you're implying it is. Because while ArenaNet making money isn't bad, badgering and annoying players might eventually drive more players away.
---
This one is Left to Right, Top to Bottom
---
At this point i can imagine them trying to build GW3 on the same game engine xD.
---
Hodor
---
it's cancelled, gw2 will close
---
There's probably multiple reasons. Spaghetti code, not enough people working on it, not a clear idea of how to do it right, etc.

They did say it was going to be months before they gave even just details on what they are planning. It was clear from the Icebrood announcement that it's still far off from happening. The PvP side of the game doesn't have many resources. Anet has all it's resources in living world, basically. We'd be lucky if even a handful of people are working on alliances. Whoever is working it, needs to make a system that doesn't suck and destroy WvW balance, doesn't flat out break WvW, and doesn't break the rest of the game.
---
It's always possible that it never comes out. It's a big change for a game mode the bulk of the playerbase doesn't care about. It might end up being too much work for the resources available. The game could die before it's finished. I think it's going to happen, but I think it's still far away from being finished.
---
It's on a table somewhere

&gt; Even the most toxic comment is more valuable for me than " pLeAsE rAtE mY mEsMeR" posts.

Toxic posts are detractions, not additional value. We don't benefit from toxic posts, they kill moral, they are not constructive, they alienate developers, they undermine genuine concerns and they push away the kinds of people who make the sub a nice place to visit and share a common interest.

---
Leave him, judging by everything he posts everywhere, he's just a troll. Seriously, every "controversial" thread made this guy enters and posts something to trigger circlejerking.
---
Like any show that goes on for more than a handful of seasons, it became grating and repetitive to the point where it's no longer entertaining.
---
Sooo what's false about it?
---
First off, the question asked what "why have this feature in the first place?"
---
The answer to that was, "it was requested by members of the community."
---
Even though that is the case...even with requested features...this community has to bitch at arenanet.  Literally everything ArenaNet does gets complained about on here.  For fucks sake, some people even threw a fit over the mounts because one of the mounts was a secret that was behind a 250g paywall.  There were literally people on here saying "fuck anet, fuck this game.  I'm not paying 250g for a mount."
---
In general...the forum presence of this game's population is fucking vile.  They will announce/release something that may have been long requested...and what gets upvoted/bumped to the top?  The griefers, the complaints, the "fuck you anet".  This community is the epitome of "having your cake and eating it too".  I'm convinced at this point, they could announce a release of literally everything the community wants and you fuckers would still find a way to say "fuck you anet".
---
I browse the forums of a lot of different games...and GW2 is by far the worst.  Either through moderation or pure community votes...GW2 posters are easily the more critical and negative about a game they claim to love so much.
---
Yes, there are things about the game and game developer that I don't particularly care for...but holy fuck do you guys go to a whole new level.  One really extreme example...back when PoF released someone made a post on here that made it to the front page.  That post simply said, "A new expansion is cool, but I hate the desert so I'll just skip this and wait for the next one."  They went on to explain how they hated jungles so they barely played HoT, and they hate deserts so they were just going to skip PoF entirely.  That was for the Path of Fire announcement.  Not the beta, not the release...just the announcement.  That poster was praised in the comments and joined by a bunch of others about how the desert is "so boring".  
---
This community is straight up toxic.  You will latch onto one thing and that is your argument of the day about why Anet is a trash company.  Gee...I wonder why they only care about the minor things the community wants?  I would kill for a day I can browse this subreddit and see praise for the new patch with some minor criticism...but no, every patch this community will yell and scream about how trash anet is regardless of what good comes of the patch.
---
The worst part is...there are people who post positive things about the company and the patches.  Guess what happens to those posts?  They get downvoted into oblivion.  This fucking echo chamber has decided that Anet is the worst company next to EA and you will not let a dissenting opinion through.  Yes, I can argue about this community both ways because I understand that "the community" is a broad over-generalizing term that encompasses the good and bad.  I can use it in a context to speak to the good or I can use to to speak to the bad...but the fucking context matters.  Learn to understand context before trying to tell me I can't argue about a very broad over-generalizing term.
---
How do you know this?

---
Is this r/Warframe?
---
No, *they* should be ignored, but regardless of what position *they* happen to fall on, right is right, and Jessica Price was in the wrong in that case.
---
I don't feel like they're that excited about working on something that isn't going tor revitalize or save wvw at all.
---
that is very true, my game locks when exiting too!
---
It's not a bad sign either, it's just something that happens with large studios producing "eternal games." Various devs tend to burn out from doing the same projects continuously and want to work on other things. If they can't work on them internally within that company, because the companies resources are too tied up in making that one game the best it can be, then it's best for *everyone* for that developer to move on to someplace he can stretch his legs. 
---
This time a couple years back, GW2 was being developed, and also supposedly 1-2 other projects were being developed, with X number of developers working on those projects. When NCSoft swooped in and made some cuts, by all accounts those cuts weren't to the GW2 side of things, they were to those other projects, and that tends to happen in game studios all the time. So some of the developers that had been working on those other projects were cut completely, and others were shifted back over to GW2, so apparently GW2's staff is *higher* today than it was before the cuts. That's not an indication of a game in freefall.
---
Donate your gold and uninstall. Best way to use your time.
---
Depends on what you're looking for. There are plenty of people playing the game who are enjoying it. There are plenty of people who aren't enjoying it.
---
If you're looking for Guild Wars 1.5, though, this is absolutely not it. 
---
I have people in my guild who expected that, left for a long time, came back and now they're enjoying the game. Depends on your ability to think of this as a new and different game, because it really has very little in common with Guild Wars 1.
---
Thank you Nostradamus.

There's been quite a bit added since launch (summary: mounts, 10+ new maps, elite class specializations, new legendary weapons &amp; armour, sprawling storyline, etc.), but it all depends on how high you set your standards. I've only played GW2 and I absolutely love it, but I hear the OG GW1 players still shitting on this game all the time, so my guess would be that you will probably continue to not like this game despite my endorsement. Also, it's starting to go downhill since the original develpment team left (more focus being placed on the gem store ew), so it's future isn't looking too promising.
---
Hmm, wvw is not competitive mode tho.. it's not like it has match making system or ranked games in PvP.
---
Maybe it's more common than I know, because personally I don't follow a lot of games.  But I think you'd be kidding yourself if you think GW2 is in a good spot at the moment.
---
How so?
---
1 year without fractal (353 days), 6 months without raid (204 days). 3 raids and 3 fractals in 2 years. The only consistent thing about this release cadence is the extreme scarcity.
---
&gt;But its okay because we got 2 free equipment templates that deliberately don't match in their numbers with the 3 free build templates we got.
---
Well PvP had and has its own gear system. So technically you got 2 equipment templates for PvE and WvW (PvP has it's own rune/amulet system) and 3 build templates for PvE, WvW and PvP. It kind of made sense, but it was and still is a total rip-off considering the prices and how limited it is.
---
&gt; working on swiss
---
At the risk of sounding like a complete idiot, what is swiss? Every time I see someone mention it, I think of the cheese. 
---
I haven’t played the game in a looong time, but was recently thinking about popping back in. I thought the sub would be a good place to start getting caught up.
---
haha funny gamergate joke
---
Fair enough, but it is still awfully convenient for them to fall back on the fact that PvP doesn't need gear.
---
Also, we have the triple monetization in build templates which is far more egregious. In hindsight I should have mentioned that instead of the inconsistencies in base number of templates.
---
Wow, you have no idea who I am so I'm not sure why you're attacking me personally. The comment I replied to stated that this was the least invasive way of adding a feature like this. I just gave my take on it. Walk it off big man
---
I'm not on the "game dying bad" yet. But I swear if we get through the saga without elite specs I'm done. I already won't spend any more money after how aggressively monetized build templates were. And after how lackluster and vanilla episode 1 was? They could slash that sales price by a whole decimal and I wouldn't buy it. Tired of ANet's strategy of wanting faith on credit for literally ever. "We promise we'll finish the second set of legendaries." Only took two expansions to follow up on that with releasing several skins in the gem store that could've vied for the status.
---
Somehow build templates was just the worst of them all though, with the only thing that seems to be the focus of such aggressive monetization and underdelivery of overselling (living story) opening on a huge sour note.
---
There were once plans for "fractal leaderboards". ANET insisted for months and months that they were working on them and that they were coming. In the end, they scrapped them. No one can say whether or not the same will happen to alliances. In theory it could though. There is a precedent for it. In practice... well I should think people would not want that to happen. Whilewith fractal leaderboards, I'm not sure anyone actually wanted them.

You forgot gemstore skins set. Im actually hoping for a lot of new skins that are made from the outfit skins.

A good Feedback placed right when they start Rapid-Fire Shot makes for some tasty satisfaction.
---
And thieves infinite stealth too.
---
Both need solo nerfs and group improvements ASAP. Nobody wants rangers or thieves on squad.
---
&gt;Honestly do you feel this is actually sustainable?
---
Maybe. The expansions made huge spikes on the revenue graph but they quickly went down. On the other hand, the LS doesn't cause big spikes, but it comes more often. We also can't know if the gemstore sales are higher when following an expac or a LS season.
---
&gt;But as standalone content with nothing else its not enough to sustain a healthy playerbase.
---
Both Anet and the community will tell you : just take a break, you can play gw2 along with other game, and other bullshit. It turns out you can have a playerbase that spends money on your cashstore without necessarily having a stable playerbase. It doesn't matter if you have player turnover, as long as they spend.
---
Being frustrated with GW2, I went to try out Destiny 2. It's definitely a cash shop with a game on the side, but it doesn't mean the gameplay is bad. It made me realize that GW2 is a worse offender : sure, there aren't shaders (equivalent to dyes) in the cashstore, but at least there are sparrows (mounts) available as in-game rewards.
---
Inb4 inevitable debate about whether D2 is an MMO or not.
---
Curious as to the reasoning for the classification of Mirror Masked, why miscellaneous over significant model changes?
---
&gt; played GW2 at launch and wasn't impressed. Should I get back into the game?
---
I think you would need to be a bit more specific with the first part to make the second part easier to answer.
---
If you weren't impressed by GW2 in terms of "it just isn't gw1" then I don't think you will like it today either. If it was because if "there wasn't much to do at launch" then there got a lot more added to GW2 since launch. You do have to spend some money on it though.
---
Despite what others said the game is perfect to play, there was a lot of stuff added over the years that will keep you playing for thousands of hours and you still would have a lot of stuff to do. If you rush everything or just focus on parts of the game you will run out of things faster.
---
For example, I have spent over 5000 hours in this game and have 35K Achievement points, I have done a lot of things I wanted to do and what I'm doing right now is just slowly work towards things that I think are fun and I have time for.
---
And despite what others have said of it "going" downhill, I don't agree with that. It just doesn't cater to their playstyle anymore. There are issues with the game and it caters more to the casual approach of playing it but it will take a long time for any new player to reach that point, maybe years even.
---
So, since you already have the game why not just play it?!
---
The table is on the table.
---
Because it’s more than just a model change. It has a model change + unique particle effects.
---
You don't need auto hot key, Guild Wars 2 has the option to just set alternative keybinds for everything.  I have funky keybinds for skills and just top row numbers for playing music.  No need for any outside macros or switching or programs or anything.  It's right there in the options menu.
---
Ah I see what you mean. Indeed, also unique sound effects
---
&gt; Just imagine, for example, where we could have been if they never would have invested years of resources for the Chinese client, which still struggles to even make profit.
---
I do not blame them for attempting to go over in that market. China's video games market is INSANE level of revenues.

&gt; In other mmos you have to continuosly farm for gear, and more often than not your gear matters more than your skill because numbers
---
This is just a big lie, at least for FFXIV. There you can't even do certain kinds of content if you gear isn't good enough (so you can't complain you only failed because of gear). And the way the game is structured it doesn't take long to get the required gear. So if GW2 had a "gear treadmill" you would be required to have "exotic" gear for raids. And we all know that you are technically "overgeared" when in full ascended + buff food.
---
GW2 has several problems and a missing gear treadmill is certainly NOT one of them. First of all the gear and build of a new player will 99% be shit unless they look up a guide (or someone tells them what to pick). Giving players a lot of options wouldn't be as bad if there weren't so many useless builds and "traps".
---
After that there is the huge difference of difficulty between the open world/story and the more difficult content. There is really nothing to bridge these things. In other MMOs dungeons are required or at least heavily incentived and offer a good "introduction" into harder dungeons and raiding.
---
The last problem would probably be the "meta" and the roles or rather the lack of (official and balanced) roles. Having good synergy in GW2 is really important and if you don't cover the most important boons the fights will be much more difficult. I mean sure you will probably do more damage if you combo your DH spear, symbol, traps and gs #2 compared to someone who just presses 1 but that damage will still be shit if you don't have all the important boons. And unless you are an expert of every profession and can tell random players in your group with random professions what build to use to optimize boon uptime and dps you will most likely just follow the meta. And that meta is kind of restrictive and more complicated compared to the "metas" of other MMOs which usually only consist of Tanks, Healers and DPS.
---
In the end all these things result in a super low participation rate, which results in less new content which results in even less players for that kind of content which then repeats the cycle.
---
I check the sub maybe every other day or every couple days, and truthfully, my time feels better spent elsewhere.  I'm not going to look down on people for continuing to play GW1 or GW2, but I feel more valued in Path of Exile.  That makes it much easier for me to pick up some micro-transactions/stash tabs.  
---
I don't really feel like ArenaNet has a plan for the long-term future of the game.  I can't continue to play the game when PoE has ~ 19 elite specializations equivalents? They're not hard-limited by archtype or playstyle either and that allows for incredible build variety that mirrors dual-classes in GW1.  It's awesome! 
---
I still raid with friends on discord on weekends occasionally, but there's no competition when GGG has a new challenge league out.  I've put an absurd number of hours into PoE: Metamorph since 12/13 and I have no regrets.  ArenaNet hasn't really hit their stride with the Icebrood Saga and I'm not willing to wait for them to figure out what LS5 means to them so they can tell us.
---
It feels like it's been months since ArenaNet unveiled the Icebrood Saga and we still .. just like .. what *is* the Icebrood Saga? LS5? More? Less? Maybe? The announcement did not live up to expectations, and while I have little doubt that there are people .. around .. being sarcastic, pessimistic and angsty if you don't like the game .. just unironically, and ironically, leave.
---
I mean, aight, sounds cool to me. Glad they've got a future in the works beyond GW2.
---
Sigh, here we go again
---
No
---
Players: ANet, it'd be cool to have feature X.  
---
ANet: sure, we'll put it on...  
---
Players: ***NOOOOOO!!!***

---
  
---
*Feature vanishes, along with a new, enthusiastic dev who wanted to take care of it later*
---
F
---
Not a surprise, but kinda sad that even Anet is clearly moving away from MMOs. There is really no hope for this game or this genre in general. There are a few established MMOs and obviously New World coming up, but the combat does not interest me. GW2 is not going to die anytime soon, but it's gonna be a slow and ugly death.
---
Pretty sure he took it out of his ass.
---
Gw2 changed its focus from wvw, pvp and hard endgame pve to casual friendly and braindead pve content. Change my mind.
---
Oh brother
---
nah I just press signet of hunt
---
and then your reflect runs out and you die to 4k aa or run because you're glass

aka how mesmer encounters usually play out
---
Dont forget the hype they created about the new SAGA....
---
Make a different type of Guild Wars game (but not a trading card game or a mobile one). I'd be on board for sure, particularly if it retold Guild Wars 1 in the light of the GW2 lore the way Warcraft 3 Reforged is supposedly doing.
---
Without any gear progression and gradual removal of skill based content, whats left in the end?
---
I still want good things for the game and I come back for new content releases and festivals, I am just not so hyped about the games future any more.
---
First panel is 1 person on the left of the anet pedestal.
---
2nd panel is another person with a similar opinion on the right of the 1st person and the pedestal.
---
3rd panel zooms out and 1 person is hating on the first 2 ppl.
---
4th panel zooms out further and another person is hating on the 3rd person.
---
In its current state, the game is made to be played a few days every 2-3 months, with some additional possible playtime during holiday events (samey fluff imo). Very poor player retention if you ask me.

Except they're dooming their present game. If you destroy your current game will you have a future?
---
underrated comment
---
A manager probably said they don't want to lose out on the server trans money, guessing milking now instead of trying to revitalize the game will yield more and faster profit, which is probably correct.
---
Is the game on the SSD? If not then that’s the issue. Try adding -maploadinfo command line in your gw2 shortcuts. Some people say that helps but it’s also nice to see loading progress.
---
It could also be your cpu
---
I remember being very confused about the voting stuff and the rapidly temporary content releases, especially because I didn't visit any forums or reddit.
---
then you only get 3k crits
---
You're better off selling the materials than making bags to sell.
---
If anyone could just buy the mats then make and sell bags to get rich quick, the market would equalize itself to the point where it would not be profitable anymore.
---
Getting crafting up is not difficult or particularly expensive and the crafting level caps have not been raised (except cooking which cant make bags) so there are many ppl who can make bags if need be. In other words, there is more supply than demand.
---
The 20 slots are not soulbound, so ppl can resell them when they don't need them anymore. This is why the tp price is lower than the crafting price, not the same price.
---
Bags are a decent way to make gold in WoW (or other mmos) because gathering from a node removes it so other ppl cannot gather from it, unlike in gw2 where everyone can share the same node. The competitive nature of crafting materials lowers the supply and crafting professions are more limited with 2 per character (like gw2) but this includes gathering professions, where in gw2 anyone can gather whether they craft or not.
---
To reiterate, just sell your mats if you need money fast. You will likely lose money to the tp tax if you turn your materials into bags and sell those.
---
meh, ive said it a lot, i will move on to star citizen..... ifi it ever gets out of alpha.

---
Practice. At some point, you will not really need to see where you are because you have the jumps "in your blood". And even if you are on the Gingerbread route you can still be a bit slower at first than the others and still have more than enough time to make the jumps. The players will spread out and you can actually take the lead if you take some shortcuts by making some more riskier jumps.

Rogue? Wrong game.
---
Can you really blame people for being disappointed? Theyve been supporting GW2 and Anet for years and how does Anet respond? By working on a **console** game.
---
Its kind of a slap in the face, dont you think? Many people are of the opinion GW2 is floundering and not getting enough content, meanwhile theyre looking to hire people for not even rumored to be a *PC* game, but a **console** game. So even if youve been an avid arenanet supporter as a PC tamer, you may not even be able to play the game.
---
This situation is mildly comparable to the diablo immortal fiasco 2 blizzcons ago where diablo fans who had been supporting the diablo franchise on PC for years were given a diablo game announcement that was exclusive to mobile.

Hey guys, tonight I discovered that I could take extra-wide resolution screen captures even though my game plays on a max 1920x1080 resolution monitor.  This technique only requires the use of a single monitor and doesn't span the game across multiple monitors.  Not sure if this has been posted elsewhere but it might be good for you types that need wide images for whatever reason -- desktop background, art projects, whatever else.
---
Let me know if you have trouble or other ways to achieve the same thing.
---
A lot of red flags in that Job Application post, it will be a bit harsh for a person to be found. On top of that the engine choice is a bit meh in my opinion. I wish them all the best, but they should be looking for more people on Guild Wars 2 , not on a console. From what i've heard at least, the company is not as big as some studios like Ubi or NCSoft themselves, so they can work with hundreds of people on multiple projects, this means a lot of their employees will be focused on this project rather than on Guild Wars 2, which mostly happens in a small/medium studios like ArenaNet.  
---
Good luck to ArenaNet with this project, hope it brings the devs joy and fulfilment. I just hope they don't abandon Guild Wars 2 too much!
---
No, I can't blame them. But people need to understand that hiring people who have nothing to do with GW2 to work on non GW2 projects does not divert resources from the main game. 
---
What made the Diablo Immortal so awful was the lack of announcement for any type of sequel game. They never even mentioned Diablo 4, despite people expecting it to be in the works for many years at that point.
---
That being said I would still welcome more news on what's coming for the game we're here for.

Clearly, no lesson learnt from the last disaster. Hopefully this company goes bankrupt

People said that the cancelled Anet projects would not affect gw2 either, and yet they did. Now the game doesn't have an expansion by the time it should have, and we know the expansion level features that should have been brought by sagas are just a meme.
---
Around 5k hours since release. Took 2 years break between shortly before HoT until shortly before PoF was announced or even rumored.

GW2 levelling system reminds me a bit of games like Skyrim - you get exp for doing magnitude of different things, but doing just one will feel like levelling is hard.
---
You can stand in one place and murder the same mobs for a few hours, but you will get more experience per hour for roaming around the world finding new places helping random NPCs and killing everything you stumble upon along the way.
---
Do you actually believe that talking bad about other games will make your favorite game better? We weren't talking about GW2 on this thread, we were talking about FFXIV.  
---
&gt; I not trying to "disprove" anything, merely pointing out and lol at something that is apparently a big issue for you but is 99% of gw2 and ff14. 
---
GW2 may have plenty of instanced content, but it's nowhere near 99%. It's more like \~60% instanced \~40% open world, i guess? Since the majority of rewards are tied to an open world, as of why it's not an issue to me GW2/ESO/Classic WoW/Elite Dangerous every single one of those games simply has a better open world content than FFXIV. FFXIV open world is extremely shallow and the game wouldn't lose much if they'd scrapped it altogether.
---
&gt; Again everything you apparently "cringe" or hate in ff14 is present in GW2 but for some reason your getting a hard on telling everyone how its so bad in ff14 but not in gw2. 
---
Telling everyone how it's so bad in FF14? I wouldn't consider 2 threads in my whole post history as "telling everyone", and yeah, it's definitely not as bad as in FFXIV. :\^)

Personal Story now feels archaic, delivery with all those static dialogues is atrocious, but it was 7 years ago, while 80% of the FFXIV in 2019 are still those atrocious static dialogues with lazy transitions and half of them aren't even voiced and voice over itself, at least the English one is fucking awful both by itself and in comparison with Gw2/WoW/ESO. Both GW2 and FFXIV have pacing problems, in GW2 the story unravels too quick, in FFXIV the story unravels too slow, but again, i'd rather take the one that unravels quick, because it's way less painful to get through and i won't feel myself like they're just trying to suck some more subscription time from me.
---
&gt; The majority of gw2 players actually just get turned off mmos in general cause of how bad of a direction gw2 is going, only a few actually go to wow or ff14 seeing as gw2 was suppose to be the antithesis of those games. Reading your response to that other comment o wow couldn't wait to play that lazypeon card lmao. 
---
You clearly don't know what "Majority" means. The subreddit is growing and the game's online clearly didn't dipped more than for a half. This is just an extremely dumb argument without any information to support it.  
---
And yeah, LazyPeon card is quite good. Was never really a fan of LazyPeon, but i always was even lesser fan of a retarded mob of fanboys being hurt over someone talking bad about their favorite game.  
---
&gt; What do you think is the best mmo atm [u/VinylNarcissus](https://www.reddit.com/u/VinylNarcissus/)? Tell me of this mmo that apparently checks all your boxes or atleast trys to. I would love to know what mmo someone who apperantly hates/"cringes" 99% of all things found in mmos plays. 
---
I like GW2 and ESO, because they both are quite similar in design, and i like Elite Dangerous for an absolutely amazing community and unarguably the best community driven events in the whole industry. I'd add EvE and Classic WoW to this list, but i can't get over EvE's gameplay and Classic WoW's archaic design choices.

Can you elaborate? Are those the guys that made planetside? Or another game by those who made planetside?

Yes please

Rito developing mobile and console port for league. 
---
I'll bet 500g it's more popular than all of anets games combined from release for the 5 years to follow. :)

It's fine, alf of the people counterjerking here will do a 180 next week anyway

it's just a holer than thou flex really, waste of breath.

Is there a location to view patch notes with regards to mesmer? It's the only class I play and coming back to it now I feel like I need to read up on just how many nerds it got.

And then there's a guy holding this comic yelling "look at me, I'm so much holier than thou"
---
I too wouldn’t want to continue working on a product that attracts customers like these

Yeah this is such a mixed bag of feelings for me but what kinda kills it is that anet is not an independent company like Bungie. In a perfect world they release this new title and use the funds to further more support gw2 if that new title is a single player game. But it's likely not a single player game, maybe not an mmo but not single player either meaning it will require support post launch. On top of all the revenue going into investors pockets. Idk... i don't really expect a perfect case scenario.
---
Well....
---
LS1 - Despite what this subreddit believes was a shit show of 5 min content with the occasional gem om between but lacked sufficient rewards
---
LS2 - A great season but an infuriating release schedule: massive breaks between episodes
---
HOT- Finally on the right track, great maps and decent content:stuff to work towards but community bitching lead to a lot of changes, some positive (better rewards), some negative (especs unlocked in a day)
---
LS3- Okay, lacked rewards and collections that rewarded long term play of the map (except Draconis Mons), great with the foresight of another HOT type expansion
---
POF- Casual shit show expansion that went overboard with mounts and underboard with everything else
---
LS4-Lets not even go there, bland maps, shitty formula, lackluster release schedule
---
LS5- Season 1 didn't work as they wanted but let's try again, this labrat game is already pretty much dead anyway.
---
This is Anet my friend, it doesn't learn from past mistakes and likes to put its eggs in one basket, they'll try develop something new and then fail horribly. Gw2 had potential but it got ruined by caving to the community. Had gw2 stuck with the concept of Dungeons, World Bosses, Pvp and WvW it'd have been way better off in the long run.
---
And if anyone goes to say "You're just a pessimist" let me counter that argument by saying: Look what happened to Wildstar
---
Ye, but considering living story episodes are basically just 2-4 hour campaign dlcs it's not like these devs don't know how to make singleplayer content. Teams changed drastically the past two years though, so god knows really.
---
Don't blame the actual devs who are badly paid in the industry and often work hard (many of the good ones moved to amazon and co tho).
---
Point your blame and criticism to the bad upper management of anet, for how badly they handle the community, the marketing and their direction of not only the game itself, but also them as a company.
---
Also for burning a very big chunk of the income we paid them for gw2 on side projects which all got canceled and wasted lots of money and dev time.
---
Just imagine, for example, where we could have been if they never would have invested years of resources for the Chinese client, which still struggles to even make profit.
---
there is a high probability, Alliances will never happen.
---
Hello! This question is for SEA players out there.
---
Considering GMT+8 Timezone, what NA server do you consider the most active in regards to WvW?
---
Me and my friend are quite new. We tried WvW and are immediately hyped despite the deaths and chaos of it all.
---
However, we’re in SEA and realized the time differences across continents. We often wait hours or so since our playtime is equivalent to work hours of the people in our server.
---
Thank you so much for answering!
---
what is happening on r/warframe?
---
go tho anets form then, everything is filtered there to be a happy place with fluff and all positivity
---
And where exactly have I done any of those things?
---
Do you think making shit up that other posters never said, is a good way to have a debate?
---
GTFO with your red herring debates and logical fallacy’s!
---
when your main audience was always the PC crowd and then you start making console games.  
---
ayy lmao. shutdown soon^(tm).
---
I love the game, but I don't play it anymore :(
---
I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
Nah, it's r/RuneScape for sure.
---
"How do you manage to do the JP so quickly?"
---
Ah, the old axiom stands   GIT GUD NUB!
---
So they are monetizing this game so aggressively for yet more side projects, instead of improving the actual game we play ... no way in hell most of those 200-250 employees are working on gw2.
---
Putting the focus back on gw2 my ***
---
If you cared to actually check you'd realize the overall sentiment is "I like this game, just not the developers".
---
I know, shocking.
---
Around 20k+ since two weeks after release
---
It fucking sucks too. I just wish we have an actual site to discuss about the game instead of people jerking each other.
---
FWIW PoF-s5 were my fav content as a newcomer in 2019
---
Thinking that all of those 200-250 devs are currently working on gw2 would be delusional common...
---
&gt; It still has potential go grow population wise. Osrs did it, ff14 did it. PoE has always done it.
---
It took years tho for those games to grow.
---
It would takes years for gw2 too, but considering how old the game is already, it might even be impossible at this point.
---
We'll see.
---
However, it was projects, plural. Didn't we hear about like 3 other projects? That's a lot. One more might just be alright, depending where they want to take it.
---
It did happen  [before](https://mobile.twitter.com/delafina777/status/1098736620780441600?lang=en) the layoffs and it will likely happen again if it's not happening already.
---
&gt; For those of us working on GW2, our mandate was essentially to make it look like there was the same level of resources devoted to GW2, when they were actually steadily moving people off of it onto the other projects
---
If running around maps devoid of content and ocassionally getting to jump over a cliff is fun to you, then who am I to say you're wrong?
---
Try being less condescending next time
---
shhhh... we won't talk criticism which makes sense here.
---
iF yOU dONT likE tHe GaME jUST leAvE, sTOP bEEiNG so ToXic!!1!
---
Isn't that the point of the comic though? What I got from it is that most people are like this but there's this vocal minority that is just too loud and complaining too much.  
---
For me, although I don't check a lot of posts, the top comments of most posts are these whiny comments, not the normal ones like what you described. So I can see where they're coming from.
---
I remember having a blast with that game, apparently they went and removed core features in the name of... who the fuck knows what.
---
I'm the exact type of person you're making fun of.
---
Why do I do it? I left because I feel the game is mishandled and doesn't have enough content to keep me around, I stick around the sub in hopes that it will eventually get better, the game deserves to be good.
---
Right? I'm still subscribed to /r/archeage and /r/worldofwarcraft., although I don't play. I like to look at memes or any possible positive updates and news. I won't comment on the state of the game if I don't know it though.
---
They also changed it from a tactical build-n-shoot to a lame arena shooter.
---
https://youtu.be/nw01uuIBROQ
---
Atm they're not even putting out enough content for one game. I don't think it's appropriate to start working on yet another project. 
---
And again, the fact that they couldn't release even one of multiple projects, which led to 100 people being fired, and then the first thing they do is start doing the same thing again? The level of incompetence is astounding.
---
Well, why do you think POF was so great if it weren't for the occasional horizontal or vertical one-time content you got to do?
---
As a veteran, PoF was one of my favourite experiences in the game if not the best. I wish the map difficulty was a little higher, but the amount of lore and details that went into each zone is amazing. I still visit the core PoF maps regularly and they are amazing in terms of art direction.
---
I just wish they stepped up the raid releases so we could still have more difficult content available.
---
idk why they dont do mobile first, you can literally get away with everything and people still throw money at you like mindless sheep
---
&gt; But people need to understand that hiring people who have nothing to do with GW2 to work on non GW2 projects does not divert resources from the main game
---
That's exactly what happened for their previous unannounced projects, who are you trying to fool?
---
Needed this
---
If gw2 was a single player game, barely anyond would play it.
---
Gw2 story isn't bad for an mmo, but its pretty bad for a single player game.
---
The last 2 episodes were basically listening to dialogue for an hour with 10 mins of gameplay.
---
~4.9k hours over almost 5 years
---
&gt; the season just started and im 100% satisfied right now
---
Well, to be fair, cool. Wouldn't make sense to play if you're not enjoying it.
---
I would argue that FF14 alone provides oodles more enjoyment than GW2 **even accounting for the cost**. But of course things are different for everyone, and especially if one has PvP focus there's few MMORPGs around that do it well so GW2's effort is not bad by comparison.
---
They better be working on something else if they want to stay afloat lmao
---
Tough shit, but they are not good enough to maintain GW2 on decent level or expand it apparently.
---
How about doing your customers justice first before you waste the majority of their money, they pay for the game in dead side projects.
---
Just look how Path of Exile devs or cd project red are handling the community and how much love they get in return.
---
I enjoyed the story, mounts, maps, the overall vibe more than the earlier stuff. Although lately after getting skyscale I've been having more fun in HoT than I originally did.
---
Which "Help the traveler find his lost mount" event did you like the most? The guy who lost his jackal or skimmer?
---
What about the "Defeat the group of forged ambushers?
---
&gt; And where exactly have I done any of those things?
---
[If you don't want to be accused with genocide denial, then maybe don't side with the genocide deniers on the genocide denial issue?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/efi50i/massivelyop_picks_guild_wars_2_as_the_biggest_mmo/fc4upbw/?st=k4o1syni&amp;sh=d68ec279)
---
You can't have your cake and fuck it too you know.
---
They already abandoned gw2 for years with dead side projects.
---
Whats wrong with the engine choice ?
---
Did Anet actually say somewhere that they would refocus on GW2? Or is that a reddit meme?
---
What about the "Defeat the group of forged ambushers?"
---
Or the "Awakened Patrol"? As to lore: we haven't played the same expac have we? Nothing on Elona Reach, gate of torment is a joke that is used as a forged staging area. This is how you effectively ruin a lore-rich area imo.
---
idk why they have the brilliant idea that you can use the bonfire at all if you already have a booster, not even to refresh yours...
---
Imagine what gw2 would have been like if anet from day one put same amount of manpower into it like any other successful MMO had. Feels bad man
---
Given how it took 1 year and a half for build templates that still had some technical issues at launch (not talking about player criticism on their choices, which are not my point), it's obvious that either their systems are so bad, anything requires insane amount of work, or they're bad and can't see the ways to make dev easier (like, I suspect build templates were made by changing everything that uses build data instead of adding an abstraction layer). In any case, I'm not surprised they need years for alliances at this point.
---
And I'm just sitting here, remembering when people called HOT a lackluster shitshow while loving POF more than anything. Can't make everyone happy.
---
"Help traveler #251 find his lost springer" yup. POF was great.
---
Of course ... and even if its there its likely just to flop as much as their "build templates" did and also won't solve the dozen other issues of WvW at all
---
It's pretty clear they would like nothing better than to stick a fork in GW2 and move on. Just because NCSoft cancelled projects doesn't mean they will stop trying to do just that.
---
If for "controversial" you mean "doomed game post" you are right. this stupid subreddit I filled with thread on this. You trolls who do not even play anymore should  Create a subreddit on your own like /r/deadguildwars2 or whatever 
---
I do not trigger anything I just say game is not dead and it is ok and you stray crying .
---
Always was like this . Simply they realized casuals are most of the playerbase
---
2436 hours since release, kinda in the rookie numbers lol, i tend to take a break for several months at a time then play tonnes before going on break again :P
---
They just should can it now like they did with fractal leaderboard its already to late and won't solve anything anymore at this point.
---
But anets hates admitting mistakes like the pest so they wont do ...
---
They are no strangers to giving middle fingers to their audience. They did it with Guild Wars 1 and now it's time to do it with Guild Wars 2.
---
I play it actively and I couldn't tell you.
---
DE introduced a bit more RNG to the game I guess. And the on min max conditioned community now complains about the "grind". Because the overkill 30% item isn't enough, it already oneshots everything but there is a 60% one so you NEED that.
---
But people then ignore the fact that the devs just introduced fucking open world spaceship battles.
---
Or people complaining they want a rework of two Warframe then getting said reworks and complaining again that they aren't good enough because the top 5 Warframe are still better. 
---
Or people complaining that the new UI rework is garbage because they didn't get used to it yet. 
---
Or people complaining that the new melee system is garbage because one overpowered modification doesn't work anymore. 
---
At least that's my guess. I think the game is doing amazingly well. The community, like every f2p community, is pretty garbage though. Honestly.
---
The difference while people actually want alliance is that is coming way to late on an already almost dead WvW which still have dozen other Problems which wont get fixed cause after alliance gw2 is done with WvW
---
Yeah, let's ignore the giant maps, mounts and metas.
---
Lmao, as they say ignorance is bliss.  Keep buying that cape in the gem store it'd be alright little buddy.
---
I wasn't making fun of anyone, it just confuses me.
---
&gt; Anet has all it's resources in ~~living world~~ sideprojects, basically.
---
I can't agree with your assessment of PoF. It's the most fun I ever had with the game, and the mounts are a key component of my enjoyment. I don't feel they went overboard at all.
---
There's not actually that many companies to begin with which fit the bill for being famous for a single MMO and have tried to branch out into non MMO games, are there?
---
Yeah, watched some videos and they basically re-released it in a worse form to milk $10 off people.
---
they wouldn't have the carrot then they could hold in front of the remaining players giving them hope and still keep playing for years lul
---
Meta's were pushover except for Serpents Ire, the rest was literally bashing 1 without any mechanic, giant maps are a detrement when there's nothing to do in them:lacking events. HOT was full of chains and later had more generic events added to it.
---
Mounts were damaging: they could've added multiple more enjoyable movement options over different expansions, like sandsailing, mountain climbing and freerunning: they went overboard with mounts and once again put all their eggs in one basket instead of just taking things slow.
---
I'm not against mounts, but I do think overall they made playing content more redundant than ever.
---
There's only so much kicking a dog can take before it bites.
---
So what are you saying? "Fuck it, put it on maintenance mode"? Ofc it takes years. Expecting to grow overnight is childish.
---
Personally i prefer how it is. I like seeing what other people are doing and i love when they make risky jumps and fall down in front of me. Makes me laugh every time
---
That's nonsense. An MMO, like GW2, needs constant development to stay interesting and fresh. Anet does not have the people to work on two games and it already shows via the not so expansion size saga. 
---
Babying one "life service" game as a company is nothing out of the ordinary. Bungie and Digital Extrem went this route extraordinary successfull.
---
Looking for codes too :(
---
You sound mighty salty, mate. Honestly, I can't specify things like you have. I'm not sure when/how played PoF, or if you played it solo, or if you got to enjoy the peak activity with the community and/or your guild, but I just enjoyed it all.
---
I played with people as much as possible when doing PoF. I enjoyed the experience of it, and you could consider it a flaw that PoF at it's best can never be replicated, due to the maps being basically dead now.
---
&gt;, I wonder if all the rageposting scares off people from sharing things. 
---
This is exactly why this sub is nearly pointrlss . None would post anything about having fun to avoid being downvoted
---
You seem weirdly offended by my personal taste in games.
---
&gt; particularly if it retold Guild Wars 1 in the light of the GW2 lore 
---
Fuck no.
---
If anything I wish it could be the other way around. Forget this dragon bs happened.
---
Are you new to the genre? Rpgs are filled with npcs saying get this for me and you'll get this reward... That's been almost any quest in any mmorpg. Either find something, or kill something.
---
2k hours (since may)
---
The game I don't know for sure. The subreddit though? It sure is.
---
It's a meme by the most delusional of shills that still believe that GW2 is still actively being worked on, and not totally on maintenance mode.
---
around 13.5k hours in 2680 days
---
You should try to find the few posts where people gave hundreds of bonus codes away, mostly ignoring the discount codes that were on the other side of the promo cards. Pm one of them, they'll probably be able to give you a discount code.
---
True story
---
I remember. I returned to/joined the game weeks prior to HoT landing. I recall the main complaint being that HoT on-launch was "glorified DLC". If HoT had landed with all of S3 as well, I think it would be far better received... probably. I definitely found myself like HoT more, as much content around it came out.
---
PoF definitely eclipsed HoT in positive retrieval, largely due to the innovative mount system, imo. I still think the GW2 mount system is the best thing Anet has ever created.
---
I still can't believe that back in the day I thought HoT was mediocre expansion and after PoF came out my opinion changed drastically.
---
Gw2eff has some nice graphs for that. https://gw2efficiency.com/account/statistics/statistics.playtime
---
4k hrs roughly since a month after release. I quit about a year after I got the game until HoT launch, and then again for about another year or so until PoF launch. Been playing consistently since then.
---
Four content teams:
---
Team Outfit
---
Team Mount Skins
---
Team BLC and Gubbins
---
Team New game
---
Three GW2 teams. I see no problem here.
---
Chance to revitalize WvW was when HoT came out and they blew it by forcing everyone to play on their overcomplicated desert maps.
---
Rofl... he didn’t deny shit either; he just pointed out that you’re arguing in bad faith and trying to use whataboutery to try and make some bullshit point.
---
Like even your above point is massively intellectually bankrupt. It’s okay though... I had a wee look at your posting history and it’s painful to read your idiotic zealotry spewed out over anyone who even attempts to argue logically with you.
---
You see, many of us have got used to people like you. We know you’re not interested in debate, we know you’re not interested in an open forum of idea exchange and communication. Instead you just want to scream buzz words.
---
Like how about we engage with the fact that YOU are the person who sidestepped the initial point. You completely belittled and dismissed my statement about 4.2 million children in poverty, with some twee Segway.
---
You’re intellectually and morally bankrupt in your stance and furthermore you don’t have the wit or smarts to frame your argument in a way that doesn’t make you sound like a hypocrite.
---
So feel free to bait other lefties into giving you a forum to rant at them. I however am neither interested nor emotionally invested enough in your “oppinion” to engage with you.
---
You’re dull and boring; your oppinion is incorrect factually and morally but worse than that it’s inconsequential, much like you are to me.
---
Now before you think I’m annoyed... while I’m sure you’ll say anyway to try and soothe your fragile ego, I don’t care enough to be annoyed. I simply “nothing” you, as that what you and your opinion are worth. I didn’t engage with people like you in school, when I was the top of my respective classes and you lot were eating the crayons, I’m not gonna start now.
---
Now feel free to try and use the old “oh you won’t debate me, because you know I’m right and are intimidated by me!” Argument that morons fall back on when clever people get tired of your bullshit. It won’t affect me, as ill still be happy, with an amazing life of travel and adventure, with a handsome and intelligent partner: while I continue to train for my dream job as a doctor, and the many doors and opportunities that will open for me along the way.
---
So this is me dismissing you.... shoo troll, you bore me.
---
Xxx
---
I think the concept of changing existing maps is much cooler than the small maps we get nowadays. Story telling wise, however, it was still a disaster. It was just "Scarlet does evil things that make no sense, but work because she's a super special genius".
---
People like HoT because Anet gave them a reason to do the Meta's, nothing more  
---
Everyone wants to act like HoT was the shit when in reality they only played it after 6 months for Auric Basin multiloot, linseed oil, and farming the chak egg sacks  
---
The expansion wouldn't have had nearly the staying power were it not for the farms and exclusive resources needed like crystalline ore
---
Core Tyria is so dated that even Anet doesn’t want you to play it. Boosting yourself to 80 is the way to go. They exist partly because the leveling content and the core content is mediocre. It’s the same for every MMO. By comparison the living world/xpac maps are a dream with mounts and gliding.
---
I agree, the only thing is, technology can change drastically in the next 3-4 years. Right now Unreal eng 4 is too demanding on hardware, but I'm sure that will soon change, and the new anet title might still take years to finish.
---
&gt; similar critique
---
Far from similar
---
I don't,  I want them to succeed and for gw2 to succeed.  The faith is dwindling, but hope is stil there.
---
sent you a pm :)
---
When PoF beta dropped with a limited Amnoon zone, I was like "wooow, look at this huuuge map, the meta here is going to be glorious".
---
haha nope
---
Yeah, that tayto gobbling chump.
---
&gt;ff14 did it
---
FF14 had to shut down completely, go through a massive overhaul, and then have a laser focus on a very specific demographic that was being ignored by the people at blizzard to appease casuals  
---
I doubt Anet has the drive nor the vision to do something on that scale with GW2  
---
Even Destiny 2 owes it's success to just doubling down on what it does well and refining it.   
---
What does GW2 even offer anymore to refine? Meta events? I'm not sure how you can do that in a way that will succeed anymore than they already have. They could, in theory, double down on WvW combat and go that route but all signs indicate they have no intention of doing that.
---
Your character is fully unlocked in pvp. What do you mean by grinding? Instead of gear score your performance in pvp will be depended on your skill and having the correct stats.
---
I’ve been on again off again playing it since closed beta.  It’s great for what it is, it’s come a long way.
---
Just to be clear, most of what OP said was the general consensus of what the community felt which is why they specified the S1 detail of this subreddit.
---
loot and experience :) as you do for every other boss :)
---
Should have realized that years ago, now it just breaks my heart
---
How do you not know what order to read? It's just... The order you read things?
---
What specific demographic are you talking about?  People that want tons of cosmetic and customization options?  People that want housing?  People that want to play every class in the game on one character?  People who want crafting classes?  People who enjoy heavy story?  People who want difficult 8-man raids and casual 24-man raids?  People who want crossover events?  People who want tons and tons of dungeons that you can play no matter what level you are?  People who want randomly generated dungeon side-games?  People who want a solo minigame of an entire class?  People who want a companion bird that fights at your side?  People who want NPCS that sell things for you on the auctions house letting you have up to 8 of them selling at once?  People who want to level a squadron of NPCs?  People who want treasure maps that open a randomly generated set of maps for big rewards?  People who want to have a jukebox and playlist?  
---
Which specific demographic are we talking about?
---
Actually it was quite pretty obvious since the very beginning.it is the reason I left wow and raids : I was looking for a casual relaxing game
---
Console?  Why though?  I get companies want to branch out but if you're good at one thing and dive into a new area, that's a huge risk.  I guess financially if Anet can support yet another risk, then go for it.
---
My guess too is that this pretty much means the end of GW1 and a large portion of GW2 content outside of living story.  Any content we do get like warclaws or new mounts will be a dream.  A new IP is a lot of work.  I'd imagine most of the company will be working on it.
---
Simply put, Anet working on an extra game will mean even less content than we are getting now.
---
&gt;  I finally worked up the courage to try the Snowman and Gingerbread paths for once. 
---
It takes like fifteen minutes to learn the jp so you can automatically complete it every time, because it is very simple. You should not be that afraid of trying stuff, especially when nothing happens if you fail.
---
I seriously don't believe they can turn GW2 around.  It would require a complete overhaul of systems that people just don't care for.  Classes, combat, progression, etc would all need massive reworks.  GW2 is a niche game that focuses more on its cash shop than it does actually making everything else fun or replayable.  
---
FFXIV did it by closing and completely rehauling the game into something else entirely.  ESO did it as well by rehauling how everything worked to change systems and the core gameplay loop.  
---
I don't think GW2 is going to do this.  Especially when their client is currently pretty garbage as well.  They'd be better off making a GW3 on a new client and starting over with a system that has an actual endgame and progression.
---
"people like HoT because anet gave them a reason to do content"
---
reddit 101
---
do a weekly keyfarm, get your character to 40ish if youre willing to farm 2 keys and have access to tomes, get a karma booster.
---
You can also get one from the soulbeast specialization collection for the ranger if you have PoF.
---
Do you guys not have consoles!?! /s
---
Definitely a big risk for Anet to make a console game.
---
I wont let em die untill they make loadouts account wide &gt;:@
---
Instead of improving your gear score you improve yourself.  Of course getting BiS gear (ascended/legendary) and the correct stats for your build also help.
---
You have so many "shitshows" in your list, but ls2 is suddenly great? Really? LS2 was a pathetic filler a-net puked out while trying to cobble together HoT and generally promote game from "casual, no endgame" thing to the actual mmo level. Which didn't work out due to accumulated cancerous audience, which lead to game reverting it's course and inevitably declining, but lets go back to ls2. Not only it had very slow release pace, releases themselves were extremely small and shallow, compared any of the following season. Even saga(tm) has much more in it.
---
Isn't the definition of an expansion literally just DLC you pay for (most of the time)?
---
&lt;replies in meme image because is too insecure to form arguments&gt;
---
I totally agree, but both opinions can be correct. It was [initially] a glorified DLC-- the biggest content drop the game had seen yet-- that reignited player activity to levels not seen since launch. Of course, it's thanks to LSS3 that really kept the flame going, imo.
---
Is that where the ascended gear that I hear about comes from?
---
16,225 hours, 2,281 days ( 6 years, 2 months ).  
---
Oldest/most played character: Necromancer - 5,012 hours, 2,214 days.  
---
I try to justify my excessive play time by how shitty life was when I started. The first couple years I was playing 10 - 12 hours a day but have since cut back significantly. Though I do still play quite a lot obviously, more like around 4 - 6 hours a day/weekday, more on weekends.    
---
And no, very little of my play time has been spent AFK. Almost all those hours have been active play time.
---
I understand where you're coming from. Here's what those terms mean to me:
---
DLC tend to be quite simplified and offer specific additions to an existing game (a new character, cosmetic, perhaps a new mission or two) - nothing too big.
---
Expansion packs essentially introduce a new world to explore, with a new narrative, often some new things that the player can utilise (races/classes).
---
I certainly see expansion packs as more than just "paid DLC", put it that way. But maybe I'm old-fashioned that way.
---
So is this why WvW Alliances are taking this long?  They putting their mans on other projects???
---
38k hours ? In 7 years is more than 5400 hours a year
---
More than 400 hours a month
---
More than 10 hours a day. 
---
It a bot or account Sharing and should be banned
---
Unless he is ill and can only play whole day but I do not think it isn't the case
---
It is like 5 hours a day isn't it ?
---
There is no collection for class balances, only for single skills or traits. [You will have to browse all patches](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Category:Updates)
---
They covered their bases from criticism with saga announcement. Like they said saga can be anything from a small irrelevant side story with nothing else to a next story chapter with a new map.
---
4500 hours since day one
---
could you rephrase it in a way that makes sense? it looks like it's english but..it's not?
---
fwiw people that can solo dungeons(effectively not slowly with trailblazer scourge) usually have solid mechanics and knowledge, allowing them to quickly learn other facets of the game with ease
---
this is in stark contrast with your average 250kp fotm pug that can't play without a healbrand babysitter
---
No, my personal definitions are the same, and that's just it: HoT was more expanding Tyria than it was taking us to an entirely new place, as it were
---
HoT map events at least were interesting and linked you to the ingame lore (yes, arenanet succeed at it there, compared to anything before). 
---
PoF maps have glorious views but they are nothing but a larger versions of vanilla maps with nothing happening around, not even a fucking meta about preparing for a war with a god. But instead we get to get hit by a water balloon while playing (not) casino.
---
I believe they went PoF way simply because people still cannot do a HoT hero point without gathering a squad of bearbows
---
"I do not play anymore , actually I never played this but played another game but don't you think was so much better long ago ?"
---
This sub is terrible
---
I think what happened with PoF is that HoT set the bar pretty high when it came to open world PvE.  Anything less is going to be a disappointment and largely, it was.  Instead of getting multiple new mastery lines, it was all just about leveling each mount up to make them better.  The map metas were pretty stale and Anet went back to making mobs pretty easy (like all of them outside of HoT).  The other big thing they really focused on where bounties.  Those fell flat on their face because of numerous issues.  The bosses were very hard to see because of the screen clutter and visual effects making their "tells" aka animations hard to counter.  In most fights, the only thing you can really see are the blue rings down on the ground but that's because they are so huge and not focused on the center of your screen.  In addition to all that, the rewards weren't worth it at all.  When you can walk around killing random mobs in the game and make more gold per hour, it defeats the purpose of anything more challenging.  Why work harder for something that pays less?  You wouldn't do it at your real life job so why do it in a video game where it matters even less?
---
I hope this all kind of makes sense.
---
I also want you to know that if you had fun with PoF, don't let others or the hivemind change that.  Enjoy what you love doing the most.  That is one of the best things about GW2 is the freedom.  You don't really feel like you need to grind anything out but if you do want grind, its there.  There are a LOT of GW2 players that only play WvW and its very obvious the rewards aren't good there.  They play it because its fun knowing good and well that most of them will never have multiple legendary weapons or the best looking outfits.  Its just not important to them.
---
I really like the little story about the woman in Elon riverlands who lost his husband and is left alone with his kid. 
---
Or how the Order of the Sunspears, while divided, survives in the heart of every sunspear trying to stay hidden in the desert, hoping to rise up one day.
---
Or how the Djinn try to endure and protect the desert from the brand even when it looks that it's a battle they might not win.
---
Or how the Order of Shadows hasn't always the best interest of elonians in their minds in order to not screw up and end up being discovered by Joko's regime.
---
Or the way Elonian society has evolved under the reign of Joko and how a very small portion of it's pupulation is sheltered in palace without being able to do the most simple tasks while the other are constantly opressed, killed or exiled by Palawa Joko.
---
There are a lot of stories around similar to those and while i'm fucking tired to say that yes, the game has a lot of important flaws and Anet is handling them pretty badly, I think that core PoF maps are an excellent piece of videogame narrative and the thing I most needed 2 years ago as a fan of the lore of this franchise.
---
Some of us like to explore the maps and interact with stuff.
---
PvP or S-PvP rather do not have any gear grind what so ever. In fact you can start S-PvP at lvl 2, lvl 3 (if on a f2p account) if you would like too. Gear in S-PvP is normalised which means that i who played the game since it came out will have the same amount of stats as you who starts today, the difference is that i have knowledge of skills, builds and game play that you do not have yet. This makes GW2 S-PvP about skills and not about gear. You will never gank anyone because you have better gear but because of skill.
---
When you join the S-PvP lobby (and match) you will have all your skills and traits unlocked as if you were lvl 80. You will also have the expansions elite specs unlocked if you own the expansions. If you don't then you will have the core unlocked. Core have a few builds that still works but the expansion give a lot more to play around with the elite specs so if you plan to stay around and play then you should consider buying Path of Fire (which give you Heart of Thorns as well).
---
Anyway there is tons more to say about S-PvP but you were actaully asking about leveling. So here we go. If you don't enjoy doing mapcompletion, then don't do map completion. This game have no must and map completion is just one part. Doing it later is not a problem at all. In fact it goes faster because if you have the expansion then you also have the mounts. So do mapcompletion if you want, or do some maps or none. 
---
Your main focus should be on events. There are all kind of events in this game. Usually you find smaller events around the hearts on the map and if you see one get on it and do it. If you do the heart at the same time yay more xp. There are larger events such as chain events which starts at one point and then many other events come along the way and suddenly you are at a world boss events. All of them give xp so go for it.
---
This timer will show you events http://gw2timer.com/?page=Chains
---
The higher level you get the more events you can join. 
---
There are also special events such as the invasion which give you more then a level for a few min of works. Shows up every hour on one of the starting areas. The bandit leader is a champ that can turn in to a legendary which also give a good chunk of xp. 
---
Gathering nodes and crafting all give you xp. Gathering things is a good thing to do anyway since you can either sell the material or save it and craft. 
---
There are race tracks and adventures in this game as well. The race tracks you will need a mount for. If you are on f2p account or have yet not got your mount you can rent one cheap in the starting area of the race. This will also give you xp.
---
Adventures in the core game is things like Sanctum spring, crab toss and kegbrawl and southsun survival. You will find a npc in Lions Arch who takes you to this. Silly game which might not give you the most xp but just something to try out if bored.
---
Every day there will be a daily catergory for you to look in to in your achivement panel. Do 3 of them either (you can pick in all modes) and you get 2 gold and writs of experience.
---
S-PvP will give you tomes of knowledge as reward through the rewardtracks. This will give you one level each which means you can level up through S-PvP without setting a foot in PvE. You also get those tomes in WvW but in WvW gear matters and being upscaled is not really the best thing. You will be weaker because you lack traits and skills and stats. It is possible but you will feel the difference in power if you go up against someone who is lvl 80 and built for wvw with all the traits, skills, elitespecs stats and so on.
---
Your personal story is also giving you lots of xp, boosters, gear, keys and other stuff. You gain a new chapter every 10 level. 
---
Dungeons. The story dungeons is a part of the story and you gain extra materials if you do them. You also unlock the reward tracks for the dungeon for pvp and wvw if you do the story and it give you a good chunk of xp.
---
If there is no group up for you (and make sure to read the text of each group so that you don't join a group who need something else) add your own group. Open the lfg-tool and add your group to the dungeon you want to make. In the text option write all welcome, or chill run or anything else that you feel is important. Add which path you want to do add, and wait. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Looking_For_Group
---
Also killing mobs that was not killed in a while give you xp and bonus xp. So moving in areas were not many people pass can be a good thing. Always use food and utility (you can buy or craft) because they add extra xp. If you have buffs use them if you want to do events or dungeons were a lot of xp comes in.
---
I probably forgot other ways to level as well but this are a few anyway :)
---
Exactly!  Now its just going to be like what we saw with Scarlet where you walk into a cave that was made in an existing map to get some lore and then logout after 15 minutes.
---
It would be wild if those were redeemable for in-game map/WvW/PvP currency!
---
No. There are a number of ways to get ascended gear. It isn't really required if you only just started the game however... 
---
You can craft it if you get your crafting skills up high enough. 
---
You can get it as a drop from fractals (special dungeons, but this is kind of a chicken and egg thing as you will need to start getting ascended gear to get the Agony Resist you need to get to high enough fractals to get ascended drops)
---
You can get it from raids. Raids have a chance of dropping some gear, but also you get special currency you can use to buy it
---
You can get it from WVW and PVP again with special tokens you get from participating you get gear
---
You can buy ascended rings with Laurels which is a good place to start for fractal AR
---
(its quite late here... did i forget anything?)
---
There is definitely a lot more of the third person. - Me, the Fourth Person. Except you are allowed to dislike it.
---
it is negative :) that's why it's upvoted
---
MMO engines are usually custom made or are heavy modifications of existing engines. EA and Bethesda's games are a good example why reusing same engine for a whole lot of genres and game types is a horrible idea.
---
Nothing outside of the ordinary. Digital Extremes (Devs of Warframe) released new content recently, in-game economy around it is all out of whack, people complain ok Reddit, but 90% of the time they balance things out in successive hotfixes and updates and things turn out for the better. 
---
DE tends to have a 'release first, balance later' mentality when it comes to new stuff.
---
I get more entertaining conversations from LA map chat.
---
In GW2 you get downscaled to the area you are in. So there are no one shotting of bosses and noone will be unhappy if they see other players. The rewards you get will be scaled to the level you are in. At lvl 40 you will get one box of rare gear which you can sell or salvage for ectos. 
---
Tequatl will give you a lot of xp and karma so doing that one is not a bad thing either. Tequatl also drop a special ascended weapon box if lucky. The shatterer have a pretty nice back pack skin that most people go for. It is a collection of achviements you need to do to make that one.
---
At lvl 80 there are other sorts of events such as Silver Waste were you can earn a lot of gold and then in the expansions more meta map events and other stuff. 
---
As for ascended gear you will get that through crafting, fractals, WvW, PvP, rare drops, achivements, season maps and laurels (this are more about jewelry) as examples.
---
The flavour of the month before railjack was kuva lich. For the folks here, imagine the nemesis system in Shadow of Mordor where you have your own personal, well, nemesis where they continually get stronger till you kill it. 
---
Problem was, Warframe's implementation... Fell short. Basically their nemesis system can only be killed if you manage to guess the correct combination of "keys" to kill them, else any wrong attempt will just instakill the player. 
---
Lots of people are complaining that the Warframe system is rng upon rng upon rng.
---
It still happens! Usually underneath complaint threads though, ironically :P.
---
I get that it's hard for openworld players to grasp but HoT brought a LOT of content compared to  PoF. 
---
Even if a lot of the HoT content was abandonned immediately; or took a while to complete. 
---
For example scribing and guildhalls, PvP overhaul, new PvP mode, rewards and eventual seasons, mastery system, map rewards overhaul, economy rebalancing / map rewards, raids, new legendaries and leggie armor (took ages to deliver but still), desert bl (lul), WvW pip update, and so forth.
---
PoF did what? 4 trivial maps and very fluid mounts with next to no gameplay to use them... And elite specs that were even more broken design wise than the HoT ones. Followed by not balancing them for 2+ years because anet is incompetent. 
---
On top of that; literally ALL post pof content is so trivial its borderline offensive. Toddlers can do it. HoT had some aspects that took longer than 30 seconds to figure out. PoF didn't.
---
I agree monkeys will farm whatever is most profitable, but istan has been more profitable than HoT meta's for a long time. And yet still they have more staying power than the PoF maps. And that's again talking about the meta's and maps - the only thing hot did bring - because if we're looking at the rest of the game PoF didn't exactly deliver anything. 
---
HoT wasn't the shit; but it delivered a whole lot more than PoF. PoF is nothing more than a last cashgrab before goign full casual milk mode (which is now); proving to many old term players that this game is indeed not worth the time and effort.
---
I have checked gw2efficiency in order to know which ascended equipment is the cheaper. It seems that refined envoy gear is by far the cheapest but it requires legendary insight. As I only have ascended weapons and no ascended armor, would it be better to try and raid or just spend the money in the most expensive ones? Right now I can afford the profession level up + one ascended piece if I were to craft the expensive ones.
---
I definitely agree on HoT&gt;PoF. The maps are amazing, nothing comes close and the collections keps a man playing. Also the innovative (compared to core) enemies were a breath of fresh air. And the gliding on these maps is frigging epic.   
---
PoF felt like core game +, rather then something revolutionary like HoT was.
---
works being done is not equal to works being done properly. DE did something good, something bad.
---
One month break imbetween episode 7 and 8,i said lackluster for a reason
---
not just that but iirc gw2 launch banked a lot on its predecesor, you can even see it now on gw2eff with how many have gw1 hom achievements unlocked
---
so the reasonable choice for a company that only has a single title and its sequel, both arguably niche in the grand scheme, is to make console games..of course!
---
honestly after stronghold and [unnamed cancelled mobile project], i'm surprised we don't see autochess or battle royale stuff being attempted
---
maybe some more, a few years ago used to play from college so I had a lot of time to waste on.
---
"overcomplicated" is a nice term to describe garbage that didn't consider actual gameplay longer than 15 seconds. 
---
It didn't take long playing on the map to realise that it was unplayable; especially on release. Yet this sub with all its all-knowing retarded casuals still thought it was a great addition. Remember, if you want an expert opinion make sure to ask the majority of players that plays 15 minutes then alt f4's back to PVE.
---
Sounds like warclaw and anet's MOBA PvP mode. :)
---
Dry Top changed once and it was only prosperity, then they unlocked more parts to it with ep2 and ep4. Also remember Dragons Reach part 1? It was the one where you had to do events in the other maps which was largely disliked
---
At this point i hope it will never come. There is simply not enough people left to run them. And no it wont bring back all the old players. They will join back for a bit and realise alliances changed nothing and will be what EU already are today, were people swap links when ever they feel their world is over crowded by fanboys and leachers. And then some servers who still have a comunity and wont move servers every link period.
---
haha!
---
Oh why did you have to remind me about Wildstar.. Another game I was very hyped for just like GW2 that felt nice at first and then the glow faded so quickly..
---
Same way gw2 is headed now, wildstar also experienced layoffs, then a focus on living world like content, then steam release then shutdown.
---
You should start with gearing your trinkets as they are the easiest to get and make the biggest impact on your dps. Next get ascended weapons. By then you should be doing t3, and get the occasional drop/enough money to craft a zerker ascended armor piece (and if needed stat swap that to the desired stat)
---
He didn't. It's the competitive team working on both. So there's ray, cmc and benP for alliances AND swiss. And not all three of those are doing back-end work AFAIK. Cmc being a new addition mostly looking into numeric balance (for these modes). 
---
Since they've been communicating with some of the wvw and pvp community, especially ben, for close to 2 years I think it's fair to say this doesn't "come out of his ass" even if it's not officially published.
---
Oh forgot that, I also have all trinkets!
---
I'll focus on fractals and craft armor then
---
copy and paste content just like thy do with festivals for years yay
---
A console title...Guild Wars: Unleashed?
---
Partnering with Neowiz, the extremely reliable company that brought you the critically acclaimed quality MMo Bless Online!
---
Sounds stupid right? 
---
Sounds like something Anet would do...
---
So hopeful, so naive. 
---
Alliances will never come. There are literally 1-2 people working on it, sharing their time with swiss for PvP (and warclaw bugs, and all other shit). 
---
Even if alliances come, they won't make a difference. The game is almost entirely filled with fairweather players. These are essentially braindead leeches. WvW will not function well no matter how you try to sort the leeches. They LIKE imbalance (as long as its in their favour) and will ALWAYS create it. That simple. 
---
If you want to adress this issue you need to provide motivation to play, and not play entirely fairweather. As long as anet refuses to do this (which they do because the majority of remaining players literally LIKE the imbalance; even if they only like it when they're on the ktrain side, will never happen.)
---
And PvE players that venture into WvW are the 100% perfect example of this. 
---
Alliances does not aim to, and will not provide a reason for players to interact and play with one another. Just like randomly linking worlds didn't.
---
Or they, you know, tend to afk... Leave the game running overnight or while at work...
---
sPvP is preatty much dead maybe only 200-300 worldwide still sort of actively play this mode.
---
I just asked here: She does still take commissions, but she doesn't do Charr characters. I'll send you her Discord ID via PM, so you can contact her. :D
---
I heard they were given forks to battle with the spaghetti
---
oh yes please ^^ thank you so much
---
roaming was and always will be the cheesiest and most unbalanced "pvp mode"! it's because of its very nature of simple dueling in a huge area with any random being able to join in..it's a joke that nobody takes or should take seriously
---
in zergs certain things have to be carefully considered, such as: boons, cleanses, boon removals, aoe potential, range etc. which create a meta
---
in real pvp, despite the constant casual player qq, being confined to nodes for winning provides great balance! sure you can run sniper builds but you forego the node presence for it so in the end you get "fair" duels/fights
---
tl;dr roaming is lul
---
That was over the Christmas break! Just accept you were wrong.
---
ANet happened.
---
we also know that they were going in semi maintenance mode once they did finish PoF and ~~focusing~~ wasting most of their resources we pid for them in side projects which are all dead now because they were just as madly managed as gw2.
---
And they still refuse to probably invest our money in gw2 and rather use it for yet other sideprojects...
---
I don't see where the problem is. We have many GW1 skins in the gemstore.
---
Tequalt ans Triple Trouble also reward 2 gold coins, once a day per account.
---
Well, you can't talk about anything, without LS being brought in and that's been lasting for years now.
---
Idk, i've been hating this game for a long time now and haven't played for real in over a year.
---
yea cuz f2p is trial mode and as such has severe limitations! it's meant as a taster to see if they like the gameplay, art design and whanot before buying..not a way to actually play it forever
---
if they buy the expansions they get lvl80 boost to bypass leveling, if they want to go straight into endgame
---
The legacy skin is only unlocked in PvP/wvw via the legacy reward track.
---
Manpower means nothing is there proper direction and vision are lacking.
---
try to find your server discord/teamspeak and join it. Most scheduled raids will be published there.
---
pro tip: add "&amp;t=XmYs" at the end of the link to timestamp it, x and y are numbers for minutes and seconds if it's not obvious
---
I didnt say that they shouldn't make it. I said that no one asked for it. Two different concepts. "Grow the fuck up." Take your own advice.
---
The holidays? AM tends to be quite active in WvW, but people in general play less during the holidays.
---
Careful there, all the casuals that have come to infest this board from the official ones will downvote you for your mean (read: true) language.
---
approx. 5200 hrs out of 1300 days
---
Do the WvW dailies and then one game of PvP for some potions. Then you. Can unlock the skins quickly.
---
Arenanet has neglected the game mode, so it's been slowly but steadily going downhill.
---
If you just want to get reward tracks done, choose a WvW exclusive character, use all the boosters you can, including Candy Corn Gobbler, and the new Wintersday gobbler, and start flipping camps, doing dailies and joining open tags when you see them.
---
If you want to make it more fun, just wait until next server re-link, which should happen soon, and transfer to a cheap server that is linked to Deso, Gandara, FSP, SFR, or any other active server. And try to farm it hard so you get all reward armor you want in the 2 months that t'll take for another re-link to happen.
---
They used to be obtainable via PvP mystic forge crafting.
---
When PvP gear was integrated with standard gear and PvP crafting as removed, they became unobtainable for a long time until they were reintroduced in PvP reward tracks.
---
Also, there's still a few almost unobtainable skins that can only be obtained via Guaranteed Wardrobe Unlocker. 
---
And some can not be obtained anymore in any way:  
---

---
You can earn the sweater in GW2 while you can't in GW1... what is your point?
---
Nostalgia is expensive.
---
"Mass murder machine broke, sir."
---
"Understandable, have a good wintersday."
---
The thing about GW2 is that most of its 'endgame' can also be done while leveling up:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endgame
---
Check out this list of Guild Wars 1 skins in Guild Wars 2: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/List_of_Guild_Wars_1_skins
---
Anet pulled the same thing before already. I have no trust at all anymore in that company and I am certain GW2 has entered some sort of maintenance mode once again.
---
Rare gear must be at least level 68 to drop ectos when salvaged.
---
Below that it's better to use runecrafter kit if it has an upgrade, and basic kit if it doesn't.
---
The official forums are [that way](www.guildwars2.com). Here we dissent!
---
I can't tell exactly how much time I've been actually *playing*, but  I have over 17K hours on record since release.
---
‘Shitfest not worth playing’ is an hyperbole though, whatever your stand about the game currently is... And I say this as someone that was extremely vocal with my disappointment of recent lackluster releases but I wouldn’t go as far as belittling the game to what Etheri said.
---
Gw2 is basically old as the other two you mentioned, so I'm not sure what you're trying to say here.
---
I laughed so hard at this.  It's funny cus it's true.
---
That's what dancing on the rope will get you. One step too much towards breaking [the rules](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules#wiki_stirring_up_drama_.26amp.3B_code_of_conduct.), and it'll be more than downvotes.
---
It seems that this subreddit has just developed into what side can dehumanize the other side more, while virtue signalling and acting innocent of any crime. Both are awful.
---
There's only so many times you can cook a quaggan.
---
They arent objectively wrong.  The amount of content and new stuff has been piss poor.  By your definition if they have done literally nothing for years they are being consistent with their content releases.
---
In the time that ANET has released a couple fractals and raids, games like ffxiv, eso, and wow have had a ton of fresh new content with new dungeons, raids, class overhauls, expansions, etc.
---
GW2 has been on an incredibly slow drip feed of content with pretty much none of it mattering and that's a major part of why the game is suffering to maintain attention and relevance.
---
Around 2000 hours from 2012-2015. Since then I've only run through the expansions and living world.
---
Imagine if that one fucking guy who told us to have a thin ray of hope for things coming meant something completely not guild wars related lol
---
This game is going to so fucking die. I just wish it was actually dead now so I can be more peaceful about the greatest game of my adult life being fucked. 
---
Sorry to keep adding to the negativity pile but I'm just so pissed that Anet had gold and progressively fucked it until I lost all my best friends and guilds to other mmos
---
13.850 hours in 2680 days
---
Look at the picture, replace panel 2/3 with panel 4
---
Try around daily reset time. Also friday wvw reset time is also a good time.
---
Also a few tips to increase how much wvw reward track you gain.
---
1). Guild tavern for +10% reward track gain
---
2). Enrichment for your amulet you can buy from laurel vendor in WvW. +5%
---
3). Celebration/birthday booster. +10%
---
4). Exp booster. +50%
---
5). Black lion booster. +25%
---
6). Snowflake blessing. + 25%
---
These all stack with eachother for a maximum of +125%.
---
Speaking as somebody who made it pretty far into the hiring process, new hires are working specifically on GW2 (I can’t speak for the higher level positions). There was no indication that anyone was working on anything *but* GW2, so take that with a heaping grain.

I suppose that depends on what you refer to as toxic.  Because complaining about the state of the game isnt toxic.  Its pointing out what someone doesnt like about it and maybe even how it could improve.
---
Getting rid of it will only ensure the game dies with the community that's left wondering what happened since everyone seemed to love the game.
---
The problem is that ANET doesnt seem to care what problems people have about the game.  Feedback has been largely ignored either because the devs think they know better or because the game is essentially in maintenance cash-grab mode.  Either way the negativity and criticism isnt the problem.
---
Everything and everyone is wrong except me, and everyone who disagrees is wronger.  
---
Every upvote for me counts double, and every downvote counts as a three upvotes.
---
I have spoken.
---
This is actually the first time I've heard of Jhavi.
---
So afk farming so still bannable
---
Sorry m8 . This sub is full of thread from ppl who do not play anymore and come here to criticize and say game is doomed.
---
But yes your post was stupid
---
I hate sand.
---
I'm not from SEA so can't speak from personal experience, but this website might help you make a decision? https://wvwstats.com/timezones 
---
Keep in mind what's active now might not be active after re-links (which will be the end of January) so activity can be quite volatile. But if you find a good guild to run with once you're settled that can help immensely :)
---
Quiznos discount code does not work anymorw. ANet have disabled them
---
There aren't many people working on it. To be honest, I'm pretty sure there's only one person working on it full time, and he's the head WvW dev, and has other responsibilities, I'm sure.
---
That, and Anet's code is probably way more fucked than we could imagine, because yeah, even for 1 guy it's been nearly 2 years now.
---
Best part is this is like 4 months after they assured everyone their new big LS was going to blow everyone away and instead we got a short, tired, half assed attempt at something new.
---
They barely support GW2 now, why would they support it in the future? You're 100% right, it isn't a dead game but what it is is the revenue stream financing the unannounced game this posting is for. If anyone denies that GW2 is just slightly above Maintenance mode then they deserve the heartbreak IMO.
---
Just answer you're question in the last paragraph (really not trying to be a smart ass), Arenanet is wholly owned subsidiary of NCSoft. NCSoft bought Anet in 2002 IIRC, so basically Anet is NCSoft just kept seperate from the NCSofts main corporate entity.
---
They had the manpower they just had no vision and 500 devs doing random wtf ever they wanted.
---
i love how you instantly jump from afk to afk farming. i guess anet needs to ban me too when i stand afk in mistlock and farm all those sweet nothings
---
The sweater is pretty basic but a fun item to gain.  
---
I'm just a bit salty about the fact the stuff that really sticks out such as the old festive items you gained for free after playing a lot on wintersday now are simply sold for gems.   
---
I've actually started playing gw1 a bit simply to get the old winterdays quest feeling back. You do different quests, have different skills and after some fun activities you get a cool skin reward.
---
Just fake those 250kp, who gives a shit. Healbrands are more about netflix and chill than actual gameplay. If you bring Div aRene and Healbrand both supporters should do the same so you got double the Stabi, Protection and general defense compared to just regular Healbrand, its not just the Guardian securing your ass doesnt die.
---
If you compare that to other comps you dont have that level of defense.
---
Healbrand are not about speedclears is about watching YouTube videos or if you need to /afk real quick midfight!
---
Content in this game is years old. Going for a speedclear with 5x dps in fractals is not effective anymore, why bother playing this game - watching the environment, dodging, playing mechanics when you could just bring a good Div aRene for Jalis ult and a Healbrand to fill the gaps.
---
This playstyle only came up after hard nerfs to chrono / druid and is way better imo.
---
You just want to get daily fractals done as low effort as possible... netflix/youtube and chill.
---
There are no other healers as effective as a Guardian, however Scourge is close.
---
Nice, I didn't even know that list existed!  
---
Altough it probably is mostly gemstore...
---
Sometimes the term "console game" is used in the industry to refer to a game that is for core gaming audiences and/or not for mobile devices, without necessarily excluding PC.
---
He's of the school of thought where "If I don't like it, it's low-effort/value"
---
You actually play the game and get better.
---
I think festivals are mostly copy pasted to be able to focus on other things.
---
It is quite sad to see it way ahead of the blizzard drama and by the readers way worst than a cancellation. ArenaNet being critical if criticism and not really responding to it unless it causes PR loss in the past was off putting. But this game I play the most and I have been hard pressed to pay for anything in the gem store lately because they do not deliver anymore. Here’s to hoping 2020 is a shift in a new direction. There are blips of hope, but compared to the past disappointment, it is really hard to be excited.
---
&gt; DE introduced a bit more RNG
---
To make a comparison in gw2 terms :
---
Imagine the only way to get ascended is to kill trash mobs, with a 1% droprate. So far so good. Now imagine that the stats on your ascended piece of gear are random. So far, we're still good.
---
And then you learn that the generated stats might be lower than the stats of a blue gear.
---
That's why /r/warframe is bitching about *a bit more RNG*. Because DE fucked up with the stat generation.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Potion_of_WvW_Rewards
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Potion_of_PvP_Reward
---
And no, the PvP and WvW reward tracks are completely seperate.
---
FF14's relaunch was 2 years later, not exactly "right at the start".
---
But fair enough, a 2yo game relaunching is still something else than doing the same with a 7yo game. Can't disagree with that one!
---
&gt; to focus on ~~other things~~ gemstore and sideprojects.
---
Did you mean that the most of current endgame can NOT be done while leveling up?
---
*Fractals, all dungeon diffuculties, raids + strike missions, living world + masteries, HoT/PoF zones and farmable events, wvw etc, etc..*
---
This. They have a large studio but their content production is slow.
---
18.718 in 2.680 days
---
but there is a shitton of afk time in that from weekends, when i clean the flat and just stand in mistlock
---
To people who ask, what is the problem with this ?
---
Well in GW1 most of festival items were free, e.g you can do the content during an event, and with that Token you get by just playing the event or doing other stuff, you can purchase the skin. In GW2 we have get it through the gemstore which some would say is still the same since you can convert gold to gems, but it was more about the Event, than just having a skin.
---
I hope i don't get downvoted like most people, whats up with all the hate lately in this sub ?
---
since i posted my numbers: im at 7 hours a day average. it doesnt match your preconceived opinion but no, i dont farm afk. a) i actually like to keep my account and b) for what? gold? i swim in that shit because i have already everything i want
---
Then you clearly have no idea about how much a console costs. In my country (Italy) you can buy a PS4 for just 200 euros.
---
Most any game that is .. I forgot what the term for it was, but let's call it continuously supported with updates and has micro transactions, they never see anywhere *near* the work hours that was put into the game prior to launch. It seems to be all about minimal work maximum income at that point. New games are just better because of that.
---
&gt; There is a reason she works for a literal no-name now,
---
She was able to find a job after 2 back to back social media shitshows? 
---
She must suck a mean dick/lick a mean pussy.
---
Looks interesting, having another game under ANet's name will be great. Hopefully they dont cancel this one too..
---
Looking forward for more info about this action game!
---
Pretty sure that if you are just doing it for the reward track you may as well just do it in PvP, there's a bunch of rank-farm/daily maps where you can do the daily quickly and effortlessly.
---
JP got fired for making a PR shitshow in social media public, full stop. 
---
Peter got fired for being a dumbass and backing her play. Full stop.
---
Act 2 is still my favorite Diablo 2 act, AC Origins is a great game, Nightfall was my favorite GW1 expansion/standalone, and the desert level is often my favorite level in any game that I play.  It's all about what you put in that desert that matters.  
---
Nightfall was an amazing landscape with a ton of stuff to do.  I love all of Vabbi, Kourna, and Istan.  It's not the desert that's the issue.
---
It is a neat concept, but I would sure love to see Kessex back to the way it was instead of the eyesore we have now.
---
Do you think it's gonna be Guild Wars related, or an entirely new franchise?
---
That build isn't up to date anymore after the death magic trait changes. Please update.
---
All servers are WvW servers. AM is a host server with one link so you should have people. All though i would rather come online during primetime if you look for zergs. Daytime there is usually only that if there are someone that wants to tag up or if something being attacked and someone want to tag up due to that. 
---
And locked behing rewardtracks is a silly statement. It is rewards for WvW (and pvp) players. I mean if i tell you that rewards are locked behind fractals you would think i am crazy, if i want them i do them right? Well same thing for WvW. If you want them you play the game mode and there is a lot of things you can do in WvW even if there are no zergs.
---
It was also a case of only delivering 4 maps vs 30+ in the basegame, the fact that at first you either paid 45+ euros for just HoT, but for new players, they also paid that amount, but got the basegame for free to go with it, getting a better deal than veteran players ( something we keep seeing, Anet not caring about veteran players but gambling it all on attracting new ones), and it took a lot of shitstorming for Anet to throw a freebie their way ( not to mention HoT came with a new prof, but without a character to slot for said prof).
---
And do not forget when HoT dropped a lot of it was unpolished or horribly bugged, it was the patch 1 year in that made HoT what it is today. And then I am not even mentioning how they rushed HoT's 2nd half storywise ( the scrapped Nightmare court Arc, how Dragon's Stand Meta was supposed to have another area and phase, etc....We see the same with PoF, how the Story takes a nosedive after The Departed mission and basically rushes us through the last 2 maps).
---
I see. That’s quite sad. I was looking forward to choosing a full world where our other friends are.
---
May I please ask for the site about the change of relink schedules? Would like to read more info about it.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Communal_Boost_Bonfire
---
I’m not trying to imply that I’m cheap either, I would happily pay a monthly subscription fee for the game to have access to the gem store content.
---
Git gud.
---
So "work" from home and  it is chat and tp flipping.
---
Not my kind of game . I'd choose a tycon game if I wanted to play a fantasy monopoly but I think it is a matter of tastes.
---
Still too much but it makes sense now
---
Ok Ty for explaining
---
7 years and they never understand the potential of their game....
---
Never mind. I found it in the forums. Thank you so much!
---
lol i mean yeah PvP is not as active as it was before but claiming such numbers in which you have zero access too is a bit silly.
---
Re-linking announcement is here: https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/94021/december-world-linking-update
---
Gear does not matter in S-PvP at all it is all normalized.
---
Ele dreams too.
---
They made the game "better" for solo players and casuals, so all the groups left. They repeatedly tried to make WvW more appealing for PvE players, and the WvW players left. 
---
:suprised\_pikachu:
---
Anet might be moving away but next is looking to have several big mmos and more on the horizon. Not sure why but suddenly big companies are making mmos again so I wouldnt give up on the genre just yet.
---
&gt;half assed attempt at something new.
---
New? This saga is just another lw season.
---
Same reason you do anything else, for fun. Don't ask me why semi-afking down a boss is fun. I've got no clue.
---
Unreal has been used for mmos before. Its a perfectly fine engine for a project like this.
---
I was talking about game on general but yes in PvP is normalized
---
Console broadens the audience. With unreal they can easily bring the game to both pc and console.
---
Aw, look at you being wrong and dumb.
---
Agreed. Eso and ff14 are the best modern mmos right now and both have good well supported console versions. In fact i have wished gw2 had a console version for a while.
---
So people haven't seen a max height asura, apparently.
---
If they had properly maintained and modernized their engine they could use that. But they let it rot. The gw2 engine is amazing in certain areas but 20 years behind modern engines in others.
---
Why? If they are making a game on unreal it will be both pc and console because why wouldnt you put it everywhere? Also it means a bigger playerbase for their next game. I fail to see how this is bad.
---
More like since HoT.
---
Source? "Trust me guys".
---
&gt;A new IP is a lot of work. 
---
It doesn't say a new ip. They would be stupid to not make it part of the gw universe. Some people will buy the game just for that.
---
Lost me at console
---
There was also Halloween and Wintersday stuff that came out shortly after release too.  So much stuff to do there as well.   They really did release a lot in the beginning. 
---
I don't know what happened.  They were too divided as to what they were working on maybe?  I don't know.
---
Well, Soo if you don't like it just don't bother to use it, lel! It's free and you don't need to use this subreddit! Why would you care? Just be happy with it and stop whining!11! 1!
---
NCSoft knows that their existing portfolio of games is aging and they need to renew it. There is no way that this project isn't approved by them after the layoffs. NCSoft took back a lot of control from Anet.
---
Why reinvent a new ip when you can slap the gw names on it and drive sales.
---
if that carry the title of Guild Wars whatever, I will be fall into it. Just too damn much memories with all these Guild Wars shits =)
---
I agree with most of this, especially the easy part.   And I'm not a good player.   I have shitty slow reflexes, but it seems that any content that required more than mindless ranged auto attack was discouraged.
---
Been there, done that. You don't need to tell me about the wasted story potential this game has lol. They have decent world building but other than that anything they do or have done especially in recent years is just bad writing. Like, worse than some superhero TV shows but people accept it bc it's a game.
---
haha...
---
I mean they could totally make a Guild Wars game.  It just seems weird if they are going to get canned on GW3 to make a console game within the same universe.  I can see it going the other way too where they make a console game because they couldn't make GW3 it just doesn't seem as likely to me.
---
She did nothing wrong. And it's funny seeing Deroir lamenting the decline of GW2 when he is responsible partly for so many devs leaving, and lots of people like me not funding the game anymore.
---
I came here to reply this. Have my upvote Duke.
---
Anet loves to waste their resources on living world episodes. They spend 2 months working on a story episode only to be played for 8 hours.
---
There's a few things on this:  
---
1.) The asura with the white hair is supposed to be tall by asura standards, so mission accomplished I guess.  
---
2.) I take some artistic liberties with asura bodies in order to make them better reflect their mobility. A low center of mass and compounded forelimbs only go so far at overcoming the laws of physics, so having a more dynamic model to work with helps sell the action. Also keep in mind that while they look tall and lean, this fight is still mostly waist/chest-high to most humans.
---
Well it's not necessarily about "slapping" the ip, GW2 is seven years old, of course they'll try doing a new game at some point
---
Found the twat! :D
---
Blame the publisher.
---
&gt;They would be stupid to not make it part of the gw universe.
---
You underestimate Anet's stupidity.
---
Thank you! &lt;3 It was definitely what initially motivated me to give it a try!
---
Dude there are a lot of very active discord servers, forums etc (also WhatsApp, telegram or what ever groups) where they talk about actual game stuff!
---
Why do you care Soo much about this subreddit? Just leave it...
---
You don't even try to search for such a "site" and start complaining about such "sites" not existing.
---
And it's not like people do hate speech or are annoyed if you ask a serious question... You'll always get a serious answer if you ask for help....so ask this subreddit about any stuff you want to know, check your posts if you get any answers and ignore the rest...
---
True Facts, my dude!
---
At least you got weapon swap now so you can kinda do that! :D
---
THIEF ALREADY STOLE EVERYTHING ELSE MESMER HAD.
---
For this comic it is pretty simple to figure out. The top 2 continue one another to the person calling them fanboys. Zoom out to a bigger person in armor. Then the last frame zooms out to a person bigger than the bigger person responding to what the person in the 3rd frame said.
---
https://www.thesenior.com.au/story/5722407/art-imitates-life-support/
---
No it’s not a real grandma.
---
Last time i felt like It's the end i gambled with my 6k gold and made 10k... Now I'm feeling bad again and I will gamble once more in the hopes to lose everything and quit...
---
They could at least close her eyes...damn.
---
PS5 and Xbox Series X coming out next year
---
as the dragons are killed, the magic they had are distributed among the remaining dragons. so Jormag would have a bit  Mordremoth magic in it
---
For all comics it's pretty simple to figure out. You'd have to be illiterate or a pretty big weeb to be confused by l-r, t-b panel order.
---
That game had a dope soundtrack and the gameplay was decent but I didn’t see it having any staying power
---
Jormag always had manipulative telepathic powers, even before Zhaitan was slain
---
Because they fired half their company because they failed by working on other projects. Now they are back to doing the exact same thing.
---
&gt;A great season but an infuriating release schedule: massive breaks between episodes  
---
Wait, season 2 released like every two weeks not counting when festivals were up.  How is that massive break or am I remembering it wrong?
---
The history will repeat itself,but i doubt this time, Anet will be "alive" to continue GW2. Last time they lost half of their devs, this time will bury the company itself.
---
It's increasingly being neglected and hemorrhaging thier hardcore players.  Anet's focus seems to be a revolving door player base where they attract new players and hope they buy things on thier way out.
---
All the games end game content have no foreseeable future.
---
No raids and fractals have been announced for the 1st quarter.  We are coming up on a year since a new fractal has been added and 9 months since a raid.  Mininimum. 
---
Wvw has not seen significant support in years.  Alliances that were supposed to make it easier for guilds and friends to play wvw together was announced two years ago.  No sign of it coming if ever.
---
Ranked PVP is a bot fiesta and nothing is being done about it.
---
Expansion level content was promised.  None has been seen.  While releases have been quicker they have been about half the size as previous living world episodes.
---
Yes.  The game is good for the price point.  If you are a new player there is plenty to be had.  However, if you are a long term player you have seen your end game modes die with little hope of returning.
---
There’s certainly hope for the genre, but not for MMOs which are updated as infrequently as MOBAs
---
Same. I majority play PvP when active, so I have a good grasp on it still, and where I can mention PvP as a mode that needs love, I still do.
---
Mordemoth used his connection to the sylvari, he had because in the end he created them, in order to influence them, jormag just uses mind tricks without a connection like mordemoth
---
Because the have too much time and content is never enough. They think anet own them something and they deserve to decide how the game should be and what is the future of the game
---
Those who want wvw to be the core of the game
---
Those who think PvP should be the center and it is not balanced as they want 
---
Those whose raid obsession could never be satisfied.
---
But they are a minority. Very vocal but a minority
---
Game is doing well.
---
I think they started to realize that making once off content in season 1 was a no go. They seemed to struggle with how to best follow that up for a while....
---
I use them with revenant shiro. Love them
---
Oh, wow. RIP a few hundred gold for me
---
Wondering what you'd say if story was released once in 2 years with no new maps instead of once in 3-4 months.
---
This is not the way.
---
Any prequel or sequel trilogy thread on r/starwars lol
---
Yeah it is totally not like anet is again shown to be investing in another game and keeping gw2 barebones. Totally not worthy being critical of or questioning.
---
WvW one is definitely the best option if played regularly; before, the Soldier’s Duffel from sPvP.
---
They are once again investing in anything other than gw2, open your eyes
---
It's a shame that they're owned by Tencent
---
Ironically OSRS contains some of the most brutal challenges in the genre
---
"Animaiton"
---
Oh no, there are skins in the gemshop!
---
Its almost like GW1 is a different game!
---
Lol, no. None of that makes any sense.
---
GW3 when?
---
They need to milk the money to the next console project
---
well, a year ago i was much more active. i was one of the more hardcore AP guys (and yet im still very close to 40k). and as others already said: a lot of players are still online and stand around while they do housework. hell, i did this every damn saturday. logging in, doing the daily and then doing housework, cooking etc and being afk for at least 5 hours. my real active playtime is more like 4-5 hours a day, which is drastically dropping in the last year
---
So long as one item they ever want is in the gem store, there will be outrage
---
The game is nearing maintenance mode as explained by Deroir on this [clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/WildSnappyGoblinSSSsss)
---
But skins is the only endgame reward in the game. Unless you still haven't got that easy to get mount or something I guess
---
What the fuck?!
---
If you post something about living world no one will bring the stuff in you just mentioned? Where did you get that shit? Actually if you talk about strike Missions or similar stuff there will be raid discussions etc for sure... I don't get your point...
---
And just because people insulting reddit users or devs doesn't mean that no one is allowed to criticize things ever again.
---
If you don't wanna hear the critique just leave this subreddit...
---
They started relaunch project months after launch. ARR launched 3 years after 1.0 and it took them about 2.5 years to make it.
---
I wouldn't worry about content releases as a new player.  Play the base game for free.  See if you have fun with it.  If you so, there is tons of things to explore and do.
---
The key is to not think of it as an mmo.  Think of it more like an open world exploration rpg.  The enjoyment is the freedom to go and explore wherever you like.  Getting to endgame is not important at all.  There really isnt much of one anyway.  Enjoy the journey!
---
Ay that sounds noice
---
Well, well, well...
---
Lest I know now where the gem store money is going to :)
---
It's a speculation................
---
That's literally how every expansion in any other MMO works though?
---
&gt; In GW2 we have get it through the gemstore which some would say is still the same since you can convert gold to gems, but it was more about the Event, than just having a skin.
---
But the thing is we get skins from festivals in GW2 too. We actually get way more skins from festivals in GW2 than we got in GW1, so the "problem" is actually non existent. It's just a made up problem.
---
Usually you have publishers and developers. A publisher hires a dev studio to create a game and they in turn fund and market the game. Or you have a dev studio that starts creating a game and push that idea to find possible investors  aka publishers. It's a partnership with specific terms. 
---
However NCSoft has bought the Anet studio, they own it. There is no "contract" or partnership or terms. They have full control over everything and pretty much every decision about the game is made by them. It's why there isnt even a CEO after Mike O' Brien left. There's no point for one to exist at the moment.
---
I believe NCSoft left Anet to their own devices as long as the game was doing good and stable. Only to realize the studio left a skeleton crew on GW2 and started moving people around on projects while the main game was getting ignored and withering. 
---
I can't blame Anet for doing that, no1 should put all their eggs on one basket when in business, diversifying is the best way to secure profit and growth. However they never had the freedom to do so unlike other studios.
---
Jormag at that point isn't corrupting anyone. He's the dragon of **persuasion** meaning he can influence you by getting into your head but that's not what his corruption is. His corruption is when you're all turned into icebrood which wouldn't affect Sylvari.
---
Also, I can already see people getting irked by my calling Jormag a he.
---
I'm sorry but that's not true. You can build a PC that will perform as well as or better than a PS4 for less than $200. And €200 is even more to work with. Just look up budget PC builds on YouTube. I made my pc for around $150. It's an i5 4590 with a GTX 1050ti and 12 gigs ddr3. It cost in the end just under $160. The CPU, Mobo, PSU, and 8 gigs of the ram came in an office computer from eBay that regularly sell for less than $80 or sometimes as low as $50. PCs are as expensive as you want them to be.
---
I mean we get way more skins plus other stuff (minis, guild decorations etc.) ingame from festivals in GW2 than we got in GW1.
---
&gt;Someone enlighten me?
---
Salty raiders, salty WvWers, salty PvPers, salty Twitch streamer star fuckers upset whatsisface took some time off, salty players who convinced themselves an expansion was coming instead of S5 that Anet said was coming in the months leading up to it, salty that guy who got banned for cheating in PvP with 60 accounts and then spent days trying to convince everyone it was because they used ArcDPS.
---
I think also there's an old salt who shipwrecked on the sub and hasn't been rescued yet.
---
Oh I agree but for this comic the frames themselves even have clues as to the order that are easy to figure out.
---
GW2 story feels like a GW1 fanfic to me. So I treat it as such. I don't consider it canon. Even though I know it's not true, it saves me some heartache.
---
Obviously there needs to be a proper tutorial, but yes, start everyone at max level (which won't even need to exist as a concept). Just imagine if all mmos were designed with only endgame content in mind and a great tutorial. . .
---
Therein is the problem.
---
We're not getting any expansion-like features though. Other mmo's also don't have 80% of the end game neglected.
---
I got sword and shield but obviously I only use double sword
---
They never learn..
---
&gt; I'm just a bit salty about the fact the stuff that really sticks out such as the old festive items you gained for free after playing a lot on wintersday now are simply sold for gems.
---
I mean, look at all the stuff we *do* get for playing festivals in GW2. 
---
Skins, Minis, Infusions/Auras, guild decorations, even an outfit.
---
I think whats so frustrating for me with gw2 is for years ive seen what it could be and hoped it would get there. Like they released new 2v2 pvp maps and i thought that meant they were be queueable , but they were dumped out and that was it.
---
Its frustrating because the package gw2 offers me is unique with pvp, wvw, and a big over world to grind but its so obvious that anet is just doing something really wrong behind the scenes. Besides ESO and DAOC there arnt really any current games with wvw and yet instead of being championed its just kind of there as its always been. Slowly but surely degrading.
---
They said the AT THE END of the sage we would have expansionlike features.
---
Awe just started and you started complaining even before we did.
---
Expansions are stupid . Ppl with time burst through content in weeks and others have to run not to be left behind
---
This is the best approach
---
New comers get real help on this subreddit and ingame from a lot of the people you just portrayed you smart ass...
---
* ~~Guild halls~~ 
---
* ~~Guild missions~~
---
* Guilds
---
That's not the topic but okay boomer.
---
Wow 40k means the back too. Congratulations.
---
This is an achievment since it means you excelled in all three modes.
---
the only thing that is completely off limits is the direct corruption of another dragon's minions. influence and persuasion are another matter. as for the release of magic after a dragon's death, so far we've only seen the consequences of that manifest in the form of other dragons incorporating those newly available aspects into their already existing procedures.
---
mordremoth's blighting trees/pods still produced plant like creatures. primordus and jormag still created destroyers and icebrood, just of the vinetouched variety. and even the corpses that kralkatorrik revived still became pretty mundane branded creatures.
---
Taking bets for mediocre and forgettable at best.
---
Kind of not really? I've played it for nearly 2k hours. The bosses are all super easy after you watch a 2 minute video to learn the super basic mechanics, so they artificially increase the difficulty in the hardest boss fights in the game by making it so pretty much everything 1shots you if you make a wrong click, and in the absolute hardest one, the Inferno, you have to spend 2-3 hours grinding through waves and waves of monsters and bosses before you even get to the boss. That boss generally takes a number of attempts to complete and you're punished for each failure with mindless grind. But that sort of content is absolutely bolstered with artificial difficulty due to the limits of what's possible within the constraints of the game engine and combat system. 
---
The other big challenge in the game is getting 99s, some of which are outright grueling and some which are pretty easy to get. But they are ultimately a test of patience and attention span more than anything else. You need 13 million xp to get to level 99 in a skill, some people out there go for the exp cap in a skill afterwards which is 200m exp. And that is just a level of sustained boredom for thousands of hours that was thus far unknown by mankind.
---
The game can be pretty brutal and grueling but most of it is just due to the rather spartan nature of the game compared to something from the modern era rather than any particular design choice (apart from the Inferno)
---
Yea, shield doesn’t fit to Shiro and it looks more badass
---
No, no we don't.
---
They spent 1 year and a half working on the relaunch though, the overhaul started really early in that case, six months in they already had decided that the original game was a dumpster fire and had concrete plans to scrap and rebuild it.
---
The idea is not bad. If people wouldn't rage quit because others were so much better with the same class as them :p
---
Dang, you just reminded me of FunOrb from Jagex. I actually liked a lot of those games but it seems that whole site was abandoned. I think it was left in the dust before RS even had the evolution of combat update.
---
Console, yikes.
---
these are really good, and I've seen these for every pack that comes out. I have to ask, is there a specific reason you make these super high quality icons? Like, are they used for some 3rd party plugin or anything? Is it just for completion in case some one wants to use them? or is it just for fun?
---
Oh god! Where’s the feet!?
---
Was the office computer from eBay preowned?
---
well rip
---
Didn’t the layoffs happen because they had a bunch of people working on a side project that never got done?
---
By console game they mean games that are streamlined enough to run on consoles, then ported on pc. This is like 90% percent of current games released atm. It's very rare to find a new game just for PC in 2020.
---
Honestly that's the vibe I've been getting. I don't take 90% of reddit serious since it's the same "hurr hurr the game is bad hurr hurr" in every gamesubreddit. Thanks for your answer.
---
the firing was ncsoft's decision. and they wouldn't be hiring more if they didn't have a green light from them again
---
There's quite the difference between "starting" and "having", at least to me. 
---
GW2 had a launch in 2012, but the devs started the launch project in 2009 or whatever it was. Like you said; 2,5 years. There's 2,5 years worth of distance between those verbs.
---
Seriously there’s like 3 different type of weapon skins, outfits, auras, decorations, and minis along with a few armor skins for each holiday.
---
Don't bother, the game is dying and Arenanet is rather insistent on killing it because in the end Arenanet is toxic.
---
Because doing the exact same decision that caused 140+ to lose their jobs seems rational. You cult members literally support a company abandoning a game you love.
---
I love the [playtime per day](https://i.imgur.com/IIkjhCE.jpg) graphs personally. Really shows how you feel about the game.
---
&gt; ArenaNet fired half of their company for abandoning Guild Wars 2 by focusing on other titles.
---
Not really. The terminations came from NCsoft, and as far as we know, it's not because they 'abandoned' GW2 to work on other titles, but were designated to work on those projects, and it was later decided that they weren't financially viable or whatever, and they were scrapped.
---
Maybe they have run some analytics and decided that whatever they have in the works might be viable, so they're allocating some resources to give it a shot.
---
Frankly, these threads are even more tiresome and low effort than a phone photo of someone's new legendary.
---
it's embarassing how everyone on reddit always thinks they're experts knowing exactly what's going on internally at arenanet. can't we just stop drawing wild conclusions for a moment and just admit we basically don't know shit?
---
Quality over quantity my dude. The overwhelming majority of appealing skins in GW2 are cash shop exclusives. 
---
I'd much rather have a smaller selection of skins that all have to be *earned* than a wide variety of skins where the vast majority are bought.
---
It’s not a baseless conclusion to jump to based on the job postings.
---
Ascended armour is the most expensive Ascended gear to craft, and it gives the smallest effect of all Ascended gear, a measly 2% stat improvement.  It shouldn't be a high priority to get.  The only place where it would be mandatory is in Fractals, where you want to get more infusion slot for Agony Resistance.
---
You can safely raid without Ascended armour, if you want to work towards precursor/legendary armour.
---
For one the lack of communication? We went from a patch every 2 weeks to a break, then assumed we got the last 4 episodes but had to wait a month for the finale? I'm sure you love Icebrood Saga tho!
---
Glad you are enjoying the steady flow of mind boggling easy open world pve and couple of hours (if so) every 2-3-4 months. I imagine this is the sole reason you call people salty for giving actual valid criticism.
---
Yep, and they are doing the exact same thing that caused 140+ layoffs. Keep defending that decision.
---
because that is the only way they keep the company going. they know gw2 won't ever get more profitable so it's time to move on
---
Like many of the people said here, try to get the server's Discord or TS address. Best way would be to ask in /T team chat, maybe all your server has is one zerg and you were just unlucky to never have seen it.
---
Gw2 is STILL profitable even though they are putting it in maintenance mode. Imagine how much more it would be if there was a cantha xpac announced.
---
Ncsoft publicly shifted cash into Anet earlier this year, it clearly was ahead of this new planned direction. 
---
Stop acting crazy, the sky was already around your ankles.
---
but it isn't getting any more profitable, read what i write. they are getting down and they won't get it to rise in any reasonable way
---
140+ families wouldn’t have had financial hardships due to mass layoffs if this was a good decision.
---
I just think it's funny. I do wonder why they've logged on to say it tho, are they simply getting their daily collections, talking with friends who still play? Why log in and stay when you don't play anymore?
---
I'm playing AA:U right now, and I continue to be amused at what people find to complain with GW2. AA:U literally spams everyone in the server every time you upgrade into a high tier item, and equipment progression is almost literally a dice roll. Every time I try to tell them how upset people in GW2 get because of aesthetics, they can't believe that's what people are complaining about. I think I need that parody video about a chair in GW2 along with a companion video regarding what a chair is actually used for to convince them.
---
It’s not getting more profitable because they are putting it in maintenance mode. You are literally supporting them abandoning a game that you love.
---
have you read any of the comments about build templates and their monetization? Have you seen the comments about anything added to the gemstore???? how is any of this gonna make it suddenly more money for them?
---
Me too!
---
I love it so much. I just wish ANet would create content that'd give me any challenge whatsoever.
---
I feel like a WoW player that's completed the final raid of an expansion to find that Blizzard have announced all future updates will be focused on the pokemon mini-game.
---
Live service?
---
that's not the point, we barely know anything about the cancelled projects, we barely know anything about their new projects. it's not like every new project in the gaming industry automatically equals firing half a company afterwards.
---
and let's be real: if anet never starts working on new things ever again, they might as well declare themselves dead. no company in the entire world will ever survive if they completely stop developing new stuff.
---
You brought it up by stating that skins that were rewards in previous game are now in the shop is not a problem.
---
They never stopped, they had multiple projects, now there is only one.
---
I use shield with warrior since it is actually really cool
---
Only a console is on the table.
---
So you work for them and know why the human resources did what they did ? No.
---
Stop you are embarassing yourself
---
Right, it's not as if the last time Anet decided to work on games that isn't GW2, it didn't butcher GW2. Oh wait, that's exactly what happened. Anet BUTCHERED GW2 in favor of shitty mobile games nobody ever wanted. And now they're doing it again.
---
Use your real account at least instead of creating a new one just to spam this shit
---
This. Vanilla PoF was soooooo much better than vanilla HoT. Anyone saying otherwise is delusional.
---
Fake account just to shitpost. 19 post only ATM. I wonder why u do this.
---
It really is when it comes to art,fluff or things that dont include gw2 content xD
---
Why u do this. Did they fired you and u created a fake account (more than one) to spam Vs anet ? U only have 19 post u created this account for this thread.
---
Well, happy for you that's going easy on you but in the countless hours I've put into other MMOs, OSRS still hold extremely difficult fights. The amount of precise actions per second required are nuts, from making a successful ToB attempt to getting your inferno cape. Not to mention Pvp
---
But doesn't every MMO out there repeat festivals? Isn't that the whole point of a festival. Christmas is repeated every year in the real world, and people still look forward to it.
---
Jormag has been a dragon of persuasion from long before Mordremoth even had a name.  In the Guild Wars 2 novels, Destiny's Edge has to deal with a champion of Jormag and the heavy persuasion that came with that, requiring Snaff and his golem to overcome it.
---
&gt;community bitching lead to a lot of changes
---
TBH HoT is fun nowadays because of all the implemented changes.
---
I'm really just a casual player. I like soloing and worked my ass off for the griffon mount. Now I can focus on the story and casually join raids if I feel like it. My favorite part is the scenery, best artistry I've ever seen in a game
---
following your logic anet shouldn't even have developed gw2 and just sticked with gw1 instead
---
Why do you feel the need to stalk my history instead of arguing the facts? This is why people call this sub a cult.
---
Would be interesting to look at you post and see the connection with other accounts .I am pretty sure u could be part of a bot net. Am I wrong ?
---
Got like 5 greatswords, used one for my account and will sell the others when prices go up.
---
Because the mass layoffs weren’t an indication of a bad decision.
---
Moving from GW1 to GW2 is one thing. But from PC to consoles when you have PC audience is another. Now imagine if they announced that on stream - live. They It's likely that they would've been boo'd.
---
Remember to use the official retailers, [&gt;&gt;list here&lt;&lt;](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/), to prevent any complications when buying the game. ArenaNet cannot help you with unauthorized sellers and using fraudulent keys can lead to account being suspended.

Why are you wasting your time commenting on this? You could literally be doing anything else!

Who crossposting too.

Rofl
---
so if they start working on a new project in ~june 2020 you'll be totally okay with it? your logic is weird.
---
&gt; exact same decision
---
but they're not the exact same projects!
---
Consoles dont have "F" buttons though.

Cause you post history is very peculiar. Funny one .

Neat.
---
Good from a business perspective you mean, not a gameplay perspective.
---
With the amount of choice in the market, customer respect is the way of the future. Give people quality and a reasonable price, and they will give you money, no tricks required. You'll gain another important thing too: loyalty to your brand.
---
but not enough for the time investment
---
What u exposed are not fact . No source . Just spam
---
It’s a joke. 
---
Oh yeah. Console with unreal engine seems like a gold mine.
---
it's the impression of a highly invested veteran player that has more experience with the game and company than most. on top of that he's a popular content creator and partner, so he is more likely to get a couple of hints that others might not.
---
it may just be speculation, but from my own experience i can say it is a very plausible one.
---
I don’t think gemstore pants is a long term company goal.
---
You can buy a few games for 1€ through bundles. And they expect us to pay 25€ for a skin. It's ridiculous.
---
Not if they fired 140+ people
---
It's the...thief.
---
Monstrum's sucks ass, because he intentionally omitted the fourth panel in his version.

https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hero_(NPC)
---
tl;dr The Hero's name and origins have been lost in time, so much so that the Hero's deeds have become obscure in modern day and often attributed to other members of their adventuring party. Some documents even claim that there was more than one notable Hero active at the time.
---
3k hours in 1,5 years
---
I did get the feeling with the direction of guild wars that the company wasn't really into it. Makes sense that console action games were the interest all along. GW2 is way more like a console action game than GW was.
---
So much negativity in subreddit (same old complaints disappointing/too slowly releasing content, layoffs, worried about the future, "on the table" joke is getting old, inconsistency etc.), but people must remember quite small amount of players read this subreddit. Most players are busy playing the game.
---
GW2 is still my #1 choice out of all MMOs out there. None of other MMOs feel the same. When Anet created this game, they absolutely nailed the "non-grind" type of MMO.
---
&gt;casual 24-man raids?  
---
Those exist in GW2? Tell me more.
---
&gt; I imagine this is the sole reason you call people salty
---
Nope. It's because you're a collection of pissbabies striving to make everyone else as miserable as you.
---
The way GW1 was written, I don't like to believe everything was accomplished by one individual. It's best to make it so that each campaign had its own hero; being the Prophecies the one who eventually helps out with the threat of the Destroyers.
---
Yes.
---
ANNNND they didnt increase the maximum number again....
---
For fuck sake.
---
Other MMOs get raids, dungeons, pvp content, races, and classes.
---
If you don’t like the game, play a game you do like.
---
Move away from it for a bit. If you play the same game over and over it just leads to burn out. Try something else
---
The first installment of Visions of the Past is about the new characters. [There's a chance](https://twitter.com/ywhre/status/1208109165924769792) that we could get others that look back into season 1 or at other stories like Malyck.
---
I think that I agree with you, Seem like I have dip my head in bad quality and hopeless game for a whole time, now it time for the real enjoyment.
---
Can you not be an adult and make your own decisions lmao
---
Imagine going to a forum to ask what game he should "invest his time in."
---
I remember the devs mentioning before (dunno if it a stream or an AMA) that they left the original hero's fate open so everyone can come up with their own end for their own character
---
...rather...you're not shackled to the game.
---
Do what you find enjoyable. Not that complicated.
---
If you think they're moaning *GAIM DED* too loudly on Reddit you should see them ranting on the official forums.
---
Though the official forums do break up that sort of tediousness with regular threads of "I lost a fight to a Thief. They are OP. Please nerf."
---
&gt;What happened?
---
They went off with the Hero of Neverwinter and got married.

https://www.mmogames.com/gamenews/arenanet-confirms-working-unannounced-console-game/

---
Not that great attempt. u say" should I move from this failure? "  U know the answer but it is fun to farm karma and shot shit on the game isn't it ?
---
Aren't you bored ? Which is the point ? If u want to move out so it. This insistent spamming Vs the game it like when a guy has been left from his girls and keep on saying she was bad anyway
---
Guild wars 2 always try to be solo story driven game with multiplayer aspect, like some of soul game (not sekiro) that you can co-operate with other and play it for the better quality story and gameplay.
---
One hero for all campaigns just doesn't feel right; especially when you see all the attention that Canthan and Elonian characters get in their "prologue" segments.
---
Well if you like it when you don’t read the sub, then get off the sub! Don’t over complicate things. If you like the game don’t let others ruin it for you. If you aren’t having fun, maybe take a break.
---
You get so many relics from dailies, that you can afford everything - bags, clovers and ad infinitum. Unless you want to grind Fractal God ofc, which might not be an option for some players, because you have to do cms+t4+recs for 280days every day, or 600 days without cms. 
---
Yes you can't resell them and you don't have to lol. Just use them on all your characters. Anyway, it's just one of many options and people can decide which is more suitable for them.
---
I know this was a few months back, but so glad to see someone else post about this. Seen this with oddly enough BB, and another server. I was insulted in map chat by a player for suggesting a thief was using something like this and told he was "just good". I couldn't get a good clip like yours because he also stealthed a lot, but same thing. I reported it and I haven't seen the guy online in a while but that could mean anything really.
---
I think you forgot to say "in your opinion" because it actually can be perceived as a problem. It's actually Anet and GW2's biggest problem where nothing is made unless they can monetize it 
---
In my opinion, it would have been a nice nod from Anet to include those GW1 skins in the current GW2 festivals (see how that works?).  Maybe players don't mind paying for it but why justify Anet "milking the whales" just to finance a console game that in all likelihood have nothing to do with GW2?
---
It might be that they wanna launch GW3 in consoles as well, just like FF14. Hopefully!
---
I just want to love it, Surely there are some fun things about it but compare to the whole picture that many people on this subreddit point it out to be It's still a "failure".
---
I just want to love it, but also thinks that Is it a time that I open my mind and accept the truth many people have said that It's not good and move on?
---
It's easy to dismiss legitimate criticism of anything if you dress it all up as 'complaining'. 
---
Nobody ignored the devs introducing 'fucking open world spaceship battles', but as usual, their implementation of it is fundamental wrong because the stat generation of gear pieces allows for two items of the same tier and rarity to have wildly different numbers, completely killing the concept of rarity in the first place.
---
A bad rework of a warframe is a bad rework. If you don't understand the issue in the first place and then implement your own solution to it to make people shut up without understanding the root cause, it's not going to be looked upon kindly.
---
The new UI is not good, objectively. It was the brainchild of one person who couldn't not accept criticism of it and refused to admit it was not good, despite the fact it took away information from you, requires hovering over things when it can display text in the bounds of unoccupied space around it, and prioritises showing you shiny objects instead of anything you need to know about it.
---
The through-line here is a dev team consistently ignoring the finer points of criticism and slapping on whatever band-aid they think is appropriate at the time, when there are many people articulating what they think is wrong.
---
They probably would have if Blizzard hadn't poisoned that well with the immortal "You guys all have phones right?" fiasco.
---
Adulthood means you do what u like and do not care about others.

If everyone would say your girlfriend is ugly but u still like her would u leave her ?

If everyone would say this game is bad but u still have fun why should u care ?

How old are you? 12?

You being bad on a map doesn't make the map bad.

Talkhora tho, jfc...

It is a game and for next 5 years servers will still be up so if u have fun just play
---
Sweet. Very cool, and thanks for the response.
---
one of my rented henchies was more literate than me and i let him write down all our adventures together. turns out he replaced me with himself as the hero and the book was a bestseller.
---
i died in a poorhouse, choked on my own ale vomit. was a better fate as syphilis was going to take me anyway.
---
There's a little dialogue at the temple of Kormir in Divinity's Reach iirc. Not much, just that their name was lost?
---
GW1 btw tells the story of Devona's guild and it's members rather than the "hero" one. Which is why these NPCs are at every outpost.
---
i totally agree with you, and this year has been lacklustre for content except for bajora marches, which while small it was brilliant.
---
however i am still lost in the original game and xpacs, there are a million more hours of gameplay in every mode i still havent done to get more achievements and skins, so for me i dont see an end to the game in the foreseeable future.
---
unless they pull a swtor and put every piece of armour in an rng box and call it progression, i was enjoying that game until then and dumped them within 6 months of its implementation.
---
It’s all preference man. I can’t stand PoE. The end game is just see how fast you can teleport around the map and aggressively click on the enemies to kill them. Some top tier boredom.
---
Yes dont play this game
---
Thank you! I am honored to be even considered. :)

---
The Hero's deeds were left open so that it doesn't conflict with the headcanon of sensitive GW2 carebears who might have their feefees hurt.
---
I wish I were joking.
---
yeah ikr imagine not wanting to take the risk of wasting time on a game only to find out after 30+ hours that the endgame content you want to actually engage in is basically ignored and underdeveloped by the game devs. Much better to potentially waste dozens of hours to figure that on your own than to ask a subreddit filled with people that have already put that time in and would already know the answer
---
You need to provide actual proof of what your saying otherwise you are just acting like a troll.
---
maybe that video that we saw earlier this year that looked like guildwars 2 characters, but everything was off, too colourful and nothing looked like ingame assets, could be the console version of guildwars 3 intro video?

Go to Domain of Kourna to find out what happened to our character from GW1. There is a bit of lore tie in there.
---
The one in ESO is pretty messed up.
---
Well, i hardly can be considered a mob, wasn't "defending" anything and didn't offend anyone until FFXIV fans started accusing me of some shit instead of actually discussing the game flaws.

And you're still a **dumb fuck** if you think that pointing other's flaws will make you less flawed.
---
There's no irony, buddy. ;3

P.S. i was actually shaking trying to hold myself from joking "See, i actually played FFXIV! :^)"

Of the shared inventory slots? The max is 24… There's a certain point at which the bank contract is a more economical decision.

Considering the "new car" in this case is a ps4 that released in 2013 I'd say it makes perfect sense.

You're just one perspective and that's all find and dandy but there is more than just one perspective on this matter. It's not all so yin and yang. There is a mix in everything.

Our guild is taking a serious look at New World, one of Amazon's flag ship title.

It's not a direct replacement to GW2, but it has alot of promise.  Really I just want to see what is the result of Amazon sucking up all this talent in the industry the past few years is actually going to yeild.

I'll take the 10 year old Porsche. In fact a lot of people would. I'm not saying that buying a PS4 is a bad choice or that building a budget PC is the only choice but it is a totally reasonable and realistic one.

You said:
---
&gt;In my country (Italy) you can buy a PS4 for just 200 euros. I don't even think that is possibile to build a fully working pc with this budget.
---
My point is that it's totally possible to build a fully working PC on less than that budget that even performs better than the PS4.

Jormag is a "he" in the classical storytelling sense. While Kralk was identified by Aurene as her Grand*father* or is highly likely that these dragons aren't breeding in the conventional sense. Otherwise, who was Glint's mother, and who was Aurene's father. Jormag is a male in the same sense that the Chirstian biblical God is male; quite unlikely he's running around boning some female variant of himself and more likely to portray a father-figure.
---
At first i thought they were making a witty joke...now i dont know

You can form an opinion of one expansion without it being a commentary on the other  
---
I never said "HoT not good therefore, PoF better"
---
I never understood that statement either.  I mean Super Mario Bros or Legend of Zelda is great for new players as well.  Most games are good for new players.  Very few are good for long term players.  If you want to play a new game that's good for a little while there's tons and tons to choose from so why pick GW2 over those?  If you want a game with good endgame content that keeps getting released then GW2 falls horribly short.
---
People also like to say GW2 is a story driven game but so are most big MMOs these days anyway.  Thing is they have better stories, more lore and longer story releases than GW2 while still releasing endgame content so GW2 has no edge there either.
---
I mean if your thing is grinding gold doing open world faceroll content to buy fashion items or you enjoy going from meta event to meta event to world boss to world boss then I guess GW2 is the best?
---
Its not about economical decision.
---
I know alot of people who would easily buy 24 more and everytime shared inv slots come back, we hope that the max number is increased.
---
Thats one of the problems i have with the gem store.
---
Why not sell what people want to buy? Why limits?
---
Isn't there a Doctor Who episode along those lines?
---
I'd rather be a twat than a cringey weeb
---
I don't think it's a terrible way to make content. Season 2 and 3 I honestly really enjoyed, Season 3 in particular all the maps felt really fun and unique to me. 
---
I do think it has grown stale in its execution though. Season 4 and 5 both feel pretty stale to me overall.
---
i don't see anything wrong with this.
---
might be because of all the snowflakes 🤔
---
For anyone thinking about getting the royal terrace pass: Don't. You'll get the divinity's reach loading times every time you use it.
---
If this ends up becoming gw3 or whatever sequel, i will be kinda happy though. There is so much you can do with gw2 now, it is time to move on to a better engine where they know what they are doing with it instead of padding out and patching out something so bad that they rather not touch the content in fear of the code(remember this being a word of a dev of dungeons). A new game would mean new everything too, new modes, classes so on, it would feel a lot better than some expansion that will die out fast again because anet can't decide which playerbase to focus.
---
&gt;That is one way to describe it
---
Correct. I did say it didn't I?
---
You can do either, pick up playing with your Charrdian or make a new character.  Whatever you do, don't delete your current level 80, as there'll be lots of birthday gifts to claim.
---
it was confirmed.

---
“New” meaning *brand new*, not *newly released*.
---
Comparing the price of first hand hardware to second hand hardware is disingenuous in this scenario. Nobody is surprised that a gaming PC built with second hand components is cheaper than a first hand PS4.
---
If you start a new character and a new class you'll want to level up on core game slowly and figure it out until you feel comfortable. Expansion content is all level 80 stuff and onwards. Difficulty level goes up in expansion content as well in terms of pve combat and even complexity of terrain and navigation. 
---
Some might suggest starting the first story content of PoF so you can unlock the raptor to use throughout the game to make life a bit easier. Regardless you'll want to take your time to relearn the game and your classes.
---
HoT maps are very vertical and complicated, I'd suggest PoF before HoT if you're not too concerned about storyline chronology
---
You'll have tons of fun once you get comfortable with the expansion content. It's really amazing and breathtaking. 
---
Quick notes for expansion content:
---
- hero points unlock classes' expansion elite spec builds
---
- mastery points unlock abilities such as navigation things like gliding, mounts and more, it's a progressive system, so take it step by step
---
- meta events on maps take many ppl and multiple paths to achieve
---
- bounty hunts on PoF maps are on boards that players can activate and they are group event bosses
---
If you're NA, I spend quite a lot of time online helping new players so certainly hmu via PM
---
GW2 still their cow to milk while working on "side projects", eh? I wonder for how long it has been going on. Years... Well, they aren't milking me anymore, that's for sure.
---
Wait for it, Anet will make a post on how they will deliver this great console game and keep GW2 alive just to keep you hooked on the gemstore until they finally say they're moving on and this becomes another GW1.
---
There is a bit of difference between a live service game and an mmo to be fair. Destiny clones have been coming out for a while but full fledged mmos havent been.
---
The heavy armor there (heavy scale) is a very slight reskin of a much more readily available heavy set (worn scale), which is probably the one seen around more. It's "unique" with heavy airquotes, unlike the tribal armor which is proper unique.
---
The reward tracks take a bit of time, but if you want one of those pieces they are at least still semi-readily available that way. 
---
(I forget exactly which pieces are narrowly available where, but I remember wanting a pair of pants a while back enough to run a character up through lvl 80 personal story because they weren't conveniently available elsewhere. Not sure if that was a legacy armor piece, though.)

---
I know it’s unlikely, but I’m really hoping for a co-op Guild Wars lore action-adventure game with real story substance.  
---
I’m guessing a “Liyve Survuss” model is what they’re creating.  
---
Also, they’ve probably been working on this for awhile so all it really confirms is that people who were mindlessly defending the current “content” releases need to find a new talking point.  This certainly doesn’t bode well for GW2 and should give everyone less incentive to spend real money on GeMs.
---
What a pretty toon
---
20 slots from fractal vendor are pretty dirt cheap
---
&gt; My point is that it's totally possible to build a fully working PC on less than that PS4 budget that even performs better than the PS4.
---
You can also buy a second hand PS4 for even cheaper lol. A brand new gaming PC is far more expensive than a brand new games console.
---
As an adult who met his wife in this game and works full time now: There are far better games out there that will be more respectful with your time and money. Once you move on you wake up.
---
And no, no game, as good as it gets, deserves you to be a white knight.
---
I'd hesitate to call that a likely answer.  We saw what Joko did to Koss and Tahlkora, animating and controlling one, and imprisoning the other when he was unable to control her post-animation.  If Joko had killed the Hero of Nightfall, there would have to be some Awakened version of him/her somewhere, or at least some monument to the titanic deed.
---
The hero might have moved on somewhere else by the time Koss fought Joko, or already been dead, or perhaps helped Koss and had to flee when Koss was killed.  I just don't think we can go with the assumption that Joko killed the hero, since it'd be very out of character for Joko not to gloat somehow about that.
---
My view based on the various dialogue (mainly [Young Heroes of Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Young_Heroes_of_Tyria)) is that each campaign introduced a new hero, and said heroes showed up for subsequent storylines up to and until EotN.
---
Under this implication, the Ascalonian Hero would have been around for every campaign, including Nightfall, but it was the Sunspear Hero who was the Hero of Nightfall and led the fight against Abaddon.
---
Because anet likes to artificial limits their content so they have something to sell later on
---
&gt; Why is everyone crying about future of GW2?
---
Because this is Reddit. People come here, to do either this or to make fluff posts.
---
Everything he said in that clip is not wrong though. He basically shared what he considered his "gut feeling" when it comes to the future of GW2 and if you're even moderately realistic you'd know by know many veteran players share his sentiment completely.
---
There is nothing in the foreseeable future in regards to Raids/Fractals/PvP/WvW. Which makes the outlook on anything remotely interesting for those modes quite bleak.
---
All content creation teams have basically been working on nothing but Living Story as has been made clear by their recent "roadmap" post. Which still told us nothing. The team that was working on "surprise content" has basically been revealed to be working on some kind of Charr spin off Living Story that focuses on Rytlock's son Ryland Steelcatcher. So it's not like they've been doing work on stuff that many have voiced they would have liked to see (Raids, PvP, Fractals or WvW). Ofcourse the Charr furry roleplaying legion is having a field day, cus more Charr content.
---
And he might not be Anet staff, but as Keruli eloquently pointed out, he is still a partner and content creator. Chances are he is privy to just that tiny speck more insight then you and me. And even if that is still not the case, he along with myself and many others, have quite a lot of time invested into the game and we have garnered our share of experience with Anet's shenanigans. So there are quite a few assumptions we can make that are perfectly valid and quite safe to make...i mean, the story is written on the wall here. All you have to do is open your eyes.
---
point is the first hand hardware in a ps4 is approching a decade old so its not really comparable. you cant say "oh why dont you just buy a brand new pc for 200 dollars?" well.. because good luck finding a 10 year old pc for sale that isnt used. the reason you can buy a "brand new" ps4 for so cheap is because its at the end of its "lifespan". 
---
if you want to compare the cost to build a gaming machine vs buying a console you have to be fair about it. a newly released console vs new computer components. or a 7 year old gaming console thats JUST about to get replaced by the new system.. vs refirbished or used computer components. 
---
do you see what im saying here? when a new console comes out using new parts its generally 400-500 dollars. you can easily build a system for that much using all unused parts, but finding 10 year old computer parts that are not used.. thats not so easy.
---
Or give your gold to me :p
---
POF are the harder ones to get when you have most of them. I finished the last dozen or so i needed (the ones harder to get) by doing fractal achievements
---
R A Y O F H O P E
---
I only used it as convenience when there was a festival, but now they have the festival tomes so that’s kind useless now. The mistlock pass is way more worth it imo.
---
Abaddon is a night ppt server nowadays. The server is dead during daytime.
---
&gt;  when a new console comes out using new parts its generally 400-500 dollars. you can easily build a system for that much using all unused parts, but finding 10 year old computer parts that are not used.. thats not so easy.
---
I disagree. Consoles are sold at a loss.
---
nuts for who? Woox solod and completed all of that shit the same day most of it was released with the exception of inferno which took him what like 3-4 days? WoW has final  bosses that took weeks to complete at 16-18hrs raid days, seven days a week.
---
On another note, this is what I'll never understand regarding Anet.
---
People find out that they are working on stuff through job applications rather than announcements, sometimes years prior.
---
Can't they just say "hey we're working on new stuff!" and generate some hype?
---
That's the story they served to everyone yes...
---
What was them "giving the middle finger to gw1 players"?
---
There's a possibility ArenaNet will go bankrupt tomorrow for unexplained reasons and all GW servers (both 1 and 2) get shut down immediately.
---
But does that make a possibility of it happening likely?
---
Now to answer a question that isn't as far up in the air as the stratosphere:
---
&gt; why are they taking so long? 
---
WvW was based off of servers. Changing this to reflect guilds and alliances instead is a significant change. Not just because they're changing what WvW is based off of, which is no doubt the more significant portion of the work, but because they have to create a new system (alliances) from scratch. And I doubt it's just these two things that they need to do to make the alliance system work - from what I recall, I believe the last draft we saw indicated a number balance among players as well between "teams" and that the teams will reshape every match - so not only are we replacing servers for alliances, but the matching of allied alliances change every time as well as who you fight.
---
This is a *lot* of work to do, and GW2 is full of spagetti code - especially stuff from early development, which includes the very foundation of WvW which the alliance system will be altering completely. And from the sound of it, they announced this decision *before they began working on it*.
---
&gt;GW2 is a niche game that focuses more on its cash shop than it does actually making everything else fun or replayable.
---
Even then the cash shop compared to most other games that rely on MTX like PoE..is shit. Nothing in the store has this eye popping effect that makes me think..I need this. If they really wanted to make money then they should copy POE's MTX store to the T.
---
Are we reading different threads? All the replies I see are more along the lines of "give up all hope, ye who play dead game."
---
Wait so you're saying you think sony builds a playstation, and then sells it for less money than it costs them to manufacture it?
---

---
gud
---
Trash skins.
---
Trash skins. No one uses them. I don’t see anyone with these skins.
---
Zerg or no zerg reward track rates are the same.
---
That’s not crying, that’s laughing!
---
Pretty sure you can still play
---
I mean, at this point OP is on the side of circlejerk, so they are safe to post it. :)
---
my gpu crashed after seeing the screen
---
This statement makes me laugh (in a good way). I think back to  a time when you would've been showered in abuse in this subreddit for even suggesting that the Devil (tm) should lay its fingers on the golden angel that came down from heaven.
---
Anet really turned a lot of fans around, quite surprising.
---
You can but it's just not the same anymore
---
The feels.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7GD9asBtA8&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
Yup, and she shouldn’t have been fired. Companies should back their employees’ right to say what they want on their own time.
---
Peter was being perfectly reasonable. Come at me, immature reddit users.
---
its coming May 2020 its call "NEW World" allaince.  joke aside u have to be dumb to even think they are working on alliance they are all too busy working on side projects.  Alliance aint going to help GW2 bring in more profit anyway. Game is on maintenance mode they can barely even put out living story.
---
How?  My early 2015 MacBook Pro runs it on high settings...
---
Thanks. I only make the DPS food but I can see the preview issue as a problem.
---
One can only hope. 
---
See this is why Anet should announce stuff instead of letting people's speculations spiral out of control.
---
Both Microsoft and Sony do it. They buy the hardware in bulk (so they get it discounted) and then sell it even cheaper to the consumer. This gets the user into the eco system. Microsoft and Sony then make their profit from the games and the subscriptions.
---
hmm ok, if i buy the expansion now, will my leveling experience change dramatically?
---
Going back and not being able to jump is really weird to me.
---
oooooh ty
---
Don't you have to own HoT to buy LS3 and PoF to buy LS4/LS5? There are a lot of story start points that are in HoT/PoF zones between the two
---
Pretty sure Sony does it too. Sony’s main trade is insurance if I remember correctly, with the computer hardware business being a secondary income stream. They have the resources to do the same strategy as Microsoft.
---
I just checked one of my core-accounts which also gathered some unbound magic from the home instance, it's not shown in the wallet but according to efficiency  - [https://gw2efficiency.com/account/wallet](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/wallet) \- it's there. So I guess it is just hidden in the wallet as long as you can't use it.
---
It's horrible. I hit space and I start running in a random direction lol. I actually had to unbind that key
---
&gt; A new IP is a lot of work
---
True, though I wouldn't be so quick to assume it'll be a totally new IP. Even if it went the route of, say, Overwatch, where the lore is secondary to the gameplay, they'd probably try to find a way to keep their existing Guild Wars lore pool relevant to keep the existing fanbase interested.
---
At least, that would be one option.
---
interesting! Thanks for that! I might just end up picking up the expansions anyways.
---
I dunno, I get like 30-40 fps in raids, which is all I really care about...  When I used to do things like world bosses, etc, I was still playing on my PC—but now I live in the aerodome anyways.  Agreed I would have to turn down the settings though if I wanted to do a bounty zerg or something.  
---
I think the optimization is interesting with GW2...  (probably not in a good way).  But it runs pretty good on terrible machines—and then not much better on awesome ones.  It’s honestly weird...  FF14 or ESO won’t even let you install the game on a 2015macbook cuz the graphics hardware is so bad, but gw2 is like whatever.
---
Snow globe infusion
---
Servers only matter for WvW which should be fairly obvious if you want to play with someone that you should be on the same server.
---
If you're wanting to PvE, it doesn't matter what server you're on unless you cross region (NA versus EU).
---
Also, don't worry about creating a support ticket to try and get on her server.  Anet doesn't move people to full servers.
---
At this point, I just wanna see that studio go down with its management headfirst. 
---
Will definitely give me an excuse to start actively looking for another game.
---
#FuckEAnet add us to r/freefolk
---
Judging by the time of your post, I'm presuming you played well before primetime.  It's also the end of the matchup right before reset, and many people are on holiday. 
---
Don't get me wrong, WvW population is much lower than it used to be, but you most likely just didn't play at an ideal time.
---
The base game took 5 years to make. So after 6 years, it would be reasonable to see the content doubled. Which in many aspects it hasn't.
---
I always assumed the fractals and such were mostly done during the base game's development.
---
I'd also like to add: If Anet ever releases their "Alliance"-system for WvW, the teams will be guild based, not server based anymore (Though I doubt they'll release it in the  foreseeable future).
---
yikes...YIKES!
---
What a snowflake.
---
well only like 10% is gemstore.  and also whats bad at having low cost gemstore items?
---
This reminds me so much of ren &amp; stimpy animation and i love it (but also not to detract from your style it's just so fluid and fun to look at)
---
You're already in your mindset.  Why are you asking?  
---
Nothing anyone will say is gonna change you.    
---
There's valid points that can be made for both sides of this.  
---
Bye with the title bait
---
Play if you have fun. Find something else if you don't.
---
It's pretty clear ANet keeps making content for the game, as clear as that new content won't be equally liked by everyone, and that it won't focus on the things each and every player likes. 
---
If the new stuff isn't for you, you can voice it by not playing, not spending in the game, and by giving your feedback in the official forums.
---
But making the nth post like this in reddit is pointless.
---
Is it still profitable?  Yes.  Is there much to be had for a 30 dollar price point?  Definitely.  Can it be looked at as a game that has many things still to come for long time players?  No.
---
Looking at the past year it's hard to look at this as a game that is actively being developed.  The content they are pushing out is the smallest it's ever been.  Yes it may be coming more frequently but we are definitely getting less overall.
---
The Q1 forecast has been the death blow for my guild.  
---
We are currently looking at another game right now to move to.  A particular one that comes out in May 2020 where all the industry talent has been being poached too.
---
I’d say the story really had a great stopping point after killing Kralkatoric. It made sense, Aurene throws off the fate of becoming an all life destroying magic sucking dragon, gets rid of her dad and finds a way to synthesize or harmonize the different Magic’s that need to be consumed. The last cut scene with aurene flying off really felt like the end. But Anet had nothing else to actually give to people. No new game to announce, no way to pivot. And NCSoft was probably not okay with them going for 2-3+ years of maintenance mode for GW2 just to be able to release whatever they had next. So maybe they would have picked up with the jormag stuff in a new game but couldn’t and so now they’re trying to salvage what they can while still getting something other than GW2 up off the ground before any remaining goodwill dries up.
---
Wait what? Can you elaborate more on the protagonist from Oblivion becoming a villain?
---
I thought they &gt;!became Sheogorath!&lt;
---
Yes, and that's the reason why gw2 is nearing maintenance mode as explained by Deroir on this [clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/WildSnappyGoblinSSSsss)
---
HOT at release cost 50 dollars. Almost as much as a full price game. For that it had 4 zones with less than the size of Kryta; a 2 hour story padded to 5+ hours with mastery grind, with cut corners and loose ends everywhere; almost no exploration at all; grind, grind and more grind - grind keys, grind currencies, grind materials, and when you're done grinding somewhere in the far future you might get a new weapon skin as a reward.
---
And don't forget how they originally weren't going to give HOT buyers a character slot so you couldn't even play Revenant without buying a slot yourself.
---
Bad bot.
---
This's how I see every character with more than one infusion.
---
Ignore. 90% of people that make these shitposts haven't played the game in months/years and simply have no lives so they spend their time here posting the same crap over and over.
---
can't fight against what you can't see!
---
I can confirm WvW can be salty, but even there, it’s still not as bad as here.
---
Kotaku is not really reliable though
---
Let's they are doing the bare minimum to milk as much money as possible till they finally abandon it for new games.
---
The usual 'why take resources for rehashing past content when they can use these resources for new content' argument gets thrown a lot around here every time Season One is mentioned. Not everyone wants to win in GW2 the very same skins they won in GW1.
---
On the other hand, monetization makes very easy to justify putting in the effort to bring them in the game anyway.
---
So we get new skins for participating in the events and old skins in the Gem Store for those who want to parade with their favorite skin of yore.
---
Unreal Engine sounds fine if they keep to the instanced zone design of GW2. PuBG's maps are bigger and have more going on in them than a single GW2 zone.
---
But having loading screens between zones in a post-2020 game would be a major disappointment for me. We have games with planetary scales nowadays.
---
&gt;Are they hiring new people specifically for this new project or have GW2 devs been moved yet again to work on a new project?
---
The answer to this should be obvious once you see how ridiculously short Episode 1 was.
---
Which game?
---
The real question will ultimately be if this is GW related or not.
---
Yup, exactly why Anet's resources are going into an "unannounced" title!
---
Are you sure about that?
---
They made a fuss about the arsenal used for the new equipment templates and how any code which affects inventory space is a BIG concern. That was apparently one of the biggest issues with setting up the build templates (which goes to waste for legendary gears anyways but hngh rant doesn't go here).
---
Shared inventory space is part of that no-no zone of inventory. It might not be so simple to just add in more slots for one reason or another. Either way, at least in this case there's more than enough available for practical usage.
---
Daedric Princes can be considered antagonists.
---
&gt;FF14 had to shut down completely, go through a massive overhaul, and then have a laser focus on a very specific demographic that was being ignored by the people at blizzard to appease casuals
---
They started to do things MORE LIKE Blizzard, not the opposite. 
---
The original gameplay and design was more akin to an updated FFXI.
---
Adobe Illustrator :)
---
Joko also revised a lot of Elona's history, so it might be hard to figure out exactly what happened in Elona during Night Fall from an in-lore perspective.
---
Yep I was just making sure I understood what they were saying. Although I'm not sure how this makes my statement of being able to build an on par computer for the same price false.
---
&gt;PoF definitely eclipsed HoT in positive retrieval, largely due to the innovative mount system, imo.
---
Nope. Not at all.
---
&gt;I think you forgot to say "in your opinion"
---
;)
---
Sad thing is. Jumping puzzles are so annoying for me. But they have gotten better now that I can go first person. The depth of field for jumping puzzles and under water really mess with me. Plus I'm content in gw1 was harder than gw2 for me as well lol
---
&gt;People tend to forget how annoying navigating HoT maps
---
No one forgets that, people STILL mention it to this day and actively tell new players to get PoF first solely to get mounts.
---
&gt;Had they done that the game would've been dead years ago.
---
How? It was that very concept that brought people to GW1 and 2 in the first place.
---
its safe to assume there will be frequent content updates at least until the saga is over in 18 months or so
---
And it's shorter than the PROLOGUE.
---
They've delivered nothing and now they're trying to find devs for a completely different game.
---
I was looking to make sure someone pointed this out too lol
---
&gt; As you said, without priority...
---
as I mentioned :P
---
All games die at own point and for that anet needs a snd game. And i hope they will make own then i like to see more art like games with intressting lore and more things to explore from that company.
---
It's not even the content for me. I sometimes log in, look at my characters, and feel like they're finished. I love them, but I have no ambition to continue them. They're done the way they are. And i can't fault anet for this, I think I'm just burnt out.
---
I think combat would become garbage. Would go from 10 skills to maybe 3 or 4
---
How can you possibly buy equivalent components cheaper than you can from Sony when they’re selling the components cheaper than the manufacturers are selling them for? If you could, Sony would be buying them even cheaper.
---
&gt;the game gets updated pretty regularly.
---
For a MOBA or FPS, maybe. For an MMO, no. And although the updates are released somewhat regularly, the content in each one has dropped.
---
[http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PaABwqpjlNwEZdMOGJWqP/rVA-z5IOCuHA](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PaABwqpjlNwEZdMOGJWqP/rVA-z5IOCuHA)
---
Give this a shot.
---
Tbh I would pay Anet for them to port GW2 to an engine that doesn't run like complete ass... a console release would give them a reason to invest in it
---
It wasn't just the difficulty of HPs, of course. Anet, like most companies (and people, debatably), is reactionary and only sees extremes, no nuance or middle ground. So when people said, "we liked having challenging content and map-wide metas in HoT, but would also like a mix with some maps we could explore without worrying about events or challenging stuff," Anet heard, "no more challenging content or map-wide metas." So then they went full-speed in the opposite direction of HoT.
---
I fail to see the causality between a worrisome release and the certainty of every resource going into an "unannounced" title. And the causality between what I think of warclaw balance and your opinions suddenly becoming facts.
---
I could say 'have you seen the jewel that this Bjora Marches map is? It is the proof that ArenaNet is more diligent than ever in the quality its releases'. It wouldn't make much more sense though.
---
Long story short, why would you even correct others just to do the same mistake immediatly afterwards?
---
ok.
---
Blown out of proportion? Yes, for sure. But the criticism is still fair to me. A good roll on a reactor/engine is still soft gating the veil.
---
I play mainly for wvw. To me, this is no different than pubg or planetside. Just a different take. Any PvE stuff I do is purely so I can buy things for WvW. It's the same with sPvP. If you're in it for PvP of any kind, and aren't interested in the PvE side, why do you need rewards? That being said, I did farm down the skyscale and roller beetle, and am working on map complete because I dropped a dusk, but that's in the afternoon when I'm waiting for the crew to get on. 
---
If PvE is your main interest, I don't know what to tell you. I've never done a raid, I've barely done fractals, and I haven't even completed all the dungeons. \~1500 hours, 600 on thief.
---
Okay, what are the problems of wvw? Beside unbalanced server and unblanced class? Pls tell me, when i normally play a little wvw or whatch some wvw streams they are only talking about tjis both problems.

What do I think about it?
---
No! Completely unnecessary. That's what I think about it.
---
Waste of resource. That's what I think about it.

At any rate, I’m glad you decided to eat some downvotes for the greater good and spread some knowledge, cuz you can get some good deals out there...

I think a lot of people only consider new when they think about building a PC, and that’s not the only route—and especially if you’re willing to go a few gen’s back with your parts (which isn’t even THAT big of a deal), you can get something really decent for a reasonable chunk of cash.

People with different life experiences have different stories to tell. Maybe they're tired of the same kind of shit.

Nobody likes Pistol Dagger Condi but me. XD

That's why I keep saying, stop buying gems!
---
Indeed, citation needed on what you said.

You're trying to argue that the reason the games are known would also be the reason the game would've died years ago, as if the game didn't start to decline BECAUSE they decided to follow a normal MMO trend.
---
It's a bit naive to assume that a new game will change their terrible habit of fire-and-forget content releases, or that they will actually decide on a direction for the game.
---
No denying it was well written; it was just also a gut punch

simple... im not buying custom manufactured parts. I dont need a special motherboard that is made specifically for me, with the chips built in and made to fit into my custom made case, im buying mass produced consumer components, that have better price to performance.

No, this time they took one episode and divided into two different episodes.
---
Only if you play more often than every 2-3 months

With scourge heals, you should be full support or gtfo.

Thanks for not hating me like everyone else. I'm trying my best.

Tahlkora was fully awakened, not partially... unfortunately for Joko, he was unable to control her like he controlled all his other Awakened (even Koss), due to Kormir's protection.  That's why he unravelled the magic he used to awaken her and left her in the state she's in when found in the griffon roost.

My bad, it is my opinion that the current "Saga" format is lack luster, the story is boring, and the game is boring unless you are playing Core. It is also my opinion that this is a common tactic in this sub Reddit, start talking about random stuff until the OP forgets to spell out that what they are saying is their opinion.  You got me!! GG!!

If you want to talk fact, we can do that as well. You may be happy with the dwindling content and recycled festivals but many, many, many people are not. That is why Minecraft streamers can pull more views than the official GW2 channel on Twitch. That is also why most, but not all, of the GW2 content creators have moved on to other games. It is also a lilely that there is literally no talk of GW2 or hell even Arenanet outside of the community unless there is major drama. Those are facts, like it or not. I'll read whatever you post next but this is my last response so post what you want and you can call it a win if it makes you feel good.

Says something when people are already tired of it after one episode, I feel.

Dumb idea
