That's why I keep saying, stop buying gems!

Indeed, citation needed on what you said.

---
You're trying to argue that the reason the games are known would also be the reason the game would've died years ago, as if the game didn't start to decline BECAUSE they decided to follow a normal MMO trend.
---
It's a bit naive to assume that a new game will change their terrible habit of fire-and-forget content releases, or that they will actually decide on a direction for the game.
---
No denying it was well written; it was just also a gut punch
---
simple... im not buying custom manufactured parts. I dont need a special motherboard that is made specifically for me, with the chips built in and made to fit into my custom made case, im buying mass produced consumer components, that have better price to performance.

No, this time they took one episode and divided into two different episodes.

Only if you play more often than every 2-3 months

Tahlkora was fully awakened, not partially... unfortunately for Joko, he was unable to control her like he controlled all his other Awakened (even Koss), due to Kormir's protection.  That's why he unravelled the magic he used to awaken her and left her in the state she's in when found in the griffon roost.
---
My bad, it is my opinion that the current "Saga" format is lack luster, the story is boring, and the game is boring unless you are playing Core. It is also my opinion that this is a common tactic in this sub Reddit, start talking about random stuff until the OP forgets to spell out that what they are saying is their opinion.  You got me!! GG!!
---
If you want to talk fact, we can do that as well. You may be happy with the dwindling content and recycled festivals but many, many, many people are not. That is why Minecraft streamers can pull more views than the official GW2 channel on Twitch. That is also why most, but not all, of the GW2 content creators have moved on to other games. It is also a lilely that there is literally no talk of GW2 or hell even Arenanet outside of the community unless there is major drama. Those are facts, like it or not. I'll read whatever you post next but this is my last response so post what you want and you can call it a win if it makes you feel good.
---
Says something when people are already tired of it after one episode, I feel.
---
Dumb idea
---
Never said it was shit, never said it was horrible.   The game is what it is and I got more than my money out of it and made some amazing friends/memories in the process.   I even stated that it's perfectly fine that I feel the game is no longer made for me.   I'm genuinely not angry about the time I spent in GW2.  That does not absolve Anet of their terrible ass decision making, however, or my dislike of the direction they ultimately went in.  I still feel its the best combat system in the MMO genre.   Still feel they have some of the best artists in gaming.   Those people are not the issue.
---
Let us hope that this is the end of gw2.  They have let us down. And it's time for them to take a step back and start over.
---
Thank you!
---
but why male models?
---
&gt;the new masteries are expansion level features.

---
&gt; I'm really happy with the state of wvw right now,  
---
Ok white knight.
---
&gt;90% of people that make these shitposts haven't played the game in months/years
---
Here we go, the idiotic white knights, as usual, trying to say everyone complaining is wrong and has no life and everything is perfectly fine.
---
&gt;Indeed, citation needed on what you said.
---
I don't need one, the fact that ArenaNet prioritises PvE/LW is proof enough that the playerbase for those modes is unsustainable and not worth bothering with. Because they sure as hell wouldn't bother going to all the effort of developing PvE/LW content if there was a cheap'n'easy (WvW/PvP) option.
---
&gt;You're trying to argue that the reason the games are known would also be the reason the game would've died years ago, as if the game didn't start to decline BECAUSE they decided to follow a normal MMO trend.
---
No, because for that to be my argument I'd have to actually think that PvP/WvW had anything to do with what made the game popular. Which is utterly laughable.
---
What happened to the focus being on GW2 and with sagas having expansion level content? It sounds like the only expansion level content about to happen is digging the grave deeper so that GW2 will fit next to Wildstar and CoH

10/18 armor pieces on the list are gemstore
---
10/10 armors/skills now outfits are gemstore
---
39/127 weapons are gemstore. 
---
on top of all of that the gemstore stuff is almost always higher quality/more effects than the in game obtainable items on that list.
---
that's not 10%. its amazing how brainwashed anet has made their players.
---
Well, ArenaNet praises itself as innovators, revolutionizing industry standards, it's literally their job to find out.
---
There's a metric shit ton of mechanics and gameplay flow to design within horizontal progression, they just didn't.
---
Like, a basic example would be to design 10-ish capes (it's literally a 2d plane with physics) and give them as a dungeon reward. That'd revitalize dungeons for like half a year. 
---
But all we got was a minimum viable product free (guild cape) to introduce the feature, and the rest in the gem store with artificial scarcity and a timer to trigger fear of missing out.

Well I don’t know what to think about this post, it probably takes 5 minutes on YouTube to find a better speed run of this JP with better/riskier shortcuts without cutting the video in the middle (rng part but still part of the run) made already few years ago.
---
Did some more speedrunning today and yes it is possible! I found out that it's only possible at a specific spot only. But it really doesn't shorten the lenght of the run, only if you get super lucky with the mini snowballs which fall from the sky since those are a huge factor on how you'r run goes. Thank you for you'r comment :).
---
Thanks for testing! By the time the snowballs are coming I‘m already so close to the finish line that shaving one second off doesn’t seem worth the risk of trying
---
It sounds like you're really enjoying PoE and not that GW2 is a bad game.
---
It's normal for aging games to draw in less players over time. It's also normal for different games to have different types of player engagement. Games like PoE are designed to be incredibly repetitive, do the same things over and over with slight variations in build, or even the same build with different loot. Guild Wars 2 and PoE don't compete in this way, they are different games that intend to engage players in different ways.
---
Some of GW2's focus over the years has moved away from engaging the repetitive content players and more towards the one and done exploration/story based content. A lot of people who were engaged by dungeons and fractals have, unsurprisingly, struggled with that change. The business model (and thus the gear model) of GW2 was never built well for a loot grind style of gaming (most veterans had max gear in 2013) and so content was always going to be less grindable in GW2 than in games which do have more of a focus there.
---
I also have no idea but they swear by it
---
Well, you're welcome to your opinion.
---
No game in mantenance mode records more voices for story, and there's no way they have already recorded all the voices for S5 when they've shown they are not sure about what's going to happen in a chapter until a few months before its release.
---
If the 'saga' was like side stories, just text with no voices, that could be 'maintenance' like when they did Guild Wars Beyond for GW after they started work in GW2.
---
Ah, right. I totally forgot about the whole price point issue at the time. Yes, that caused a lot of strife. Yes, the first patch really made all the difference. I'll be perfectly honest, I have over 4k hours logged in GW2, but I've never actually played all of the HoT story.
---
Nope, those were developed after release, as was everything else that came out afterwards, including Ascended stuff...but that's all I can say about that.

&gt; There's only so much kicking a dog can take before it bites.
---
The lack of self awareness is incredible. No-one is kicking a dog, in no way is that an appropriate metaphor for anything that has happened to the GW2 community. Not getting a new fractal in a year is not even close to someone kicking a dog, not getting a new raid in half a year is not even close to someone kicking a dog, not getting an expansion since PoF is not kicking a dog.
---
ArenaNet sold us a good game. It came with a lot of content, the same with its expansions. They release several updates a year, free of charge beyond the expansion purchase, with a lot of content that a single player game would charge for in some form. Its paid for by the cash shop, which primarily sells cosmetics or convenience items.
---
In the past we got more of some things than we get of them these days, but no-one is being kicked or mistreated. You may not be happy with the state of how things are because you wanted more, but you are not a victim and ArenaNet aren't abusing the community. It's absurd people talk like this and it undermines any genuine points you do have to make.
---
Oh ok then :) İ am new to this but it seemed logical to me as you need more tickets and stuff but İ mean there can always be skins that nobody likes right?

Go to Salma District, hop over the home instance wall. And be amazed at what you're reading. People dont talk to other like they do in emote chat

current meta is to hop from korean mmo to korean mmo while bitching on discord about how shitty they are all.
---
You can force a dismount by doing damage (10K hit points I think but could be way off) or with a mount skill that you get by making out rank points in the mount trait.
---
Roaming is still a thing.
---
Swiftness does boost mount speed but you can't cast while mounted.  Swiftness is still a thing but much much less.
---
Really just looking for a new game to play, don't really know how feasible GW2 is without a group though. Unless, I want to look more for a solo-world experience.
---
Plenty of people playing so no trouble finding groups. If you're on a US server and you want me to help you learn the basics, you can hit me up in game on Vayne.8563. Always happy to help a returning player.
---
&gt; It is a 100% fact 
---
I'm curious how you could prove that?
---
Thanks man! Will add you when I get on next.
---
What is "open world"? I know what is an open world map but I'm asking more as why do people refer to it as gameplay type? And what do they mean by it? Why are there "open world builds"?
---
A quick rundown of what are the other gameplay types would be helpful too, I just started today and I'm looking around trying to figure out which class to choose but I don't know any of the terminology.
---
Cpu. Pretty sure GW2 doesn't even use my graphics card.
---
I think that's the idea. Why admit to giving up and lose players instantly, when they can keep feeding them lies and lose them gradually. Same fate awaits every gamemode of GW2, some sooner than others. This is why customers will never get clear communication from developers/publishers, no matter how much they ask for it: it's in their best interest to keep you playing the game for as long as possible, with the tiniest glimmer of hope - they don't have an karma meter to fill, they won't be punished for not living up for someone's hopes and dreams, but they will gain in game population and in chance of them spending money on MTX or at least influencing gem conversion rates in GW2's case.
---
Uploading a new one right now with 1:08 time, clean run no cuts :).
---
After some backlash/hate on my previous run which i totally understand i wanted to try to get a clean run and beat my previous record. And yes i know you can dodge through the big snowballs, but on this run it didn't save any time and it afaik it can only be done at a specific spot. Also i'm aware of the skip at the 5th snowflake which i tried multiple times and it barely made any difference in time. Thanks for watching.
---
I've been on reddit for a while. And what I posted isn't wrong.
---
So sorry I don't just ignore the spread of false information.
---
Meta is firebrand healing, scrappers cleansing condis, off healing, stealth, revs doing CoR/damage, scourges rolling their face over their keyboard to do damage with shades/wells.
---
Add in some staff eles, spellbreaker domes and you got yourself a zerg
---
You must be the kind of person who thinks DLCs start being developed only after the game ships, and are totally not pre-planned years in advance.
---
That's not how game development works. At final stages before release (which can span for several months, if devs are lucky and not rushed), when the game is being tested, polished and bugfixed, content developers are already well into creating the first updates and DLCs, while publishers are rehearsing their press releases about 10 years of post-launch support.
---
what kind of a meme answers is that?!
---
which korean mmo btw?
---
PvD?  Player vs Devs? What's that suppose to mean?
---
Also, my server's yak bend and it's still quite populated.
---
Rightfully. I wonder if you are still defending the game to the death though lol.
---
stick with tempest for healing, they're welcome in almost every group and both out-heal and out-cleanse firebrand. firebrand is more for aegis and stab than anything
---
Of those 200 - 250 employees, you can probably take anywhere from 75 - 100 out as being actual developers of content since you have all of the support positions, QA and others that have nothing to do with development.  So if they have 4 teams, even if each team consists of 30 - 40 people, that's still to many people.  So take total employment down to around 200, 4 teams of 30 leaves 80 for all other functions...that sounds more like it.
---
Then there's me, who used to open a lot of BLC back when they were filled with the one-time versions of the bank/merchant/trade post items. I still haven't run out of them, and I've been playing since launch.
---
Well... Support-Ele and Support-War are actually viable specs right now in WvW so they are not really gutted.
---
I'm still sad that it won't stack with outfits. 😭
---
2080 ti and still 50 fps in LA. Can confirm.

"Living" by the way, our actions have no impact whatsoever in those time frozen maps.

So uhh you've become one of us (vets who attempted to take this game seriously). Either playing this game braindead and helping out casuals to have fun or.. moved on to a diff game
---
If the only concern for my ele is damage and heal, then I'll be fine. I've never heard that term, but my build is exactly what you described as scrapper boon cleanse. so it would seems it is still meta.

It already happened, just got renamed: [Alliances Are Here!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagoning)
---
... but in all seriousness, with entire guilds jumping servers every re-link, Anet is bringing in profits from the xfers. Players that don't transfer, end up making alt accts, which eventually spend money. We end up with a toxic cycle of troll accounts, shrinking guilds, and long-term players eventually calling it quits. 
---
On the plus side - there's a growing cross-server comradery where instead of nameless enemies, we have friends and 'neighbors' that we have previously played with, which leads to some fun fights.
---
I have doubts Alliances will launch. Too few devs, too many things to break, and a huge push to monetize every little thing. The current "Alliances With Extra Steps" model is already bringing in money and metrics, even if it's loosing players.
---
If you like WvW, don't overthink it, jump in and have fun!

Tempest is absolutely excellent in condi clears. If trained appropriately you can out cleanse many scrappers. Ez

Whether it's fine or not depends on the person. For me, I'm fine with them working on something else with the amount of focus Guild Wars 2 currently receives.

Not really. You're saying with complete certainty that this game will never be as good as it was, when it's ALWAYS been controversial in how it handled updates and features. Yes, there's a lot to be concerned with right now, and they've lost a lot of truly amazing talent, but there's no way you can claim that this is for-sure bad for the game. While things may not have been super exciting lately, they're improving in a lot of ways too - like development transparency and actually working on balance. I'm not giving them a pass, but it's possible that those rose-tinted glasses may be skewing your view of how things were compared to how they are or even can ultimately be.
---
Head and shoulders could fix that.
---
Scrapper is one of engi's elite specs.
---
Is it irony when you're on here and part of the example I listed?  Appearance-wise, your asura fits the description.
---
You'd get fairly minor spoilers doing the first episode of Path of Fire which would unlock masteries. Pretty much no more than you're read on the box in the store.
---
I think I still have all my copies on my shelf. I used to run 3 accounts concurrently.
---
Why?
---
Lol i already did that. I have 2 items left
---
Holosmith uses a sword/shield. The lightsaber is just a skin.  
---
I'm also pretty sure dps chrono uses sword/sword, support chrono is the one running sword/shield.  
---
The question of finding groups depend on the role you want to fill and the build. In instanced content there are roughly three main roles - dps(condi or power), boon support, healer. And in a few raid bosses - tank, hand kiter. 
---
The viability of builds depends on the current meta and the content.  
---
Chrono can be a boon support or a pdps.  
---
Holo is a pdps or cdps.  
---
When you reach instanced content you **will** have multiple classes/builds, so don't worry too much on what you are going to do with your first toon.
---
That's a lot of additional work that will also cause more balance issues in the future. Not worth it.
---
ok please tweet elon musk he handles these things
---
They really should have just replaced legendary weapons with elite spec unlocks in season 5. I have absolutely no idea what the balance team spent the last two years doing to not even have ONE spec ready to go for the brand new expansion substitute season.
---
Odd, the total lack of player traffic made it look like everyone but me had had an update installed. 
---
Oh well. If that's the case, will be deleting this pointless thread
---
Wtf are you talking about? Most MOBAs get updated once a month, sometimes as fast as bi-weekly. GW2 is absolutely glacial by comparison.
---
guild based alliances coming when theres barely any active guilds left? way too late for that, i think even anet realizes how thats gonna end.
---
It shouldn't be a problem, as mentioned above FFXIV has much more shortcuts and it's manageable.
---
For GW2, I'd say that you could use the 8 top buttons of the pad with the front buttons as modifiers (for example: X, trigger1+X, trigger2+X,...): which is similar to a good keyboard setup of keys + modifiers (eg: Ctrl+E).
---
That wouldn't solve the problem Alliances were meant to solve. At the time they announced them (20-some months ago), North America WvW had one server that had taken first place for the region every week for about 20 weeks solid (and would do so for about another 20 weeks). This coincided with ANet adding skirmish rewards to WvW. The increased reward structure seems to have messed with game balance.
---
They acknowledged that problem in the restructuring announcement: "For example in NA, Blackgate has decent coverage across all time zones whereas worlds like Crystal Desert have higher peak times and lower off-hour times. Because world linking isn't granular enough, we don't have the ideal link that allows Crystal Desert to have coverage that is similar to Blackgate."
---
As I read this, the only practical way they could balance for coverage was to remove people from the juggernaut server/servers.
---
[removed]
---
Me? Nope, mat trading.
---
Its the nature of any industry if they dont have the work then there will be layoffs they hired people to do the work the work fell through and then they have to lay people off if they didn't then more project's will suffer the same end if they didnt take the risk with a new project then the company will not progress and make more money to fund newer projects. That is why a conservative government which trys to keep the status quo and keep things the same will always fail as you need progress in order to keep a country afloat or in this case a company
---
I was asking RMT gold is. Hadn’t heard the term before.
---
&gt;It's increasingly being neglected and hemorrhaging thier hardcore players. Anet's strategy seems to be a revolving door player base where they attract new players and hope they buy things on thier way out. Doing the bare minimum needed to give, what loyal fans it does have left, a basis to argue the game is not in maintenance mode.
---
Here's a real issue I have with the subreddit community. They assume that if *they* are less interested in the game, that *all* veteran players are, and that the *only* people currently enjoying the game are "new players who haven't already done everything." 
---
Nonsense. 
---
Veteran players still love the game, they are just veteran players with different interests than the whiners. A lack of new Fractal or Raid content is a *good thing* for players who never did the previous Fractal and Raid content, which was *most veteran players.* 
---
I'm ok with players expressing why they aren't enjoying the game, so long as they don't try to put on airs about it, pretending that their viewpoints are somehow more evolved than those that disagree with them.
---
What about Dragon Fall? I thought that was one of the best maps they'd done.
---
Because Guild Wars 2 is also good for Veteran players. It's far and away the best MMO on the market overall.
---
You keep using words that do not mean what I think you think they mean. This game had TONS of content for veteran, hardcore players. It just didn't have a lot of content for dungeon runners, and that was fine, because the game never needed dungeon runners, and those players could play something else instead. ANet made some attempts to pick up the spare, but it wasn't worth the effort.
---
Because it's an MMO. What is more MMO than a world boss that you can tackle with a massive amount of players?
---
Real Money Trader gold.
---
There are threads up about how people have been banned for receiving gold attached to messages that was linked to third-party RMT.
---
Ah. Thanks for clarifying.
---
It really isn't.
---
Do you have a lot of use for the Saga masteries outside the two latest maps?
---
And looks like crap.
---
Scrapping content and putting the game in maintenance mode to work on GW2
---
all of these statements are true. game actually uses spaghetti code.
---
You got an upvote just for the intro that made me laugh a lot already :)
---
It really is. It can't be all things to all people, it certainly will never be the game that raid-type players will want, but that's ok, because they have WoW. GW2 is the festivus for the restofus.
---
Ok, but that's sort of how LW maps are meant to work, they last until the next map comes out, then people switch to that map. They aren't meant to last forever.
---
With feelings.
---
GW2 still runs on the old (yet very reworked) GW1 engine from 2005 so I would hope they go with a new one.
---
Appreciate it, glad you enjoyed it!
---
You basically [salvage](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Salvaging) things you aren't going to use with the proper kits to get the materials from them. I'd just suggest using the correct salvage kits and checking on exotics before you salvage (unless you need the skin in which case I usually don't sell).
---
You didn't state that it was the best MMO overall for **you**, you said it was the best MMO overall fullstop.
---
Eh, but they're trying to solve it by basically allowing guilds to "bundle" into servers (and then adding up some of those bundles to form actual server).
---
However, people don't get locked into guilds like servers. So instead of shuffling between servers people start shuffling between guilds. I don't know if it would _really_ solve problem of N people banding together into Blackgate equivalent. It'll be simply BG Alliance between 2-3 wvw mega-guilds. And we'll be back to square one.
---
Alliances do allow attempted re-shuffling without switching home world by operating with one guild at a time "unit" (every player will only have _one_ "wvw" guild that will be used for "alliance" assignment). But again, it can also be accomplished by basically letting players to switch home world once in a while for free (at same cadence as home world re-shuffling).
---
Anyways, we'll see how it goes. I kinda expect we'll end up with EOTM-like model, because it's really hard to get comparable 24-hour coverage even if you have absolute freedom in how you pick players for particular "world" (alliance).
---
Maguuma is Tier 2 (rank 6 overall) you can check more details on sites like https://wvwstats.com/ but really the best way is to just hop into WvW yourself and see what guilds/commanders are running at the time you want to be playing.
---
&gt;Haven't seen anyone of those ever before tbh
---
[You just did not searched hard enough](https://i.imgur.com/goR81Bt.jpg)
---
There is no such thing "GW2". There's Guild Wars and a game that has stolen the the glorious name of the original one. Besides of some small easter eggs, famous names and the map this game has nothing to do with Guild Wars. 
---
Moving to GW2 they ditched a big ass expansion for Guild Wars. And nothing, literally nothing they promised for GW2 originally is there anymore. 
---
ANet made a great and profitable game. But they never made Guild Wars 2.
---
That's exactly where I was going with this. The only cross expansion content we've received from either expansion has been gliders, mounts, and specializations. If you measure an expansion on these 3 factors alone, it's an unfair judgement.
---
You mean you had à lot of time to study* ahah
---
But that is what expansion worthy additions are, new systems and not just small masteries. What we got so far is living story worthy additions, they need something bigger for it to be compareable to an expansion.
---
Yes, you're new, enjoy the game for what it may represent to a new player.
---
Yeah, you have been unbearable in Reddit too, that much we know
---
I'm Italian that's why I can have 80 fps at LA :D
---
Yeah, RS3 and just about every other MMO has been a huge disappointment in recent years, especially considering the revenue of some of companies (like Jagex) is hitting all-time highs
---
I'm on team Seiran, but they all have a story that makes the sacrafice they do meaningful:
---
* Seiran was curious and loved life, she wanted to see more of the world, wanted to live, go on adventures, find someone to love.
---
* Tybalt was defeated, we gave him a reason to carry on and redeem himself
---
* Forgal I don't know tbh never really paid attention
---
Snowball position matters too much :). Also i would lose time on it. Thanks for watching!
---
"You keep using words that do not mean what I think you think they mean." 
---
Little case of the pot calling the kettle black here bud. I mean seriously, what the actual heck? "The game never needed dungeon runners."?
---
Have you done drugs? The base vanilla game literally started out with ONLY dungeons as the end game. And you're telling us that the game never needed dungeon runners? What is wrong with you?
---
Maybe you should go back to the official forums where you can have your safe space to post nonsense like this. I think you'll quickly find out that blatantly incorrect statements like this on Reddit won't really survive in an environment where people are actually free to call you out on your total nonsense, and won't get their posts deleted doing so. Like honestly man, what the actual hell dude, holy shit.

It's like MMO Player Characters are blank slates by design for you to fill in the gaps, or something
---
WvW is dead.
---
Move along.
---
~~Furries.  That's (likely) why.~~
---
In all seriousness, though, the more plausible reason is that the super sleuthy, sneaky group was probably more appealing to more people so more people met Tybalt than the other two.
---
Ok?
---
Me too. Unfortunately they made garbage decisions like animation cancel and locking bars to 5 skills to accommodate a console gaming crowd (which is even worse because toggle skills like summons take up 2 slots effectively as they have to be individually kept at each bar).
---
The game was very enjoyable when I leveled in it, but the moment you make it to endgame and optimization involves tedious animation cancel garbage antics and skill builds scale poorly, the game falls off for me.
---
Especially with their atrocious decision on racials punishing you heavily for playing the race you like.
---
Tybalt, for me, was simple, relatable, and kind. I just couldn't relate to the old Norn and the Sylvari was just too weird for me.
---
Exactly this, or just the obscene amount of time it would take to farm the gold for that 1 item you sort of like
---
It was worth it 7 years ago when the game launched and exotic gear was hard to come by. You can easily buy a full set on trading post nowadays.
---
There is also a tradeable exotic medium armor set with those stats, called Nika's Armor, that costs around 10g for all 6 armor pieces.
---
Not sure, if you can purchase it as f2p. Just search "nika" on the tp and check it out.

Forgal lost his wife and children to Icebrood, which made him join the Vigil in the first place. He sees you not only as an apprentice/soldier, but also as his personal protegé, which he masks behind a gruff and stern façade. It's easy to mistake his particular way of caring for indifference or impatience, which is why I think some don't click with Forgal. 
---
Towards the end, the lines get a bit blurry, and you realize you are kind of becoming a spiritual replacement for what he lost, the closest and kindest social relationship he has had in a long time. There is a lot of mutual respect involved, and he is ultimately very, very proud of you. When he gives his life for you at Claw Island, he goes the way a Norn should go: fighting terrifying odds for an honorable purpose - to save your life and many more - and it falls to you to tell his story. 
---
"I lost my mate and children to the dragons. I thought my legend was buried with them, that I had no one to walk in my footsteps and tell my tale. Now that's changed, my friend. Thank you for being my legacy. Tell my tale at the hearth fires, where the skaalds sing of heroes. 
---
Go. I will not fail."
---
F2P doesn't allow using the Trading Post. Seems like Karma merchants in Orr are my best thing then. Thanks though.
---
Thank you.
---
Correct, usually good looking BL skins will triple or more their value after some time, average looking ones will not even double.
---
But do note that to have a good amount of profit per weapon you need to wait months maybe even years for them to start valuing more.
---
I disagree with the "someone will wait the entire 18 months for their spec" argument.
---
1. We all have access to play every class
---
2. You might find you like, say, necro new elite and start to main that one. Elite specs makes having a "main" pretty arbitrary.
---
3. You might hate your "mains" spec anyways. At least we get to be excited as to see what comes next over a long period of time, instead of a single burst when all 9 are released.
---
4. It's going to be WAY easier to balance 1 new spec at a time than 9.
---
Because you can't share it with mapchat, your guild AND reddit, right?...
---
lmao
---
Like your art, your comebacks aren't even clever
---
Seriously even when Chak Egg Sac dropped for me I didn’t make a post or ping it
---
probably in a box full of games..for like 10 quid for the box
---
Many thanks!
---
Nope
---
Where's all the morons claiming that "Oh, oh, ArenaNet's fault, let our savior NCSoft come and fix the mismanagement" now that it basically is under the full grasp of NCSoft and not just at its behest when NCSoft, say, forces art personnel to cowork with its Iron Tiger mobile development?
---
Damn, two in 1 week? Sounds like waaaaay too much T6 mat farming for me.
---
Is that your Pablo Escobar cosplay?
---
I wanted to name my character Luna because Luna is my waifu xd
---
In game screenshot followed by Gyazo. Probably the worst way to do it but many thanks.
---
If you aren't using d912pxy .. you could use the same filters on gw2hook if you have that still.
---
Idk man, I remember my hero Dervish had killed Abbadon, then went to Cantha to overthrow the Ministry of Purity and then fought against Charr in Ascalon.  
---
/s 
---
It's actually funny, because the Dunkoro talk is the same if u arent human anymore.
---
it's not actually a game breaking bug.. you just have to stop afking in pvp &gt;\_&gt; resapwn is available &gt;\_&gt;
---
this is why I ignore angry comments about anet being bad. if you take a look what other games  are doing. You clearly see that gw2 is not that bad. even ff14 has issues and massive ones, just that they have really good pve content currently. but their pvp is just terrible.
---
coming back on topic. wvw and pvp will get some balance changes really soon. anet finally started to talk about their future plans "somewhat" so thing going right direction.
---
HoT story was supposed to have a nightmare court arc to show how the nightmare court dealt with Mordremoth's influence, and us striking an uneasy truce/alliance with them ( this is why during the dragon's stand meta you can find a Nightmare court NPC on one of the islands, Duchess Chrysanthea, probably someone that took over/gained influence after what happened to Faolain). They also scrapped a piece of story that dealt with the fate of Malyck and his people ( optional personal story from the sylvari, Malyck was a Sylvari from a different tree than the Pale Tree, a mystery that was supposed to be dealt with in HoT but got scrapped).
---
My favorite after doing all Story with the 3 is Sieren. Was funny and a bit naive, but i miss her more than the other 2.
---
As a WvW commander: 6 types of superior siege, 4 types of guild siege, disablers, supply and painter traps, provisioner (and what the others said)
---
If you have testimonies of heroics stocked up from when you last played you can purchase the HP unlocks from a WvW vendor. PoF and HoT each give 10 points per completion.
---
&gt;but every espec eclipses core
---
Does core Warrior just straight up not exist in your world?
---
Yes this is a bug that's been happening the most on the Skyhammer map. For years. Yes, ANET is aware of it. No, they have not expressed any plans on fixing it. So we don't know when or if it will ever be fixed.
---
It is a strange thing that the first one feels so long and impossible, but then they just feel sort of normal and do-able after that. Congrats.
---
Youre panel 4, is what youre saying?
---
Don't really need any special effects or addons. Just special dyes. I got an extremely similar result using certain dyes (and of course lighting changes everything). Like 99% of the time nobody can even tell the difference unless you're just sitting in town staring at eachother lazily
---
I agree with everything you said, except for Guild Wars 2 trying to avoid grind. It's like the grindiest game I've ever played, man, how does it try to avoid grind?
---
[❤](https://apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/unicode#emoji-modal) true, very nice job and really sweet [❤](https://apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/unicode#emoji-modal)
---
that is less of a parasitic corruption and more of a symbiosis, tho it was still a BS unnecessary out of the blue twist with a lackluster explanation that only served to later convince us that aurene was truly dead (for a time), and was then later in war eternal used to flesh out a new redundant faction that has since then already fallen back into insignificance and nothingness again. just as a reminder: the commander already was her champion long before that point and aurene could communicate with us telepathically ever more comprehensively since the day she hatched.
---
 I suppose you could put the most important ones aim side (which isn't a big problem if the game has a good smart camera system).
---
Another good point for GW2 is that the only aspect of gameplay that is difficult with a controller in FF is healing (targetting allies is quite slow), but the combat and the fact that you don't have to target allies in GW2 is a great thing.
---
I'm not saying that a controller is better or even equal to keyboard + mouse (quite the opposite) but it is totally usable. I personally use a controller in FF when I do casual stuff (gathering, crafting, missions,...) so I don't have to sit at my desk. Something that I'd love to do in GW2 since it's an even more casual game.
---
The only thing that I'd consider a real issue is the usage of inventory items (like cc consumables for fractals that should be chained really quickly and that can't have a shortcut (barring AHK))
---
believe me, i'm more than aware, thank you for the concern though. even came up with a new word for it: *"contra*bution". mostly engaging with him to make it clear to others as well.
---
The balance of that map was incredibly broken on launch. One of the biggest reasons for that was the way channeling Mist Champions worked. They were so influential, but capturing them favored Necromancers way too heavily. Plenty of CC if you didn't have Stability, and plenty of Corruption if you did. On top of that, you could kite out a lot of 1v2s.
---
There was a bunch of stuff we could have abused in the streamed show matches, but we specifically chose builds to make it look fun. We didn't want to kill any hype for it by abusing stuff that we thought would get fixed. IIRC I played Berserker Staff Ele to defend from the wall.
---
Anyway, the point is that we had played it significantly at that point, since the show matches were after the public test weekend. We didn't like it. I'm sure most people would have given it a chance if they'd addressed some of the concerns we had. They'd specifically mentioned trying to get them done before launch. It turned out they just kind of gave up on it. *ArenaNet gave up on Stronghold before the players ever did.*
---
This. I am usually a diehard f2p-er, but getting the expansions for this game was such a game changer that I must recommend the purchase.
---
Just buy the snowball tonic lmao.
---
Princess Luna, I can recall two characters names Luna, and one of the is a cat XD
---
You are HC :D
---
I did take a year off though. Didn't have a PC, guess what game was installed first when I got a PC xD
---
Check out wvw. You can also find exotic gear with assorted stats for a discounted gold price with the currency of wvw.
---
I ended up spending my karma on that gear too back in my first year of playing.
---
And then Monstrum came to double down.
---
&gt; GW2 since it's an even more casual game
---
The combat is not, is it? And to take full advantage of its capabilities you can't compromise with the controls. That is the point I was trying to make.
---
There are advanced fighting techniques that I don't see how they could be done with a controller. Let's say something like starting to cast a long heavy skill, cancel mid-animation to bait the enemies to your location, turn around, blink to the top of some terrain and instantly look back and cast a different ground target skill from high ground just in the middle of the various enemies you baited. And you'd probably have to slot a stun-break and dodge in there if they managed to CC you while trying to pull that off. That requires an amount speed and accuracy and many simultaneous actions that a gamepad just won't give you.
---
Even if they try to make the combat similar to GW2, its depth and complexity will have to be lowered a lot to make it usable on a console. There won't be dozens of skills at our disposal.
---
Lets meet irl. I'll fist fight you over that post.
---
#NotWithMyTybalt
---
WTF? I thought you meant the whole name. How is using a _very_ common first name stealing? There are tons of fictional characters named Luna and I've also met tons of Lunas in the game. The name has literally been around for thousands of years. Nothing is preventing you from making another Luna. &gt;.&lt;
---
There were some threads last week which explained how to fix this, try searching for them.
---
Now that's a great run.
---
Is there anyway to adjust that? My LA is at like 40FPS and it drives me insane
---
remindme! 123 hours "so how was the gemstore update received?"
---
Then go, fuck off and play with a healrene, tempest or scrapper in fractal CMs.
---
And please take a video of that shitshow.
---
I'm playing this godforsaken game too long to not have tried those other meme specs, years ago with druids as the "heal" it was the same retarded approach to bring boonsupporters instead of a real healer.
---
Do it, I'm not giving a fuck - gimp yourself and your team with some weird ass builds.
---
Renegades juggle Kalla/Jalis/Ventari and cannot heal when their team is stunned, all Healing done requires your teammates to either go attack a Boss or walk into bullshit healing spheres and that shit got purged even from WoW because blizzard got it faster than arenanet how retarded that was. You have no on demand heal and are forced to use Harrier to get 100% Alac wich has less Healingpower compared to alternatives you can't use as renegade.
---
Stick to Diviner Alacrene, kid. At least there you only need Kalla/Jalis and don't struggle with your identity.
---
remindme! next tuesday 18:00 UTC "so how was that gemstore update received"

They are not fine. If you're not 2k + rank, the pip gain just makes you sad. On a loosing server, I'm ranked 430 or so, I earn 4 pips per 5 mins .. that equates to an hour to complete the first wood track that gives you shit. I could be earning 5 pips instead If I completed the last week's wood track. 
---
Meanwhile, every day, without the need to do anything prior, you can go into pvp and complete the same track in the same time roughly, for slightly better rewards. The difference is that the tracks dont reset weekly. And as you progress into the tracks, the rewards get insanely better, unlike the WvW ones. 
---
And if you do happen to be on a loosing server, you can forget the loot bags too. So you're left with the normal reward tracks which are not simply enough. 
---
I'm not even touching the fact that flipping tier 3 objectives, winning the skirmish or even the match, means nothing at all. All feels pointless.
---
Take a look at the top of this thread where the OP has made an edit, this seems to be working for everyone on a PC that is having this 35% hang issue -- https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/edudqh/game_downloads_to_35_then_seems_to_indefinitely/
---
They’re the primary force behind them. They even did interviews with Wooden Potatoes leasing ip to the release of PoF discussing them.
---
They are mostly only doing these boring outfits. I mean the concepts are good but if you could only use them as set it's boring. They should return to doing actual skins ..
---
I like skirts they are most comfy.
---
Whatever you say, kiddo.
---
&gt; Nonsense. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; A lack of new Fractal or Raid content is a *good thing*  for players who never did the previous Fractal and Raid content 
---
At best it is a "i don't care" thing, as I don't see why it *could* be a good thing if it doesn't affect you. Unless you mean that it'd mean less resources for other things, but Anet already proved you wrong if you were to raise this point :
---
Before : LS / Masteries / Legendaries / sometimes Raids / sometimes Fractals
---
Now : LS / Masteries / ...?
---
So yes, it is a good thing, it freed a lot of resources for them to work on... on what ?
---
Um... I was just kidding, you know?
---
Great job!
---
sad face..
---
are you that zoshin wvw commander? just asking
---
I'm trying to start working on leathercrafting (I'm level 40 currently) and I need a lot of lucent motes. From what I've read ,they should be dropping like flies from salvaging but I'm receiving almost none at all. I have like 10 total. Am I doing something wrong or are they more rare than they used to be?
---
The comment was specifically about their next game being on console and had nothing to do with whether or not the game would fail or if it was a good idea. I dont know it would or not and Anet is free to do the money what they will. I will hold my judgement until they show us what they are working on.
---
&gt;Let's say something like starting to cast a long heavy skill, cancel mid-animation to
---
There are even more rigorous similar mechanics in FFXIV (blip/slide casting).
---
But again, that's not the point, yes precision/speed is definitely subpar. But then what? You already have people with bad harware that can heavily affect gameplay. Are they "dumbing down" the game to the lowest common denominator? No.
---
Yes people can play the game in a 100x100 window at 5fps and 500ms latency, yes people can use an orbweaver's stick for movement, yes people can use a trackball mouse,... The game isn't "dumbed down" for them.
---
Yes people with worse hardware are at a disadvantage, in this case a controller, like in Fortnite or FFXIV. But at least they can play.
---
I'm a biased as I don't really care for any of the mentors and thought none of them were given enough characterization to actually matter, but Tybalt is quirky yet competent, which is an incredibly likable combination.  Basically, he's a meme character and I'm actually amazed people can write paragraphs about someone who's entire story can be summarized in a sentence.
---
&gt; At best it is a "i don't care" thing, as I don't see why it could be a good thing if it doesn't affect you.
---
Because everything created requires development resources. Time spent on content A reduces time available to spend on content B. The more they spend making raids and fractals, the less they have to spend developing open world content. Also, when they create cool skins, like Legendary armor, they lock them arbitrarily behind raids, rather than making them available to everyone else. And finally, raids tend to attract raiders, who think that their very presence is so absolutely vital to things that "the game is dying" if they aren't satisfied. And I just can't be bothered with their infantile nonsense.
---
So yes, it is a *very* good thing if they stop developing raids and fractals. 
---
&gt;So yes, it is a good thing, it freed a lot of resources for them to work on... on what ?
---
We won't know until the saga is over. By this point in HoT's timeline, they hadn't even released Bloodstone Fen yet. Are we supposed to be devastated that when they promised a season that would be equivalent to an expansion, that they didn't deliver an expansion within the first episode alone?
---
haha actually dungeon elitism existed cuz you'd waste more time failing than raids actually, 3 hours of wasted time yup.. this was again pre-elite specializations and power creeping.
---
Can F2P accounts not buy them on the Trading post? They are only a few coppers a piece.
---
Do add to this, if you are doing a power build (ie not worrying about condition damage), you want to get the armor from Grenth's cathedral in Cursed Shore. Each cathedral has a different set of stats, so you want to be careful of which you are getting.
---
As a side note, if you want more karma (for getting temple armor on other characters), there is currently a festival going on at Divinity's Reach that you can do an orphan run to make a ton of karma. Spend karma on toy weapon skins and wrapping paper, turn them into wrapped gifts, then hand said gifts to orphans for way more karma than you put in. You can give to each orphan once per day, and there's a total of 30 of them.
---
No, sorry.
---
then again, we had : an episode 0, an episode 1, and what to expect for at least episode 2 and near the 3rd. Also HoT WAS an expansion, not a LS.
---
So far, I see reduction in diversity of content provided, while seeing no improvement in the content provided. You seem to be eager to defend them, so I'd really know where those saved cost went.
---
#GOALS
---
&gt;haha actually dungeon elitism existed cuz you'd waste more time failing than raids actually, 3 hours of wasted time yup.. 
---
I never spent more than a few minutes failing at a dungeon. A dungeon run basically went 
---
1. run in head-first assuming everyone knew what they were doing,
---
2. Realize that players B and C did *not* know what they were doing, 
---
3. Explain to them how to do a useful role or at least stay out of the way.
---
4. Move to the next room.
---
They are if you like the skins.
---
You can get the same stats in many other ways, a few way cheaper than that.
---
But you won't find the skin anywhere else.

Everyone loves big derpy cats.

[Watergategate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vB9JgxhXW5w)
---
Each armor set (there are 6 merchants throughout Orr that sell the armor, each has different stats) comes with a set of runes, although the built-in runes are not necessarily ones that go well with the stats they come on. As an example, Grenth's has Berzerker (Power, Precision, Ferocity) stats, but has runes that give +Condition Damage and +Chill Duration.
---
&gt; then again, we had : an episode 0, an episode 1, and what to expect for at least episode 2 and near the 3rd. Also HoT WAS an expansion, not a LS.
---
But this is my point. The promised us an expansion over the course of a season. The season only just started, a prologue and one episode. I did not expect to get an expansion's worth of content by now, and in all truth, I would not *want* the "expansion-worthy" stuff by now. My hope is that this format allows them to spread out the releases more naturally, less limited by hard "this episode must contain X amount of stuff," or "since this is an expansion, everyone needs to be able to get new elite specs all at once and on the first day." I can't tell you that I'll love this season once it's done, but I can tell you that I don't hate it yet. 
---
&gt;So far, I see reduction in diversity of content provided, while seeing no improvement in the content provided. You seem to be eager to defend them, so I'd really know where those saved cost went.
---
I'd like to know too. It had to go someplace. We just haven't seen it yet. The only difference between us is patience.

He had the least typical missions, brought you to a drinking contests, did a boob joke, and looked like a samoyed/st bernand dog.

That's why people noticed him more.
---
&gt;It's like MMO Player Characters are blank slates by design for you to fill in the gaps, or something
---
It's like this is a SEQUEL and bothering to mention what happened with the previous character is a good idea.
---
Really using the fact this is an MMO to excuse shit writing. White Knights in a nutshell.
---
&gt;You don't know what they're doing behind the scenes
---
Do you?
---
&gt; you can't say that they haven't delivered anything, they're in the beginning of the season? 
---
Ah ok, so i'm supposed to think they'll deliver when the most important parts \[THE BEGINNING\] have been a mess.
---
&gt; It's so weird to me, I can't understand the thinking like this. 
---
Of course it's weird, you white knights will never understand anything that goes against "this company is flawless and always delivers" even when it's wrong.
---
This happened to me today in someones arena. The map was Skyhammer, fwiw. I hadn't played PvP in a while and was actually wondering if they'd added a respawn button somewhere and I was just missing it lol

From the wiki:

&gt;Salvaged from any Minor, Major or Superior rune or sigil.  
---
&gt;Salvaged from **Fine**, **Masterwork**, or **Rare** equipment with embedded runes or sigils when not using [Black Lion Salvage Kits](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Salvage_Kit). Rare gear or higher has a greater salvage rate.
---
Fuck that means it’s just after WvW alliances and world peace
---
Reddit people just want to criticize everything that's about Anet smh. I didn't say that the company is flawless, of course they don't get lots of stuff and had abandoned ideas before but this linear thinking of this reddit hivemind is just so tiring sometimes.
---
I agree alliances will not solve the problem. They are not difficult to manipulate and optimize using techniques wvw players already use.
---
They can try to avoid it with limits on the size of alliances and guilds, but those limits won't make -anyone- happy and won't solve the problem either.
---
Even more than that, they are an attempt to solve the wrong problem.
---
ANet believes the big wvw problem is balance of population and coverage. They are wrong.
---
The bigger problem is that wvw gameplay isn't very fun when you're losing because your opponent has enough players to win easily.
---
ANet can't force players to show up and compete as underdogs. They could add gameplay to make it fun for players to engage, even when the odds are bad.
---
My proposal won't happen, of course. ANet doesn't listen very well and is rigid about the problem being coverage. I don't think they can fix that when they can't force humans to choose to play.
---
Great run!
---
I tried to speedrun this myself, but could only do the first part consistently due to ping issues, just some tips if you're interested, but feel free to skip otherwise. 
---
You can jump on the first candy cane at 0:28, and dodge jump to skip the 2nd candy cane. This IMO is one of the biggest time saves, as it allows you to not have to let go of W the entire run, but is also the single hardest move to pull off, and I can't do it consistently even wirh practice. 
---
At 0:30, if you do a dodge jump, it gives you maybe a 0.2s time save and is really simple to do. 
---
The jump at 0:38 doesn't require a dodge jump to perform, and it can be used somewhere else for greater gains.
---
Have you checked if there's actually anyone on the guild? Maybe your guild died
---
Because that's literally what it was, the GW1 hero had absolutely zero personality and dialogue and the story was focused on the NPCs around them.  The same thing as literally every other MMO does allowing players to come up with their own characters and backstories and what not. The entire thing is that YOU decide how your toon is and their eventual fate.
---
Which reshade version are you using and did you install it as d12? Mine keeps crashing after configuring it ingame.

I've been having difficulty installing GW2 and I've tried numerous different fixes but none seem to be working for me.
---
Things I've tried:
---
Unchecked QoS Packet Scheduler  
---
IPv6 &amp; IPv4 are both checked  
---
Changed DNS to Google's  
---
Changed the target on GW2 shortcut to different addresses using -assetserv  
---
Changing the language on the launcher from EN to FR.
---
Everything I've tried, it seems when I first start the launcher, it works fine for a little, but then the download rate keeps fluctuating from 0kbps to 1-5MB/sec but the actual files remaining doesn't move.
---
The guild can't mute you, but you can most certainly mute your guild. Check the options / check boxes on the chat menu to make sure nothing got un-ticked. Could say something in guild chat then whisper a guildie to make sure chat's going through ok, they may be seeing it, just not responding to it.
---
Never seen anyone do 0:38 without a dodge jump, thanks for the tips!
---
have you tried relogging?
---
Also: what salvage kit should i use on my low lvl char?

Necro has always been meta in WvW. So I assume this "back then" is about dungeons or raids more than wvw (and pvp).
---
Well what I mean is like, levelling is super fast so you can get to the endgame and outside of ascended stuff theres no gear treadmill, like its an easy to get xp for masteries which are horizontal progression so all your armour and weapons remain perfect for use no matter what update comes our way!
---
3709 hrs over 460 days 😬
---
nice troll post
---
&gt; ok... Time to buy a few hundred arrow carts and teach these loony frightened bitch some proper map control!
---
Sounds like Yak's bend. You'll enjoy whatever is left of WvW.
---
Why are you saying I'm trolling? That's not very nice in such a positive community :C
---
And today for dungeons/raids?
---
I have spoken.
---
That's a generalization.
---
I LOVE Sieran.  By far, the best and most significant NPC in GW1 and GW2 for myself.  Tybalt?  He's good, I liked him.  Forgal?  I didn't hate him, but didn't really like him either.  No attachment.  A tiny bit for Tybalt, but very strong attachment for Sieran.
---
I think what would be more interesting to analyze is what kind of player personalities attach most to which of the three mentors.
---
For example, one of my closest friends who is very much like me in many aspects, she feels the way I do about Sieran.  Another friend who is quite different from me likes Forgal the best by far.
---
 I think it's also possible that which story you experience first is also a factor.
---
fractal drops would like to have a word with you.
---
Dungeons nobody cares. Half the time you open a dungeon lfg you get some sub lvl 80's wanting to experience it once. Might as well go minion master and roleplay through? Fractals scourge is complete garbage. Reaper and heal scourge can be OK but they're not meta at all. If you do cms people will expect half capable players (no necro). If you do T4 with pugs then they'll barely get 5k dps themselves and it'll be fine. 
---
Raids it's reasonable on condi bosses and was meta for a while (as condi dps). It's not too bad on certain bosses but definitely not top tier. Some bosses scourges can epi bounce; which isn't strictly meta anymore but can be a really effective way of doing these bosses regardless. Sab, SH, VG and some others. 
---
There's a heal scourge build which is NOT meta in and of itself; but is so good at keeping garbage alive and healing them through the mechanics that it's often used by pugs. Probably easier to get into pugs on this build. Frankly if you have 1k li theyll take anything and if you have no li they'll kick you, class be damned. 
---
Still meta WvW, reasonable pvp but not nearly as good as it was early HoT. Kinda needs a support to do well, which you'll never get and then still can be played around.
---
 A P P L E B O I
---
wrong sub
---
If only that fire was blue xD
---
Congratulations on your achievement! Be proud of your accomplishments
---
No worries, I actually did 0:38 without a dodge jump on complete accident because I was too stupid to press two buttons at the same time
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but f2p accounts can't use the gemstore at all
---
Once I got use them them I used that ability to find holes in the maps :P giving me the ability to jump in a game just let's me break out of bounds that much easier lol
---
Because furries tbh...
---
2,5h.
---
The good thing about reaper in pugs is that it is more self-sufficient compared to many other builds and this makes it perform great in actual fights, even if its benchmarks are not the best.
---
Self might, self quickness and self capped crit chance is very important in pugs.
---
Well, some weapons have to be saved for elite specialization, but there's definitely gaps to be filled for core:
---
* Warrior: A 1h ranged weapon.
---
 * It could be a soldier's 'sidearm', an offhand pistol that has an autoattack in the slot 5.
---
 * Or it could be a Javelin, a new new type of weapon that uses spear skins, used mostly for 1h ranged attacks.
---
* Revenant: a 1h ranged weapon, and a second condition weapon.
---
 * They could be the same weapon, like a javeling or a throwing axe.  
---
* Engineer: a 1h melee weapon.
---
 * It could be mace. It could be a part of a rework of engineer skills to give them 5 skill types with 4 skills each like the other professions,  since core engineer has 4 skill types with 5 skill each. One skill from each type would be turned into a fifth (e.g.: Preparations or traps) and part of the Tool kit would be converted into the 5th skill type, and the rest of the skills moved into mace.  
---
* Thief: An offhand weapon that allows it to use the dual wield skills usable only with no offhand, so they can be used without losing the power of one weapon.
---
 * Since they can dual wield their other 1h weapons, the perfect choice would be an offhand word. It could have a counter-block and skill to dash in any direction without changing orientation, but that it's not a shadowstep. 
---
* Ranger: Should definitely have offhand sword in core, because GW2 draws a lot of inspiration from D&amp;D, and there's a trait called "Ambidexterity" that for some reason affects offhand weapons instead main hand weapons used as offhand. 
---
* Elementalist: I always wanted to have offhand scepter, ever since I saw Hopkins with two of them.
---
* Mesmer: As duelists, they should be able to use pistol as man hand too, not just dual swords.
---
* Necromancer: There's a cool sword necromancer should be able to use, the Stygian Blade.
---
Gemstore =/= trading post, and they have limited access to the TP.
---
Open world - Reaper might be the absolute best  class for solo open world stuff
---
Fractals -Reaper is good enough dps and Heal scourge can hard-carry a lot of groups. I've had runs where people couldn't get past the first few trash mobs, i relogged to heal scourge and carried the group through fotm t4 NP.
---
Raids - Not sure TBH, but heal scourge can still hard carry. This is great for bad groups because it can be a life saver. It's also amazing for good groups because heal scourge can allow them to ignore some mechanics and focus more on dps. Also, we're all humans here (i think) people mess up, and your class can save them and prevent wipes. Necro dps has never been top dps in good groups but that's fine imho.
---
PvP - The meta changes often and there's supposedly a huge balance update coming in Q1 that'll shake up the entire meta even more than usual. Condi base necro is the most viable atm i think, reaper is a good tanky bruiser class and scourge can support and help win teamfights and secure nodes.
---
WvW - I never play it, but supposedly Scourge has been dominating it since the launch of PoF
---
Yup. And thankfully I have 5 left
---
Asura and norn are in the first game, especially predominate in EoTN, sylvari are the only new race
---
That's what I ended up doing in my last 50ish T6 mats.
---
Woo!
---
I've stopped doing that a while ago :/ I'd buy 800 gems every few months or so, but now it feels like a slap in the face knowing most probably none of that went into GW2.
---
For raids dps scourge is only good for 2 raid bosses, outside of that its mostly used for 2nd heal in pug groups.
---
In fractals you may get away with reaper, it's fine if you just want to clear your dailys but it's not great and not every group plays with necros.
---
And dungeons are dead anyways so who cares...
---
Imagine having to face Forgal's wife and children as Icebrood in the saga...
---
1. Only if you buy enough character slots to have all 9 classes
---
2. Contingent on having all classes... Also different gamemodes play differently.
---
3. I can't take my WvW firebrand Into PvE because it's all heals no damage. So if a PvE oriented spec comes out it won't work for me.
---
4. Not really. Because while &lt;new ele spec&gt; may play really well with all old specs, when &lt;new necro spec&gt; comes out ele spec may be boosted through the roof due to some synergy they could not see before they were both available.
---
And that can happen with any of the 9 classes combined. So with every elite release they have to look back at every previously released spec (this includes the 16 elite specs released for the other classes already.)
---
Sieran was my girl. I fucking cried like a little bitch when she died
---
Thank you! :)
---
&gt;I'm on team Seiran
---
You're a smart individual. I like you.
---
You know that new Pokemon called Appletun? You know why it's popular? It's because apples. Really the secret is that sylvari should turn into a part-apple race.
---
Because your post has everything troll posts/low-effort posts contain:
---
- An exhaustive long time (7 years) to accomplish something that usually doesn’t take this long
---
- A very bad and blurry picture of a monitor instead of the use of the game’s print screen feature
---
It’s a popular cliché.
---
I don't think I can help *but* smile at this. I'm sure someone will whine about the anatomy pose being not *perfect*, but Glitch if I wouldn't binge read a webcomic done in this style.
---
Anet never told us which table. This could be on the “won’t fix” table next to the “not a bug but a feature” table.
---
Ah yeah, thanks for clarification. I initially meant the TP instead of the gemstore, but I didn't think of wording there. Much appreciated.
---
TBH. I couldn't care less. It's Anet work, I don't expect much.  
---
What has Anet to offer? The only thing they can do correctly is a decent combat system. The stories are shallow, pressing political agenda with flat, boring characters, expected plottwists and a generic fantasy world.  
---
Except Blizzard, old Bioware or From Software authors joined the team.

Dude lol. What a toxic sink hole.

Yeh, I probably was about as unclear as I could be, but usually when someone's in an extremely dramatic pose like this, there's always that dude who has to chime in and go "BUT HER SPINE IS 0.5 DEGREES OFF CENTER! TRASH!", or something.
---
thanks i did not know there was a post about it
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/eg8epo/arenanet_is_working_on_unannounced_3rd_person/  
---
its literally on the frontpage.
---
Okay, so some critical information is being left out here: this happened in a custom game arena, not queued PvP.
---
Custom arenas can have some odd rules setup, including the option to disable "Force Respawn" -- when that option is on, your respawn timer will countdown and when it hits zero, you'll be automatically respawned at your team's point.
---
If Force Respawn off, you'll need to manually click the "Return to a Waypoint" button that appears at the bottom of your screen, right below where it says "You are defeated".
---
That's how it's supposed to work, anyways. Something weird happened in your case: not only did the "Return to a Waypoint" option not appear, your screen also didn't go to greyscale either.This could be the result of some other setting for the custom room that I'm not aware of, or it could be a weird bug.
---
Either way though, it's something that can't happen in queued PvP, where "Force Respawn" is always on, and even the vast majority of custom rooms it shouldn't be an issue -- at the moment, a total of like five rooms out of the several hundred available in the Game Browser have Force Respawn off here on NA (I'd imagine the picture isn't much different on EU).
---
If it is a bug, it's probably never going to be fixed because it's 100% not worth the that it would take a developer to track it down for such an obscure issue that 99.99% of the playerbase will never run into.
---
tl;dr: Not an issue that will affect queued PvP, only custom games. Stick to regular daily rooms that have Force Respawn on and you'll never run into this.
---
well it did not showed for me so
---
Imagine that great journalist Jason Winter reading the sub, taking an entire post as his article and not even mentioning the source.
---
Like it was his idea and he watch the job boards at arenanet 24/7.
---
Yup.
---
Yeah, you really don't need a lot of GPU horsepower to run this gamd
---
The game has gotten so bad that people need to do this garbage just to entertain themselves.
---
This was so savage. It made my day.
---
Same, but I like jumping tho
---
Because apples and because he's far less forgettable than Sieran and Forgal.
---
This is not really relevant after the rune salvaging rework, as you are unable to recover the runes without an Upgrade Extractor or the Endless Upgrade Extractor. Nowadays, the runes get salvaged automatically and you don't get them back.
---
Some maps are definitely easier than others, but generally doing the meta's and hearts on the old maps is quite fast. Bjora's marches is a lot more casual / low effort though.
---
Nope.
---
I've run far too many CMs, pDPS is pDPS, I've never had someone kick over a necro after the buffs in pugs. I've had people kick over inexperience, people leave from 1 wipe, people say "You need to work on your dps, its trash" (which was ironic, as they had the lowest DPS as a dps slot while i doubled theirs) people kick over entitled assholes, people being assholes etc. Never once have I seen a necro get kicked. Hell I've seen plenty of condi classes who never got kicked.
---
The [\[fast\] spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bqPlQu6Nsl8B7e4Gz3BMVyxx_HljibRKqIE6z6ka_IA/edit#gid=1267643489) is perhaps the best set of data for this.
---
Also worth adding that the Metas are still popular enough that new maps might be created at those times, which should eventually spawn unbugged events.
---
Probably my favourite piece of dialogue from the main story. It exudes maximum amounts of badass.
---
These people dont run them, they are just parroting some shitty information. I've personally never seen a necro get kicked outside of the first balance patch long ago that actually made reaper viable in fractals.
---
My first char is a thief, so joining the Order of Whispers made the most sense to me. Tybalt was my first mentor and that made all the difference. Had I chosen otherwise, Sieran or Forgal would have been my favourite for sure.
---
This game runs like shit even on high end gaming computers, I don't see it running well on console.
---
Yes, GW2 is going to die. As if it's not their only relevant title at the moment, and they definitely won't need any funding for a new project.
---
One thing people don't seem to realize is Anet *has* to keep GW2 up and running, and to do that they *have* to release good content to keep people interested, likely including a third expansion at some point. Gem store milking isn't going to work forever, and Living World is free so no revenue from that. 
---
If they want to do other projects, GW2 is their only source of actual income to fund those projects. The other option is bankruptcy, and judging by these new job offers that's not in the plans anytime soon.
---
So something major *has* to be coming, maybe not in the Q1, but definitely at some point next year. Because Anet really has no choice. Keep that in mind before you go turning away new or returning players screaming *THE GAME IS DYING/DEEEAAAAAAD!!!!*
---
LS3 and LS4 are complete and they are dogshit compared to HoT. So far, LS5 doesnt seem any better.
---
Ah yes, I recall this one, main character is Luna, and she's trying to find her BF or something right?
---
I'm not going to let one bad-written moment in a human-centric expansion to take away an entire novel and dozens of of interviews/blogposts.
---

Should I also start using /s to clearly show you I'm shitposting so people don't have to waste their time going through my post history just like you did? /s

No if Anet are smart about this they would be building a completely new team for other games and leaving the dev team of GW2 alone. If they start siphoning devs off GW2 again Anet is done as a company because they would be killing their main money maker whether you like it or not. The people working on other games should be new hires simple as. Anet are perfectionists so if they stop developing GW2 we might not hear from them till 2022 or 2023 knowing how they are that would kill the studio.

Lol, nice backpedaling here.
---
Well, you'd either have to assume I'm about just as retarded as some people who are doing the exact thing I've done, or that I am trolling.
---
&gt; Are you really serious thinking that capes And dynamic hud are content? 
---
Not everything in an expansion is content. Breakbars for example is not content, but it was an important system rework.
---
Generally any expansion should launch with massive system improvements, which is what LS5 opted to do slowly instead.
---
&gt;Season 3 released fractal 99 cm, pvp maps, legendaries and a raid wing within its first quarter. 
---
Those are not expansion features. Those are just upates to existing content forms.
---
&gt;Strike missions have atrocious rewards
---
But that's not a feature problem. That's a balancing problem.
---
Also, do Strike Missions really have bad rewards? They typically fill up instantly on LFG.
---
&gt;The map in bjora doesn’t give amalgamated gemstones which means people will not try to go for the map in the future
---
First of all, there is a possibility the map may expand in the future. So I would assume people will be dooing it fo a looong time.
---
Second of all, it allows you to farm LS4 map currencies faster than any other map except *maybe* Dragonfall.
---
&gt;The story chapter was short.
---
Story is the worst part of GW2. I'm glad it was short.
---
tl;dr: You and I are on completely different wavelengths.
---
On reddit the former happen as equally as the latter.
---
her back must hurt stretching like that
---
I would say that only similar things about those characters is not-blonde-hair, dual wielding pistols and using a quite a bit of whites in the cloth design.
---
tl;dr: they are nowhere near the same.
---
Nice run, though you're still missing some of the shortcuts on the snowflakes part. [You can see (what I believe is) the optimal path in my own (ultimately non-optimal) speedrun from several years ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8plR3gRYWcA)
---
You can also dodge through the snowballs at the end if you can nail the timing, if you really want to try to get a perfect run.
---
U do not remember it but they all hated hot when it was released . It took months and lots of patches to change it to what is now
---
&gt; your screen also didn't go to greyscale either.This could be the result of some other setting for the custom room that I'm not aware of, or it could be a weird bug.
---
it only does that on high pp settings
---
Oh, it's you again.
---
But if you assumed the former your answer would be different.
---
I think the reason why is because like He’s the most....not innocent, but he’s the most “like able” one. 
---
I personally like Forgal because he is...such a badass. Like Tynalts sacrifice was sad because he wasn’t a fighter. And seiran because...well let’s be honest the priory shouldn’t be the one holding the line.
---
So experienced...but wearing an outfit with a gemstore backpiece with no title on.
---
doing the meta and farming the nodes + chests should yield around 150 eternal ice which then translates into 60 of another map's currency. this is rather simple and effortless, however it's also limited. to not burn out i would suggest doing a mix of methods, especially since the most efficient methods on some of the maps is braindead repetition of hearts, of which again some progress atrociously slow.
---
It is definitely because most people chose the Order of Whispers on their first character.
---
Nope. I thought you were a troll that was retarded enough to assume we were more retarded than you lol
---
Damn, that was mean. 
---
However, I can see your point. Will try to up my game a bit by the next time XD
---
another game that's going to be abandoned?
---
That’s the spirit ahah
---
Yeah... Thats why its a joke...
---
You have out of combat movement speed here which isn't a thing anymore fyi.
---
Oh, it was a joke to appear experienced...haha. That's pretty funny; no.
---
You look like a character from Archer.
---
Similar hairstyle (minus the braid), white dress with exposed thighs, dual pistols. Looks pretty similar to me.
---
Came to say this, but you did much better job. 100% agree. 
---
You haven't mentioned Condi Scourge, it can do pretty well in raids too. I've seen Scourges outdpsing even average Mirrages @Largos. Easy 20k+ DPS.  
---
IDK why people in this game are so blinded be "META". You can play absolutely anything and do pretty well if you know what you're doing.
---
Actually I read your messages incorrectly My apologies. I honestly don’t think lws5 will help at all. Balancing will make game modes better but it doesn’t make any person who left from content drought come back. 
---
I don’t think people who left will come back because spirits on Druid and spotter have been deleted on pve. Or say someone coming back because quickness and aegs are deleted from the game. actually wvw and pvp might come back from that 🤔
---
Elite specs would be something that people will come back to more than balance. Nothing in lws5 have been expansion like content besides strikes but the rewards and difficulty need adjusting. 
---
Since most game modes won’t be adding anything new, guildhall housing could be a major thing everyone would want also besides elite specs. However everyone here will stay dreaming because they aren’t on the to do list.
---
You're running pretty lowtier cm groups, even by for pug standarts then. Often better people just ask for "three good fractal classes" (dh/pslb/weaver) and thats it.
---
WvW Scrub here. I see a lot of snarky "WvW ded gam" comments here. Is WvW as active as it was in 2014? No. Is it as busy as it was last year? No. Last night for reset only two of my servers maps had queues, a 20 man que and a 6 person queue. You will only see queues that big on reset now, and sometimes at prime time on T1 servers. But don't let that get you down because there are still many fights to be had if you look for them.
---
Mounts have been the biggest game changer to WvW since the Desert BL was introduced. It's made zerging much easier and safer for newer players to WvW since you can catch up to your group quicker and can move safer in open areas. Mounts travel faster in friendly territory than enemy, but they will be removing that feature next year. Swiftness/Quickness does not effect Mounts. Other than that, Mounts' can't be slowed down or CC'd in anyway, but they have 10KHP (12K with 10% hp runes) and very low toughness which is easy enough to burst down if you have a glassy build. There is also an ability called Lance that you can unlock with WvW Experience that can force a dismount of one player if it hits. It has a 30 second cool down.  Mounts also come with two to three evades and can stomp downs upon engagement, meaning its farely useful to wait on a mount in the corner of a zerg battle and pounce on downed players for kills.
---
Swiftness is still very useful because you can't fight while mounted. It still gives you a speed burst while in combat that can help you get out of AoE rings quicker or get to better posting better. However a lot of players use swiftness to get away as fast as possible then mount up the second they can. Swiftness is still very useful for dueling, roaming, small scale though where it can help you catch your fleeing opponents or escape a bad situation.
---
The Meta for a huge group has Healing Firebrands and Scourges to help mitigate damage. Revs still exist for their high range burst. Spellbreaker's bubbles are still very important for bombs since it strips all their enchantments. I've seen a lot of commanders running Mesmers now for additional boon support. Thiefs and Rangers are still not very useful in zergs, but that hasn't really changed since 2013 anyway. Ele's are useful with Staff as a Weaver for Meteor Showering downs but otherwise, Revs are the kings of range DPS really (it's been hit a bit though).
---
Roaming still lives, its where I spend my time in WvW. You will always find single players flipping camps. But more and more these days its lower ranked players who are newer to WvW as opposed to hardcore vets who know what they are doing. And most "roaming" now is actually what you'd consider small scale or havoc groups. You'll come across a group of three to five players that are built to work together, usually a couple tanky bois (one healer Ele/Firebrand) and then someone who can burst really heavy. That's kinda where roaming is going now so keep that in mind.
---
All they're trying to hint at is that: get used to gemstore upgrades getting complete priority because big daddy NCSoft has now taken on the reins completely. Oh, and please consider playing other NCSoft games which are already heavily monetized compared to GW2.
---
ANet has little say in what actually happens following the lay-offs...including that hilarious announcement with 15+min spent on real life merchandise marketing.
---
"Kind of sad"? I haven't been receiving these cards, yet seeing this is soul-tearing to me, to put it mildly.
---
He's also very, very old. Norn can live for 120+ years, but most don't go that far, because of their tendency to die in battle, which they find honorable and admirable.
---
Forgal once says:
---
&gt; I've only seen such a creature once before—at Port Stalwart, just before the Orrian dragon destroyed the town. Years ago.
---
He says "years ago"-- he means at least 100 years ago. In a way, just the fact that he's that old is a sign of a defeated norn, who should've found a fight worthy of giving his life for by now, but hasn't.
---
&gt; My father died in battle. As did his father. I've always assumed...ah, enough of my jawing.
---
In a way, his death is bittersweet. He finally felt fulfilled, and found a way to complete his legend.
---
Didnt know 100-250 ess requirements was "Low Tier" also some QB groups (No heal) was considered low tier as well. Better people dont give a shit as long as you can pull your weight, speed clears for records and toxic idiots are the only ones who would bitch about a necro as they are at most 2-3k dps off other classes with mechanics involved which is a few extra seconds at most, which matters a ton in records but in actual pugs no one cares.
---
&gt; ...they need an expansion release if they want to have a good bit of money come in...
---
No, they don't.
---
All they need is outfits, mount skins, and now capes in gemstore...preferably locked behind BLC RNG.
---
Minimal effort for basically endless flow of money. If they create a sense of scarcity or urgency, then the fools will rush to purchase these. Overall, they make a LOT more money from them than they would from a single purchase of an expansion, with less effort.
---
This is fucked lol.
---
Man ANet's been wrecked by big daddy
---
Tenebrous and Shimmering pistol combo :D best guns, great art :D
---
I didn't say it wasn't fun, I said no one cares about winning.
---
Glad you care, the vast majority do not, it's as simple as that. I along with 99% of players who do CMs daily **do not care** about a reaper, that's my whole point, you can join 250+ ess groups and be accepted, you can join QB groups and be accepted, once in a great while you might run into an asshole who does but they are wasting another 5+ minutes to shave off 20 seconds tops *if they are just as good*. 99% of players just want a clean, smooth, fast run. One pull, one kill and make it smooth as butter and the group will be happy as shit and go on with their lives and time, that's my whole point. If you want to get into the nitty gritty must have fractal god + infusions and do sub 1 minute pulls thats on you, glad you have the skill and determination to do that and mad respect, that shit is absolutely insane but it doesnt apply here to this particular question, necro, particularly reaper is absolutely fine outside of the elitist speed clear record groups, but they want particular classes for a reason.

*Low-Effort Repost Wars 2020
---
I don't know if you noticed but... this game has ALWAYS been bad for veteran players.  We've known this since launch.  There has never EVER been a satisfying end-game in GW2.  This complaint has never gone away.  I've seen it since week 1.
---
https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43807 is a legit approved retaler for GW2, and it's currently $20. That's probably the best legit deal you'll get right now :) 
---
But to answer your question, 30 bucks is the normal price for PoF and you get HoT bundled in with that!
---
Yeah... see... this.  I posted it elsewhere but GW2 was NEVER good for the veteran players.  People have been complaining about lack of endgame since launch.  I don't know why people who have put 4000 hours keep coming back expecting something that has never actually existed in the first place.
---
One moment?  Aren't there Sylvari Mist Wardens among the defenders in the Melandru area of Dragonfall?  I don't think having their memories go to the Dream needs to be mutually exclusive to going to the Mists; both can happen.  https://i.imgur.com/BJ94oIj.jpg

Okay.

&gt;  I along with 99% of players who do CMs daily do not care about a reaper, that's my whole point,
---
Your point was that literally "no one" "never" cares. Now, apparently, some do. Make it around 15-20% of lfgs and admit that these are just better pug groups that you can get in from lfg (and not some reee evil elitists or abstract record runners), and we're good. 
---
You may ofc stay at lower skill levels where even condi dps classed don't get kicked (sorry, but thats a real big "NO") and necro is ok as fractal power dps then.
---
Sun setting on the GW2 franchise? :(
---
Anet logo nowhere to be seen. NCSOFT plastered everywhere. Yea this is the end...
---
OH NO THEY DIDNT SIGN IT
---
are you serious mate?
---
And he's still not someone that works at Anet no matter how you people want to twist it, he's still no reference point
---
Shitting on the game 24/7 is just what the subreddit does. Just play and draw your own conclusions
---
It is elite specs or bust.
---
And they're probably still there, unaffected by the consequences of their incompetence; except they might be getting paid even more now, lmao.
---
Nice art, and thanks for the link!
---
The way it sounds to me is that when you reach a point in the story your computer just restarts itself? Is there any crash or error log that appears? blue screen? Sounds? Are your graphics drivers up to date through GeForce?
---
You can just feel the lack of human emotion and interaction
---
Try repairing the client. Look up on wiki
---
It's rather more the fact that arenanet had nothing to do with it.
---
Obviously.
---
I wouldn't recommend listening to a streamer who has no inside info who's expressed an opinion many don't agree with. It's easy to say an opinion. Doesn't make you an expert. The stuff Deroir is interested in is completely different than the stuff I'm interested in and so I've come to a different conclusion. I know you think you're doing a service posting this clip over and over again, but it's one post by one guy who not everyone agrees with. Maybe you should make that clear when you post.
---
There was another post about this very issue in last week or so and one suggested reply was playing a youtube video in the background I believe, or something along those lines.  I am not going to try to find that post, because you can do that just as easily, and you're more motivated.  Good luck.
---
I cant think of anyone who complained about HoT who is complaining about the LS. in fact, a lot of the people complaining about the current state of content most likely wouldnt be opposed to the game ramping up to HoT difficulty instead of the insulting level it is now. as far as we know, all the episodes are going to be just as little content as the 1st with nothing new being added
---
&gt;Is there any point in me playing the game?
---
Only you know you.
---
For everyone posting a negative opinion here, someone is in game having a good time and not posting at all. I play the game all the time. I run a guild which quite a few people. I haven't seen the same signs of dissatisfaction that you see here on reddit. Doesn't mean no one is dissatisfied but I think the reddit crowd is a harder core crowd that is particularly disenfranchised with the game. More casual players have less to be annoyed about. Newer players won't reach this level of dissatisfaction until they've played hundreds or even thousands of hours.
---
Then there's guys like me who have played thousands of hours and don't have the same feelings that you're talking about. Try the game, it's worth it.
---
Obviously I made a mistake,  But I managed to recover and I got a good laugh out of it.  So I figured I'd share it and maybe make someone else smile.
---
Sad the sound cut out at the end.. not sure what made relive do that and I'm new at this but you gotta start somewhere right?
---
There are no error logs, everything just resets. It won't be the same thing that causes the crash or I'd try and replicate it and provide the video of what's happening. I can teleport to a waypoint and it'll be fine, I can teleport to that waypoint at a different time and it'll crash, I can be walking through the world map and it'll crash, other times it won't. The longer the story quest the more opportunity for it to fail. Where it failed last night is not where it failed today.  
---
No blue screen, no sound, the drivers are all freshly updated.
---
I'll give that a go, thanks.
---
[What are you on about?](https://imgur.com/a/DZS7ARK)
---
Exactly. Question is, how do I check exactly. Go through all story missions on the wiki?
---
Hey Hollts I enjoy every of your Outnumbered Reaper Gameplays. I'm currently on vacation and just because of your videos I'm getting excited about getting back home and play my reaper again.
---
If you can upload more videos with live comments on your gameplay, my own gameplay will getting much better. There is so much to learn about him. :)
---
That's the exact place where my characters are and no diving goggles for me
---
What server are you on?
---
NA
---
If you pay an additional 300 gems in the store you can get a second, replica card sent. You pay shipping.

---
WOW your Thief looks almost identical to mine, down to the hair and clothing lol. I did just change my look for Wintersday though so I’m wearing something a bit more “cozy”
---
First!
---
I'm really curiousas to why the previous posts got removed... only shows to prove further that this is an echo-chamber community with little valid arguments.
---
Because he reuploaded the video.
---
Congratulations, it’s quite a chore if you aren’t filthy rich. Try a tier 2 one, the collections for those are pretty fun to do. It’s almost like an actual quest chain from other MMOs.
---
To suck a dick?
---
I like fun
---
I know. It was the reupload that got removed previously. I was here..
---
&gt;I'm really curious as to why the previous posts got removed... 
---
Maybe because it is about Guild Wars rather than Guild Wars 2 and thus is off-topic for this sub?
---
This is a good reply.

*closes page*

---
You have 3000 hours of content. Ignore complainers. Most of the do not even play
---
Sub isnt about GW1 or WoW?
---
So it isn’t the shell of a game I seen across reddit and discussion boards? It looks awesome I’m just worried about spending time playing a game that seems to be over? Hope that makes sense
---
This is very relevant for this sub, many gw1 fan here and many people who tried classic wow, there is potential for interesting comments
---
You Can probably enjoy the game a lot, maguma is a blast!
---
Most of the discution are about the poor management and poor content delivery from anet, but there is at least 5 year of content!
---
Content wise you Can have your fun.
---
On another note and i'm sorry to say that : don't expect anything much to Come apart from cash shop update, and i can't recomande you to play if you are looking for a game to invest a lot of Time in
---
RIP that guy at 1:18.
---
According to reddit this game died about two dozen times already. Atleast. Don't pay too much attention to the doomsaying here.
---
Lemme ask why are you running silverwastes? (Unless you only have the base game)
---
I'm shocked to see this here. It was in r/gaming and I thought that was more appropriate.
---
Gw1 fans have their own sub. This video has nothing to do with gw2. Its been already posted today earlier and removed.
---
You think development is over? No more expansions or content updates ever? Or just slower releases?
---
I know another Tequatl bug: I doesn't drop Sunless weapons for me!
---
original
---
Necro in Raids are just bad. Reaper is significantly worse than almost every other dps class. It even does less than hybrids (condi quickbrand does more than reaper), and reaper has a very significant flaw: it can't get healed in shroud, meaning scholar in shroud is basically 0%. Suddenly, the class can't even do 30k in a realistic fight. Add on that it doesn't give quickness like dragonhunter, does less dps, and does less cc, and suddenly not only are you being greedy: you are doing less dps *and* you are providing less to the team.
---
Heal scourge is a very weak off healer compared to something like heal renegade. Heal renegade offers buffs to the team, while healing more than any other healer in the game (potentially, soulcleave). There's no reason to run it over heal renegade.
---
In terms of raids, power quickbrand is also bad, in every sense. Recommending that build shows a lack of understanding of raids. It is literally a useless build.
---
Players complaining here (including me) usually have their 3000+ hours on the game, at which they now feel there is not much more to do.. until then, you will have a blast ;)
---
The game has serious flaws, but even after over 2000 hours I still feel compelled to come back again and again. There is an amazing diversity of content available and I can wholeheartedly recommend it. Find some people to play it with - either some real life friends or join an existing guild - and let the adventure start.
---
I have kicked every reaper in every fractal run I've ever done. It just doesn't compare to weaver/soulbeast/dragonhunter.
---
*rolls eyes*
---
Y’all need to loosen the tinfoil hat. jfc.
---
This video has nothing to do with gw2 so it got removed.
---
That fills me with hope! Do you think we can expect any future updates for the game? Or is it on its final patch/update?
---
There is definitely a lot of things to do for somebody new to the game. I'd say don't let the community discourage you, because this "game is over, maintenance mode soon" has started several years ago and it's still going. You will always find people doing whatever content you want to do.
---
Is the game in “maintenance mode”? Are there any patches or updates to come or is it over?
---
Logged in yesterday after a few months, logged back out
---
They've been screaming the game is dying for years now, and there's still lots of content coming. Pay them no mind
---
That’s awesome stuff!
---
that's retarded, how else am i supposed to get a 420 69 rating? By doing it manually 489 comments?
---
&gt; and that might be the reason that I dislike him(and Rox...and Rytlock as the stories advanced).
---
This, also, does kind of annoy me.
---
Tybalt was cool because he was the first, and different is cool. He was interesting because of it. But then there was Rox, and the Olmakhan, and Rytlock to some degree... Anet seems to be incapable of writing a Charr protagonist that *isn't* some kind of loner-defector from Charr culture.
---
It is still being developed, we are currently in another phase of updates bringing story+content every 2-3 months (i think). While Anet does a poor job of communicating their plans, the game is not dead. Many people were hoping for an expansion after living story season 4 and are disappointed in the slow time it takes to get some changes.
---
However, for someone starting completely new this is nothing you have to be concerned about. Just enjoy it and don't listen to the doomsayers.
---
Thanks very much for this. I’m looking forward to starting! Charr Warrior too tropey? Any class suggestions?
---
It's free. Download it and make your own decision. You'll see how many people are running around in game.
---
They are in the process of releasing some content, the thing is that where an expac would have been good they are doing "free" content who are subpar and can't handle a xandle to anything prior
---
Yes it's over. The content we got a month ago is an illusion and so is the one coming in January. 
---
It's dead Jim.
---
Just play whatever feels right to you. Some classes might be more challenging for a newcomer tho, but you shouldn't be afraid of picking something challenging.
---
Download it and make your own decision. 
---
There's still people on the internet that are flat earthers.
---
&gt;No more expansions
---
I wouldn't expect anymore
---
&gt;content updates
---
living world, nothing else, will probably continue for the foreseeable future at the pace we're getting it now
---
I'll answer your question since I'm here. No I don't think the games worth starting, because I just think there's a ton ton ton of games out just this year that deserve your attention.
---
Are you trying inside the instance, instead of the open map?
---
You sound salty cause you can't afford things.
---
This is just the consequence of NCSoft West taking over GW2 marketing. Which would be great if there were competent people working at NCSoft West.
