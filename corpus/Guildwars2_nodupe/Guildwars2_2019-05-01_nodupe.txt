Maybe the yellow WP are a "mists-version" of the new map? Same map, but a different instance or something
---
---
---
It looks Glint colored to me, with a hint of Vlast colors. Seems fitting to me.
---
Or it could be something like Siren's Landing, where there are special "waypoints" on the map you have to buy to use.
---
love the new Sonic trailer :)
---
Yep. Looks like a glorified dominator greatsword skin to me. Definite pass.
---
It's a waypoint that ports you between the Mists and Tyria. ...Maybe.
---
Hmm, can't. The OEM won't support beta drivers in their repos. I could add Ubuntu graphics drivers ppa, but then I'd lose the optimizations that system76 added for power mgmt as their ppa and the Ubuntu gfx drivers ppa conflict
---
&gt; Just skip the gold ore and plants
---

---
Gold ore is worthless, some plants are not. Jungle Plants, Ghost Peppers, and Truffles come to mind. Mussels for that rare chance at a pearl, too.
---
I teach the game to a lot of new players. I even have a player named New Player Helper. IF you're a free to play player, I have to add you before you contact me. If you've paid for the game, add me on Vayne.8563. Logging in now.
---
Absolutely this, there are a lot of bad players out there, but there are also good players out there. Generally if you know what you want and ask for specific roles you will get players that know what is up. I pay with a buddy that plays alacrigade and I play healbrand and asking for "T4 | 3dps | P+F" yields good results that usually end up in sub 30min times. If we would actually not run support roles and just went with static stuff times would even be faster. It also depends on the fractals themsevles though.
---
I think sw/f GS is the best set up for open world. You can still do good DPS but you gain a lot more from having focus pull than having offhand sword skills.

There's already 3 others, that make it to 4 total legendary greatswords.

Nearly all of my armor cosmetics are core. It's the norm for new stuff to have something glowy/on fire/spikey on it, and that turns me off of it. I will say that I did like the dragonsblood pistol and most of the elegy armor.
---

---
I'm just sad we got the requisite GW2 boob/thigh/belly windows for the female armor. Don't even need to see the male version to know those open spots will be covered for them. :/
---
I love how the GS has cool effects without being super obnoxious and glowy! More of this, please.
---
&gt;A static can clear t4 daily in 30 minutes average, but pretending a pug can average 30 minutes is just delusional.
---
I guess all my past months of fractal experience are delusional then.
---
Why not both?

Thanks, now that I have the answer it feel so obvious lol, just escape character &gt;&lt;
---
There is no one who can band together. At best 3-5 players on all maps combined. Anet has never cared about WvW and those population imbalances. This week it's simply not worth playing wvw.
---
Yeap...Imagine if it was literally translucent/reflective crystal plated armor instead of, let's stick some spiky rocks on the shoulders, gauntlets and boots.
---
It really isn't that daunting. If you use gw2efficiency, it can lay out a step by step list of everything you need - which if you're starting from scratch can look like a huge amount of effort and expense, but just focus on one factor at a time, and remember there's no rush. Well worth it if there is a particular skin you really want.

How do people justify using shared slots for it? Having to remember to remove the tools, put them in a new slot, change chars, equp them back on... like wtf. I use a new character slot for every different build for the same reason; switching anything in this game is not very efficient except maybe for runes and infusions on legendary gear; even swapping legendary gear to another character is too annoying.
---
Shared inventory slots for tools is extremely burdensome because of all the steps involved. I use a different char for every build I have for the same reason.

It's a very minor thing and I have no idea how it could be any easier. It's already easier and more convenient to swap things around ( both gear and traits etc ) than in pretty much any other game I've played.

I’d say it’s a great time to get into Guild Wars right now.
---
With the soon arriving finale for season 4 living world, a refocus on advertising to help grow playerbase beyond the friendly core currently, its a perfect time. Especially as it’s free to play the core game, and you’ll have the option of two expansions and three playable seasons if you enjoy the story and community. 
---
As for guides, Dulfy is always good for resources, the wikia is detailed and helpful, and in game you’ll find lots of people are willing to help new players if they’re stuck or looking for advice :)
---
But why should MMOs be exempt to this practice and why settle for it at all when it can be preserved by emulation and people would be even willing to?
---
From an archival stand point I think it's pretty interesting, though I'm not sure how viable it would necessarily be, especially since a game like GW is such a (in my opinion) personal game. It's also, in a way, a living entity and part of the joy of the game is in continued interaction with it and with other players in it, including the creation of new data in the form of characters, fashion wars etc, which I don't think would fit well with an archival (ie nothing in this version of the game changes because then it would still be a living game) scenario. 
---
I'm also not sure that emulation software is at a level where it could sustain peoples interest if there's no way to progress through the game as an individual. 
---
Perhaps it could be "archived" in such a way where it looks more like a console game? In the sense that there would be 9 characters (ie one of each class) that you could choose to play but you wouldn't be able to choose race/what armor you equip/fashion wars to the same extent that you're able to now. But then, that would also very much be a game changer, in the literal sense.
---
Thanks, on it!
---
Got it, time to mine then! Thanks
---
I agree that the current climate does not indicate the support to stop. I simply had other games in mind such as City of Heroes and Wildstar, both being shut down for not turning enough profit. I am not sure if anything in regards to Arenanet’s games is different that I am not seeing.
---
Ha, I got a kick out of that anetsux one too.
---
Most of the animations and effects are mesmer-centric ... Not everyone are auto-attacking like that or need to throw your sword out that frequently but wanna see these transformation T.T
---
I honestly have no idea what point you are trying to make.
---
heh, I just updated my post to add a little more info as you replied. copying it here:
---
Take a look at, say, Sharur, and replace hammer-specific parts with GS equivalents (Also, material gift for Gift of Exordium might be different). Also apparently making off-hand shards and exchanging them for boxes of legendary shards is cheaper than making 2h weapon shards
---
What are some more options if I just want to log in after work and just fight some things? I'm talking around the area of just mindless mmo grinding with moderate purpose when I am not feeling like sitting around waiting for meta events.
---
There's WAY more options then I thought there would be. Honestly not too sure what to  pick.
---
I noticed!:) thanks a lot!:)
---
I have issues with those sites too. I start out with them when learning a class to get an idea of how different abilities and traits can interact and be utilized. Beyond that though, I start to disagree with some design choices of some builds.

Never happens. I stop after I lose two rolls and try again later. I don't gamble after reaching 500g. That's where the other 2% of my gold making comes from which is usually casual WvW or occasional PvE. Usually takes a week or so before I recover enough gold to try again. Most times I have enough that I don't need to do this though.  
---
And with that said, I _have_ gone completely broke more than a few times, but only during times I didn't care if I was or not. I have just about everything I need/want already, to the point I've bought things for the sake of buying it. I've also given away _thousands_ of gold, precursors and other valuable items just because I can.  
---
Not saying gambling is a foolproof way of making gold, because it's not, but it works for me. A lot of people seem to frown upon it when I say this though, lol.

&gt;bear in mind that the emulation of game servers is possible.
---
There's a pretty big difference between **possible** and **feasible**.
---
If you are a game studio, what possible gain is there for you to spend the time/money/manpower to write this "server emulation"? Can you make money from it? Does it justify the cost? Obviously no.
---
I have already dubbed this new map as “Kralky’s Demise”
---
Even if it doesn’t end up being called that, I will continue to call it that anyway
---
Given the precedence in MMOs it’s natural to assume that they will eventually shut down but exploring to challenge this idea could shape future development.
---
As far as licensing the companies would not relinquish any of their intellectual property, merely providing consumers with a tool to access a game they have purchased in the past. It’s not like they’d have been given the tools to change the game at its core or even profit from it (although that may be a whole different discussion).
---
Given your last paragraph (excluding your TL;DR) I know that I cannot make you watch the video but I highly implore you to take the time to watch it eventually as it makes the case why a game shouldn’t be considered a service but a good. I could do it but I feel like the content creator did a much better job at explaining it than I will in a single post. 
---
As for the motivation I had hoped that the developers would themselves want their game to exist for longer than it is merely profitable. So people in the future can continue enjoying all the effort which was put into it.
---
Is this a book about Guild Wars?
---
I wish it was less crazy designs though. The PoF armors are way overdesigned imo, full of all kinds of impractical and silly bits and bobs which makes them very hard to mix and match, I also don't think most of the expansion armors look very good.
---
I want some more traditional clothing types and armors like the core game had, just with enhanced textures and designs from cultures they didn't tap into much (like Canthan armor design). My big fear is if we do go to Cantha, they won't do the asian themed armors we got in Factions, but instead will get some kind of insano, complex mess of crazy taped to some leather.

The software required to run it in an emulated state is indeed one of the parts I am most concerned about. Hopefully there’s some indication by ANet in the future as to why it will or will not happen. Most likely there will be no news on that at all but given the implications it seems understandable.
---
I suppose the topic of how the game would look like in an archived state is something far in the future which has to be dealt with but is nevertheless interesting to explore with items such as PvP tournaments, daily/weekly objectives and WvW. Perhaps it would resemble something like a private (mega-)server.

---
I think considering what it would look like archived is one of the most important aspects to it, since that would determine how much data has to be stored somewhere. 
---
Are everyone's accounts and characters being kept? Will they still be able to access/play? Would the archived version be open to people who don't have an account? 
---
And also, what is the purpose of archiving an MMO in a playable state? Isn't that what GW1 is already doing? It's effectively "archived" in that no content is being added, but people can still play it and create new account. Is that even considered archiving?
---
Wouldn't removing it from being playable in the unique manner that MMOs gives us be one of the central issues surrounding archiving it?  
---
Naturally there's always value to archiving a piece of work, but I don't think there's a way to "archive" it in the traditional sense while still keeping it as a meaningful MMO.
---
sh-shit
---
they're gorgeous
---
I am new and just started playing. I was very impressed by character creation, by far the best i've seen in an MMO, and then utter letdown to see that a key event/mission in the sylvari starting area was apparently broken and just had a bunch of people standing around asking what to do...
---
Is this a common problem? Very big red flag if such a vital part of the game, the tutorial, immediately has bugs.    
---

&gt;If you're interested in at most three of the skins, buy select licenses.
---
&gt;If you're interested in seven skins or more, just buy the 15-pack.
---
Yup that's pretty much my logic. I liked a lot of skins in the desert racer set so filled that out, but only slecet bought starfall from distant lands, starshell from exotic, and stardrift from istani.
---
&gt; To gain insight from ANet, if they wish to pitch in, which seems unlikely. And is not for the company themselves to emulate but providing consumers with the means to do it themselves.
---
you don't need anet to chime in. "server emulation" is realistically impossible.
---
[Askagamedev](https://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/184530414571/regarding-that-video-about-games-as-a-service) has already answered this quite adequately, so i won't try to paraphrase him.
---
specifically, here is the answer that makes this idea impossible:
---
&gt; the proposed solution of “the publishers should release the files and documentation” after the game gets shut down can be downright problematic and shows an inherent lack of familiarity with how games actually work. Let’s take a somewhat recently-defunct Game as a Service as an example: the Marvel Heroes MMOG. First off, there’s the legal problem of handing over game data that’s full of licensed characters when they no longer own the license. Are players somehow going to be allowed to run their own private servers without legal permission from Marvel and Disney? It certainly doesn’t seem like they’d be too pleased about that. Then consider that the server binaries and files may or may not require additional software licenses of its own. Any game like that needs a back end database to store player and character data. We can’t give players a license to set up an Oracle Database, you’d have to pay the hundreds or thousands of dollars for that yourself. We can’t give players access to the Amazon Web Services cloud if our game is built on that. And what do we do about the player and character data itself? Do we give full copies of the back end database to everybody? I’d be afraid of privacy issues in that case. How long would all of these things have to be made available? 
---
--
---
-Askagamedev
---
or tl;dr: developers cannot just hand out the means to "server emulate", because the technology required to do so consists of things that aren't theirs to give away.
---
Code or you get it via mail in-game?
---
Dude .. Maclaine left the company :'(
---
Thank you! :D
---
That's why I was having such fun with drawing the picture hahah Beauty and the beast is probably my favourite disney movie
---
Yess thank you!
---
Thank you *so* much for this. I've been asking for this sort of stuff on legendaries for such a long time. I don't even actively play the game now and certainly won't be making it for a long time but the inclusion of those little details goes such a long way.
---
I fantasize about this happening for the older legendaries in a pass ala the old dreamer/moot ones from a while back. (howler desperately needs love.) unrealistic perhaps, but a guy can dream.
---
Which # Elder Dragon will this be if we end up killing Kralk? Isn't Tyria suppose to basically fall apart if we kill 3 or something?
---
What I figure is that there is a beancounter somewhere who has all the costs listed with keeping the servers up, and I mean everything from maintenance to electricity.
---
When that number goes higher than the money they are making as a company, expect a shutdown...so not for a long long time. I bet they are still making decent money off guild wars.
---
&gt; when it doesn’t necessarily have to be that way. 
---
But it does have to be. Unless you find another company somehow willing to pay both for license and hardware to host a dead mmo (and it will be dead by that point, that's why the servers will have shut down), there's no realistic way to keep it going. Private persons can't just afford to emulate an entire MMO for anything but a miniscule fraction of an MMO's population.
---
That looks amazing!

That's a very nice metallic looking armor-set.  (Please tell me this isn't an outfit D:)

---
2) imagining it, think it would be a weird thing to implement right now unless there's a brand new hylek culture somewhere in the upcoming season
---
3) We help a lot of races
---
4) Yes, like we have for most races we see? Only one that I can't think of is tengu, but that could just be because there isn't much sexual dimorphism

---
The so called "harassment" of the in the ingame players by OP was, as stated by OP, "a few joke messages about selling raids for in game gold". Most definitely not harassment. Now what is harassment is mass reporting a player because of something like this or their refusal to do something prior. The edit is addressing that the jokes were possibly the cause of mass reporting and that it's not worth to be falsely flagged and go through this process. These sort of player interactions happen thousands, if not tens of thousands, of times daily and I would argue that OPs reaction is quite sensible in comparison to many other reactions  which don't result in any punishment.
---
As you said there is nothing posted on the reddit account. As in nothing to revoke the fact that they are innocent and as I stated before, innocent until proven guilty. You want verified information about them when it is not necessary for the kind of post here because, and I will state this for the tenth time, OP is only asking for advice on how to approach the situation and the rest is background information on what happened in order to help any commenters with giving advice fitting to the situation. 
---
While I agree there could be bias if any verification on a lot of other things  would come from those who know OP, there is no bias in verifying that OP is indeed the same person here as in game. Me being a guildie in fact further strengthens my claim when I say that OP is not hiding on an account. 
---
As for the mass reporting punishment deal,  I can't say with 100% certainty that mass reporting results always in a a short mandatory ban/suspension (or some form of account locking while anet reviews the issue)  however this is just  information I've come across from many players in game, on this sub and other platforms and that seems to be a general consensus on what happens with mass reporting. I don't think such a claim is far fetched at all either as similar cases have  appeared in other games.
---
I suggested that this may be the case because it seems to be the most likely answer with what information is given. If you have any other ideas as to the cause of the ban then go ahead and lay em out but I expect all I'd hear is about false information and similar claims.
---
Welcome! And also sorry to hear about your issues
---
It's not an issue that I've personally ever encountered, and this is over multiple sylvari characters. It's also not on the known issue tracker as of February 25th of this year, so it may be something new that seems to have broken with a recent patch

If you're just looking to turn laurels into gold, then the current best method is to use laurels to buy Medium Crafting Bags, open them for T4 materials, and then sell those materials on the trading post. 
---
[GW2effiency.com conveniently tracks the best use of laurels for profit here.](https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/laurels)
---
Now, if you should use laurels for ascended accessories is a bit harder of a question. Personally, I would say that it depends on which Living World season 3 and 4 maps you have access to, if any. The unique currencies from these maps can be used to buy ascended rings, amulets, back pieces, and accessories with selectable stats.
---
For example, Winterberries from S3E3 ('A Crack In the Ice') can be easily farmed on multiple characters and traded in for [ascended rings](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Ice_Band) and [accessories](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Ice_Earring).
---
[The bottom of the chart here on the game's wiki breaks down which maps you can get each type of trinket from.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_trinket#Trinkets_with_selectable_prefixes)
---
If you have access to those maps, it's not worth trading laurels for ascended trinkets because you can readily farm them for currencies to trade for trinkets.

ghost farming in blazeridge steppes is pretty mindless, and you get a pretty decent supply of T4 dusts from it
---
Just be aware, mindless farming is fine, ArenaNet does check to see if you're actually a bot or not
---
&gt; Are you just replying to yourself without reading a thing I'm saying? The owners of those accounts all had other accounts banned during the banwave AND those accounts were all banned in previous banwaves, too. They were hacking/botting/etc on their alts and not on their mains, which were already banned previously. It makes absolute sense to ban all accounts associated with hackers, botters, and cheaters of other categories. ArenaNet must've been in a really good mood to let the cheaters have their mains back. 
---
Or, and here me out, instead of some stupid bullshit about Anet being in a good mood.  MAYBE Anet realized they might have accidentally been trigger happy

---
&gt; In the video the creator stated that the creation of tools to emulate a server which is capable of sustaining the games depends on the quality of the code and competence of the developers and could reach from just under an hour to a few days. 
---
I watched that part.  Made sure to find it and hear him out.  But he provided zero credentials for the developer he claims to have interviewed.  Nor do we see the original context in which the question was asked.  GaaS games vary wildly in depth &amp; complexity.  MMOs for example are far more complex than matchmaking only ones.  We don't know if 1) the dev he talked to was a dev for one or other such game 2) had any prior experience on these types of games or 3) if the varying depth &amp; complexity was considered when answering the question of "how long".
---
All that said, without the source's creds, I'm hesitant to take someone at their word when they say they intend to start a "war" and are giving the "troops" the "ammo" to fight their war with them.

It is also with a squad of skimmer riding Olmakhan. So is it could be event related?
---
Theory: some sort of event beacon and mobile waypoint? If you are sitting around looking for an event to join on in a map, an single orange beacon/waypoint for each major event would be a good way to show people around without cluttering the map with the handful of orange markers, circles, and arrows all over the whole map.
---
Lore wise waypoints are constrained by ley lines geography, but at this point, the whole ley system is pretty fubar, so, maybe some new mobile waypoint tech, to complement the commander's supposed handheld waypoint entrance.
---
Glad you like it
---
Add "Falseprophet.1502" or "Recycled Spirit" in-game, willing to help and answer any questions!
---
I'd be more likely to regularly use Boosters (and food, and utilities, and Guild buffs to an extent) if I could put them on a toolbar rather than having to open my bags and find them. As it is, I can go days without noticing that my Guild buff is gone, let alone my 30-minute food buff.
---
This was always my problem with "wizard" classes in RPGs. Most of the time they are there to just button mash fireballs and lightning, and usually don't have complex game mechanics.
---
Personally, I really like to kill awakened inquest in Kourna for mindless farming. They drop a variety of t5 mats and also some t6 totems and dust, and the totems are worth a lot. But it's also just a really easy area to run from one end to the other randomly killing things, and then run back and kill them all again because they'll have already respawned. Plus the Kourna meta event happens pretty frequently (\~30 mins or so, not on a set timer) so you can kill inquest til the meta is up, run and do the meta, and go back to killing inquest. Not saying it's a super efficient way to farm, but I find it relaxing and enjoy doing it while listening to podcasts.
---
Well the good news is this is likely the last of the crystal themed armors as the story will go in a new direction after ep6.
---
Minstrel can also be used in raids to tank quite reliably!
---
It's not about there not being being enough other players to play with it's about the economy and item availability.
---
If it were a pink or purple giant floppy dildo, I'd be down
---
I couldn't decide so I just shoved it into my bank along with the weapon skin voucher.
---
I'll open it again in a few months once I'm brave enough.
---
I used to donate when I used to play a lot years ago. Just now want to again hopefully.
---
I really hope that this is DS 2.0 and that we get to kill Kralkatorrik as a big, open world event.
---
Open world is the only way they can convey the scope of an army all rushing a giant dragon.
---
I know them feels.
---
True, but he's just saying that it has technically happened before
---
The nullification sigils were problematic, but I found the requiem armor overall pretty ok minus those. It actually takes a long time to gather enough currency for all 3 sets.
---
I also haven't gotten it. Are they being released in waves?
---
Those are not part of Sparkfly Fen though. I was only referring to the Tequatl example.
---
It's worth being in both servers but yeah it's not hard to see that there's more activity on RA lately.
---
Nice, what color purple did you use?
---
I don't believe you need to level all the way to 80, because you should have a sense of gameplay mechanics before that, but at least take some time to level up and learn your profession
---
The big concern is that you boost to 80, and that opens up a lot of choices and freedom for you, which might seem like a blessing, but it can also be overwhelming to understand what everything does and what you're supposed to be doing.
---
Would be nice for all those random exotics currently worth like 30s. Might make getting a random exotic drop feel better.
---
awesome artwork
---
Liked how it looked at its base but not really a fan of the animation when you’re fighting.  Shame because I love the shining blade and this has a similar feel.
---
what exactly do you mean by "hybrid-builds"  here? 
---
Do you mean, for example, a build that does damage and healing, both to a lesser degree than someone who is dedicated healing or dedicated dps? Because, I mean, you can do that, but it won't be super effective in the long run
---
Classes aren't really "set-in-stone" as you say, because each class has the ability to fit multiple roles in a party, depending on gear, skills chosen, and traits chosen. A ranger for example joins a party that needs a healer, and it can swap over to its healing spec, druid. But if the party already has a healer, it can swap over to its dps spec, soulbeast. So your role isn't predetermined entirely by your class. That being said, some classes perform certain roles much better, i.e. a warrior healer is really not a thing you'll ever see.
---
boss mechanics are something I'm okay with. And I am definitely okay with using Action Combat too. However, in regards to character's playstyles ... If AoE Builds has a definitive dominance in stuff like PvP, " performance " ( via numbers in raids ) then .. wouldn't that be a problem?
---
I am not a PvPer per say, and wouldn't mind just doing PvE stuff ( unless there's Open-World Dungeons which might be unavoidable ) then .. idk. I just think the Pros and Cons will diverge at some point, ya know?
---
Is this the only weapon that has custom animations for various skills like spatial surge?
---
No, it's their own fantasy universe.
---
Friendly but generally unappealing in anything that isn’t maintained instanced content.  Aka Fractals of the Mists &amp; Raids.
---
But I’ve been playing long enough that I don’t ever play those specifically for loot anymore but rather just for the fun.
---
Which one are you unsure of? I'll need to expand more on the guide's details but it does link to the wiki pages of items for now.
---
This question would have many answers based on your end goal.
---
For me personally it doesn’t matter much, loot in general is something that you can use, if not it’s something you can salvage for mats or sell it for gold, the price will be based on stats and skin ^^
---
Loot is could be a precursor weapon that would sell for a ton of gold, or you use it your self to make your own legendary weapon.
---
Fractals loot drop ascended gear and the cool thing even if you get the stats you don’t want, you can change the stats to something you need.
---
I find the name quite interesting.  Meaning "A Beginning" .. feels almost like this isn't the only GS we'll get from Gen 2. o_O
---
The thord sounds accurate for my necromancer
---
All classes have AoE, altough Thieves and Mesmers have less then a Warrior or Elementalist. I dont really see a reason why you wouldnt want AoE. It doesnt matter damage wise and makes a ton of things easier. If you dont like the venn diagrams just pick Warrior. Melee attacks have AoE, but no circles.
---
Hybrid sucks in PvE. You want to focus on something in particular. Barely any skill is Hybrid too, as they tend to be either power or condi damage, defensive, heal or utility.
---
The only place where Hybrid works is in WvW (the stats got removed from PvP due to being broken) and then only for some classes. I know Necros can use it, but they are also the masters of creating venn diagrams in WvW.
---
Gift of Metal probably the gift you need for this one considering the other 2 GS required it.
---
If anyone that didnt got the confirmation email when changing the subscription because you were already subbed, please let us know.
---
No, it's a universe and story they created from scratch. It's been in the works for a *long* time now.
---
They have target caps for balance issues. 
---
I still don't understand. What really defines an AoE to you? For instance, a Jedi Knight's first ability hits one target, but a warrior's first sword ability can hit 3. They're both melee range, they both have some horizontal movement, and they can both have the weapon look like it hits multiple targets. I'm not saying you'll see GW2 on /r/hitboxporn, but finding true single target is very hard to do, simply because of the nature of the game, not the balance of the game.
---
Ascended stats can be changed relatively cheaply once the set is made so changing builds isn't a huge deal. That being said I worked and made legendary armor from wvw and swapping stats and runes on the fly is a godsend for someone who likes changing it up a lot. Something to work for after the set maybe.
---
Yea I went to the wiki links, the food for low levels and apprentice tuning crystal
---
This is like the april fools patch notes but a million times more random. I love it.
---
&gt;Chain. Strike your foe through the ground. Damages foes for 50% of their health.

And now, you can two-shot any boss you want!

&gt;Manifest sand shade to inflict burning on nearby enemies into torment and creating two clones that cast ether bolt. 
---

---
&gt;Matthias pulses heat-wave damage every 3 seconds, damaging all foes around you, inflicting weakness, gaining barrier, and gaining kalla's fervor. 
---
I've never fought Matthias before but this sounds terrifying.
---
&gt;Banner. Place a banner that increases in size. 
---
until it fills your whole screen?
---
&gt;Toss elixir s, granting stealth to allies and die if the attack is not blocked
---
WAIT WHAT
---
Feel free to either privately message me or reply to this comment once you’ve had the chance to check up on the video as I’d like to hear your opinion on the good/service distinction given.
---
Impressive.
---
Ah ok, I'll include that the prices are for the [trading post](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trading_Post) and explain that a little. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
Yep. That would be great. Also DS is a great meta
---
Well just the just the sheer thought of knowing that Hybrid builds exists is a plus for me via more flavor to the character. so thx for that.
---
&gt;*All classes have AoE, altough Thieves and Mesmers have less then a Warrior or Elementalist.*
---
I'm pretty sure this answers the initial question perfectly, thx again
---
What is your account name?
---
experience the game at least once (first time is good for this) 0-80ish, get in some personal story, and living world story stuff if order if those things interest you, take your time explore listen to ambient dialogue check out some nice views w/e floats your boat.  Imo its not a terrible idea to use one of them to boost to 80 so you can unlock the glider and the raptor mount. Both are unlocked in the first mission for their respective expansions, Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire. 
---
As for which character you boost thats up to you. Its important to note that you can try out a boosted character in the silver wastes map (boosted characters get sent here) you can talk to some NPC for info, run around kill stuff (any loot you get is all yours) If you dont like it for what ever reason you can undo the boost and try it out on a different character *important note here* So long as that character has not left the silver wastes map, once you do the boost sticks.
---
Bro.. "2k19" is the same amount of characters as "2019" but you have to reach even further to hit the "k"... wtf? Just type 2019 you fucking idiot.
---
It was rushed and that point I don't think they had really figured out make fights against beings that are gigantic and far more powerfull than player character could ever be, especially when not ab open world (which were reworked).
---
Don't look the up unless you don't care about heavy spoilers but both Mordremoth (who has two fights, an open world boss battle and a traditional fight with a smaller avatar) and Kralkatorrik are much more satisfying.
---
You don’t have to run, design your own build
---
Yes and in a world with free speach i can comment whatever i want whether it's to your liking or not.
---
Beautiful Art
---
9th cosplay can u tell that shoulder plate name plzz
---
This is fucking astoundingly beautiful.
---
UW is host, FSP got degraded to link. And tbh, I don't see many FSP players online atm.
---
Download archive with name d912pxy_v&lt;version&gt;_r&lt;revision&gt; from here https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/releases
---
I’d say it depends per player, if you can’t handle starting off rather slow then go for the boost, you have 2 anyways so why not. You might feel lost tho so I do recommend seeing YouTube videos for what kind of content there is at endgame or ask twitch streamers for a bit of guidance
---
Here's [my list from earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b8uelf/any_recommended_add_ons/ek0h43e/).
---
Oh boy.
---
First point is allready wrong, stopped reading ;-)
---
yea pharus needs a rework too
---
You can always just leave it in your bank and spend it on a light armor piece later. Otherwise, once you craft it, there is not much you can do with it other than spending it on the armor.
---
I started myself recently and having a blast. This is the experience I was looking for a long time. The community is awesome!
---
You can delete it or save it and create a couple more and get 1 light piece of armor or create 19 more and get a whole set of light armor.
---
Other than deleting or saving, no, there's nothing you can do with a single spare.
---
That's a first.
---
Mirage can use Dodge while CCd. I'm not talking about stunbreak trait. Other People can't Dodge while stunned, immobilized etc. Because Mesmers amirite
---
Illusionary ambush, utility skill, works because it breaks targeting and makes most people confused. I use it and stand still pretending to be clone. Fools people almost everytime. Most people are gold and below.
---
I know there is one in Ascalon. Ghosts contest it, newbie zone I think.
---
Nice, good one :D
---
It would be hard, as we don't have old female faces....
---
Perseverance for the gold dye, rest is Shadow Abyss.
---
&gt; How many crystal themed armors
---
exceptionally few
---
Will I get better quality from recording the pre-rendered ingame cutscenes myself or ripping them from youtube? From my understanding the ingame ones have a fairly low resolution but the youtube ones obviously suffer from compression, so I'm not sure what to do.
---
But it really isn't worth burning the pages to build two more marks to then salvage the armor right?  Better to just bank it for a rainy day right?
---
Great idea to spread it around! It's a sad situation that Josh is currently in (and few other former devs), I hope this helps him even a little bit. You can read more about things he's going through in his blog.
---
Yeah, fotm progression is good but one needs to craft their armor before IMO. So RIBA to frac would be what I would do if I were him.
---
You can ask the support if they can switch your mark.
---
probably banned for selling items for IRL money
---
He's still going to write music for gw2.
---
If he would know what he is doing, he wouldnt ask for raid training, would he?
---
I'm still running it every saturday and every sunday. 16:00utc, EU
---
And yesterday i've met a guy who runs it every tuesday (EU too)
---
You could know what you're doing with your class without knowing the encounters and receive training for them :)
---
That said if you have no clue what you're doing, no amount of ascended is going to help you either!
---
Got no confirmation, [still got the mask](https://i.imgur.com/sAA8vhr.jpg).
---
Gotta go fast
---
Since the mounts the difference isn't as big as it was. Classes with stealth might be slightly faster, but I don't think it matters that much anymore.
---
But even players who have no clue what they are doing can be trained. And its probably easier taught the better your stats.
---
If you have nvidia just skip fancy stuff like Arch or Gentoo or Fedora. The trouble ain't worth it.
---
Oh no..
---
they had to fix sigil economy at SOME point, i guess. and you can fault just a few players for buying almost every single sigil on the tp and making it rare and expensive. i just finished the collection now, when panic and excitement died down. i didn't mind it tho, the game needs new gold sinks.
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?
---
Due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator+subreddit%3Aguildwars2&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). If you think your thread should be allowed to stay or if this was a mistake do report this comment or send a modmail and Pact commander will come take a look.
---
Good work! I'm just coming back from since POF released so I'm going to work towards this plus living story.
---
isn't that bestiality
---
Mount Radial, should be added to the game full time
---
That's what I planned on doing, had a couple hours before work tonight and decided to level a second toon with the item. Didn't practice with it, just went right into the mission and got my ass handed to me lol. Definitely take a little bit to get a couple synergies figured out before you jump in
---
&gt; The death of the hover movement ability now hovers at a much greater height.
---
&gt; Spectral. Assume the form of a dodge roll.
---
&gt; Summon a sun spirit that causes nearby allies for a short time.
---
&gt; Order the hammer of wisdom to knock down a distant target. Causes instant death. Negated by having a champion blessed with exile's embrace.
---
&gt; Throw a punch of concentrated water.
---
&gt; Wrap your foot in stone and kick your enemy.
---
&gt; Beast. Shadowstep to the first tier of precursor weapons.
---
&gt; You can now interact with nuhoch wallows. Doing so will instantly transport you between wallow entrances and exits in the largos' domain, allowing them to hunt down anyone who remains in it for too long.
---
Thanks
---
I did it for Core game, Hot, LS3, PoF, LS4 with my ranger including story. The core map also with guardian cause it was my first character. the hot maps are easy since there are very good and experienced commanders for HP trains and you can cover almost 50% + of map very fast even if you don't have updraft on glider.
---
For a moment I was hyped for an ingame collection achievement.
---
a what?
---
Maybe a reason a meaner to actually use a greatsword. Maybe.
---
actually, a hybrid plaguedoctor necro is amazing in raids where solo healing doesn't work out (either because of the healer or the group being attracted to AoE circles) but you don't want a full second healer. I usually am at around 50% of a full DPS and still spam barrier, can epi and most importantly ress fast. it's never meta, but most pugs don't play on a meta level, despite what they may think.
---
there's also a few hybrid grieving (power/Condi) builds that perform very well. not meta either, but for new players it can be better to focus on one set of gear that works both for open world and instances before further optimizing with a set for each. like a grieving firebrand is way better in open world than viper, the difference is very clear, but for instances you generally would go power DH or viper FB, grieving FB won't reach either of those builds numbers but can still perform well enough to easily clear every DPS check like gorse no updrafts (except largos probably, those want confusion)
---
😢everyone else is saying I need many different sets. I like to see big numbers! Vipers I thought was good for that
---
Tybalt, introduction
---
Yes, commander
---
Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:  
---
* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.
---
You said you liked condi right? Just go for vipers for a really strong condi build. Using axe/torch and scept/focus for ranged. When you go wvw use minstrel set and you'd be good
---
I know, it was a bit of a troll post \^\^
---
A really good looking GS, but i still think Eternity is better.
---
Apart from gift of battle, and armor sets, anything you feel like tracking. WvW, you want to kill people, capture structures, alone or with group is up to you.
---
Warrior is always good, no matter what, you can find a way to play it. Start with some meta build. And see how it goes.
---
If they are pre-rendered by definition ones you have are in OG compression, ones on channel are recompressed by youtube.
---
tekkit's build is roughly in the right direction but it's influenced by him multiboxing 100 accounts and general laziness
---
i would suggest something like [this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vdAQFAUk1ahydRB2gRYAQv6xeuD-jRBXQB9Q9He9AAAw+jyvHoE0k6IAA-e)
---
it's just the important stuff, there are some options for the last traitline:
---
explosives with minesweeper and stamina sigil for dodge-tagging (not that great tbh)
---
alchemy with hgh elixirs for chug-and-forget or maybe purity of purpose with purge gyro and med kit if condis are a problem
---
inventions with bunker down (probably best tagging)
---
i use scholar rune cuz i don't wanna run a dedicated farming gearset(except the rifle which is 1 item) but runes of balthazar could be pretty decent
---
unlike that trash wanderer this gives you the option to change some skills and traits and be full dps so stuff like tarir, chak gerent etc don't take forever and you can actually contribute
---
IIRC you can see which license a mount skin comes from by hovering over it in the mount menu.
---
We allready have 3 gimmicky greatswords that look like oversized 2D glowsticks.
---
So it was just logical that we get an actuall legendary now
---
i was thinking other players; one seems to have hellfire shoulders
---
[Vabbi](http://builds.vabbi.org/) has WvW zerg builds but the warrior one hasn't been updated. Metabattle also has [some builds](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Spellbreaker_-_DPS_Spellbreaker) to compare to. Whatever reward tracks you want are fine, there are some that have a better one time only track you can work on or the gift of battle. My best tip for WvW is to find your server's voice chat and follow a good commander. Organised groups in WvW can be a ton of fun.
---
It's hard not to gamble. There are so many easy and fun ways to lose all your gold lmao.
---
I like it as it is :(
---
Yellow WP could be a result of heavy post processing
---
i strongly disagree, you're swapping to proc quickdraw (for a skill that is only worth using an melee range) and sigil of geomancy (also melee range)... therefore; not a ranged build imo
---
I imagine itll be like the roller beatle, or we get it in story.
---
scourge is the only cpds build that can actually stay at range without suffering
---
While you do get a mini Queen Jennah from your first birthday, birthday gifts in Guild Wars 2 are completely different than in Guild Wars 1. 
---
The earlier ones are less impressive, but they get much better as time goes on.
---
I call at least two weeks. We already knows its releasing on a tuesday, since that's arenanet's release day of the week.
---
Wedding attire cuz its worth 1k while the others are 700gems
---

---
This site will come in handy for you.
---
Nice, thanks for the offer but I don't own a steam controller so I'm not sure I could even use your build. I did some research and found out I can actually run the game via steam and edit my ps4 controller to work with the game. It seems like a lot of effort tho so I'll leave it for some other day. Thx again :D
---
It indicates that the next map is probably going to have conquested waypoints like in Orr so you probably need to do some event chains to unlock them again.
---
No e-mail, but got the mask. Same here.
---
There is no "best class" tbh, as long as it isn't condi. 
---
I did completion on my power warrior once, now doing on weaver. Everything just melts.
---
The wiki is probably the most comprehensive source of information, really.
---
The new mount looks like a Griffon reskin tbh. Why just not giving it a new mastery skillset instead?
---
What is wvw?
---
Yes but you control those requests which you are albeit very creepily in such a stalkerish way...
---
I went for the winter monarch outfit!! I remembered really liking it back during the holidays but I didn’t get it at the time. My sylvari tempest boy looks absolutely wonderful in it, and between the outfit, his glittering backpack and staff+scepter, he’s just the sparkliest plant ever and I couldn’t be happier &lt;3
---
World v World
---
player housing (i.e. wildstar's housing) is the last big feature that is missing in GW2.
---
it would fit perfectly in this casual MMO.
---
That would make an interesting balance of life and death, where you draw the line for safety margins and could inspire some interesting meta gaming and skill tests. However it also likely doesn't work as well in group play like raids (however I have no raiding experience in guild wars 2).
---
I don't know. That charr doesn't look that beautiful. It's a nice fur, but he's more on the handsome side.
---
And killed his father?
---
On one hand, they clearly put a lot of effort into it. On the other, giant swords and dragons are just so overdone I can barely stand it. I like GW2 in spite of those elements, not because of them.
---
I'm still salty we're getting another dragon instead of a spider. Spiders aren't too scary, they're just less normalized.
---
Those items have their own preview panel that is very detailed, but you can't open it from the gemstore.
---
That's what I figured the description is about when talking about right-click. There would need to be something similar in the shop.
---
Have another look. If it say just mount select it literally mean the Mount Adoption Licence (the original one). If you mouse over...say Exalted Gate Guardian (the exalted themed raptor) it says "can be acquired from **Exotic Breeds** Mount Adoption Licence".  If it says limited time sale it's one of the expensive single ones (the ones that change how the mount looks completely and are not in packs) or the heavily themed packs that you buy and one for each (like branded or wintersday). 
---
But yeah, it's a bit confusing
---
Nice, only yellow, cyan, brown and graysscale left to have one per dye hue category.
---
Oh ok, so they would just need to correct "mount adoption licence" to "distant lands". 
---
Thanks!

Think I'll probably go awakened zealot - got that Egyptian ninja vibe 🤗
---
You can check in the mounts panel... or am I misunderstanding?
---
I mainly like Deadeye because it isn't super complicated and I can have a more chill experience.
---
Hybrids tend to be a lot harder to pull off, depending on the context of what's being melded, but most tend to lean heavily into one side of the spectrum with the other supplementing. 
---
From a PvE standpoint AoEs aren't a requirement, but they help with tagging mobs for events like World Bosses or farming map events (basically hitting a mob for any amount of damage and being counted as an assist in killing it for potential loot drops). In WvW it depends but having AoE helps a lot for roughly the same reason, but also from an area denial perspective (more or less limiting the amount of space the enemy has to work with unless they want to eat some damage to reposition or burn defensive skills to weather the attacks).
---
Good thing I only play charr
---
They are still subterranean. The only thing that made them again usable was the change that they take reduced damage if not targeted directly. Letting them be affected by conditions but not boons, which are in some way a counter to conditions is illogical. They weren't good before but after the change the only one I see used is the healing one, which gets blasted asap or the rifle one, which seems to be mainly used because of the toolbelt skill not the turret itself.
---
holy crap, 46sec trailer and a 25min youtube video by Woodenpotatoes...
---
How does he do it?
---
Rocket turret can be used in some cheese oneshot holosmith builds. In melee range, rocket from toolbelt hit your targets almost instantly and it hurts a lot.
---
I wish I could find the statement (from about six years ago) where someone from GW2 addressed this saying there would be player housing at some point. It's a huge reason why I actually started playing in the first place. As an old Ultima Online player, housing and all that went with it was a core feature for a deco queen like me.I had fallen in love with the GW2 through the beta tests and knowing housing was coming at some point, made it all the sweeter and pretty much sealed the deal of me staying on as a customer. Now I get my housing fix via Black Desert :/
---
thanks a lot!
---
ded gaem?
---
That tells us nothing. What we do see is special treatment for individual skills where no other weapon in the game does that (besides projectiles). Playing favorites to a few skills feels bad if you use it on a class that wasn't part of the favorites pile.
---
I did not get any confirmation email either. I'm at work so I won't be able to see if I got the mask anyways until later tonight, or when this comment is 11 hours old.
---
Ah heh, sorry. I guess it got me in the feels.
---
The thing is with personal housing is that people will rarely visit your home so it usually ends up as a single-player experience
---
Amazing! I zoomed in and just saw so much detail. This must’ve taken forever. I’ve never seen salads look so good. ;P
---
You can use the time machine on efficiency to see. Basically several of the black lion exclusives dropped off their value for some reason (griffon hatchling backpack, celestial compass focus skin, jackal pup backpack etc).
---
That wasn't even an official War Eternal trailer.. more like a teaser
---
Burst on Quickbrand is just to start with Scepter Focus, use Scepter 2 then Focus 4 5 and switch to Greatsword afterwards.
---
Wedding and Chef outfits are top notch just for racial uniqueness.  
---
Monk and Noble outfits are good "town clothes" alternates.
---
C'mere Princess, I murdered fifty of your siblings you can trust me.
---
&gt;means "Introduction".
---
###LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO MY BLADE
---
ahh okay i see it thank you :)
---
Dude is just passionate.
---
Well, obviously?
---
If you have friends you can show it to them. Otherwise, yeah, you have to put some effort in to make them interesting, I guess. But then there will be housing guilds, spotlights, etc.
---
Aurene's prophecies already came true.
---
Indeed. you eliminated her contenders to the throne. She is the one and only Princess now and will be the only queen when she grows up, with you as her favorite subject. All according to plan.
---
Roll tide.
---
I think the prices were meant to double down on the fact that it's a guild feature. Everyone was supposed to pay part of it. How realistic or useful that is, I dunno.
---
Now yu are the only queen, no one shall challenge yur rule.
---
\#12 here!
---
I think it has something to do with BLC and Chaos weapons returning.
---
Maybe many people saw this chance to sell some rare Chaos weapon skins and they are selling their excess on the market.
---
That’s a great piece of information! At least GW1 so far can be preserves it seems.
---
Yet :)
---
On one hand, he will bring in numbers because of the sheer size of his fanbase (because honestly nobody really watches WoW streams unless it's raid world first races or Asmongold who provides more commentary than anything else), which would be great for the game.   
---
On the other hand, we'll get a mad influx of "big dick dps" bros that don't understand the casual nature of the game and just want to min max it. Which is fine for some modes and at least raids can accommodate that. But that means a less than ideal experience for those that do not take the game serious enough to min max everything.
---
i vote for karka baby to be a recurring character.

---
you mean what you perceive as a date or a request for it
---
And he thinks gw2 is dead :joy: if you watched the video
---
[5:41](https://youtu.be/_sQTjWolEFE?t=343).
---
Ah yeah, here we go again.
---
I just finished the Shining Blade and thought I'd take a break from crafting/farming and get some achievements done.
---
Nevermind.
---
This is very well done, but I feel I should mention that you can craft 2-handed Gen 2 Legs for much cheaper by making [400 off hand shards and converting them to 2-handed shards](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Enormous_Chest_of_Legendary_Shards). It costs more t5 materials but it saves about 200g on the wood and mithril.
---
Yeah, guild wars is just not popular on twitch, i play almost every day and I never even thought about watching stream/yt video, id rather just play the game.
---
Playerbase is decent and healthy
---
The moment he realizes the every GW2 expansion has less content than WoD he's going to uninstall.
---
GW2 is a fun game with great combat but if WoW's content release schedule of roughly 10 raid bosses per 3 months can't keep him engaged then GW2's 3 raid bosses per year certainly won't.
---
Wtf dude
---
f2p players only have core professions, without revenant profession.
---
Expansions offer the revenant profession, as well as new elite specs that give core professions 1 new weapon, 6 new skills and a new profession mechanic.
---
Tho a lot of elite specs are better than core professions, some are even better than other elite specs, there are a few core professions that can still be very powerful in pvp. 
---
Guardians, rangers, some thieves, even core mesmers and necros can still cause trouble if played right in pvp.
---
WvW requires different types of build and has different objectives than spvp. But there are still core professions that can still be pretty useful there as well. 
---
A core staff ele can still support and offer a lot of aoe pressure ,cc and healing for example, but that kind of build wont work in spvp at all

---
So where can I exchange these Extremely precious metals into gold?
---
So, haven't played in a while. Just did Night Of Fires on my Reaper. Got my butt handed to me, but eventually finished.
---
I haven't had that amount of trouble before, especially on my Reaper. Is this mission a ramp up in difficulty or am I just out of practice?
---
[Well, I don't think he will enjoy/play gw2](https://youtu.be/_sQTjWolEFE?t=1573)
---
He's not so much about hardcore raiding, he's not hugely about getting gear upgrades, he's mostly known as a collector, wanting to get all the mounts, all the transmog etc.
---
The raids in wow are actually almost better than ever right now, that's not at all the problem with the game.
---
I think he won't like gw2, but most of that is because there's too much of the top end collector items in the gemstore and black lion chests as opposed to having unique ways to get them.
---
Don't kid yourself - Asmongold himself is not likely to play GW2 even if he may likes parts of it. Definitely not with Classic WoW around the corner.
---
What's net positive is that it showcases the game to many of his viewers who aren't die-hard WoW players and might actually give GW2 a go. 
---
Because why not, Jaw did a good job showcasing the strong points of GW2 and put emphasis on combat system which is currently the biggest pet peeve of BfA.
---
The hero we need.
---
Please no. I've seen him judge ESO by cinematics, and he's obnoxious af. Let this thing die before it even happens.
---
Look the full video where I play GW2. I hope he never comes here.
---
Rambling. A lot.
---
First of I love Ross. The game dungeon is my jam.
---
I watched this video when it came out some week ago, and I know his agenda to stop the industry from killing games etc. But I would like to raise some awareness for one thing that was mentioned in a gw1 AMA I wanna say a year or so ago. Maybe two.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars/comments/83beji/ama_ask_scw_about_guild_wars/dvgsl4s/
---
Now sure it's no guarantee that it will actually run forever. But judging by this and 5~ year old articles, it seems that Guildwars is so cost effective that it could likely be around longer than we are. Especially with the hero system etc there isn't really even a need for it to have players to be playable. Since you can solo anything almost.
---
So personally I wouldn't worry about GW1, GW2 is another dime though since we know nothing about it really. Just thought I'd shed some light on the GW1 part atleast.
---
I used most of them to open unids before the recent change, now I guess they're back to stockpiling....
---
Exactly, he could just swipe his credit card and get all the mount skins. GW2's reward structure doesn't reward people for investing time, but investing money.
---
Ah, a man of culture.
---
Zero chance he'll be streaming it. Not enough viewers.
---
&gt; almost always someone around to ping all of their legendaries in map right after.
---
...followed by Dandelions and Porous Bones.
---
I use TacO to help spot bandit chests during RIBA farming.
---
Well, keep in mind that GW2's community is this 'good' because the game essentially forces them to be this good.
---
If you really want to be a PK troll killing newbies as they leave the starting zones, or a kill-stealer, or  a node ninja, or any other nasty behavior that is simply impossible in GW2, you won't be able to do that in GW2, so you either leave or stop trying and enjoy the game like the rest.
---
The best way to prevent bad behaviors is making them impossible.
---
I'm sure this was all a karka ploy involving murder and deceit among a dwindling monarchic system.
---
51th in line to the crown, you say? Let's fix that.
---
Looks like it. In GW2 one gets better through practice and experience, not through grind.
---
He doesn't like that GW2's combat is so action-based that players who invest more time do become better than players who don't, but not because of getting better gear, but because they become more skilled, like in other games in which personal performance is less dependent on gear, like RTSs, fighting games and shooters.
---
If one wants a game in which time and grind alone translates in half of your additional power from where you started, GW2 is not that game.
---
Sometimes I think your Asura is a bookah in disguise.
---
And yet I still watch every one.
---
She will rumble about her aspirations to the crown now and then.
---
Krystals - now part of this complete breakfast!
---
- Month 6: becomes Sylvari
---
- Month 7: becomes a german citizen in his early 60s
---
- Month 8: becomes a superhero
---
Well, that's smart advertising, that's for sure.
---
Same as the hammer.
---
"Thank you, I will forget I have it then put it in my bank forever."
---
"I don't believe that"..
---
This guy juge the game with ONE video. We dont need him. He understand nothing of what he is watching.
---
&gt; From the moment he could walk, Bowmark has trained for a fight to the death. The Disc awaits him: **a giant bronze platform suspended over a river of lava.** He dreads the day of proving—when he must kill or be killed—to claim the throne.
---
This sounds so much like SAB lol.
---
Why
---
I am too scared to click
---
Why not
---
Any healer is easy mode.
---
Nice... So greatsword and axe/wh?
---
Magenta text on a cyan background? Wtf?
---
&gt; who invest more time do become better than players who don't, but not because of getting better gear
---
Ye but you know what? Everything in PvE is time gated, you of course can clear all raid wings few times per day but you're not going to get rewarded and it's gonna suck because you cannot create a fresh instance yourself.
---
Yea or greatsword and axe focus if you prefer that. Warhorn has cc, focus has booncorrupt
---
Haven't moved past the Human Tier 2 on my main for about 5 years now.  There is no better Ranger armor in the game.
---
he wants vertical progression so there is not chance he would enjoy gw2 plus he seems too far gone into WoW
---
Points are points I guess! xD
---
Some zones definitely feel dead, but I wouldn't say any of the expansion zones feel that bad. They already are addressing some of the PoF Zone issues with the upcoming Meta improvements. And while there may not be tons of players there at unpopular times, I still see a fair amount of players in the maps even outside of the LFG squads doing bounties or such.
---
And I'd disagree that saying it is okay for a collection to be harder post-release because there aren't 1000s of players all working on it is gatekeeping and asking for the game to die. Everything will be less popular a year later than it is on release, but it doesn't mean it will be dead or impossible to do. Even if there aren't dozens of players who happen to be working on it when you're there and you have trouble doing it solo, you can ask other players for help or join a Guild; that is more what an MMO is about than expecting there to be players doing everything all the time.
---
And can you name one achievement or event focused armor or weapon skin that is impossible to get months or years later? Dungeons aren't as popular as they were at launch, but you can easily find a group for them. HoT metas like Verdant Brink aren't as active as they were on release, but you will still find players doing them successfully unless you go at really dead times. PoF Maps aren't super popular, but there are still commanders running bounty trains. So saying "I hope the new armor coming with the next story update is more to do with achievements and events than throwing a bunch of money at it is" is far from gatekeeping new players. Just the other month I was finishing some of the HoT specialization weapon collections and despite being years later I had no issue completing them (except Sanctum Sprint because I'm terrible at Sanctum Sprint), so more item collections like that are not as bad of a thing as you're making it out to be.
---
weeeeell, lore-wise we needed sigils of nullification to nullify the effects of armor experiments, or something along those lines. :d i agree that it inflated the price waaay too much, but as i said, its a gold sink, and it gave me a long term goal, so i just cant mind it too much, yknow. 
---
it sounds to me like you dont mind gold sinks you dont care about, but if a gold sink is attached to an item you like, it becomes a problem. im not trying to be rude, btw, just observing and uhh..having conversation?
---
Just do it my fellow Pikeman. Show anet some love and just play some more :)
---
On my Guardian, every piece of armor is broken and still haven't completed the mission, it's hard. My tactic eventually is kite the enemies one by one and eliminate them.
---
We triggered the fanboys xD
---
Bought it. Hopefully won't have to return it.
---
yeah! we have aurorapeachy to react to things!
---
Basicslly, if I undeestsnd this correctly, add these IPs to limit the number of third parties you're handing out your information (session, clicks, PIi, etc.) to for "market research purposes."
---
I try not to because if Im diligent about using my daily acended mat eaters I can get it down to a managable level. Unfortunately Im not very diligent. I probably should start destroying the dragonite ores though, its the only one thats gotten out of control because Anet didn't want to change around node types for season 4 maps.
---
As in "What is this crap mirage? It died to burning under 4 seconds, I demand a real challenge!"?
---
Right after rifle deadeye hits you for 15k out of stealth and immediately re-stealths. Do you have 100% reflect uptime? Well, his stealth is basically unlimited so.... ;)
---
Pretty sure a Charr can give full consent if they want it. Your average housecat, on the other hand, cannot. Also good chance your housecat wouldn't even know what's going on, and would be very traumatized.
---
I do not means that
---
I like my game the way I like my women - no addons on it.
---
what about bad healer?
---
You got a mouse in your pocket? Because there's no 'we' between you and me.
---
ty XD
---
no, I am saying about some people told me high damage mitigation and healing = mm condi healing reaper
---
Hold onto it. If you want to get rid of it, play PvP and get the free ones from there and you can get an almost-free piece of armor. The good thing about the marks is that they can be used in a variety of vendors so you're not locked into fractals or PvP or whatever.
---
well, the elegy collection was like that, the requiem one was a big "upgrade", something like lunar and stellar weapons before it, and dragonsblood weapons after it, all second "upgrade" collections are very expensive.
---
i think the new armors are gonna be like that too, so you know what to expect this time. :)
---
"Implying 80% of the people logged in are actually playing"
---
What rifle is that?
---
I would prefer the static charge holosmith build. Static charge bounces/tags multiple foes and you can even fire them off when knocked down/disabled.
---
&gt; one-handed
---
off-handed. important distinction.
---
Are you able to use Arcdps alongside this setup?
---
My favorite build lately has been [condi meta event support tempest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsDFJbabNTc). I don't have renegade runes on my armor just because they're expensive and I don't care THAT much. I run Balthazar runes and never really run into problems. It's the perfect build for me in that I don't have to worry about attunement-swapping or doing anything other than pressing all my buttons and remembering a couple of my skills can do things like stack might. Unless I wade into a swarm of tough enemies, I never feel really pressured either. I put Rebound as my elite to save myself and other people in meta events, but otherwise it's what the video talks about. For tagging a boss, most of the time you literally just need to fire off your signet of fire and go help somewhere else. It burns for a lot in an AoE around your target! Also, your scepter autos do a good job of tagging if you tab-target. You can also swap out a skill for something like Firestorm for another big AoE. But usually, I just run into a group doing fire overload and I've tagged basically everything. ALSO, if you feel like it, the AoE heal on water overload is not something to sneeze at, even without healer gear. Just a generally good build. That channel has a whole series on a bunch of good open world builds, too.
---
There's already so many of them. But yeah I cant wait to see the possibilites the new mount might offer!
---
bruh...
---
That is likely due to issues with your protection uptime or eating damage so learning mechanics and ensuring you run stone spirit may help. Failing that, you could run Minstrel gear in fractals as Druid due to no toughness based aggro. Obviously this set is less suitable for raids and things should be more than manageable with harrier gear.
---
Q.Q
---
Same reason why people play Fashion Wars: To spend gold and a ridiculous amount of time to create something they are proud of and show off to other people. 
---
FF14 and Wildstar went about it in different ways: In FF14 you decorate primarily the interior of the house, while in Wildstar you primarily decorated the exterior since you had an enormous plot of land but relatively small house.
---
One of the major draws is that it opens up a whole new realm of both functional and cosmetic goals to aim for. Potential sources of furniture/decorations:
---
- Dungeons
---
- Fractals
---
- Raids
---
- World Bosses/expansion meta events
---
- Certain uncommon meta events
---
- Jumping Puzzles
---
- Collections
---
- Achievements (e.g. The *Drake Slayer* achievement could reward a stuffed/wandering Drake decoration, progressive bronze/silver/gold Drake statue or model, mounted Drake head, etc.)
---
- Heart vendors
---
- Map currency vendors (HoT, LS3, PoF, LS4 maps)
---
- Pact Supply Agents
---
- Scribing 
---
- Festival events
---
- Adventures
---
- PvP/WvW
---
- Decoration versions of your crafted Legendary weapons/armour
---
- Place a set amount of mini pets/ranger pets, or one of each mount
---
Then there's the more practical side of things:
---
- Placing all of your daily nodes relatively close to each other
---
- Portal/s to cities/maps (+ World Bosses if you own the gemstore portal devices)
---
- Daily minigames for rewards (e.g. Wildstar's small plot-based minigames... Simon says, making moonshine, a vertical spire jumping puzzle...)
---
- Rested XP Bonus that can be set to one of the three game regions (Core/HoT/PoF) to help people still working on Masteries
---
- Other resting bonuses? Bonus karma for *x* amount of minutes after logging in, or bonus resource chance, WvW XP, etc...
---
- Friends'/Public housing allowing you to visit others' houses and use their gathering nodes at any time
---
While FF14 has active neighbourhood districts, it really only works due to regular servers. Wildstar's system would suit megaservers better, where each plot is instanced but you can set privacy restrictions based on friends/"neighbour" groups/public preferences.
---
Plus there's all the bonuses of it being a massive gold sink and material sink, giving people reason to go back to old maps to run events/hearts, and obvious gemstore profits for ANet... Selling deluxe decorations, unique ground/sky/weather presets, plot and housing styles, or certain niche features like having your other characters actively walk around the plot and interact with things.
---
There's a huge amount of potential for player housing... The main issue, imo, is ANet's track record of half-assing new systems, or implementing a system only to never touch it again.
---
mesmer in general offer portals, reflects, and stealth. 
---
They can also offer some strong cc and various boons to their party.
---
minstrel stats are ..tanky/healer soooo...you cant expect to deal massive aoe dmg with that
---
Rule over whom though?
---
&gt; Banner. Place a banner that increases in size. 
---
Hulk banner.
---
This is quite frankly hilarious.
---
Thank you good sir.
---
You will need to stay within 300 range of target to get the healing but it is also a 10% damage boost
---
You mean you have eternity, I presume?
---
I think player housing falls under the same category as life skills, where they just serve to make the game feel more immersive from a role playing perspective. It can give people more options to be who they want to be, if they don't want to just be the commander all the time
---
For some people, sometimes you want to be in game, maybe you have friends or a guild, or you just really like the atmosphere, or whatever, but you don't actually want to be playing the combative parts of the game. You'd rather be doing something relaxing, decorating a house, fishing (another asked for concept), or something like that, than just sitting around afk
---
And in other cases, things like housing can be a personal record of your own achievements. Similar to guild hall decorations, but it's more of a personal record that you can sometimes just reflect on privately
---

Keep in mind that it takes up to 8 weeks after april 29th to distribut the item. That's what they said, when they announced the giveaway.
---
Nobody ever came to my house in wildstar unless they were using my raid portal and I still loved decorating it and building stuff. I know a lot of people felt the same way about it. /shrug

I built a lake on my housing plot. It was pretty awesome, even if I never finished it.

I thought this is 'bannable.'

I only play it for the things gw2 doesn’t have: housing and a rewarding economy.
---
The combat is what keeps me playing gw2 but the economy in FFXIV isn’t fucked so that keeps me playing that.
---
I think its not, correct me if im wrong
---
No. Tldw: he bashes the game except for wvw
---
bottom one looks like cookie monster
---
Gotta agree with you. Right now the game is funded by casual whales, as much as the tiny, vocal elitist types might like to argue against it. I foresee the game quickly losing a lot of those casuals (and money) if the "nice" (easygoing, carefree, helpful) community became consumed by the toxic Blizzard types. I used to think League was toxic but Blizzard fanbases take the cake after playing OW, HotS, WoW...they can slowly bleed over from WoW and when they're dickbags here get told off by mapchat and reform to this title, but a huge rush of them all at once? No thank you.
---
Housing will come, it's the next big step after mounts.
---
I frequently bullshit about this game but the teaser was pretty informative and W.P. is a great community figure.
---
This is awesome but her foot in the air... I don't understand that anatomy? Maybe it's just me.
---
i actively dislike twilight/sunrise.  twilight a little less so, but the overall sword shape just looks terrible.
---
If Requiem was a set of Ascended Armor, I'd have no complaints about cost and expect it to cost more. I agree that we could use an Ascended Armor collection; perhaps the upcoming set might be Ascended for the higher tier.
---
Low skill floor != non-existent high skill ceiling.
---
You sound like you're exactly where I was at when I started training. Dragonhunter, know rotation, ascended trinkets, 2 ascended weapons in my case, mostly exotic armor except one piece ascended. Find a raid training guild and see what they expect of you, but in a lot of cases you should be set. I'd recommend watching/reading guides for encounters before trying them, but in my guild even that wasn't expected. Keep working towards ascended for sure, but unless your guild specifically requests it, you shouldn't need it to start training.
---
Guild Hall decorating and private housing is just too different to be combined in one. You could have arguments about space, you could lose your house when getting kicked from the guild, you will have performance issues giving everyone a house inside the hall.. etc.
---
Yo! How about having mannequins in your housing, and you can dress these mannequins with high-end gear you acquired throughout your journey.
---
This is Fashion Wars 2 after all, so we need mannequins!
---
I recommend everyone to check youtube for Wildstar player created housing plots. They are mindblowing, creative and so much effort went into them.
---
A lot of the gen2 isn't just a goldgate though, there are a lot of different things you'll need to do so always worth getting started now and saving as you complete it bit by bit

To answer some of the questions. Peerblock was evolved(derived) from PeerGuardian. It is an old and reliable technology date back couple decades ago.
---
-
---
When one run the program, one can let the program stay open(or check log file). One can observe all the ip(s) blocked(or allowed).
---
If one run only GW2, one can see all th ip(s) GW2 tries to connect to.
---
Since blocking UK government IP(s) has no effect on running GW2, they are blocked.
---
Pure speculation, governments are not rich enough to hire good quality security engineers. They thought they could get some info of terrorists using GW2 as a mean to transfer information. Trust me, there are billions of much better ways.
---
Why doesn't GW2 send out one's info from their end? Litigation? Public outcry? You are consent/agree to send them out? I am not going to read the fine print of the agreement. I just block them all(including MS).
---
Some other MMOs just ban my playing their games, because I block their Chinese IP(s)/Russia IP(s)... I just deleted them. So what.
---
Like my title said. Someone run peerblock can save lot of time with this list. It is a growing list. Whenever I visit a new area, new ip(s) pop up.
---
I just started ~6 weeks ago and I'm loving it.  I used to be a hardcore MMO player but I simply don't have the time for that type of gameplay anymore.  I can't spend 4 nights a week raiding and such so this is the perfect MMO for me right now.  I can jump in and out and feel like I'm progressing towards something.  Or simply just playing for fun.  It's great!
---
welcome back. a LOT has changed in 6 years, not just the added new content but loads of QoL changes and balance paches and new elite specs as well
---
DO NOT DELETE your old characters, every year on the day they were created you will get a bday present and the older the character is the cooler the rewards are!
---
* lvl 80 booster will leave you with a lvl 80 character with basic soldier (tanky power based but no critical chance) gear, AND you will STILL have no idea what to do with the character or their skills. BUT you can use the lvl 80 booster (once) for a temporary trial, you only "consume" the booster if you use it twice.
---
* all gold and most other currencies are in your acc wide wallet. Mounts, like other masteries (such as gliding) are unlocked once ,account wide, and further upgrades to them are also account wide. Only ascended gear are account wide and those gear that havent been bound. But in all honesty, you can get a set of berserkers gear (still the best option for a full glass cannon build) exotic gear from the TP for like ,maybe 15-20 gold,which can  farmed rather easy buy doing just about anything in the game.
---
* End game,as in raids, are available to expansion users only. HoT has currently most of the raid bosses and encounters. Expansions also let you use their masteries and their elite specializations. Elite specs are 1 specialization trait line (core professions have 5 and can use up to 3). When you fully unlock an elite spec and you equip it, you get 1 new weapon, 6 new skills and your core profession mechanic changes. An example would be dragon hunter (guardian), they get a longbow, 6 new traps, and their 3 virtues turn into a throwable spear that you can pull an enemy towards you, a long leap with a pair of wings, and a brief,but persistant wall inr font of you that blocks all attacks to you and anyone standing behind you.
---
* You can also consider fractals as end game as well considering the amount of new ones, as well as massive changes to their rewards, and mechanics. 
---
A great way to get back into is indeed the lvl 80 booster.
---
If you use it once on a non lvl 80 character, you will enter trial mode. You can use trial mode for unlimited time on any amount of characters (even new fresh ones).
---
Trialmode is basically you being temporary boosted to lvl 80, with exotic gear, and a premade build (that you can change any way you wish), but you are stuck inside silverwaste zone.
---
Silverwaste zone is the last zone added way back at the end of season 2 living world story, and it represents what most of gw2 pve is right now. Open world, full of chained meta events that phase on night/day, massive bosses, loads of loot, participation loot, 1 type of key, 1 type of zone currency, 1 type of chest you can open with keys you buy with zone currency, as well as a new set of armor/weapon skins.
---
You can keep creating an unlimited amount of characters, with different races and professions and try the core ones in the boosted trial mode. You can even equip the loot you get and try out a different weapon or build entirely. 
---
While you do this you will learn what profession you have most fun with, learn more about that one and other professions , gain tons of loot that you can sell or salvage for profit, gain loads of rare or exotic gear for your new char or more profit.

---
Unacceptable racism.
---
Sorry for bringing you down from the rainbow once again but: this game simply wasn't built having player housing in mind. The basic problem in GW2 is that player housing would require loading player data ad hoc inside map which already is an instance - if there's a way to bypass, then we can have a player housing system. The closest thing they may provide us is a house instance that is loaded upon entering existing house model anywhere around on Tyria (let's say all these little houses in Village of Shaemoor of Queensdale or in Wizard's Fief on Kessex Hills could be the player's houses); Sun's Refuge from S4E4 is larger scale example how such feature could look like in GW2 
---
People including myself still had too high expectations regarding Sun's Refugee before it was released: there were wishes and dreams of home instance upgrades carried to the new place, bookshelves for all book items we collected, decorations support etc.; we all know how this ended up like so far - but who knows, maybe there's little hope that devs will expand this instance.
---
Hmmm. I'm going to struggle to recommend anything other than full Berserker's gear for both. 
---
You'll find a lot of people on this subreddit suggesting you swap some Zerker gear out for something like Marauder's for more HP/survivability. And they'll likely call me elitist for suggesting that's a bad idea.
---
I probably am slightly elitist, but, it's not elitism that has me recommending the full glass cannon.
---
It's just the matter of how little having even an extra ~5K HP matters when compared to how much easier this game is when you can just do the damage needed to kill something faster. The sacrifice in DPS needed to gain enough tank stats to make a difference is just...not worth it.
---
Think of it this way. Say it takes you 2 minutes to kill a boss in full berserker gear. If you get enough tank stats to gain 50% more HP, now it might take you 5-6 minutes to kill that boss. So, yeah, you've got 1.5x more HP, but now you have to fight the boss 3x longer than you did before. So it's more time for you to make a mistake, get hit by an attack, etc. Whereas if you just do the damage and kill the boss quickly, you'll have to deal with far fewer mechanics. The trade off just isn't worth it, in my opinion.
---
And then swapping out like 1 or two pieces for a very minimal amount of extra HP is just...meh. I mean, say you gain another 1K HP. How many times do you find yourself still alive with 1K HP? Normally if you're that low, you're dead anyway. It's more useful to learn how to not get hit and avoid the damage altogether than try and tank it. So again you're just sacrificing damage for not a lot of gain.
---
Honestly, Berserker Gear is pretty cheap. I recommend just giving the Snow Crows builds a go. I expect you might be surprised at how much easier the game is when things just *die* before they can kill you first.
---
If you're that concerned, and you already enjoy Reaper, gear that first. It will definitely be more forgiving. But truly learn Reaper. Try your hardest to learn how to hit at least 30K burst on the golem, and hold like 20K DPS. If you can do that, you're already ahead of like 95% of Reapers, and that shouldn't be too hard.
---
But really I'd say discard any inhibitions about T4s being too difficult for you or wanting a crutch with tank stats. I truly believe it will be harder to ultimately learn how to do it with building tank than it would be just to learn how to do good DPS and watch things melt under your Greatsword.
---
God dang. Respect dude.
---
Gz and well done
---
They should go back to the sea where they belong. Land is for the land dwellers!
---
I know. I don't expect anything else from this subreddit. What I've said is true and nobody has ever given counter arguments and tried to prove gw2 has challenging content or competition. It's for a certain demographic (unfortunately, because it's a waste of the awesome combat system), but I think some people want to pretend otherwise
---
Only new playable races and player housing left. Both are bound to happen sooner or later.
---
This should be possible already, considering there's a "statue system" where your own character can be used as a decoration.
---
Only available in the PvP hub for now, but shows it can be done.

I'm at 98% :D just need the gift of metal, everything else is ready!

This is fair, but I feel like the number of decorations you want is likely to scale with the number of people in your guild, at least for guilds on the small size
---
That land was underwater before, you took it from us in the first place!
---
I think we should keep in mind that gen2 legendary weapons rarely have anything to do with the LS or even the episode they come with. 
---
Sharur and the Shining Blade came with LS3 EP6. The map was Orr and we fought Lazarus by using the "original" Shining Blade. That's pretty much it. The Shining Blade actually is the only legendary which had anything to do with the story it came with. 
---
I don't say it's not possible that Exordium will have anything to do with the next episode, but I think it's unlikely and we shouldn't interpret too much into it.
---
Hi, is there a way to get someone from somewhere to help me get started on fractals? Im a bit afraid to go into them by myself with complete strangers, but having a guiding hand would be nice, but who do i contact and where for that?
---
There's still a chance they try a different approach and like it, but anyone who comes here looking for a faithful WoW substitute will be heavily disappointed.
---
Tons of people share your opinion, you're not edgy.
---
I hope it'll take place in the new map!

You don't need a gift of exploration, do you?

The reason why people tend to watch streams of their favourite games (before maybe finding a person they end up enjoying to watch for personality or whatever) is because they like to see people better than them at a game and seeing what can be achieved with greater skill. In GW2 there is no content that is hard to get through, and the competitive playerbases of pvp and wvw have been destroyed as Anet has put 0 effort into them while continuing to market the game for a very casual playerbase. Hence, there is 0 reason to watch.
---
It's not surprising that some of the most viewed streamers on twitch are people like teapot or pvpers.
---
It's not what I'd recommend for someone wanting to "speed through the hearts and everything else" though. Minionmancer necro is almost unstoppable for sure, but things hit so weakly and die so quickly in open world that I don't feel there's any need to be that survivable when you could just plow through everything twice as fast with any other class instead. (On the flipside, though, the fact that things do die so fast means you might not notice necro's slowness as much because everything kills fast.)
---
Pretty beautiful art, congratulations.

Would the Guardian suddenly become naked upon selecting this "Monk" traitline, as the transition from Heavy to Light armor in Preview Mode instantly and completely disrobes a character.

&gt;Toss elixir b at a location, dealing damage in an area, then teleport &gt;back to your pet, granting you the ability to trade and converse
---
Beastmaster engi elite spec confirmed?
---
new players that don't understand that requesting a monk would involve 5 norn loosing all their clothes in the blink of an eye is a pretty funny thought tho
---
Go to change game modes from PvE to WvW and haven't yet set up your traitlines...suddenly naked. Whoops.
---
For PoF what I personally would have implemented a type of legendary item, possibly a "legendary style" mount skin pack. This could be obtained as a "completionist" reward of PoF; 100% map completion, story completion with all achievements, completion of all content PoF has to offer in addition to new collection achievements that span across every map.  
---
For LWS5 I hope they add something like Aurora. LWS4 had a similar problem with incentives, although not as pronounced since they had the ascended jewelry, until they added this.  
---
But until then they need to add something to keep players engaged longer with each release. They can't wait until the end of the season to add something like this. I'm having trouble thinking of what they could do in the meantime, and it has to do with the nature of the maps.  
---
The problem is that while the maps are fancy on the outside, they have good scenery, music, ambient character, they are hollow in the inside. Their activities and content itself lacks substance.  
---
This makes it difficult to implement other types of long term goals. For instance, in more meta-focused maps the meta can be made a centerpiece, with an entire collection built around it that requires many completions, maybe leading into a larger collection that provides an infusion. But in a map with content that lacks face replay value, nobody is going to find this fun to repeat that content. Nobody for example, is going to enjoy repeating hearts 100 times.
---

doesnt change the point that SB suffers greatly from not being melee range
---
i dont think anyone would enjoy doing the same thing over and over again. completionist achiev is a cool idea, but it offers no replayability the moment you finish it. i just dont think its possible to make that happen, the only way to get people to visit older maps is to add new content all the time. something like current events, but slightly more complex, and this upcoming world boss event. these are the only way to make old content interesting again, in my opinion.
---
&gt;Still find it funny people will watch others play a game.
---
I watch football, no reason why I wouldn't watch video game, to be fair.
---
Is this also worth doing for 1H weapons as well?
---
I remember several posts regarding map complétion speedruns and most of those were running power chronomancer (vanilla mesmer should work as well).
---
Sword 2 is one of the highest bursty skills in the game, you have access to portals/mimic which can be used to fill some hearts faster as well as a wide array of usefull open World skills.
---
Mounts made the run much faster and the position rewinder (ls4ep2) can come in handy as well.
---
We don't know just yet. Hopefully before May ends.

Things I stumbled upon halfway through crafting Spero (step 3 of Pharus). Now my go-to method, but man I wish I had known before going out and harvesting literally thousands of Elder Wood Saplings and Mithril Ore Nodes.
---
Calm down, it's not about investing five full raidclears a day. That's not the only measurement of time spent in a game.
---
But hey, if someone *does* want to do that just to get the practice in, I say more power to them. Imagine wanting to get better at something, with the only reward being... well, getting better, instead of crying because you're not getting another loot box.
---
&gt; people are generally pretty easy-going in T1. 
---
Just want to really emphasize this point right here, you really get two kinds of people in T1
---
1) People who have already completed T4 and are doing T1 for certain achievements or to train people
---
2) People who are, like you, working their way out of T1
---
The enemies are easy in T1, so much that your real only concern is dealing with the actual mechanics of the fractals, which just take time and practice to get used to. But many people, like you, are just trying to get a grasp of how fractal mechanics work, so mistakes are not really punished by the group.
---
Not really, the payout is much smaller because you "lose" 25 shards in the conversion. It's cheaper to make the off-hand weapons for the 2-hand weapons because 2-hand weapons use almost exactly double the resources the off-hand weapons use, but 1-hand weapons only use slightly more and you lose that difference when converting.
---
May I ask what's your build?
---
What is the item next to Gift of the Mists? And what are the two next to the Deldrimor Steel Greatsword Hilt?  
---
I have everything else, but I don't recognize those items.
---
No, not really. The outcome is roughly the same :)
---
If you think that large groups of players of a certain mentality won't impact your play experience at all, then you're either delusional or very naive. There's a reason that certain gaming communities have a reputation for being a certain way (in general), and it's *entirely* because of the type of player that the  particular game attracts. 
---
And that's not necessarily a bad thing in and of itself. Not every game should be for more casual-minded folks, after all. But the attitude of the playerbase around you will *absolutely* impact your own enjoyment of the game, whether you like it or not.
---
(And yes, I say "large groups of players" because the post you're replying to specifically said "those kinds of players", not just this one guy.)
---
&gt; This effect will now purchase components needed to heal yourself and launch. 
---
We are finally pay to win!
---
I think it would be the same as we have with weapons. If you already wear it, you keep your heavy armor, but can't "use" it -&gt; it gives you no stats. If you don't wear it, you are not able to equip it. 
---
As an addition there would be a restriction that you have to unequip all you heavy pieces before you are able to equip the light ones, to avoid armor mixing. 
---
Or the heavy armor would be invisible to avoid armor mixing.
---
Visionary inscription I think and 4 enormous chests of legendary shards
---
Yay :) I did see the google spread sheet post but i didn’t look in detail at it. I wasn’t aware it pointed out the gold you can save doing the mf recipe :c so I made a post. Thanks for appreciation tho!
---
hah nice try mirage scum but your illusion skills wont work on me.
---
The armors itself wouldn't be that bad if there are several stages of them like the Requiem- armor has, which means a version without that crystals would be way more fitting.
---
Crafting the precursor weapons tends to require 13 of a material. Not always, but it's usually a low number. Though for charged quartz crystals, making 13 would require 325 quartz crystal to make with a daily cooldown per crystal. I'm not sure if ArenaNet would do that to us or not so I'm hoping it'll only require regular quartz crystal, if not something else.
---
The griffon is faster though. It was compared to a jet wheras the skyscale is closer to a helicopter.
---
It still worked out for me, just something to be mindful of in the future! Shards of Friendship or Shards of the Dark Arts took less than half the time to make all the same, and I've been supplementing the remainder I need for Pharus with Laurel purchases.
---
If that happens they have my gold for the rest of the game's lifetime, it's just that I'm not expecting it. But you're right, if they can precisely prove that Living World can pull out  content on the level an expansion would, they can even think of retiring the concept of expansions and carrying on with their season model. It'd even be considered groundbreaking, somewhat
---

Community is not a single person tho? I may watch someone just because he's entertaining not because I feel like I share similar values with given person. Watching gay streamer doesn't mean I'm  gay. Being a friend with a smoker doesn't make me one. Also nobody can force you to communicate with people you do not wish to communicate with. If you think they shouldn't play the game because they do not fit your perfect community, then in fact, you're the toxic one. The game gives you the options to deal with it.
---
&gt; "competitive" (read: assholish)
---
I don't really understand this? If you think people are assholes because of competitiveness that I'm really sad for you. Or if you think that competitiveness creates toxicity then I'm sad for you even more.
---
Come to mag if you like to pvp m8 lots of new and returning players that can help anyone get the most of wvw.
---
&gt; I don't really understand this? If you think people are assholes because of competitiveness that I'm really sad for you.
---
There's a reason i put it in quotation marks. I mean "competitive" in the sense that this streamers sole reason to play games seems to be that he wants to be better at others at it. Which may be fine in WoW, but runs counter to the basic design choices of GW2. And people with this sort of mindset don't go out of their way to be helpful or nice, in my experience.

---
Ah, thank you very much. I don't plan to craft that since there's always a chance it won't be needed (mind you there's a chance some of the other things won't be either). Didn't recognize the item and was getting concerned that I had missed something crucial.  
---
Much appreciated.

## “War Eternal” Arrives this May
---
I just started playing too!! Never had so much fun 🖤
---
I contacted support a while ago about the confirmation email and they had said that they were changing it so that you no longer needed to receive the confirmation email in order to receive the mask, just subscribe. Be patient for those who haven't received it yet and got no confirmation email, they did say it may take up to 8 weeks after April 29.
---
It's not like I do not want to do that, the problem is ANet do not want me to do that. There's literally no support showed from anet for people who want to play raids more than once a week or fractals that aren't dailies. People asked for manual instance reset (even without rewards) since raids came out and they didn't do anything about that for almost 4 years.
---
If you're gonna go for vision of the mist and phantasm weapons in general, id suggest trying Glint's Gaze. Its closer to the pink-ish shades of the weapons than the purple gaze is. Just my opinion however. Character looks good!
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/war-eternal-arrives-this-may/
---
Brings back memories when turrets werent affected by conditions. Bunker engi in pvp was plain dumb but it was so much fun to be able to sit on a cap point and turtle there until the end of times.
---
 &gt; Idk what elitism has to do with time spend in-game
---
 &gt; You think that people who play 3 to 7 days every 3 months fund the game for everyone else
---
I mean you brought up how often us "casuals" play, you made it seem like "hardcore" gamers (I'd assume you're meaning to say raiders explicitly here?) are the ones floating the game, and yet I provided a personal example of how much I spend per month in the game.
---
You want to argue semantics or do you want to actually support your argument?
---
I remember the ad saying to give them something like 6 weeks from the date you had to be subbed by to get them all distributed. They're probably sending the confirmation emails out in batches as well as the masks.
---
&gt; Dodge while stunned and then press 1.
---
This can be done only if you take elusive mind in the mirage trait line which comes with exhaustion as I said. I only commented for this, for the others I partly agree.
---
As for being able to dodge while ccd, yeah that is possible. But this entire change was core of mirage elite, the only thing they changed with the elite was dodging you know, like different specs got something new, with mirage core class changed the dodging, you gain ambush skills while gaining mirage cloak, how is the easiest way to gain the cloak? Dodging! 
---
If it's any comfort mirage evade timing on dodge was nerfed by (25% iirc) two patches back..yeah detarget is one of the problems, but I play mesmer so much I can near about always tell which the real one is lol.
---
I agree detarget is one biggest boon. However it is kinda absolutely necessary, in fact I am keeping one target break because I play power shatter as I don't have axe 3. The need? For some reason even on using torch 4 for stealth ranger autos and long bow 2 seems to follow me for some reason. I dunno if it's in their trait line or has been a bug?  But it is kinda absolutely necessary to equip reflect and detarget as WvW is getting ridiculous with this.
---
haunted armor for my charr firebrand, set the ghosty parts to blue and i can pretend im a spirit
---
In line to be the next karka queen:
---
Princess: "No, I insist, you can go ahead of me."
---
And repeat, where she remains the pampered princess forever. She's got it all figured out.
---
You can swap to ranked. Much better rewards, and it doesn’t have Djinn’s Dominion in rotation.
---
There is some similarity, like the blue. And having a mouth and eyes.
---
well, people are already playing content they enjoy the most - pvp, wvw, fracs, raids..im not sure how would you make those more..replayable? what youre saying is that we need some sort of open world fractalish type of content or simply just more hot metas for people who dont do anything else but open world stuff? i mean..yeah, pof metas suck, and i still do hot metas sometimes. i guess world events are the best thing we can get. maybe youre just feeling burnt out? i just think developing games isnt that easy at all and no matter what anet does, someones not gonna be happy about it.
---
No worries, I agree the particular shades of purple between the newly released purple visage and the phantasm set don't match. My Revenant utilizes Reaver of the Mists for his Axe skin and the purple energy from Legendary Demon stance doesn't at all match the purple of that Axe. All the same, this purple mask will be closer than any of the other available masks lol
---
If you actually read the guide and not just look at the build itself you will see that a lot of bosses SC recommended Mace over Axe for additional healing on higher pressure fights such as Matthias.
---
On SC, you are doing yourself a MASSIVE disservice by not reading the guide sections.  The build is just a general setup but the guide explains the reasoning beyond the trait, gear and skill choices and gives an overview on how to use the class on the relevant encounters.
---
We don't owe *you* anything! That happened generations ago, between our great ancestors!
---
In fact, you probably owe *us* for Lion's Arch! And Droknar's Forge, and the Temple of the Ages, and am I forgetting anything?
---
&gt;Shattering Blow ... Melee
---
it isnt (though i do agree that cdps zerker suffers outside of melee range)
---
&gt;Scourge
---
&gt;Torch 4
---
harrowing wave is 600 range, nothing like ranger SB2s effective range (except on massive hitboxes)
---
&gt;AoE elite
---
this you have a point on; but scourge is still by far the least hampered 'ranged' cdps
---
It's all speculation at this point but to be fair WP's speculations are usually on point.
---
at least you got the outfit xd many people got nothing, they ran out of codes really quick (plus ppl outside of the US weren't even eligible)
---
Yeah my mesmer uses only phantasm weapons. The only glowy stuff I manage to make fit kinda well are the glowy dragon horns, foefire's clothing and chaos gloves. Usually with Glint's Rebellion or something similar, depending on the clothing's material.
---
I'm only using toolbox as a chat filter because the game spams me with irrelevant bullsh*t about random players D:
---
He's talking about overlapping circles
---
Player housing should be right on the main path of home instance so when people ask for invite to go harvest and they might check it out, maybe put something else they can interact with there. Then the player housing can grow inside and outside in your home instance.
---
So maybe don't flag the location? 
---
Maybe make it more like a guild bounty...say, the wanted mobs spawn in random locations on set times after last defeat, and follow random routes. If you accept the contract, you get an item in your inventory that self-deletes if the mark is killed. Alternately, if you kill the mark with this item in your inventory, it boosts your MF for that mob, as well as giving you a guaranteed drop of a "local contact tip" item, which you can use on future bounties to narrow down the location of the mark. 
---
So like, you grab one at Amnoon. The bounty agent there says they got a report of that mark to the southwest. If you go southwest, there might be another NPC out there somewhere that, if you find her and if you have the contract item, she says, "Herple Derp passed by here not long ago, heading west, toward the water works." Then you search the waterworks, find your bounty, and take them down. Now you get the loot drop plus a bonus bag that yields some loot, plus a local tip.
---
So you go back to Amnoon for a new contract and as soon as you activate it, you consume the local tip. It gives you a tip that says, "The Glorpmonster was just spotted dragging some prey back to its lair in the cave by the raptor ranch." 
---
This lets you skip the search and you're good to go.
---
AND AND AND Resize. Resizing is extremely important because of differential character size.
---
Weekly SR rant central?
---
Keep in mind the engi build has extremely low damage output and you’ll essentially be relying on your teammates to kill. 
---
It’s fine to start out with this, but as you get more comfortable I would suggest going for higher dps or support builds — this helps the boss dies faster, which in turns makes things easier since your group will have to deal with less mechanics.
---
TFW people actually call *dyeing an outfit* "matching"...
---
Totally agree. I played ESO for a bit, and for some fucking reason I cant explain, I spent over $50 on housing alone. It was so much fun to have a slice of Tamriel to call my own. My own little room in a tavern, or my own little house in Skyrim. I spent more time than I'd care to admit decorating it with bearskins, beds, desks, etc. 
---
I have no idea why its appealing, I guess it just adds that extra bit of depth to it. Add personal farming nodes, purchasable decorations, recipes for decorations, etc. to it and ANet probably just increased gem store revenue quite a bit. It seems like a small thing but having somewhere to go back to that is YOURS after fighting a dragon or God of war, that's special.
---
See, I like this.
---
And for good reason, the map's design and central mechanic are a travesty.

Exordium could be related to Glint's Lair in someways. If you look closely at the stowing animation, you can see some sort of shards, which reminds me a lot of Glint's Lair's environment, vanishing into the air.
---
It's not bannable and /u/deltaconnected has talked with Chris Cleary about it
---
If we were getting a good balance of content I wouldn't take as much issue with the open world.  
---
But it's going to be 11-15 months since the release of the last raid.  
---
7-10 months since the release of the last fractal.  
---
PvP and WvW have never received the support they need.  
---
For the past 2 years they've dedicated nearly all their resources into explorable style maps. PoF was an entire expansion that didn't have anything but these maps.  
---
And so I can't rely anything else but the open world to keep my interest, but it hasn't been able to do it in large part because of the lack of replayability, incentives, and long term goals.  
---
Every 3-4 months I log on, complete the story "complete" the map, and within a week I've already lost all interest in the game again.
---
One of us.
---
I am agreeing with you. :/
---
it cant be chaos weapons since i dont own any of them :)
---
That Excel-Sheet is nice - thank you.
---
Does anyone know of any other helpful Sheets like that, e.g. for Legendary WvW armor ? :D
---
Calling Condi Reaper *mean* is hyperbole, but, yeah. It really sucks. If you fully understand just how badly it sucks and bring it to troll, that's mean. But being ignorant of it isn't a sin IMO.
---
I wanted to comment here to highlight the [dT] website suggestion though. For Fractals specifically, it's superior to Snow Crows for the reasons butterlord suggested as well as the fact that it takes the fractal pots into account when determining appropriate gear.
---
Just be careful about min/maxing too much. If you want to bring something in raids and fractals, it's ok to overcap on say, boon duration or crit in fractals if it means you'll be capped for raids. If you can only have one set of gear, make it for raids and just be slightly suboptimal in fractals. Not having the appropriate BD or Crit chance in raids will be a lot more than slightly suboptimal.
---
I found this out AFTER I made Spero, but was glad to remember it for this one.  Now, watch them change it so that it won't work now that I'm all ready for it.  :D
---
[it's an achievement for the **Meteorlogicus III: Storm** collection](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Intrusion_Incarceration)
---
People don't expect a lot from T1 fractals, just a willingness to learn and listen to advice that's given to them (if it's a training run). As long as you voice that you're new, you shouldn't get any grief at all. 
---
If someone is giving you a hard time and you've voiced that you're new to fractals, chances are that the person getting angry would have gotten angry over something else anyway, and it's not really something you can control.
---
Take your time to learn the mechanics of the fractals, and once you're used to the routine, you can start focusing on your own performance. It'll become routine fairly quickly!
---
I meant the day I know it's may, it's wrote everywhere it's may, come one man....
---
Arcdps by a long shot.
---
Man the day, may is looking you know
---
That is the last time I played!
---
Yep again, I'm not dumb I can read it's may but you know may have 31 days so xD
---
Skills on weapons is still a stupid idea. What happened to the gw1 system where we could choose our own 8 skills?
---
Healer is not as braindead as ChmSteki is making it out to be.
---
In a really good party it's superfluous, so it does become easier there.
---
But for PUGs? Nah. Healing can be tough. To heal very effectively requires a lot of awareness and knowledge of what skills the party will be able to tank safely vs what skills you need to be saving big heals for.
---
Play Scrapper. They put out large amounts of healing and are very hard to kill.
---
Or Firebrand. Not as hard to kill as scrapper, but makes everyone around you harder to kill too.
---
I also hate when the adds stay outside of the ship and punish you with nukes from a position you can do nothing about, so if you got no pulls it will ruin your day.
---
&gt;Only difference is that Berserker's Core Warrior traits enable him to back out of fights due to the superior mobility from GS and Warrior's Sprint.
---
And discipline tree is exclusive to the core warrior right? xD
---
Just remember to not drop the solidified cleansing dispenser
---
Power Reaper is super survivable even in full Berserker gear.  There really isn't a compelling reason to run anything else, especially with the new Soul Eater.  Swing until you get low, then pop Reaper's Shroud and heal up; drop back out at full health and repeat.  You can play super aggressively and it will hard carry weaker groups.
---
Dragonhunter I would actually recommend against until you are comfortable with the content and playing with very good groups.  The main thing DH offers is a really powerful AoE burst that especially when coordinated with other players will phase bosses quickly.  I think it is an important character to have and learn if and when you start thinking about doing challenge motes, since it is by far the easiest character you can use to cleanly burst CM bosses in a well oiled group.
---
Outside of CM level performing groups DH is kind of trash though.  After its burst finishes its damage is sub-Reaper level, and it is way more fragile than many other options if you aren't getting good support.  It's largely a one trick character that has poor agency and will only be as good as your party allows you to be.
---
I would strongly recommend power reaper up to the point where you feel like you can hard carry poor groups.  Then start thinking about meta characters for more meta compositions where you don't need to carry and can just do your job.
---
I am not a fan of Siren's Reef but is it really too long? It is probably one of the shorter fractals already.
---
or in the case of Sugar Rush the devs' inability to understand their own game ...
---
My biggest issue with SR is that they use a different hue of orange for the knockback. I dont know why, but ANet has been using a very light shade of orange for some of their skills (or, as in Deepstone, orange death circle surrounded by orange nondeath circles), which makes identifying the dangerous area pretty hard for people with visual issues or just harder for most people since it is just that much more drowned out by visual noise.
---
Healer meta because of constant damage isn't challenge though, it is just fixing comps more. Many other fractals have huge damage like swanpland but they can be done without healers because its avoidable and telegraphed well. Well my point is that clearing sirens just isn't fun though.
---
It's thought to be caused by your ISP being too strict about terminating idle connections. At the end of an instance, you're standing still reading dialog, and that dialog is stored in your game files on your computer, so no data is being transfered. Your ISP sees that your connection to Anet isn't actually sending data, so it terminates the connection, and you get booted.
---
You can fix it easily by pressing buttons while cutscenes play. Even if those buttons do nothing, they still send data to Anet's servers, which keeps your ISP from terminating your connection.
---
I can get behind SR not being the most fun fractal (its still newish and people are stubborn) but I think it gets over blown because you cant just blitz past everything like urban battle ground and others.
---
The threat on the boss fight is the adds and getting knocked off. Reflects can cut down on the ranged pressure later in the fight. Stability is huge here as thats about all the boss does is AOE daze attacks. I think something people often miss is that the adds dont respawn as the fight goes on. "The adds just don't stop coming because the intervals are small" The adds spawn as the boss loses %hp like 5% per wave or something. So if your grps dps is shit the adds will come at a slower pace vs a grp that bombs the boss, important to note here you can actually dps the boss fast enough that the adds get backed up as only 3 can spawn at a time (each side) and since they have a spawn animation and need to move before the next wave spawns (mobs dont spawn inside of each others hitbox). At the beginning its ez because its not alot of adds to deal with until you get to the 50% mark then if the adds have not be cleared out the tiny amount of dmg they deal adds up. Plus the visual noise. Other than the adds if you dont get knocked off the ship the boss deals a tiny amount of dmg. This is all ofc with out mentioning boons and boon rip. Removing protection and quickness makes a difference.
---
and they've added some stuff to it since, such as this achievement
---
What is meant by "Final Legendary"? Are they not making any more after this?
---
Someone arrived at the party 10 years late... 2009 aka 2k9 was the last year this was able to be done and not look like a total idiot.
---
Besides Ad blocker is good for pop infested sites but for sites that help us is kind of being a douche bag.
---
Soon as you hit level 80 and have at least 10 gold to your name or more depending on what build you're pursuing, you're ready to start preparing. Find someone with a commander tag that'll help you practice on dps golems and optimize rotations. Rotation  is more important than the actual build so git gud at pushing buttons first so you're not doing less damage than your support despite running a dps build like a lot of pugs tend to do. You don't need to be perfect or amazing. You just need to do at the very least what is required to clear the fight without being carried. Don't min-max or glue yourself to the meta. But keep asking yourself how you can do more and trying new things. Be open minded. The only time your abilities should extend beyond doing damage is utility meant to make the specific fight easier assuming you're making use of said utility, support, tanking, kiting, and other fight specific roles.
---
I would recommend starting with a power build as they are the easiest to get and then go from there.
---
Yeah, SR is just annoying.
---
Messy mechanics spam makes for annoying fights.
---
Tons of trash mobs stretch the fractal and make the boss fights even more annoying.
---
The treasure running is reaaally uninteresting (and also littered with trash mobs).
---
I'd like to see the fractal either completely reworked and shortened or something like the CM fractals: time wasting stuff cut out, challenging encounters with clear mechanics.
---
guild halls are pretty much useless. sad but true 
---
the whole concept of this feature doesn't work
---
The real reason why ffxiv had playerhousing since the first year is the fact that the japanese devs work hard and are not lazy like arenanet employees.
---
I've never bought any of these because I can't be bothered to look up what's inside.
---
It's more than a L2P issue. I have a pretty consistent static group and we don't really get stuck on this fractal, but everyone still dreads it.
---
Even though it's fun the first time being like, "Hey look how my heal build dealt with all the condis" or "I brought a focus this time and notice how much easier it was since I kept pulling the adds" it really gets old fast.
---
There's still the fact that you rarely can use any of your skills that have a cast time over 1 second. And you know what? Despite the fact that Flux Bomb has always been one of the lowest risk instabilities, I always HAAATED it and I still do. It's just annoying, like the birds were. Siren's has the flux bomb mechanic built in.
---
Also the lack of CC. Fights just feel so wrong without the CC bar. The fight also takes place in a pretty confined space.
---
Like, I get it, some people may find the chaotic struggle more fun than others. However, isn't that what CMs are for? 
---
Then again, I wouldn't suggest making a CM in Siren's, because that means the daily maxers would have to do Siren's every day.
---
Considering it took them almost 4 years to get this set out (gen 2 was supposed to release with HoT), I don't think they'll be too eager to get on that ride again.
---
In my experience the groups that can't beat SR aren't very good at the other fractals either. But with how frustrating it is, I would appreciate reducing the adds rank and not spending green circles when the wind mechanic is active.
---
I hate the college of statics! Whose idea was it to make a bridge you have to JUMP across? Statics! And who decided not to put any guardrails in the city, hmm??
---
Statics sucks
---
Quality &gt; Quantity
---
Is that the color a WP turns when someone just discovers it?
---
How do they punish you from a position you can do nothing about? You can walk up to them, or you can plan ahead and bring pulls.
---
Doesn't feel that bad but is probably because I play necro. You can play power reaper or scourge and just cleave away and heal through everything.
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...
---
Buut due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). We have plenty of experienced heroes of different classes there that can guide you to the right direction.
---
Alternatively please check out this [class guide](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:What_Profession_Should_I_Play).
---
It is *exceptionally* weird.
---
The actual reference is to the original Robot Unicorn Attack on Adult Swim, which used that song, and involved rainbow robot unicorns. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Unicorn_Attack
---
But I like linking the actual music video because it's *so damned weird*
---
Adding to the other comment about the 80 boost;
---
You can also check out a class' elite before even leveling it if you go to Heart of The Mists as it unlocks everything while you're in there.
---
Who's the guy? Not trolling or anything. Just curiosity
---
Try a VPN, it solved the issue for me.
---
The one and only problem i really have with this fractal is mobs not disappearing when the "defend the ship with cannons" phase starts.
---
Sounds like a plan, should i use exactly what discretize power reaper says or alter it?
---
Any scrapper build you'd recommend?
---
Amazing!!!
---
The part shown in this clip is great. But the big bulky rings that they show in the other part of the trailer completely turned me off. They look like auto wheel hubs or something.
---
TBH I haven't really enjoyed any new Fractal after 99CM and 100CM.
---
*Note: quotes are paraphrased because asmongold is a prick, and I'm lazy.*
---
&gt;&lt;insert thing&gt; in WoW too!
---
Okay, and that means...? Sorry, but this is completely irrelevant. Also, the constant supercilious looks from him get... really old, really fast.
---
&gt;If you're a partner with a product, you're not gonna make a video and say negative thing about them
---
Bullshit. You're not going to blatantly lie and call their stuff stupid for no reason. You're also not going to fanboy and say "Lol everything is amazing!". Just look at the number of times Wooden Potatoes has said he doesn't like stuff about GW2. I'm sorry, but this is tinfoil-hat level stupid.
---
&gt;&lt;reacting to chat restrictions&gt; OH COME AHN
---
Oh boy. One of these douchewads that thinks restricting anything in a game is "LOL COMPANY BEING EVIL!!1!".
---
&gt;&lt;buying the expansions gives you new content&gt; So it's like WoW
---
No. It's like *LITERALLY ANY OTHER GAME WITH DLC EVER*. This is one step above me saying "Oh, you use a keyboard and mouse? So this is like Wow".
---
&gt;&lt;Why do people give a shit about new content and new maps?!&gt;
---
Because that's... literally new content? I'm sorry, but this was literally incomprehensible to me. What exactly else do you want?
---
That's where I'm gonna stop doing the quote-by-quote. He immediate reacts to the fact that the one of the expansions gives you mounts as if that's all it gives you (no new professions, no new content, no new story, no... anything) as if that's *SO HORRIBLE AND HOW DARE THE VIDEO FOCUS ON THAT*, and then immediately looks like a moron when the video says - not 5 seconds later - that the mounts are not just Generic MMO Mounts™. And now it's suddenly "badass". 
---
He then says that the big elephant in the room is that GW2 is basically dead and why aren't we talking about that. Nice straw-man.
---
He came into this video expecting to hate GW2 because it is not explicitly WoW. That's literally it. He's beyond obnoxious, and assumes that every game must follow the format of a 15-year old (albeit wildly popular) Blizzard game to the T. I gotta agree with others here; let's hope that someone like this *doesn't* join us. He's the antithesis of the GW2 ethos.
---
I'm sorry, but that's idiotic. That's like the people that say, "some troll in game is a really nice person in real life, and you should just get to know them!" or something. You're presenting your face (literally) as this persona.
---
Unfortunately, those Oiled Orichalcum Dagger Hilts aren't going to work for crafting a greatsword.
---
Fractal god should make it gold
---
Reef would be better if you could use stability to not get blown off the ship.
---
It is common for people on the same wifi to have the same external IP, however it is not a guarantee, so I should revise my statement to, ' If you and I log into gw2 from the same wifi, our accounts are possibly associated.'.  If your running a router (a true router, i.e. level 3 device) using ipv4, that router takes all traffic going out and gives it the appearance of the router's own external IP.  Currently google estimates that about 30% of all internet traffic in the US is ipv6 (https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html#tab=per-country-ipv6-adoption) and the remainder would be ipv4, so this is not some fringe case, ipv4 still makes up a large portion of the internet.  You may be able to test this yourself by simply googling, 'my ip' with both your smart phone and your computer.  If the numbers google gives you only have dots and not colons, your on ipv4.  If your on ipv4, you will see that all your devices have the same IP according to google.   The incoming packets are then routed based on port number to the correct internal ip by the router, but in my experience these port numbers are dynamic and changing frequently enough to be unreliable for identification.  In this situation, I don't think Anet would be able to tell which computer behind the router is accessing gw2, they all appear to be on the same IP, and the port number won't identify further.
---
haha this is gold :D
---
any pics of the characters in game
---
I got this going on Gentoo last night, but my video card is barely above a potato (nvidia 1030GT) so the framerates were a bit low, i.e. &lt; 5 fps.  :)  Admittedly it was using the graphics settings from my windows laptop which has everything just about maxed out.  
---
I guess I need to upgrade the video card to something decent to play this...
---
...and get the razer orbweaver working on there too.  
---
Really looking forward to playing GW2 on Linux.
---
How do u know that it Will be gift of metal if u may ask
---
Eh, at least she seems to enjoy the game and not do the "I'm soooo much smarter than you, guys!" crap.
---
&gt;I wanna play a game where I can invest all day into the game and I'll be better than someone that doesn't.
---
Holy shit please fuck off.
---
At least Lazypeon played the game and had the balls to give it another shot after his horrible first video. This tool has decided that you can only measure a community by youtube or twitch views. I suppose on one hand this video shows how far a part WoW and GW2 are. He thought you had to level a heart like the heart of Azeroth.
---
I've seen you people in WvW before lmao
---
Did they now? I always could complete fractals at T1 easily just between me and my girlfriend (we both with potions, food and good-but-not-perfect builds with ascendeds), at least the ones that the mechanics allow us (so, no underground facility). We did it with Twilight Oasis. We did it with Deepstone. But the two of us couldn't complete the last fight of SR, no matter how much we tried, just because the enemies overran us. Since then we've skipped days when SR is in the list. If it was hell at T1, T4 would not be fun even with more people.  
---
Point is...T1 is supposed to be where beginners start doing fractals, even if they have not the best equipment, or potions, or anything at all....Are they being able to complete SR?
---
Also doesn't help that it seems like they're all immune to hard CC even though they don't have a break bar.  My group has a Renegade whose usual plan of dealing with adds is dropping the pulsing Daze field from Kalla, and it does squat to those adds.
---
No thanks. Big waste of developer resources on something that will only be of practical use to an extreme minority. (i.e. RPers)
---
I get it, it's an alluring concept to some, but the reality is it's entirely one of those features people think they want, then end up using very little once implemented.
---
Considering the circumstances of GW2 &amp; ArenaNet, there are many other tasks/projects in GW2 that could make use of the dev time required and would be of greater benefit to the overall health of the game.
---
I’ve always hated Aurene as a character. We will meet in battle one day.
---
I always wonder if they actually changed the Gen2 Legendaries design wise while S3 was going on or if they had planned to release, say the shining blade, together with HoT. Maybe they didn't actually had them designed yet but I would love to hear a Dev. In general I would love to hear more about their workflow. Especially because I'm very keen to know how long the artists work on one Legendary.
---
Fun is subjective. It is for me.
---
There were similar posts when Pharus came out. IIRC the savings at the time was somewhere around 200-250g. I was in the middle of crafting Sharur when I remembered, still managed to save 50g.
---
Arigatooooooo Ed- samaaa ~^^~
---
Uhmm no it’s just that i calculated the gold I’d have to invest and it seemed a lot so I thought it’d be better starting farming gold at first :)
---
Okay thanks for the tip!
---
I see😊 I’ll give it a try then!
---
In GW2 the best way to show you are better than the others in PvE is by helping them do stuff. The better you are, the easier it is for you to carry other other players.
---
That concept can be a bit foreign for some people.
---
I think I have to focus on the part of keeping it slow😂 I tend to rush stuff like these.. thanks for the tip! 😊
---
The level 40 and 60 personal story, Tangled Paths (s2e6), and HoT act 3 all award uncapped keys every time you complete them. Other than that, the only option I know of is spamming map completion.
---
Oh okay! The gift of maguma will be a big challenge I think😂 but it’s gonna be funny definitely!😊 I’ll try not to rush it and to enjoy it!😊 thanks for the tip!
---
Soonest is the 20th.
---
Only fgs 5 has noticeable aftercast animation, but you drop it after casting the skill which will cancel the animation anyway.
---
The most important thing on weaver is coordinating skills with damage modifiers, meaning that you want to wait for fire attunement to be ready to cast your air 3 and 2nd fire attunement (weaver GM trait) for everything else.
---
Since you can cast skills while attuning it's usually good to precast skills when F1 or F3 are on ~0,5 sec cd and attune immediately, trying to sync the skill cast with attuning instead of waiting for attunement to become ready and then cast skills. This is especially useful for conjured weapons since they have big cast time. 
---
Ele is all about micromanaging skill casts, animations and dmg modifiers. Even if you know how rotation works, there's still a big dps loss if you don't pay attention to these.
---
I have the same problem -- always at the very end of an instance. Not every single time, but frequently enough that's it's incredibly frustrating. It happened during Super Adventure Box, too!
---
The worst was when I had to replay the entirety of The Departing literally six or seven times before I finally finished it... but it rarely happens that many times in a row. (I think that particular story instance just has issues in general.)
---
Hmmm... k, Value post, very elaborated.
---
Correction: fractals just don't feel fun
---
On one hand, I always thought Games Workshop is usually very possessive about their IP. On the other hand, have you searched for Warhammer on any mobile store lately?
---
Looking at other games plenty of people are interested in housing plus it could be a huge money earner for anet. Its almost a sign of incompetence that they have a setup for housing and have barely used it at all.
---
Tbh I'm laughing at the time it took you to do this meme.
---
Yes. Crafting is the primary way to get them. The Laurel vendor is a nice way to get a cheap boost to them but it's heavily time-gated so not practical as your only source unless you're very patient.
---
Shooshadoo: Introduced in a zone featuring arctic quaggans. (Possibly intended to be tied into it before it changed)
---
SS Divinity:  Introduced same patch revolving around Lake Doric and DIVINITY' REACH
---
Flames of War: Balthazar reveal introduced balthazar.
---
Claw of the Khan-Ur: Olmakahn are charr centric.
---
We're mainly talking about the boss fight, though it does irk me during the treasure/swamp phases when a cannon is left unmanned.
---
i've basically been living in the silver wastes to farm the gold in expectation for this
---
idk why some of those black lion exclusives  even give so much account value, i dont think you would even come close if you would convert them gem value to gold.
---
there are some other items aswell
---
What does the suspension message say?
---
Power Chrono - I'm experimenting with [the domination/GS version](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/) build.  If you were playing alone, without the benefits of a group, how would you modify this build to make it a little more geared toward survivability/solo(like soloing champions, etc)?

They still teased the legendary weapons, just in a different manner.

But why doe?

Asura Racial passive?

PUG groups with such person. Oof.
---
Honestly it is pretty much gemstore and Anet in the nutshell. New people who want to spend money would not ever do that because to orient in gemstore you need to play the game like for years. 
---
Whole mount licence fiesta is the joke if you did not played for the last 1.5 years. Bunch of QOL items appear in gemstore only when you on vacation or job trip (I am "buying" infinite magic tools since season 3). You can hunt one skin (profane armor in my case since 2012) and just miss it when you quit game for a month...
---
&gt;she did Research and that it was actually an official Retailer for Gw2
---
I would *really* like to see where she got this information from.
---
Commanders: Ranger is useless
---
Roamer: Ranger is op
---
What's Anet supposed to do?
---
What is good if you know which skin you want. 
---
There is no convenient way to check what skins are included in the new pack. Yes you could hover over each skin in the hero panel but that shouldn't be the way to do it.
---
I really wish in the mount panel you could either search or sort by set.
---
she *was* My best friend, I trusted her, And she was the reason that my account got Suspended. I dont know where she got this information, But I really should have done my own Research instead
---
&gt; Deception. Draw near.  
---
I'm assuming this is just a sign that says NOT A TRAP.  
---
&gt; Chain. Slice your target. Bite your concentration. Deal damage to your staff and a vine and aegis and strike nearby allies.  
---
Solid start. Not sure what happened in the middle. Ventari is crying about the last bit.  
---
&gt; Burst. Spin in the ability 1 now applied to grant yourself for a firm foot in the healing arrows. Strike that knocks down foes outside of maguuma jungle.  
---
I have no idea what the first part does, but if it knocks down *everything* outside Maguuma this is the best Warrior skill in the game.
---
I had terrible issues with dropping instances across the whole game after cutscenes or big battles that went into dialogue. It wasn’t my internet as everything was running smoothly, game fine out of instances and my friend also playing on the same internet had no issues doing the same content, so I had no idea what was going on. 
---
Right now my fix is to change the way the game downloads content from the options in game. I set it from idle to max/constant so it’s always downloading information for me and I haven’t disconnected since doing this. Maybe give that a try and see if it’s just the game going idle as it’s not needing to download new info?

SR sucks if you are a druid bcs everytime you fall to water your spirits are resetted.. Amazing pubishment for playing a certain profession.

If this analysis can be confirmed, Anet should fix it by sending keepalives.
---
That error mean that directx cannot be loaded. Possible causes:  
---
* Old drivers
---
* Old wine version
---
* Wineprefix is on an inconsistent state  
---
Possible solutions:
---
* Delete the game folder, delete the game from lutris and try to reinstall.
---
* If you are installing the game in a NTFS hard disk, try on an ext4 unit.

Tell support this story by creating a ticket, or create a new account. Is your falt. You just said it. You have to learn your lesson, no?
---
healers: Scourge healer to carry lazy pugs, heal rev if you care about meta and want do to CMs
---
non-healer supports: QuickBrand, Alacry Ren and boon chrono. QuickBrand and Ren are "Hybrid" they deal a decent amount of damage and offers utility buffs, tho you'd need a diviner's set and that pretty boring to farm. Those three a very much meta in any fractal encounter and some raids

Soulbeast is trash in group play and gets actively shunned by organized squads. It's apparently holy shit impossible in roaming?

I told them the story, And I certainly learned my lesson from it, I just wish they could've given us a specified time of unbanning instead of just saying "You were suspended lol take it up the butt"
---
I'm not saying anything about "You Owe me" At all, I'm just saying that, I did definitely learn my lesson out of all possible clauses, And that If I have to, I will legitimately buy Heart Of Thorns, And the Gem Cards, Legitimately, out of my OWN pocket.
---
No you'll have to make the changes manually yourself. But it shouldn't be much of a change But if  you want you can make a new copy and just fill it in afterward but it might easier to just fix it yourself
---
TO doesn't have an issue with trash mobs because you can just skip the lot with stealth and portals. Deepstone is a bit hard gated but I don't mind, I think the annoying boss fight is the main issue.
---
You're not suggesting viper at that point and instead what? Rabid? Carrion? Sure that named armor is going to be cheaper but again way worse than good condi gear like viper. If you are suggesting viper gear then crafting it would be many times more expensive than berserker. I don't consider 3 characters geared in exotics to be all that old (vs say 10+ geared in ascended) but I did mean that comment in general. Reaper is also great for solo play due to high vulnerability, might, quickness, and crit chance without needing support. Again though, anything can be viable in open world and I would like to see your suggested build. I'd just say that cheap and easy to get berserker gear is going to beat out any other core stat for damage and kill speed, and in open world killing easy mobs quickly means they don't even have a chance to hurt you.
---
I would consider DH already a support with the blocks you give and the utilitys you can pick for example WoR.
---
Renegade would be a save choice tho. I don't believe support necro is useful at all in Fractals
---
Can you get purple mask after 29th? My partner just signed up now, will he get it in next few days?
---
He had some problems though, he would sign up, reload page and it was back at zero. Now its stable, but we dont know if he will get it. Should he write support?
---
That’s the tldr right here. Do your own research for everything. Maybe this can serve as a lesson for that.
---
I think it's on purpose that they're tied to HoT, so nope
---
I love it.
---
this is when you need to admit someone has addiction issues
---
/s
---
I'd say there is a 0% chance of that ever happening. The G2 Legendaires were supposed to be HoT features, so I don't see them going back to revisit them now that we are a year and half out from the expansion AFTER HoT.
---
That's fair! I can't say I've ever actually tried myself, and though I didn't say it in my post I never meant for those numbers to be true. It was, as you said, my perception of typically unskilled players are the only ones running the crutch gear. It makes sense that they would be doing extra low DPS, not due to gear, but due to lack of skill. I'll edit my original post to reflect this.
---
Regardless, I do stand by a 40% DPS loss in order to tank hits to be completely pointless, and overall the game will be easier for someone if they learn with the full glass cannon. You shouldn't be getting hit by any moves big enough to one shot a glass cannon regardless.
---
[Why didn't you just do a 2 second google search?](https://www.google.com/search?q=arena+net+official+retailers&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_deDE760DE760&amp;oq=ARENA+NET+OFFICIAL+RE&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0.5739j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) The first result is what you need.
---
For WvW support Firebrand, you'll wanna go full Minstrel's.
---
For PvE like Fractals and Open World, most content heavily favors power damage. You'll wanna go full Berserker's for most PvE content, especially Fractals where condition damage is severely outclassed by power damage. 
---
There is virtually no reason to run condition damage outside of specific raid encounters. For this reason, I only suggest investing in Viper's gear if you have ample resources to spend on your Firebrand, provided you gear Berserkers first. If you're only gearing condition damage for raid, consider just gearing a different class like Mesmer as condition Firebrand is only situationally useful on some encounters, but mostly outshined by other condition specs.
---
You may also consider running full Harrier to off-heal in raids, but you're more likely to find better investment in a Berserker's set it your resources are limited and you have to make choices between.
---
If you're able and you prefer to play your guardian over other classes, consider investing in legendary armor so you can swap stats at will. This will make the process a lot more convenient for you.

[Shining blade](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-81957) will need 290 [tribute to the queen](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tribute_to_the_Queen) total turned into 290 [shard of the crown](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shard_of_the_Crown). Counted in the total are the 30 needed for exemplar's edge, 60 for vengeance, and 100 for Save the queen. [Chest of legendary shards](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chest_of_Legendary_Shards) can be purchased once a day for 10 laurels and gives 3 shards of your choice. It is worth noting that 2 handed shards cost more to make ([1063g for 290 2 handed vs 840g for main hand vs 618g for off hand](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~290-81961;290-89947;290-79784)). You can also convert 400 offhand shards to 300 of any type you can see the [rates of all here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Enormous_Chest_of_Legendary_Shards#Notes). All that said, getting main hand shards with laurels isn't all that bad but it does eat through them for pretty low numbers back and is time gated (both with laurels and purchases) so you'll need to still craft a bunch (would take 97 days with 970 laurels) your 200 over 20 days will only get you 60 shards.

I'm not just going to "Make a new account" And piss on that one. If this one is permabanned with no help of getting it back whatsoever, I'm probably never gonna play the game ever again
---
Thank you for the quick reply.  
---
I tried to reinstall and ended up getting the same error.  
---
I deleted the game from lutris, the game's folder was fully deleted.  
---
I re-installed via lutris and got the same error   
---
My system version of wine is `wine-4.7 (Staging)` the wine version lutris is using is `tkg-4.0-x86_64` which was selected by default when installing via lutris.
---
I also tried downloading what looked like the newest version for wine inside lutris' wine version manager which gave me `tkg-4.6-x86_64` this as well did not work with the same error.
---
I am installing on an ext4 drive, though it is mounted from a LUKS encrypted drive in case that is causing an issue.
---
There's a reason for that. The [Elite Quartermaster](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Elite_Quartermaster) enemies have an *autoattack chain* that applies stability to allies adjacent to them (their other attacks also apply Aegis). Several of the other enemies that constantly spawn also have their own CC skills just to make things even more of a hassle.

If you walk off the ship during the boss fight you're standing in the poison/confusion mists and will die very quickly, so no, you can't "walk up to them".

[Cookie](https://www.twitch.tv/thecookiedoh) streams some but only has a couple [videos on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWo87AUDp1WnkCeHnIq_oKw) and it doesn't look like he has played in a while. [Naru](https://www.twitch.tv/notoriousnaru) also streams and you can see livestream archives there. I really like WP's [game of the day videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOuEuQiXhSXllCvOU-TtRJLaBuLI7m1V8), he has [a couple on firebrand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0wcSGzYCc&amp;list=PLOuEuQiXhSXllCvOU-TtRJLaBuLI7m1V8&amp;index=37&amp;t=0s) but I'd say he is mainly an elementalist and mirage player. Even if he isn't as experienced with the specific build (at least earlier in the series) he is a good PvP player and gives great moment to moment commentary.
---
In various trailer the commander wears something odd, so could be any from the 3 classes
---
&gt; personally i dislike the direction anet went with difficulty being dancing around aoe indicators instead of watching boss animations
---
100% agreed with that lol
---
I mean deepstone itself is trash, sure absolutely, but you're right the map is not populated with many trash mobs.
---
How far off the ship can mobs hit you? I've never seen them further than the gangplank while Crowe's alive.
---
Usually they're hanging around at the bottom of the sloped gangplanks, not *that* far off. But it's enough.
---
maybe i didn't phrase it properly as "slow", should've been more like "looks like mostly scepter auto from range"? dunno
---
perhaps i'll give it a try some day, after i re-learn some easier solos like lupi to warm up
---
if you were going to buy gems on a website, why not just use the gem store in-game and pay with your card or a paysafecard?

This should have no place in real world and OP would have super high chances to fight himself a way in court in europe and win it.

There are some abilities that just don't have LoS as a requirement. It doesn't always have to be, you just gotta remember they exist.
---
Trash in pugs is hyperbole, but it is a stretch to call it a carry.  Chronos hard carry pugs.  A good healer will hard carry a lot of pugs.  PS Warrior makes bad groups feel good, Reapers solo everything, staff Eles are super safe with all kinds of non-CM goodies and even Daredevil can put on IP and facetank a lot of stuff.
---
DH is fine, but it is just a guy and doesn't do anything special in a bad group.  When there are lots of characters that are exceptional around bad players DH just doesn't compete.
---
I should have been more clear on the Reaper thing.  DH has a higher DPS overall than Reaper, but it is dominated by that burst - after those 12s or so of burst it is basically a dogshit DPS until that burst comes back up.  It sawtooths in performance hard, and averaging the two together gives you slightly higher performance than a Reaper.

---
This with Sinister Trinkets/Weapons because you get a Full Ascended Set from LWS2 and something cheap for the Armor.
---
Again. This is purely for Open World Content. I wouldn't run this in Fractals or anything but this safely kills HoT Champs, Djinn Champs, some Legs etc. where any Melee Berserker Build even Shroud Reaper will eat Damage like crazy.
---
Sure if you're playing on full concentration, dodge all the hard hits and dish out a decent damage rota like you would do in group content you can get things done with Reaper but I don't think that's what most people do in Open World.
---
The UI for that would be really confusing, as would all the extra work the devs have to do each time they add a mount. Would be nice though.
---
In the full Turret Build, it seems I did use Thumper over Rocket. For the General Eng Build (Toolbelt/Kit mainly) I have Rocket listed but I might have wanted to use Thumper instead; I made a note to try it next time I use Eng.
---
wait..from where are you getting these numbers? i get fractals being upwards of 20(more like 15 but sure)..but how is tarir and chak 9g? the gemstone is like 1.6g nowadays and the 2-3 unid rares(and other trash loot) don't push them that high
