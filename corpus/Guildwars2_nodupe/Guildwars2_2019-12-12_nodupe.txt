&gt;It just woke up in one specific part of the Unending Ocean and has remained within the ocean.

---
This is a pet theory of mine -- what if the DSD invaded the tengu lands? We'd have no way to know, and it's a giant island -- perfect for an ocean dragon to target. 
---
Plus, tengu are cool.

Which client people usually install? 32 bits or 64? I went for the 64 bits client assuming that's he norm.

Most likely in March. Most all sales are predictable by looking at the wiki.  Last two year running it has been in March.  I would bet on that month but it could come sooner.
---
You didnt provide any region or what game you interested in btw so add that and hope for the best. Gl
---
You dont need stacks to open chests.
---
Im normally about also going through a shitty time atm using gw2 as an escape atm,  if you wanna add me on discord or anything lemmi know
---
Anecdotal defenses.
---
That's all.
---
Honestly when it comes to elite specs I'd rather see
---
Paragon - Guard spec using spears, wells and the virtues upgraded to be like tempest overloads in that only one can be active at a time but they are stronger and can be overloaded.
---
Drill Sargent - Warrior using double pistols &amp; mantras.
---
Brood Lord - Necro spec using 2 one handed swords, lots of life steal and group offensive buffs with mobility but shroud has almost no defence and acts akin to scourge shroud. Uses deceptions.
---
Bard - Memser that uses off hand focus (make enemies dance while they slowly die)
---
Arcanist - Arcane archer elementalist using longbow. (meditations maybe)
---
Dragonfist - A thief that gives up stealth for aoe heals, aoe barrier and other ways to mitigate damage for themselves/their team. (Double focus as fist weapons)
---
I would love to add you but i dont have the time to play, i hope you find someone. If you want to you can Massage me your Username. But im Still Kind of a noob, hope you dont mind.
---
Opinions are like ass holes, everyone has one.
---
Neat, though I'd rather see Balthazar be the elite spec with greatsword and a fire theme.
---
Then again, that could be the best way to combat ice.
---
&gt; Opinions are like ass holes, everyone has one. 
---
Okay but isn't this contradictory to what you just posted? You're basically telling people to stop saying bad things, criticisms or not.
---
 Nope, just my opinion. Game is great.
---
I changed a couple of graphic options just in case which are well known to cause issues like post-processing from ultra to low, since SMAA would take care of anti-aliasing post-processing sometimes would just make things blur.
---
I mean, it could be anything; all I know is that I ran RDR2 at 100+ FPS no problem which is much more demanding and supposedly more fragile due to "just launched" status, as you know it caused many issues for many people during the 1st 2 weeks of launch.
---
Most people tank SH in minstrels, especially beginners. So now that's 3 builds. 
---
You're maybe missing the point if being able to hard carry the boons if paired with a mediocre bug chrono in pugs. You can almost solo quickness a 10 man squad and give an extra 50% alacrity to the 2nd subgroup. Overcap so hard, boons are never a problem, no matter who the 2nd chrono is.
---
Hi! We have a super friendly guild you can come join. Feel free to add me at Mikksmix.8219 if you're on the North American server and we'll shoot you an invite.
---
People are sharing their experiences with the game. Whether or not It's a good or a bad one - not up to you to decide. Just because you think "It's an amazing game" doesn't make it for THEM.
---
&gt; Just said game was great 
---
No you didn't. 
---
&gt;People need to stop giving this game such a bad rep
---
This is basically you telling people to like it or shut up.
---
&gt; You’re trying to pull this whole scholarly thing and twist this argument into your favor to make yourself perceive some false fallacy 
---
Right back at you.

Ok, so if I call you a dirty n word and I get banned here does it mean there is no freedom of speech here?
---
Also, let me just add that to an extent, this feeling of being in empty zones may not go away even at level 80. I play a lot during the week or late in the evening, and I'm often completing maps or unlocking mounts several months behind everyone else because I take my time and switch up things whenever I'm bored. (Weekends are obviously the best time to get some stuff done because tons of people are on.) I highly recommend trying everything in this game, because the more stuff you enjoy, the less you will feel stuck doing one thing over and over until it's boring and you're burnt out. I'm still unlocking the Skyscale mount, but the other day I stopped to spend some time trying to get onto the airship that circles Dragon's Fall and whoa, that was cool, riding around the map from that high up, and then I spotted something else cool looking to check out, which led me to an event, etc.
---
The level of detail in a lot of the maps is really cool - don't skip that first "Whooooa!" experience of being a level 5. It's awesome, and it's why a lot of vets still make new characters to level sometimes.

---
&gt; All unlimited-use mining tools will now strike four times instead of three when mining rich ore nodes.
---
The normal vendor tools also do it but that was done in an earlier patch. 
---
Unfortunately due to ANet's consistent inconsistency at least one of the tool released after that patch still only gathers 3 so that is why it is only "most" and not "all"
---
In game rewards?  Don’t bet on it.
---
I was thinking the same.  The moment gold farming actually approaches slave wages, you'll see the game ruined by 3rd world slave farmers.  The TP will crash.

Assnet makes it look bad enough. We don’t have to do much.

ever played guild wars 1? or warcraft classic is what im spending a lot of time on atm. but anyway, would still be down to play some gw2. dm me your discord if you want
---
Talking about library and the next thing is a paragraph taken from wikiipedia. Ja moin.
---
In different templates, I imagine it should be okay.  The items wouldn't be equipped at the same time.  Not in the same one, though.
---
I fail to see a correlation between your statement and argument.
---
As a new player, don't worry about spending your hero points.  You get more than enough to buy every skill and trait in the game.  As such, spend them on what looks appealing to you, and if you don't like the results, you'll get to change them up in a level or two.
---
Amen - Best update ever other then this annoying problem.
---
A mini penguin might help, if only there was one in the game.
---
What matters is whether or not the off-template is considered equipped. If it is, then you wouldn't be able to use both, but if it isn't, and the other response suggests its not, then you could. Since between two templates there are FOUR earring slots, this can matter if the attributes are going to be different between the two.
---
Hope you're right!
---
I felt really clever when I made an Asuran revenant called "Channeler Bingg". No one has ever commented though. Maybe if I were in a guild called "Freinds"?
---
Desert Shroud vs Harbinger Shroud for PvE? Seems like DS has higher power while HS has higher torment? Which has one has higher condition damage?
---
Interesting, I feel the exact opposite to this. Whenever one of the holiday events rolls along, I just can’t wait for it to be over. They sort of ruin things as they suck people out of every other part of the game.
---
The thing is they have dynamic gold &lt;-&gt; gem conversions, so it's the players setting that price.
---
Yeah the game will see those as two different items and load them accordingly
---
Dynamic conversion between gems and gold pretty much stops that happening. If gold becomes so valuable that gems are not worth buying with real world money, then the gems -&gt; gold conversion will dry up, everyone will just do gold -&gt; gems and drive the price back to around where it is now.
---
All this elite spec talk gets me depressed. They know we want thrm really bad but just refuse to come out and say “Theyre being worked on, no eta!” or “We dont care about this right now”
---
If you can't find a code or don't want to wait for a sale buy it from https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43807 which is an official seller

I main a Condi Holosmith. Good amount of conditions, with some good bursting power and CC, if need be. The only real problem is getting used to kits.
---
Anything not retarded to say?
---
Okay thanks so much! Is there anyway to move around faster other thn being on foot?
---
Thanks for the video.
---
Couldn't find the build links, did you get a chance to post them? 
---
There is quite a dearth of simple or instructional guides on different professions I used to have different characters i could use, now I use less, guides help understand new mechanics.
---
But it's difficult to find guides when they all are criticized, because apparently everyone can make a better guide, but not many actually do. Suspicious of boasters who can nitpick, but not criticize constructively or put effort towards a ample guide. Thanks again for the video.
---
In playing thief!
---
Then it's pretty easy.  In the Signets skill tree, look for Signet of Shadows, buy it and equip it as a utility skill.  As long as you **don't** activate the skill, you'll get a 25% boost to your movement speed.
---
meh, zerg mode is pvp with more steps and less pvp.
---
nice production quality, it strikes my fancy when i find well produced guides or any type of gw2 content :)
---
I mean, you're not *wrong,* but you're not *right* either. Same chaotic dumbass energy, but Sett is more of a jerk.
---
Those numbers though..
---
Criticism is the apex of fandom.
---
Shh, don't give them that idea ;p I was thinking of just asking for only a transparent option, but figured it could be something to expand on, that could give at least some value to the stacks of guild commendations sitting around unused.
---
They should have roughly the same damage by themselves, however with Desert Shroud you get more proc of Dhuumfire, Demonic Lore and even Barbed Precision than with the Harbinger Shroud (1 hit vs 6 hits). On top of thatit means you do not pick Sadistic Searing which could also up a bit your damage and give you a lower CD on Punishments (so at least the heal). In a situation with adds I would say that Desert Shroud makes it more likely for you to hit some of the moving adds with some hits of the Desert Shroud while it would be very hit-or-miss with the Harbinger Shroud.
---
So Desert Shroud it is.
---
I also did some quick testing on a training golem and Desert Shroud had very slightly more power damage (5.2k vs 4.8k) and also slightly higher Torment damage (45k vs 40k).
---
being able to farm for something that isn't just a cosmetic you'll use for 2 days. Really fun seeing the power difference.
---
Its almost like ArenaNet should be releasing rewards that give you a feeling of progression 🤔
---
Hmmmm
---
Not ice themed, but I really Really want dual pistols on Necromancer, and hey, Warrior got dual dagger, so there is precedent.
---
Necromancer, **Dreadshot**: Dual Pistols
---
The dreadshot has taken it's knowledge of combining flesh and bone, and mixed it with the darkest alchemy to create a fusion of magic and science. What better way to ensure the death of their enemies than to riddle their body with holes from a safe distance?
---
The basic premise is to be power based damage, but still deal out a bunch of non damaging conditions to be thematic and interesting. The durations would have to be pretty short, but it would be a harassment dps spec in PvP/WvW, and Damage with mild support in PvE.
---
1) Bone Round/Blood Round/Sinew Round - Vulnerability/Weaken/Cripple your foe (respectively) and deal damage.
---
2) Rime Round: Chill your foe and deal damage. 
---
3) Kneecap: Immobilize your foe and deal damage.
---
4) Spirit Shot: Slow your for and deal damage.
---
5) Homunculus Shot: Fire a miniature Flesh Golem which bounces between targets, knocking down the first two hit and launching the third. 
---
F1 ability - Gunslingers Shroud: Crouch low and steady your aim, wrapping yourself in shadow while devastating your target with constant fire. Gain Protection, Resistance, Stability, and Immobilized. Your attacks cycle through your four Round abilities every .5 seconds for 8 seconds.
---
The idea is to be able to deal a substantial amount of damage in a short time, while being immune to CC, and resistant to damage, but you can be easily outranged or line of sighted by enemies who are expecting it.

You can also simply hide the whole chat box, people rarely say anything interesting or useful mid match anyway

I see.
---
I stopped playing shortly after dinging 80 (?) a few weeks after WotLK was released so. Early 2009.
---
I most likely have...
---
Thanks, I'll definitely look into those.
---
IIRC the crash logs are stored in *AppData\Roaming\Guild Wars 2*, it might help you find the issue.
---
Wikibot got my back, good bot.
---
Some people are more goal oriented than others I guess. 
---
It's meant to be rewarding for dedicated play, and there's a sense of accomplishment when that final boss finally dies. Then there's the breath holding and tongue biting for those one or two bosses that seemed so out of reach and you see their health tick down in those final few percentage points. And that sigh of relief and joy that follows afterward is why I feel Perfected Envoy armor should be raid exclusive. It was designed from the ground up to be a Raid exclusive reward. Why is that vexing for some people? 
---
Yes legendary weapons are much easier to get but they also take some dedication especially since they're designed to get you to try out every aspect of the game (gen 1= core tyria plus wvw) and Gen 2.0 = HoT and WvW)
---
They take work too and it can be frustrating to do some of the collections. 
---
But trust me the Perfected Envoy Collection is no where near as bad as other Legendary Weapon collection. 
---
If you are an advocate for fairness and equality then why do you not see that WvW and PvP legendary armor is fair and balanced compromise for PvE armor?
---
PvE armor is the easiest to get out of the 3, followed by PvP and finally WvW. And think about it ANYONE can get those pieces of armor by simply playing long enough its way less effort to get.
---
Okay but you literally just missed my point.
---
The current PvE armor *cannot be ontained* by some people who want the pve armor. No matter how good or dedicated of a player they are, they have lives, they have dispositions, something prevents them from dedicating the time to obtain that armor.
---
I literally said "sure they can do wvw or pvp" but followed that up with thst some people have dispositions even towards that.
---
Thank you! I actually want to go Firebrand once I get there.
---
I am biased, but Guardian is almost always welcome anywhere. Power dh, condi fb, healfb, quickness, stab, aegis on demand
---
If jormag really wanted us to go to sleep it would have started it with "Your mad king says…"
---
No worries I've been reading both these forums and the GW2 ones. Guardian is the least complained about one as far as I can see. Power, precision and ferocity I believe is considered the best option for all classes while leveling. :) I have zero plans on dropping the Guardian because of one person's beef with this class. I like to learn myself. ;)
---
I do like the sword/torch mix. Good to know how the GS works with hitboxes. Thank you!
---
Just remember April fools day. Invasion of the mini gwen
---
There's still likely a few people assigned to it, but imagine the mountains worth of reports they have come in on a daily basis, and then think of how long they have per week to specifically focus on those reports?
---
It'll get addressed, but it may take weeks or months for the results to occur.
---
Power herald is meta in WvW rn.
---
If u want to go for pve, than the only good option is renegade, full diviner's is best.
---
For pvp there are currently power herald and condi renegade .
---
If u want more info about the builds, just go to metabattle.com , there are most usable builds
---
I get about 1.5hr per night to play. Maybe even less. Im not about to spend that time doing mindless farming. I much prefer to use some of my wage money to buy gem and convert into gold. So i can actually enjoy the game. Last time i farmed silverwaste, i almost feel asleep in the first 15 mins. After that i quitted the game for 3 months lol.
---
Make peace with your god little Asura, because there is no way my group of 50 is going to break that CC bar.
---
What's RMT?
---
Wow he's "daddy issues" - the character
---
Thank you for sharing this.   
---
In your "UnidGear" page some items have negative values and the "Profit per Gear" seems to highlight another value.
---
Hey, I got like 4g/h last night, woooo...
---
You should have used 55hp monk....
---
feels oooooof XD
---
I dont get it why this guy is getting downvoted? In my country minimum wage job would get you 69gold/hour. And thats good by eastern europe standards lmao.
---
So "Profit per Gear" is the profit you make by buying gear and salvaging it instead of the value of the drops itself (1.63s)?
---
I am downloading the game back again if ya got discord add me Samko#5568
---
If you care about fractals and raid training gone wrong with nice people you can message me.
---
Yeah. Was news to me too. Kinda sad.
---
Depending on the Group comp basicly every class is good for fractal/raids. I would recommend to make the decision which class you want to play  dependent not on what meta is, but just to try some classes and play which you want to play.
---
Glad to be of help :)
---
Yeah, obviously. A perfect performance on everything on a full Wing clear would be insane to grind. But you still want to be within a certain threshhold of a very good killtime and If you don‘t meet that you simply go again. That was my point. ^^
---
I think you misunderstand them. They don’t mean if you’re simply putting your paycheck into the game you’d do better than a person constantly farming.
---
What they’re saying is the farming mechanisms have gotten worse as ANet has minimized them to try to make more money rather than allowing reasonable farming.
---
You'd still wonder how on Earth they were able to actually ship the game with so many armor sets in 2012. Because well, if one set takes 9 months, do the maths....
---
In other words, as long as they don't prove my otherwise, this sounds like a lame excuse to me.
---
Thanks
---
Thanks!
---
I don't know maybe have more people focused on armor creation, because it would be bad for an MMO to start with only 5 Sets? 
---
They had 6 years. In the base game there are around 36 non racial sets this would be 27 years of development but only if they only had 1 developer working on armors, which is not the case. Lets say they had 5 developers working on them which would mean they only need 5.4 years to create the 36 sets and even that is a low number of developers. 
---
Now Armor sets are not that important anymore and now they use the developers for more important things.
---
If I missed replying to anyone, my apologies. I haven't completely figured out how Reddit works as of yet! But I have read everything and really appreciate all the help and encouragement!
---
Well then it sounds like you're outta luck, since Kralkatorrik ate the underworld.
---
Besides Tac0 (if you want to use it) look at a Orphan guide online for a list of buffs to increase your Karma gains. Some of the buffs might be easy even for a new player to get.
---
&gt; I also had 120 levels in boosts and a number of lvl 40 boosts - now I have 7 x lvl 80 chars
---
and yet you were struggling with the same question a few days ago?
---
your story doesn't add up.
---
Level manually, it's an important step to learning the game.
---
if you buy the expansion just save your boost for your next character.
---
I know your point is that the mode is kinda lackluster on rewards, but an hour of WvW is so much more fun than an hour of mindless farming that this comparison doesn’t make much sense to me. I mean I’m having trouble going through a single iteration of SW meta, let along the CF after it when time usually flies in wvw
---
Noice.
---
Fair point. I think most people don't get that we have a lots of fun time on voice while we are farming. Dragonfall and Metatrain are completely diverse and have no repetitive behaviour in comparison to SW RIBA.
---
How to handle the nighmare keys in silverwastes? I found the hidden area through a skrit tunnel but the dogs there one shot me. I got 3 keys that I got from doing the silverwastes rotation.

In addition to what's already been said, a slow, but consistent and passive source of obsidian is also the mining node in the desert guild hall.

Join a guild based in windswept haven and you should be able to pick up 1-3 per day there too.

RMTs do not operate within a game's economy, that's why they're almost universally against the ToS in games. Also, we're not talking about minimum wage in hyper-fucked banana republic fun-bucks, we're talking about the American dollar.
---
&gt; Ok, but you're wrong, so. . .
---
So what makes you 100% right? Because it sounds to me like all of you guys are just stating an opinion, like I am. None of you can factually prove that GW 2 survived as long as it did thanks to horizontal progression. You can't argue that **Masteries** are really the reason people are still playing GW 2. Or that fashion is the anchor that keeps people playing.
---
Most people that don't play those other games and prefer GW 2 prefer it for one of two reasons, or both, long term vets of the franchise such as me or Woodenpotatoes, or people who don't want to pay for a sub fee and the competition is either ESO which isn't everyones cup of tea or F2P Korean P2W MMOs. 
---
The latter end up either enjoying it or leaving while the former either loves it or never really gave it a shot because of rose-tinted glasses. 
---
This game has solid gameplay. It has great lore. Pretty good story telling (much better than launch but I personally enjoyed that era). But it doesn't have good progression. After the first 80 levels, that's it. You got your gear. You went for ascended because you do Fractals or are anal about DPS numbers. Or legendary because you're a masochist (guilty as charged). 
---
What's next? OK, you have sub classes. That's cool. OK, there's only two. What's next? Masteries? So, this "amazing" horizontal progression that keeps people playing are mechanics that should be baked into the game that are actually locked behind a currency and exp? Like auto-loot. 
---
You only do it once, which isn't in of itself a bad thing but jesus, sometimes I just want to play an alt and actually work my way back up rather than just have it all which makes 2-80 completely arbitrary. 
---
My ability to mount or glide shouldn't be progression. It should be a part of exploration. Yes, you can block it off with a level to keep a sense of growth, but all of that should be tied to precisely that, your growth. But no one plays and stays because "oh, I can glide forever now", especially because you only did it once. It was cool, it was great, but it's not what keeps anyone here.
---
I love this game. But nothing about the horizontal progression is a good argument to stick around for. After a while, all you do is just add more and more to nothing. You don't grow anymore. Not in this iteration of the mastery system. What's next? Double jump? Fishing? A mastery for 5 new emotes that let you physically interact with other player avatars? Maybe another one-shot ability that you only use in a single map. Remember spider-mander or remember that one time we used Raven to weaken a Risen? Oh, wait... 
---
That's not progression. That's novelty. And novelty wears off.
---
I think you're completely misunderstanding my point.
---
I never once spoke about stat progression. Or gear grind. I don't dislike GW 2 because I want gear and stat grinds. I'm not looking for that. Nor do I hate that type of progression. I enjoy it just as much as any other WoW veteran. But that's not my point.
---
You don't need vertical stat growth to make a compelling game. It just so happens that horizontal progression in this game is weak and offers nothing to you that is meaningful.
---
And then you go on talk about collecting skins. That's not progression. Not unless you're progression a collection... but that's not horizontal progression. Not even close! That's just busy work.
---
Progression is growth, whether horizontal or vertical. It needs to be something for you to grow as a character. Not for you to look good.
---
Hello everyone, I haven't played probably since PoF came out and im curious what the state of the game is? I've been bouncing from MMO to MMO to realize that what im missing is GW2 and would like to come back but I've heard about some layoff drama and people are concerned for the future of the game? Any insight would be appreciated.
---
It cannot be unseen
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; You don't need vertical stat growth to make a compelling game. It just so happens that horizontal progression in this game is weak and offers nothing to you that is meaningful.
---
I don't understand what you do want then. 
---
&gt;And then you go on talk about collecting skins. That's not progression. Not unless you're progression a collection... 
---
Nailed it in one. Progression is *anything* you move towards. That can be toward higher stats, it can be toward new abilities, it can be to skins you don't have. Anything that you lack and put forth an effort to acquire, that is progression. *Your* problem is that you haven't found something that it interests *you* to progress *towards,* but there are plenty of things in the game to chase. 
---
&gt;but that's not horizontal progression. Not even close! That's just busy work.
---
All progression is busy work. All "horizontal progression" means is that it is progress at which every option is equally strong, where you don't need to stack C on top of B on top of A, but can just choose A, B, or C freely. Horizontal progression is being able to spend your time filling out masteries, *or* clearing achievements, *or* collecting skins, or whatever *you* want to do, in whatever order *you* want to do them in. 
---
&gt;Progression is growth, whether horizontal or vertical. It needs to be something for you to grow as a character. Not for you to look good.
---
For you, that may be true. For others, it is not. Those other people are happy with this game, people who are not, have other games with more linear progression models.
---
2 days late, but GW2 IS very CPU intensive. Saturating a 4690 is pretty standard. I don't think you have any problems apart from the game being the game.
---
The Witcher 3 - Leshen?
---
You are right, they aren't.  However, when one ice golem looks identical to another then you have a problem.  White knight Anet all you want, it's quite clear they ripped off the design from ESO
---
Whats wrong with playing for a month and loaded arcdps and Taco? I used to play Wow and using addons is a common thing
---
WE MUST SATISFY THE GRUDGE!
---
Most people do. they just don't check resource usage because they don't happen to notice 30 fps in lion's arch and WvW. It's an objective, measurable fact that GW2 uses as shitton of CPU and uses it for nothing but still running like trash. 
---
Everyone has this "problem" most people just don't experience it as a problem for them.
---
Oh, totally. But after month? Eeehhhh. Idk. Maybe that's just me.
---
I was afked at the place where people usually do while waiting for Tequatl to spawn and got teleported to a cave to bottom right of Sparkfly Fen I think, there were spider mobs and stuff.
---
I'm not so sure about that. It's not like the basic design of the creature is unique to either of those games, and a lot of the details between them are fairly different.
---
Inspired by? Maybe. Ripped off? Probably not.
---
That's you, a lot of people install a game and watch for all addons they can install before even playing.
---
C'mon r/Dornsinger, give us the full story of this "I got accidentally teleportet" incident
---
what's wrong with after month? I really don't get what your point is
---
Ok then.
---
okay, I will put it in the main thread
---
It's not about that. There can be hundreds of different ice golems of all possible shapes and sizes. But we have this instead. A copy.
---
Leshen or even Wendigo in most popculture - the look originally comes from the Leshen, but for some reason a lot of popculture applies it to wendigo as well, and wendigo are more common. The Boneskinners lore even seems to be based on the wendigo - it’s implied to be a kodan transformed after commiting cannibalism.
---
He had silly peak head, one massive and one small arm and wide legs back in GW1, so what now?
---
It’s such a generic design, it’s probably not outright theft as much as two different franchises going with something unoriginal.
---
Really my person, if you think those two models are identical, you might want to get your eyes checked.
---
The better thing to do is reply to your ticket and ask for it to be escalated. While it's true that Anet employees browse this sub and respond sometimes, it's first and foremost a community organized by the players, and the average person can't help you with a ban. We have no way of knowing how true your story is, so go work it out with the people who do.
---
its just a water elemental from gw1 basically
---
We cant help you.
---
Talk to support if you do not know what exactly you were banned for.
---
If you do, be glad ANET didnt perma ban you.
---
&gt;obviously the same design
---
To the extent both are made of ice and shaped like a human, yeah, same design. 
---
But if you actually compare them, point to point, it is "obvious" that they are completely different takes on the "giant iceman" idea. 
---
That's why we're getting so many "so what" comments. 
---
Seriously, how many times are people going to argue that generic fantasy designs looking similar is an issue?
---
Oof
---
You have to understand one thing. 90% of the GW2 community are retarded casuals which can't believe that you can be good at this game or do some research before you start to play it (to avoid mistakes) especially when you're new. Most of them it took few years to find dps meters and this kind of basic stuff. They came to gw2 from other f2p asian games and this is their first experience with western mmo. They never played real mmo before.
---
You can't play hardcore in gw2. Hardcore scene totally died here. Gam is only for casuals and new players. I recommend you to go back to WoW and don't waste your time for gw2. Or try FF14. Almost every hardcore gw2 player (and guild) moved there.
---
I usually just manually level my characters.   
---
I like to learn how the class functions step by step, and some of things that work early on do not work well later. So it is nice to acclimate myself into the difficulty that can come later.
---
Thanks, I hope this actually draws up attention from a dev just to clear up my situation.
---
Just for my curiosity, how well would a comp with only one support Chrono with your build hold it together? Like, instead of the 'mediocre second Chrono' you mentioned, what if we had a DH with Feel my Wrath or a power dps Chrono with SoI or Well of Recall and maybe Time Warp?
---
Only 2 other things that can teleport. Sometimes when you log out the character and log back in, the game forgets you were on the new map and then remembers. It'll throw you at the beginning of the map instead of your last log out spot. I doubt he logged out to cause this. The other method would be he was on a map that was closing. The map closed and the map forgot the character was on the map, remembered, then threw the person to the beginning of the map. 
---
I still don't think either of these two scenarios happened because none of the entrances to the map are a cave with mobs in it.
---
Gw2 copied and is boring nowadays.
---
They did the same with the Fraenir this last release. Its the Arenanet special.
---
IMO neither of them look inspired. Take a human shape, bulk it up and add some ice chunks to the arms/shoulders, done.
---
……of course, thank you captain xenstroke obvious!
---
It's not ogre 'til it's ogre.
---
He already knows about arcdps and taco but is blissfully unaware of what botting is. How convenient.
---
Currently no guess re: Sett, as his splash doesn't give a very good idea of scale. I'd likely ballpark him at well over six feet tall though, and certainly a hunk.
---
Don't you think it's hypocritical to demand positivity / optimism towards anything said about anet; but will immediately and for no appearant reason bash players who might be wronged by them? 
---
Personally I like seeing this thread be full of typically "optimistic" players bashing on someone. Really puts the subtility in blatant whiteknighting.
---
Clever
---
I'm glad you got it appealed but the responses here jumping down your throat and thinking Anet can have zero false positives when banning is just pathetic.  I guess since most of the non-Anet fanbois left the game the reddit is basically just full of Anet white knights these days
---
Getting downvoted doesn't mean you're right, no matter how much of a persecution complex you have.
---
I think I might be in the minority who will advise you to use the boost.
---
A friend of mine recently tried GW2 as f2p and it was painful to watch him slog through the leveling process. No exp boosts or tomes etc from daily login rewards to speed things up, limited access to the trading post (so it was hard to have gear with the right stats at his current lvl) and other restrictions made the process unnecessarily slow.
---
So if you plan to get the expansions anyway, just buy them now and save yourself some trouble. You get 5 character slots if you buy the expansions so if you want to level a character the old fashioned way you can always make an alt and do that. 
---
Also you should know that if you go to low level areas your character's lvl is adjusted so you can still experience those areas even after you hit the level cap.
---
Besides, with the power creep we have even with just the core specialisation updates over the years the core game doesnt pose much of a challenge (with the excpetion of Orr maybe), so I don't think that there is much to learn by leveling manualy anyway.
---
Welcome to GW2! Have fun!
---
No. Its same artists who made it. They work for both companies. The problem is they give us worse version which looks like a draft
---
You want to complain about something worth complaining about?
---
Complain about [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dagger_Training).
---
It's the only stat trait that gives 80+80; and the cherry on top? It gives NOTHING ELSE!
---
But you love me more than the data, right? :)
---
I'm happy you found it useful
---
Sure thing mate. Anet never "falsely" banned anyone because they're incompetent. Players like you certainly didn't bash the players that did get banned - without doing anything wrong - while blindly siding with anet.
---
Didn't it take someone literally nagging anet on GDPR legislation for months just to show they were wrongly banned while they were consistently bashed by players like you? Oh yeah that sounds just about right.
---
Add me to your friends list! My flair is my in-game tag.
---
"Can I copy your homework?"
---
"Yeah just change it up a bit so it doesn't look obvious you copied."
---
You can use an [Infusion Extraction Device](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infusion_Extraction_Device) which costs 24 silver to remove Infusions before you stat swap.
---
Stat swapping is useful if you want to try a new build, but it is not something you should do too often. If I were you I would get 2 sets of trinkets for those stats and then slowly get 1 set of mist trinkets from fractals, PvP or WvW which can be reset with a [Mist Capacitor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mist_Capacitor)
---
&gt;edit: man, all you redditors think I'm a lying cheater who was botting. If I cheated and got banned I wouldn't even bother sharing this with you guys. Sad. I'm not crying for help on GW2 subreddit, just sharing my experience and wanting to know if this happened to any of you.
---
There's been A LOT of history of people claiming they were banned unjustly but later were revealed to be lying.
---
Statistically speaking, any post such as this one is far more likely to be untrue. Hence the reaction. 
---
I'm sorry if you're honest and saying the truth.
---
To be fair, ice theme is one of the most boring to do, because everything is bland icy, and all similar.
---
Wow man, that's like... wow that's a great post.  I'm gonna quote it.
---
&gt; You are right, they aren't. However, when one ice golem looks identical to another then you have a problem. White knight Anet all you want, it's quite clear they ripped off the design from ESO
---
Yeah pretty sad since you actually needed skill/coordination and preferably fractal god for it to be as efficient as it was, pugs trying it thinking they'd become rich easily would likely get like 5-10g/h.
---
Wish they added the timer but at least didn't rework the fractal, haven't found a single person who liked it.
---
This and the pocket raptors waiting outside!
---
That's a "yes, that's Braham"
---
&gt; 3 Guilds who won on their servers in GvG,only they can fight on WvW maps
---
Bad idea, because it puts a restriction of ~50 people from each server who can play WvW. What we are all hoping for WvW is to get updates to bring more players in, not to drive away the ones who still play.
---
Your idea can have some merit if Obsidian Sanctum (or some other custom map or whatever) is used as an arena where an Automated Tournament style of gamemode is impemented and adjusted to make it appropriate for GvGs.
---
I just started playing Skyrim and it's wild how many similarities there are. Nords are basically normal-sized norns. A few npcs have the human female voice too.
---
Never had to kill anything to get out. Just swim to the surface.
---
That there'll be WvW alliances one day.. [right? ..right?](https://i.imgur.com/dTcAHZcg.jpg)
---
i would look at wooden potatoes yourtube channel against the wiki and watch  the vids that match
---
The only similarity I see is that they're both into bell bottoms.
---
we're out of luck, since arenanet failed as company xD
---
Leveling really isn't that hard for vets that have hundreds of Tomes of Knowledge just sitting in the bank. 
---
I'm not that active anymore myself since most of my wvw buddies aren't playing and wvw itself is slowly dying. 
---
But as far as classes go I've always prefer Rogues. (Yes, every character even in Skyrim turns into sneak-bow) So... Medium armor. I play other classes if i'm bored or to just goof around, but my mains are the medium armored classes simply because they resonate with me the most. 
---
I also like killing people in a open-world-ish setting so wvw is where i use to hang out the most. I'll be playing Deadeye or swap to Soulbeast if i feel like it in solo-roam. Holosmith, Soulbeast or Dare-Devil if some buddies decide to roam a bit and we get a group going.
---
PvE bores me to death lately. I'd rather play something else at that point.
---
Yeah, I thought the timer was fine.  it's amazing how anet can move mountains, and get stuff done, and completely rework an entire fractal quickly when people farming it, but it took 3-4 years to fix the clown car in underground.
---
The reset to "beginning" of map thing only seems to happen with disconnects. It CAN get more severe where the game doesn't even know which map you are supposed to be on and it throws you into LA instead. I have always wondered what would happen to a free account which hasn't got access to LA yet if that happened but I have no reliable way to recreating it to test.
---
I like to do the wack wack and flames effect so I still like my warrior even after 5000hrs. (other classes I've played combines to around 500hr for compairson)  
---
the class has mobility when in combat (gs,bull rush, multiple leaps) and can bring buffs if want (banner/EA) and can be pretty hard to kill (endure pain/defiant stance/dolyak sig)  
---
but really i just like to do the wack wack and flames...... all the flames......
---
Well, they both have one clubby hand and one pointy hand.
---
Deadeye was one of the classes that mad me stop playing. Not because I hated it but because I played it in the spec preview for PoF and loved the shit out of it and the montages people were making were amazing but I wasn't close to leveling to that in the live game so I just got meh and stopped playing. I haven't tried playing since then but I really want to play now so im hoping I dont burn this time.
---
How much creative license can you possibly have with an anthropomorphic block of ice?
---
Assuming you really didn't do anything which would be ban-worthy, what might have happened is that a GM noticed you standing around and suspected you of botting. What GMs then usually do is to try to talk to you and see if/what you respond. If they don't get a reaction, they port you and see what the character does then. If it looks like a script just running back, the assumption is that this is a bot running back. This is because the character apparently is reacting to the port, but not to the communication. Maybe you just missed that? I do know players that are really not paying attention to that chat box and hide it as much as they can. I know, it is a strange concept to block communication in an MMO, but could that be what happened to you here?
---
That's probably the case, I wasn't paying attention but usually I do reply to whispers.
---
Ooooo I know lots of thirsty bois who would want to help.
---
Just set yourself a goal to have 9 characters of every class at level 80 with unlocked elite specs and full ascended/legendary gear and slowly work towards that goal.
---
There was a post a couple days ago, not sure if there's a fix but you're not alone.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/e7r83s/my_hero_panel_c_key_always_opens_to_the/
---
Gold sellers use those.
---
Flavor. I have all the classes fully geared and specced but I main Necromancer for the flavor. I just like that type of archetype in every game. WoW I was a Warlock and DK main. Oddly ehough, Paladin, too and Druid. But DK and Lock were my main two.
---
I'm playing Divinity Original Sin 2 as a Necromantic Cleric type of character. In ESO my main is, you guessed it, Necromancer.
---
You don't have to heal in raids, you can heal in Tier 4 Fractals. That's where I heal all the time as a Necromancer.
---
Good to know I'm not the only one.  Thanks for the link! I missed that thread.
---
"That's..... What have they done to ESO's magic?!"
---
Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty.
---
&gt; 	Network issue. Failing to get connected to Guild Wars 2 may be caused by the routeur or by a network server failure. If the problem remains, please contact the online assistance.
---
I've played almost every class to some extent, but Necromancer is by far and long my most played. With over 6 years invested in this game and over 5k hours in Necro alone, I'm still not tired of it.
---
What keeps me playing it? I think if you can find a class you enjoy, it'll eventually be the right fit for you if you have the patience to stick with it through the learning curve. I imagine there are a lot of people that picked what ever class looked the coolest to them with little to no prior knowledge of how it actually worked, and yet still use it as their main today simply because over time, familiarity made it the right fit for them.  
---
This is some what true for myself, because Necromancer was one of the first classes I played. I stuck with it because I enjoyed it and eventually it felt natural to me. As time went on, it became my "home sweet home" that always feels good to come back to after playing something else.   
---
But, more about _why_ I'm interested in it and why I keep playing it; because speaking from a player versus player perspective ( not necessarily PvP, but rather WvW small scale, roaming, 1v1's, etc. ) I enjoy the challenge of not having a safety net. I enjoy that I'm entirely reliant on my own skill to survive and not on passives, blocks, invulnerability, etc. I love having the power to _remove_ power from people. And I never get tired of having the potential to turn the favor of a group fight if I'm supported or left unchecked.  
---
Necro is never boring to me despite having more play time on it than some people have on their entire accounts. I'm not bothered by many of the things people complain about when citing it's weaknesses. All I see is how much of an impact I can have if I play well and how easily I can make a lot of meta builds irrelevant because of my boon corruption and removals. I just never get sick of being that one thing you really can't be careless around if the player knows what they're doing.
---
I dunno, kinda like the unconventional way revenant works.  Learning and mastering the usage and drain of energy. Making the most out of having two sets of utility skills. Making builds based of the half build principle all of the revenant trait lines follow. The difficult and punishing condi rotation for raids. Mastering constant dodging and movement for PvP.
---
Something about it just felt right, you know?
---
You're right. It's been a while since I got drug under. I do remember swimming towards the light now.
---
I got a problem with you feigning ignorance about what botting is.
---
Also thief has no recharge on weapon skills
---
What a dick thing to say
---
it was from ranked
---
Removng stronghold was a dick thing to do.
---
Initiative is the recharge time
---
Wouldn't dwarf stance be better with Vengeful Hammers instead of dragon stance? That way you get basically permanent uptime on Forceful Persistence.
---
Makes you wonder why
---
Wishing ill on people you never even met or interacted with; your lack of maturity is showing, child.
---
Go to google images and type "Ice Golem" every of those has some similarity with the golem from gw2 and eso
---
This really isn't the place for that
---
NO SHHHHHHHHHHHH CAN'T HEAAAR YOUUUUU

i am deeply sorry for all three of you. however that doesn't excuse you being such a dick. good day.

It's business as usual. Chinese companies in general tend to not give a fuck about copyright and IP law. For another example, back in October, Paradox Interactive "released" their new mobile game called Stellaris: Galaxy Command. It was outsourced to the Chinese company Gamebear.
---
Galaxy Command was not only a blatant reskin of their existing game Nova Galaxy, it even had obviously stolen art assets from various games, [INCLUDING HIGH PROFILE IPS SUCH AS HALO](https://i2.wp.com/techworm.page/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/download-5-11.jpg?zoom=2.625&amp;w=708). It took less than a day for PDX to pull it and post an "apology", and I haven't heard a word about it since then.
---
What they did was wrong. Having it in the game harmed nobody but for people who enjoyed it losing it was losing a big part of the game.  Anyway, if they need to layoff 100 people better he bad employees than the good ones.

Virgin Icebroof Construct vs Chad Frost altronach

Thank you to everyone who participated in the survey. At this time, the survey has ended and the winner of the $25 dollar gift card drawing has been notified by email.
---
Stronghold was being used by win traders to get to high ranks. The low playerbase allowed you to virtually set up custom matches with the ranked rewards. They had to remove it.
---
Well if you are laying off staff, you have 400, need to dop 100. Do you choose 100 good ones or 100 bad ones?
---
What does this mean? (sorry I’m a newbie lol)
---
Actually, the rabbit hole goes deeper than that. You know the "orc" race from Skyrim, the muscular humanoid race with tusks? It turns out, that there is actually an old book, Lord of the Runes (or was it ruins?, anyway) that has very similar race. And not only that, this book also has elfs as humanoids with pointy ears! Just like Skyrim, can you believe? If this doesn't have Illuminati written all over it, I don't know what has.
---
Hmm. OP says their ban was magically appealed and Dorn isn't here. Is it possible that ANet is not perfect and that, until they manage to be perfect, their ban system should be more descriptive? Nah, let's be snarky dicks because the majority of people banned are doing something wrong. Surely there is no real world social issue which this parallels.
---
Simplicity and being able to (mostly) relax.
---
What is wrong with a month, i suggest you go read posts where people say, thinking of picking up the game what should i know, and the replies will say, get TaCo and Arcdps, so its totally nothing for a new player to the game to get these overlays, 
---
I suggest TaCo to a friend who picked up the game as a new player, as it can be a great resource espically for world boss timers etc.
---
This has less to do with not having someone to "press a button" and probably a lot more to do with not wanting to make changes while understaffed (everyone is on vacation) just on the outside chance that the changes blow up everything.
---
Revenant actually gives me the same feeling, It seems like such a cool concept that only exists in other games. You dont see them much in MMO's.
---
&gt;	Maxwell–Huber–Hencky–von Mises theory, where several people got similar ideas while working independently.

---
This is a pretty cool reason for what you play. Thanks for the comment!
---
it's quite common for people to break rules and then post on reddit acting all innocent..however, it's also extremely common for anet to stupidly ban people that didn't deserve it!
---
your mistake was running back..you see the GMs that handle these things aren't very smart people so you have to go out of your way to prove you're not a bot! maybe type in /s chat "wtf why you port me you minimum wage braindamaged employee?" or something nicer maybe!
---
oh i just noticed your edit..good job anet! never change
---
i freaking loved this comment, i hope you are beeing sarcastic lmao

hfb is still easiest to find,not enough tryhards i guess. funny part is,that half ppl wana play with hfb and half ppl dont wana play with hfb. 6 ppl left my pt,before i got some which were ok with anything XD

Those are two completely separate teams that have nothing to do with each other and encompass completely different profession skill sets.
---
Again, I'm not suggesting that "because it's not like GW1, there has to be an explanation," but rather that the geography of the region in GW2, on its own, suggests something happened. I only briefly mentioned the GW1 version as a bit of extra context.
---
Go look at the area I'm describing in GW2. That village is hanging on by a thread. There's no way this was just a different interpretation of the same area. Something happened there.
---
You gotta make the meme for the upvotes lol
---
These are working humans just like you and me, why would you not grant someone free time?
---
Not to mention that adding/removing stuff from a store has a much lower chance of accidentally blowing anything up.
---
Cant choose league starter tho :l Explosive Arrow and Vaal Burning Arrow look insane but I havent played caster in a while so maybe Fireball build? Caustic Arrow and Scourge Arrow looking juicy too &gt;.&lt;
---
Condi Mirage is really fun, top bad it sucks in fractals.
---
Ah I see. Well a dps guard can still make use of the scepter for both power and condi, and sword for DH.
---
I might do ms or arc to start
---
Yes, how dare they take vacation and spend time with their families during the holidays. The nerve.
---
hasn't ms get kinda rekt tho?
---
guild wars didn't invent the ice elemental
---
They are going to get as much money, as they earned. No one is going to pay them for just being "human", we have enough of those.
---
Holidays should the hottest time for them, instead they fuck off more than two weeks in advance. Well, thats a good way to get permanent "free time" when their customers will all fuck off too.
---
To maybe avoid unnecessary discussion, my point is:
---
Corporate is in charge of what is happening with the game, the employees do what corporate say, as its their job, and bashing them for going on 3 week holiday is just nonsense to me.
---
And I feel like there's A LOT happening off-screen. When has my character become so buddy-buddy with Sayida that she's ready to throw whatever she'd doing away just to help us in Sandswept?
---
&gt;And how do you know how man hours they put in over the year or when they had free time at all? 
---
Look at the the OP post.
---
&gt;Imagine you hate on your co-worker because he gets some freetime.
---
Co-worker? What? I'm a customer here, hello. Lets say, I obviusly have more free time around holidays, who is going to get attention from me? An entertainment company that releases content and makes (non-recycled) events around that time? Or the one that refuses to work? 
---
No wonder things in a-net go as they do, if they make suck utterly retarded decisions.
---
Bladestorm or Lacerate for me! Going to live up the cheap melee league with either Berserker or Gladiator.  Champion. Is semi appealing too.

Is Death-Branded Shatterer a world boss?

What... do you mean? Don't tell me there is a bug where you stay at sitting position if you enter combat against an specific enemy in that area...?

Can't vouch for pvp unfortunately. This is pve meta. Guardian rotation is straightforward, haven't played the rev

Data to back you up, or stop spreading your own opinions as facts.
---
You must not have been introduced to WWE!
---
I have one of each class, most of b them  with at least 3 PVE builds.. and almost all them geared for fractals T4... Which is not that impressive around here, but makes me happy ..😄. I simply play what I feel like depending on my mood, recent game updates.. or simply which fits better.
---
it takes away nothing in pve(they are still dazes briefly though)
---
this build is a joke anyway and comes from a person that doesn't understand how boons work at all..or the whole game really
---
overcapping so much is pointless but you've already been told that by many probably
---
you can only give alacrity with shield to sub2 unless you put yourself alone in a 3rd group and pray for rng which is extremely stupid, kinda like your build really

Bar fights would be so Norn ;)
---
When there's no other explanation, changes in terrain are due to the dragons shaking the whole world when rising.
---
Any recommendations on what PvP reward track to follow?
---
Or I got distracted or burnt out from trying different classes? Lol you're like "you wanted to play gw2 because it looked fun but because you dont play like I do means you're an idiot". Out of 50+ comments you're the only person who seemed bothered by how I do things.
---
yes get pof if you like the game but do not skip to level 80 you will be lost in the end game.
---
I'm not interested in my main anymore, and I'm waiting so hard for class swap on gemstore someday.
---
Nothing, I stopped playing shortly after templates hit. My main was engi and I'm absolutely sick of glorified Holosmith that carries whole class, while core is in pieces, not to mention unfunction gyro.
---
My money is still on the right. He can take a few hits. Lefty is gonna shatter on the first blow.
---
He'll never get to use his fancy pointy poke if he can't even survive the first 5 seconds.
---
Anet does not deal in logical. They prefer long drawn out events whereby players complain and then stop playing. 
---
It makes no sense why they can not implement such changes now, yet they rather let WvW continue to tank
---
Cute. Chalking it up to the dragons.
---
I’m an Asuran Necro main although I have all but warrior and Engi rn. I have 3 builds for Necro: a Reaper, Scourge and vanilla Condi. I stick with him because it feels, to me, the best match for my playstyle. I also have a bond with him for spending so much time using him. Trying all the other classes, nothing clicked to me like the Necromancer did. Reaper is good for when I’m too braindead to think too. Just Spin2win lul.
---
I’m working toward this. Except 2 PCs build and I’ve only done 2 1/2 classes
---
Aah yea, I didn't even think to check comics. Good shout.
---
It's the "A wizard did it" of Tyria.
---
And you're in Gold???? Dang brah, gimme a build or something
---
EU
---
I just don't want to miss those few moments when the whole team coordinates. You got one guy calling the shots, people communicating how far they are, what they're doing, and we end up stomping enemy team 500-100 or something. Those games are the best when everyone's cooperating.
---
That's some **serious** BS right there.
---
Ice Atronachs have been present in TES franchise forever. You haven't discovered anything new and certainly not a copy from GW.
---
In that case, make a new chat tab, but only tick /team and only use that one tab :-)
---
Little known fact, they are also both bottoms. Not power bottoms, but condi bottoms. They like to start slow and ramp up.
---
Maybe they're just nowhere near done with alliances so they're trying extra hard to kill off the game mode to have more time for chairs and cats
---
I just want to say, I regret you've been downvoted this much. Even if they didn't deliberately rip it off, it's hard to believe nobody on staff knew about the one in ESO.
---
now do the same on the maelatrom course
---
I feel similar about thief and deadeye. Thief used to have some difficulty at the time of being able to face a similar-skilled enemy, but now with deadeye you just can permastealth and wait until they fall asleep on they keyboards to burst them, or just flee away in stealth.
---
On that note, sylvari also have some interesting details in HoT that the other races don't, so sylvari is a pretty solid pick
---
Holy crap I wish I could load map assets that fast.
---
&gt;What  
---
  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;What's wrong with the fraenir?   
---
Pls don't tell me it's fcking Talon Silverwing or idk
---
I did the vulcano cave in one of my vids, but you can't do the first, smaller cave with the sharp curves unfortunaly. I can do Jormag's Fang, but the Beetle is to slow to show a nice side by side race. I may do Diessa Plateau in the future.
---
Reminds me of the bug you could do within the first year of gw2, where you could summon an infinite amount of flesh wurms as necro (only cated by the regular cd).
---
So you could have like 50-100 golems up at a worldboss or WvW Keep...
---
That was fun times
---
True   
---
GW1 is like having happy, excited and curious young Talkohra going onto a journey  
---
Gw2 has an undead, desperate, crippled Talkohra laying around .\_\_\_.   
---
Atleast MOX is fine. Oh man, that guy...  
---
Oh and that one Earth Henchman. The one in Elona. Shje joined the Zephyrites, then became an Exalted and in the end landed in the player ivnentory nomming bloodstone dust.
---
Herta.
---
A Griffon master ! Griffon adventures are the only ones i can’t do :-(
