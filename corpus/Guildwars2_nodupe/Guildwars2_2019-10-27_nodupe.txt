and isn't it rude to be a lazy fuck and not bother searching an easy to find answer?

---
oh i forgot this is gw2 subreddit where being a new player makes you new to the internet as well
---
just like in game! when new players don't use chat because they aren't high enough level to unlock basic social skills right?
---
Forbidden OTP.
---
But there IS a [confirmation windows](https://imgur.com/KxYtbE0).
---
Wow, it's that one post on every online game subreddit I've ever been to. Hello again old friend.
---
Yes, the first LAUNCH trailer, not alpha test trailer. An alpha test is how they test the game. The launch trailer advertises the game and gives it direction. It tells you about the game.
---
The LAUNCH trailer, shows something that is clearly not a PvP scene or game, and mentions the Guild Wars as a historical event. People who were buying the game at launch would have known the guild wars were a historical event. This wasn't something that was made up and added later.
---
It was there from the very beginning.
---
Nope, they just said the "We worked on this game for a long time" part. Adding anything else to it is like being that family member who insists on talking politics at every gathering, no matter how many times people try to discuss something else for a minute.
---
Let’s be real though, how many of these were only gemstore updates??
---
I doubt those skills are up to par too tbh :)
---
Difficult &amp; rewarding and SoI boonshare imo are not sentences that I understand well together (especially if we are talking in the days of lesser signet of inspiration), but I won't argue. Your closest modern equivalent if not Chrono itself would probably be Firebrand, but even that is simpler. You could always try to push the DPS a bit: trying to maintain 100% uptime while doing as much DPS as possible on all three of the modern common hybrid boon supports (chrono, firebrand, renegade). "Difficult but rewarding" probably better describes some DPS builds than support builds mostly now. There's a big difference between the best Mirage players and the decent Mirage players for example.
---
Different strokes for different folks, I hate dailies and don't grind for achievements, nor do I like pvp and wvw, so for me there is just not a lot of content that feels at least a bit fresh, and I'm not alone in that group. But I do agree that a new player will usually have a wonderful time especially with how cheap the game is
---
I'm just triggered by the fact they used "it's" instead of "its".
---
I've also worked on my book for a decade. It's a piece of shit still, but by your logic people can't tell me it's a piece of shit.
---
Ok, sorry to hear that. But everything can be compared to something else and be found better (or worse). Doesn't make the one thing you are comparing (in this case the GW2 subreddit) suddenly any better.
---
It is tho, did you actually think there are more than a handful of people playing PvP?
---
Research on gambling and impulse purchases has shown that the fewer clicks it takes for instant gratification, the more people are prone to engage in both schemes.
---
So yeah, it would hurt ANet financially. I'm not saying it's why it is like it is, for all we know it could have been a honest fuckup, a classic ANet thing.
---
...you win.
---
No, I’m not having a stroke nor do I feel any of those symptoms but thanks for asking. This comment is to display a similar scenario or an analogy so that another redditor who acted like he understood what OP meant could understand. Does that satisfy your questions? Can you use any of your cognitive abilities to simply understand what that means? Or do we need a doctor here?
---
You telling me you cant count to 12 using 2 hands champ?
---
I'm cautiously optimistic. Now that my expectations are grounded, I'm hoping ANET can modestly build themselves back up and someday do something big again.
---
Regardless of anything I've said to bash ANET in the past, NOTHING was ever personal to the developers. I only wish them well in their endeavors, and my negative comments were only out of tough love for the game.
---
I am excited to return to the shiverpeaks, as I have been anticipating since 2012. Last patch was really a step up in immersion and Charr culture, so I look forward to see what they do with Norn.
---
Nothing you've argued is relevant.  Your simply pointing out that all the issues can be circumvented through in game play.  Well no shit, that's usually how pay for quality of life cash shops often work. You can pay or you can grind. It doesn't change the fact that Anet purposeful makes the quality of life lower in the game to incentivize buying quality of life cash shop items.  Its also doesn't make Anet bad for doing things that way.  Op asked why their was so much inventory clutter, I gave them the answer.  Your offended because for some reason you consider Anet monetizing the game to be a bad thing.  
---
&gt;With 0 additional bag slots and nothing more but cheap 18-slot bags, you get 72 inventory slots in addition to the 20 of the starter backpack, amounting to 92 slots for free in total, which is more than enough for everything by far.
---
This is false.  Players with many builds frequently run out of inventory space.  Its not uncommon for some of my friends to not use certain characters just because their inventory is full. I've done the same thing.    
---
&gt;  The only difference between someone with cheap 92 slots and and three 25-stacks of salvage kits and someone with 150 slots and a copper-fed is that the 150-slotter can pop more unid's at once and doesn't have to run to a merchant at some point.
---
Yup, the game is designed to be more annoying unless you pay for quality of life either with money to gems or gold to gems.  What's controversial about that?
---
&gt;Anet actively and overwhelmingly toned down the clutter by turning PoF-based unidentified gear game-wide
---
If Anet actually wanted to tune down clutter, they would have removed salvaging all together, drop the salvaged materials directly, and automatically put them into your material storage.  An example of this system is seen in zelda skyward sword.  Again, Anet intentionally makes the game quality of life lower, and allows you to buy a higher quality of life.  Not controversial for anyone but you.  
---
&gt;Anet provided massive amounts of additional bag space per ingame rewards in form of ascended 32-slot bags
---
Bag slots are in game rewards too, so this is a bad argument.  They can also be earned by paying money, which is my point.  The quality of life is purposefully made low, you can use money to raise it.  
---
&gt;Anet even implemented one 32-slot bag as a reward for a collection
---
Irrelevant, all 32 slot bags can be obtained through in game play.  They can also be skipped by using real life money.  
---
&gt;Anet provides you with free shared inventory slots to reduce even more clutter, across your entire account, through various means like throwing your unid's in there, or your mystic salvage kit, or ...
---
Yup, shared inventory slots are a huge quality of life feature.  That is why Anet sells them.  Why do you consider that a controversial statement?
---
How low RNG%loot make any difference ?
---
Still 99.9999% will be trash.
---
[removed]
---
With the current Extra Life thing, let's hope they show something to us as donation goals when they stream for the event hehe.
---
it must be nice not having standards. i wish i could have fun just clapping rocks together too.
---
I suppose I should say complex?  LesserSoI Chrono had a lot going on even if the base concept was simple, and while I personally didn't see it as being hard I saw a lot of people during the SoI nerfs talk about how they didn't want to get into Chrono because it was hard.  Add this to the fact that I've found a few other professions I've tried have been pretty easy to get my head around and not very difficult to feel competent at (with the exception of base engie), and I just kinda figured Chrono was difficult comparatively.
---
In regards to dps, I generally prefer playing supports in games because it seems like they tend to have a wider variety of mechanics and abilities, both thematically and visually.  In the example of Chrono, creating and using phantasms to help spread boons was fun because it was something kinda unique and felt like it added more depth to the play style.  I will say I enjoy mirage though, getting my skill timing down so I have a near permanent uptime on mirage cloak feels nice.
---
However I will look into firebrand and the potential of returning to Chrono, though the last time I played the latter it felt a little disappointing having boons I couldn't share.
---
... If you're going to be like that, you can count to any number with 2 hands. What was even your point? 
---
... Did... did you just want to show off that you've learned to count?
---
Did you want to show off that you can use a google search for a random reddit comment?
---
core game is not free to play, it's free to try. There's a huge difference in gameplay experience when masteries come into play, old personal story looks clunky and silly when compared to modern episodes, trading post restrictions are heavier than what most people realize, mounts, gold 2 gem market, laurels, huge limitations in spirit shards which translates into mystic forge caps, locked-raids, World vs World limitations, etc...  
---
Compare to being restricted to vanilla wow maps, without raids, without mounts, without any reliable way to earn gold, without auction house, with characters restricted to "vanilla-only skills" on a Battle for azeroth environment. That's pretty much what you get 'for free'
---
While i understand,  i don't appreciate gaming companies bloating their games with nonsense only to sell a convenient solution to a problem that shouldn't be there in the first place.  Its a method that directly affects the quality of the game and the user experience.  The amount of loot i delete in this game is too damn high!
---
That set up would certainly make more sense from a functional standpoint. Reason I have them facing forwards is to mimic the antenna of the beetle when stationary. I'll do a revised one with skids facing  backwards and forwards, with the backwards facing ones taking the role of the forward ones now, and the forward ones being re-assigned as an equivalent to a kickstand - that is to say, their function being to ensure the vehicle stays upright when stationary, so when stopped; all four would be on the ground.
---
Tybalt last stand and finding Gwen's grave were the two most emotional parts of GW2 for me.
---
I lol'd. 8/10 shitpost
---
While not breaking any rules it definitely does alter the game files. You are changing how the game is rendered. It's not just an overlay like TacO. And while I doubt they are gonna ban us, it's not completely safe.
---
I just did Claw Island recently and this hit me in all the feels.
---
A new build could mean they just changed a typo somewhere in the text.
---
There wasn't 100,000 patch's.
---
If I were you I would probably try getting into clearing the fractals and try to do the challenge modes. It should be really easy getting into tier 1-3 without any problem. Just look up a guide and get a decent build. Challenge mode can get harder to get into because most of the community is a buch of cunts that require kill proof for trivial content but try to make the party yourself. 
---
But if you done em' a few times each there is no real reason to repeat that content so I suggest you leave for a better MMO like ESO or Final Fantasy XIV.
---
Its anecdotal but I was in the same situation. Opened a ticket, answered all of their questions and support was able to locate my account. 
---
I'd 1000% times recommended trying to get your account because each character will have gotten birthday gift for each year. And it has a lot of really good stuff.
---
MSI afterburner - free software, can show FPS CPU/GPU performance temperature and much more on all game screens
---
I really liked Logan and was surprised that he seemed to be playing second fiddle to Almorra. Wasn't Logan supposed to be taking over as Marshal and they were going to confine him to a desk because no more field marshal dying suddenly
---
You can't directly, stat-selectable weapons just let you select once.
---
If it's the Ascended version, then there's a Mystic Forge recipe to let you pick different stats.  This will actually turn the weapon into a brand new item, so the skin will be removed and need to be replaced via a Transmutation Charge.  The Mystic Forge recipe is 5x Ectoplasm, an Anthology of Heroes, the Inscription for the stat type you want it to become, and the Ascended weapon.
---
After just one week your new account was more valuable than your restored account?  Even with accumulated birthdays gifts, higher AP value, skin unlocks on your old account?  Even if you did not upgrade the original account with gem store items like bank tabs, skins, and other goodies, using the new account over the old one after just one week seems like a bad idea.
---
If he were still alive.
---
indeed, spring roll is only for 80lvl
---
you can use minor sigil of speed, no lvl needed -  Gain [Swiftness](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Swiftness) (10 Seconds) on Killing a Foe, although its not that 66% movement speed, but still nice
---
Yes just stay off the reddit for your own sanity.
---
You'd be right if there wasn't a confirmation window. You go to buy something and then you have to click a second window that says purchase. What this guy is looking for is already in the game. He just wasn't paying attention.
---
Weird. You have the same clothes and dye pattern as my necro lol
---
what a weird coincidence!
---
Nope, still clunky. I switched to Firebrand, feels more useful.
---
I'm actually sorry to tell you, but this looks like one of most generic and uninspired looks in gw2.
---
Too soon.
---
The recent changes make it possible to run full viper or berserker without trouble again. Chronos middle Grandmaster Trait grants AoE quickness for every shattered clone.
---
Does it change anything about the lost F4? No. Was it a nice change that gave incentives to play Chrono instead of Firebrand? Yes. Did anyone notice that they changed the trait in the last patch. Not a lot of people.
---
Of course this only matters if you already have an Alacrigade in your party. You also deal about the same damage as an offensive Quickbrand with less Aegis uptime.
---
no, they only tell you its shit at every opprtunity. Even when you just think about the font you are using.
---
I don't think you are going to see anything from the gray infusion when you are using all black dyes since is applies what is already a very subtle black outline.
---
Bit of a trivia question, which boss is the largest by size? Doesn't have to be most powerful or most tanky, just the largest in appearance.
---
As far as I know, the infusions don't stack, but I could be wrong.
---
Reddit tends to be bitter sometimes that way. Most people whom I know outside of reddit and play gw2 are super happy about the game even today and continue to play.
---
So did dragonhunter. So did condi berserker. Melee is BiS for damage with all classes.
---
The grey one is a very subtle effect, I don't think you'll see it on black armor. I've used it on white armor and it does appear as an outline.
---
Only the dps chrono is enjoyable imo. Playing boon chrono just feels like you should be playing FB or Alacren. Since it's not that impactful.
---
Reshade puts the FPS on topp right of your screen. I think you can change where it goes too
---
1 certain infusions don't stack. Second as others have said make your whole armor white then add and remove whatever has the infusion. Trust me you will see it.
---
thank you :)
---
Some people like competition, some just like to hover their mouse over loading screens.
---
Me when two DPS run into AoEs in opposite directions and die, while I'm at the boss spamming mantras: (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
---
┬─┬ノ(ಠ益ಠノ)
---
These people are completely oblivious to how stupid they sound. Unfortunately when they do dumb shit, like salt mining on a post about internal builds, they make it much harder to take them seriously when there might be a genuine, constructive concern.
---
Yeah, and while GW2 does have issues (worst I recall recently was Kourna patch day) it doesn't usually experience the same issues games like ESO is experiencing this weekend (multiple server downtimes to fix server issues). It's so weird trying to log into another MMO only to find the servers are down for maintenance.
---
There goes my true first videogame crush.
---
Eh, make the teq. tokens tradable for weapon chests.
---
&gt; can be combined into refined currency at the rate of 1000 to 1
---
Only do this with Candy Corn. Sell the other 3 to the NPC
---
"Fixed a server crash"
---
mornin, all that on twit bio!
---
More loot = less bag space = more bag sells in gem shop for anet. Simple as that.
---
Does "motivate" or "encourage" sound better to you, which in this context basically means the same except it's put "nicer"?
---
oh thanks, i actually scrowed down a bit in the thread and found your twitter lol. How much did you charge that dude for this piece?
---
Think of the children!
---
How much content (story, achievement, whatever) would I be missing out if I only play one race? Planning to level one of each class but only one race attracts me.
---
Personal story up to the level 30 chapter. At 40 they join up and the choices aren't based on race.  
---
No achievements, as far as I know. 
---
Sylvari have a few slightly different bits in Heart of Thorns, which are cool but not game-ruining if you miss them.
---
You can use any sword and change its appearance to look like your preferred one with transmutation charges.
---
fraps is another tool that can do this
---
What I mean is, it was never *challenging* in any of its content, and as far as I remember that was intentional, which I appreciate. I want to relax in my free time. My job is challenging enough. That seems more like the target audience of GW2.
---
I mean you can play whatever dps you want as dps, people really shouldn’t care as long as you pull the numbers
---
The story from 1-30 is unique per race with 3 different paths in each. After that they start to join together and branch based on what order you join.
---
As someone born and raised in the apples and hops part of Washington, I always loved Tybalt.
---
HoT zones have a nice level of challenge. LS3 and LS4 both have nicely balanced zones with challenging content. Even PoF, which is largely empty in many locations has good pockets of reasonably challenging content.
---
The new map is pretty, but it’s quite obviously a low-key “intermission” map intended for farming and showcasing the beauty of what the team is capable of, and I applaud them for that. But it’s highly unlikely that the Saga maps will continue that trend - you’re fooling yourself if you think they will. 
---
If you want to chill and walk around picking plants, then there is the whole vanilla world for you to do so. I completely disagree that challenge-free content is what the majority want.
---
To add to what was already said, if the sword was ascended you can [stat swap it](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing), if it's exotic just get a different sword with the stats you want and in both cases you can [transmute](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Wardrobe#Transmutation) the skin onto it. The important thing is you unlocked the unique skin anyways and got that part of the collection.
---
Hi,
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The size of my name is not normal on GuildWars2, i'm looking like a serial number of a product
---
Problem with that, no one can contact me due to letters limit on the game
---
People can join me only if i sent something first.
---
I made some Helpdesk Request but they don't have a clean solution.
---
They offers me to rename my account but they also warned me to i will have some corruptions in the game which will occur on some situations
---
I cannot accept to fix a problem to have a lots more...
---
They refuses to offer any price reduction in game to compensate the bug which [Arena.NET](https://Arena.NET) and NCSoft are responsible
---
My account became like that after fusion from NCSoft to Arena due to i'm an old player from GuildWars1.
---
The Helpdesk support keeps being death and refuse to do anything for me.
---
This is an issue which is not tolerable, to create bugs into my account and nobody takes any action to get rid of them or offer any price reduction in game for the discomfort to play.
---
People can't contact me in any way, excepted if i message them first...
---
So please help me to solve this issue and to reach their Manager, so i could have the proper solution and play with full features.
---
My English may not be perfect, but the French support fails completely to help.
---
Are you going to tell the battle-hardened, veteran, apex predator with a personal grudge that she can’t go kick a big crystal lizard in the nuts?
---
I was hoping this would work for me, but the highest driver my card supports is 425, while release 430 is required for the in-game overlay.  :(
---
I hate Logan with a passion... But this is amazing!
---
What open world parties in WoW?
---
The more convoluted systems, milk players better. Just look at the anthem pre orders.
---
just ask in your ticket to have it escalated to a senior GM for review, contacting Anet support here breaks subreddit rules, so it will likely be removed.
---
Keep in mind that a senior GM most likely wont be able to change your name without possible new bugs either but you might get some compensation or refund out of it.
---
Also, if you update your ticket, write in english first and then french again (in the same ticket) to maybe get your point across, as they are probably bilingual anyways
---
there is a simple way to reach a higher up: ask in the same ticket you opened simply that it gets escalted to the next higher gm in line.
---
Thanks! This worked for me.  
---
Configuring the utility was tricky, but this video was a big help:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUS3zx0DlHg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUS3zx0DlHg)
---
Because of morons like you the game is a clicking fiesta.
---
How Manu gems u need
---
You have a picture so I can see? I already thought the Peerless Infusion would go really bad with it, but I would like to see it.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/djvl49/what_is_it_with_these_lags_in_elona/
---
I was afraid the Chaos gloves would go over the Ember infusion indeed, which is a real shame. I was hoping the Ember infusion would override it but the "glowy" part of the Chaos gloves would stay. Thanks for the elaborate answer!
---
I think you might want to edit your post slightly. You're missing the word "not" between "he's" and "disappearing". Makes the post sound like you want him gone
---
Isn't that the point of infusion overload? None of them look good with more than one on, they all clash hideously. Even one is pushing it in most cases.
---
Getting new card would have some good benefits then. Both actually being able to see FPS and also being to be able to have double digit FPS :))))
---
I mean do you really need a screenshot to imagine how horrible blue, pastel purple and orange/black/yellow is gonna look?
---
I'd be damned if I intend to waste even a single cent on them
---
You're right, I guess I can wait another couple of days. I waited 5 years, a few days won't matter.
---
&gt; No mount. No gliders. Back when it was populated, the atmosphere there  was way more casual iirc. It was a place for us to level up alt's; and  meet the new players. Semi zerg vs zerg fights did happen quite often. 
---
And players that flame you if don't do what the zerg does, EoTM was queensdale champion farm all over again. And that is a experience I don't want for new players.
---
 Nobody cares. This sub is about art.
---
Well that wasnt very nice of you was it, did you have a bad day sport
---
I dont think anybody is arguing that selling QoL through the gem store isnt a big part of Anets business model. They only had a problem with your argument that Anet is intentionally designing game systems to make your game experience feel awkward unless you purchase those QoL improvements. Many QoL improvements (especially regarding inventory management) were introduced free of charge. Unid gear was already mentioned, the Wardrobe is another, salvageable sigils or new mats getting a place in the mat storage and salvage/open/consume all options are also examples.
---
Most loot or game systems arent perfect when Anet releases them but their flaws are often only realized much later, which can either happen through wrong predictions on how the player base as a whole is interacting with these systems on a long term basis, through other additions to the game (we wouldnt be complaining too much about having to store so much different gear for build diversity, if Anet never would have introduced so many new stats and elite specs) or economic changes over time. Many of the drops from festival containers we now consider trash, actually had some value and purpose when they were released but over the course of 7 years, we just farmed so much of them that there is a glut of oversupply or better options from other sources were introduced elsewhere (food).
---
But I agree in general that the T&amp;T bags could use another overhaul and if we give some good feedback, we might see some next year.
---
Wintersday gifts, which were in my opinion the worst offenders in bad loot management and loot table composition got a great overhaul in my opinion when they introduced the snowflake exchange and switched from 6 different tiered snowflakes to only one.
---
If their main goal with wintersday gifts was to spam your inventory in order to make you buy bag space, why did they introduce the new snowflake system in your opinion?
---
In the context of power banner berserker, what does cancelling the after cast on tremor entail? I've tried moving and weapon stow and both don't noticeably change the cast time.
---
Pretty sure berserker would be better than assassins in all those scenarios, including open world.
---
Warriors inherently get decent Fury uptime, and sigil of Accuracy is more than enough for crit chance.
---
While having 100% crit chance feels very good on paper... In realistic scenarios having the higher raw power numbers is almost always better, even if it means staying at 90%-ish crit chance instead.
---
It's nice to see this sub is in firm shill hands again, after everyone who cared about a good game left. :)
---
Ok stupid question but I havent played in a while.
---
Can I buy only the living season episode that you need to grt that new flying dragon mount or do I need to do them all in order?
---
you got flamed harder for potentially interfering with the k-train in EotM than for bringing a ranger into actual wvw.
---
Idk bro have you seen joko’s harem? He has harpy and a choya
---
Oh, thanks!
---
For the skyscale, you need the whole of LS4 - it has collection items from each of the maps. 
---
I think LS3 and LS4 are both worth the cost of admission.
---
You only need to buy all 6 episodes od season 4
---
&gt; I don't think the EBG and BL's are suited for the brand new players who just installed the game.
---
You're right, but for the wrong reasons. They're not suited for brand new players because those players will be worthless. Your friend needs to go suck it up in PvE to learn how his profession works before he can be of any value in WvW.
---
Didn't know EotM had account restrictions, that's pretty stupid.
---
So yeah, agree with everything.
---
same.
---
&gt; They apparently don't pay enough servers.
---
Possibility number 1: you didn't pay enough.
---
Possibility number 2: they are greedy and don't use your money properly.
---
Possibility number 3: the lag is on some middleman in a certain geographical area so some people in one area of the world have the lag while others don't.
---
interesting! That's something which could be investigated.
---
My ping to AWS in general is quite good, also I don't have any issues with other AWS-based services. So maybe the code they required to spin up new AWS instances or something isn't as reliable as it should be?
---
It feels like the server just fucks itself up sometimes. Rarely I (and others) get disconnects and when you reconnect to the map, the game is suddenly fine (although the map was completely reset).
---
Elona only. Happens in Crystal Oasis during Pinata, Desolation while killing daily Joko minions, Vabbi during FwF.
---
Has been like this for around a month or something: https://i.imgur.com/VYPif33.jpg
---
of course, but they'll earn less profit in the long run if people leave because of these issues. I for one am playing significantly (30%) less than before and if these issues continue, I'll probably completely stop playing as my free time can be spent better with different activities.
---
Just give it the same rewards as the other maps.. I love that map but the rewards are garbage compared to the other maps. It was so fun playing fear reaper builds and running around with the Kodan transformation you get at the forge.
---
&gt; the lag is on some middleman in a certain geographical area
---
what do you even mean by that? If you have a global CDN/cloud, the mesh infrastructure of the Internet should balance these issues out.
---
Since share-online.biz got taken down and I'm living pretty near to DE-CIX, I doubt I have peering problems. I also doubt that there's a problem with a reverse proxy somewhere because I have had these issues with about a dozen different IPs in different locations according to GeoIP. I'll make a comprehensive list ASAP.
---
It would be fucking perfect, but Anet acts like it's Zojja.
---
First of all: Excuse my snark. I mentioned I'm a network admin and you still tried to explain how the Internet works to me.
---
&gt; But, you are not sure right because you haven't checked?!
---
How could I ever be sure? I already ran wireshark to see if it's dependant on a single IP, I already graphed my ping to various test servers around the globe to see if the lags occurred when I have a bad connection or bad peering, I already tried over different WANs with different technologies (LTE, Cable, VDSL)…
---
If you have any suggestions on what exactly I could check, I'm totally open.
---
&gt;Imagine the internet being a vast network of streets and intersections
---
No I don't. I worked as an IT Infrastructure Consultant for five years and I'm currently continuing studying high-frequency engineering, the Internet clearly is a series of tubes.
---
&gt;the internet has certain hub sections that most of the traffic can run through.
---
DE-CIX is basically in my neighborhood. For servers in DCs "directly attached" to DE-CIX I have a ping of 2ms. Guild Wars 2 servers on the other hand always give me &gt;10ms.
---
&gt;don't you think that if that would be the case then a huge amount of people might be affected than just the couple you have encountered?
---
I'm the master of edge cases. Also a problem is not just a problem if it's encountered by a majority of the users.
---
I'll explain it in terms you understand. There are houses with people in it. Some people go to work, others don't. Some of them even work in the same company. Other people from the same company don't live in the same neighborhood. Only the people from that exact neighborhood have problems coming to work on Tuesdays because Joe from accounting eats his Donut on his way to work and drives more slowly, leading to a higher entropy in traffic which in turn makes people come late. The company solves this by firing Joe because they have detailed logs and know what to do.

Now if only there was client-side logging for Guild Wars 2…
---
&gt;download WINMTR or Pingplotter
---
No. Why?
---
&gt;get the ip through /ip from inside the game
---
Why can't I just use Wireshark for this?
---
&gt;look where you have a lot of package loss
---
The first good tip coming from your post, thank you. I currently investigated ping, bandwidth and jitter, but package loss seems to have been pretty consistently low. Maybe I can combine looking into individual IPs compared to package loss.
---
&gt;If they start at an address relatively at the bottom of the list and the host address is something arena.net then it is an ArenaNet problem
---
That's wrong. You could have issues a few hops earlier and it'd still manifest as routing problems to an arena.net host.
---
&gt;then you should put a ticket to the support because this will get buried here on reddit.
---
For that I'll have to find out where the lag is coming from first. Maybe I'll write a small utility to check connectivity to GW2 servers.
---
&gt;If it is not an ArenaNet problem well then it is an ISP problem and you should let them know.
---
I doubt it since I checked with three different ISPs.
---
&gt;PS doesn't mean anything in terms of lag because the one is how many frames are rendered each second and the other part is the connection and response to and from the server.
---
Depends on your definition of lag. If you have 1 FPS and you press a button, when will you see what the button does? (Hint: it has something to do with the "per second" part of the term FPS)
---
It's a weird balance when people say something isn't "worth it", because the second it is worth it, the price would adjust on the TP. The only outlier is the extreme Longshot of something like an ember infusion of course
---
How about No? If he can not join WvW it means he is on a f2p account and the level cap is there for a reason. You can make as many f2p accounts in this game as you want which means you can troll other servers and to a point were you really hurt the server you trolling. If you play WvW i am sure you can imagine how bad this could turn out.
---
And EotM is nothing like WvW at all. It never was anything like WvW so bringing him there wont teach him anything. Tell him to get the expac and he can join WvW when ever he wants. I think though that he might have to go through the portals in Lions Arch to get in before he unlocks the icon on your upper bar. At least it was like that a while back but i could also have changed, either way he can get in to WvW if he upgrade his account.
---
I am building a power s/d Weaver and my question is this: I see that SC and Discretize advise 3 assassins pieces; can this be any 3 pieces or preferably shoulders gloves boots?
---
" my PC is in the upper-mid-tier category. "
---
Yeah bud that has very little to do with network-type lag, which is what you're describing.
---
Download an app called winMTR ( [https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/) ), run it overnight against [www](http://www).[amazonaws.com](https://amazonaws.com)
---
Take a look at the report, that will tell you if its your network, your isp, or some hop between you and anet.
---
Happens outside of this too. It feel like logging in to WvW and to SM three way fight and the only thing you see is a few players in amnon and some you pass on the map. 
---
Ofc it also happens like you say when there are meta events up but it does outside as well.
---
I will be mean, but I work at a helpdesk so I will bitch. First of all, to a helpdesk guy your case means jack shit, so (I'm assumimg here you wrote to them the same way you are writing here) could you please make it easier on everyone and ask someone to check your grammar and word choices? I understand, not everyone is a native or has grasp of a language strong enough as to communicate, but for the love of Luna, you are mistaking one basic word for another basic word, as if you were a guy in India. Assuming you didnt lie, you should be at the very least 25 or something like that. Ask your friends or guildmates, I am sure there is someone who is better at english than you are.
---
The assumption that you're 25+ might be wrong however, because your demeanor and the way your post sounds suggest you're a boomer with the 'I want to speak to manager' haircut or the male equivalent of it.
---
Next, it's a pretty well known fact that this game has spaghetti code and that there are no og programmers left, so if they screw up something old they are screwed because it will take more effort than it's worth.
---
Finally, you're trying to shoot the messenger. It wasn't helpdesk that told you to screw yourself, it was their supervisors and devs who told them to tell you they won't fix it. 
---
A tip tho, it might be labor intensive for them, but might be less of an issue than trying to maybe not screw up code for a huge game trying to fix one guys account. 
---
Are they able to change your account name to something shorter? 
---
Or alternatively, I think that they should be able to arrange for a new account with all/most of the stuff you have now and link that one with your HoM if you're persistent enough. 
---
Tldr, you're bitching that someone who is just doing a grunt work was told to tell you you're a lost case.
---
Like the game isn't already a eye-fuck clown fiesta. But you are right. I am sure they will. There is no stop to gem store aggressive monetisation after they had the audacity to add build templates feature there. .
---
Wanted to return to this game again, but I have a question regarding PvP.
---
Is it still so infested with bots or does Arenanet ban those players now?
---
"so why did you take 7 years to charge people for something that was easily accessible and free in your first game"
---
"Money c: "
---
&gt; Let them grind up some levels. It should be a place for them to prepare for the real WvW borderlands.
---
how are they going to grind for levels? 
---
at lvl9 they're going to get curb stomped by anything they encounter.
---
It also seems more ppl have a similar issue. Support is known to react properly for these matters is the case is true. Hope they will react soon enough for you though!
---
Maybe now the community has learned to not yell ''I'd pay for this!!!'' at every little thing
---
Great, thank you very much for the answer!
---
Hopefully there's a pattern because I totally said "I'll pay for this" when they announced guild wars 2 and it became vaporware for a few years then it was made free.
---
&gt; If their main goal with wintersday gifts was to spam your inventory in order to make you buy bag space, why did they introduce the new snowflake system in your opinion?
---
I think Anet did this to streamline the experience.  Just because Anet sells QOL through micro-transaction doesn't mean they only sell do that, some of it is included with the base game.  You get 250 mat storage with the base game purchase, you buy the other 1750.  
---
Also, to be fair, the old snow flake system allowed you to store a lot more snowflakes for free.  You could store 250 flawless snowflake, which in the modern system translates to 2500 regular snowflakes.  So at least in some sense, Anet reduced free storage with this update.
---
i miss EoTM days, Necro and Warrior with their CC on fall damage trait was the most fun thing oh and hammer Guardian, just wish the other BL's and EBG had mechanics like this map do
---
Yeah I think this is the main issue. Trolls will always ruin the game for 90% of ‘Nice’ players.
---
I can't tell where that is
---
LOL using tradition dating to 1996 as an argument for shitty game mechanics
---
i just found out: something like pawned for gw2 existed during the launch o.O
---
beware, german post: https://archiv.wartower.de/forum/showthread.php?t=1073247

quality! the guard is the icing on the cake
---
What I'm building only has the goal of being a local method of quickly and easily storing and loading your templates to/from your clipboard.
---
&gt;  it's really no excuse to leave a 10-15 minute encounter of awful game design
---
&gt; but far too often this means standing around a clump of crystals waiting for the boss to finally attack you
---
It has been so many years and ppl still dont know how to do the fractal properly.
---
You should be killing the tentacles whenever they spawn, they deal as much dmg to the boss as throwing a crystal, so stacking crytals in 1 spot when you'll need them close to the tentacles while killing it is contraporductive.
---
The boss cant get dmged twice at the same time. So killing 2 tentacles at the same time or throwing a crystal while a tentacle is killed, results in the boss only getting a single dmg proc. A lot of pugs split at the tentacles and kill multiple tentacles at the same time, which is contraproductive.
---
The fractal is pretty boring and badly designed, but ppl in general make the frac take twice as long and more boring than it should be.
---
&gt; The cause is the lack of community management.
---
Also case of "community" being bunch of dicks that don't even play the game anymore.
---
Don't know if you heard or not, but ANET has had some drastic reductions in staff.  What is left is going to be taxed just getting new content out.  Reworking existing content in light of the staffing issues does not seem like the best use of limited resources.
---
someone who quit at level 9 wouldn't stick for much longer anyway. leveling is so trivial and easy this isn't wow classic
---
There's not a lot of reason to do unit tests after an art check-in, unless you're running infrastructure like Dolphin's FifoCI, so that there's output to compare. Same can be said of changing shaders.
---
I've known other companies, including one that used to be under NCSoft, to literally maintain asset information with spreadsheets, and if a linked resource was missing, it'd be known. Hopefully, ANet has a better system for that.
---
best view is in bitterfrost on top the highest tree, about 45k units up
---
Insinuating design choices insinuates intent. The reason for inventory management is being found in tradition and core mechanics of the genre, not in predatory bag space practices. And that doesn't even begin exploring just how little inventory management there is thanks to vast amounts of bag space or the ability to send materials to the bank on the fly without having to visit a city. It also doesn't even touch at how Anet provides ingame rewards to *even further* lower the need for town visits or inventory management in general.
---
Don't let that change your opinion though. Everything is made up and facts don't matter. Anet bad! Purposefully limiting inventory space! Reee!
---
I love competition, I play several other games competitively (MtG, LoL, Smash, etc), hell, even PvP is decent, the issue is WvW specifically.
---
I will have to search the comment from the devs again. they already wrote down the prices somewhere. I only know 400 and 600gems but can't remember for what exactly.
---
If they gonna revamp it like they did with aquantic then hell no, aquantic was good before and is now one of the most hated ones.
---
I think its fine as it is.
---
There's an achievement early in Heart of Thorns for being a sylvari and taking a specific story path, on beyond the racial storyline achievements.  A player of any race can still earn that sylvari achievement by joining a sylvari player for that instance and letting them get it, though.
---
There's also a hidden achievement exclusive for Charr characters in the newest episode, but it doesn't actually reward any achievement points, it's just there.
---
Hard feels indeed. Tybalt hit me giga hard.
---
Great line selection OP
---
Your the only one saying Anet is predatory.  I said Anet gives tons of lot to sell bag slots and that hurt your feelings. They have to monetize the game somehow, bag slots ain't bad.
---
really? i play from oceania and in most online games that don't have oceanic servers, i get upwards of 300 + ping (used to get 250 on ESO and GW2, eso has gown down a bit to 280 but gw2 is still a consistent 350 +) and i never had any issues with lag in LOTRO.
---
Limiting QoL to sell QoL is by definition predatory game design. You don't have to call it that for it to be like that. You just happen to be factually wrong in that instance. But it's not like facts will have any influence on your opinion. So let's keep it at that.
---
The closest thing to petting your pet is giving treats to your mounts in a few PoF heart quests.
---
&gt; Limiting QoL to sell QoL is by definition predatory game design.
---
Says who? Some rando on the internet?
---
i don't know what you play exactly, but my experience even after all the updates n shit was always the same: it doesn't matter what content you do, even with the generic 100 free slots in the inventory it is so cluttered at some point that you can't even open the bags anymore or the salvaging simply stops because the bag is full again.  
---
no wonder when there are 20 types of bags, bags out of bags and then you get 3 items which unfold into another 5 after salvaging.  
---
at least for now they fixed the runes mess we had before for ages.  
---
farm for 1h at a nice tidy grindspot in bdo an you know what i mean. no fucking inventory clutter with the need to see a vendor. place your horse close and its basically 2 clicks to put the trashloot away so you do not overload. you can keep going and going and going. no need to salvage for 5 mins to keep going. just plain and simple uninterrupted farming.  
---
meanwhile in gw2: hey guys wait, i need to clear my inventory after 2-3 dungeon paths or 3 fractals. even in the openworld you can't loot whole tarir if you do not have the space and you come from another train. you absolutly have to stop. its shit, wastes time and generally does not feel nice because of the whole bagception. the bagception meme is not there because of nothing.  
---
that the whole loot feels totally generic and you get something good once every year doesn't make it any better.  
---
the gw2 loot system overall is simply one thing: trash. might as well play a loot simulator like path of exile...there you have at least loot filters and get good stuff from time to time.  
---
btw this is something i criticized since years and it never got any better for a very few exception where anet did something good. but in the overall scheme...big oof.
---
yeah of course. my assumption from the start was that a build was triggered by a dev actually doing something. if art were to trigger builds as well, the picture would be even bleaker.
---
however, I do think there can be possible uses for running tests when assets change, not much for the assets themselves rather than just doing sanity checks if nothing linked is missing. though obviously the more efficient way to do that would be to have seperate builds (like just a nightly build) that focus on that instead of on every checkin. we often used nightly builds for various long running tests that weren't critical but still good to know if something went wrong.
---
I have a gray one as well, and with armor dyed black it's fully invisible.

Facebook has not been doing continuous delivery for a decade. They’ve been doing it for about five years. Also the microservices architecture didn’t even have a name until about that timeframe, and without microservices, continuous delivery of service based applications is extremely difficult, if not impossible.
---
I’m sure *someone* else was playing around with this idea when Anet started running with it, but I certainly don’t know of anyone, and I was working on services deployed at scale back then (and still am). I knew enough of the big players personally that I’m pretty confident in saying Anet was one of the first to do this kind of thing.
---
No.  
---
  
---
Why? Because ANet isn't competent enough to balance it. Just look at what they did with Aquatic. Stop asking them to ruin another fractal, cause you know they will. It will turn into one of the most hated fractals. Just let them focus on their new maps and LS stories and keep them away from "balancing" patches because they ruin everything they try to "balance".  
---
"Don't fix what ain't broken."
---
I love Desert Borderlands! As long as my team isn't red ... great place for Outnumbered. :p
---
The WvW community that's mostly heared and has itself established as "THE" WvW community is less interested in actual large-scale siege and and keep battles and is more about GvG and organized, medium-sized competition.
---
The desert borderland is a beautiful, magnificent map for actual siege warfare and battlefield engagements, but naturally is worse than the alpine maps for these organized, competitive battles.
---
Since Anet can't touch anything in WvW without its vocal part screeching to the high heavens and most other parties have been displaced by the organized, competetive part of the community, the mode stagnates and desert borderland remains scorned.
---
I can so understand that, I felt like that at times. Luckily atm I'm fairly cough up. :D
---
Train your six-year-old kid to do it is my favourite one
---
It's internal builds and since they spend years making the game before it was ready to be realised, it's totally fair they include that. Patches they realise for us are not the builds they are referring with this number.
---
This is not true at all. Depending on content you should always watch out what it takes you to min max those 100% critchance. With discipline banner and fury (and maybe a spotter buff from ranger) you don't really need that much extra assassin gear. You could calculate the coefficient but at a blasting 200%+ bonus crit dmg (3 times the damage on crit than noncrit) a single non crit coz you had 99% critchance reduces the DPS heavily. There is a reason all power based raid builds are minmaxed on 100% critchance. Just keep in mind 21 points of precision equal 1% crit chance. With that in mind you can min max each contents build for yourself.
---
that was a long time ago, the issues I have started around September.
---
sounds about right. My issues are since September.
---
&gt; arenanet is about to pull the plug
---
they still release new stuff and they didn't pull the plug on GW1, so what makes you say that?
---
nice number for a game in a beta state for 7 years...
---
My guildies took that advice, problem was that they then said they would be back when we get the next expansion, which is a problem now.
---
thank you for linking these. I don't know why we've been downvoted, but I guess it's the #worksforme mentality :/

1) he does not work at ANet
---
2) Using this subreddit to contact support is against the subreddit rules and subreddit staff here do not work for ANet
---
3) Attacking or using verbal insults against another user is also against our rules. I understand you are angry and upset but that is no reason to speak this way.
---
As you are new here take this as an official warning. 
---
As others have explained. It is not ANets fault that you made your account name too long somehow. They can change your name but that causes issues in how the game actually works. It is basically impossible for ANet to fix that because it would require changing entire systems of the core game for something that maybe 0.0001% of players have an issue with. It sucks that it is an issue you may have to deal with but it is not worth the time or money to fix such a minor issue that will never affect 99.9% of players. The post is going to be removed per our rules and you need to just work with ANet's customer service through there. This sub is not official and we are not ANet employees. And another reminder to not attack, insult, or name call anyone else here or that may result in bans from the subreddit.

French Helpdesk dit it first time but they proposed me something i couldn't accept as i they warned me i could have more bugs on my account and they made a list ...
---
I was asking for a fix, not to have more problems in game ...
---
Since i replied that, they refuses to give me compensation so since then i'm insisting, but they let the request die. So i make a new one etc... My account will get a lots of tickets UNSOLVED. So now, i want to join the big boss of [Arena.NET](https://Arena.NET) for so much disaster for a problem which they are responsible for everythings.
---
I phoned to NCSOFT directly a few days ago, they don't have any more customer support since transfer to Arena.NET

You don't just ping aws like that, whenever you get lag you type **/ip** on chat to find out your map's ip and then type it on whatever similar software to winmtr is available on linux.

No offense dude, but for a network admin and  IT Infrastructure Consultant you surely need to be explained really basic stuff.
---
Open squad don't like it because it takes ages to find enemy blobs or got from an objective to another. Organized squads don't like it either because there aren't many easy fight spots and takes long to come back from spawn. And roamers don't like it either because objectives are too spread and it's harder to find other roamers unless you wait at NC which is very boring.
---
All that blaming the vocal minority nonsense you are trying to spread is just bullcrap, because there is not a single type of WvW player that generally benefits from a map that is bigger than necessary.
---
And the issues caused by the size of the map only grow more apparent as the WvW playerbase keeps decreasing over time.
---
lets bake in BS that drag out fights that you cant play around at all, thats good design right?

Re-re-returning player here. Yeah, I had to take a LOT of breaks. I’ve been in GW2 last time when the last expansion came out. I’m pretty adamant about my new character’s race but the class choice is becoming a burden. 
---
So my criteria is, I want some physical attacker. No no light armor classes, as far I know.
---
I’d love a fun and viable class fitting this criteria. But what are my choices concerning viability? I had a Necro way before but that character was just getting too much hate.
---
You make very interesting points with each type of Player. So Alpine satisfies most of the types players with its design?
---
How would you go about or what would want to change the Desert Borderland to make it more appealing?
---
Would you want Desert to be redesigned? If so, would you want to be of a similar design to Alpine but with the Desert aesthetic, or would you want desert to be different in design, just not the way it is currently designed?
---
Go ahead and try to ping one of the ip's that you get from /ip, because I cant ping any of them.
---
Who said I was a network admin?
---
The point was to do a test on his connection in general, not just anet, to see if there is an over-arching issue.
---
Maybe instead of going straight to insulting someone, take a step back and think critically about his situation and a suggestion that was made?
---
Why not just ping map IPs?
---
Easy stat swapping is the main attraction for me. I don't care about the looks thing, except the Meteorlogicus footfalls. I like them. Legendaries have the same stat numbers as ascended gear (IIRC).
---
Bit of the former bit of the latter, I'd say. I remember when people were saying they'd pay shitloads for mount skins, there were at least a few people who pulled a total 180 in attitude towards it once Anet actually were putting in skins for people to purchase.
---
Once season 5 is over they can come back and play it all in one go.
---
After the nerf, I ended up leaving the game too. I ended up going to Classic WoW, and it made me rethink balance in MMOs. I think classes having their own niche is better for the longevity of a game. Chrono had its niche, and it was fantastic. But now, because of Anet's scorched earth policy to balance, it has made the game unfun and gutted an enjoyable and unique class. As a result of their "Balance," many people, including myself, have left the game and will probably not return until Anet backtracks on a few of these less than stellar updates. Sadly I don't see this happening as that would make Anet admit that they were wrong.
---

That’s hilarious because this sub had their torches and pitchforks at the ready when news of recent bans rolled out. I even said it back then “yeah, of course they’re going to feign innocence, ‘oh man, I didn’t know it was okay’” but nah lol, they were actually breaking other rules altogether.
---
I’d prefer they not split the maps 2/1 with 2 alpine and one desert. The desert BL is tougher to defend, so red team always has a disadvantage. I think it would be more interesting if they had all maps the same and switched up which map they used each week. 
---
I actually like desert BL as its harder to defend. It gives a chance to flip more objectives.
---
So what you’re telling me is that you’re willing to either spend hundreds of dollars or effort and time that equal hundreds or possibly more dollars, on the ability to stat swap, and you’re not cool with templates **because** of that? 
---
Lol

If the recent reworks for aquatic and molten facility are anything to judge by the new version would be worse than what we have now. Look at aquatic it went from being a fractal that could be super fast due to player action. Now it has a big time sink with the champ krait before the boss for some reason. The main boss fight now has 3 invul phases like ffs this isnt a cm why does the fight have be dragged out so much longer. Same thing for the molten facility. They did great work speeding up the drilling phase and the earlier phases of the molten core. What they screwed up is the fire tornado's, they can no longer be blocked with projectile destruction/block so thats one less way they can be mitigated for some reason. For the final boss fight every 25% the boss immediately goes invul and has a long ass burrow animation to reappear randomly at one of 4 spot around the arena and there is zero way for you as a player to play around that. Like you cant cc the boss to stop/delay the burrow, there is no tell for where the boss will reappear, you cant force the boss to reappear in a spot of your choosing. Its just give time sucks to make the fights longer than they were for some reason with no way for us the players to speed up those time sucks ie breakbars etc.
---
I actually don't think that it's the vocal minority. Most other types of players have been displaced one way or another. Just try and play PPT and see how you get belittled left and right, heh.

There's quite a few other people who are playing this game as well, you're not special and you won't get a preferential treatment because frankly nobody cares. I know I wouldn't because I don't even know you. There are some guidelines people have to go through, I highly doubt being attentive to extra bitchy boomers is one of them. 
---
At least in my job, there are only two emergencies, people who have problems paying for something, or people who are using bugs for their gain. I guess it's the same for Anet.
---
May I ask what's your job? I'm assuming it's not anything IT related, since you don't show even a sliver of understanding of how programming might be working. This is mostly because you don't seem to understand that sometimes there's no 'clean' solution... This is not going to be a perfect comparison, but I can't think of anything that is not technical. Imagine you have a bottle, and that you want to make one of those fancy sand images inside. You made it, but when you were done you decided that one of the bottom layers is off-color. 
---
I'm pretty sure you will not be able to think of any solution other than starting from the beginning. 
---
It's the same here, the game still relies on 7 years old code made for an engine that is 15 or so. Ofc, they should have better coding practices and proper documentation, but they don't. It's not something you can fix just like that. 
---
Also, I highly doubt that your ticket is perfectly written, as you failed to understand what I have written, the part about me working in a helpdesk, which is why I can make an educated guess as to why you were told there's not much they can do. 
---
Feel free to keep insisting, I'll have only one request, keep me up to date, I might have a good laugh xD
---
One more thing, was I correct assuming that you're roughly 40 years old? 
---
*Let us know and have a nice day!*

Nah

Nope, not a cent. I used the arc templates fairly heavily. Beyond the free ones, I'm not going to get any more.

---
You are not. Go fuck other games, your fan forum game won't mind. Sleep around. Have fun. Enjoy yourself. It's okay to get different kinks serviced by different games. No-one is judging you. That's actually how games work!
---
This is what the infusion does/should look like https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Polysaturating_Reverberating_Infusion_(Gray). The dark colour dye you have on everything makes the infusions already low profile next to impossible to see on all that black dye.
---
Well a major part they wanted were new Elite specs.
---
The thing that the don't plan having an expansion. LW, saga - whatever you want to call it- can't sustain an mmorpg. An mmorpg with no expansion in the foreseeable future is already dead imo. It seems arenanet moves forward to other projects
---
Your not allowed to be excited for Build Templates. Remove this post before the mob get to you. I'm being sarcastic of course. I'm excited for them too sure I'm a bit annoyed with the gem store aspect but I expected it so I'm not losing my shit and acting like this is the worst things since capitalism.
---
I played gw2 since launch for 3 years. 
---
After I finished HoT and played everything this game has to offer I decided to be done with it. I quit, left my guild, said my good byes and went on with my life.
---
But I never could get this game out of my head.
---
2 Months ago I started playing again after over 4 years away and played seasons 3, 4 and PoF and I enjoyed every second of it.
---
I still love my Necromancer to death and think it's the biggest part on why I'm back.
---
I was so great to be back and there was so much to do.
---
Taking a break from time to time or even a year is good and keeps this game from getting dull.
---
This.
---
True history :V
---
I also recently went back to gw1. Currently doing the Nightfall campaign for my first time. I did end up saving Kormir actually, the other mission sounded pretty boring to me tbh. Anyway, it feels weird to interact with her xd. But Elona has been my least favourite campaign environment so far. Even though I love deserts and low-key hated Kaening, at least Cantha eventually got more diverse and visually interesting. But hopefully that changes in the Desolation and the Realm of Torment.
---
ask my friend Charlie, he experimented a lot with ember. A Charred Charr
---
thanks for this!
---
ill try that!
---
Well, it's perfectly easy to see how multiple transformations can't mesh together properly.  They'd have to remake the whole thing.
---
Nobody is displaced. RBL is a beautiful map and when it's full there can be some really fun fights in there, but that size doesn't really benefit anyone.
---
And people meme ppt because it's very close to doing pve, which is not the reason WvW players go to that mode for. But everyone knows it's necessary to lure squads to a border and make fights happen, so if that's what you are after they might even join you.
---
thanks for all the replies guys!  sometimes it's hard to find help in this community without people making you feel like an idiot, which is sad, but clearly there are also a lot of individuals in here that are willing to help.
---
why do so many things getting 50% downvotes? only memes, pictures and random negative/postive  posts get upvotes. this like this and questions get downvotes ( like really why do noobs for asking questions about the game get so many downvotes, whats with that reddit community).
---
and yeah nice story to hear ! gw1 is simply a supreme single player game
---
It works for me. Did you forget to remove the colon and the following digit when copy pasting the ip? Remember to paste just the first string of digits or it won't work.
---
Oh, I should have known.  You're one of _those._
---
Oh yeah, the overwhelming majority of the playerbase has all the right to be *absolutely thrilled*. This is a *huge* update for them and will change the very way they play the game
---
Me, too, a bit. Having .5-second swaps allows me to pop my Chrono, mine that ore node with quickness, and swap back.
---
That's fucking amazing.
---
Guess the low population is just in my head then. And PPT players are not WvW'ers.
---
Everything is viable, but not everything is optimal in every single scenario so groups will tend to stick with current meta builds, but that's completely irrelevant in solo content.
---
The only "physical"-like classes in gw2 are thief and warrior.
---
1. A bit often than other maps, maybe tied with EB. I go there for squad fights just as much as any other map, but I also prefer it to go solo dailies. So for squad fights EB would win, and solo DB would win, but overall all maps mostly the same.  
---
2. Yes. 
---
3. The different distribution and unique features of each keep makes it more fun, but it's a map that is hurt more than others by less population, since players tend to be more spread in it.  Hopefully Alliances will address that. 
---
4. Yes.
---
5. - 
---
6. I like having the shrines and the jump pads to travel faster on controlled territory, and how more of the map is used for combat, without that huge wasted space to the north. I would not mind if they rearranged the northern areas of alpine a bit to be more like that.  
---
I also like how the each lord has unique powers and mechanics and a larger area to fight which is great both when fighting the lord and other players. Alpine could use that too. 
---
7. The shrines and jump pads, and the unique keep mechanics. I'd like to see them in Alpine. Something like this: 
---
 * Garrison: 
---
     * 1 shrine unlocks a owl griffon transformation with attacks similar to the Inferno Hound transformation, but with a Wing Buffet that knocks back enemies instead invulnerability. The griffon also falls slower than players and takes no fall damage, but it can't glide without the WvW ability unlocked.
---
     * 2 shrines gives players an effect that reduces fall damage by 50% and releases a Frost Burst on fall. The reduction and damage stack with the ones with player traits.  
---
     * 3 shrines adds jump pads. They could turn players into owls.
---
 * Bay:
---
      * 1 shrine adds patches of ice scattered in the keep area and on the surface of the water that are slippery for enemies, but give a short superspeed to allies.
---
      * 2 shrines makes the patches of ice on the surface of the water grow into ice bridges that are also slippery for enemies, but fast for allies.  
---
      * 3 shrines adds the jump pads. They could turn players into oozes or put them in snowballs or blocks of ice, then launch them around. 
---
* Hills:  
---
      * Around and within the keep there would be a few spots with a fumarole venting a faint steam.
---
      * 1 shrine. The fumaroles activate and start venting a much thicker steam that gives blind to enemies and resistance to allies. 
---
      * 2 shrines makes the fog thicker and it spreads farther, creating a thick fog that surrounds the keep and fills the canyons around the keep, making it hard to see players in the fog from a long distance, but not affecting the vision as much up close. The blind and resistance are not granted by this fog, that would still be limited to the fumaroles. 
---
     * 3 shrines adds jump pads. They could be thermal tubes.
---
8. I want for Desert the same thing I want for other maps. For example: no PvE-only events. The veteran creatures and the events on the north corners should have some WvW porpose, like recruiting NPCs that  go reinforce scouts and camps or something.
---
9. "If you build it they will come" is not a real thing.
---
I'll admit it did feel a bit same-y, but they still did try their best to make each map feel unique. Credit where it's due despite their limitations.
---
Desolation is vastly different than GW2's version in terms of atmosphere. And the Realm of Torment is... macabre.
---
I plan to take down Factions next! I haven't really made it outside the boundaries of Kaineng, but I'm really close.
---
Feel free to hit me up if you want help, btw!
---
Questions gets downvoted because either they are frequently asked one you can find easily by searching or they belong here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dndmln/weekly_rguildwars2_question_thread_october_26_2019/
---
Most questions are still answered, they just don't reach the front page.
---
As I mentioned, that's entirely dependent on the pipeline, the age of the software involved, how standard/customized it is, etc. I'm willing to bet an overwhelming number of game devs don't follow best practices, either out of lack of knowledge, time or desire.
---
Everything is viable.  Necromancer was in a poor spot for a long time, but even it has recovered somewhat (though barring Reaper it's not likely to be considered a 'physical attacker' in your book).
---
Engineer only has a single melee weapon, attached to its newest elite specialization, so unless you really enjoy Holosmith that might not be a class for you.  Thief has several viable melee options.  Ranger greatsword is strong, as are Warrior axes.  Guardian is very well-rounded, though the build you'd likely be drawn to are Greatsword and Sword, though other weapons tend to magical-style effects.  Revenant has Sword, Mace and Staff as melee weapons, though their attacks tend to have some magical flair to them, which may or may not be what you want.
---
You can, of course, try all this out.  Don't delete old characters you have, because they all are sitting on lots of birthday gifts.  But when you create a new character, take them into PvP once you get outside the starting instance, and check things out there.  There'll be cheap weapons you can pick up and training dummies to practice on, while all your traits will be unlocked in PvP to mess around with.  There's even a few spots with actual NPC combatants you can fight.  Experiment and see what you like there!
---
You're not the OP, neither am I so... ?
---
Where in this response tree did anyone mention they were a network admin? That's farther down in a separate tree.
---
Your targeted hate is misdirected.
---
Quality content.
---
I really hate the mentality of certain mmo players.   I remember all the way back to GW1 , people would always make you share your build in chat before group content and if it didn't match up with the internet meta you were kicked instantly with no explanation.   I had an ingenious Dervish/ Mesmer build that was way better than the current meta at the time and I shared it with no one because of fear of nerfs ( it did eventually get nerfed into the ground, and rightfully so) and I used to get kicked by all the ignorant people, all the time.  
---
When raids were released,  this game slipped into that mental state, hell even old dungeon runs people would rather sit in the lfg tab for 10 extra minutes looking for a 5th player with a meta build rather then just doing it with non Zerker who would've made the run go by only 2 minutes slower.   That math doesn't add up.
---
Point is,  keep doing you,  and don't let others control how you play.  Build templates should hopefully provide an excuse to get the creative juices flowing again.  I just hope share your build or get kicked doesn't come back.
---
Love the low texture rock.
---
Strongly agree.  Also, I'm really glad you compared gw2 to a single player game.  Way too many people use the argument, 'well all MMOs do bad thing xyz, therefore gw2 can do it without criticism'.  Gw2 isn't competing for my money and time against only wow, they are competing against every game that exists that I could reasonably buy.
---
Exactly my though.
---
Every patch i'm hoping to see something about Chrono but i always end up dissapointed.
---
I think that they "tradeoff philosophy" is a the main problem when it comes to balance. 
---
Chrono for example lost Distorsion, it didn't get replace nor rework just purely delete from the spec and they're calling that a tradeoff but for me it's nothing else but a nerf.
---
It takes a big man to admit that your nerfs were justified. I'm still salty about half of ele nerfs, even though it's still meta anyway.
---
I remember prior to LS4 I used to be able to fly griffon super fast across elona maps without stuttering, now if I go across maps ( not even that fast) it stutters every couple of minutes.   Really annoying when you're jumping off a mountain into a swoop for example and it lags for a second and you find yourself on the ground that second later.
---
Did you expect a level 70 scroll?
---
Fail to have interaction with your community —&gt; 
---
Community gets frustrated —&gt; 
---
Blame the lack of communication because the community is frustrated.
---
A gaming community is formed between the devs and the players. Arena net has decided to do fuck all in this relationship. Blaming the aftermath on the players does nothing to fix it, if anything you’re giving Arena net excuses.
---
To be quite fair yes. But i also never look into them i like the surprise 😆
---
2 soon
---
It's one of those "theoretically nice" changes. If it didn't have microscopic range it'd be useful. Otherwise any mechanics intensive encounter and radius falls short. Granting alacrity still sucks ass (random shield goes "wheeeee" in arbitrary direction, people don't catch well at the right moment when it's barely visible in all visual effects bukkake). You still can't self shatter, so pre-booning in fractals means wells and skill swap. 
---
If you have reasonable alacrigate and firebrand just forget about this pain in the ass and enjoy normal AOE quickness and alacrity.
---
I'm glad your excited for it, but as someone who wasn't stubborn and moved on and did raids and used build templates, I haven't dreaded an update this badly since Anet nerfed the dungeon rewards with the hot fractal rework.  
---
I'm glad Anet made a system which includes you, I just wish they had made a system which includes me.
---
Meh... until I have full stacked legendary errythang, templates are cool, but not relevant to me. Template sharing is interesting, convenient even, but not a live or die necessity to enjoy the game. Anet has been careful to not make game utility a financial burden.
---
Maybe actually show them you're responsible so they let you work for an allowance?
---
I find it hard to believe you can't do some small chores for one. When I was a kid I would save up my school lunch money and just skipped lunch altogether. Or my favorite. Pick up pennies and quarters from the ground. I bought two full priced Gamecube games that way.
---
**EDIT**: I also would like to point out. You can always just turn your gold into gems through the gem store UI. That's how I bought all of my character slots that didn't come with the expansions. In fact 95% of my gem store purchases were done that way. Just save up gold. It's not that hard. It's not WoW easy but it's not an impossible goal.
---
Halloween is the perfect event to farm gold by running the labyrinth and hoarding Trick or Treat Bags.
---
Right, an optimized mixture is definitely ideal when min/maxing for sure. You should have primarily berserker gear with certain pieces of assassin depending on the group content (as you said spotter/banners etc).
---
But i meant in specific to the "all berserker" or "all assassins" discussion that i see people having, all berserker is almost always the recommended option if you HAVE to pick between the two.
---
I'm certain this has actually been calculated in a 10 second burst window, and the extra power from Berserker had a higher dps average than the extra crit chance from assassins... Granted this comes at the cost of a slightly worse consistency (meaning 20%ish of the time you'll have worse dps, but 80%ish of the time you'll have better dps, depending on your crit RNG roles)... but the "average" is still higher.
---
I am honestly excited to switch “bounding dodger” for “unhindered combatant” with the press of a button.
---
Anet: Hello I like money 💵
---
You know, it wasn't like this a few years ago.
---
Sure there were some posts of people complaining about small things, but mostly it was cheerful people saying how great the community was, or lore talking , screenshot posting, etc. People happy with the game.
---
But then HoT happened after a long content drought, everything went on the table for a long time and fixing most of the new issues took them from several months to years. In that time portions of the game felt stagnant while ANet didn't provide the results expected. One area was updated but two others fell unmantained, not to talk about bugs introduced by each update that required immediate action but weren't addressed until months later or some that haven't even been fixed yet. Plus lackluster PR and community management (the so called "communication") and recurrent anticonsumer practices.
---
All those little things piled up to vastly overweight the devs achievements in the mind of many veteran players despite the game constant improvement.
---
Reddit is a bastion for veteran and hardcore players, that's why so much negativity is seen here so often.
---
For this sub, the biggest issue is that GW2 is not really enticing to new players, why? I don't know nor I care, fact is I don't seem to find as many newbies now as there used to be, even when there wasn't a free to play modality. So we are left with an strong aged player base while not enough new blood is coming. And this is a big problem that ANet must solve quickly, once there are more happy new players, old angry vets noises will be less common, this downwards spiral of negativity shall self revert, emo vets shall ride onto the happiness wave or move onto new things, but that doesn't matter, individuals aren't important; what's important is that the community will be healthier by then.
---
ANet should decide on what they want for their game.
---
 - Do they want a game that ages well like GW? Well then pamper your veterans. And start your new project already.
---
 - Or do they want to be an immortal game? Well then forget about all those picky users, reinvent yourself and focus on attracting new blood. Some will leave quickly but many will join instead to replace those who left.
---
To me it seems that they kinda decided to take the second option (more like NCSoft made the choice for them a few months ago, I think MO wanted to go the former route tho). But they haven't totally changed gears yet.
---
I would like to expect an aggressive change focused on open world PvE and Gem Store for the mid therm while gradually reducing or completely scraping out parts that didn't work, like WvW and raids at least while things settle down (of course, only an stupid business will let their customers know). At this point I would completely leave since I'm a hardcore WvWer, but the game as a whole shall be way livelier.
---
The other option is they don't totally change gears ever and things stay business as usual, they giving their best for everyone while under delivering everything due to the scope being too wide, some big hits here and there but many letdowns too, continuing to exist for as long as external factors don't change or get intermingled.
---
Oh i do chores. I do the laundry weekly and dishes. And clean every sunday. Its my "responsability chart" and determines if im allowed over friends or field trips. Im a junior in highschool so it wont be long. 
---
Its just i never neeeeeed money truthfully but trust me ive tried 😂😂😂
---
You can earn a character slot by farming enough Trick or Treat Bags in the Labyrinth to exchange for gems.
---
However, the only way to get your very own rock to pose heroically on is via the 7th birthday gift.
---
You need to find joy when life hands you rocks.
---
cos they want you to buy more equipment bag slot &gt;_&gt;
---
Yeah, I think Anet's communication has long been the issue, and that's why people don't feel heard. Like I said, I understand it. It's just overbearing, it's a totally valid frustration, but it's obnoxious to try and steamroll every conversation with it. I'm hoping some of Anet's recently announced intiatives (specifically the dedicated feedback threads with live devs) will have a bit more back and forth, and reduce this stuff. It's partially on ANet to make players know they're heard (saying "we hear you" isn't enough), but it's also partly on the community to stop their overbearing approach to feedback in every avenue they can cram it.
---
I consistently have the highest dps in every T4 fractal group I join. I'm power chrono, adjusted the build a bit and it works great.
---
Was searching for this comment, thank you.
---
Thanks! It's the achievements in after though for the book backpack and such.
---
Have you tried physical labor? I used to mow lawns for cheap, shovel driveways and do basic yard work. It was rough work and today I'd laugh at someone who offered me what I charged to mow their yard but it was a good source of income. I could pull in about $70/100 a week just on mowing and $150 on shoveling a day.
---
I agree that a player without good knowledge of his/her class will be worthless in WvW, but let's not kid ourselves thinking that getting to lvl 60 in pve offers any significant knowledge of a class.
---
The lvl cap is there for other reasons. I suspect is mostly because getting to lvl 60 on a new f2p account takes time and this makes it harder for people to make alt accounts to spy on other servers or to troll.
---
They're playing how they want. Usually someone like that doesn't care about weapon synergy. So...... I'm not sure what you were expecting.
---
OK, I'm an idiot. I'm so use to kits that I think I assumed the Holo Sword was a unique thing just for Holosmiths and it was required.
---
Thanks to everyone who commented, I now realize I can use any sword.
---
Thank you!
---
I'm just going to copy and paste this comment to everyone.

Are you sure you jump at the right time? Every time I did it this year I got trough the window, what is your ping?
---
Tybalt was super easy to love and easier to miss. Thanks for the love, guys.
---
Oh I’ve heard about that, and should definitely be addressed. But wvw balance has a lots of problems in general from what I’ve heard.
---
But I’m a pve nerd and the post was about pve so I won’t comment much.
---
My ping is 51. I just did it the 5th time and made sure to jump as soon as the lightning strikes the window. I even HIT the god damn empty spot.
---
Edit: also others in the same session as me were able to get through
---
Edit2: 6th time....I tried delaying it this time...still nothing. I just fall of the wall in the main lobby. This is beyond ridiculous.
---
Yeah because bugs are as easy to fix as pressing a button. 
---
BOOP. Bug-B-Gone button has been pressed.
---
It just didn't make sense coming from the "correct side" according to progression and ending on the "wrong" side :/
---
I'll admit I generally use the wiki to follow the [Primary Quests](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/List_of_primary_quests) to get me through the story most effectively. That may feel inauthentic to some people but I don't mind it.
---
But yeah, I'd be happy to help if you need. There's a lot to take in, and I've still been figuring a lot of it out myself pretty recently.
---
Thanks!!
---
You can buy recipes for boots from the vendor using candy corn cobs. That'll give you the skin for the collection, if that's what you're after.

YOu don't technically get the clock tower achievement but I'm not sure that's worth the time to learn it.

Ya, everybody acting as if they have many legendaries.
---
When will it go live again?
---
I am working on it, don't get me wrong, but this won't block any progress either way.
---
Lulz. BUG=You're just bad and not jumping at the right time. So it musttt be a buggg right?
---
You don’t need the JP to get the crown
---
mhh that sounds like ping..very weird
---
Expect long wait times for ticket responses this week as thousands of players who never read patch notes and have no idea what is going on suddenly get furious that their "gear broke" and this menu thing for skill panels is so confusing.
---
As far as I know they never did give an exact price. They did, however, compared prices to bag lots which seems to be where those numbers come from.
---
Communicate in a way that doesn't please everyone -&gt; group of special snowflakes gets frustrated -&gt; circlejerk on reddit and twitter to the point of vote brigading -&gt; blame ArenaNet for not licking your boots and providing content that you specifically want -&gt; leave the game, but make it your life goal to visit the subreddit to trash developers for next 2 years.
---
I'm not giving excuses, I'm just tired of vast majority of this subreddit users.
---
How do I travel to the desolation?
---
I made it every year since the 1st year of mad king with no problems as soon as I learned when to jump. This year was no different.
---
Having played GW2 since launch, with WvW as my main mode (that includes the past GvG era) - I'm currently taking another extended break from this game that has little to offer me as a Veteran.
---
I doubt this time around I can fall in love with the game again since it's exhausting at this point with what little content there is to keep me engaged after 7 years and how ANet is handling this game, and WvW, as of late... but at least I'm not stressing over it since I don't care enough to voice feedback for current or upcoming content/features.
---
Over the years I'd had many breaks, and they were much-needed. My first short break (2013) was also to GW1 and loved every minute of it. Made me fall in love with the GW lore and kept me up to date with regard to what was to come in GW2's future. The next one was my first extended break of about 7 months around HoT's release where I played BnS and BDO mainly, ignoring GW2 for the full duration other than a couple WvW sessions a week. 
---
I'm currently on my biggest break from the game since March 2018; 1 year and 8 months. I only logged on to play patches during Season 4 (for about 2 weeks per patch, then I'd leave again). Currently, I only log on to get the LW patches for free and log out without playing it since even playing for 1-2 weeks every 3-4 months isn't worth it any more. It sounds like I've given up on GW2, and in a way I have... but tbh it's healthy for me to do this to a game that honestly stressed me out over many years, especially being a part of the WvW, and once GvG scenes. During the break I moved to WoW having never played it ever, and currently I'm playing FF14 since about 3 months ago. 
---
The breaks honestly has done wonders for my gaming health. I'm more chilled, playing mostly solo now, relaxed in my approach to in-game goals, and most of all... enjoying MMO's again. Once Season 5 is fully released, I intend to come back and play GW2 again. Realistically I'm in no rush.
---
I have no idea if this is an unpopular opinion but at this point I think all issues with it have been resolved. War claw and gliding fixed it entirely. I actually prefer it to Alpine sometimes. They're both different feeling which is great. I would love for them to add a third borderland so we have all 3 unique.
---
I really didn't like it at first, so I think their changes to it and the new movement options were key. I also think it's a really fun map to havok squad in. It feels like you can get a lot done compared to the more open maps.
---
The only thing I don't like about is that it has mechanics in it that Alpine doesn't have--namely the shrines, unique effects the keeps have and the unique guards and lords. 
---
I don't have an opinion about whether it's better with or without those mechanics, I just think there should be parity of mechanics between the maps. It's weird that one team has a borderland that is more mechanically complex than the other two, so I'd like to either see the unique mechanics removed from desert, or similar mechanics added to Alpine (shrines and special keep effects).
---
This also extends to the high variety of lords and guards in desert. The rest of the game mode should either get this level of uniqueness in all battlegrounds or all of them should be the standard lords and guards that are in all but desert.
---
Yes, mobs *do* add a *lot* of flavor to maps, which is why they need to be used sparingly and in meaningful ways. For example, how you can accidentally step on a devourer nest in Grothmar unless you pay very close attention.
---
But no, HoT mobs aren't innately more dangerous than any other mobs, including core GW2 mobs. You can't just go AFK in Orr either, plenty of mobs there will immediately oneshot a glass build, and each mob has its own purpose and single mechanic too.
---
The main difference between HoT zones and others is only the mob density. There is nothing about the individual mob design that makes it inherently more challenging or difficult; just more annoying. HoT isn't a step up in difficulty, only a step up in annoyance, and people who complain about HoT being more difficult are the same ones who skip the trash in Orr or Silverwastes, or only ever encounter them as part of a squad.
---
Even if mob density is high, in HoT maps you're still "just following a boring checklist." Except you have to stop to do chores much more often, and that just makes it slower, not better content. I'd argue it makes it worse, because your objective is being artificially delayed, not unlike a timegate.
---
And if the density of random trash mobs is how you define whether a map has "content" or not, well, that's kind of sad, because that's literally the lowest form of "content" you can imagine. I don't believe that anyone ever goes to a map *just* to kill all the random trash mobs, even you. Unless they're doing it for the rewards, so they'd just go to the one specific zone that maximizes that reward, whether it's exp or drops. But then, if the purpose of random trash mobs are to be a specific target farm, we already have all the ones we need, so there's no point in adding more of that.
---
Again, increasing the mob density does not increase the challenge or difficulty of a zone, and it's certainly not the "core gameplay experience." The core gameplay experience is to participate in dynamic events, and that's what Grothmar does really well. Grothmar is a textbook representation of the core gameplay experience, and we should get more of that, instead of inserting artificial padding by turning the mob density up.
---
I'm not lagging in game, havent for quite a while, it's on your end dude. The only time I lag is during 3 way fights in stonenist castle in ebg.
---
There's always an event active at any given time; and all mobs are like core Tyria mobs. There's never been an open world map that's been more challenging or has more complicated mobs than Orr or Frostgorge Sound; only more annoying, because there's more of those mobs to deal with. But with how AoE-centric the combat system is in this game, and the extremely forgiving dodge, downed state, and rally mechanics, you could pack an area entirely full of mobs shoulder to shoulder and it still wouldn't be an ounce more challenging. It *would,* however, be tons more annoying.
---
I respectfully disagree with everything you said. The core of the game is combat. It's present in all modes. Explicitly avoiding combat in maps leads to boredom.
---
In a tiny part of the map exclusively theres an event. And no, mobs have gotten way more mechanics than core. Breakbars, different attacks than just one, etc. Seems like you're just annoyed by combat.
---
Guys.

It's a *known bug* that clock tower instances can become desynced. It's not always a ping issue or the player's fault. There are some telltale signs - if you're failing the final jump repeatedly, or notice stuttering animations on the debris that blows out the side of the tower, then you should leave the instance and try to get into a different one. Nothing else you can do.
---
It's good in raids, not much useful everywhere else. Still my go-to for pugging Arah and doing HP train, lol.
---
you simply couldve played power chrono. even if people think you are boonchrono, you simply can state im dps. not that kind of a big deal :D. I also keep my "own builds" and still use them.  but I also give in to the meta and arcdps and made extra build for "meta"
---
&gt; adding a different, stronger bonus to the center ruins that could encourage mid-sized groups to constantly fight over it to help other borders.
---
It actually shipped with this... Basically it was a WvW "Skyhammer" that would open (or nearly open... obviously been a while) all non-reenforced objective gates that belonged to the teams that didn't cap it.  Reenforced gates would survive with maybe 1/4-1/2 damage iirc?  
---
At the time, there was much complaining about it and Anet eventually had to remove it.  I personally only recall seeing it activated one time ever.
---
I'll never not be thrilled about a peek behind the curtain. Thanks for lifting it!
---
Softball question: what are you most excited about the upcoming episode? Be as vague as you can!
---
yeah some maps are bugged/out of sync/whatever for some people. had that problem too.. reached the top 2 times in a row, both times i jumped at the correct moment and just fell through the clock into the goo. thankfully the maptimer ran out and a new instance was created. this one wasnt bugged for me and i could finish it in the first try..
---
but that bug is around for ages..
---
Fix your garbage game that I've been playing for years!
---
are u doing it on a charr? cuz that happened for me as well with charr.
---
It's server desync, had it once last year. You basically have to jump when the other people jump since it will show up as just a wall for you instead of the broken clock face. If you get up there solo you are out of luck.
---
My own impression of the original design was that each objective was to become a way to capture the next one in the sequence with some in the alpine maps set aside (The Garrison and towers on either side) to make them more difficult to take and easier to defend.  
---
This was true in EBG as well except that almost every objective can be used as a place to build siege to hit the next in both directions (with some exceptions, especially in red's end of the map).  
---
"PPT" was Anet's original intention for the game mode, with objectives being focal points for battles but not everybody wants to PPT, many just want large scale player vs player and for those, taking objectives is more a means of drawing out often hesitant enemies.  
---
While DBL is a pretty map in some places, I'm not convinced it serves either of those crowds as well as alpine.
---
I did as well- and now it's just like, "Who's this emo dude crying in the labyrinth?"
---
Yeah the dozen or so threads on multiple forums over the years and several other people in this very thread confirming it it "musttt be something else". Idiot.
---
Unfortunately that first piece was always buggy for as long as I can remember. The animation at least, as the physical object was there.
---
Ranger has a lot of quality of life (your pet can res you if you go down and tanks for you). It also has a fun collection aspect looking for all the pets!
---
The only advantage the red team has is that their home keep can be maxed to T3 very fast. The disadvantage is that the red team faces stronger enemies due to the fact that green stayed in that tier and blue played a tier above last week (maybe I swapped green and blue, who knows).
---
I had the same issue. The fix for me was changing instances.
---
&gt; You could have some the point in this statement if this was happening only after build templates announcement - but it's happening for almost year+
---
Many of us haven't actually enjoyed the game for years because of this, so I don't see what your point is.
---
Lvl 70 scroll would've been nice.
---
"And this would probably scar him worse than being stuffed in a blighting pod." - Canach
---
Sounds kind of like a weird mentality - to be so stubborn on your build that is. I find adjusting my build with new stat combos, new skills/elite specs etc. To be extremely fun, so it's hard for me to relate.
---
I think you make a note about how DPs meters make people toxic, but I'd argue that refusing to adjust your play style to a groups preferences is more toxic than a group seeing your damage output. In my experience in FFXIV, wow and GW2 (among others) DPs meters have never caused toxicity and the most toxic players tend to be ignorant of their own faults l.
---
i thought im on r/sololeveling
---
Always too soon.
---
He's going from near infinite to 2 gear 3 build, 6 each max. OP is going from 1 of each to 2 gear 3 build for free.
---
guard sure, even war but how does ele/thief beat chrono when solo?
---
yea you can't shatter for alacrity while running but that's pretty much the extent of the nerfs..you still self-generate all the relevant boons during fights and have huge damage, without considering reflects either
---
it's not as godmode as it used to be, yet far from the way people describe it
---
You could very easily argue that intercepting and redirecting the calls to go to a different library, is altering the game files. Just because they use the directx api doesn't change the fact that it is the api they selected and changing how the rendering pipeline functions is inherently changing the games files.
---
It is true you arent altering any existing files, but you are altering which files are used.
---
Nice try, anet
---
Unfortunately, it's ruled by the Charr and the soundtrack isn't very good, but landscape
---
wise it is very well done.
---
The redone core Ascalonian maps look a ton like Pre-searing if you avoid the branded/flame legion areas.
---
Especially if you turn down some of the unnecessary browns/oranges using ReShade.
---
Ah ok, the only time this piece bugged for me was the time I couldnt enter the tower at the end, maybe just a coincidence then.
---
Just play through the story in the order it was released if you’re interested in that. I personally wouldn’t go for mounts before completing heart of thorns. Mounts make the hot maps feel small and strange.
---
I'm gonna take a guess that you are in California.
---
(Apple)
---
Or they could fix the problems with links, so every server has an active population.
---
"Tiny" populations are particular server problems. Not every server is dead.
---
he can still use build template if its not enough for him, but he can add his 2 most frequent build to the ingame thing for fast and stressless swap. I do not see any problem there
---
🍎 o/
---
Fix your garbage connection. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
tell game to render further
---
Hot take: "content one don't enjoy" is not interchangable with "not *actual* content".
---
I will share with you what I did to get gifts of battles before I was a WvW or PvP player and was strictly PvE.
---
Go to a calm borderland, run to a ruins (the 5 points in the center that are unguarded), cap it, then go in a circle capping the other ruins.
---
If anyone kills you, hop to a different borderland and try again. Movement skill classes (warrior) are good at rotating the points quickly. Stealth classes (thief) will help you disengage if you are worried.
---
I would come home from work and put a couple hours into this. I would stream some shows on my other screen and eat something while my chatacter was just standing on points waiting for them to cap.
---
It took about a week of doing this, but I basically just ran around and didn't really engage with the mode at all. I also didn't really hurt my team because I was just running ruins when nobody was around (it helped that I worked nights and got back when the servers were dead).
---
It would've gone faster if I'd actually done objectives or gone for kills since ruins give you barely any participation, but I still got it without really having to do anything.
---
And you would be wrong to say that.
---
There is a whole science revolving around user-interface intuitiveness, user-friendliness, etc.. Entirely departments or programmers in other companies, including gaming studios, dedicated to this sort of thing. Maybe you should look into that.
---
This is not a system that is easy to understand, you're the odd one out.
---
MMOs are inherently not easy to understand - Such games and many triple-A games are built on the idea of pre-existing culture. That red means danger, that the space bar lets you jump, etc.. 
---
* A person whose never played video games will struggle with this, this has been demonstrated loads of times online in experiments. Simply extrapolate that to how the average player expects build templates to work and how this actually works, and you get the result we have here. 
---
It's not stupidity, the design is bad. And you're being an insensitive snob to the average human by thinking otherwise, and ironically making yourself look as bad as those you call dumb.
---
Teleport to friend item(use it on someone who is there) or do story/run there from first pof map(think you don't even need to do story if I remember right).
---
In a super-meta composition pFirebrand is a DH lite --it isn't a healer.  It just has the utility of F2 &amp; F3 + Quickness.  pRenegade is the "healer" in those compositions because Kalla Elite (Scorchrazor's Summit) has no ICD and that's all the sustain you should need with abnormally high DPS because the phases will be extra short + consumable CC will be used.
---
Like... if I was playing DH Lite (and I don't currency have a pFB setup this way); it'd probably be like 1/2 Zerker &amp; 1/2 Diviner.        If I thought we needed extra healing what I'd do is dip into (F2) and use (5/4) and immediately leave it + depend on Kalla.   
---
Pugging tends to run Healbrand because it's super adaptable (Honor, Virtues) + Mace/Axe, all the innate Guardian utility.  Some people run Minstrel's on it, but I'm preferential to Harrier's myself.  It generates a ton of aegis uptime and has more stability that you should ever need to play with decent players.
---
Obviously if someone has in their group description  META ONLY Expert only etc.. whatever,  Yea, respect the rules presented by the party owner.  
---
Did I really need to clarify that ?
---
I was in the same boat until this year. I used to do it first try each year and fsr this time I had the same bug. Tried over and over again until I noticed people were getting points for jumping way too late ( they jumped into the wall after the clock for me ) I left the instance, joined a new one and it was fixed, did it immediately.
---
PvX is a blast from the past. And blimey I don't recognise any of the hero builds...
---
Yep, same thought. They should all be as complex as Desert or as simple as Alpine.
---
It’s a great map to havoc on. Love running it with a small team of 5-10, as you don’t normally get steamrolled by a massive zerg, but still run into enough resistance that it’s not a snooze fest.
---
inb4 jade maw now has legs, can walk and goes invuln every 25%, a tentacle spawns and you gotta chase both that and the boss around the map! something something retaliation!
---
also some more random trash mobs spawn every 25% as well and they spam so many boons not even spb bubble can deal with!
---
and that fractal has a severe lack of puzzles! no circle to cap, no magical floor to uncover, no ball to push around etc.
---
Looking back at it, calling the build Condi might be a stretch. I guess it was more ingrained into my brain to call it Condi Mesmer. Other than hearing that Scepter was a garbage weapon all the time, it was always said that "there's a Scepter, must be Condi". 
---
In reality it served more as a mix between Condition and Power I guess, since Rampager's is major Precision and minor Power + Condition while Carrion major Condition and minor Power + Vitality for the extra survivability. So I had my trusty Greatsword as my ranged weapon and my Scepter for low-range/melee range and my Focus for that sweet pull/swiftness. Had a moderate amount of condition but if I was met with Condition immunity, I had a moderate amount of Power + Precision on that gear too. Something like that I suppose.
---
After 1 week or raiding without templates I converted some of my extra character slots into 'build characters'.  I parsed my gear out and now to swap builds I just swap characters.  I had this system in place before arc build templates was a thing, but when delta released their system I was so happy to consolidate them down to one character per profession.  Oh well.  Guess gw2 is back to where it was 3 years ago.  
---
By forcing delta to stop supporting build templates 2 weeks early Anet probably lost some money from me.  If they had shut down arc templates the day they rolled out their system, I probably would have paid at least a couple times to avoid move all that gear around.   But now, I'm definitely not paying to move it all around again.
---
best map for afk farming camps :)
---
Just get Arcdps then. It's easy to install. Maybe TaCo has it as well, idk.
---
Ofc I won't do that, I got my meta builds + their supportive gear stats and weapons ready. 
---
For anything other than group content however, I got my trusty Core Mesmer.
---
You don't need more as a casual player, but when you do more of the 'hardcore' content it becomes very clear that it's limiting. As an example I have 5 different builds for a single character for *one* raid wing, so 2 just doesn't cut it for me. Not even 6 that looks to be the max number right now. :|
---
You can also go to any of the other starting zones and complete it, so you’re higher level when you go back to Keaser. When leveling new characters, I’ll typically complete all of the lowest level, available zones, and am always being down leveled throughout.
---
In the start it was support Chrono or go home tbh and I suppose it later died out but that was too late, but yeah the builds I have ready are Power Chrono and Condi Mirage. No tank/boon duration support for me, don't want the game to feel like a Holy trinity MMO personally.
---
I've got a static of people who do well below meta DPS, on off-meta classes and sub-optimal comps, from a WvW primary background and we manage to clear most raids.
---
Attitude matters more than builds or meta imo. Most GW2 raids are easy enough, the hardest part is getting a group of 10 people with social skills and an attitude to enjoy the game instead of going on a witch hunt for the worst DPS or the person failing mechanics.
---
Inexperienced raiders, off-meta builds, low DPS, none of that matters as much as the people you bring with you.
---
As dps, your only role is dps. Get big numbers on anything and everyone is happy.
---
pchrono [90k+ peak openings in fractals](https://imgur.com/a/YdcXZf7)
---
You can't really replace one without reworking most of the group comp. Maybe the group will end up with more overall dps, but going against the meta will take your lfg longer to fill.
---
about the same price as just buying a whole new character -_-
---
good troll, almost couldn't tell
---
No, I am NOT crying... *sobs*
---
You can get inside of basically everything with a warclaw, but nice vid :)
---
The problem is the instance you're in. If you see that first debris you have to wait for and it stutters before it settles into place, you're going to have a lot more trouble making that last jump. Figured it out a couple of years ago, though I'm playing from Australia and have a fairly high ping.
---
When that happens I try to get into another instance and if I can't I come back at another time.  Pain in the ass, but I don't think this is a consistent problem that is easy to track down. My guess is for a festival that last 3 weeks, when most servers are probably fine, they don't get as many complaints as you think you do.
---
Thousands of people doing it, a few dozen complaints for a 3 week festival isn't going to make this a high priority.
---
Anyway, that's your workaround if you're interested.
---
That’s really weird. I’ve been mad tower for years with 250ping and only had occasional issues jumping into it (usually when my lag spikes)
---
I gotta ask, are you trolling with this post? I can’t tell because if you are being genuine... then there is so much wrong here.
---
You do realize you could have created your own groups to clear content with no limitations?
---
Also those meta groups were there to get it done as fast as possible, either for token farming, gold, etc. if you didn’t want to do that, why were you trying to join the group?  Again just go make your own or join a non-speed running group.
---
Why did you want to clear every mob in dungeons/fractals every run? Maybe if it’s your first time around, okay. But after that, what do you gain? People value their time and it makes zero sense to spend 1 hour + in a dungeon that can be done in 5 minutes. 
---
Also with chrono/mirage came dps builds, didn’t only have to tank. So... once again, what?
---
As far as hating arc dps? It’s just a tool, the same people that would kick you for low dps are the same people that would kick you for being dead weight in a group. The vast majority use it to monitor their dps/allow them to check how they are doing and work on improving. It’s a tool that gives more insight into how well you are performing.
---
For something like Raids, that’s a great thing because there are mechanic and dps checks, so no you can’t really just run or do whatever you want. It’s not because the players are tools, it’s just how Anet designed the encounters. If everyone did 3k dps the boss wouldn’t die and you would wipe to certain auto-fail mechanics.
---
Next, how have you ignored templates that were approved and greenlit by the security lead? You could have had unlimited builds for over 2 years. 
---
Do you pvp/wvw/pve? If you do 3 of your slots are already taken. You mentioned you play fractals and other content. You do realize that unless you are willing to pay for the templates you don’t actually gain anything? And then all you get is 3 max. How is this better than the unlimited you had access to before that was free? Why couldn’t you try your builds back then???
---
I just can’t fathom this, this post has to be a troll. Otherwise this reminds me of a person that sits on the bed of the truck pretending to do something while everyone else is actually pushing the truck out of the ditch. But then at the end they go, “yea we did it, see my way is fine”... well yea everyone else picked up for your slack.

I already use [d9vk](https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/d9vk), I doubt d912pxy would bring any more FPS. Thank you for the tip though, that project seems awesome!
---
This pretty much goes for any game. I recently quit / "took a break" from the other mmo and games I was playing to play GW2 and am having an amazing time. I think people expect way too much out of their "main" game if they've been playing it for years.
---
I find it wirred, u using totally a bug to get in the Keep. Hopefully Anet get it fixed somehow while to changed the complett Maps would be deffentliy to much.
---
This. So much this. Why are there so many tonics?
---
The bigger things for me as chrono player is that you get hit with the nerf bat again and again and again, while other specs dont get that treatment. eg mirage is in every gamemode far to strong. it has to much utility and dmg, i just dont understand why they gave the chrono the trait off but the mirage has still the good old panic f4 shatter...
---
&gt; I'm not lagging […] it's on your end dude.
---
How on earth did you draw _that_ conclusion? Do you work for ArenaNet and did you investigate my issue?
---
Or do you simply not know how computers work? For all I know that could be a bug which only appears when your character name starts with an A and is exactly 10 characters long.
---
True true
---
When I explore now, I tend to shift into first person. When your camera is looking at the ground all the time, you can really miss out on the scale of the world and the incredible landscapes Anet creates. There’s plenty to criticize about the game, but the world design is just [chef kiss]
---
Like looking UP at the Durmand Priory from over the bridge or down by the river is breathtaking. Totally caught me by surprise the first time.
---
For the first time, I just experienced a desynched instance. I've completed the Clocktower about 30 times this year, so I know the timing well - jump when the lightning strikes the clockface. Today, I just hit the shattered clockface and fell, super confused.
---
On my very next attempt, I noticed all the platforms that are usually animated as they are assembled, instead just "poofed" into existence fully formed with no animation, and all the other players seemed to be jumping onto thin air before they would appear.
---
So at the clockface, I changed the timing to be about 1 second sooner - jumping the second the edge of the clockface first became visible, long before the lightning strikes - and succeeded the next 4 attempts in that instance with that revised timing.
---
It's not "convenience" if your game is made by design to be inconvenient as hell, without convenience purchases. It's just aggressive monetization.
---
\*Looks at his 2 year birthday blaster\*
---
Oh you poor thiiiiiing
---
Oh I love this! Which armor pieces is it?
---
Oh I'm sorry, I thought you were genuinely asking me why I felt like Anet wasn't including me.  I didn't realize you just wanted to tell me I'm wrong.
---
Didnt they announce that you could still use arcdps builds after the patch? Then why are people still complaining?
---
