By all Six Gods, what is that thing? It's huge!
---
---
---
Yeah i guess so, there's a lot of potential fixes for it though, since some people are against the countdown timer on kick idea.... Why can't anet do something much simpler like give the rewards in a mini clickable chest above your mini map?
---

---
The combination of the chest / instant-kick overall feels pretty bad.
---
I go out of my way to do Fractals at every tier to maintain a balanced perspective; I play all sorts of support &amp; DPS classes.  
---
&gt; If you were legitimately a fractal god then you would know that even though burning is one of the burstier conditions, it still does not come anywhere close to a proper burst rotation from a power dps class in fractals.
---
This is true *when* people can play classes like DH, Weaver, Holosmith or Soulbeast correctly.  **Unfortunately, many, even at the T4 level cannot.**  In fact, your inability to push 18-20, 23k? on cFirebrand should speak volumes about global inability to grasp skill priority and rotations.  Perhaps, look in the mirror? Your struggles with Firebrand reflect bottlenecks in the skill distribution of the game.  It's not uncommon, nor is it worth getting defensive about and calling someone...?
---
Oh right.  
---
&gt; I'm a cunt, and an arrogant unlikable shithead because I raid and do CM Fractals.  
---
... because, what? because I'm telling you things that you're not ready to hear? Because you aren't willing to relate or think for yourself?  It's not that people that underperform are bad players.  They're just unpracticed and haven't figured out how to abuse their traits, skills and boons to deal competent damage **or are not willing to.**  It's GW2 in a nutshell, really. I don't consider myself an amazing player, but most people really have no idea where their DPS comes from, and you're a prime example, whether you like it or not. 
---
Usually I never see whoever takes me out until it's too late.  And changing skills fast on the fly....not sure how I can do that when they are charging at me.  Hopefully it's just due to my inexperience

That's an Arachnid, not a bug...
---
I agree with you but then there should be a cooldown or the ability to block kicked players from rejoining the squad. I learned only recently that some people take it very personal when the commander denies them the raid spot for whatever reason. I was very surprised when I saw my first lfg troll that made it his personal mission to keep a 9/10 group off the system because com wouldnt let him join the xx.kp raid without any. Wasnt even the last time I saw this...
---
Getting arcdps will help your overall damage.
---
However, as a necro, arcdps can engrain bad habits due to people wanting to be "big dick top dps" and top the charts. This leads to them doing dumb things like dumping their shades, wells, and breach all at the same time, which is generally bad gameplay. 
---
It's definitely good to know where you're at in regards to overall damage, but it isn't everything, especially as a necro.
---
It is a good idea to keep an eye on your strips, though. Necros do great damage, but their real strength is in their boon strips. If you can find yourself doing good dps, (while still following the commander's calls), AND are stripping a ton of boons, it's usually safe to say that you're doing things properly.
---
It always baffles me how hard it is to find a good awailable Sylvari name. Like who the hell looks up the latin names of interesting/beautiful plants and alters them slightly to make them sound more like a person, except for me? 
---
I've had something similar happen in the past couple of days. When made invisible by an event/story mission while mounted. The character is standing unanimated on the mount. I can't interact with anything or dismount.
---
Okay background to this:
---
We were doing a daily T4 session with this pug group, everything was fine until the very last fight
---
Asuran 1 wanted to play spread, while asuran 4 wanted to stack, this caused such conundrum, that Asuran 4 wanted to kick Asuran 1,  then Asuran 2 was too high to even play and Asuran 4 just wanted to chill this made Asuran 2 to kick 3... i just joined the kicking party &lt;3
---
Thaumanova is my favorite Fractal, but it's pretty divisive amongst shitty pugs.  Subject 6 is a disaster zone and the anomaly itself varies wildly depending on how panicked people get w/ laser on them.  Most CM groups can stack and hex-panel stagger, but non-CM groups are a train wreck. I solo'd the anomaly from 10-0% yesterday on Druid.  I wish I had put better music on.. 
---
Shouldn't Aurene be immortal after eating Joko?
---
I hate when someone starts a votekick, because one guy takes a bit longer to join or whatever, and then never stop that friggin vote for the whole run.
---
Thanks, that stuff is super interesting
---
Your smiley have a very big nose (C:
---
Once seem never unseen
---
Heck we took an hour to finish this meess! An HOUUUR
---
Hakf of the group got tired including asuran 1 and then some left! We picked new asurans and finished it! On the first try!
---
Asuran DO hate other asurans! All the time! Just go to rata Sum! You’ll hear the idle chat there~
---
&gt;  its not their FAULT that you cant loot. 
---
Yes it is... Since the chest was literally right in front of me, but i got kicked 3 seconds after the boss kill, denying me the chance to click on the chest.
---
&gt; it ISNT lfg abuse, 
---
It definitely is. I looked it up on anets reporting policies just to be sure.
---
&gt; like rly ppl,use your brain before you post, 
---
The irony
---
&gt; and dont be shocked when PUG/RANDOMS gona RANDOMLY kick you. 
---
Of course i'll be shocked when people abuse a system.
---
&gt; can you ONE MORE TIME EXPLAIN ME,WHAT YOU WANA REPORT THOSE PPL FOR? 
---
For abusing the lfg &amp; denying a player the loot from a boss, after he helped them kill it... It's kinda common sense
---
&gt; think about it rly hard, 
---
The irony x2
---
&gt; ,that you cant do shit and they didnt do shit. 
---
Well, they definitely did perform a reportable offense.

&gt;  rly butthurt ppl,crying on reedit for 5165816816846 time

Irony x3

it's not a new issue, and i feel that getting the main loot from bouncy chests is something that should have been years ago. nobody cares for the fact that technically you have to interact with a statue to get your loot (seriously, where is the logic in that?!).
---
this isn't a new issue, and auto loot isn't a sufficient answer to the issue either, as there still are bosses where it doesn't trigger.
---
alas you're pleading to the same company that promised a squad merge fix - though that could be easily achieved by disabling the entire functionality, as it has seen barely any legitimate use anyway - with the relase of PoF.
---
You're not wrong about most of what you're saying, other than that all of that is intentional. This is not a game for grinding out more power and better gear to godmode though everything. If you're looking for that, you want another game. GW will never scratch that itch. 
---
You beat the lfg boss, the hardest in the game!
---
Wrong way to Bearbow. No extra skills, no elite, no heal, no sigil, no runes, don't even dodge. Just bear, and just bow. 
---
Just bow and bear. Rawr. 
---
having a dps meter will help you but maybe not in the way you want, at least not directly
---
you can see which of your abilities are the highest percentage of your dps..but this could also mean you use them more often for whatever reason
---
you can however compare yourself to other scourges in your squad, see which of their skills are the highest impact, notice patterns, adjust your own gameplay based on that etc.
---
arcdps also keeps metrics of boons corrupted and your own boons..so you can notice that maybe you didn't get the proper buffs to really shine, like you were only at 10 might stacks while the other scourges were capped at 25
---
maybe it was your supports' fault but maybe you didn't position properly to get them etc.
---
so yea **tl;dr** it definitely helps but don't expect a miracle solution
---
also, as far as i know only arcDps is officially allowed by anet so steer clear of the other ones
---
It's not the inteded path, but it's the one everyone takes.
---
Yep its pretty sad they have yet to finish this class before hot and its still crap.
---
Glowing at night salads ftw.

We love all :p

The character creator was honestly the first time Guild Wars 2 Wowed me. Like he mentions, the sketchy painted style was an instant hit, and the diversity of the races knocked my socks off.
---
Yet you still can wipe 1500 range around you with 1hits in a low level zone.
---
Instead of getting mad at me or calling me stupid, please explain why I’m wrong. I want to be convinced that my reasons are not defects.
---
The in game soundtrack. It would feel like slapping Jeremy Soule in the face not to.
---
this is what I've been learning too, slow down and actually let people get better/loot because knowing the rotations like the back of your hand is nice but let's be honest it ain't hard for us who have playing a while.
---
ps for op yes fashion because duh my  immersion 
---
I touched on It, but I'll put it clearly and decisively:
---
The game was designed to have little to no end game progression grind.
---
It isn't a lack or a defect: It was a purposeful decision and a major selling point.
---
This game was made for people who do not want mandatory grind in their MMOs. Full stop. Cosmetic Grind is there for people that like to make goals without interfering with the purpose of Guild Wars 2. If you like end game progression grind, then that's a valid opinion... for a different game.
---
Saying it should be in this game is like saying Mario should be a first person shooter. There's nothing *wrong* with FPS games, but it's a *different game.*
---
For sure! But make sure you use the stability and weakness wells. No one needs quickness and alacrity, right?
---
Nah, but you're not too far off. Chronomancers, at least in raids, take the quickness and alacrity wells and of course Signet of Inspiration, and then try to get 3 clones before Continuum Shifting, putting down both wells and sometimes Tides of Time, then activating the Signet before they Shift back and repeat (drop the wells again, ToT, SoI). The hard part is figuring out the order and timing in order to get the boons applied in time to SoI them, especially since the wells only apply boons on the third pulse and Tides of Time gives quickness going out and alacrity coming back. Sometimes you might need to cast some of those skills before you are ready to Shift. Don't worry too much, though. It's pretty forgiving, and if you don't get everything done in 6 seconds, you Shift back and do it all again anyway, this time with boons already applied.
---
The asura who are little furry..... oh great another video of a guy that has no clue of what hes talking about.
---
That's clearly a typo, violators will be *found*...and *dealt with.*
---
A sensible chuckle, I'd say.
---
That’s pretty much all that most end game MMOs do. Once ya got best stats, it’s all about the cosmetics.
---
Only thing is, other MMOs give you more item level to work towards after awhile. GW2 asks you to get better at your class.
---
Painfully unfunny

Wow has a minute long timer on instance boot (in case of organized raids/dungeons, doesn't apply to queueable content). That comes with the downside of people removed from the group being able to pull the boss to wipe the raid (you'd think this would be rare but it happens quite often). It can get really bad in case of a pug with long loading screens.
---
That being said, loot (be it gear or gold) from bosses gets mailed to you with the exception of quest items and reagents. I think that's a really good system and it would solve OPs issue without introducing the woes of wow ninjapullers.
---
&gt;2 they dont have april fools team anymore, and rest of the teams dont have enough people to do anything other then what they suppose to do already.
---
They do have a festival team....
---
You know whats more cancerous? You can kick people mid game if boss is low and you think you can kill comfortably. Just kick players who you dont like, they wont get shit because boss isnt dead yet. Im glad this isnt a thing in gw2 community but it can happen the system allows it.
---
The new skill is called War Kitty of Doom, a taunt move that will trap the enemy Warclaw by utterly confusing the living daylights out of them just long enough to get them de-mounted.  Using this skill will also de-mount the player because kitty is high maintenance and has too much sass to stick around. Recharge is until whenever kitty feels like werking again. 
---
This explanation is very simple and clear. And yeah, mathematically it is true. But as a programmer I can't say that 0.999... equals 1, in programm code they can not be equal. And not just because 1 is integer and 0.999... is a float, even if you compare 1.000... and 0.999... they still can not be equal.
---
The difference between the damage of a beginner and an experienced veteran can vary by about 5-6 times.  One experienced, practiced player can be worth as many as 5-6 beginners.  It's not something you'll notice without ArcDPS, and no one tells you about in the spirit of benevolence.  Builds in GW2 aren't equal in the context of endgame fractals or raiding.  They're more balanced than they used to be, but they aren't created equally and they don't carry equal weight if they're played at the skill floor, skill plateau or skill ceiling. 
---
Tequatl.
---
i'm usually able to fix this by getting out of combat and then hitting the keybind for that specific mount a few times
---
Congrats!
---
But drowning game mechanics in sand is fun!
---
Why they didn't start with Season 2?
---
I don't know what they keep giving off the supposed money making content... Obviously, the story isn't gonna be the one bringing in the sales.. not ever. It's the one content that makes this game not an MMO. Need to either increase the difficulty bar way up to rely on other players or don't make it. I like their intention of going for a polished masterpiece but it's such a waste how not each instance is a mini dungeon. Some episodes are rehash lazy modo.
---
A very good example of recent episode All or Nothing. Put a max player cap if 5 player is too strong. Blowing tanks with oil, put more branded dredges raids on the tanks to distract you from making an oil path where two players need to clear the path for one to pour oil. They can do this in waves or stake out 2 min per tank. Last standoff wtih Krailk, like inrease breakbar or get punished for not breaking (more brandstorm spawn), each tower can be harder to charge. Cinematics and script are spot on but missed opportunity once again..
---
I bought the package one, 3 for 2400 gems. Then i put glyph of industry on them, so much time save gathering!
---
Super cool, thanks for making this!
---
Ya, so if you click on combat replay in the top right and select the details window you can see might stacks during the fight on each player and where exactly they are. There are a large number of people getting teleported so only a few are stacked together. You'll naturally have people need to spread out at parts for agony and green circles but with all the movement and bad positioning you weren't going to get good output. Normally for training runs like this that are just learning I'd recommend a kiter (farthest person gets aggro) so that people can just start off learning the teleports, special action skill, and green circles without having to worry about being hit or too far. Also you did have 3 supports, 2 chronos, a DH on longbow, a warrior on greatsword/rifle, other druid camping staff, a condi soulbeast with greatsword so the fight is going to take muuuuch longer than it should since no one was doing damage. Are you running these with a guild or a training discord? If you are running with a trainer I'd suggest you have them help the others with [gear](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) and [builds](https://snowcrows.com/raids/) first. If you wanted to take a look at other training options snowcrows has [a page for that](https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/).
---
Do you just log on an account or have to activate via hero panel or gemstore? I know my main account has all unlocked but for my alts.
---
Thank you for the writeup of your process, I always enjoy reading these things
---
That's actually worth but the raids are harder in terms of flaunting rights.
---
You see, there's your problem.. You need some strong Charrs, not tiny noodle arm-ed imps ;)
---
There was farting noises when you sat down on chairs. So there was that.
---
I hear you on that one!! The in-game soundtrack is amazing! It's been about 4 years playing and I only recently taken to having the sound off or my own compilations of music.
---
There should be a timeout counter after you get kicked. IE: You have 30 seconds to leave the instance or you will be removed.
---
&gt;rot
---
It might just be you and/or your build. You didn’t provide enough details for us to assess your specific situation. Regardless, I have not had the same experiences that you detail here.
---
A full exotic or ascended geared character with all traits unlocked will be at a distinct advantage in low level areas, even with scaling applied. On my daredevil, for example, I can one shot most things. These things that take 5-8 hits with a low level and low geared character become much easier in better gear. Same goes for my reaper which can solo just about anything in the low level world with ease. Packs of 10 npcs? No problem. 
---
At a low level though, these feats are not attainable. You’re right about the legendary gear though. Ascended gear is the end game and legendary gear is purely for cosmetic reasons (and for the free stat changes) This game isn’t about developing a large power curve (unlike WoW, where you stay on an eternal gear treadmill). Rather, this game is about trying out different specializations and classes. You can get the “best gear” in the game by simply playing the game, or if you’re in a rush, farming places like the silver wastes (materials to craft ascended items), bitterfrost frontier, or dragons stand. 
---
One challenge that I like to use to test my own ability to play the game and my class skills is soloing a champion npc. Some builds will not be able to do this. Others can. And, depending on how you gear (eg which runes and sigils you pick) can make all the difference in the world for certain encounters.
---
Maybe try out a different class if your character feels weak!
---
Cheers
---
The only title I'll ever wear if I get it is "Plays For Keeps".
---
The only reason why raids are harder IMO is finding more competent people. Finding 4 competent people is easier than finding 9 competent people T\_T
---
Should have a system to pick up left behind loot from raids outside the raid once it's been checked clear tbh. Other games have done this. 
---
yeah happened to me on raptor
---
10/10
---
I actually just joined the Guild Wars 2 Raid Academy Discord server a few days ago, so I've only been able to do one run with them so far. The rest are with a raid training guild that I found through /r/GuildRecruitment. Before we start, the trainer says that we should have a raid-ready build. They treat everybody like adults and assume that everybody who joins indeed does so, as opposed to discussing each person's build in detail with them. But after considering the builds that you mentioned, perhaps I should do as you mention and bring this up with the trainer since people are using questionable builds.
---
So we've established that the comp was a limiting factor for me, but did anything stand out to you about what I personally might have been doing incorrectly or could have been doing better? I know that I need some slight work on the mechanics/positioning, which will come with practice, but as far as my rotation and such, I'm not sure what I should work on (if anything).
---
Got it two weeks ago, didn't brag about it.
---
Anyway, got it during a casual cm run Where this wasn't planned. 
---
Just don't go the Bitterfrost route where *everything* chills you... 
---
I suspect it's not affecting all players.  I was hit by my first DC during an sPvP match and appeared to be the only player in the match affected (always fun DCing during an easy win and seeing that dishonor /s).  Are you West Coast?  Do you have XFinity?  Wouldn't be the first time West Coast XFinity players got hit with login server issues.
---
Asuran Reaper: I can feel your anger. It makes you stronger, gives you focus.
---
Same thing happening to me as well.. 
---
General Kenobi!
---
Is Silent Scope on deadeye overrated? I'm running a pve build with it, mainly building on Mark and getting buffs from it so both of the other traits are really seducing.
---
I wanted to say the same thing as well.
---
&gt; the idea of grinding for cosmetics is getting to me
---
Then you must hate almost every game on the market bar a few. Cosmetics is the current landscape for so many games. In WoW you grind for gear because every so often they increase how tough mobs are and then you repeat the process. GW2 has removed that process and replaced it with cosmetics. Either way you're grinding.
---
I prefer physical chests... more immersion.  
---
What would be cool is for kicking to not force you out of the map. Maybe just mute and disable you from future credit? Something like that.
---
? Isn't this normal?
---
If they'd said "repeating of course" then it would be, but without that I doubt it was a reference. 
---
i need an ascended harrier's backpiece and was wondering which is easier to get? ascended banner of the dauntless commander or the IG-g417 is easier/faster to get
---
which one would give me an exotic version fastest?
---
[This is a real bearbow min-maxed](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vNMQJATDFVsw+VgBLg/NGyDqPES3MYDgCYt5DugPhUSl1VdF-j1RBQBmRJIe0FcFlfA4JAchLBgA3fgSq/QKgIGDA-w)
---
Heal doesn't matter, you're not going to be using it anyway, you're taking signets though because they're for your pet. Mentioned it below about Spotter so I'm not going to touch on that. Naturally double longbows with a Vision Sigil and Quick Draw trait so your Point Blank Shot comes off cooldown faster for big DPS boosts from the 100% crit knockbacks. Naturally core ranger because its meta for Bearbow. Full Zerk but with Druid runes because in a certain light Druid runes' icon looks like a bear so that's instantly meta. You also need to be a fat, hairy norn as well since you get the elite skill Become the Bear, and becoming a bear itself means becoming the very meta itself and some circles consider a large hairy man as a bear as well.

I can not seem to get in Xfinity Denver CO
---
With continuum split I have almost no time to use a skill if I had no clones and I have a bit more time to spam skills when I had 3 clones. Is that how it works?
---
I was kicked out a few hours ago in the midst of doing the bounty. 😒 Couldn't log in as I kept having error messages. 
---
Well, in Fractals you can forego the oil for sharpening stones as Fractal Potions would help your boon duration (in fact a lot of boon chronos take a bit more DPS gear than boon gear because of that, as they run the risk of overcapping boon duration with the gear they use for Raids) though only if you have the mastery leveled up to boost the effects of the Fractal Potions.
---
Dont know about you now, but I just got kicked out again. Lakewood/Tacoma area.
---
That's kind of great news ! 
---
Listent to your teaser, it made me think about the whole idea behind OCRemix community, but dedicated to SAB. Now Master Dusk is yours too, it really OCRemix. 
---
Can't wait guys !!!
---
I'm sure u know shat it is ;D
---
I believe so, as buffs like Banners or Spotter add raw numbers to your stats like Power or Precision and not like boons such as Fury where it adds a percentage to critical chance. Would want someone to verify this though (the only similar circumstance I can point out is when you're at 100% crit chance, since you won't go over that 100% but still can stack numbers on precision and convert them via utility items like sharpening stones into other stats. IIRC this is what people try to do when min-maxing in end game group content by having Fury take the brunt of crit chance and let precision round up while converting the excess).
---
Ah thanks i will check more details about this! :)
---
Reporting from Bellevue, Xfinity has been a bitch here today. I think I saw they were doing maintenance in our area and to expect loss of connection
---
Mesmer is okay in zergs, but you don't need many. Definitely not one per party, whereas you want 1 fb and 1 scrapper these days for support slots. 
---
Usually the single mesmer slot in a squad will be filled by the commander or the dedicated mesmer in the guild group, and you definitely won't need any pug mesmers who aren't in comms. 
---
For pug zergs and what not if you know how to press buttons you're already an asset to the team, so comp doesn't matter moreso than having a brain.
---
Hey, thank you so much for doing this and for announcing it.   It was really satisfying to finally complete that. I'll definitely be looking for more Eccentric events to join! 
---
I mean, you could click the link to see.
---
Simple solution: kicking party members right after a bossfight should be disabled for a period of max 5 mins or something until everyone in the party has looted the reward.
---
That way you can still kick the person afterward if you're not satisfied with his/her performance yet they don't lose out on their loot.
---
depends on the a**mount**
---
DEPENDS ON THE MOUNT
---
Even easier, just auto-loot raid chests by default for everybody.
---
No

Oh this is already our 23rd project :p
---
And yeah OCR are like an inspiration to us :)
---
Not just your opinion, that's a known and agreed fact.
---
It does not save the issue but usually if you rejoin the same instance your chest is still lootable. So worth a try messaging if you can  come back only to loot the chest. But yeah really douchemove to not wait.
---
"Feline tames can no longer be used as ranger pets, as nobody can actually control a cat."
---
As for legendaries used for cosmetics, when you start to push more into the endgame (fractals, raids, WvW), you'll find hot stat swapping very handy (and even better with a build templates add-on).
---
But you don't unlock reaper while leveling necro ???
---
Don't judge.
---
Get auto loot, then you wont have to whine about it....Still no idea how some are too lazy to get it....being so easy to get.
---
Catastrophe 
---
Firebrand makes good use of Shield in WvW zerg. You can use Shield as Spellbreaker in WvW zerg but those are in some more niche cases for GvG or outnumbered fights.
---
Any flavor of power Warrior will usually use a shield in WvW roaming/small scale.
---
Then you have a niche use in raid for a Herald handkitter on Deimos.
---
Yep! You get 1.5 seconds for no clones shattered and an extra 1.5 per clone shattered, for a max of 6 seconds before Shifting back, although you can manually Shift back earlier.
---
Has the promo for path of fire ended? Can't enter the discount code. It says it is not valid.

You will also notice that the next time you play, your player model has some fancy clothes and a tiara.

That's what she said! &lt;_&lt;

It's something that was implemented a long time ago before they switched a lot of the rewards/unlocks/etc to account-bound instead of character-bound.
---
If you regularly do dungeons with a few friends one useful thing I did was to do a story run every once in while with them on character that needed them so that you are less and less burdened by this.

Hey there, thanks for the tip, I've added the deadline-date to the rules
---
Hey, good question, I've added an according rule to the rules section
---
Sweet, I've finally won the Fashion Wars!
---
Sadly they won't. ANet haven't touched dungeons in years, unless to fix critical bugs, and they probably won't ever again.
---
Get unlimited tools yes, Breakeven after 4-5 years gathering everything you see. Enjoy
---
&gt; tiara
---
what about butcapes?
---
Solution: make players unable to kick others in an instance while in combat; after boss kill, revive killed and downed on instant, but keep them in combat for a minute.
---
&gt; A good fix for this, would be to not lock the loot for the week~~, until the chest itself is looted.~~
---
FIFY
---
Support firebrand? What kinda stats are good for it in the zerg? Good ol' Minstrel?
---
Paysafe cards if you have them in your country, in my country you go to the shops and buy "internet money" for cash, you get a receipt that has a code. But check for safety also that na shop supports it. Otherwise paypal.

Go for elementalist, top ranged damage with staff and not simple like a warrior.

One day, my son, everything what touches the light will be yours.
---
Any operating system I know allows you to switch keyboard layouts on the fly. I'd love to have configurable controls, of course, but with limited time to spend I had to prioritize.
---
They already made it impossible for someone to get kicked in the middle of a fight. So if you had autoloot it wouldn't happen to you, it's nobody's fault but your own that you didn't get your stuff. 
---
I dunno, the queen looks really weird.
---
They already did, they added auto loot which gives you the loot as long as you are inside the instance when the boss dies, regardless of whether you are dead or alive. 
---
OP is just too lazy to grab it.

If we are talking about end game PvE (Fractals and Raids) what you will also lack as "ranged" is all the boons and buffs that are supposed to be provided to you if you stay on the main group. So if you stay far away you will miss on all that and your damage output will suffer quite a bit.
---
If we are talking about random open world PvE then mostly anything will work, but for endgame even "ranged" weapons will be played in mostly melee range because of the boons and heal/general support even if they have some nice cleave (because staff on any Elementalist build has a lot of cleave).
---
now go for stealth bombers
---
Actually, I've been playing the game long enough to remember when there were content updates every two weeks ;-) I can see their strategy, I'm just deeply dissatisfied with it.
---
If you cannot trust your VPN provider you shouldn't use it at all.
---
Throw back
---
You need to run either power or condition damage in open-world pve-- especially power. If you do, you will destroy most things in a couple hits.
---
I forgot to switch out of my minstrel's set when I was running around in the open world and couldn't believe how slow killing stuff was. Grab an exotic full power or CD (preferably power) set of armor and accessories just for the open world. If you're still struggling to kill things quickly at that point, then it's literally an issue with your gameplay. 
---
You can facetank as a mesmer in  open world pve too, just pop your f1 skills and use sword 2 and dodge every now and then. Even then, I rarely dodge, because in power gear you kill stuff so fast in the open world. Sure, you take a few hits, and then your enemy is dead.
---
Range is not an option for instanced group play.
---
Me and my friend are wanting to get into raiding. We’ve done a lot of fractals, both have full ascended. What class is easy to start raiding on as a dps? I have a full set of ascended on each armor class, so it’s just knowing which would be the best option to go. I mainly use condi bannerslave in fractals. Nether of us want to tank, thats for sure haha.
---
&gt; Git Gud or ~~die~~ dye trying!
---
Excuse you, we are talking about fashion wars!
---
/bow Forgive me master!
---
That was useful in the past because we had no other way to get ascended jewelry but now it is actaully only good for the crafting bags, because the jewelry you can get from laurels are just the core game stats and you can farm them on season maps instead which also include all other stats. 
---
And the tier 6 material you can farm gold to buy if you lack of that, whilst clovers can not be bought by gold straight of the trading post. So it is all about planning ahead. What do you need and how much clovers do you have now. If you have tons of clovers and can make the legendary you want then go with the laurels or the ascended material depending on if you need more tier 6 materials or more gold.
---
Well here's something crazy: You can also do content to have fun instead of doing it just in order to get somewhat decent! 
---
In games like WoW, you better do alot ofcontent in order to get somewhat decent gear.
---
And that's not all, you mostly will not even like the content since you'll do it 100x times over and over again because if you don't, you won't ever be somewhere near decent because ilvl is everything!
---
And that's not the best part yet, no there's more! You thought you could play a class or spec you'd enjoy? Boy are you wrong!
---
You should only play what others tell you to play, and if you do better be sure you have a good ilvl and do the exact stuff how others tell you you should!
---
Having fun yet?
---
But yeah, Gw2 is a weird game in that regard..,In here you're playing something to just have fun instead of grind..Crazy shit right?
---
In open world/solo play, do whatever works best for you. Really doesnt matter what you do tbh.
---
Fractals and raids, better dont bring that shit. If you stand at range youre a liability. Heals and boons are all in melee range stacked on top of each other which means you wont have boons and you will deal almost no damage. Besides this the healer needs to focus on the stack and you as well making his life hell. You will get kicked for this in no time
---
&gt;  I mainly use condi bannerslave in fractals.
---
Great option for raids. The build should just be slightly different, if not the same
---
That was my guess but then i thought that in our homeinstances it wont really matter how they look. I also guess that is why we never get the SAB mounts either which makes me sad.
---
I am a total hypocrite when it comes to that though, because i would hate if the game got clutttered with dumb mount skins, but i would throw all my money on SAB mount skins without even giving it a single thought :D
---
Uh?  
---
I went there, it asks me for 200 gems, it's not free.  
---
What am I missing, here?
---
Where did you find this, my dude?
---
for more open-world PvE and to address some solo-stuff, I would go with [Longbow BeastMastery](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Ranger_-_Longbow_Beastmastery), I believe this has the desired range you would like as much as being able to solo-content as well, on top of it, grants you the choice of changing weapon play-style when you \*\*REALLY\*\* need to. Staff tempest/weaver is 'alright', definitely fun with the rotation of elements at your disposal however, yes it is weak atm and you're also stuck in using staff. Condi Scourge is also pretty fun to, plenty of conditions you can roll your enemies in, can swap between max range staff and mid-range scepter, however since this is a condi-based build, don't expect to beat-down foes extremely fast, the one main difference between Condi Scourge and ranger however, is the amount of cleave / AoE you have accessible on Condi Scourge. You might like railing down foes in mass amounts of wells, shades, marks. Personally, i'd vote for ranger among the pool of ranged classes for open-world / solo-content. \*\*NOT TO MENTION\*\* but ranger also has that amazing down-state 3 skill for self-reviving, which is pretty fantastic to have in solo-content 
---
It shows 200 gems, to me, not 0.
---
It is in pvp and wvw.
---
http://imgur.com/a/j1fPujM
---
i mean you already listed pretty much all the options, some are a bit wrong though
---
in terms of meta/close to meta pve builds:
---
elementalist - tempest both as support and dps with scepter/warhorn, staff can be played even if not ideal for both tempest and weaver
---
ranger - druid axe+staff(bow is a very niche pick sometimes), condition soulbeast double shortbow
---
necro - condition scourge scepter/torch(staff sucks for pve)
---
thief - rifle deadeye, you're stuck in place a lot so while strong on paper it doesn't work so well in realistic scenarios
---
doing solo stuff on heal/support is not recommended and the time-to-kill is insanely long
---
raid bosses in this game take roughly 5-10min each and there are around 3 per wing(sometimes 4)
---
even if you play range though, you will be expected to be in melee(this applies to other instanced content such as fractals and dungeons too)
---
I guess you did not do your research before you started this game. We have down scaling which means that you as lvl 80 are not gonna be able to run to the low level areas and one shot a boss just to destroy the fun for the players in that area who is leveling. I see zero issue with and should be a thing in all mmos.
---
We have bis endgame gear, ascended have the highest stats and can not be bought off the trading post. You have to work for that either by crafting it or getting it inside of the game mode you want to play in. Like for example, Fractals, PvE raids, WvW, PvE and there is also a slim chance that you get them as drops anywere from mobs or players dropping them when dying. But again that is a low chance. 
---
There are also ascended weapon collections to make. And if you want to be able to stat swap when ever out of combat then you need legendary gear. Have the same stats as ascended but you can swap stats very easy. 
---
We also use a lot of alts so many of us gear those up too. 
---
Thing is this game is very skilled based. So you will never get gear that will make you the best and then are able to gank other players or mobs just by looking at them. You will only be able to do that if you are good enough. And some how in my mind i think this would be something you would want to go for rather then a few more stats on your gear and more hp on the bosses for every new raid? I don't know but in my world that beats any gear tread mill. 
---
I think I should rephrase myself.
---
With a ranged class I mean the option to be ranged, but I have no problem sticking in boon range.
---
Isn't being boon range still some distance away from actually being melee, more like mid range (in order to receive them)?
---
All I don't want to is to get close and personal with the 'boss' mobs.
---
If I can't stay at max range then it's okay just as long as I can have some kind of distance between me and the mob.
---
With that said, isn't there really any class (dps or healer) that can use staff, bow, scepter or whatever in a way that's considered viable by most? 
---
To play Devil's advocate, it's not surprising people aren't sharing the links on this subforum when they're largely abandoned. To list a few examples:
---
The sub's 'latest patch notes' links to September 2018.
---
The 'upcoming changes' links to an article about changes that went live some time ago.
---
There are other links to discount offers that ended over 4 months ago.
---
Makes me wonder why we had to throw away stuff we already had before
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Unclaimed_Items
---
So scepter scourge, Staff and axe druid and staff tempest or weaver can be viable when staying like close to the group but still have the ability to do their thing just a little farder away than let's say sword chrono?
---
The only thing that really matters is just being able to use those weapons in a viable way. I don't care if I have to stay close to the group as long as I'm not standing right before the boss like sword chrono or warrior then I think I'll be able to stomach it.
---
I really just despise the fantasy of using a sword, dagger etc and only love the fantasy of using staves and scepter to. Some degree..
---
Using a bow and throwing axes is the farthest I will go from being a caster role if I really have to.
---
I wish I could like it but I just can't sadly. :/
---
You have to
---
You cannot kick while in combat. 
---
Reddit seriously isn't the forum for suggesting ideas ... or any serious discussion. Try the official forums.
---
You're out of luck then, I'm afraid. So long as buff sharing has a limited range, and there's no sign that will ever change, you'll have to stay in range of your allies to pull your weight in instanced group content.
---
I'd advise either sticking to open world and doing whatever flavourful build takes your fancy, starting your own groups on LFG clearly labelled as 'non-meta' to avoid conflict, or biting the bullet and playing builds in their most effective manner to avoid being carried.
---
I need to find raiding guild ASAP so I won’t get kicked for learning mechanics and how to properly manage my rotation on current encounter. 
---
Every time I read something about pugs I became more and more upset that only thing left is looking for WipeTrainingGroups :x I’d rather stick with a static squad tbh.

---
Ok thank you.
---
But really what is it with people these days? Why can't they just play what they enjoy instead of doing stuff fast.
---
As long as you're having a good time who cares if it takes a littlebit longer?
---
As long as you clear it and group survives that's all that matters to me.
---
It's just a game, not a job where you have to be either efficient or get fired.. 
---
Fractales / SW are the most efficient for that.
---
Or you can also simply explore the map and it'll be available before you notice.

There is so much to say about this post but where did you get that you loose one DPS slot with a Renegade?
---
\- Old school comp: 2 chronos, 2 druids (or 1 druid + 1 healer), 1 warrior, 5 DPS
---
\- new comp: 2 firebrands, 1 renegade, 1 druid, 1 warrior, 5 DPS
---
\- mix comp: 1 firebrand, 1 renegade, 1 chrono, 1 druid, 1 warrior, 5 DPS
---
Not to mention that a quickness firebrand does far more DPS than a chrono.
---
I'm just here to sell tin foil hats

Likely because they've done this content a thousand times and are doi g it for rewards instead of for fun. That's okay too.

---
I don't agree with OP but losing a DPS slot technically does happen with taking a Ren if you don't run 2 healers in the old school comp.
---
It's just super toxic imo...
---
First the commander has just no manners whatsoever!
---
Second, if the run is going smoothly, just don't kick people even if their dps is not top notch! 
---
This game doesn't require max dps at all! Most important thing is the mechanics and be able to dodge while doing an ok dps...
---
I kicked when there are some wipes and I see a really atrocious dps which could clearly be the problem.
---
Some people are just ass in raids (and fract too...)  
---
It is not a selling group, only a lone wolf scammer taking advantage of pugs, being blacklisted by him shouldn't be the biggest issue you'd facing
---
Some are easier than others for sure, but if you play T4 fracs regularly there's something to be said for playing what you're comfortable on. If you want some easy rotations, I'd look at Daredevil for a power class and Soulbeast for a condi class. Have a look at Snowcrows for builds and guides, and I'd recommend joining a training guild to get you started (recommendations vary depending on if you are EU or NA). Good luck and happy raiding!
---
[https://snowcrows.com/](https://snowcrows.com/)

then no lasers!
---
Yeah in that regard you are right. I saw it so rarely in my weekly runs that i forget to mention it.
---
Autoloot or not, you won't loot anything when you're dead. And while a lot of people have the autoloot mastery, it's not rare when a boss dies with less than 10 ppl alive. And those dead people are probably the most prone of being kicked (we're not discussing about the kick being legitimate or not).
---
Also, there are some bosses where autoloot or not, you'll be too far away from the chest to loot it when the boss dies, and where you've to go to it.
---
A dozen please, I'm stocking up.

yea but OP was alive and the commander probably assumed they auto-looted so i'm not sure what you're getting at?
---
there are some bosses where the chest is far away..not kc, as in this case
---
There's a couple of ways I could see doing it. All of them involve manipulating whole numbers that already fit nicely into binary storage. It'd honestly be kinda dumb and pointless. 
---
&gt; I'd still like to be able to solo stuff aswell.
---
Since raids and fractals can't be run solo unless you're completely insane, that makes it sound like you're asking about open-world PvE. If so, there's nothing that compares to ranger. In open-world, ranger is 'easy mode' because your pet can tank for you and also do substantial damage while you're doing damage at range.
---
As a proof of an extreme version of this, WoodenPotatoes completed the entire personal story as a ranger without ever using any skills. He completed the entire personal story without ever using a weapon skill, utility skill, healing skill, or elite skill. The ranger pet provided all of the damage and he used positioning to avoid damage to himself. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-GAY0489EM
---
If you've been logging in they're free during their release.  The one above needs gemstore though if you haven't previously unlocked 
---
&gt;it is ridiculous that people are faking benchmarks to make chrono look bad and its alternatives look better.
---
I guess Youtube is in on it because nobody managed to publish a video of a Support Chrono doing way better that the "people faking benchmarks".
---
In raids Chrono is still the go-to pick on most bosses too even if Firebrand + Renegade are now viable too. You can also do a mix of them all, or put the Ren as the 2nd Healer if you play with 2 healers, there are quite a lot of options.
---
Also nice throw-away.
---
Seller was part of a guild that still advertises raid selling on EU LFG to this day. Maybe he wasn't acting on their behalf, I don't know, but it doesn't particularly matter. Still not going to carry his buyers unless they're paying us.
---
Besides, I learnt since then that this isn't an uncommon practice. There've been dozens of reddit posts about it over the months. 
---
That, soldier, is a threat.
---
They probably are using mighty infusions considering that necro has fractal god and the warrior has fractal champion.

---
If you bind a key to the mount/dismount *for that mount*, it should clear the bug. Using the default F9 that's bound as mount/dismount for whatever mount is currently selected won't work. You need to bind a key directly to that particular mount.
---
Doesn't it get balanced out a bit *depending on the boss* because Firebrand can reach better DPS than Chrono either because you run full Viper on Condi Quickbrand or because you have a better burst (or a burst on shorter CD) on Power Quickbrand?
---
Also when even if it's not the best composition ever it is still in the viable spectrum of things.
---
Like to do fractals but meant that it isn't my only focus.
---
Raids depends, do I need more than 30 min - 1h of uninterrupted free time to do them?
---
If so then no, since I can't guarantee. I'll be able to not be interrupted this long due to other obligations. 
---
I wish...
---
Will try this.
---
For W2Z2... after you do the feed the octopus bit and hit a checkpoint  Keep going and instead of turning left. Head right towards a cloud and a push block. There's an eagle nearby that takes you to the final checkpoint
---
It's obviously pretty open ended, but the first things I'd be looking at are getting ascended equipment, and getting proficient on more than one class (and more than one role). This means having a look at raid and fractal guides to have an idea of what classes are in demand for which roles and why. That doesn't mean you have to play meta classes, but is a good place to start.
---
Sorry, sw?
---
That's some nice bait, fresh reddit account!

You can even drop the druid for a Slb with spirits or even entangle if needed

Nope. Steam is very demanding on the partial profit aspect, which is why many mmos avoid it.

Do you sell Quaggan sized ones? If so I got all I need for a nicely tinfoil wrapped charred one.
---
Salt is provided by OP, and the torch I'll bring myself.
---
I find this a bit contradicting with the attitude most people seem to have tbqh.
---
If anything, I would think that clearing content with a build that's considered non meta would be satisfactionary because you stop playing safe (aka the meta) and get out of your comfort zone (the meta) by clearing content with a class ND build you enjoy most. 
---
I can be wrong but that's how it seems to me. 
---
Meh every single post these days has a top comment about being salty. Getting boring.

I really like the third one from right side. I belive its a thief using staff 5 skill but I might be wrong. Do you and your friends want to train more ? We could always send more pics so you two could train =P

&gt; your proposed solution would be amazing in..your very niche/specific scenario

To point out that his solution isn't only amazing in his very niche scenario

Hahahahahaha

in raids you should also stay meele though. open world its fine yeah. (even though meele is still better)
---
With no waypoint nor PoI, what kind of black wizardry is that.
---
Yep: gem cards. Purchase from a game store or, if you don’t have access to a brick and mortar store, from a trusted online retailer. PayPal is a good idea as well, but as a consumer you’re ALSO protected against theft by unauthorized users - check your card’s Terms and Conditions. Most limit liability to the first $50, but will typically waive even that if you report a theft quickly.

---
ranged weapons =/= ranged playstyle. in group content you stay meele, unless a mechanics needs you to to otherwise. period.
---
as someone else mentioned. in LFG look or create for groups with "non meta, chill, relaxed, fun, first timer welcome,...", you will save yourself and other a lot of trouble. in t4 at least you will find 95% meta groups which will expect a smooth and quick run. people tend to get very upset (aka toxic) if something will go wrong.
---
"And you can't say that because you and others think something is fun that it means it'll be fun to everyone (sorry if you didn't mean it like that but that's how it came over to me)."

no i did not say that, sry, my english is f´d. im just saying that the majority will be exactly like i told. do as you like but be very carefull which groups you join. best way would be to find some friends and mind the LFG alltogether. 
---
and in NO WAY i have judged you in any way, i just wrote what the current situation for most of the more seasoned player is, and some   facts how "not optimal play" will harm others people enjoyment. and playing range in group content isn´t viable to answer your question. its doable yes. but only if your group is willing to play this way. (harder)

From what i can gather from all the people i've asked how they did it. It's imagining something and working towards that image and repeating that proces and using whichever tool you think will help with that.

Much like how i learned to use Revit at the start. Eventually you learn your way around the tool and how you can display the information you want to display.

Try to improve your gear to exotic or at least rare. Then head on to defeat some world bosses, try out dungeons and explore the world and higher level maps

I don’t find wildly off meta to be as fun unless it’s pushing a goal. I’ve done some interesting meme runs: all scourge, all thief, early 2016 meta (in 2018) and going to attempt the Snowcrows viability competition this month.

I’m a druid main. I love learning more about it and improving my skill. I don’t play the most meta dps classes, but I still use meta builds on decent classes.

Making Warcatmanders

Am i the only one thinking that they actually plan something BIG this time? Regarding both EP6 and LS5
---
&gt; Time is valuable, you know? 
---
Excactly my point. So why does this one person deserve extra time after intentionally dragging 9 other people down and costing them extra time to find a replacement looking for half a run afterwards?
---
Get at least full exotic gear.  Then start working on ascended.  Once you get some ascended you can start on Fractals.  Start at Tier 1 (1-25), which don't require much (if any) agony resistance.
---
Do map completion.
---
I would say run some dungeons but the LFG on dungeons is pretty dead.
---
Do the additional story quests (Living World Season 2) if you have them, or if you want to buy them (for gems in the store).

1) Forgive me if you're already aware of it, but the wiki gives you a pretty good explanation of what upgrades a guild can get access to. Check out this: [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild). It links to Guild Halls if that's more what you're looking for.
---
The wiki in general is a very useful resource. You can find things quickly by typing '/wiki &lt;thing&gt;' into the chat box.
---
Have fun!
---
But did anyone actually try to dig there? I tried it when I went there to get the big bomb, but the chests didn't appear... I thought they might have just removed them. It is of course possible that I did something wrong though.
---
So to me it looks like you have two options.
---
Option A: get someone else's computer (like, siblings' or friends'), login there and get all the gems you want.
---
Option B: use a [paid VPN](https://kpsl.co/jd), they have more legal obligations. It's not like they're too interested in stealing from a student :D
---
I actually am starting to read the wiki, but there were simply so many things I was lost in the forest, if you know what I mean. Also, super cool that we can wiki in game! I didn't know that, thanks!
---
Careful, this is for some reason one of the touchiest parts of the Gw2 fanbase, and this line of complaining has gotten me kicked out of more than one guild.
---
The truth is, your complaints are VALID. Just because they're not someone else's problem doesn't mean its not a problem. I feel the same way tbh. Game is boring as shit once you've kitted out a few characters. Nothing like going back to queensdale looking like the grim reaper itself and needing more than one AA chain to kill a trash mob. 
---
Hi,
---
I have recently got some more spare time on my hands, so finally have the time to enjoy an MMO again. I played GW2 on release, so excited to jump back in. As a return "Vanilla" player I wanted a couple of pointers from some more experienced players.
---
**Currently**
---
\- Boosted a necro to 80 (picked my build)
---
\- Have not played HoT &amp; PoF
---
**What Interests Me**
---
\- Farming HP to unlock elite specs (whats the best way/fastest way to do this?)
---
\- PVP / I loved GW2 PVP some want to jump in with an elite build as soon as possible, how do I go about gearing for this?
---
\- PVE / I am not a huge fan of PVE would like to jump into this at some point to check it out, whats the most popular type of PVE to do/queue for?
---
As a returning player it currently feels unfamiliar &amp; overwhelming - seems to gives me little direction to what I should be doing (I know this can be a good thing), over time I am sure I will learn the ropes again.
---
Thanks

---
Some of them are nice but you need to practice your framing better.
---
&gt; do I need more than 30 min - 1h of uninterrupted free time to do them?
---
That depends on the group. With casual players, you'll need MUCH more than that. With a serious, coordinated group, that time limitation is mostly no big deal.
---
Also, bear in mind that you have no idea what classes will be needed for raids in the future. Skill balances routinely make huge changes. If you're going to level your character to 80 by playing the game (rather than using an instant boost), it's almost impossible to know whether that class will be relevant by the time you're ready to raid.
---
i can return. if they can do that, it would be great. The only problem now is how the system is now and we dont know what they are working on. 
---
April fools was yesterday, you're a day late.
---
Given how long W2 is in relation to W1, I'd expect about 2 hours long, with 2 Checkpoints.
---
There’s nothing to do. The game is dead. PvP is dead wvw is dead.
---
What kind of discussion do you expect to have with someone saying that one has to be better than the other?
---
Surge of the Mists should cast Signet of Humility on every hit tbh
---
&gt; You’re level 80 in a level 10 zone and it will take the same amount of effort to kill something of your level.
---
Huh? I happen to have just finished doing map completion (again) and that's not even remotely true. Mobs in zones below level 60-70 die from you sneezing in their general direction. The scaling does jack shit for actually scaling you down, you are still ridiculously OP for those level ranges.   
---
&gt; Weapons: You’ve reached level 80 and you’re expecting some nice juicy new weapons with crazy stats.
---
Is that true in Black Desert or whatever game you come from? Because in quake I don't expect to get new weapons when I level up..for lack of leveling up.   
---
Uncontrolled power creep through gear progression does nothing to improve the gameplay.   
---
&gt; There is no point for grinding out weapons or better said “There is no point for having legendary weapons.” 
---
Legendary weapons aren't in game for stats.   
---
If you cannot live without grinding new gear with 1000000x better stats, GW2 is really not that kind of a game.   
---
&gt; Why would you grind your heart out for something that’s not going to benefit you in the long run?
---
You speak as if wasting your life on some other video game is going to benefit you "in the long run". On the other hand, we are all the same after we die, right? Hard to fault your methodology, at large.   
---
&gt; Dungeons and Events: No point in running these for the rewards, you can buy all of these loot drops from the market
---
You cannot buy dungeon-specific items on the market.   
---
&gt; It’s all about these damn cosmetics..
---
So if you don't like it, don't play it? I don't play the FIFA games for instance, couldn't care less about a bunch of idiots kicking a ball. 
---
Here's what I recommend:
---
* Watch the [Living World - Season 1 Movie](https://youtu.be/d17gwV4vXOg) since Season 1 isn't available to play.
---
* Start doing [Fractals](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractals_of_the_Mists), they came out during Season 1.
---
* Try out [World vs World](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_versus_World) to see if you like it.
---
* [World Completion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Map_completion#World_completion)
---
Once you're ready to start paying and move on...
---
* Purchase &amp; play the Living World - Season 2 content
---
* Purchase &amp; play the Heart of Thorns expansion
---
* If you're into some more difficult content - start doing [Raids](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Raid), they came out with HoT.
---
* Purchase &amp; play the Living World - Season 3 content
---
* Purchase &amp; play the Path of Fire expansion
---
* Purchase &amp; play the Living World - Season 4 content
---
I find it hilarious of how easy it is to be hated here in this sub reddit, one comment that is slightly more honest and ”rude” and there you go, you have the white knights coming at your neck. 
---
But Truth hurts as people say
---
Everything was intended here, if you want, I can give you some tips on that
---
“SICK EM’ RACHEL!”

I figure. Alright I'll just tell the other party members to do it while I smash the gate lol
---
Veteran Chak Blitzer: "Hello there"
---
As I said, nothing works if you don't actively dodge/ aegis skills,  these are just builds, your level of knowledge and skill are what will make you hard to kill.
---
This was taken mid air, you can notice that one of the legs goes over the head. Also, it stays like this underwater aswell
---
And Subject 6 Deep-Sixer.
---
If u dont have an expansion, u cant gem to gold as f2p
---
Xfinity happening a lot over the last month
---
Also, Season 2 can be played (just for the story, won't get rewards) if you just follow someone who owns the episodes. I did that with a friend and saved a bunch of gems /u/Randor01
---
&gt; Like who the hell looks up the latin names of interesting/beautiful plants and alters them slightly to make them sound more like a person
---
lol thats literally my process of coming up with Sylvari names
---
REALLY NOOB QUESTION ALERT:
---
what this "EA" means?
---
The only real reason to purchase the expansions before you get to level 80 on any character is if you would like to try the Revenant class as you need at least one of the expansions to make a character of that class. Outside of that I'd say wait until you get to level 80 or if they go on sale and it is too good to pass up.
---
Not sure why you are downvoted, this is the truth. If you get shit like this in WOW, you get mailed your loot by the game (not without exceptions, but it generally works). 
---
Regardless, if the choice is either that or the magic ones the argument still stands. If it is a glyph, the animation or some alien gardener that does the garthering is irrelevant. The point was that it's more value getting the magic ones as the magic can be a hazel to get, where as I doubt faster animations really matter unless you only do gathering.
---
Buying either expansion will unlock your trading post and remove all free-to-play restrictions. FYI you *do not* get mounts for buying expansions. The mounts are obtained by doing story steps in Path of Fire or performing other tasks in Path of Fire. There's no way for you to do anything in Path of Fire below level 80 unless you get somebody else to join your party and carry you through the mission. 
---
If I were in your shoes, I would buy Heart of Thorns immediately in order to remove the free-to-play restrictions and then watch for Path of Fire to go on sale. They usually go on sale for 50% off about every 4 months. Since they were just on sale, you're probably looking at July for the next sale. If the $15 difference doesn't matter to you, go ahead and just buy both expansions now to get it over with but remember that gliding and mounts both require that you play parts of the expansions in order to unlock them.
---
Get PoF and immediately use the 80 boost on a character you're mildly interested in playing. Then with that character do the very first part of the PoF story to unlock the raptor mount for all characters on your account. This will also give you decent size account bound bags you can swap between characters on your account. These two things alone  provide incredible QoL for all of the content from 1-80.
---
Seems odd to have this page launch without any sort of announcement, or am I missing the announcement?
---
The fact that I am kinda lost regarding which panel reads into the next means that this is a very accurate depiction of TD.
---
Bit late april fools.... looks realy good though :)
---
If it’s a hoax it’s very well done
---
This looks like it's real.
---
I'm terrified...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx5N-4JvVyk
---
:O Are we serious right now???
---
Obviously fake. But this is way too elaborate for a fake. Not to mention that its an entire day too late for Aprile Fools.
---
Is this actually real? Not an April's Fool joke? omg
---
 long-requested feature of build templates is in the works.
---
wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut
---
Mother fucking yes, finally. 
---
would have fooled me if i didnt read the guildwars2.com post about whats next for guildwars 2.
---
&gt; In theory you should have PMed the squad learder and asked what was wrong, 
---
I did PM the squad leader, and got no response.
---
&gt; instead of going defensive and begging for a higher force to help you and punish the wicked. 
---
I'm convinced you didn't bother reading my post, or you're completely incapable f understanding the English language.
---
I never asked for them to be punished. I asked for the system of denying loot to other players be made less abuse-able.
---
&gt; If thats your dps that was crap, you should have knew that before switching to bs 
---
What does have to do with being denied loot **after** a boss was already killed?
---
&gt; Communicate, you're a human being with some fingers for sure. 
---
I literally am communicating. The fucking irony here.
---
&gt; And yes, at this point autoloot assumed as baseline, 
---
Well it's just objectively not base-line though, which is why Anet should implement changes to the system.
---
&gt; so I think they did want to give you your loot, otherwise they would have just kicked you earlier. 
---
Good for them... This still has nothing to do with the changes i recommended such as having the chest be given as a clickable above your mini-map.
---
10/10 for deflection of the problem. Good job.
---
dual greatsword warrior still exists ;)
---
Never gonna give you up.
---
I don't play hardcore, I have no legendary gear and I rarely play real endgame content, but this has me excited.
---
Build templates will be a godsend to even the most casual players; I enjoy warrior in both wvw and PvE, so streamlining the swapping between the two is going to be very nice. I can also imagine it's gonna be useful on the rest of my characters when I finally get around to playing them in different ways.
---
Legendary runes sound interesting, if they work how I imagine them to then they'd be a great quality of life improvement for those already fully kitted out with legendaries. Not to mention I'm intrigued as to what visual shenanigans Anet will come up with. 
---
Reading this actually laid my worries about the future of GW2 to rest. This doesn't look like a usual write-off from a game developing company - it's a clear letter that promises refreshing updates, with both having the bigger picture and game principles in mind, and going into some details about what's coming.   
---
Hearing that they now have 4 fully stuffed content teams AND separate teams for PvP, WvW, Rewards and Skills - fills me with joy and excitement for the things to come.
---
whoever made this, well done.
---
but also fuck you.  like, seriously.  go fuck yourself.
---
Are they going to try to monetize templates?
---
Will legendary runes will have better stats than exotic runes since technically we don't have an ascended rune tier?
---
Guess fractals are dead. RIP.
---
Jewelcrafting seems like a waste at this point since every one and their cat can get ascended trinkets through different parts of the game. Please don't add cosmetic infusions to jewelcrafting. The game is already visual cancer.
---
What I'm not seeing is much of an incentive to stick around with the game beyond the LS finale and the next raid. QoL additions are nice but playable content makes the game. (No, I don't want more raids. Stop wasting time on content that very little of the player base plays.)
---
&gt; Scavenge the sea for materials to craft a new tier of cultural armor for every race
---
I cri
---
I think they meant AE
---
&gt;The rune and sigil salvaging release last year was in anticipation of releasing legendary runes and sigils—the final components of legendary core equipment.
---
This is only concern I have from this patch, and really only because of how this could potentially be implemented. Legendary weapons/armor doesn't offer any advantage in terms of stats, it's really only for convenience, but runes and sigils are a different thing entirely. I'm wondering whether or not these runes/sigil will have better stats than other ones, or if they'll be able to switch to current runes/sigils. 
---
*Max cooking level to 500.
---
Yesssss.
---
ERP SOON POGGERS
---
Talk about simple...
---
&gt;After that, the **Current Activities Team...**
---
Say no more.
---
This team is AWESOME!
---
A bit more hyped for Current Events than I am LS4, to be honest. Rofl
---
All in all, it's nice having something to look forward to.
---
Does that mean there isn't expansion 3 in the works? I don't understand - this clarification is more confusing to me than it is clarifying. How many content teams they have (they say four moving forward) means nothing if we don't know what they are working on.
---
&gt; The Living World of Guild Wars 2 is a great way for us to accomplish all of that. It’s the best way to provide our player community with regular content updates—great features, new horizons to explore, and an engaging story that brings our world and characters to life—without charging a subscription fee.
---
I'm really anxious that "Living World" (episode releases of mini maps with a few story instances) is their vision for all of GW2 PvE content and growing Tyria. To me, Living World was a fantastic _addition_ to expansion, but was *never* a suitable replacement for expansion. I personally think the mood of the community pre-HoT clearly expressed this - players wanted an expansion, not small content updates.
---
If there isn't an expansion in the next 12 months, the expectations for Season 5's ability to satisfy the growth an expansion brings will be impossible to meet. Season 5 will need to include expansion features players have come to expect (specifically elite specs) if it's going to replace a third expansion.
---
If they are delaying a third expansion for a long time I just point to Final Fantasy XIV and WoW - expansions two years apart. This is the superior way to bring life back to an MMO and revitalize the experience long term. Two years is a good time frame for an expansion (that will be September this year - two years since PoF).
---
Because they definitely only started working on QoL after the layoffs. 🙄
---
* The rune and sigil salvaging release last year was in anticipation of releasing legendary runes and sigils—the final components of legendary core equipment.
---
 * I hope these are account unlocks we can apply to any gear from the Equipment panel and not items cluttering the inventory and bank.
---
* Over the past few months, astute players have been noticing a trend of updates and improvements to how our skill-slotting system works and have accurately speculated that the long-requested feature of build templates is in the works.
---
 * I hope they are something to share builds regardless of you having the parts required for it or not like in GW1, and have something different that keep your gear in its slots to quickly switch between pre-set builds, something more like 'build loadouts'. Templates and loadouts can exist together, and while templates would just be free for all and allow you to go to sites like metabatle or gw2skills to download them and share builds with people in-game, loadouts would store the actual gear and could be monetized by letting people buy extra slots per character or per account.
---
 * I also hope these work with account unlock not just items, without having to carry countless different pieces of gear or having to get full sets of legendary gear for all your characters. 
---
* We’d like to increase the max cooking level from 400 to 500. This crafting profession needs a refresh to make lower-tier foods important to the ecosystem and help reinvigorate various resources throughout the game.
---
 * Eventually it'd be nice if they also added a fishing mastery and mini-game, and to craft bait we'd have to salvage food to get 'food crumbs' required for the bait recipes. 
---
* We’ve mentioned in the past how important world restructuring is to our WvW initiatives, and that hasn’t changed. While the Programming Team is focused on this initiative, the team is also focusing on smaller updates that can temporarily change the game mode, like the No Downed State Week we’ve done in the past. We’re also talking about different types of reward structures for events. 
---
 * I would love to see more meta-events other than the middle one. Imagine if each supply line from a camp to a keep was a meta-event, and defending a whole supply line granted bonus rewards the more parts of the line are under your team's control.   
---
1000 gems to everyone!
---
Very well done hoax.
---
The end of Season 5 is still a ways away, like 2020 away. Doubt they want to spoil all their future plans.
---
Somehow I completely forgot about that. To be fair, I normally never have any reason to switch to qwerty, qwertz etc.
---
\&gt;and we’re excited to not only announce a release date   
---
No release date announced. :D
---
wow. would have been hyped for that...
---
for anyobody to lazy to translate the new krytan runes:
---
never gonna give you up [hidden within all headings]
---
april fools [at the bottom]
---
Why would you not agree with anything on here? Serious question. Maybe I can expect skeptisicm in legendary sigils and runes but honestly ... its to be expected. Im just hoping theyre not going to cause you to look like a new years fireworks display.
---
As always, it's a shame we can't dye the back.
---
Okay nice to see and while I don't want an announcement of an expansion I'm interested in a few things. They say four fully staffed content teams now some questions on this what are these content teams is it still 3 living world teams, raids and fractals combined teams and maybe an expansions teams. Secondly the release time episode 6 being delayed is understandable but its good to know they are at the wrapping up stage of development so hopefully it will release in April after the current events update. Season 5 will it be 2-3 months or longer. Its good to see communications and I think this would be a good time to do an AMA so players can scrutinise and ask questions like with living world updates and hopefully they will do one.
---
From what I understood theyre not working on one. But thats a big YET. Theyre focusing already on finishing season 4 and starting development on season 5. Its very possible that they are now debating on their next course of action PAST season 5.
---
This post makes me happy. Nothing more to say!
---
They’re excited to announce, not excited to announce today. 
---
Like children excited for Christmas, on jan 1st. 
---
Yes go to Anets page (not GW2) then go to our games it doesn't show anything about wave of shadow.
---
No mention of elite specs :/ but im.glad we're getting communication
---
Alright, I've been critical of peoples' presumptions about this since the restructuring, but they really do seem like they're taking a more active and open approach to communication. Good on them, it's a proven model that they should probably have been using this whole time.
---
Also.. BUILD TEMPLATE HYPE!!!
---
Thread removed: Too much self-advertisement.
---
Lot of people had been complaining that Raids tired in with LS sometimes holds them back. Personally as long as it's not something linked to or spoils LS annoucements Im happy for this, because it opens the window for Raids appearing... whenever

---
Yes. inspect element and it says ''hire me anet''
---
I appreciate the communication but its hard to get excited when there aren't dates on anything and everything is subject change.  Reminds me of the WvW alliance update that was announced over a year ago that still hasn't happened.
---
Obviously disappointed that there's still no mention of a post-LS5 expansion. That's the number 1 thing I wanted from the update. I need no details, just a "yes". There's going to be four content teams. Surely the live game can do with only 3 of those?
---
Other than that, big a 👍🏻 for the communication. Especially for the details we usually don't get: on the teams, the upcoming raid, build templates, and other upcoming features.
---
Also, I really like that they are finally pacing content releases out a bit more (the raid won't release the same day as the episode) and I think it's really cool that there'll be a bit of additional open world stuff. I imagine this won't be much, perhaps a small outpost in some corner of a map with a bit of NPC dialogue and a singular event, but it should be nice.
---
&gt;for example, we could focus on expanding the boundaries and content of an existing map if that would provide a better experience than creating a new one
---
This has potential but obviously we can't judge it until we see it. I really liked the changes to Brisban in One Path Ends (White Mantle base instance) and to the Highlands in A Bug in the System (Inquest base instance), and those weren't even proper open-world changes like the quote implies might be coming. I hope ANet finds restraint with this and doesn't break continuity again like with Lion's Arch, Kessex, and Dry Top's little mining town.
---
&gt;Ultimately, this will mean a relatively steady release of new content
---
The 2012 dream—hopefully—permanently realised after 7 years. We got a taste of it during LS3, PoF, and early LS4. I hope we get that back.
---
More smaller map additions and more side stories sounds great. New big maps are great too but they cost a lot of work and I'd gladly trade one or two per season for more regular content updates for the existing maps.
---
Roadmaps that aren't set in stone or have a speicific date are great.. it allows players to know what is being worked on to a degree and what to expect.
---
&gt;The Competitive Team has been working on the idea of building a festival that highlights both sPvP and WvW. It’s a fun concept that would allow us to focus on those game types and try new things.
---
Festival of the Mists.
---
Get hype.
---
Yeah. It is. Just read the bottom text that says it was made with love by Bubbles minions.
---
Ascended sandwiches, please.
---
Interesting.
---
&gt;  we could focus on expanding the boundaries and content of an existing map if that would provide a better experience than creating a new one
---
I hope this leads to more quality maps. I don't mind less quantity, if the maps are actually better. A new half-baked map every 3-4 months, isn't working.
---
We are taking the opportunity now to reorganize ourselves into four fully staffed content teams with additional teams dedicated to supporting the core game like Skills and Balance, Rewards, WvW, and sPvP.  nice fairy tail,i hope its gona work as good as last one.
---
**THIS IS NOT A REAL EXPANSION.** 
---
**THIS IS A LATE APRIL FOOLS JOKE. NOT A REAL EXPANSION.** 
---
See this link for the latest from ANet. Living World Season 5 is still the next content. There is no new expansion coming at this time. https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/
---
To OP: I have removed this post. Yes you did an incredible amount of work on it but you had 24 hours yesterday to post it. By not posting it yesterday and posting it today on a Tuesday you knowingly tried to troll the community and it worked. Because ANet has put an actual announcement today this is being removed and will not be put back up as it is a fake and we have real news today.
---
lol
---
Legendary gear always has the same stats as best available. Legendary weapons had exotic stats until late 2013 when ascended weapons became a thing. 
---
Those upgrades could have an equivalent of stat selecting only changing bonus types. 
---
They could also indeed be more powerful but release alongside ascended upgrades. 
---
They could be purely cosmetic. 
---
Hard to tell with w post that says what they are working on without much information on what those things actually are. 
---
NICE
---
COOKING UPDATE YESSS
---
So much communication, and all it took them was getting rid of Gaile....
---
LOL Go to Preorder and its lost in the mists xD
---
Ahhhh I'd actually love for an underwater expansion as well xD
---
Can i help you guys with Training? x3 Love that artwork :3
---
Oh I didn't read all the way. I didn't want to get hyped. Happy cake day btw.
---
Is that custom artwork behind the largos showcase? The other pieces of concept art could be from anywhere but those are clearly largos and I don't remember any GW2 artwork with that many of them.
---
&gt; The Competitive Team has been working on the idea of building a festival that highlights both sPvP and WvW. It’s a fun concept that would allow us to focus on those game types and try new things.
---
This is a great idea and PvP combat in GW2 truly has great potential, but before you roll out something that could potentially revitalize these gamemodes, please note one thing: the biggest problems with these gamemodes don't have anything to do with the gamemode itself. 
---
It's balance, more specifically powercreep. Unless you tone everything down, these gamemodes have no future.
---
 Build swapping is gonna be insanely expensive. 
---
Well they did a good job at making it look professional.
---
Are you sure about the leap skills? Don't see it on engie rifle 5 or sword 3.
---
Oh, wow, took them half a decade to invent a feature we already had in GW1.
---
TY NCSOFT
---
I'm very glad they're open to releasing content faster by visiting existing maps. New maps are fun at first, but the world is getting too large with empty zones with no reason to revisit. 
---
If they release a living world episode spanning over 2-3 zones with new story, NPCs, meta events, and rewards at a faster pace, I'm all for it!
---
Well, it's actually very easy to learn, there are simple grids you can follow to change the dynamic of the image, like centering subject is usually considered "boring" (there are exceptions tho, like in my case thief was centered to further show "impact line" and vertically positioned in a way, to show the impact strength) and subjects are moved to specific places to help the composition, to show the dynamic, weight.
---
Here is visual aid with grids on my characters: https://ibb.co/zrySj4p
---
There are different grids, for example my ele follows dynamic symmetry grid to increase perspective effect, to make it pop. Rev and Guard follow same grid to increase dynamic of the subject, both vertically positioned to show the weight that is going to be lifted by the subjects.
---
But dynamic symmetry is just an extension of "rule of thirds" grid (this one you keep seeing in your phone) and with this you should start your reading.
---
Rest, like Ranger, War, Mes, Engi and Necro follow simple golden ratio rule, but as you can see on mesmer and warrior, dynamic symmetry applies too.
---
Hope it helped you understand the concept a bit, you can google any of those terms to learn more tho.
---
Just a little scary with how open they are about their content teams. 4 teams working 8 month release schedules for example, gives about 2 months between releases, which is an excellent cadence, but doesn't leave room for a massive project in the background. However, if it is 3 teams working that same 8 month schedule while the fourth team is permanently working on an expac, then releases come out every 3-4 months again, which is more like what we are experiencing now, and is a bit painful without the knowledge of something greater in the far future.
---
Forgive the very simple math, it isn't meant to be accurate, just to show an example.
---
&gt; But thats a big YET.
---
No, that's a big YEET
---
Not one mention of new elite specializations as being even a possibility in the future. God damn it.
---
They have said numerous times that they are moving away from expansions, yet people constantly seem taken aback when no expansions are announced.
---
Mike Zadorojny: Hello everyone, today I wanted to unveil a huge piece of news you've been waiting for; the title of our **upcoming Guild Wars 2 expansion: Wind of Greatswords.** A mysterious force has replaced every Warrior's arms in Tyria with greatswords. The mystery leads to the Dominion of Winds, where the Tengu have long complained of the other race's consumption of "chicken wings..." 
---
**FEATURES**
---
- Every Warrior now has greatswords instead of arms. 
---
- New WvW mastery: scalable walls
---
- New emotes, such as "shake hands" and "rock, paper, scissors"
---
Stay tuned for more information in the coming weeks!
---
WHOEVER did this got my hopes up for NOTHING!! UUggGGgHhhh. ITS NOT APRIL 1st!! 
---
However the website is awesome looking and I WANA MAKE A PIRATE!
---
Just sayin!
---
That dolphin..and a sea turtle..why you gotta play me like that 
---
**It is a late april fools joke.** 
---
Only official ANet news today: https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/
---
Funny, that doesn't look loke Max and Chloe...
---
was it all fake? 😭
---
This is very reassuring, but still would have been perfect time to remind us that expansion 3 will still follow Season 5
---
&gt; Happy cake day btw.
---
I'll think about it, it really is simple tho ;\]
---
There it is... This is proof the damage done to the roster was the wake-up call they needed. They're telling us about their plans now. They've never done this...
---
Things have changed. Let's see where this leads.
---
Yes :c
---
I would love this chair if it was a real wood log with critters and plants instead of using the SAB graphics.
---
For anet starting a project was never a problem. Finishing it was. 
---
With a couple big distractions gone they are less likely to pull people from one project to work on and still not finish another. 
---
I suppose we will see if that translates to more of the things they work on making it to live.  
---
Depends what you mean by that.
---
Nothing they said is indicative of how large the teams are or how many people are working in the background that ARE NOT part of these 4 teams.
---
It’s all because of the layoffs and restructuring 
---
PRAISE THE 5, BUILD TEMPLATE WILL COME SOON™

You really just need to have more toughness than your teammates, but if you pug frequently you are fated to find some 1600~2000 toughness "offchronos" so you will have to go higher unless you kick them.
---
Only some fights like largos and desmina are hard to tank with 1100 toughness, if you miss your blocks you will probably get downed.
---
When I started chrono I had 2 complete sets, at some point I had 46 ascended equipments on my chrono... then I got legendary stuff. But overall you can have full diviner and get some knight trinkets as they are really easy and cheap to get, with food you can easily achieve 1500+ toughness. 
---
no expansion I guess  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Just tested it again. It seems to only apply to skill that trigger an actual jump. Rocket boots, E-gun 4 and most likely Ranger GS would trigger the effect. 
---
What kind of evil are you? 💔😭
---
This one is by far the most interesting to me. 
---
Beyond possible stat increases, what other functions would they have? Are they going to essentially be ascended style but with purple naming, as in just higher stat values and nothing else? Is there going to be an aesthetic component (shudders)? How are they going to be made, one at a time or in bulk? 
---
Where did that come from?  They said after episode six which is likely sometime in May.  How does that translate to July or later?  You're pulling shit from thin air and now being a cunt to people who disagreed.  You have 0 proof, so fuckoff.
---
One little text and all the kids have hope again.
---
Was hoping for an end of April release, but realistically we're looking at Mid May - Early June. With my luck it'll be Mid May right in the middle of finals week haHAA.
---
Thanks for noticing this, uploaded a new video. Doesn't seem to work on warrior sword leap unfortunately. 
---
This was sorely, desperately needed, exactly the kind of rough roadmap without committing to deadlines that might change and lead to player outrage. Not only that, but this almost reads like April Fools, Anet confirming officially they are working on so many features the community has been requesting for years to the point where they have become memes, like 500 cooking or, of course build templates.
---
Good work, MZ, thank you for this. My trust in this game was severely eroded over the last year or so, but you are definitely taking huge steps to rebuilding it and I am sure there are others out there that feel the same way.
---
Now if only you could confirm whether you are planning a third expansion... But I guess if that ever happens, it's too far down the road.
---
I come from the future, Mike Z just annouced this will be a thing
---
Fair.
---
pic of the chair?
---
- World Completion
---
- World Bosses
---
- sPvP / WvW
---
- Gear your character in Exotic+ for the build you want
---
- Fractals
---
- Dungeons
---
- Jumping Puzzles / Achievement Hunting
---
- Super Adventure Box (or other Festivals as they happen)
---
- Fashion Wars
---
No mention of a console release or dx12/11 update :( hopefully in the future we can see this.
---
What a time to be alive
---
Have you updated arcdps yet? There was the release last week with SAB that broke arc like always, and it's been updated since then.
---
We've known this for months.
---
Out of the many restructures, this one sounds more promising. I hope it sticks.
---
I'd love for cooking materials and crafting to increase in worth. A lot of the account bound food from Living World and such has undermined this.
---
Not sure why people were expecting it to release within the window after what happened. People hyping themselves up for disappointment once again.
---

---
I think it's the motes/symbols you get from salvaging. 
---
Sounds great.
---
For me personally, outside of build templates nothing really stood out.
---
I do not love the idea of expanding maps vs new maps. New maps were fun to explore and complete. Expanding maps can run into issues with over-writing old content, preventing players who do not have it unlocked access, or whatnot. Expanding maps may also lead to smaller areas of addition with fewer things to do. It may be OK, but I have my concerns.
---
Going a bit more of a breakdown...
---
Top part is just GW2 in a nutshell, nothing new, just their mission.
---
2nd part: I do not have interest in PvP/WvW. The living world map part makes it *seem* like they are diverting resources away from making maps, to expand on pvp/wvw, which is something **I** do not want.
---
Next part is literally just telling us that they are delayed in their releases, which is understandable and expected, but hardly something to look forward to.
---
Then..
---
Runes: this seems OK I guess. It's not something that I care about at all. Legendaries are too much *work* and not enough *fun* for me to have ever embraced.  
---
Build templates: awesome  
---
Cooking: I am not loving the idea of having to spend 100 more gold to keep my cooking relevant. The other part seems like it'll be good, if done well.
---
WvW/PvP: don't care about this stuff
---
It was a bit vague, i mean can we assume this is the trajectory of balance; barriers and more invulns etc. I almost explicitly pvp, and it is quite apparent that Scrappers have and extremely forgiving toolkit
---
i tried drawing the "Reee" extra shitty, since their Voices are somewhat scatterish 👌
---
console release would a gigantic waste of money, imo. 
---
If I had to guess, they will be runes and sigils we can swap to any other time or sigil. So they would technically take up inventory space when not equipped, but you could put them on a set of gear and just change what they are even while equipped. What has me worried is if they will be easily removable to change what great set they are on without salvaging the gear. 
---
Now just Player Housing and Cantha expansion and this game will have everything I want:-P
---
i'm probably going against everybody else. by now i have at least two characters of each class, each one with its own different build, so build templates is not that exciting. besides, these alts have mostly exotic gear, so it's not that i can change it to the main class.
---
And where do you see "No expansion" in the "What's next for guild wars 2"?
---
Really sounds like there won't be any more expansions.
---
Actually, at this point I take almost for granted that they have NOT an expansion in the works. Even more after this update. If there's something they have been constantly repeating over and over again in the last few months is that they think the Living World approach is perfect to deliver the content they want to make and that Living World can function well even to release "expansion worth" content. In this announcement they repeat the same thing and there is no mention, not even in the far future, of expansions.  
---
Now this does not mean necessarily that they will not release an expansion in the future. But it seems pretty clear to me that it tells it is not something they are actively working on. I think, however, that Season 5 may very well bring content that we usually associate with expansions (like elite specializations).
---
Personally, to be clear, I hope I am wrong and an expansion IS actually in the making. But all signs just seems to point this way, or at least that's my impression.
---
My point was some certain individuals were acting hostile towards me for making educated guess based on past release of raids. I certainly wasn't expecting it to be released together with Ep6 but after. They might be back on track with w8 but at this point I got disappointed too many times to have any hopes left.
---
&gt; Because they don't release raids outside 3-4 month content drops?
---
This is subject to change considering the circumstances.
---
Oh man, imagine it in the style of "Bough of Melandru" backpiece. Mossy log, small leafy tree and a bubbling creek running in front of it. I'd pay even 1000 gems for such a thing.
---
That festival is probably a year away minimum. They'll have multiple balance patches before them.
---
What I wonder is if they'll provide tutorials for players 
---
Great news, loved to read about everything.
---
My only concern may be about the legendary sigils and runes. I loved the idea but....how will they work? Most legendaries are basically skin based, sans Aurora and...the legendary ring. But even then, they provide stats other accessories can provide. But what about the runes and sigils? Will they have unique gameplay effects? will they be craftable (as in, more than one set)? Or maybe they will have mechanics similar to existing ones, just having a new shiny effect on then?
---
Heck, I got my 16 characters, if they made 16 of those and all of them are good, I'll go for it :P
---
They can't survive without expansions imo. Problem is that they forgot about expansion after PoF and focused on new secret (now cancelled) projects. So if they will start to make another expansion will be now and next months. So either way, will not be any expansion soon, but I think we'll get one after season 5 (or game will die because people are really bored of LW episodes imo).
---
&gt; They've never done this...
---
You must be new here. They did this almost semi-annually when Colin Johansson was still working for ANet.
---
Though they didnt stress so heavily that plans may change, which resulting in community outcries when they did change, which resulted in ANet no longer doing these roadmap posts.
---
Anet in the past advertised LW season 1 as "expansion worth of content" and reality destroyed that picture quickly.
---
Most of the metabattle builds seem to be pretty good, at least for your average reader that comes in because they have no idea what to build.
---
 The variations are going to depend on individual groups and guilds. Like bringing in a raid build to a pug zerg will be a nightmare on certain classes like scourge/rev that need competent FBs to pick them up. 
---
Well that sounds a lot more reasonable and down right exciting. 
---
I need to start working on my legendary armor now, but that means I either need to get more involved in wvw or convince some guildmates to finally take up raiding with me.
---
That's a good start.
---
I really want to help gw2 and anet by buying things in gw2. But I will only buy meaningful things like content or account upgrades (and i'm done with those available). There wasn't a mention of an expansion which is sad since it would mean that I won't be able to contribute to the game. Even a new dungeon with 3 paths at 10€ would be great.
---
Again, right after HoT we knew there is already a team for next expansion even though it was 2 years ahead. Currently we have no such confirmation. And since Zadorojny never answers questions about expansion directly it's pretty telling they have no plans for one currently.
---
Neither did they even put a name on said teams either. Could very well be 3 LW teams and the 4th is the expac team.
---
To add clarity, the green screen makes the process much easier, but you still have to remove it in Photoshop. 
---
Worst part for me is in 2-3 where it's all ice and there's ice spikes on the floor and you have to jump from cloud to cloud quickly before they light you on fire.  I hate it. 
---
I come here because news happened. Just saying now isn't exactly a great time to be a hardcore gw2 raider. Gimme them tasty downvotes.
---
Everywhere. Since lw4 started zadorojny in very single media points out how cool lw is and how big content they can deliver with it. Whenever he's asked about expansion, he points out he can deliver "expansion worth features" with LW. This is classic deflection. There is no expansion planned currently.
---
ANet is really hitting their second wind despite their circumstances from earlier this year... Let's hope this lasts...
---
That was before the lay offs and restructuring, for all we know GW2 would've continued with living story for a while or gone into maintenance mode after season 5, then Anet would release a new AAA game. Now that they have been forced to re-focus on GW2, an expansion would be good to create hype and increase sales, especially outside of the GW2 community as "new expansion" attracts more players/sales than another "regular update".
---
11 LAZY FUCKS KNOW HOW TO USE DOWNVOTE,BUT DONT KNOW HOW TO LEAD. OK, I COMMANDED 200+ RAIDS,SO I RLY GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU. BUT YOU YOU CRYING PLEBS CAN MAKE ONE FULL SQUAD,SO I GUESS GL WITH RAIDS? I JUST LOVE WHEN LAZY,USELESS PPL,GONA CRY ABOUT SOMEONE ACTUALY DOING SHIT AND MAKING DECISIONS AND THERES ALWAYS THAT ONE PLEB WHOS HURTING AND HES CRYING,BCS HE CANT PLAY,BUT HELL HE CAN CRY. GO ASK ANET FOR RAID EZ MODE.
---
Makes sense given the nature of existing stat swapping, but I do wonder if/how this could potentially effect the economy. But 'Legendary' has to actual mean something, and be worth the effort to access it, though I suppose there could be an aesthetic upgrade involved. All very intriguing either way.
---
So i was playing some berserker gear firebrand in WvW and  one thing that bothers me really bad, is the fact that it seems to be a  necessity that i give my party stability.
---
i  like to support my zerg and my commander for the most part but with  stability in particular it comes with so many restrictions to builds and  gameplay that it just puts me off playing firebrand.
---
my  first problem is that i'm never free to move and under constant  pressure while playing because i have to be ready to pop stab at  any point in time. i'm not questioning that you need to be sticky at  your tag, but being responsible for the first stab in combat puts it to a  too high of a level, in my opinion and i find it at least off putting  to not be able to get a sip of my drink or to clean up my inventory in  peace for a second because i constantly have to be on standby.
---
second  of all, it limits my builds because i sacrifice a whole MASSIVE DAMAGE.  it's especially frustrating when the stab becomes redundant because some  random stab was thrown on top of your's'std've when the commander called for  one. IF the commander called for one that is, because it may just as  well happen, that the commander forgets to call for stab, which happens  quite often, especially after the first one and the fight lasts long  enough so your stab comes off cooldown during the fight but you don't  know if you should just use one for a push or if the commander wants to  hold on to it. and i dare you to take stab out for another skill,  because, oh boy, you'll be in for constant whining and/or rage when  you're one of the few firebrands in the squad and nobody is willing to lay  down a stab when it's called. which results in a squad-kick at least and  if you're unlucky, verbal abuse and more flame.
---
**TL;DR:**  so, finally after all the rant, my idea: why not give commanders a  special-action-key that comes with a starting cooldown when first  tagging up that gives you a stack of stability? you could make it so that,  as a commander, you get one stack for every 15 or so players in your  squad and each stack gets its own cooldown, just like an ammo-system.  i'm all for communication and coordination and those who do it best  should outperform others but the mechanic of stability feels  unnecessarily restrictive and is a huge risk factor for toxicity, i  think.
---
If OP reposts with a similar title, could it stay up?
---
That also means there's zero predictability of when to expect one.
---
Being lucky to get a single raid per year is not a good sign for retaining long term hardcore veteran players.
---
This applies to all content. Just because a specific content may not interest you, does not mean that content is not relevant and thus not important for the health of the game. To treat it so, is to be willfully ignorant.
---
&gt; Is that completely out of the blue, or a feature people have been speculating about?
---
Since the change of salvaging them there was a recipe that popped up in the forge for 250 of each symbol/charm.  That has led to speculation of legendary ones coming eventually 
---
They literally said in that post that it wasn't part of a living world drop.  Do you read or?
---
They’ve made no mention on if they’re working on one or not. Expansions take a long time to make and are fine in the background - *if* they’re planning to release one after s5, they undoubtedly already have it under way.
---
How is that in any way related to what the PoF expansion team is doing now?
---
It wasnt confirmed until nearly a year after HoT, when S3 began. They told us what was coming after the current season (at the time, Season 3). They've told us what was coming after the current season again (Season 4).
---
There is nothing telling us what comes after Season 5 just as nothing told us that Season 4 was coming after PoF until they began working on it (if not later).
---
Once we get done with this season of LW, I desperately want to pay money for next season's content in a mini-expansion type of way. I'm totally willing to throw money their way for this free content.
---
&gt; Now we got something that is almost a confirmation of no expansion 3
---
By this logic, we can also almost confirm there will never be a new gem store chair because it wasn't mentioned.
---
Also, you should've clarified you meant proceeding season 5, toots. :)
---
Pretty sure the former is about not doing things like non-shared harvesting nodes, and the latter is about allowing people to do things on their own and not having things require multiple people too often
---
So a lot of QoL things, and some minor updates to come... Does not look good for this game.
---
There is no culinary application for bloodstone dust!..
---
Yet.
---
Time will prove one of us right, pumpkin :)
---
&gt; 2nd part continued: I do not love the idea of expanding maps vs new maps. New maps were fun to explore and complete. Expanding maps can run into issues with over-writing old content, preventing players who do not have it unlocked access, or whatnot. Expanding maps may also lead to smaller areas of addition with fewer things to do. It may be OK, but I have my concerns.
---
Not if done right. The way their game works story content is locked off unless its active. Which means they can expand old maps and allow everyone to see it. Look at Dry Top and Silverwastes. While, yes, those maps were attached to Core rather than an expansion that doesnt mean that the new updated areas are going to require PoF. Especially if its an Ascalon map thats getting expanded rather than a Crystal Desert map.
---
Do people still play this game without an endless upgrade extractor?
---
For the final time! Bloodstone Dust doesn't have any culinary applications!
---
We don't even know if anything comes after season 5.
---
Don't worry, time will prove one of us right, pumpkin :)
---
Ah, I missed that completely. So potentially some of the groundwork is already in place.
---
It's like Anet has been asleep for 7 years.
---
In every way. Anet already baited us with living world being "expansion worth of content" which is historically proven failure.
---
For me it would be the fact that there is no mention of an expansion.   
---
Actually, it's yet another update that quite clearly says they think the Living World approach is all they need to deliver the content they want to make.    
---
While I can understand this choice, especially now that they have a smaller number of devs, I still think that big expansions contribute to the life of a game and to its visibility to new players in ways that smaller updates just cannot. 
---
Never thought about that, it would be absolutely brilliant!
---
I was more referring to the fact that you cannot enter Istan without the Daybreak story unlocked. Say you had  A Bug in the System and that shared a map with Daybreak, but you did not have Daybreak, how would they lock you out - or would you have full access to the map
---
Most likely this.  You will probably right click a regular exotic rune/sigil, consume it a-la "add to wardrobe" and then you can always change your legendary to those stats.
---
So you'll at some point have to buy one of any rune or sigil you plan to use, and bind it so your legendary can ue those stats.
---
***Pure speculation, of course.***
---
:)
---
"It won’t fall within the two-to-three-month window that we tried to target throughout Season 4 because of the adjustments we had to make in February"
---
Very precise, that. Can technically mean a 2020 release. :P
---
Might wanna change the link in the post. lol Thanks for your work!
---
Sounds like wildstar was more your sort of game.
---
In your case you gain very little from the addition of build templates and lose nothing from the addition of build templates. So how exactly are you going against everybody else?
---
Ah yes, the type that gets angry when someone takes a minute longer to get their stuff together....
---
Yet they don't give a damn about holding other people up.
---
Build templates is awesome, maybe I'l come back to check that shit out with my myriad of alts. 
---
Wish they'd do some sort of engine overhaul like DX11/12 and have some form of anti-aliasing worth a damn (Game looks like a stringy aliased mess)
---
It was intended to be a tanky bruiser, which worked in early HoT (and works now, maybe a bit too tanky though), but got nerfed out of existence in all modes. It's been slowly coming back since PoF, but the last patch seemed to be a bit too generous.
---
As much as I welcome the outlook, I really do, I believe it when I see it. Build templates are arguably already too late, next raid wing might as well be the last and noone else needs build templates really but raiders.
---
The stuff that was mentioned to be confirmed features has to come out this year, not later.
---
How do build templates relate to the leveling experience at all?   
---
Where have they even started to announce the system's functionality that you make long winded rants about?   
---
You are probably thinking in terms of Rift build templates, which were not what the community have been asking about, but rather leveling up guidelines for noobs. What we want instead is a way to have gw2skills.net functionality in-game. You are just completely missing the point here.   
---
yep. why should i invest in that? by the time it pays off i may have quitted the game
---
It’s not about extracting, it’s about not having to carry around different full sets of runes and sigils for each of your build templates. Lego runes and sigils will probably be stat swappable like the armor and weapons, so swapping templates just swaps the stats on all your equipped lego gear.
---
Id like to see a console release someday, but imO they'd have to rework the new player experience first, since all platforms will benefit from that - the best way would probably be a slow patchup to a final release that also sees the game on consoles
---
Nice twisting, pumpkin. Unfortunately, currently we dont even have any knowledge if there is expansion 3 team. Probably not :)
---
I kind of hope they do, but the runes need to be better balanced against each other than exotic ones lol
---
these are almost exclusively rework and qol updates because, as they said, LS will continue a different path with 4 Teams working on it, contrary to the 3 we had till now
---
you dont need to keep 100% meta all the time.    commanders is still highly viable .     same is for sigils and runes.    and that is what guild wars 2 is about.    if they wont bring out any balance patches we still would run full warrior teams which is simply bad
---
Market speculation, go!
---
NP, glad there was an easy fix!
---
You will get some tokens that will allow you to instant level him to 80.  It is recommended to level your first character normally.
---
No, I asked "where are all these people that worked on other things and weren't laid off", and your answer is "living world episodes aren't expansions worth of content". See how those two statements don't follow?
---
They have to save a few fan favorites for tough times. They can whip these out and placate the player base.
---
Wrong. We already knew expac 3 is in works. They confirmed expansion team e.g. during LW3S1 AMA.
---
Content I can't play is not content.
---
Thank you!
---
sorry, I expected the gw2 community to want gw1/Arc DPS style templates
---
That means they've got the people working on a new product. They've said that a company that isn't always working at something new is a dead company, so that might be it.
---
True. My point is that this post makes no touch on what comes after Season 5, and thus nothing says "no expansion after Season 5" let alone "no expansion 3".
---
Though the post mentioning 4 teams is a bit telling imo.
---
Then they obviously wouldnt do that as it would be counter productive.
---
I can see you believe in Anet. Time will prove one of us being right :)
---
As for those "people", Mike said they are going to buff live content teams, which means more LW, no expac.
---
First and foremost, there is no mention of fractals. I guess we won't be getting any new fractals in the near future thanks to the layoffs? Whats even more concerning to me is the content we can expect to get with each episode of living world 5, since the apparently want to focus on expanding and polishing existing maps, we most likely won't be seeing any new maps any time soon, if at all anymore. It's also very likely that wing 7 will be that last raid wing the will release, since it just takes up way too much of their ressources to create a new raid, especially since the team is much smaller now. 
---
This means that most PVE Content we will be getting is going to be focused on the Open World, which is disappointing, since Open World Content is offering no challenge whatsoever and tends to get quite boring after a while, but this is just my personal opinion. Hopefully the release windows are at least going to be smaller again, since this whole thing seems like they are going to be going back to the roots in the style of living world 1, just that this time the episodes are going to be replayable. Lastly, I'm kind of worried that we are not going to be getting another expansion.
---
Some positive things though: We're getting communication! 
---
I'm excited for the new raid wing! 
---
It's great news, that they are still working on the WvW restructuring and also on smaller updates, which as a casual WvW player, is something I'm looking forward for. 
---
Build templates are also in the works, looking forward to those as well.
---
They can't fit raid into ep6 release and you think they will finish it on time within a month? How gullible. It doesn't also doesn't say there it comes right after ep6.    
---
In case you big dumb, which I believe you are.   
---
"and will get its own release after Episode 6"   
---
Might be a month might be 3. Your guess is ass good as mine sweetie :)
---
&gt;It won’t fall within the two-to-three-month window
---
Come on, only one release was actually in that window. Why pretend it's even a thing when it's so rarely been followed?
---
Wait its not April First anymore?  This is real?
---
Yes, that's my point. They're afraid of admitting no expansion is coming ever again so they gonna keep fasade as long as possible.
---
&gt; "Did you get clear and open communication from Anet?"
---
Yes.
---
&gt; "What did it cost?"
---
[Everything](https://i.imgur.com/kgz8u6i.jpg).
---
Now there's an answer, and if that's what he said, I guess an expansion is a pipe dream.
---
How would arcdps style template even affect leveling experience?
---
And honestly the nature of designing stuff like this... If you talk about *everything* in development in specifics, you end up sharing about things that might get canned or repurposed. Focusing on the stuff that's already confirmed or nearing finalization is probably a much healthier thing to do.
---
However, I agree with the op of this comment train that I wish we had some kind of indication as to what to expect for LS5. The news post was a bit vague in that regard... I got the feeling like the devs were/are trying to find a compromise between pushing out more free stuff and finding a better way to monetize without a $$ item like a paid expansion. It's no surprise to anyone that revenue spikes when a new paid expansion comes out, though I do love how long I can play GW2 without having to worry about a sub or expansion.
---
There's 3 LW teams and 1 fractal/raid team.
---
&gt; if they’re planning to release one after s5, they undoubtedly already have it under way
---
Not really because that decision would have been made recently or in the coming days. Remember that they actively took that decision because they were splitting resources into their mobile department. Which is why we got season 5 instead. But now that they had to shift back their focus to GW 2 ONLY. They can now choose to make another expansion which WOULD NOT be in the works. At least not within the past half year. 
---
Hey all, this is a concept I've been working on for quite some time. I was hoping to have it ready for April 1st yesterday, but there were a number of cross-browser bugs that needed to be ironed out (and I'm sure there are many more). I hope you all enjoy it!
---
They just did: https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b8m1o8/fansite_guild_wars_2_wave_of_shadow_underwater/
---
YES!! I can't believe they even brought that up. Is this a dream!?
---
Indeed. I find the write up is vague enough that I can wait until I see more details to cast judgement. However, it raises a bunch of concerns.
---
Thank you all for the advices! I'll see to better myself as a Guardian of Tyra!  
---
See you in the battlefield against the Dragons ;)
---
They haven't followed that content pattern since S1 for that very reason, but just because you don't like the implementation doesn't mean that that content didn't exist. I'd say all the other LW seasons gave us enough content in total (for free as well) to warrant calling it expansion-sized. 
---
Right? One of the best posts I've read in a while. They didn't dive into specifics, but I could tell by the way things are written that they're taking a hard analysis at life in the game.
---
Because season 3 for the most part, if not all of it, actually stuck to that release window. It wasnt something they chose for Season 4 only.
---
Remember, PoF launched a couple of months AFTER season 3 ended. Dont know why people only attribute the 2 to 3 month wait period EXCLUSIVELY to season 4.
---
&gt; The commander’s tale will continue in Living World Season 5. As the teams get going and plans become more cemented, we’ll be able to talk a bit more on that topic.
---
They can't say "no expansion" because they literally admit they're unsure what direction to go.
---
"We haven't decided what to to" != "We won't do this".
---
I would be shocked if build templates were not locked until level 80. There is no reason for them for leveling and they most likely will just add them to the existing level 80 unlocks.
---
this is the sort of communication we've desperately wanted and needed for a while now and im really happy to see it being done.
---
Or you want to talk to people.
---
The content of that time mostly doesn't exist. So if it doesn't exist, it doesn't exist. It's that easy.
---
Build templates doesn't necessarily mean gear swapping as well. 
---
I don't think so. It's an enormous QoL update and compared to other QoL updates, they won't sell anything of this for gems. 
---
Also keep in mind, that we already have ArcDPS build templates. Even though this system is bugged af, I think many people would still keep this, instead of buying more official build slots.
---
Anet, thank you so much for the openness! This is what I have been waiting to hear. Everything mentioned sounds phenomenal, especially **BUILD TEMPLATES**!
---
Thread removed: Duplicate post, please check the recent posts for a similar one and use that. This includes making a comment post about a another post.
---
So do you mostly just use two sets of trinkets now? One for toughness fights and one for other fights? Do you always use the same food?
---
&gt; They'll have multiple balance patches before them.
---
Each balance patch just makes this game worse unfortuntely. If they want PvP to be good a year later then they have to turn things around quick.
---
&gt; But as you said, the future will prove you wrong.
---
Nice twist. I'm gonna wait here and see you kneeling before me once reality destroys your wishful thinking.
---
I enjoyed the secret rick roll :D

I did and it kept taking me to the "buy expansions" page.

Mate, I appreciate the explanation but I was saying that you should practice more. 
---
 2 , 8 and 9 are heavily imba, the upper parts are empty while the characters are sitting in the lower area of the photo. Even 5, 6 and 7 are pretty borked. 
---
Honestly it wasn't even that aspect that I hated the most, but rather the quick tie up of Lazarus' story.
---
Wow Anet, wow.
---
I love this, I'll be here till the end! ♥️
---
Ok, but you're picking apart a single season of content that was done as an experiment since nothing like it had been done at the time. The content from seasons 2 and 3 is still around and with all the maps that were introduced at the time, I'd say it's worthy of being called expansion-sized. Not a large expansion, but an expansion nonetheless. 
---
&gt;Build templates are in the works
---
Now THIS is an appropriate time for an AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!  🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉
---
drop mike. walk offstage.
---
&gt; rock, paper, scissors
---
i would legit love /rps @ to decide who has to go into certain roles in raids
---
A roadmap?!  From Anet?!
---
There is actual hype here!  Build templates, set in stone teams, chef to 500, jewel to 500, WvW and PvP updates, etc.  This is what we needed to hear.  Its been a rough few months so the hype buildup is nice, even if some of these items won't happen till next year.

&gt;Cultural Armor

&gt;Scavenge the sea for materials to craft a new tier of cultural armor for every race - including the new Largos 
---
when it's too good to be true. aquatic plant armor for sylvari for example. Kristen Perry, the designer behind the Sylvari was saying on her blog how she toyed with ideas like that but they sadly never made it into the game
---
"How many times do I have to tell you, THERE ARE NO CULINARY APPLICATIONS FOR-  oh wait..."
---
b-b-b-b-bbbbuild templates? *Cardiac arrest*
---
Took them almost 7 years, but it's good to not only have it at last, but have them admit they're doing it on purpose:
---
&gt;This sort of discussion of projects that we’ve kept under wraps until now is a departure from how we’ve been communicating for a while. It’s our hope that through posts like this we can help clarify for you what our priorities and goals are for the game. And while this isn’t everything we have planned for the game, it at least gives you better insight into its development. The team is passionate about not only supporting Guild Wars 2, but continuing to grow it alongside all of you.
---
This is the first step to put the game back on its tracks, and leave the doom and gloom far behind the hype train.
---
I don't think they will introduce new runes or sigils (i.e. ones with better stats), just introduce ones on which you can freely swap between different runes and sigils, like stats for legendary armor and weapons.
---
this isn't a roadmap. You should look up what a roadmap looks like in other games. people in this community probably forgotten what a road map looks like anymore.
---
They have to phrase it like that for an optimistic post about the future. "adjustments we had to make" = "how we dealt with a bad situation". You can't open your roadmap with "WELP WE GOT FUCKED"
---
Fantastic job, and thank you for crediting your sources.  I hadn't seen [Mitch Aseltine's](https://www.artstation.com/mitchaseltine) work before and it is awesome.
---
Yes, but they only work this way due to features introduced with expansion related to that content.
---
I hope they don't shoehorn story into updates just because. We don't need every update to be about Dragon's Watch and present events, just improve and expand the game wherever it feels the best, and leave the Living World story for the new content.
---
man i don’t know if i like that chair or hate it

CATAMOUNT!!!
---
Hm.. well, guess the windows snipping tool becomes obsolete.  
---
Sounds like he already has something up his ass, judging by the post
---
I think they may be restricted to Normal difficulty and above. When I ran it last night for the bomb expansion, I ran under Infantile and neither \[bauble\] chests were available. 
---
Communication!
---
I don't agree with they will launch it on that day however look at previous episodes the trailer for the next episode has released the same week they have done a run through of the previous episode for example episode 1 was played through the same week as episode 2s trailer released.
---
Which core class is good in WvW with 160-200 ping ? And any build recommendations
---
I wish they would add also a guild team, I would love to see more focus on guild halls/missions and such... anyway I'm so excited after reading this :D
---
agreed. but PR speak is always fun
---
&gt; Theyre focusing already on finishing season 4 and starting development on season 5. 
---
If they are still working in 3 LW teams as they used to, that would mean that the first two episodes of S5 are already in the making. 
---
Someone gild this man
---
By that logic you could claim that any mmo that isn't around anymore never had any content at all because you can't play it now. Just because you can't play now it doesn't mean it wasn't a reasonable amount of content at the time.
---
I would personally be immensely surprised if they have stat increases. Legendary in gw2 has never been about stat increases, just the QoL of being able to change on the fly. 
---
Is that a new vanity item? I usually skip SAB 
---
It was never reasonable. It was 2-week farting season.
---
You are perfect customer for Anet, keep up the good work. 
---
Not goin to happen. You need a system that promotes guilds and their environment - the thousands of random casual pugs - to work and improve together. You know, to promote that healthy fun atmosphere they were so adamant about. 
---
Alliances still doesn't accomplish this; and still just gives guilds thousands of random pugs to deal with. And no guarantee they'll be able to fight opposing guilds of roughly their level in WvW at all (determined by PPT, still).
---
Which means fight guilds remain in EOTM and pug-based guilds continue to not have a real reason to exist; as they are entirely at the mercy of their pugs unless they recruit them (which leads to stacking alliances, LUL).

&gt;expanding the boundaries of an existing map
---
Honestly I think this could be a good idea! Expand the playable area of some maps and make those new sections for higher level players. Not only would we get new stuff to explore, new activities and what not but also we'd have a reason to return to central tyria or whatever zones they expand. Cuz I'm high key bored of PoF zones and HoT zones.
---
Also because it wouldn't be an entire new zone, I feel as tbough they could realistically have these bits of content out on a regular basis. 
---
&gt;* We’ve mentioned in the past how important world restructuring is to our WvW initiatives, and that hasn’t changed. While the Programming Team is focused on this initiative, the team is also focusing on smaller updates that can temporarily change the game mode, like the No Downed State Week we’ve done in the past. **We’re also talking about different types of reward structures for events.**
---
What do you think that last line could mean? Types of reward structures?
---
How exactly do you get the red infusion? 
---
More likely they're going to make more of the low tier food as ingredients for the new highest tier food. To get from level 400 to level 500 chef we're probably going to get ascended food. Imagine coming four different types of steak to get ascended steak...
---
Well, this is certainly something. It's a lot to digest, but I feel like it would be worth putting my immediate thoughts out for some discussion. First, the team restructuring: at first glance I think this will be good for the *overall* content output pace of GW2, but I'm concerned it will potentially hurt specific areas if not managed carefully. Having four larger teams with no specific focus should also ensure a higher overall level of quality for a given release, which would be nice considering how underwhelming some recent LW Episodes and (allegedly) Fractals have been. I think there are a few things we can deduce from the change:
---
* We will very likely not see an expansion after LWS5, and unless ANet significantly recovers from the recent losses they may never be able to produce another while maintaining their targeted content output. They could, in theory, dedicate one of the four teams to producing an Expansion over a longer period, but that would largely negate the benefits of the restructuring so I'd be surprised if they took that course. This, in turn, raises the question of how they plan to make up for the resulting loss of income, but as much as it pains me to say it "letting go of more than half their staff" may well have been the solution to that.
---
* Larger festival updates (such as, say, SAB World 3 next year, or the continuation of the Zephyrite/Bloody Prince subplots with their respective events) suddenly became much more likely, as they can now dedicate more resources to them without hurting output in other areas as much, if at all. It remains to be seen if they end up actually moving in that direction, but as a big SAB fan it's certainly encouraging.
---
* Four larger teams will, on paper, allow for more regular updates, but those updates will likely also be smaller. Of particular note is the fact that the new Raid wing will be releasing after S4E6 - we can likely expect more such staggering in the future, as opposed to the big bundle releases we've seen over the last year and a half or so.
---
* This new structure might allow more resources to be pointed towards PvP and WvW, at least occasionally. I'm sure a lot of players would appreciate this, although what form such renewed focus would take, if any, remains to be seen.
---
Overall I feel optimistic for the future development of GW2, but I also say that as a player who focuses mostly on Living World PvE content - Fractals and Raids may see less frequent (although ideally larger and more polished) releases in the coming years, although that's just speculation at this point. Moving on from all that, let's look at the major updates they've announced:
---
* Legendary Runes and Sigils: I honestly have no idea what to make of this, or what sort of form they would take, or even how much they would cost to craft. Upgrade components are, even with the recent price increase, massively cheaper to craft than the gear they go on, but making their Legendary versions proportionately less expensive might make them more accessible than intended. I'm not even going to speculate on functionality, but there are a lot of directions the devs could take them, some cool, some annoying, and some both. Hopefully we won't have to wait too long to find out.
---
* Build Templates: Freaking *finally*. It remains to be seen whether the community at large loves or hates the ultimate implementation, but it's nice to have confirmation that our speculation was on point.
---
* Level 500 Cooking: Another unexpected addition, although not as much as Legendary Upgrades. Part of me is concerned about the impact it will have on the late-game meta, but it also could create a lot of interesting possibilities in the same space, so overall I'm excited.
---
* WvW Restructuring: Not really much news here, but at least it's still in development.
---
* Swiss Tournament Support: Well, it's something, I suppose. I haven't exactly had the impression that anyone actually *wants* this, but it's better than nothing.
---
All in all, I think all this bodes well for the future of the game. The next few months will be critical in ensuring ANet recovers from their recent downturn, but based on what has been outlined today I feel confident that they'll be able to pull it off. Where the game, and the studio, goes from there is still up in the air, but I get the feeling GW2 will still be kicking many years down the line.
---
Build templates have been discussed for the past 6 years. Lol. Nothing has been done or touch. 3 more years to go maybe~
---
Hmmm. 
---
So is there finally a reason to return. 
---
I always kinda figured they had plans for an expansion after season 5. Just that season 5 was gonna 6 more episodes and thus putting expac 3 in 2021 territory. Maybe they want that sooner now? Maybe only 4 episodes (based on that 4 staffed team thing?).
---
Would instant get my $$$ for CE 
---
What the what? Something resembling an actual roadmap from Anet? Is it still April 1?
---
One of the things that excite me the most about upcoming GW2 expansions are game-wide changes (like masteries and mounts) and elite specs. As there weren't revealed any plans for an expansion, I'm worried about those two.
---
Living World seems likely it'll come out faster, with four teams working on it now instead of three, and with more flexibility to rework existing maps instead of always adding new maps. That's cool and definitely an improvement.
---
Feature patches are being worked on as well, with build templates, crafting expansion and legendary runes/ sigils on the way. That's cool too.
---
Nothing seems to have changed for WvW and PvP. We're still getting the same promises of world restructuring and swiss tournaments someday.
---
Nothing seems to have changed for group content. Nor for guild content.
---
Nothing about expansion-level of game-wide changes nor new elite specs.
---
2 things
---
1. got any recommendations for a cheap staff and axe/warhorn skin for this character: https://imgur.com/a/NRFRZer 
---
2. so the pDPS soulbeast snowcrows page after latest balance patch uses thief runes and dagger, it says sword is still perfectly useable but was wondering would i still use thief runes with sword? or would i just stick to scholar?
---
Holy crap a roadmap.... Checks calendar.... APRIL FOOLS WAS YESTERDAY, GUYS. This is real! Yay.
---
Touché 
---
Reminds me of The Tom Green show when he takes his parents out to dinner and makes an announcement that he will have announcement the next day.
---
&gt; (more applicably) new races
---
Btw, reminder that the tengu still have an area of the map sectioned off for their capital city that is right next to a starting area, and that the tengu were originally playable.
---
Just food for thought.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b8l3gb/whats_next_for_guild_wars_2_guildwars2com/ejye609/
---
&gt; Legendary runes and sigils? Is that completely out of the blue, or a feature people have been speculating about?
---
Well, I've been speculating about it but never rly hoped for it or even shared my speculation
---
I always use the same food, trinkets, and weapons but using leggy armour, vary my runes and stats for any needed toughness.  If you carry your normal runes (pack/surging/leadership) and herald/durability, you can get all the toughness you ever need from just the armour.
---
Fractals, Dungeons, Worldbosses.
---
u/Euryleia provides a practical example, but from a proof standpoint one of the fun facts about real numbers is that if *a* and *b* are not equal then there must exist a value *c* such that *a* &gt; *c* &gt; *b* or *a* &lt; *c* &lt; *b*.  What we find for 1 and .9 repeating is that it is impossible to construct a value *c* to satisfy this requirement.  There is no number greater than .999 repeating and less than 1.  Therefor 1 and .999 repeating are equal.
---
Might have changed,but the go to was previously a sigil of bursting.
---
Been saving up keys just in case this was going to be a lootbox-only thing. I'm relieved it isn't, but now I have all these extra keys. :P

Did you kill a bunch of bunnies?
---
Well here is a polygon article on ESO about how the player base is on consoles/PC:
---
https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/14/13283030/elder-scrolls-online-player-numbers-console-pc-split-matt-firor-bethesda
---
He says it’s about 30% on each platform.
---
And FFIV combines console with PC so it’s difficult to say how many is on each platform.
---
In any case with Xbox having keyboard and mouse support anyone could play if they want to use keyboard or mouse. 
---
As much as I looove some of the Season 4 maps I agree. Kourna feels empty while Jahai feels awesome. Sandswept Isles are really cool while Istan ended up just being largely there for Palawadan, but Palawadan made money so people left the Isles. And Thunderhead Keep looks awesome but has like nothing in it. 
---
Meanwhile in Season 3 a bunch of the maps feel kind of tacked on. Ember Bay anyone?
---
Meanwhile the core PoF maps have metas that few people run. I only just managed to get to the end of Serpant's and we failed to complete it anyways. 
---
I hope this post will skyrocket to top of this page and make them see what us players with love to this game want.   
---
I love the icons of specializations and thief is a pirate!!
---
That's my take. Make it so you aren't forced to interact to get things done as much, and if you do interact with other players it's a positive interaction.
---
If you sit in the SAB chair, and there a fart, are the effects localized or passed onto the whole box?
---
This is a community run subreddit, not an official support channel. If you're unhappy with your support experience then you should go back to your ticket and ask for it to be escalated. We can't do anything for you here
---
July sounds reasonable, I doubt it'll come out in June. In recent memory, when has ANet ever released a major content (not festivals or balance) patch a month after a previous one?
---
It could be different this time due to the restructuring.
---
&gt; No, I had to install gw2hook (gw2 specific fork of ReShade) and use greenscreen preset using Adaptive Fog shader, with that I was trying different skills, animations, emotes etc to capture good screen, then simply isolated green background.
---
You think that would be too much to ask a video on doing this from you? That's a really neat trick. I actually manually mask in photoshop and this could save so much headache!
---
lets see if the community learned what "subject to change" means as well
---
Mirage is in no way shape or form a support spec in WvW, its a roaming spec.. What are you gonna do for your party? Give them your mirrors? Maybe you can play Chronomancer with gravity well and a focus (which you can do x2 because of f5)
---
By your logic I can slot some other stuff over usual support skills because "So many guards run the usual support skills". So in which situation is having multiple veils bad exactly, Or portals if they're used in NA (Not seen much in EU)
---
I do not understand the "While other classes support their people by simply doing what you usually do" line when you play mirage, Something that has so little support for a party or zerg. The "other classes that support by simply doing what you usually do" Choose to run this support or they can always reroll to whatever they like (like DH, Ranger, Core thief) and your zerg can get 1 pushed.
---
Why exactly do you choose to run mirage and cripple yourself and your zerg by a suboptimal class/spec. Also not showing any respect for the commander who has to deal with pugs not listening, running builds like this and still having the patience to lead?
---
I can understand people being not happy with the state of mesmer in zergs because Anet gutted it because they refuse to ever balance wvw on its own but this, I cannot wrap my head around it, You run a meta in pve, pvp, but magically in wvw you can run w/e you want?
---
I'm not really sure how you got that from this post. 
---
Mmmmm, Banana Sweet and Peppercorn Spicy Ascended Butternut Squash Cream Soup, my favorite. Just like grandma Agnes Elanor Betsy-Jo Luann Martha Ester Marie used to make. We called her grandma Elanor Betsy-Jo Luann Martha Ester Marie for short. 
---
She was never the same after her husband, John Everett Oliver Noah Jasper James Anthony Edgar EightfirstnamesMcGee, died. They were made for each other.
---
I so want the idea's presented in this concept to become reality! :O
---
What was the cost?
---
I owned the game since before launch but haven't played in ages, because I don't like the monetization model for the living story, and was bored of all classes but the two I capped out at the time. What happened?
---
It doesn't matter how long it will take them to finish it. They stated that they want to release it seperately after Episode 6 and also create some kind of open-world content that will go with the raid.
---
Oh yeah that would totally be an interesting pick too.
---
Small-scale stuff in an existing map. They’re not going to delay finished content so long just to stretch out releases. 
---
Well, they praised living story as being the best way to deliver new content, features and experiences, while expansions were not even mentioned at the bottom of the post in the long-term planning section.
---
In my opinion, you only need a roadmap for your customers, if your game is subscription based for players that contemplate to book a long term sub or if you ask for a pre-purchase (like an expansion), so they know what they are buying but both isnt the case for GW2.
---
Yes transparency is good
---
a guide overall as a profession? 
---
It's going to be hard to find guides for any of the classes as you're leveling, to be totally honest. Most builds and guides are designed for end game level 80 characters, who have every skill unlocked.
---
For those kinds of guides, you look on websites like metabattle (general), snowcrows (raids), discretize (fractals), and vabbi builds (WvW). 
---
Luckly is your opinion
---
This is.. Ugly
---
Fair enough. My concern with expansions was always the WoW problem (which they've recently taken steps to deal with). At some point, there are so many expansions and add-ons, it gets overwhelming and maybe even confusing to return or jump in to the game. I think the piecemeal LS episodes/seasons add a great deal to this for GW.
---
Try everything and see what you like. Engineer has a ton of options.  For some good open world builds you can check out metabattle.com, but you should really try everything while you are leveling. 
---
Squirtle is that you?
---
You have a very nice voice if not edited, and trust me I am very critical on others' voices...
---
Hmm. But losing expansions would mean some pretty drastic changes for the games. Whole new systems and specializations were developed as a part of the xpack creation. Lumping that all in to living world would be very difficult.
---
Like, would they release new specilizations all in one living world episode or would they slowly release over the course if the season?
---
I'd like to see a citation on that.
---
Reminds me of the cells in that show "The OA".
---
google Out of the shadows ama, good luck :)
---
1. No idea atm
---
2. Sword is still fine the difference will probably be barely noticeable: they did separate benchmarks with Sword, Dagger or Axe as main hand a few patches ago and the difference was 200-500 DPS at most. So if you play pSoulbeast often in raid I would recommend changing the runes but you can keep the sword.
---
Thread removed: Stirring up drama is not allowed.
---
Of course it was fast, the game provided him with no real content to make videos about recently.
---
I think everything boils down to 1 question - will there be an expansion after season 5. If not, no gemstore gimmick will keep the game floating.
---
while that dude might not see much positive for himself in the post, you are feeding him wrong information on top to convince him of your own opinion. we don't know whether or not there will be another expansion, just that we get a season right after the current one. anet also indicated that they might have plans to include bigger features, the like you would expect from expansions, into that following season.
---
FINALLY
---
I'm so happy they announced it today and not yesterday. Narrowly dodged a bullet
---
Blah blah blah, baseless assumptions.
---
Dominion of the Winds as expanded LA??
---
F
---
Right. Its still starting because theyre not finalized.
---
Because who loves a game being RIDDEN with microtransactions? I'm a Wakfu refugee, an mmo that turned most players away by becoming a cashgrab.
---
Hey, reddit can be confusing.
---
Nah, I just like picking apart flawed arguments.
---
I can see "disable other players chairs" option coming
---
(shrug) Probably beceaus its the most relevant. But season 3 shipped with the same cadence.
---
World Completion! Everyone should do it at least once without mounts and Gliding. :)
---
Yeah and especially considering that they mentioned how they are keen on focusing on horizontal progression rather than vertical
---
A few days ago in a fractal run one person requested a kick on someone else as a joke (we were on voice, everyone knew it was a joke) and then canceled it, but it wouldn't go away for the rest of us. We had to actually kick and then reinvite him for the UI to clear. Could be you had the same bug.
---
The have to. They painted themselves into a fucking corner when they added legendary armor and stupidly made those rune slots swappable. One of the dumbest things they have ever done, because if they add build templates with actual usability, or finally fix runes to be the glorious build modifiers they can be, the massive amount of people who built legendaries not for the collectibility or the prestige, but for the benefits, will rightly call bait and switch. The only way they can build them is if build templates take the armor out of your inventory, which is a travesty because the guild wars 2 inventory is fucking miniscule from a relative standpoint.
---
And yet he spent the last few months doing a lets play on the entire personal story, including different branching paths and different character races.
---
Hes not starved for content. Youre just being cynical.
---
Anet please release something so I can spend more money on you now
---
Let me try to answer: 
---
1) Big chunk of content at once, a big "get-together for everyone. In between expansions, I log in once in an episode release and forget about the game again. 
---
2) Marketing exposure. Big releases make news, attracting fresh blood. This is good for the health of the game. 
---
HYPE THRUSTERS ACTIVATE
---
coming back to record 7 year old personal story is exactly proving my point
---
Keep repeating this to yourself, it makes you feel better :)
---
I think this looks like shit.
---
First, can we please not downvote for subjective disagreement?
---
A lot of people want new players to experience GW2 as it originally was. I very much disagree with this. Original GW2 core content was not great. I along with all of my friends bought the game when it launched and quit after about 30 or so levels. The new player experience has not been revisited since the game originally launched. 
---
I can tell you right now that if I had a raptor mount and some decent bags I might have actually made it to level 80 back then instead of coming back to the game 6 years later. The primary reason I came back to the game was because of all the buzz I heard and read about how great the new mounts were.
---
GW2 features the greatest mounts and mount system mechanics in the entire genre. If you want new players to keep long term interest you don't point them towards the worst content in the game because of your nostalgia goggles. You hand them the best fucking mounts the genre has ever seen and bags big enough to not want to quit due to tedious inventory management.
---
GW2 core leveling experience is the worst content it has to offer. This makes sense because it is the oldest and least refined content in the game. If you want GW2's best content you want to check out their expansions.
---
My guess is season 5 is what their expansion 3 was supposed to be but they had no devs for it so now they have develop it bit by bit.
---
We Charr are worthless. Can't even die right.
---
Gives me conniptions.
---
thank you for this communication &lt;3
---
As I see it, there are a few directions it could go. Legendary upgrades could be freely removable from gear, for example, or could be swapped between different standard upgrades like how other Legendaries can swap stat combinations, or maybe both. Alternatively, they could let players create their own custom effect combinations (although that only really makes sense for Runes), or it could be something else entirely.
---
I'm happy for that... Look at Luke Skywalker now ...
---
He's dead so definitely more happy than I am currently
---
So, there's lots of content, but because it's 7 years old it's bad? :/
---
I guess I have a different perspective because I started playing GW2 about 18 months ago. I still feel like there's a lot to do. But for folks who have been here from the beginning there has been very little in the way of new content. Living world releases every few months are insufficient in this case. Hopefully ANET is either planning for an expansion or will restructure living world 5 to be expansion-esque.
---
Well good news today, eh?
---
Icon design of elite specializations is so good! I totally fell for this, esp since today's April 2nd :D Well played.
---
&gt; I guess I have a different perspective because I started playing GW2 about 18 months ago
---
But if we pretend it's not a case - the point flew over your head entirely. The point is not that content is bad. The point is, that WP is long established content creator and even he had nothing to make videos about for some time because game is in hybernation. Unless you count lay off coverage as good PR for the game :)
---
So yes, the fact that his main content for some time has been 7 year old personal story is a symptom of game getting sleepy.
---
Meh?
---
You got people who want to use their own builds. They won't have a problem because they will continue their own thing.
---
You got the people who just want to follow a guide and use something someone else has already worked out. Templates would make that easier.
---
You got the people who simply don't give a damn about anything and just use something random. This won't affect them.
---
Last group I can think of would be the various people with all sorts of different specific issues. This change will affect some of them. I guess you would be in this category.
---
This is beautiful and absolutely well done. 
---
Of note, it's kinda laggy on my laptop so perhaps some optimization could be done, but gj otherwise!
---
can you take a vid?
---
&gt; We’d like to increase the max cooking level from 400 to 500. This crafting profession needs a refresh to make lower-tier foods important to the ecosystem and help reinvigorate various resources throughout the game.
---
Yesssssss, time for our own characters to also explore the culinary applications of bloodstone dust.
---
&gt; or push gemstore stuff even heavier than in the recent year.
---
Warframe and especially PoE using gemstore quite successfully. Ever seen support packs from PoE for 500 USD? Well, its working.

---
If you have a legendary it switches to the correct stats, if you don't it looks for the piece of gear with the best match and slots it.
---
What's the problem?
---
He didnt do it because he had no content. He said it was a passion project that he started YEARS ago but never finished.
---
It could conceivably pull from your bank, too.
---
My personal suspicion is that, rather than focusing on LW content and releasing new Fractals and Raids in parallel, ANet will use their new team structure to put out more focused releases with greater freqency - while this could lead to longer (or shorter, on occasion) waits between releases for any given type of content, it should help both the quality of a given release (by simple merit of having more people working on it) and the overall pace of a new content (three teams need to produce an update in six months to put one out every two, but four teams have eight to work with). It might also allow them to occasionally have one of the teams do something for PvP, WvW or one of the Festivals, but that's just speculation on my part. Time will tell how things actually end up working, but I'm feeling optimistic at this point.
---
Cosmetic mtx is a bit of an issue when your endgame is cosmetics. When the best skins you want are obtained by grinding gold to buy them off the shop. And when their art resources are spent on mtx items like outfits instead of creating rewards like armor sets for playing the game.
---
Sure. Except instead of it taking up bag space it gets added to this one item that can then do all of the things.
---
This is really high quality work for an april fools.
---
Nobody really knows, so why not just base your opinion of the game in the present.
---
&gt;After the cooking 500 update
---
Yes plz! Bring on the endless legendary food!  A bottle containing an endless supply of wine which you do not intoxicate!
---
Some *food for thought*, but this would be a great way to add in some more middle eastern folklore for Elona. Many cultures depict the afterlife with an endless river of wine.
---
&gt; Have you seen the earnings charts? No expansion in the next year(s) means declining income for Anet. Declining sharply. They'll realize they don't have anymore funds to continue building the story (do they even have such plans at all?), and will either start charging for each new LS episode, or push gemstore stuff even heavier than in the recent year. Personally I'd hate both possibilities. I'm all up for a one-time $30-50 payment for a big shiny expansion, but the same thing broken down into portions somehow feels eh. Also that'll break Anet's own rules regarding LS being free for all.
---
Considering how well they were doing while dumping money and other resources into other projects which didn't generate any revenue at all I would say this is unfounded.
---
and people are like "if u dont throw money at the game then you're the reason its dying" like yeah thats true to some extent but i dont want to throw pasta at the wall anymore. Gem store items are great if you like cosmetics but Anet knows they can't live off of 1 time purchases without getting younger audiences to start wasting their birthday money. I spent hundreds of dollars in this game for cosmetic items in high school. Now? I bought some mount skins, everything else on the gem store is worthless to me. i want to see guild wars 2, not Evon Gnashblade selling tyrian pop culture trends for the 400th week in a row
---
Who says they're in order?
---
It's more of a see that weird shit in the distance? That's where were headed. 
---
That would've been a beautifully cruel april fool's joke
---
I can happily throw money at expansion
---
i didn't even notice the sigil change. but thanks for the detailed explaination! :) 
---
thanks for the idea. will definitely look more into it, but with that price tag it will probably take a while to get.
---
Can we wait until they make a Season 5 specific blog post before jumping to conclusions? 
---
LS5 is unprecedented. This is the first time since expansions became a thing (2016) that an actual additional season replace one with the premise of providing us expansion-worthy features.
---
We don't know how it's going to be delivered. We don't know what kind of content we'll get. We don't know the scope and scale of LS5 episodes, they could be bigger, smaller, anything. It's also a safe assumption that before they made the decision of launching another season, they had been working behind the doors on (the now cut?) expansion 3, so most of it is likely going to be recycled in some way.
---
Anet is at the crossroad right now. It can go in so many different directions.
---
I'm in board with those who are bummed with the lack of a full-deal expansion package. HoT and PoF are the two things that hyped me the most, for weeks even. I also *love* being given tons of things at once (many weapon sets, armors, skins, elite, new toys, new gadgets, new guild halls, etc.). And I also feel the LS formula extremely repetitive.
---
**But** considering the unprecedented nature of LS5, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt... For now.
---
the 4th wall is broken
---
love the chair!!
---
Love it! I know it is the "fad" to hate on things, but I honestly think these are pretty nice, and considering the amount of them im seeing in game compared to other chairs, I think this is also popular with a lot of people! 
---
... really?
---
They just scrapped two of their future projects and lost over 100 staff members.
---
Guild Wars 2 is their ONLY relevant and active source of income right now. The well-being of the company rests SOLELY on this game doing great for the foreseeable future. 
---
They can either make proper content for it and continue to earn money from it, or they can turn it on life support and lose an insane amount of income as their playerbase migrates, causing NCSoft to step in and pull the plug. At which point Anet don't have anything, least of all a loyal fanbase. 
---
So what do you think it's going to be? 
---
Any sort of panic that they are nearly done with the game is absolutely ridiculous at this point. Mike Z has said there is a lot more to come, if you don't buy it from him, suit yourself. You do you. But at least don a big tinfoil hat. 
---
Yupp, certain
---
YEAH IM GOOD.
---
Thanks though lol
---
&gt; When the best skins you want are obtained by grinding gold
---
Just like every other skin apart form dungeons and raids.
---
I am so excited about this build templates for real not a joke OMGGURED I have taken a break from the game so many times come back hoping that this was on the horizon or going to happen suddenly without notice....  
---
Yes I leave the game and go play FFXIV then I get sick of monthly sub and come back and then I get sick of no build templates and leave again
---
Except together with cancelling projects ncsoft could cut fundings as well.
---
I think its good whenever you feel ready to buy. I think im in the minority but I do not like GW2 leveling and the expacs each give a free max boost. You can do all the content at max due to scaling anyway and then you unlock all your ability slots and start working on mysteries. Its not as fun playing with 1 utility slot and you cant swap weapons either. Also the HoT content is super fun so far even though im just starting it. 
---
Some things to do now that you're 80:
---
  
---
1) Work towards exotic gear. Since you're still f2p, I don't think you can buy it from the trading post, but you can craft it, buy it through dungeons, or earn it through certain PvP/WvW reward tracks. 
---
2) As soon as you decide that this IS a game you want to commit to, buy either of the expansions. You don't need to play them yet (and I wouldn't recommend it personally unless you play through the story chronologically including the S1 recap and playing S2), but you'll be able to access the trading post, masteries, and converting gold to gems in the gem store, which you'll need to buy S2 unless you want to spend real money on the gems.
---
3) Do your dailies every day. It gives you some easy structured goals to work towards, and you get 2g from it so it can help you save up money.
---
4) Check out a few different things in the game, like dungeons, fractals, world bosses, PvP, and WvW, to see what you like. 
---
5) Explore the map, and try out different meta events that you see - you might realize you find some of them really fun. Also, world exploration can be really cool in general, and map completion is a nice goal to work for, especially since you need it if you ever want to craft a legendary. 
---
6) When you're ready, watch the S1 recap (you can do this whenever tbh) and maybe google a summary (or watch the full unofficial 3 hour movie of it on youtube), then either tag along with someone playing S2 or buy it from the gem store and play it yourself, and then, story-wise, you're ready to start HoT. Chronologically, it goes personal story -&gt; S1 -&gt; S2 -&gt; HoT -&gt; S3 -&gt; PoF -&gt; S4.
---
7) Achievement hunting, training masteries (once you buy an expansion), making and gearing alts, getting good at the game mode &amp; class you like, and finding and trying out new things to play in the game to mix it up are all ways to go from here.
---
I don't know what you're trying to say.
---
just look at the earnings reports. they literally cannot afford another expansion with the profits they will make from season 5 unless A) the gemstore becomes even more flooded with things players wish were obtainable in game (this has killed every game that has done it in the past, see black desert, rift, swtor, bless..), or B) they will start charging money for each living world episode
---
I mean the build templates is great and all but what about actual content? new dungeons/fractals/raids/group finder? what about something different like a one boss raid kinda like ffxiv primals? difficulty modes? capes? Everything is just so stale atm and build templates is just a small QOL improvement.
---
Tangled Depth might be the most amazing map ever in such a game.
---
I'd love that kind of map some day in the future, maybe in the next expansion.
---
But for now, I would be really amazed with some overhauls for existing maps. Or if they would connect e.g. SW and DT and then try to turn them into something new as a whole.
---
&gt; and have accurately speculated that the long-requested feature of build templates is in the works
---
...and yet that didn't stop from the reddit community from actively downvoting and denouncing said astute players.
---
I usually advertise with Fractal I want to run as I need to get through a good few before I get to the last Fractal I need, so I'm 3 Fractals in from the very beginning at the moment, and I can't seem to find anyone willing to run the 4th with me, as I can't seem to pick and choose which Fractals I need I have to slog through the list until I hit the one I need for this legendary crafting thing.
---
T1, I'm three Fractals into the list
---
Quaggans please
---
I too think I've been hit with the few assholes of the game, as I do usually get some great members of the community helping me out in most areas not just in Fractals, this community is actually really really great.
---
Lol you're just being a massive asshat, that ban is justified ^^
---
Who cares, go make new twitch account.
---
Yeah, an rps or coin flip or dice roll would all serve the same purpose
---
That's how it was previously, but this update gives the impression that they are now operating as four unspecialised teams rather than each having a specific role. It also implies that any resources dedicated to new expansions have been split between the team, which is an interesting prospect (more manpower focused towards ongoing content is always a plus in my book) but could also have difficult long-term repercussions, as expansions are always a major source of income for an MMO.
---
That's not the point of the stream, it's not an AMA, they could get in trouble for responding incorrectly or at all. You being banned makes sense as this stream is intended for returning players to see what they've been missing, you throwing concerns about the state of the game is not going to encourage them to log back in.
---
I wonder why..
---
nice concept. 
---
the dev team hinted alot about under water content and largos in general.
---
proof: [GW2 devs hints about underwater content.](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
Agreed 100%
---
It’s more for coming in and just spamming the chat with negative questions. You are asking questions to simply try and get a rise out of people. I think most streamers don’t want some guy coming in and creating a negative experience for everyone by talking a bunch of shit about the game. If you don’t like it dude no one is forcing you to play guild wars 2 but at least let the people who do enjoy playing it have a good time. 
---
I can only tolerate doing the flax farm because of how short a time it takes me to go through my alts, wouldn't want to jump from toon to toon without the faster gathering speed.
---
Agreed, I would be very pleased to see some of the messier remnants of S1 cleaned up a bit (particularly in Kessex Hills), as well as perhaps some improvements to the more underwhelming LW maps like Kourma. New content in other existing maps would be nice as well (revamping some of the World Bosses or even adding new ones, for example), but they'll need to be careful to avoid repeating the mistakes of S1.
---
It's because of technical limits of gw2 and it's highly unlikely that it'll change in future
---
The thing is that players are really impatient with games that deliver nothing but gemstore content. Sure, that's how they already do finance themselves, but it only works for them and doesn't pull their reputation down because they generate free content updates, new maps, raids, etc. As soon as that falls away, all but the most staunch and stubborn fans will nope out of there. 
---
Either this game continues to deliver cheap/free meaningful content, or all the gemstore releases in the world will not carry the company beyond 2019 or 2020. 
---
I don't like the fact that we'll have another season instead of an expansion (of HoT quality). But that's nothing new, so the things which are new here are surely positive.
---
&gt; A) the gemstore becomes even more flooded with things players wish were obtainable in game (this has killed every game that has done it in the past, see black desert, rift, swtor, bless.
---
GW2 has been flooding the gem store with stuff players wish were obtainable in game since launch and its still not dead yet. Whenever moan about the gem store because they introduced a new shiny everybody wants, I just shrug, buy gems with gold and purchase it.
---
Yep. That is a good portion of the posts lately. It is getting old.
---
The the legendary crafting stuff it is easy to deal with. Just keep an eye on which are the t1 dailies. Then either join a group for them when the ones you need rolls around. 
---
You can get the stuff for legendary weapon crafting from t1s. I have never seen anyone care that much about t1s. The people that care about having experienced people and wanting quicker completion will usually post their ads in the t4 section so you won't even be able to see those people's ads.
---
&gt; I've managed to get to get 3 Fractals in and have pretty much hit a roadblock where no one wants to go any further, is there anyone who can point me in the right direction for doing this? I wish they had a solo mode.
---
Well that is basically unnecessary since you can join groups for them. You only need to have the unlocks if you want to start groups for them and even then you can start a group and specify that you need someone else to open.
---
&gt;Focus on horizontal progression instead of vertical
---
And the game will continue to suffer because of it.
---
Seems amazing, love it
---
"I don't want to be a doomsayer." Ok.
---
Oh sorry about spoiling the surprise. Someone in game linked that and I made a topic here about it which promptly got poofed. I am assuming it was spoilers. Sorry.
---
Just give me a new legendary weapon pls 
---
This is an appropriate place to ask, did they ever expand underwater exploration or levels or anything?
---
I haven't played since before the first expansion, and the state of underwater always seemed like such a tragic waste to me. 
---
Hopefully more competent, PvE focused staffing for that skeleton crew of the Skills and Balancing team that has been pushing out these past joke patches that for some reason take 4-5 months to come out but barely touch anything in any meaningful way.
---
Maybe a new class?
---
&gt; We’re also talking about different types of reward structures for events.
---
In the context of WvW I don't know, but I really really wish they introduced reward tracks or currencies to reliable acquire extremely rare PvE drops (eg. Weapons of the Sunless, Wurmslayer armour).
---
I always hug the left wall while doing it. Makes avoiding the greens blobs easier. 
---
&gt;Nothing ever indicate this in the post and this idea of taking away from PvE to put resources
---
The part indicated was in the same paragraph, where they stated that they would not be releasing new maps.
---
&gt;is very selfish
---
I think that everyone's opinion on game development are ultimately based in selfish opinions.
---
&gt;Really weird take you have.
---
I don't see why. I personally found that the announcement didn't promise to deliver anything geared towards my playstyle and did offer to reduce content for my playstyle. I don't see what that isn't something to not be excited about.
---
Ah, after reading a few of your reply, I can see where you coming from, you want to do progression fractals, this gonna be a bit annoying since most will only do fractals for the daily. But I would suggest you to lfg for something like 'fractals progression run', keep in mind that there will be people that join and won't stay for the full run.  
---
are you NA or EU? Which fractal do you actually need to do? 
---
Join a guild and ask for help
---
short answer yes.
---
long answer also yes.
---
Aw thank you so much!! &lt;3
---
As suggested, just wait for whatever fractal you need to be a T1 daily or recommended fractal. There will be lots of LFG that day. You don’t need to have the level unlocked as someone else will and can open it.

Lower tier fractal LFGs are simply a gateway to T4. If you consider how long the content is in the game it is no surprise that the T1-T3 LFGs are basicly dead. If you don't have friends/guildmembers who are willing to help you out I would suggest that you camp the LFG with a specific advertisement for the achievment you want to do... it will take time but it will eventually people will join.
---
On a sidenote: You do not need a full group to do fractals ... maybe 1-2 palyers is already enough for your purpose.
---
The groups I've seen aren't looking to do the Fractals I need, you say It's easy to get the crafting from the Fractals, but I'm having a hard time trying to find people willing to do those Fractals with me.
---
I'm finding groups left right and center, but these groups either - don't want an inexperienced Fractal runner or don't want to run the Fractals I want to run.
---
It doesn't seem to be as easy to "Just join a group" or "wait for the dailies" as you say
---
honestly, no need to advertise that you’re new unless you’re really having specific problems. you don’t really need to go through the fractals in order so joining the dailies to get your rank up should work fine as well. especially at t1 people shouldn’t care if you aren’t playing entirely perfectly
---
You don't have to follow my logic. By your logic I'm forced to play a different spec. That is a solution, though not really. As for Mirage being a roaming spec: I agree, but usually you can find other classes also doing that kinda better. (like maybe ... deadeye? Or daredevils?) I am sure I can still improve by learning to play better, though.
---
You do raise some ideas I personally find valid, though: If for example Anet could come up with a way for the mirrors to do something for the zerg, too, well, that could be interesting :)  
---
And yes, what I am complaining about is exactly that the mirage is kinda self-centered. It could be more, though. With the clones you can conjure up, combined with traits in the inspiration traitline for your illusions or clones to benefit the party, that could lead to something interesting if it only were somewhat stronger. Or the shatters benefitting the party ... if it only were somewhat stronger.
---
yeah okay um which reason is the actual one, users not allowed to facilitate their own thread for discussion of a certain topic from their specific angle, or users not allowed to share opinions that arent neutral or positive? Either one is disturbingly censorious, and shows a lack of confidence by the mods in this subs community.
---
Promise the moon, deliver cheap looking rocks....
---
All of this, is real and is going to happen...in my wet dreams tonight.
---
Grinding gold as an endgame activity isn't fun.
---
I think it's a given that every developer wants to see their game doing fine, thus being able to develop even more. 
---
&gt;unecessary drama posts 
---
like this one?
---
I'm been kinda leaning towards your number 2 for a while now, but I'm also of the mind that to give some long term hope to the game, anet has to put resources into another expansion and at least publicly state so sometime this year.  I also noticed in their financial reports their revenues seemed to perk up around the PoF expansion then gradually lessen.  Living Seasons (to me) don't seem like a sustainable business plan.  The problem with all this is timeline.  Imho, they should have shot for a Nov/Dec 2020 for another expansion.  Unless they can speed up LS5 by a little or cut an episode from it, AND have the resources to do an expansion, Dec 2020 can't happen for an expansion.  Now you are talking 2021 sometime.  I'm not sure the player base will take that or be a good draw for new players.
---
I would love the game to find a way to last for a long time but with what happened at anet recently I don't know.  Their revenues are still enough to support the game for a while, but to "keep" people playing long term is questionable without new and good expansion content that people are willing to spend money on.
---
The second idea seems most likely, imo. The first kind of seems redundant if you already have legendary gear, while the last (custom buffs) has too great a potential to be OP. The issue is, if it's "select one of many setups" the list will either be INSANELY long, or be very generic effects and thus not overall worthwhile.
---
I am a partner for another game/dev and it's pretty common we get material sent to us ahead of time for news stuff like this. It doesn't feel like much to be sent under NDA, sure, but that also minimizes the risk of damage from leaks. It's pretty common across other games and their dev/community teams as well from what I learned by talking to other people who are involved in these programs as well.

I just want to say that your dps isn't something you should prioritize over surviving, positioning the boss and outputting boons. If you're dealing only 300 dps and everything else is good, you're team will carry the rest of the dps. A proper 100% quickness/alacrity uptime on the group deals more group dps than whatever you're going to be able to min/max yourself.
---
Yeah it would be shitty if templates didn’t accomodate non-legendary gear
---
Ehh in every game I've played with build templates if a piece from your gear isn't in your bag it just doesn't get equipped, so if you get an upgraded chest piece and salvage the old one it just leaves your new one equipped
---
&gt;teams dedicated to supporting the core game like Skills and Balance, Rewards, WvW, and sPvP. 
---
This gets my steam going!
---
We get them fabled road map people clamored for and most of you are still doubling hard on "This game's SO going to die"
---
I actually really liked the Season 3 maps, it felt refreshing to travel all across Tyria, getting updated on the going-ons of different locales while we continued the story (Ring of Fire and Orr for example). The only maps I felt kinda 'eh' towards were Bitterfrost Frontier (mostly because The Bitter Cold is disappointing, shoulda had another Claw of Jormag fight, Death-Branded Shatterer style), and Draconis Mons because it's an absolute nightmare to navigate.
---
All I can think is how they could expand Caledon Forest into the Dominion of Winds and now I'm getting so fucking hype.
---
Named armor is part of the accessible to F2P TP.
---
Or what about headphones? Are you able to jam out to some Jeremy Soule with some buds in your ear hole? 
---
fuck off

---
You can't hit the oil with scepter normal attacks, use the symbol and ask your groups weaver/tempest to switch to staff.
---
Other dps classes are better suited to destroy those oil barrels.
---
On my Chrono I switch for damage wells / ult and greatsword to destroy them quicker..., if your group knows what they're doing you can get rid of them fast but usually in pugs they don't know mechanics so just use a second scepter 2 aoe. Sadly you can't do much as guardian - You need ground targeted AoEs!
---
I'm so confused?
---
Now you're acting hostile without any evidence at all.  Lol.
---
You still need at least 3 teams working on ls releases (at least until the end of s5) to keep up with the release schedule. Unless they'll change the formula again for s5 and go back to s2 way of content which I doubt. I don't really see anything changing for the next 1.5-2 years, except the quality and polish of the releases (assuming the company is dedicating resources back to gw2 - if they're not too restricted due to layoffs and probable internal talks of the next expansion). 
---
My wish for the instanced content isn't about hardcore wow-style raiding. Dungeons would be a perfect candidate to keep the playerbase, both casual and semi-hardcore, invested in the game. Fractals/raids are a whole different topic to talk about. As much as I like the design and art of the new maps they don't offer any real replayability. 
---
At least season 1 kept the core maps alive/fresh and dungeons had the potential to do the rest. Now we're stuck with a weird formula that doesn't quite work for me. 
---
it would be interesting if they did have ascended versions, just because i'm curious to see how they'd do that without unbalancing everything.  however it's def not needed. 
---
I was a hard core fan when the game was just a twinkle in anyone's eyes. Rewatching class videos and spending way too much money in the game.
---
What is this in reference to? Were they fired or did someone pass away?
---
Also make sure to update the current ticket as needed instead of creating new tickets because otherwise it takes longer to process.

If LWS was unprofitable they would not exist. They sell gemstore stuff, people buy gemstore stuff.

If you're after only meta events, then the heart of thorns meets events are still the most populated.

Since you've left, though,  I'd also check out the new raids and fractals. 
---
&gt; gemstore additions without feeling like they would be taking content away from the main game?

This just shows basically what the base drops rates are without magic find. Pure drops if you will. If you look at the %s then apply 947% magic find, you'll see the resulting %s are pretty similar to the gear results I had. You can do this with any magic find % to see what the expected results are.
---
As far as I can see, they removed your posts with a good reason: unnecessary drama. They're not trying to play god. They're not causing drama. You cause drama and then even more drama because your first drama was removed (rightfully so)
---
Very interesting! Thank you for sharing 
---
if LWS updates were *reasonably* profitable, the expansions would not exist. I said in another thread that the gem store is life support for the game, but the gem store is really life support for the devs. LW in its traditional implementation has been life support for the game in between expansions. I think the future of this game will be certain once the implementation of season 5 is revealed.
---
For a second I thought it was real =)
---
regional mount skins, regional glider skins, regional outfits, cultural armor(the line so overstepped it had to be reverted). I could go on if I thought hard and long enough to remember them all.
---
so the ~1000% magic finds loss translates into -90% loot value outcome
---
really , no POF events at all ?  , ok i guess , thanks
---
you can just purchase gems with gold you earn from playing the main game.
---
They caned mobile projects because they already have other studios working them.
---
They figured anet should focus on GW2 and cut costs via removing people doing other crap
---
It's large enough that it doesn't look strange on my max sized male charr engi.
---
They canned background projects, yes. Most or all of them mobile? Most likely. Focusing 100% on gw2? Never confirmed. Also they can just be working on wrapping the game with season 5 and going into maintanance. Current flow of devs supporting the game may be only there to finish outgoing projects for gw2, like alliances, which are long overdue.
---
You can assume both good and bad from current situation. The fact that anet said nothing about if anything comes after season 5 is pretty telling to me.
---
I don't think Anet would be that basic on the mounts, but i do like the water themed elite spec icons
---
People do t1-3 for the daily recs because those are required for the pages.
---
Since floating point numbers are approximations with a fixed number of bits, converting any decimal number into its bitwise representation eventually involves, at the least significant bit, rounding to the nearest bit. You don't even need to enter infinite nines, the value will become 1.0 as soon as you get to a certain number of nines, often around 9 or 17 or so (depending on the floating point precision). Because of the approximating nature of floating point math, not only is 0.999... exactly equal to 1.0 in your computer, but 0.999999999999999999999999218 is also equal to 1.0!
---
But they're all just ideas concerning live game content (WvW, PvP, crafting) that isn't comparable to announcing a new expansion for 2021.
---
Wow! That's rather tragic. Wholesome but tragic.
---
admits mistake, gets called simple lul 
---
If anyone on NA ever wants help with fractals for a collection.l just let me know.  I'm down to casually low man them until we get to the mini boss or boss then edit the LFG for free loot.  
---
Raids.
---
as much as people called immersion breaking on the SAB glider, it was the first one i spent real money on too. Its just so charming and they put some work in
---
They did updates to underwater combat, and added ascended aquabreathers, which gave off the sense of "more to come", but we've not yet seen more.
---
Can I just point out Anet went from 2012 to 2015 without an expansion and the game was fine.
---
This is right. Personally I suspect they don't have an expansion planned, but they have never explicitly said that, so anyone who says it's confirmed is jumping the gun.
---
Stumbled upon this on the top page, this game was my favorite childhood game glad to see its still alive
---
the elite icons really have me intrigued. Any chance you gonna expand on them? 
---
Despite the pr fluff that we got earlier today, nothing is gonna change, we're still getting the same old living world episodes (tho slower than before) and most likely still random gemstore items that people seem to buy enough of to get the game going. I know people are up and about cause we got an actual semi informative post by the big guy himself (probably?) but in reality it's just fluff to keep people from spreading too much 🦀 gw2 is dead🦀 drama which scares away potential players :/ 
---
&gt; Guys, the four teams can very well include an expansion team.
---
At this point after HoT we knew expac3 team exists. We have no such confirmation today. And considering how much time Zadorojny spends on hyping up living world in every interview he's in (and even 66% of todays "roadmap" is affirmation that LW is Jesus 2.0), I strongly believe they have no plans for expac3
---
:D
---
ITS A SPACE MARINE JUMP PACK!!  halloween costume contest w/ my guild will be awesome this year.
---
Idk stopped trying to understand this game since HoT.
---
Perhaps you could provide me with examples of actual HEALER classes who are not tanky asf and were built and designed to support the team.
---
This is what I use too.  Unbound logging and axe, and Consortium sickle, all with Volatile Magic runes.
---
so you want healer or support? or both?
---
Damn. I bought the Ironclad glider for my Iron Legion Charr but this would have been so much better.
---
we have Koss now
---
Did take 7 years for you to realize that the two games are very different?
---
Do Charr still do the Superman pose when using the jetpack?
---
tl/dr:
---
op wants expansion
---
And Koss on Koss.
---
An actual healer that serves his purpose as supporting the team HP-wise as well as providing buffs , a Healer or backline if you prefer
---
Maybe because they won't copy all GW1 weapons (only to have it ingame)?
---
And tbh, they adepted very much GW1 stuff. 
---
Since it seems like we are leaving the Elonian area now, you have to wait a "bit" longer. However, iIrc MikeZ's last statement was, that they are not against new weapons. So a new elite spec with a new weapon -&gt; Scythe is still possible. But don't expect a 1:1 copy from GW1, no GW2 class is a GW1 copy. 
---
Also your healing class, two things on this. 
---
1.) Actually the monk is already in the game, but spread over the existing classes. Mostly Guardian, but also Warrior using Monk skills.
---
2.) A real healing class and you say "not Druid". Tbh is probably the worst healing class, if it comes to heal. It's meta in PvE, because of all the dmg buffs and because the heal is still enough, even for raids.
---
However, if you want a healing class, that's not Druid, you can play Tempest, you can play Scrapper, you can play Renegade, you can play Firebrand. All of them providing way more heal than Druid. 
---
In the end you should accept, that GW2 is GW2 and not GW1 2.0
---
i do but thats not what this thread is about, stop following me lol
---
This is abstract thing to consider, because the universe, artificial or not, is endless.
---
Star Wars to this day is not explored entirely.
---
Middleearth, even with Tolkiens magnificent world building, still has never told stories or places for you to never see.
---
So, answering your question, it's not breaking NDA to say this about GW2, because there is always room for expanding existing world.
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...
---
Buut due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). We have plenty of experienced heroes of different classes there that can guide you to the right direction.
---
Alternatively please check out this [class guide](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:What_Profession_Should_I_Play).
---
If you think your thread should be allowed to stay or if this was a mistake do report this comment or send a modmail and Pact commander will come take a look.
---
I would buy this today! I love the Largos and it would be a great expansion idea, and as this is a stand alone race there would be no reason to have a personal story tied into the old one. Well done, add underwater jousting and i'm all over it!!!
---
Yeah, because GW1 was good only because of the Monk, the Bone Dragon Staff and the Obsidian armor. Hilarious.
---
I am a new player, do you suggest spend time in Super Adventure Box? I am interested in earning gold or get a ascended gear.Can i do something lucrative in this event?
---
Is the [Regeneration](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Regeneration) boon affected by traits or effects that increase outgoing healing?
---
Its stated that it prefers the highest healingpower available and since my Guard has about 1500 I'm sure my Regeneration is allways the active one!
---
But I'm curious if food like [Delicious Rice Balls](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Delicious_Rice_Ball), utilitys like [Bountiful Maintenance Oil](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bountiful_Maintenance_Oil) or traits like [Force of Will](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Force_of_Will) push that healing value even further...
---
So you want buffer/healer hybrid. There are multiple builds filling this role that you can find on build related sites for endgame content. And I believe most of them aren't tanky. Even the druid isn't tanky at all.
---
Well we don't get the option to get stick back after getting nunchucks, and this is for a good reason. The nunchuck is an overall better weapon. Boomerang just needs to be balanced like nunchuck, and be overall better than whip. The bombs are different because they have an element of cost effectiveness for -1 baubles vs. -5 baubles for double damage.
---
THey're going to need a chunk of money from NCSoft for that, but NCSoft wants to see changes at ANet going forward to support the game first. Give it time.
---
So they finally tell us we will get templates we been asking about for over 6 years. We begged, we yelled, we cried, we threaten, we did it all and today we get the word that it will come. 
---
And what do you do? You instantly find something to moan about....
---
*facepalm*
---
Contribute in the ways that are available, imo. Their cash shop will only really charge for cosmetics and QoL stuff.
---
&gt; [Monks](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Monk) employ a direct conduit to the gods, and the answers to their prayers come in the form of **healing** and **protection** for their allies and **damage** to their enemies. Combined with any other profession, Monks can alternate between supporting their party and dealing damage to opponents. Monks enjoy Divine Favor, which provides extra healing power, while their healing and Protection Prayers help to keep their allies strong and healthy. Smiting Prayers, on the other hand, call down divine anger on enemies, exacting holy damage that ignores armor, though **damage-dealing is not the Monk’s specialty.** What Monks lack in firepower they make up for with their unparalleled gift for keeping their allies alive.
---
current meta Druid build: 
---
- Heals
---
- Protection (reduces damage taken)
---
- Might (increases damage) &amp; [Glyph of Empowerment](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_of_Empowerment)
---
- Damage dealing is not not the Druid's Specialty
---
you're being willfully ignorant, which is fine. 
---
Yea I agree with you about the living world seasons. It's sooo lame that it's time gated. 
---
They'll probably get the cash to develop one when NCSoft sees them dedicated to improving the game.
---
Realistically, we probably won't start hearing about an expansion until 2020. Since Season 5 will last through the end of 2020 if they keep with the 6 episode releases.
---
and [Koss on Koss (Extended Edition)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Koss_on_Koss_(Extended_Edition\))
---
I suspect that if NCSoft sees the game being turned around by the redeveloped work on it (as they are hoping will happen), they might punt some expansion funds to ANet.
---
Legendary consumable waiting room...
---
&gt;you should be playing a different game.
---
I am.
---
I won't be playing GW2 again any time soon, horizontal progression in an MMO is the worst thing possible for character and personal progression.
---
They have announced working on build templates multiple times already in the few YEARS...this is nothing new. People are forgetting the, will "ship when it is ready" which usually means not anytime soon ;3
---
or ....  
---
Yakslapper
---
You will lift the restrictions and start getting daily log in rewards which could be worth it for you or not. Only you know this. 
---
Anyone who would open a statement like that has my respect and money. 
---
if the armor has no lore associated with it I don't think it's **content**
---
I like the idea of re-tuning and finally maxing out cooking finally.  Definitely a lot of foods that have no use, etc.  So would be nice to see.
---
Looking forward to build templates one day though.
---
Not sure how I feel about Legendary Signets/Runes.  Seems kind of unnecessary.  But honestly I guess a lot of people need something else like that to work towards.  Probably will also have some fancy effect tied to them.
---
In your opinion.
---
Lots of staff got laid off =(
---
https://youtu.be/wsOXvQn3JuE
---
I can do it, so should youuuuu
---
If this were real, I would've pre-ordered this even if it meant giving my last dollar. Still got my fingers crossed for some underwater stuff, even if it is small additions.
---
Thief. Some Achievements are done super easily with Perma stealth. Also easy class for World Completion if you need to nab an extra Legendary or 2.
---
Sounds like a great tip, thanks very much.
---
To the ground, it is to provide boons and some dps (at least more than the tanker and druids), in some encounters like dhuum offchronos do mechanics that needs to leave the group because they are the lowest dps. But you can check on snowcrows chrono guide they have a really in deep guide of each encounter.
---
I want a title for collecting them all like "runecrafter" or something else.
---
I am more concerned that 16 people downvoted me because i don't like underwater things in gw2. I guess people don't wanna hear others opinions. Whatever
---
I haven't been playing for several months. But oddly, this feature will get me back. Being able to casually play but change my play style to match the type of questing I'm doing that day significantly reduces barriers to playing the game. Love it.
---
If you do everything perfectly, 50% boon duration is enough to get 100% uptime if both chronos are doing things correctly. However, in most raids this is not the case and you will often have to move/do other mechanics. You may place your wells down on the wrong spot and have to move off. 
---
For a starting Chrono, I'd get full diviners armor, and weapons with Sigil of Concentration and Rune of the Pack. This alone puts you at 64.5% boon duration without trinkets or food. Since ascended trinkets are easier to come by, you can just round out your build with those. This allows you to adjust your toughness on the fly easily.
---
The absolute toughness to be certain no shenanigans will happen in regular play is 1550. This happens when a support firebrand (who hopefully is running harriers or diviners and not memestrils) has quickness and casts Epilogue: Unbroken Lines (F3 tomb 5 skill) and somehow doesn't hit you, which would put the firebrand at 1550. But hopefully this will never happen. I think that 1300 is the safest minimum.
---
Other ways individual classes can increase their toughness are as follows:
---
Any firebrand with quickness has a minimum of 1250 toughness from imbued haste
---
It's deimos and your oil kiter druid is running signet of stone for 1180 toughness.
---
You have a healer revenant running Salvation, who has a minimum toughness of 1120. Alternatively condi renegade using Embrace the Darkness will be at 1100 toughness. If you have a revenant with both embrace the darkness and salvation, it will be at 1232 toughness. I can see absolutely no reason to do this unless they're trying some really silly Sloth strategy.
---
You have power weaver attuned to earth has a minimum of 1120. If for some reason your weaver is taking Earth specialization (condi weaver), they will have a minimum toughness of 1270 (elemental polyphony + stone flesh) when attuned to earth.
---
This minimum can be met with full diviners weapons/armor with pack runes, sigil of concentration and full commanders trinkets. This will put you at 85% boon duration before food and 1308 toughness. It also gives you plenty of precision to make up for diviner's slightly less precision. 
---
If you want more toughness, you can run minstrel accessories to go up to the same boon duration but 1581 toughness, which is high enough to beat anything normal. This is a good setup for Deimos because hand kiters typically like taking a little bit of minstrels for security. 
---
Note that 85% boon duration + 150 AR will put you at 100% boon duration in fractals, so these builds would work there too. However in fractals, since you can get away with it, you'd just want to run mostly berserker trinkets.
---
You want the game to be finished without a single loose end?
---
Is that where you live?
---
First comic to have the exact same message no matter what order the panels are read/arranged in?
---
i really hope that people will not hate on them when they are´nt releasing some of the announced things after months or scrap them because thats is  what it is going to take minimum for the content of the last paragraph to be released. This is the communication that we always wanted lets not spoil it.
---
Do world completion. It will take you at least 2-3 weeks if you do 2-3 maps per day.
---
Heyooo!
---
So I read that base GW 2 is now free to play, with some limitations.
---
Fair enough!
---
Are these limitations removed if I purchase Heart of Thorns (something I'm thinking of doing) ?
---
Thanks for your time &lt;3
---
Edit : Oh, additionally - what is a good solo character \\ class to get to 80 ...maybe not "fast" but eh, efficiently?
---
The bit about the group needing to find a replacement isn't really on OP. He joined on Escort as a healer, presumably bc that was asked for on LFG, then he was asked to swap. Even if he left voluntarily before or after KC knowing he can't play Warrior well, they would've needed the replacement anyway and that's the comm's fault not OP's.
---
I also think that the "extra time" is being over-exaggerated a bit, waiting a minute to let them loot or type out a quick message isn't unreasonable imo. But I can sympathise with the comm, they have to deal with people being unreasonable constantly and there's only so much leeway you can give people before you stop caring about giving anyone leeway. Not saying that's right, but it is a reality.
