I feel like this would make a great series if you did a fly-through tour of each map like this
---
I can't even handle how funny that was.
---
Sure you can get through a zone in an hour that takes someone else 5 minutes to get through. Just because something doesnt' kill you doesn't mean there's no reason to use skills. Gold per hour comes to mind. Faster experience for leveling masteries, etc.
---
It would certainly be hard to do worse.

"Who's leading?"

*"I told you!  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune!  We're taking turns to act as a sort of executive-officer-for-the-week, but all the decisions of that officer have to be ratified at a special bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority, in the case of purely internal affairs, but by a two-thirds majority, in the case of more major..."*
---
I just go Ctrl + 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8 per mount.
---
Shift + 1 through 8. All but two are within reach of left hand, the warclaw and bunny get relegated to 7 and 8.
---
Hey everyone. I've come back to the game from about a year+ hiatus. I was looking to do some RIBA farming once more today, but noticed there weren't any group at all. Has this been worked out for something else? Or am I just not looking in the right spots in the party finder.

---
i think anyone that knows how to use the griffon doesn't say that (but nice riding/video). sidenote, it's somewhat misleading how none of this would be possible without grabbing a few unbound/volatile magic things to replenish the stamina. without those they would be right saying it "can't" fly.

You're free to disagree. I was at the point in Guild Wars 1 where nothing outside of the hardest end game content mattered at all, even hard mode didn't make a dent in my hero's ability to carry me through content. My wife and I beat DOA with six heroes, and we weren't such great players.
---
Beautiful üòç
---
I guess somebody said something mean on Twitter and they had to go to therapy on paid leave for a couple months? &gt;!/s!&lt;
---
&gt;and costs some gold which could seem like a lot to new players
---
Phht. I'm an old player and even I think the price for something only useful in getting a couple of mastery points is too steep.
---
They have already introduced having visual changes after certain story steps, they could make so the "rebranding" only appears after your character starts "Bound by Blood" or something, and I doubt they would replace all of Kralk's brand with it (as you said, some areas rely heavily on it's level of branding)
---
I wouldn't go by that criteria when I could theoretically ban a human player who was playing literally 24/7
---
Considering you hit max level in about four days, i hope that is a "you problem".
---
I'm not an expert, but I do know that you'll want to make sure you watch [Rheyo's guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0If9rtWUJ5o) and maybe the following [gameplay commentary.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07cgvPldsz0)
---
Yea but if you also already know and do your rotation, watch a video of the run on your role, you'll probably do fine in 3 runs or so.
---
Perhaps she inherited the resonance that Kralky had with all his crystals when she absorbed his powers and all branded structures changed to the Aurene version accordingly. Or maybe she did indeed fly over to rebrand, but I quite like the resonance idea.
---
As some comments say, I don't expect to see any change to old branded areas, maps are fixed (sadly) in time.
---
Lmao easy mode tbh, it's a big meme.
---
Looks like a normal NA fractal pug comp! 
---
Jokes aside, grats on the kill!
---
Yes, woodenpotatoes and jebto have
---
Why not, it's not like a person can manage that and account sharing is banable already. 
---
It's also easier to find a bot this way than go through piles of useless reports because some people report for botting almost every time they get tilted. It's more likely for a bot to have so much play time than a player.
---
&gt; Anet and and all their white knighting casual fans 
---
As someone that does both game modes, you're just as bad as a white knight because you're doing the same toxic bs with this post.  Enough already with the casual/raider hate ffs.
---
Whole PoF is easy mode tbh, including its meta.
---
Even dhuum CMs is a piece of cake, every time I see many groups fail at 10% it's literally all because they panic and lose their brain.for some reason. Literally run out early, freeze up, no protection or whatever else and just die.
---
Rifle war new meta. F1 for dps inc and cc
---
The gold is used to buy Mystic Coins which are then sold online :) with those you can bypass the limit of 500g
---
&gt; I would like to see footprints in the snow
---
It would be cool to have snowdrifts and high snow (correct words?). I mean we have several snow maps and it snows all the time, but everywhere the snow just covers the surface, but nothing more. I would like to see parts of the map where the snow is high enough to reach the hips (ears[Asura] | kneels[Norn]) including furrows where you walked.
---
We're League of Legends Worlds now.

Isn't it kind of ironic how a Reaper is demanding a META group he won't even be part of by definition ?
---
My right hand never comes off my mouse, so hotkeys that don't fit onto the 12 side buttons on the mouse have to be accessible to my left hand (F1-5 profession skills, ~weapon swap, 1-5 and QWERT skillbar, F interact, C mount skill 2, V dodge/mount skill 1, B special action button). The system I'm trialling right now is: 
---
A: raptor
---
S: Springer
---
D: jackal ("Dog")
---
G: Griffon
---
H: skyscale ("High")
---
J: warclaw
---
Z: skimmer
---
X: beetle
---
&gt;And this reason is why the legendary armor "happens to be ugly" while the gem store outfits look fabulous.
---
and this is why ill never get into gw2. For a game that gets titled fashion wars, the stuff you can actually earn by playing looks completly shit, and i dont want to nolife grind gold to buy stuff with gold-&gt;gem in the store either
---
Remember how they explicitly confirmed Season 1's way of doing things wasn't actually that great for the long term, /u/CHYmanko ?
---
Guess not.
---
Besides Lion's Arch, Season 1 didn't even change that much. It added stuff, changed a few minor events and area where not much was happening. That's substantially less than the suggested conversion of the Charr starting area that gives new players a distinct impression of the Charr's ongoing wars and recent history.
---
I would love to be able to select if a new character starts with them or has to unlock them again.
---
&gt; its essentially become a buy to play game the same as gw2.
---
most players will never make enough gold to finance their sub, thats the whole reason the model even works
---
True
---
Actually there is a little influx of Br players. But is not a great one. I said this because i saw more Br.guilds than usual at pvp and some events this couple of weeks.
---
It is random each day. You have to look for her each day until you get lucky with the RNG.
---
She only changes locations once a week. The best way to handle her is park an alt next to her for the week, log in and check her every day. Assuming you have an alt that can get to her anyway. It's pretty fast and efficient.
---
It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
---
sigh...i was really hoping i was just being an idiot and there was something i was missing. Oh well thank you for the info
---
Workaround: craft the acsended armor pieces you need with some other stats and throw them in the mystic forge + 5 Ectos + anthology of heroes + harrier insignia (exotic) = harrier (whatever you need) armor piece
---
Exactly. It's for RMT.
---
I still have a few "bunker" armor sets on certain toons "for WvW", but I found I'm bad enough that they don't keep me alive any longer; if someone who knows what they're doing wants me dead, I'm going to die, and my bunker gear will have just made me do less damage before my death. Those armor sets are really just for Fashion Wars purposes now.
---
Damn facebook lol gotta enter some code over and over then it won‚Äôt let me see unless I sign up
---
Ahhh, I'm sad that they seem to have stopped those adventures. I hated them at first (cause I was trash at griffon). 
---
But went on a learning/golding spree a while back. Getting gold on every one teaches you alllll about griffon handling. 
---
Now I love the griffon. 
---
But still use Skyscale 95% of the time.
---
...after all this years its the first I've heard of this... Jesus Christ
---
Something like [this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PKwAceFlRwWYXsJmJO0WWtKA-zxQYhog7cHZIsCJwMo0QoiCwzLSYsHeLjaGB-e)?
---
Basically it's your standard full zerk raid build with some might gain and a little extra precision thrown in. Pretty easy to switch it into the raid build seen [here](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/berserker/power/) if you ever find need to do group content. In open world stuff you'll be fairly squishy, but you'll kill stuff real fast and it's pretty easy to play, just get into rage mode, F1, healing skill, F1, spam attacks, F1 whenever you can, Headbutt into Outrage to extend the duration.
---
Good luck!
---
For revenant to be finished (1 more core traitline/legend)
---
Missing skills added to professions (heal/elite etc)
---
Gritlock and Rogan.
---
&gt;I was amazed with the asura animations
---
I still am.  Other MMOs suck because they don't have jumprolling Asura.  True story.
---
Has anything changed with WvW?
---
3rd especs
---
Imagine people paying for alt accounts just to implement the AI to populate unpopular game mode, so you as a dev don't have to. Would you ban them?
---
Everyone knows Quaggan are *master race*
---
Rip souffle BGH
---
Conditions are calculated and proc'd on a per second basis. So if you have say... 4.7 seconds of a condition, what actually happens is 5 packets of damage. Four 1 second packets and then a 5th 1 second packet that is worth 0.7 seconds.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Resistance will only negate the -33% less effective if all packets of healing are occurring within the time resistance is active. Additionally, poison affects incoming healing not outgoing. That is, Healer having poison does not affect their healing output. However, a healer stacks up a stat called outgoing healing % which was originally called Benevolence. Therefore a healer actually heals themselves LESS than healing others.
---
Z Skyscale 
---
F12 Griffon
---
Doh! I play with a TKL mechanical keyboard. But thanks!
---
Quaggan new playable race confirmed.
---
&gt; footprints in the snow, wet armor, armor with blood stain, moving hair. 
---
I thought you said realistic.
---
Didn't the peeps from City of Heroes said exactly the same thing a couple months prior to NCSoft plugging them off?
---
:( unlucky
---
FFXIV has Easy mode for raids and do you see the game declining? If any it's the most successful MMO in years.
---
Same
---
Your character does not have a drop of blood if she/he is attacked. Your armor is still dry if you enter the water.
---
What did you expected?
---
I think the mystic forge events were beta testing for the legendary runes and sigils event.
---
Good old locked and logan.
---
Realistic to this game mate, you know perfectly well they won't do any of those things.
---
This still proves that you can only go slightly higher than your initial height.  You're just resetting your initial height to be a bit higher every minute using the extra stamina from the skill.  So while you technically cannot gain infinite height, you can skirt your way around that with the extra skills.
---
Num 1-8 in the order I got them and Skyscale is my default x mount.
---
Ability to lock repeatable hearts as complete. Maybe for spirit shards?
---
It's not corruption....it's co-operation.
---
Always at Gandara home border.

Also was fun ^^

More white with gold accents. My loosely aspen-themed revenant. The full look is built around the Luminate's Backplate (and yes, I would love to have gotten hold of the Exalted shoulders, and will be saving pity tokens for the next time they show up on the vendor).
---
$$$
---
Not to mention how weird and confusing the maps still are for new player going through the personal story.
---
I remember entering Kessex Hills for the first time and just being *sooo* confused. There's season 1 *and* season 2 changes on that map.
---
I think new players are more confused when they find out about the old living story counter later, since in other mmorpg's there isn't a episode based story between expansions like in gw2. Normally you get the complete story with the expansions you buy.
---
Look at you with the sick burns ;) but I clearly presented arguments based on facts (ease of balance, accessible to all, devs interviews).
---
I cant wait to see what you do next! Will you discredit my facts because I lack quotes? Will you claim a bulk release is in fact easier to balance? Will you quote an upset pvp player about balance never being good anyways?
---
The suspense is killing me!
---
This is great, but really feel like we needed Danger Zone playing.
---
After that 10,000th piece of unidentified gear I wonder if they can even be considered a reward, especially since they are trying to throw them into all pieces of content.
---
Long hair options for men. I'm talking waist length or longer. Women already have them so we know it's not an issue of clipping or being unable to make them work.
---
You could see some of Aurene's new brand in the extended vehicle minigame teaser.
---
My post got removed because it contained name which made it "Witch Hunting".
---
I‚Äôve been saying this for a while. They need a bundle, which they should charge more for. It‚Äôs way too confusing for new players, and weird you can‚Äôt buy them all from the same storefront.
---
You're coming to an MMORPG for the story?! Sure it's gotten better over time, but this might be the worst type of game to focus on story. . .
---
Well the game is pretty well populated. Lots of people in starter zones. A new story release is coming out Tuesday. 
---
As for is it too late, this game may be the best MMO to catch up in, because expansions don't raise the level cap, nor do the introduce new tiers of gear. 
---
Actually you're right on time. Particularly because the old expansion was only recently included with purchase of the current expansion, so the game is cheaper than ever.
---
For a new player, right now, this game is a remarkable value.
---
I would only worry about LS2 and LS3, as those come before the expansion content and would impede people from playing in chronological order.  LS4 can be purchased after finishing PoF.
---
I can't tell, are you advocating for:  
---
A) Living World seasons to automatically be included with the expansions, at the current price. ($30)
---
B) Automatically be included, but at a higher price. (~$55)
---
C) Be offered as an add-on at checkout for about the same price as purchasing from the gem store. (+~$25)

---
For new players, even games like Wildstar at their worst will always be worth it, since they're new.
---
So one like GW2, yes, absolutely it's worth starting now.
---
Taimi and Braham you mean.
---
I don't know. LS 5 is going to be starting on Tuesday. Not sure what the point is in bundling everything that came before except the last thing, particularly if the idea is to be less confusing to new people. The more stuff you include, the less confusing it is. You know, pay this one price and get everything you can possibly get is just a better alternative in my opinion.
---
Omg did he stream this or put it on youtube? I wanna check it out
---
Lower price and set price.  If they bundle every episode up until whatever the current one is, the price would continue to go up.
---
I think they'd scare more customers away with an extra ~$10 for LS4 than they would confuse customers away by leaving it out.
---
Hopefully by the time players get to LS4 they would be comfortable with the content model.
---
Bots in GW2 PvP?? No way! /s
---
I'm not so sure. That is to say, optional content is optional.  Basically it's 7 years worth of content for what amounts too a pretty low price all up. If anyone is expecting to get 7 years of content for $50, they're fooling themselves. But even at full price right now, it's not much  more than that. It's not $100.  I don't think this is outrageous. 
---
There are probably enough people who will spend that giving it away event cheaper to the people that won't isn't necessarily good business.
---
  
---
At the very least, you start high and see what happens, because the one thing you can't do later with a game is raise the price.
---
C is probably a good idea, but I think B would be worse for the game and purchasers.
---
With C you aren't forced to buy content you don't care about, or still have the option to buy that content by earning gold.
---
I also think B would scare off more potential players with its higher base "entry fee".
---
Well, joining Wildstar right before it closed up shop probably wouldn't have been worth it...
---
But Guild Wars 2 is nowhere near that situation, it'll be going strong for a long time to come.
---
RNGesus, please watch over your child and comfort him, amen. üé≤
---
Sorry, my examples might not have been clear enough.  Assuming an add-on at checkout, I think Anet would price it ~$25 if it contained 2+3, but ~$35 if it contained 2-4.
---
If it also included every episode after that, they would need to raise the price ~$2 per new episode.  That might price change could confuse a customer that checks the price one week, then sees it is $2 more when they go to buy it a week later.
---
I think a not insignificant number of customers would:  
---
get to checkout with their $30 bundle, see the Deluxe and Ultimate editions for more money, then seeing *Experience the Whole Story* for +$35 and thinking, "This game is getting more expensive by the minute.  That costs more than both expansions."
---
I think +$25 would be less likely to trigger that response.  If they release another expansion that has story blocked by LS4/5 they should offer them as an add-on for that expansion.
---
This is how I made a lot of my Vipers pieces because Fulgrite farming is the pits
---
I deleted a raid mini I already had because I didn‚Äôt think I could do anything with it. Turns out you can trade them in for 40 magnetite shards even if you‚Äôre at the weekly 150 cap. Anyone ever asked support to restore an item like this?
---

---
Old epi bounce was the biggest meme of all lmaao. Loved it.
---
I¬¥m preparing a No death account, my goal is gonna be do mapcompletion+ascended crafting+Dungeon master+ raid archivements without death(Except VITV cause im not that insane), but i will have to be slipery with raids cause for those i will have to count with another players.
---
I have mine on Z/Y(depending on your keyboard), X and C + modifiers Shift/Alt.
---
(I also unbound the ‚Äöregular‚Äò mount up key.)
---
C - Raptor | Shift - Jackal | Alt - Warclaw
---
X - Skimmer | Shift - Springer | Alt - Beetle
---
Z/Y - Griffon | Shift - Skyscale
---
This still leaves room for one mount :)
---
The biggest change was the rise in scrappers with antitoxin rune.  Especially after the gyro change which made them much easier to play.  A lot of cele damage is mitigated because it's being turned into boons.  Power damage spikes much harder.
---
From Ky: 
---
i dunno how to give tips and i don't post on reddit so rip him  but general stuff that goes for all classes is stack as much damage as possible when the boss is broken to benefit from exposed 50% dmg mod -- on slb that's a minimum of popping sic 'em &amp; using axe 4 &amp; 5, and on top of that situationally precasting ticking dmg like OWP &amp; frost trap &amp; barrage so it ticks for the duration of exposed &amp; sic 'em, and use high dmg skills like gs 2/5/2, f3, lb2, f1/f2 to "extend" your burst rotation so you're using high dmg skills for the full duration of the burn. during your downtime (sic em cd) there's not much you can do but try to play clean, don't interrupt your auto chains and use filler skills between them (see golem rotation). 
---
 in pugs you won't get nearly as fast phases or breaks so you have to do more of a golem rotation, though you can still do things like precasting barrage &amp; swapping to greatsword before fight starts, precasted frost trap, OWP at mistlock soon before starting fight and then pop it again since it stacks duration, and/or stance share OWP and swap to oppressive superiority just before fight starts. personally i play stance share almost everywhere because it generally leads to higher group dps, though i do precast it and swap to oppressive superiority on some short T4 bosses.  
---
ironically i don't really follow this advice at all in this siax kill, i blow axe 5 on an add and pop owp in p2 during my big dps downtime and spend half of p3 locked out of axe, haha. it's very much a rotation that's tailored to the specific kill, not something i'd do in pugs.  
---
goes without saying but when learning slb i found it really helpful to watch slb speedkill povs, especially Elu's, his rotations are probably more applicable to normal kills than mine. i might post daily povs at some point with less weird rotations than the speedkill povs.
---
F-keys for me (griffon also on middle mouse button) but F7 was too far, so skyscale ended up as ctrl+f, as that's easy enough for me to reach.
---
You playin the WP scrapper build? How‚Äôd I get this?
---
Its on yt somewhere :D
---
As a player who was in a raiding guild in WoW that got some server firsts and seconds back in WotLK and who doesn't raid at all in GW2, I'm looking forward to strike missions. Not because I think raids are too hard (I don't), but because they will be comparatively short. I won't need to commit to doing a raid for a couple hours at a time in order to learn a bunch of different fights and potentially wipe on a few of them a few times. I won't need to worry about finding a group that includes some one who knows the fights and is willing to teach. And I don't need to worry about showing up consistently.
---
It absolutely isn‚Äôt! The game is quite well populated, and with a new Saga right around the corner we can expect more veterans to come back. The game is surely not going to get shut down anytime soon. Plus, as others have pointed out, it will cost you only 30$ to get the complete experience, as opposed to 60$.
---
If you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to talk to me here or ingame: Kirrow.4237 I love helping new players in the game, so don‚Äôt be afraid to ask!
---
If you want exotic you can get fully stat selectable exotic armor from verdant brink
---
&gt; The idea is to keep it less confusing.
---
I think 2+3 would alleviate 90% of the confusion, with a lower risk of reduced sales.  (Especially if they could get the price down to only +$20.)  Players will learn about the Living World episode pricing system eventually.
---
&gt; I see a game, it's cheap I want to buy it I buy it.
---
The scenario I'm worried about:  
---
Someone with a limited gaming budget sees GW2 is only $30, so they decide to buy it.  See a deluxe edition for $55, and don't want to miss out on exclusive content so consider buying that.  See that with the Complete Story add-on is $90.  Now that the price is triple what they were expecting, they are second-guessing the whole thing.
---
With the current system, players might be confused but are already invested.  I think Anet would prefer that to possibly scaring them off before hand.
---
&gt; Not having Season 1 doesn't do anything to ease confusion either.
---
Yeah, we all agree this is the most confusing thing for new players.
---
Was trying it out yes. It was only slightly different than the one I was running before
---
I use the exact same setup. That or I might've snuck into your house and played on your computer when you were out. You have a nice desk btw.
---
Well there's always the old stand by:
---
Buy any 1 season of the living world $15. Buy any two seasons of the living world $25. Buy any three Seasons of the living world $35.  This will allow them to add when 5 is complete, but it allows people to see they're getting more by spending more.
---
The problem with only including 2-3 is that 2 mounts are included in 4 and a lot of people would prefer 2 mounts to anything in Season 2.
---
How‚Äôd u get the speed tho. Gimme the trick bru in a bit tired of mounts and just wanna take in the maps, but not be comically slow
---
I have no idea. I was running a S3 story instance and looked at the bar when I was getting ready to exit the instance. Just a bug, I'm sure.
---
So this is just my inability to use a Griffon, but how do you maintain boost in the turns? I feel like any time I turn or flap while boosting I drop the boost?
---
Not sure. I was just playing an instance normally and before I left it I noticed the swiftness
---
Y is the Griffon, Ctrl+X is Skyscale, X is whatever is chosen in the little klickable box and Numpad 1-8 are direct access to each of the mounts.
---
European Keyboard Layout.
---
I think dh prestacks as fb, might be enouph quick for 27s
---
Idk man, if I were to come into spvp, and my 1st game was with 3 bots and I lost because of it I'd be pissed.
---
When a game let bots play just to boost their numbers its just being sellouts and I really don't like it.
---
Always worth the shot, they usually restore items like that.
---
Since when? Mounts were added in as one of the last major changes and we expect the alliance rework eventually....
---
*"I can out-limp a centaur!"*
---
That was prob me. I just suck
---
Quaggans so obnoxiously cute i just want to club them.
---
Well at least they're nice enough to give Anet a pointer with their name. Seems that didn't quite tip them off yet though.
---
wow. they literally just call them that? lol
---
Thank you. I will have to try this. So it's a flap while in the dive? Must be what I was missing.
---
When you sent your ticket in game, you should take the time to submit another ticket over the main website.
---
Website tickets are usually resolved in under three days. And try in English, I think that tickets in other languages will take longer.
---
*sigh*
---
No, it doesn't. UO and DAoC peaked at 250.000 subscribers, EverQuest at 450.000. Both of them vastly more social MMOs than WoW could've ever been.
---
**What made WoW so great was the pull of its name, the amount of money Blizzard threw at it and that it was a hyper casual cuddle fest, opening it up to a overwhelmingly bigger audience than EQ or DAoC or UO could've ever hoped for.**
---
Goku &amp; Vegeta?  (was this supposed to be gw2 only?)
---
If you got an email confirming they received your request, they will get to you.
---
If not, check your junk mail, but there might've been an error and you'll need to resubmit your ticket.  Check your account for open tickets first, though.
---
Yes
---
QoL pass.
---
I used to to set up shop on my engi in that room. The flaming Mad Memoires backpiece (cast light around me that only I could see, so I didn't need a torch) + net turret + big bomb + rifle (jump shot to skip second half of dark room and rifle 4 to knock people off) = lots of dead enemies that couls barely see what got them.
---
Yes, you lose height while gliding. Let's say you dive bomb ten metres down, so you can pull back up ten metres and flap for another two metres. But you did glide for so long that you lost 40 metres height, so pulling back up 10 metres won't bring you back to the point where you started.
---
So in the end it's a down - up - down - up - down - up bunny hop.
---
Throw in some especially skilled hopping and some [Bond of Vigor] flapping and you can glide quite a bit before having to pull back up again to maintain height.
---
Just do tons of damage before siax gets to that skill in his rotation 4head
---
I wouldn't say Anet is actively allowing them to run rampant as; it's more like they're apathetic. sPvP is basically on life support and that's not because of the bots so, rather than dedicate manpower to moderate a dying gamemode, they should just reap the bare rewards from it. In any case, if you don't or haven't previously played spvp, there really isn't a reason to start now. 
---
The reality of the situation is that the spvp community is so small already and it's getting smaller and smaller. It's actually really odd considering people always laud gw2's combat mechanics, which I personally think is average, as interactive and engaging and don't play PvP.
---
Skyscale buffs, still not fixed xD
---
Awesome video, horrible music. Still worth the gold though :)
---
enter? Sure you can enter them on your own.
---
Completing the Dungeon depends on your own skill level and the dungeon itself though. There might be mechanics that you can't do solo or you can't overcome some mobs on your own.
---
There are people running dungeons solo, how well that works for you is a different story.
---
there is not enough time passed yet to call it "forgotten"
---
this sub and blowing things out of proportion.
---
Haha, nice kill!
---
Soon we will reach the point where alacrigade becomes obsolete because you can cast anything once only anyways :^)
---
Well, I get [this](https://coding.fribbtastic.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/dungeon.png) message when I go into the Dungeon Ascalonian Catacombs.
---
So yeah, it does work and I don't really know why you wouldn't. The window is not telling you to get more people from LFG but that you can. If there are no other things to be selected as Explorable or Story path then something else is blocking you? Though in 7 years of playing this game I never had any issues with any of my characters at least getting into story mode.
---
Yesterday I had a slightly similar thing
---
I had two minutes of crippled on me, after a fight had ended, and no conditions cleanse so I just had to wait until I could waypoint again
---
Hey, I never installed an addon for this game before, I don't see the  d3d9.dll file the instructions say I should drag into my gw2 file. I'm sure I'm missing something, any help?
---
I got small group but have no groups to play with :/
---
A pinch of freemium is this game's dirty little secret. You get it literally for free if you're there while it's active. But everyone else has to unlock it via gold or money.
---
I just wanted to say that this was a great read and and great content for this sub.  Thank you.
---
I'm not sure which leaderboard OP is referencing but I get matched with G3 being in P2, that's depressing af.
---
Do we need to play windowed like Taco to use this?
---
I honestly have no idea why Anet's videos are never posted on YT.
---
Why not a buzzfeed quiz smh
---
&gt; Mace for core engineer
---
I never knew I wanted this so much
---
that is what I thought at first too but look at 0:06 of the video there is no land in sight and the mountain ends in water, either the map is now 10x bigger or the lake is 10x bigger
---
Sorry, kinda offtopic, but how do PVP Bots work?
---
Exactly, LW should be free for everyone, or no one. Either make everyone pay, or stop punishing late players.
---
Yeah there is already animation, perhaps they‚Äôre not visible in lower settings?
---
Alternatively they could have a small visible effect for when a player is applied Bleeding that only procs when player didn't have Bleeding before. This is the case for most other conditions in the game.
---
It's shady as fuck, like an extra purchase you don't know you have to make until long after you already bought the base game.
---
You need to sacrifice your cats firstborn child. Or your little brother, both work.
---
I agree 100%
---
It's a player retention mechanic. Whether it's an agreeable mechanic is I suppose up for debate, but it's still substantially cheaper than, say, 6 months of your typical sub fee MMO (assuming a cost of 12.99/mo.)
---
I think the main failing here is not the system itself, but more how that system is communicated and presented. As is it blindsides new players unless they've researched it or have a friend telling them. It's not painfully expensive, but it feels nickle-and-dimey. It should definitely be an add-on option during purchase of an expansion.
---
Lol. I used pain absorbtion on a npc one time and got crippled for 30mins. So i doubled down to see how long i could get crippled for. 
---
By the 4 hr mark i realised i had no condi removal.
---
Switched chara came back. Still crippled lol. So i asked in map chat for somebody to come remove condi. And two really helpful players came to help.
---
But i couldnt resist trolling so i was dodging around and hobbling away from them for like 15 minutes before they got me. But the guy used save yourselves to get me and was stuck with like 3 n a half hours of crip xD
---
this game has life for years to come my dude, we are about to get a new expansion soon, and a lot of people is playing it.
---
They're not punishing late players, they're rewarding active players.
---
It's premium content that they give away for free for a limited time, similar to the paid DLC for ESO.
---
People might be misunderstanding the concept of this post lol, I think because they're just reading the title? 
---
More realistic lighting would be super cool imo. Lighting can make such a difference.
---
Why skyscale? You can stack that with a sigil that gives swiftness on kill.
---
No you can't.
---
You can only have 9 swiftness stacks at once. So with 100% boon duration and killing 9 enemies at once you would only get 360 secs of swiftness (9*40).
---
Eh, less time than I've been in real life, so w/e
---
Anatomically speaking, a centaur wouldn't last that long with a limp.
---
Guardian profession skill gives you permanent aegis while out of combat.
---
It's because of your f3
---
I didn't know I needed it until after I got it
---
Gosh golly I have been using it wrong all this time
---
Well I got over 500 spare fulgurite ATM but I did it for vipers, minstrel and harrier stuff too, to speed things up. Especially the pearls for mintstreal where annoying and expensive when I made the equipment.
---
To be fair, they're not completely hiding it as Season 2 is on the [checkout page](https://i.imgur.com/H6bKvIx.png) as a $16 add-on.
---
Anet themself love casuals to death and ignores everything else that ain‚Äôt brain dead open world content! and the gem store ofc.
---
I can barely complete normal runs in 10 minutes. Good job.
---
Have you done story mode on the character you want to enter with? The option to enter explorable is per character.
---
That's basically the Ultimate edition.  For $80 you get both expansions +PoF Deluxe perks and enough gems to buy Seasons 2-4 with 800 gems left over.
---
When I was completelt new I was certain "living world" is just how people refer to the hot/pof maps. I was disappointed
---
With the recent announcement, the game being free/cheaper. There is a lot of Latin Americans reaching the game.
---
Thanks for the appreciation, but sadly this Sub community enjoy to down vote topics that they don't agree on. This post recieved downvotes only cz they don't agree that statement.
---
what expantion are you talking about?!?!?! stop spreading lies!! there is no expantion coming for a long time
---
and they downvote you for not being positive even when the game is sinking.
---
My regular weapon hotkeys only go up to the number 2: 1, Alt+F, 2, Q, R.
---
That way I can reach them easily without trying to aim for 4 or 5.
---
So I have 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 all free for mounts.
---
* 3: Raptor
---
* 4: Springer
---
* 5: Skimmer
---
* 6: Jackal
---
* 7: Beetle
---
* 8: Warclaw
---
* ~: Griffon (I set Tilde to the generic "summon mount" and select Griffon in my UI. That way I can use Tilde for both Griffon in PvE and Warclaw in WvW.)
---
* Alt+~: Skyscale
---
I think they meant the 2 buffs on the bar that require you to kill mobs for the Skyscale achievement
---
Oh God, that second picture. Emo-Caithe. Thank God they didn't go with that.
---
Thanks for your advice!
---
Where can I find my account name? Is it my email address?
---
what do you mean ?
---
im happy they did... i love the fact they are plant people and not humanoid with plant armor.  
---
to be honest, i think its unique that no mmo have thought of.
---
Me and downed state
---

---
Also never forget [Requiem Caithe](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Caithe%27s_Requiem.jpg).
---
Presse y ingame top left corner u can see IT
---
I think there are a couple of potential problems with that:
---
First, Living World episodes can be purchased with gems, which can be purchased with gold. A player may not appreciate being charged up front for something they could earn via play.
---
Second, buying the expansions doesn't necessarily mean that the player hasn't been playing the base game, and hence they may already have some episodes unlocked without realising, aking a complete purchase a waste of money.
---
shes the last one, couldn't find a bigger pic.
---
dang i didn't know!  
---
was she almost converting to be nightmare ?
---
I used to call that the creepy room. i was so surprised to see it in living world years later like that lol.
---
Rebranded mounts,gliders,wings, chairs coming to gemstore near you.
---
I was aware that they did that for the in-game store - does it also work for the website?
---
They don't sell the living world on the website at this time, so there's no way to know how it would be implemented.
---
Missing the salt and memes to be a proper wvw quiz.
---
I thought they sold Season 2 as an optional add-on (per a comment elsewhere on this thread)?
---
If they do I've never seen it and had no knowledge of it.
---
I prefer the concept art
---
Every time I see this discussion, I see people bring it up. But, holy hell is it so unfair to new players. Especially since they don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre not getting a huge amount of content when they buy the game. I find it disgusting, but a lot of people seem to disagree. 
---
Fortunately I have them all, but I can imagine how upset a person would be after they realized that they can‚Äôt get certain items, or even mounts, without forking over even MORE money. Alls because they weren‚Äôt playing the game when they were released.
---
What is there to do if you dont have gear to grind or leveling to do?
---
Power reaper on CA, pog combination
---
You can get around 8 levels per TD/AB/1 adventure sequence at the moment. Bloodbound weapons wouldn't help at all as at level 20 your contributions are limited to stomping shrooms, armor duties etc., then a bit of might and boons/buffs and if some person goes down you can res them. And feel a little guilty for scaling up the meta. ^^
---
She looks ridiculous now.
---
And i have seen a lot.
---
Like i saied, the time after Pof launch this shit was spammed a lot
---
‚ÄúThey have to make money somehow.‚Äù Oh come on. You can literally buy gold with real life money. I know at least 6 people in my guild who do this. 6! This is just scrapping he bottom of the barrel by playing on new player‚Äôs ignorance.
---
Caithe and Faolain! &lt;3 
---
... 
---
Oh, wait.
---
Woah! This is official art or maybe you know the author?? I'l like to see more pictures of that style.
---
We learned from the best ;\*
---
I'm okay with that. I loved the game, he wife did too, but we've watch it fall and fall because of bad management, loot boxes and mount skins.
---
GW2Hook still works? I think its not work with d912pxy, because that I didnt use anymore.
---
you can share you preset settings?
---
I‚Äôve been spotted.
---
its not low resolution  
---
its because the filter "artistic", kind of painting/draw thing.  
---
the settings are on high/medium/low (shadow only)
---

---
üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ Yes! So fabulous!
---
They are worth IMO. Before one weapon cost 250 Provisioner Tokens! Now they cost only 10 each!
---
I.. just don't like loot in this game anymore, lol.  I arbitrarily delete quite a bit of it because I'm not willing to trash or refine various mithril, silk, linen, metals and all that ...
---
&gt; How you could possibly stick up for this type of tactic. ...Shits disgusting.
---
When did charging for content become disgusting?  If this was a traditional single-player RPG like Dragon Age or Mass Effect, $2 per episode would be reasonable.  It is pretty consumer friendly that they give it away for free at all.
---
That concept Art is awesome
---
I just have 12 buttons on mouse . Ez

---
But they are optional. You don't need them to do the story and the expansions.
---
[deleted]
---
What about story? Is it good?
---
The buff re-applies itself every few seconds, so that wouldn't happen.
---
I wish people would stop spreading the rumor that dungeons are bad gold or worse gold than pre-hot. It's just not true. If this is what you're saying, you're helping to perpetuate a myth that keeps people from running dungeons for no good reason.
---
The only thing you can say along those lines that is true is that Fractals is better gold per hour than dungeons right now, but the dungeon reward was nerfed when HOT came out and changed after to be at least a profitable as it was pre hot. 
---
You can't run the same dungeon path over and over for that profit, but I don't see that as a bad thing.
---
My roller beetle has that as well
---
You can try it for free, f2p account grants access to everything that was in GW from 2012 to 2015, then You have to buy 2 dlcs (really cheap on sales). In my opinion lvling to 80 is pretty boring (but it's also not that long), but the rest of the game is fun. I played WoW since start to first month of Cata and it was opposite, I loved lvling in WoW, but endgame was boring.
---
I will try it, this and ESO as well.
---
The story varies quite a lot. The personal story is the least liked and, in my mind, the least understood story of the lot. It gets better as it goes on. Certainly the delivery method of the first story is the most primitive, and that gets a lot better.
---
The personal story is more like a tapestry than a linear story with different races contributing to the final outcome in different ways. There are so many permutations of ways you can play to see various elements of it, that you have to run it on different characters many times to really piece to together. It's a lot better when you do that and most people never will.
---
There's a lot to be said for later stories, but obviously every one is going to have a different opinion. I like the story. YMMV.
---
Okay thank you.
---
ESO is not bad as a game, but it's bad MMO, I just pretend that I play modded Morrowind and I don't look at other players. You will love the movement of your character in GW, I can't go back to WoW anymore.
---
If only the norn could get redesigned this way so they're more than just "man too big"
---
I watched some character creation videos and I really like the models, they are better than in wow or eso.
---
The lack of an upgrade slot severely hampers their effectiveness and IMO makes them borderline worthless.
---
I'm sorry, is this some sort of human joke that i'm too asura to understand?
---
You forgot to mention how incredibly difficult it is to get to this level of control.
---
&gt; Regarding classes; what is the current PvE meta like?
---
There's offensive supports that focus on providing dps buffs and boons as well as crowd control, healing, condi cleanses and similar. In raids one of them is having a tank role which is pretty simple - boss follows the target with highest toughness, however there are bosses with more defined aggro which can also be random. Supports are usually 40-60% of the group, the rest is DPS classes.
---
Core guard is one of the stronger classes without elite spec, but with those, all classes are relevant in every game mode.
---
&gt; What content do I do first after lvl 80?   
---
Story is IMO the best way to get into the game. It serves as "mandatory" map exploration as well as some feature introduction (like masteries which are mandatory for certain story episodes).
---
&gt; Gem store "must-haves"?
---
You'll want living seasons because they include a big part of lore and season 3+4 also provide new maps, masteries, easier way to get gear and they are generally THE end game open world content considering that there's more LS maps than expansion maps.
---
From convenience items you have copper fed salvage kit, bank/material/inventory bag upgrades which can be considered pretty valuable in general. Shared inventory slots, character slots, unbreakable gathering tools, VIP passes arent as good IMO, but it's very subjective and depends on what you're doing in game generally.
---
&gt; Other resources?
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/co10ck/what_should_i_get_in_gw2_to_increase_the_fun_of/
---
https://snowcrows.com/ for raid builds
---
https://discretize.eu/ for fractal builds
---
Metabattle for builds in general (as well as some guides like gearing up or getting into wvw).
---
&gt; Elite specs?
---
pretty sure that wiki has everything you need to know. Short answer: they can improve one of the roles that your class is doing decently or give your class a role that it's lacking. 
---
&gt; Gearing?
---
Nothing changed. As mentioned above, metabattle (as well as wiki) has guide on gearing up, check them out.
---
&gt; Legendary crafting?
---
I'd ignore this for now. You have plenty of catching up to do and legendary crafting is a long term goal which isnt worth focusing on immediately. It's mostly used for convenience (free stat/upgrade/infusion swapping) and cosmetics. 
---
&gt; Boss trains?
---
People do them, but expansion map metas are more popular, more fun (IMO) and some of them are a lot more profitable.
---
&gt; Guides, veterans?
---
yes, mentor and commander tags are still a thing. For guilds you can search on official forums or /r/guildrecruitment .
---
&gt; In your opinion, is the game dying? What does the future of GW2 hold?
---
That depends on what you play. Competitive part of gw2 (raids, pvp, wvw, fractals) gets a lot less attention than gem store and open world so population can be low at certain periods. I dont think the game is dying, but I also dont think that anything good will happen in the future when the main content of the game is open world stuff that you do once and forget since there's no much replayability.
---
1. For most pve I find anything goes. You will always encounter someone who dislikes what you chose. I recommend woodenpotato youtube channel. He made a specific video covering all classes.
---
2. I would go through the story by the order released. With some fractals. If you want mounts you can start POF first chapter. Mounts work on all zones, but imo would deminish of the experience.
---
3. Copper fed salvagomatic. Dont touch the silver one.  Other than that airship or any other passes for QOL. also the permanent  port to friend thingy is a nice addition. As for the tools, I only recommend the ones that yield sprockets or other currency. 
---
4. Gw2timer.com for bosses timers,account management and maps.
---
5. Meta healer is druid. I would also put energy into the red mastery points (base game tyria maps) for autolooting.
---
6. The meta changed to conditions a long time ago. I still use viper armor. Cant say if it changed again. Probably did.
---
As for crafting, you will need plenty of resources. The new leg items are collection based. So a lot of items to find and craft.
---
Hope this helps for a starter.
---
I was literally thinking to myself that they weren't even putting in any effort into masking their names but this explains it. lol
---
I'm just going to start from the bottom and work my way up. 
---
10.  The game will continue on indefinitely.  The communication has started to improve since a recent community uprising.  There's a new release on Tuesday which will trigger a mini MMO "Honey Moon" the game will go through 2-3 weeks where it's abnormally active before settling back into normal events.  Your experience as someone that quit in 2013/2014 is incomparable to someone that's been playing since 2012/2013; there's plenty of game to experience, plenty of account progression and plenty of individual skill progression -- the game is much more well understood. 
---
9. /r/GuildRecruitment various Discord Servers and the weekly Q/A threads.  People are helpful, but extremely opinionated and it's important to form your own opinions rather than letting other people significantly influence your perspectives.  What I will say is that newer players often end up running around in HoT/PoF areas on *weak* builds that have poorly balanced offensive buffing, defensive/sustain because they boosted.  Take your time.  YouTube from 2016-2018
---
8.  Boss trains are a thing, however, they're much less rewarding and seen as more of an AFK low effort/reward ratio.  They've mostly been supplanted by Heart of Thorns Meta Events; VB, AB, TD &amp; DS and some LS4 metas like Sunspear GH and stuff in the Domain of Istan.  World Bosses still get run, but they're not nearly as great value as they were before. 
---
1. Legendary Crafting - Mostly for better; precursor crafting is finally a thing.  It tends to have some time-gated material costs to preserve market value (generation I) and Generation II is account-bound (entirely new generation of legendaries!) These are mostly enormous goldsinks that are between 1500 &amp; 2500g.  WvW is only necessary for Gift of Battle; you don't need full WvW map completion anymore.  It's more a function of time and energy.   Gen I are easier than Gen II.  Mostly skins that come with the luxury of always being BiS/Asc Stats and have full stat-swapping capabilities out of combat. You can freely remove sigils from them as well.  Legendary Armor is a thing too; both generic PvP/WvW and Raid-Centric PvE armor -- raid armor has some serious clipping and dying issues but is prestigious, animated armor (W1-W4). 
---
1.  It varies depending on boss and content design.  Condition damage no longer is capped to 25.  Conditions will stack up to about ~ 120 stacks in a group before going "!" lol.  Condition Duration is a stat that was introduced via Heart of Thorns and significantly overhauled condition builds in the sense that longer conditions = vastly more damage.  Power Damage is still meta in a lot of dungeon and fractal fights (dungeons were abandoned for fractals) because played correctly it has incredible burst (DH, Weaver, Soulbeast, Holosmith etc).  Boon Supports (Boon Duration) mirror's condition duration and enables a lot of powerful support builds (eg; Scourge, Tempest, Firebrand, Chrono, Druid, Renegade etc).  
---
1.  250 HP per elite specialization; PoF/HoT HP's count for 10; they're more or less new trait lines that have to be equipped in the bottom-most specialization slot (old trait system is super RIP since 2015).  They allow for a new weapon and usually modify the class-profession mechanics; function keys -- F1/F2/F3/F4 or add some sort of unique mechanic.  They're meant to provide additional gameplay options, and are being regularly counter-balanced between core specializations (vanilla classes).  I'd say that playing GW2 w/o an elite specialization is a lot less fun.  
---
1. There are some powerful add-ons and overlays if you want to min/max the experience, but they can take away from the organic nature of the game.  GW2 Tac0, Radial Mounts, ArcDPS, GW2Hook (SweetFX Split) and such like that.  ArenaNet still has a harsh stance on 3rd party tools and applications; GW2 Launch Buddy is another one.  
---
1.  Gem Store - Copper Fed Salvage'o'matic, account-upgrades (bank/bag slots for favorite character), one set of infinite gathering tools, maybe silver fed and shared inventory slots.  Those are the main things.
---
1.  I'd suggest starting with the story, 1-80, LS2, HoT LS3, PoF LS4 / =&gt; LS 5.  Find a solid build on something like Metabattle's open world section or consult WoodenPotatoes recent build series as builds come out for optimized solo play.  Running a strong, well synergized build is very helpful for not excessively struggling with the game. 
---
OOF.
---
You never did that did you literally start playing yesterday GW2? Dungeons where a daily thing, and that's that. You would farm two or three dungeons for that 3-5g as a daily reward. Doing easy paths more than one time per day wasn't profitable. I am stating the fact of the obvious.
---
 [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dungeon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dungeon) 
---
GW2 dungeons are nerfed to sht and ruled out of content.
---
kys &gt;&lt;
---
Yeah, I was really pissed when I started playing. I paid for HoT and PoF only to find out that I was only paying for about half the storyline... To someone invested in the plot, that's a massive kick in the nuts to be told "Oyeah, no, you have to pay for even more DLC than what we told you about!" It doesn't help that one chapter in the story is inaccessible to players who weren't around at the release.
---
Ive always considered picking the right exotic weapon sigils as an lvl 80 thing
---
There is a content creator rule about the number of posts you make vs how many are self promoting.
---
Example 80% community post 20% self promotion
---
\&gt;"Why do you need a consistent team to do said content, when your statement is based on net-gold sheet, which I am going to ignore just to make my point?"
---
wew lad. you out-wordsmithed me.
---
&gt;I want to know why creating content for Guild Wars 2, is getting me banned from the official Guild Wars 2 Discord.  Especially when said content, is in no way controversial.  Seriously....   I doubt I will get an answer, will likely get banned, but I dunno....  We'll see...
---
Also ---  Dunno how the statement, ....... "I want to know why creating content for Guild Wars 2, is getting me banned from the official Guild Wars 2 Discord." isn't clear enough to state where the ban came from.
---
not that ive ever found a way for.  worse, when i got the catmander tag, the default changed again. i forget what it was, but the current default for me is pink cat
---
wtf are you talking about? Why are twisting the subject. Pre HoT, arah paths gave 3,5 gold, now the give 1,5gold. get that through your head. Tokens are useless since the only thing you can do with those is buy exotic weapons and throw them in the toilet, which its value hangs on the RNG. Get your facts straight.
---
Guesswork here: low manning videos are like griffon gliding or WvW roaming videos. They don't promote a channel, they just show content being played. OP might have specifically promoted his content.
---
Now if only they gave her a personality.
---
I do not think that the game will close in the next two years. For $ 30 you will get many hours of pleasure. This is not such a big amount, in my opinion, to hesitate for a long time)
---
No reason to ONLY post vods though
---
But, my videos are about the game...
---
SO let me get this straight....
---
I can't post something about the game, unless it's DIRECTLY about the game, inside of a channel created SOLELY for Content Creation that promotes Guild Wars 2.
---
Sounds about...  Actually.... No.... That DOESN'T sound right, because it's nine kinds of mentally handicapped, but ok, whatever...  Other people aren't as logical of a person as me, and sometimes can't make those connections.  I guess I'm just banned then, and there's nothing I can do about it.  Honestly, I'm tired of getting shat by game companies who refuse to properly moderate someone who is using their name in attempts to assert power over others.
---
How do you cancel the dive for those quick ‚Äúbouncing‚Äù maneuvers to dip under ledges and such?
---
What sub did you post it in? Link?
---
They are very old content that i get a group within minutes of creating a lfg.
---
For such content, among fractals, raids, tons of season 3,4 zones i think they are still popular enough as people still wanna try them out for the first time, title, or unique skins
---
For some reason people are still afraid of creating their own lfg, even the veterans who have done fractals.
---
Ive seen a lot of high ap characters with ascention wings, glowy infusions, cool fashion, and without cleared story mode to enter explorable mode.
---
Some of them keep quiet, and later on say something like "i didnt do this in ages" or "first time doing this dungeon"
---
Title doesn't feel relevant to the picture. Wouldn't it be gotta go fast for a long long time?
---
Not in a subreddit....  I posted it in the Reddit Discord for Guild Wars 2, under the "Content Creation" text channel.  As for a link?  I can link the discord, but I can't link what I posted, because they've banned me from the discord, and I am incapable of bringing back up the post to defend myself with.
---
Well I don‚Äôt know what the discord rules are I was talking the gw2 sub reddit
---
I do hope they are new norn armors
---
at least it wasn't a month
---
Tokens have a value according to GW2efficiency. The second post in the thread I linked factor in that value. You may not believe that you can get 30c or whatever it is per token (and I'm not sure it's the same today) but the math is done in that thread).  According to that, NOT EVEN FACTORING IN THE FACT THAT YOU CAN KEEP GOING, at least at the time that thread was posted, dungeons were about equal to or a little more profitable now. One is us is reading stuff and looking at the math. One of us is repeating the same thing over and over again. If you don't want to believe dungeon tokens have some value, you'd have to go and prove that. Some people do think they have value and those people are in fact, doing math. 
---
If you're not going to look at at read the thread and look at the math, what is there to talk about?
---
maybe spend some time reading that page..
---
&gt; "There is no official Discord or other voice channel for Guild Wars 2"
---
and 
---
&gt; "These are Discord channels of popular fansites. Please note the servers below are unofficial and not affiliated with ArenaNet."
---
I renamed them the sheme "PVP Bot Day-Month-Year" to track how many games they are playing per day. And if they bot 24/7 or with breaks.
---
I prefer the concept art.
---
I joined the discord just to see the specific rules, since you seem quite unclear. This is the relevant rule in this case:
---
&gt;# Self-promotion
---
We're generally okay with self promotion in the #fan-creations channel. That being said, if you're trying to promote your own content, especially if you're profiting off of it (i.e. offering art commisions or selling a product), ask a mod or admin for permission first.
---
Technically linking to a your "new Youtube channel" would probably fall under profiting off it. Thus you should have talked with the admins about it first. As the rule stated. As for no warning: The rules are the warning. Just like how in real life you do tend to get punished for committing a crime even if it was "just the first time I did it!!". 
---
You also seem to be quite confused about the actual role of the Discord Channel. The channel (like this subreddit) are NOT official Guild Wars 2 things, they are community things.
---
The precedent hasn't been set for decades.... This game, including Guild Wars the ORIGINAL game, hasn't even been out for more than 1 decade.  Also, I'm fairly certain that because you can't even properly spell "Precedence", that you don't really understand the full context of the legal description that I'm putting forth.  The "Precedence" not, "Precedents" has been set, and the moment that they allow someone unaffiliated, to use that name, whether they declare it as official or not, doesn't matter.  I can go find the proper copyright lawsuit if you'd like to prove what I'm saying, but I honestly don't think it's worth the time.
---
To put it simply ,they do use magic, but focus on weapons
---
I really hope they nerf feel my wrath in some way. Not needing any boon duration on the quickness support is just way too broken. Also breaks raids and limits the meta a lot. Stacking dhs/pChronos opens another dps slot basically and keeps all other professions out of meta.
---
not at all similar. They only want to consume everything and use you as fertilizer for their young and very aggressive. I prefer the Sylvari xD
---
It‚Äôs like $2 per episode. Way more than worth it, in my opinion. Content costs money. 
---
They should definitely make the story progression timeline (ps, lw2, hot, lw3, pof, lw4) more obvious to new players and make a bundle available for add-on when buying the expansions so people don‚Äôt get blindsided though.
---
I relog already if I'm already 30s crippled
---
Crafting? May be faster but not the most efficient way, gold wise.
---
No
---
About 43gb for an english-only installation.
---
"They give someone X, meaning that they punish other people"... what?
---
*CAN I SEE A MANAGER ?*
---
Honestly it‚Äôs great.  I just started back up again after taking a few years off.  Game is super fun, story kinda blows in my opinion but the new areas I‚Äôm getting to now are among the best I‚Äôve ever seen.  Hopefully the story gets good too.  WvW is amazing, crafting is accessible.  There‚Äôs a decent community that comes and goes with the content releases.  Depends on what you‚Äôre into, but its definitely worth giving a shot because base game is free.
---
One word of caution I guess... it‚Äôs very casual friendly, and it‚Äôs been designed that way deliberately so it will never change.  So there‚Äôs no need to rush through stuff to get anywhere.   almost everything scales to help newer players for better or worse, and there‚Äôs basically no gear grind.  I think that‚Äôs where a lot of the hate came from originally... sometimes people like a challenge, or a manufactured goal to aim for.  
---
Also, the community can be toxic towards the devs and the game itself.  It‚Äôs really a fun, intelligently designed MMO if you can ignore the cacaphony of voices shouting about how shit it is all the time.  To be fair, the devs have made questionable decisions at times, they overuse buzzwords like ‚Äúcadence‚Äù to the point of absurdity, and their communication is a total trainwreck. But the game itself is fun as hell.
---
and here i thought this was going to be a boring lazy sunday
---
üçø
---
Looked into this, we're both right actually, it depends on the dictionary that you use.
---
So we're both also wrong, to which I am obviously willing to admit.  Are you?
---
They could give expansion discount keys to botters they banned, so they are more inclined to return maybe
---
Maybe, but Anet seems to change land how they want, just look at Istan.
---
If you don't think that the Edward Snowden leaks are real, then you sir are a totally different level of stupid.  Sorry to advise you of this, but Cyberwarfare is a real thing, and when a company knows that a terrorist organization is taking up arms in their gaming platform and does NOT report them... That's harbouring terrorists and is tantamount to High Treason.  So ya... Blizzard is to blame for it.  They created the platform, they let them exist, and they've never once apologized publicly for it.  As for the other discord I was banned from, their mod WAS A PEDOPHILE, you can find that person STILL... I even created a video, covering where the company that banned me from their game ADMIT TO ME IN DISCORD, that they had a pedophile moderating said discord.  Sooooo......  Before you think that I've gone to far, maybe you might want to consider what the fuck is real and what isn't.  I don't just attack multi-million dollar corporations without rhyme or reason.
---
Concept art Caithe is dummy hot.
---
we're not "both right" and no it doesn't "depend on the dictionary"
---
I used a word in its proper context and spelled it correctly.
---
the fact that you mistook that for a different word isn't you being also right.. it's just you being an idiot.
---
Fun is subjective
---
Trudat
---
This thread was a fucking ride
---
i mean if u like the game after a while just buy path of fire etc
---
Ok, I'm reading it....  And you're right, I did read it wrong in that --- NOPE... I didn't read it wrong..  I am not claiming that ANYONE who calls me on my bullshit is defending a pedophile.  I am calling YOU on attempting to defend a pedophile, by posting my verbal thwarting of them for having assaulted a burglar victim as an attempt at defamation of character.  Soooo....  If you're attempting to defame my character by presenting an attack against someone, without full context, in a negative light, then yes... I am going to say that you are defending a pedophile... Not just anyone though... Only you...
---
Sometimes I get defaulted to pink cat, sometimes to green normal tag. It's weird.
---
I‚Äôll try this tonight, thanks.
---
the more the merrier! make yourself comfortable!
---
If they make something and put it in their test client and it works, how are they supposed to know that it will break when put on live?
---
Agree, a real gem.
---
"verbal thwarting" is going to be my new favourite expression.
---
Thanks for verifying that I'd rather not deal with people in that discord...  If you're one of the admins and you'd rather back the people who will support pedophiles and people who assault victims, then I want nothing to do with your discord.  Especially so, if this is the type of people in that discord... Talk about truly toxic people...  I posted twice to a "Content Creation" channel, so if you want to call that "Spamming" in the "Wrong Channel", then by all means... Go right ahead...
---
3 is pretty much filler story. There's content there but nothing all that important happens for the main plot, aside from ep 5.
---
2 is slow paced but HoT makes little sense without it as a prequel.
---
4 is the actual ending of PoF so yeah, pretty important.
---
Oh, and other people in your reddit history it seems. 
---
&gt;Congratulations @KodeManGuy -- You're defending a pedophile.... Real top notch kinda guy aren't ya?
---
I simply posted the picture since it was from Discord and it does show that you seem to have quite some issues keeping your temper and thus it isn't really that unlikely that it would have happened again and thus got you banned again.
---
Man I wish they had embraced the shapeshifter aspect of the norn in some other way so that it was more prominent in game than racials that are hardly used.
---
Thanks for the input
---
Ah, thanks.
---
Thank you for the info
---
Concept art is still the best one, would love to have that armor ingame.
---
Ok, so allow me offer full context...  
---
I show up in the Legends of Aria Discord.  At that time, it's labelled "Unofficial", but surprisingly has officially titled Citadel Studios staff members in the discord.  I hear about someone who was killed and robbed in-game, and then taunted about it in Discord.  At which point, the person who was killed and robbed begins to lash out.  Note that the person said NOTHING about the in-game encounter, until the topic was broached by the person who killed their toon and robbed them.  (At this point, I would like to note that both the Victim AND the Burglar/Griefer are two entirely different people from both me AND the pedophile.)  So the victim begins to lash out at the griefer, after being taunted in discord.  At which point, the convicted pedophile, who was a moderator for this game's 'Unofficial' discord begins to stick up for the griefer and tell the victim to be quite.  To which I reply, "Hey, he's the one who raised the subject, and if he's going to taunt the guy, then he should be allowed to be verbally attacked back or banned one of the two."  To which I receive a temporary silence for, from the stated convicted pedophile.  That temporary silence, along with my outburst for receiving as much, is noted in the picture that you brought up.
---
You have no idea what you are talking about lol. Do you think the subreddit is run by Anet too?
---
Interesting fact, you can still see the 2nd design in Game. It's on the loading screen for the story step when you go to the meeting of the Destiny Edge members, 1st instance of level 40 story
---
you can still find it in game, in loading screens for certain story missions
---
Bots are ONE of the reasons PvP has so few people now days. I use to PvP all the time but the amount of bots per game became obscene.
---
The free base game has months worth of content and gives you the chance to experience the mechanics. I personally think that the story there is awful, tho. Rushed and badly written.
---
But if you like the base stuff, the expansions and living world will blow you away, they are exponentially better in every regard (plus recently they made it so that if you purchase the second expac, you get the first one free).
---
They don't live up to the drawbacks by a long shot. Removing instead of replacing content is good for nobody.
---
Sure sure, I don't know what I'm talking about.... I've only had to read over copyright laws and stuff for my youtube channel for the last 3 months.  Still though, I don't know anything about it...  
---
Oh, also... Where did you get that I thought ANet ran the discord?  I never once said that... I did say that ANet has linked the Reddit Discord for Guild Wars 2, on their OFFICIAL Wiki Page.  Which is to state that it's a REDDIT Discord, that is linked to on the Guild Wars 2 Wiki.  Doesn't mean I said it was official....  
---
Sooooo.... Who has no idea about what they are talking about?  Cause from my perspective, it seems to me, like that person is more likely to be the one who came in, half-way read a conversation, and then decided to play fanboi in the echo-chamber.
---
Great news u claimed it have great time ! /w if miss some tokens
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
That's helpful, thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
I am very casual so that's no problem, and toxicity is in wow too so I am used to that.
---
Why do you think making a map not frozen in time is mutually exclusive with keeping old content?
---
The Anonaly, the bandits, the riftstalker are all proofs that a map can evolve, be *alive* and relevant without losing anything.
---
Thanks for your permission. Means the world to us.
---
I think minigames can be actual content if done well. We'll figure out in two days I guess
---
Yeah I dont necessarily think they're bad, but having this many teasers of basically the same thing?
---
I feel like they posted this one a couple of times already :)
---
How do I join sN and be a cool kid?
---
I'd leave at least 50Gb for the game, and then about 20% of free disk space for better OS performance
---
Why doesn‚Äôt your warrior have mace/mace to CC?
---
Technically Sylvari would have been the same if they listened to their god/creator. Not mordys fault his creations got corrupted by the other filthy races.
---
I assumed souffle had scholar/zerk so around 15-20% BD, how does it get to 52s total quick?
---
Testing at 17% bd i got like 27-28s~ of quickness from 3x mantra of potence/2x FMW and solace so no way it'd go up to 52s with another FMW unless i'm missing something, is she running diviner's?
---
Also since quickness caps at 5 stacks wouldn't the solace mantra/liberator's vow/stalwart speed be wasted since the other stacks (3x potence/2x FMW) are longer duration?
---
Each teaser feels like "d√©j√† vu" for me, weird
---
Welcome back, festival trailer in 144p.
---
&gt; but you can't deny the RPG and MMO systems are well designed 
---
does any change remove
---
role playing game
---
and massively, multipler or online from the game in retail ?
---
no ? i thought so. Fuck off
---
Aaaaaaaaaaaand it's more party/minigames teasers, AGAIN.
---
&gt;I think minigames can be actual content
---
........you really said this unironically?
---
Sylvari are just dryads
---
Third one from the left in the first pic is named Karen, 100%.
---
That is a beehive if I've ever seen one.
---
feelsbadman
---
Hmm ability to color back pieces would be nice and as an engine main I‚Äôd like skins for my kits. Also like more housing options it make
---
Me wanna invest in scribe if I had a house to decorate oh and a group mount like a dolyak
---
Don't forget Moa stance, 66% increased duration of applied boons.
---
The alternative is still no new spec though. This game is so friendly to alts that the concept of "mains" is pretty diminished. If a fun new Engineer spec comes out, the vast majority of the player base can play that content, even if they weren't playing engie before.
---
Thanks for proofing his point
---
WOW , that's trully amazing :o
---
Ah yeah i completely forgot about moa stance share
---
Am I the only one who pleased they are making a "party" map? (Assuming they don't alter it LS1 style...)
---
I think we're all forgetting how grim the end of LS4 was. And although we're all sitting on the edge of our seats for hardcore content, I can't exactly criticize the new map idea either.
---
Something I have to give kudos for is that they've never done a permanent "festival"-style map before., aside from Bazaar of the Four Winds (which was only a temporary fixture.)
---
I think, from a game design perspective, diversity is important whenever they wanna introduce new maps. If you want to fight big monsters, you go to Dragonfall, Silverwastes, whatever. If you want a light-hearted map to relax, then this new map looks like it perfectly fills that niche.
---
&gt; so they hit considerably harder than fine or masterwork gear even without sigils of fire and air.
---
Aren't the sigils offsetting the rarity? That's what I heard here on reddit.
---
Bit of a late reply but it reminded me of this https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/7vbpzm/solo_kill_rubick_on_an_invoker/
---
Wait... I'm confused... why would a reaper have a staff?  How does a reaper get a wolf as a familiar?
---
So many questions
---
It *is* only the prologue patch, I'm assuming the story and lore will start happening with episode 1.
---
Minion reaper uses a staff as a second weapon sometimes.
---
I really hope this can re-invigorate my enjoyment for the PvE side since they are clearly going to ignore WvW where I spend most of my time... when I log in. 
---
But if not, hey it doesn't have a sub, so I can go play other things and come back to enjoy each LS chapter with the guild mates.
---
If you played a lot of GW1, that could also be an effect of them going to MORE places we've been before, with a graphic upgrade.
---
No. Let them stay dead and buried in the dumpster of terrible ideas where they belong, forever cursed. Let their names be spoken in cautionary tales to scare fractal initiates, from now until the end of days.
---
They often manage to do a perfect spike. Like when CI was a thing. Imagine a bot that can interrupt your skills perfectly.
---
Also reaper use staff for the 4 marks for the condi cleanse.
---
They should give every instability the Slippery Slope/Birds treatment.
---
I'm aware dude, Reapers just usually don't. Can't say iv ever personally seen one.
---
Last night I met a newbie who liked my armor and we started chatting. He was an experienced player from wow but completely lost in guild wars 2. We played for three hours and became friends. He was so excited to do everything like you said and kept thanking me for showing small details like depositing material to big decisions like picking a class. Before they logged off they expressed how happy they are to have met me and excited to play the game today together with his buddy. That type of energy, freshness, and excitement really made me happy as well and I‚Äôm gonna use a new character to play with them :)
---
Pretty sure axe + off-hand would still be a superior choice... but to each their own
---
The skills triggered by sigils scale with the player using them, but Masterwork sigils have the longest cooldown, 9s. 
---
With a bloodbound greatsword as a warrior or guardian, I will kill all ministry guard in "The Commander" before the sigil triggers again. That extra damage on 5 enemies at the start of the fight is a neat bonus when you can't get better weapons, but it will only affect 5 enemies.  
---
Even when I'm slower and it takes more than 9 seconds, one or two more sigil triggers is still less damage than the extra damage from the stats on all skills. 
---
The different isn't totally massive, specially if you keep your gear at your level, but a bloodbound weapon is bought just once, and works for the whole run from level 1 to 60.  
---
No need to waste time checking the gear, since level up rewards and mission rewards will give you enough armor to make do.   
---
Even if you keep in the bank a bunch of exotics leveling gear and trade it around, that's till time spend swithing gear.  
---
So any small advantage given by the sigils is just invalidated by all the time you save rushing from mission to mission without having to check your gear anymore.
---
Long story short, the bursts of damage you get from the sigil won't surpass the extra permanent flat damage you get on all your skills and all the time saved by not having to keep your gear up to date.
---
If someone does runs only to the level 10 key, it doesn't matter that much, but going to level 60 they are definitely better.
---
You do not have the data to say what most people have or do not have.  You cannot prove actual amounts of obsidian shards conclusively with a bell curve, which measures simply distribution.  Continuously responding to me doesn't create the necessary data.  Weak.
---
You can get a more reliable condi cleanse from axe/dagger though, which isnt reliant on a mark proc
---
Thank you.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Barnum and Bailey world, 
---
Just as phony as it can be,
---
 But it wouldn‚Äôt be make believe,
---
 If you believed in me.‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs a good play, not quite sure what you mean though.
---
how about scrap the whole instability idea entirely and make the fractals challenging by themselves
---
maybe add instabilities as optional for bonus relics so ppl can farm their fractal god faster
---
I think they should do it the other way around.   
---
Keep instabilitys as the default but introduce an instability-less easy mode that gives less rewards. 
---
Like still counting for dailys but with less relics, encriptions and no prestines. So people that don¬¥t know their classes or the fractals well enough to deal with them can learn and still do dailys but the good players can do the regular fractals for the full reward.
---
I'd say it's Part 2 :D
---
Played WoW for many years til it got too stale and went back to GW2. I‚Äôve been playing now for a few months and having lots of fun doing solo stuff and can see that working for a while learning core game, trying different classes, learning builds, etc but eventually I‚Äôm gonna need to find a helpful guild which hasn‚Äôt happened yet. They‚Äôre there but I‚Äôve been doing my own thing and don‚Äôt like being so clueless after mastering WoW. I‚Äôll either socialize or find another game so I guess it depends on your play style.
---
You mean wvw update and raid wing are update :O
---
I'd love to see SS come back. It was a fun instability. The current ones have close to no impact what so ever.
---
Birds can go fuck themselves
---
What was your most recent blast from the past?
---
That already exists. It's called t2.
---
Anything goes in openworld PvE.
---
https://pastebin.com/83q11FEt
---
So, T1.
---
But but but but LS is free cont---wait
---
I'm so glad the Nevermore is overrated, makes my Bifr√∂st more special. But I love the picture.
---
How can you forget when this exact screenshot is posted twice a day
---
Thanks a lot!
---
well Im still upset, that caithe isnt as beautiful as on her  first concept art :(
---
Well then people wouldn¬¥t complain...
---
This would be a way for people to bad to adjust to instabilitys to play T4 with all the mechanics and mob strengh that dosn¬¥t exist on the lower tiers.   
---
But i think we also could just tell all these people like Sublimatioo to go play the low tier fracs.
---
ooh cuz i popped in the sub once every few months to check it. but i guess the community is toxic the same. so i'll just take it down
---
Community needs more people like you.
---
ooh i'll have to check it out later. thanks for the suggestion
---
most of bot bans come in waves, so someday they all could be gone at once
---
Shit!! Impressive!
---
Bots aren‚Äôt good enough to make it to the top 250 generally so you‚Äôre not going to see them on the leaderboards or at much higher ratings than what is posted above...
---
Swtor? Yeah, cause the Zakuul storyline was so good, BW didn't cut the planned third expac for it and rush it to conclusion in KotET because the playerbase hated it so much
---
Thank you so much! Yes it's amazing really. Sure thing, here [https://imgur.com/bk6HiKy](https://imgur.com/bk6HiKy) The armor from top to toe is: raven mantle, tribal vestment, the fire gloves from gemstore, bounty hunter bottoms and tribal shoes.
---
I am, thanks a lot !
---
It's not really about difficulty, hard encounters are fun. It's instabilities which are cancerous for no reason. You can ignore half of them with certain comps, but they are still annoying and boring to play with.
---
Permission Problem
---
You don't have permission to do that.
---
PoF really makes zero sense without 3, despite 3 being a bunch of filler.
---
So if this prologue is pretty much just fluff, does anyone know when episode 1 is supposed to drop?
---
There is, but it's a necessary sacrifice sometimes for the sake of change. Change implies...losing the old to make way for something new.  Having phased maps where one instance is still running quests from seven years ago while another phase is updated is a worse decision, imo.
---
Why even play the game, just watch videos.
---
why did you get downvoted for that lol
---
I don't wanna be that guy but fortunately when boons get corrupted, the conditions will have a set timer.
---
By searching on google. There's at least 5 results on both so there's no point in explaining when there's already guides/videos on it.
---
Can you give me a link, I did search on google.
---
You only need PoF which is about 30$. HoT is included for free when you buy PoF.
---
I'd suggest trying the game for fee and then decide if you want to buy xpacs since they mostly bring end game content.
---
If you can do all the griffon adventures (master &amp; expert) on gold, you'll have the skills needed to perform this kind of maneuvers. It's quite a feat.
---
It's crazy how between GW1 and GW2 there was basically no additional "basic guild functionality" added. Your only options in game of recruiting is by having somebody spamming map chat with "XYZ Recruiting for PVP | PVE | Raids | ETC ETC ETC" in various map chats. There's no way of coordinating events for the guild (like a basic calendar), no way of sending out a mass message to some or all guild members, no way of handling applications... As per usual, the only places these exist is if you use a third party website or something. Things like the guild missions and guild hall decoration are *nice*, albeit essentially abandoned now, but they IMO should be considered the frosting on the more substantial "cake" of guild features... i.e. guild content is essentially just a tub of frosting in GW2.
---
Some questions from a returning player:
---
I have just finished Path of Fire for the first time after returning from a 2 years break and I'm kind of surprised that the dragon mounts aren't in the expansion
---
I have played none of the living worlds and kind of want new content, I have 4 lvl 80s and a lvl 70. How do the Living Worlds compare to each other? (also I know about the new one coming out next week)
---
LW3 seems decently priced and has the dragon mount so that's on top of my list, are the older ones still fun to play? I mainly want new areas to explore, I'm so-so about the story missions. I play solo without even a guild, my characters have the exotics with the right stats for the most part but nothing more really. I have 2 Hearts of Maguuma stored for some better weapons, maybe, no idea how difficult the other ingredients are to obtain (*reading the highest comment, I should probably forget about it) . Never played fractals and didn't do dungeons since GW2 base, I don't like copying popular builds
---
Some other quick but important question:
---
1) What do you salvage/what do you sell? I used to salvage all the blues and below but my inventory space is running over with 250+ ingredients stacks. I have 250 ectoplasm, but only around 20g on my characters.
---
2) What do you do with exotics that have the wrong stats or are bound to the player/character? They take up quite a bit of my space but salvaging them doesn't seem worth it
---
I don't really look for the bounty hunts trains, I rarely join one
---
So, what, every fractal tier is the same save for higher boss health and damage?
---

---
I used to play all the mini games fairly frequently back in the day. So you aren't entirely alone.
---
I personally love to see content that feels like the devs are getting to enjoy the process of development, rather than ticking boxes on their end to ship boxes for us to tick on our end.
---
That really is good idea.
---
You stole my idea. What if Anet was working on IA and they are testing them ingame? That could actualy be an amazing idea to implement for better ingame IA...
---
Let us dream!!!
---
Because all the festival stuff (3 of the 4 videos they posted) is all re-cut from what they showed at the announcement. They aren't new, and they may not be all that interesting to some... but, it isn't bad to constantly post reminders about content release, including rehashed videos, nearing the release day. It is just called marketing.
---
It just feels weird...
---
For 33000 logs it 99000 seconds.
---
So there are 3600 seconds in a single hour .
---
Let's do some math? 
---
It's nearly 30 hours doing that endlessly
---
People disapointet with communication from anet
---
I only use skyscale anywhere. It's the real legendary mount that's why ppl who complain it's hard ( it is not) are wrong
---
I'm not trying to get into semantics here, all I'm trying to say is that using the griffon you can reach the top of any map that enables use of mounts.
---
Its still better than some other MMO where you clearly see bots teleporting, no clipping, flying and stealing mobs for quest that prevent you for completing your objective. At least those bots are peacefull to you and didnt impact you (Farming one not PvP one).
---
the last one isn't real Caithe. It is a branded creature.
---
Them, if this image is recent, thats an old account that get back...
---
Skyscale is faster than raptor or jackal since terrain is not always exactly flat or climbing up .
---
If it is flat for longer distance then u can use beetle 
---
The Springer needs platform to jump on.  Afully mastered skyscale do not . Try do map completion in verdant blink and you will understand what I am saying
---
Keyword : high point of start .most of the time u do not start from a tower .
---
Listen I love my griffon but it is less useful since the skyscale like every other mount.
---
Is it sad that the person recording is on the losing side while facing against bots?
---
Your positive discrimination is someone else's negative discrimination.
---
Everyone or no one. You don't deserve it more than anyone else.
---
We spent half the season under siege by Kralkatorrik, in an almost impossible situation where killing him means the end of the world. Refugees literally hiding underground from branded. Not even the mists were safe. The world got so messed up that Kourna was becoming twisted with different fragments of the mists.
---
And yeah, when Aurene died, it DID feel extremely hopeless for the four to five months between episode 5 and episode 6.
---
Just because episode 6 had dragon jesus does not change the tone of the rest of the season.
---
Hell, even earlier episode, like Domain of Kourna with Joko, felt depressing as hell because of how visually dark the zone looks. And Domain of Istan wasn't exactly cheerful either with its tense background music.
---
S4 was extremely dire throughout, and a festival episode is a good relief from it.
---
Iiiiih! thank you so much!
---
Oh my
---
The fat should burn well enough!
---
I thought we were talking about the *end* of it, don't move goal posts. There was nothing grim or hopeless about the ending, which is what you claimed was grim.
---
Game is alive. Guilds are dead.
---
&gt; Mentioned that last part because I'm not really trying to grind other than 100%ing maps. I don't know. It just find it difficult to get gold
---
Just play normally, do your dailies, do some meta events, sell what you get from it. I just did the Auric basin meta last night, made something around 5 gold from just selling the loot I got from unidentified gear only, normally I can get around 5-10 depending on how lucky I get.
---
&gt; Much obliged, that was very helpful. I'm a terrible hoarder in GW2 and running out of space.
---
Glad I could help. Try and sell any materials you aren't using if you're really struggling. T3 and T4 materials sell for a lot more but they are a little harder to come by. T5 materials sell for very little but you literally always have too many of these.
---
&gt; Say, can you get those 250 stack salvage kits in-game somewhere? I vaguely remember them costing gems last time I played
---
[Mystic salvage kit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Salvage_Kit)
---
Combine a fine salvage kit, a journeyman salvage kit, and a master salvage kit, along with one mystic forge stone in the mystic forge.
---
You have to launch off of the gryphon while above your maximum height to increase your height limit.
---
Basically, hit the gryphon's height limit, use bond of vigor to spam flap and get above the height limit, then jump off with bond of faith. &gt;!An end-of-the-world barrier also works for getting infinite height by just spamming flap while flying into it. Just don't jump off until you get away from the wall first, or you get teleported to the last valid ground you stood on!!&lt;
---
people undervalue the usefulness of training guilds. It's also smart to connect with several, like you did, so you don't have to be super concerned about working your schedule with a single set of people. Pretty cool.
---
She now looks like a black girl who lost her weave.!
---
Anet bans people for ruining the economy through exploits, right?
---
Someone calculated bots make 3,000g per season. In OP‚Äôs screenshot there are 7 bots. So that‚Äôs 21,000g just for bots for a single season. Let‚Äôs say these bots existed since the first season... that‚Äôs 357,000g (17 seasons since this one isn‚Äôt done yet) earned by bots to use for RMT, scamming, etc. 
---
And that‚Äôs only IF there are just 7 bots but I guarantee there are way more than that? 
---
How is this not bad for the game?
---
only on hero panel
---
That's pretty neat.
---
This is 100% probably the coolest character I‚Äôve seen. Nice job
---
BEETLE RACE
---
Even though Season 2 is the only one that doesn't add new maps.  I feel like it'd make more sense to put 3 or 4 in that spot, tbh
---
Really old bug. Just wait it out.

The idea of the whole Group Screaming *"BURDS!!1"* and dodging alone is entertaining to me...

Pretty bad outside of it though, and forcing a random dodge can fuck up a lot of fights which just isnt fun
---
How do you pick an end-game goal? I keep coming back to GW2 every time they update the living world story, do that, then sit thinking "ok, now what?"
---
I know GW2 is more "sandbox-y" than most mmos these days, but it always feels like I'm not really progressing against anything when I play.
---
What sort of goals can people recommed that that can be easily tracked? so that I know I'm actually making some progress.
---
Yah the amount of "oh hey poi just north of here" "oh wait it's higher" "wait how high is this thing" "WHERE ARE YOU"
---
You'll at least have Episode 6 of Season 4 unlocked, but depending on when you started the rest of S4, S3, and S2 are probably locked.
---
If you open your Hero Panel (H), then click the Story Journal tab (starburst, 4th from the top) you'll see a list of all the seasons and can see which episodes you have unlocked.
---
If you plan on buying all of the episodes anyway, I'd recommend the discounted packs as you'll save 20%.  Open the Gem Store (O), then type "Complete" into the search box or look under the Upgrades tab.
---
Just wait for Tuesday before purchasing the Season 4 Complete Pack, as it will likely have the discount applied after that.
---
Really? I'm borderline retarded as a raider, and I think I must have killed him like twice or more in trainings
---
Yeah you know I did it for being interesting on internet, you got me. But /s aside, is it wrong to ask others for their opinion? Maybe I need to be pushed to right direction while deciding which to try, ESO or GW2. My time is scarse so opinions might help me.
---
That's really useful, thank you
---
Fantastic, thanks very much for the guide, having a look now
---
both of the games are fairly different in terms of how they play, its not really something you will get an answer to from someone else, its a purely subjective matter, personally I can't stand the combat in ESO, but love the combat in GW2, but just because that is my opinion, doesn't mean it can help you at all.
---
There was nothing in your OP that is really something that can be answered, there is no specifics, are you worried about endgame? pvp? gearing? leveling process? combat system? world exploration? story? "is it worth it" isn't a good question :/
---
What the fudge
---
Golden Kappa check
---
she got some sylvari tan
---
i just use firefox and a soundcloud addon, to download them regardless if they set it as downloadable or not
---
first unlock costs 10 points; you have 5 points :)
---
you need to unlock the first minor to be able to equip the dagger(s) and equip the spellbreaker traitline to be able to use daggers. (to equip it you need to have at least 1 trait unlocked)
---
So i'm lagging a bit and finally got enough mastery points to unlock spellbreaker. I unlocked the 1st mastery that says I can equip a dagger in either hand. However the dagger I was given as a "here's your first dagger" says I cannot equip it and I have to unlock spellbreaker.

Missing 5 points
---
I don't think it's a norn thing. But it could be; I know a couple of the Necro's starting masks has some face paint involved.
---
I asked for opinions and I got them. I expected nothing more.
---
Edit: typo
---
Points you have: 5
---
Points you need: 10
---
Its not unlocked yet
---
You also need spellbreaker selected in your spec
---
This.
---
You have to go to your traits and select Spellbreaker there (though you won't be able to select any traits since you don't have any leveled up)
---
They definitely haven't been around for that long. Maybe like the past 3 or so seasons is it more common, though I don't really ever see them at my rank so I might be wrong. And that guy just made an estimate that they CAN potentially, at maximum output, make 3000g per season, not that they will. 
---
I mean, in the context of the game economy, I wouldn't say it's in any real danger because of bots. Even if we assumed maximum output from, let's say, 50 bots in 1 season so 150,000g, that's negligible compared to the totality of the playerbase that's contributing to the market. My meager knowledge of Econ101 tells me that the market will naturally level itself out to equilibrium (as in a healthy state) so, similarly, I wouldn't really say that the gw2 economy is in any danger. 
---
And I don't know if Anet bans people for ruining the economy through exploits or what market exploits would mean in the context of GW2.
---
I don't know in what world Skyscale is faster than Jackal without volatile magic, considering that Jackal doesn't even care if the terrain is flat or not, as it's not affected by it. You also completely missed the part where you can get enough height on both Skyscale and Springer combined with Bond of Faith to get a full dive in with your gryphon. The only mount that the Skyscale can make obsolete is the Springer.
---
Also, I have done map completion on Verdant Brink. It's a map designed with Gliding in mind, and the gryphon is right in its element, considering most of the waypoints there start high up. It's a bad example for your argument.
---
Do you travel with a mistfire wolf? Thats really cool!
---
Did you pick the spellbreaker traitline in traits as well? If you simply unlock but don't replace the berserker traitline with spellbreaker, it won't let you use daggers.
---
Ok thank you. I've been out of the loop for many years while still buying expansions..... XD
---
EDIT: I haven't touched my build in like 6-7 years.... maybe I should wait until I anet releases shareable builds. &gt;&lt;
---
these are hero points, not mastery points. big difference. you need 10 to unlock that thing, but you only have 5. *hence* it's still greyed out and still shows a cost.
---
and even once it's unlocked, you still need to actually equip the elite spec, which - according to your UI - you haven't.
---
They don‚Äôt tell new people that they have to pay even more to experience the full game. That‚Äôs what is disgusting.
---
Legendary crafting
---
Fractal things like high end rewards and fractal god title
---
Pretty sure there is something inside raids, but I don't raid that frequently
---
Skin collection and achievement hunts, making gold daily with things like fractals may help with skin collecting
---
Climb the pvp ladder or collect stuff from there
---
I don't know shit about wvw
---
Not with that attitude you don't.
---
&gt;arguably easy to do as long as you practise it.
---
I tried it, it is really hard for me to fly low without touching the ground and getting through tiny holes at high speed is nearly impossible to me. Maybe I am really bad, or it is just hard. 
---
I think it is a really hard maneuver. But if it is not, then I await your video to prove it.
---
You get the current active LW story episode (season 4, episode 6 in your case) and all future LW stories (as long as you log in at least once while the story is active), but you do not get any of the old LW stuff (S2, S3 and S4 ep 1-5) unless you pay for them in-game.
---
If you're playing the game for the storyline, it kinda sucks to not have that stuff.  Also, LS3 and some of LS4 is the easiest way to get ascended trinkets which are SUPER helpful if you want to get into Fractals.  That said, the seasons aren't absolutely necessary to doing PvE content as there are other ways to get ascended gear for fractals and raids.
---
Yeah, but Anet doesn't give a shit. Milking people with gambling brings in way more money and everyone can bet their ass that no1 at Anet gives a shit that they're milking teens or people that have low willpower regarding stuff like that.
---
Well... kappa indeed
---
(note: we are talking about brave stride, I confused it with the minor in my earlier post)
---
I hadn't realised this tbh and it does not really look like intended behaviour (since HB is supposed to eat all stab) - do we have any confirmation whether its an oversight? (I guess since its probably in game since the HB change it's not, but its an odd inconsistency). In that case it's a fair bit of QoL (I'd still get rid off all the other passive stab sources) even thought I'd still prefer the other two options in an open world scenario.
---
So farming 1h for 1month.....is that considered bad or shitty nowadays? Do any of you know that being patient means and entails?
---
I think Woodenpotatoes either levelled to 80, or did the base story on a ranger without a weapon equipped. Only using pet for damage, and not using any skills.
---
I could be wrong on some of that, so feel free to correct me.
---
&gt;I think in that regard Skyscale competes with Springer and not Griffon.
---
Skyscale can fly and climb while Springer is limited to climb while griffon is limited to fly. 
---
&gt;So I would use Skyscale to climb, but not to fly long distances. Griffon is like the 'Raptor' of flight, while Skyscale is the 'Springer', if that makes sense.
---
I disagree with that. Skyscale is like the Raptor + springer of flight while Griffon is like Roller Beatle of flight. 
---
Raptors and Skyscale are reliable mounts. They're only disadvantage is that they both don't have super-speed. So they are great for short-medium range. 
---
Griffon and Roller Beatle are nearly useless until a certain condition is filled such as finding a tall place and filling up endurance. This niche only makes them useful for long range only. 
---
Plus, Griffon don't have a short leap button like raptor or Skyscale does. So it makes no sense comparing griffon to raptors. 
---
In short, Raptors + skyscale are better at short + medium range while Griffon + beatle is better at long range only.
---
The story mainly but doing the first mission unlocks gliding which is really nice to have even at the basic level. You'll also need things like updrafts and ley gliding for later content like raids.
---
I have 4 Sylvari female, 4 Norn female, 2 asura male, 2 Charr male, 1 human male, 5 Norn male, 4 human female, 2 sylvari male, 1 Charr female, 1 Asura female. I have 2 Human males and 2 sylvari males unleveled though.
---
Of those, I got 8 thieves, 7 mesmers 5 engis, 5 necros, 1 ranger, 1 guard, 1 rev, 1 warrior, 1 ele.
---
Kinda wanna max out characters. It‚Äôs nice getting 2-3 birthday boosters a month.
---
I mean 3 silver not seconds :P
---
as less is available, price goes up. also I would use glyph of reaping for that, but it's still disabled.
---
Time for t5
---
Thanks; unfortunately the build gave an error when I tried to load it...
---
The reason people prefer burst dmg is because mobs die so quickly. Therefore this isn't a particularly good argument for slotting Rampage with the ~~120~~96s cooldown. The 20s cd 3s stun is much more valuable, especially in open world.
---
It's not GW2 specific tho. Most MMOs have garbage PvP and more and more people will just drop it.
---
Still blows my mind that they still didn't add proper GvG.
---
So instabs are too hard now? What is this
---
Is there a way too see what builds they are running?
---
Basically most of the necro are running scepter or Axe with the dagger of focus depends of the game mode so. Yea, but it‚Äôs also a reliable marks since you can‚Äôt dodge this one
---
I want to thank everyone for all of their help.  I've made quite a few changes in my weapons and build.  I'm testing it out, and I'm quite happy with it so far.  I'm a bit squisher, but the best defense is a good is a good offense, right.
---
I really want to get ascended trinkets and armor, but no can do in open world.
---
At least I'm closing in on getting a @#$%\^&amp;\* skyscale.
---
If they got fixed now, I'd kinda miss them. They moved in ages ago, they made that spot their home, they're paying rent... Would be a shame to evict them.
---
I love the cirrent design quite a bit but I cant say im not sad that the original didnt make the cut. It looks more warrior elfish and I still think thats something i would love to see racial wise. Like if we get a whole new slew of elder dragons/gods if they just create a new "perfect" species (elves generally think themselves superior beings so high fantasy continuity achieved) that use the old sylvari design (but obviously not green) itd be sick.
---
&gt; torch for thief
---
Willing to explain?
---
That was pretty damn cool. I really like the alien voice.
---
&gt;  the way this game is sold is that it's confusing to anyone not in the know
---
I've always said this is one of Anets biggest problems. Its really hard to "sell" a expansion(or even the base game) to someone because the bulk of the content is in the LS. How do you list that on a box? You can't. 
---
Every single MMO player is used to: Buy expansion, get everything listed on the box and nothing else. GW2 does a huge shift to that equation and a lot of players don't know how to manage it. Hell, even Anet don't know how to handle it.
---
Have you heard of DLC?  It's not usually included with the base game, and you have to purchase it seperately.   I'm sorry, I just can't be bothered to care about people having to pay 2.50 for an LS episode.  Soz.
---
Got mine from my first chest key on a new character
---
Just vision wars at high level have already more strategy in them compared to anything PvP in GW2
---
Yeah but what about *Tidal*
---
They call you commander because of what happens in the personal story, which you have access to because it's included in the base game.
---
&gt; -Better access to mount skins that don't involve the gem store
---
&gt; -Improved banking system. (600 gems for a bank slot seems a bit excessive)
---
&gt; -Weapon specific dyes
---
GW3 will be released before these even will be put on table, let alone released.
---
How awful.  People have to pay to get content.  What a completely unprecedented occurrence in gaming.

---
So you think being able to cast one auto attack in 20 seconds and nothing else during a fight is completely normal and we should just go with it? Cuz I don't..
---
Rubber banding is fine as well right? But don't worry, soon there won't be enough people even in T1 to cause those problem, so solved.. Praise ANet.
---
Not for a necro it isnt
---
Your response is fucking stupid. Here's why:
---
If you didn't practise, that's your problem. You say you "tried" but try =/= practise, where practise means repeating something several times over (and possibly over several practise sessions) and you failed, so you find it hard.
---
If I make a video of me doing it, that doesn't change the fact you're still apparently going to find it hard for whatever reasons you find it difficult. So you asking me to post a video is still the childish response, and it also doesn't make it *easier* for you to do it just because *I* bothered to sit down, practise and then make and edit a video.
---
Seriously, grow up.
---
Having it be guild based ( or an alliance of them) instead of server based. (This would reduce the wild variance between servers somewhat and allow us to boot people who are spying)
---
Better reward for defending things.
---
Better reward for taking upgraded stuff.
---
More interesting stuff in general (personally would love to see a wvw currency for kills that can be saved up and turned in for summoning an airship or mannable midevil style tanks similar to that one WOW battleground)
---
Some more choke points (soft ones) would also be nice to see on maps. (maybe add a river with some bridges that can be destroyed as well as some moats, which could be upgraded to oil/tar or even punji pits)
---
Better designed towers/keeps would be nice as well.
---
Thank you, I'll be sure to remind them next time I'm dead.
---
World restructuring. That's pretty much it... For me, at least.
---
Overseas at the moment but it's on the list of things to try to add when I get back. No ETA though, as school starts right after I get back too - I do see the demand though and will try to get it implemented at some point.
---
Nice flair!
---
I am little bit confused. You ask a question and then you answer it with what you belive we should feel about WvW. How is that working?
---
As a note, neither of those are the same kinds of "exploits" bots are. Both of those were a massive oversights by Anet, as in it was an internal mistake. There isn't an external force at play there like pvp bots are. 
---
And like I said, the economy of the game is not going to suffer from pvp bots. Those bots are not even a factor to the thousands of people using the market daily. 
---
Yes, the bots probably aren't a good thing but its not because they can impact the economy in any sort of meaningful way. You're missing the point of my post. In any case, believe what you want.
---
&gt; Well... no, all of those quests didn't amount to even 1/3 of my xp bar from level 54-55

I don't honestly know what you were doing then. Because from *my own personal experience* as well as those of no fewer than *a dozen* people in my FC, those quests alongside roulettes and sidequests most definitely get you to 60 before you touch Heavensward. Notice that I didn't say "50-60 is possibly only using those quests". I said "50-60 is possible to do during that ARR break, as the level 50 quests now give you experience". 
---
Ignoring that, I'm also going to disagree with you about dungeons.
---
&gt;The first being that you have access to only low level skills, which often means just spamming low damage crap that drains a lot of MP. 
---
If you're running out of MP, especially post-ShB, you're doing something wrong. I'm not even saying that to be an asshole, that's just kind of fact. If you're running out of MP in a low level dungeon you are *literally* doing something wrong - or the other party members are.
---
&gt; The second being that it's very 1-dimensional; you're just following a guy around that absorbs all the aggro and nothing ever threatens you unless they die. Higher level dungeons don't feel like this because everyone is more involved with mechanics and positioning.
---
Also disagree, higher level dungeons are still following a guy around that absorbs all the aggro and nothing ever threatens you unless they die. Especially, again, since ShB where aggro generation is now braindead easy for a tank to manage. The difference between higher and lower level dungeons is merely bosses, that may or may not have slightly more mechanics. Even then, there are plenty of lower level dungeons that are honestly pretty fun: Stone Vigil is pretty neat, I kind of like Wanderer's Palace and a *lot* of the 50 HM dungeons are kind of fun too, especially as they're re-explorations of older dungeons. But the basic premise of any dungeon, at level 15 or at level 80, is "follow a guy around that absorbs all the aggro and nothing ever threatens you unless they die." That doesn't change.

And the sad part is that the re constructions of the worlds wont work either it will actaully destroy whats left of WvW. If it came when they talked about it the first time then we still had people interested in organizing alliances and actaully play for it, now we don't have that many of them left and WvW is running on low on fuel.
---
Because they do the lazy man way and ban in waves after months while the players have to deal with this shit daily.. But it's fine...Not like PvP is suffering or anythin...oh wait.
---
Gotta love the people who mass downvote without giving an explanation.
---
Why, I see nothing suspicious here at all.. it's just a bread knife she's holding there.. ahem.. right? ;)
---
Do you use any addons?
---
And the raven said, "nevermore"
---
I remember "the list". Is it still around?
---
Based on this post I would reckon you're darn good at reaching, so I'm sure getting that high was no trouble.
---
We did not have mount in the core game for over 3 years. The game is made with a lot of waypoints and speed buffs for you to use just as we did back then when there was no mounts. So don't worry it works without if you don't want to get the expac just yet.
---
If you want to try the roller beetle then there are serveral beetle races in Tyria. That cost a few silver to rent just to have some fun. And during festival like Halloween that comes up soon you can rent mounts and try them out there. Wintersday also have this. So then you know if you enjoy them or not before you get the expansions.
---
They should make thief portal take 50 people and also boost thief stealth capabilities /s
---
There are so many things wrong with the game mode and Anet is only adding more issues instead of resolving the glaring, game breaking issues we have already.
---
Game balance is still the biggest issue, right when they were almost done fixing most of the broken stuff introduced in HoT they introduced so many totally OP PoF specs it became almost unplayable.
---
Technical issues aren't content.
---
Fixing stuff won't add content to the game mode.

I bet she sells Apple pie too. Apples!

I like yours a lot too.. some really talented artists here damn

Great! If you're on EU, give me a poke at the event &lt;3

Not me dude

I see. Why don‚Äôt you use shortbow to pew pew from afar too sanspai üëÄ
---
Your balance comment is just wrong. There are clearly balance issues. There's a reason why in zergs you only see three classes. There isn't perfect balance here, and perfect balance will never be possible, but that doesn't mean cheesy bullshit shouldn't be made less viable, and clearly overpowered classes shouldn't be tuned down. Anet should strive to keep the game as balanced as possible, or else only handful of builds are played.
---
We expect a server that can handle the game mode. When the three zergs get anywhere near close to each other, the game just stops working. You can move, but you can't use any skills with any reliability. Now if this happens in a world boss, it's annoying, but when this happens in WvW it means half the players are going to die to shit that isn't their fault. This isn't fun in competitive modes. If their servers can't handle this many people, then they either need to get servers that can, or limit this from happening. This will probably be fixed with server restructuring, but it's still a massive problem. Also, the game is not F2P. Even if it was, that's no excuse for it not working. They are making money from the product, it should work.
---
It 100% is supposed to be a balanced population. That's why the match ups are based on population. That's why BG doesn't get a linked server. That's why you get a queue when you are over populated in a map. That doesn't mean it's always going to be 50v50v50, but when fights can often be 50v5v15, something needs to be done to help prevent that. Which is exactly what they are trying to solve with restructuring. Again, it's not fun when one server can just demolish you, with nothing you can do about it until more people log on in 3 hours. Server pride is basically gone as it is. A large amount of top players don't stick to one server, they bounce back and forth between other top servers. On high tier servers, there's constant fucking bickering about stupid bullshit, and half the players hate each other. It's a common practice to throw matches to not hit T1, with server leaders constantly bitching about what they should aim for, and freaking the fuck out of someone doesn't follow through with their plan.
---
Basically, we just want proper balance, and world restructuring. The current server format doesn't work well, and is a relic of 7 years ago that should have been replaced when mega servers became a thing. New gameplay features would be neat too, but I think that should be looked at after world restructuring.
---
Comments on youtube (and even WP) seems pretty skeptical, but should be an interesting video for conversation.
---
Thanks Don........another witless comment from you
---
Unfortunately i am on NA but i'll poke you now :)
---
I was falsely reported on, immediately suspended.  Only after I complained to Anet, they removed the suspension after finding out that the report was false.
---
LOL,,,,

If you scroll down, there are some good heavy-armor Cantha-inspired looks in [these search results](https://www.gw2style.com/search.php?searchname=&amp;searchdesc=cantha&amp;searchowner=&amp;world=-1&amp;race=-1&amp;gender=-1&amp;color=-1&amp;dye=-1&amp;armor=3&amp;armorslot0=-1&amp;armorslot2=-1&amp;armorslot4=-1&amp;armorslot1=-1&amp;armorslot3=-1&amp;armorslot5=-1&amp;dosearch=1&amp;sortcol=3&amp;sortdir=0&amp;ipp=100&amp;index=1&amp;displaytype=2).

&gt; We spent half the season under siege by Kralkatorrik
---
under siege is rather bold. these weren't targeted attacks, but rather anomalies. sure, they were caused by him, but - to your knowledge not really much controlled by him.
---
&gt; in an almost impossible situation where killing him means the end of the world
---
we had the choice of either letting him do his thing and risk the entirety of the mists and every world connected to it, including tyria, or only risking tyria and close areas of the mists. not much of a choice, and the outcome was clear the second the threat was brought to our attention.
---
&gt; And yeah, when Aurene died, it DID feel extremely hopeless for the four to five months between episode 5 and episode 6.
---
no. within minutes of her death people correctly speculated correctly of her resurrecting herself through the power of joko, *and that wasn't even the only plausible way she could have returned.* she could have e.g. transferred her mind into another body, mordremoth style.
---
heck, they held a panel about "meaningful character deaths" with her as an example, and yet they still went and made it so that people that play the episodes back to back see her come back to life within 5 minutes.
---
&gt; Hell, even earlier episode, like Domain of Kourna with Joko, felt depressing as hell because of how visually dark the zone looks.
---
visually *bland* might be more accurate.
---
&gt; S4 was extremely dire throughout, and a festival episode is a good relief from it.
---
after bazaar, dragon bash, and a flood of buggy and boring world boss events (seriously, why push so many of them out now so that people get immediately sick of them after they requested stuff like this for seven years. it's the equivalent of stuffing so much candy down a child's throat that they get sick of it and never wanna touch it again), i'd very much appreciate having something to actually do again that doesn't consist of nothing but molesting a dozen fireworks and pinatas once a day (aka pressing F). maybe even throw in something that allows me to increase my AP count past the next achievement chest.
---
Thank you for some useful information.  So you were one of the players caught in the "cheating" sting last year?
---
So there you made your intentions clear. You were never intrested at all you just wanted to slap me around like a cat play with a mouse and then it did not work so you move on. 
---
That is ok though i don't really care and i am certainly allowed to make suggestions on reddit if i like to do so and there are no disclaimers anywere saying i must be a dev who do have all the info and certainly not in this case were you easy can go and check for your self inside of WvW. But then again this was never your intention at all. 
---
But yes do have a good one dear sir :)
---
Wow
---
"this type of behavior"
---
reported for disrespecting  mentally-challenged people
---
They can just add a decap mechanic to SM that makes it neutral after 30 minutes of owning so you create more opportunities for people to fight over it.
---
Rewards should be about doing something meaningful, not killing a guard in every part of the map and getting participation 3 hours later evrn if you didn't do anything. All dailies are tied to ppt and useless pve veteran mobs. There's no valid rewards for killing X amount of people and neither a daily, no daily for removing supplies, no daily for disabling/destroying siege, no difference in flipping an objective instantly compared to 3 hour attempt due to huge amount of defenders, no reward when you actually defend against a lot of people etc etc.
---
It's not just about increasing rewards by certain %. It's about adding meaningful rewards to impactful actions rather than relying on passive ticks, participating without doing anything significant or simply afking.
---
people wasting their time review post histories.....GET A LIFE
---
\\
---
Nah, when they are in special. Some ppl(including me) buy some accounts for the login rewards.
---
Lol dude. You can duo the vast majority of paths considering today's power creep and you're complaining about dungeons taking too long? Have you tried doing them recently at all?
---
Most people don't do that, as it can result in all the accounts being actioned. You should open up a support ticket with the "Report a Player" reason. Be sure to include the account names of all blocked accounts that you believe to be the same person.
---
In general, though, multiple accounts are not uncommon, so that one can reap multiple login rewards per day, amongst other things.

I don't blame them a rich person does not get rich by giving away their strategies.

Thanks

The server stability issues are even bleeding over into large scale PvE now which is a huge disincentive to play the game if I can‚Äôt even play it properly if too many people are around. It‚Äôs a major issue that needs to get fixed. No if, ands, or buts about it 
---
And Gw2 isn‚Äôt really F2P. Its core is F2P with restrictions including no access to expansions (I.e. most of the important content).  The game is B2P by design and should be treated that way since that‚Äôs what it is. 
---
But really, this is a top tier AAA level MMO in the top 5 of all MMOs generally and you‚Äôre trying to cut them slack on server issues because it‚Äôs ‚Äúf2p?‚Äù  Come On now
---
Some people have more fun using certain weapons, regardless if it‚Äôs meta or not. Staves are cool.
